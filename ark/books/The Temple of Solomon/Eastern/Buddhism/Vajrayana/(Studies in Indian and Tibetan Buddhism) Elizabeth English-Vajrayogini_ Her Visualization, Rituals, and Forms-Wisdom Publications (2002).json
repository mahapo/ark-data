It was the inspiration of his research, as well as his personal encouragement, that led me one day to a Sanskrit manuscript in the Bodleian Library dating from the twelfth or thineenth century, and preserved on palm leaves in a lovely, rounded ltu!i/4 script. The text comprised a collection of some fifty sadhanas-meditation and ritual works-all of which were concerned with the practice of Vajrayogini, a deity of the highest tantras. With Professor Sanderson's hdp, and the untir-ing support of Dr. Harunaga Isaacson, I set about the tasks of editing the texts and attempting to understand their contents. Without the knowledge of these two outstanding scholars, I could hardly have begun to fathom the complexity of the Buddhist tantric traditions, let alone begin my doctoral thesis. The thesis was completed in 1999 and was entided Vajrayogini: Hn-Visulllislltion, Rituals anti Forms. This book is an adaptation of that thesis. Taken as a whole, the texts in the manuscript form a so-called garland of sadhanas (sdtihaNlmli/4), which in this case includes praise verses and commentarial passages alongside the ritual and meditation manuals of the sadhanas themselves. This book focuses upon one Sanskrit sadhana &om this unique collection, the Vajrawirtihi StiJha1111 by Umipatideva. At the same time, I hope to give a flavor of the breadth and richness of the other works in the Guhyasa1114Jasdtiha114m4111. For while they all center upon Vajrayogini as the generic deity, they describe many manifestations. Indeed, the collection contains over fifty iconographical descriptions, within which we can discern about twenty distinct forms of Vajrayogini, some of whom-such as Vajravarahi-are significant tantric deities in their own right.

E., and shedding light on tantric sidhana meditation. The decision to base the study upon a single sadhana &om the Gllhya-sam4Jasli4ha11111'Nilti was made for several reasons. While scholarly interest in the Indian Buddhist tantras has increased in recent years, our knowl-edge of their vast array of texts remains in its infancy and will only improve as scholars produce critical editions of surviving texts along with informed study based upon them. The difficulty of drawing accurate conclusions from the texts currendy available is due to the f.act that the umbrella term \"Buddhist tantra\" actually covers a bewildering variety of methods, prac-tices, and systems. These competed in India within a highly fertile and inventive environment over several centuries. Even contemporary accounts in the eleventh to twelfth centuries that describe a range of different sys-tems, such as Abhayikaragupta's encyclopedic Vlljrawdi or Jagad~a's derivative Kriylisamuccaya. cannot be taken as conclusive evidence for prac-tice on the ground, as those authors themselves struggled with the various currents of opinion without necessarily reaching their own conclusions. In addition, the meanings of many terms remain obscure and will only come to light when a f.u broader field of reference is available. Given this complexity, and the need to clarify so many aspects of tantric practice, I chose to focus my study upon a single feature of the whole. Key pieces of the overall picture arc therefore missing. I give only the briefest sketch of the initiations that were the necessary preliminary to sadhana practice, and only a hazy description of the place of sidhana in the tintrika' s overall scheme of spiritual practice. And there are many points where my conclusions arc at best provisional. Within these limitations, I have attempted to highlight those practices that characterize the Indian traditions of Vajrayogini. In so doing, I hope to reveal how our particular author adapted earlier sources and responded to his own scriptural heritage, absorb-ing new trends and reflecting different dcvdopments within the highest Buddhist tantras. The sadhana that I have edited, translated, and studied here is the Vajravlirlihi Stitiha1111 (GSSu) by Umipatideva, an early-twelfth-century author &om northeastern India. This work is a fruitful subject because of the length, clarity, and excellence of its composition. It was also desirable to choose a work from the Guhyasamayaui~Jhttllllmalli collection that was as yet unpublished, because some primary sources dealing with Vajrayogini and Vajraririhi arc already available in recent editions, including some"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"PREFACE XXI studies in European languages. For a long while, the main academic accounts of Vajravarahi and Vajrayogini were the iconographical descrip-tions given by Benoytosh Bhattacharyya in TIN IndiAn BuJJhist Iconogra-phy (192.4) and by Marie Th~rese de Mallmann's Introduction a 11conographu tiM T4ntris1M BowJJhiqw (1975), both of which contain some errors (e.g., n. 228). These works draw heavily on Bhattacharyya's edition of the SliJhanamti/4 (1925 and 1928), which contains fewer than a dozen complete VajrayoginiNajravarahi sadhanas, all of which also appear in the GuhyllSamayllSiidhanama/4. 1 More recent studies also focus on selections from the S4Jha111lm414 sadhanas, such as the shon study ofVajravarahi by Mallar Mitra (1999: 102-29), which is too brief to be fully comprehensive. A beautiful collection of sculptures of the deity from different phases of Tibetan art have been published by von Schroeder (1981, 2001); however some of his iconographical comments arc also erroneous (e.g., n. 83). A few other Sanskrit editions ofVajrayogini sadhanas have been published, such as the shon Vajravtirllhislidhana by Advayavajra (=GSS3) by both Louis Finot (1934) and Richard 0. Mcisczahl (1967), a Tri/u1ytzvlljrayoginislidhana {-GSS25) by Max Nihom {1992), and a handful of sadhanas from the GuhyllSilmllJilSiiJhanamtilii in Dhip (namely, GSSs, GSS1o, GSS26, GSS42, and GSS43), as shown in the appen& Published editions of highest tantric texts also provide an imponant resource for a study ofVajrayoginiNajra-varahi, especially those from the Cakrasarpvara tradition, such as the Yogini-Sil1f'Ciirlltllntra with both its available Sankrit commentaries, edited by J. S. Pandey (1998), and some chapters of the SA,.VIlT'Otlayatantra (possibly a later Nepalese composition)2 edited and translated by Shin'ichi Tsuda {1974). The paucity of publications for the lndic Vajrayogini tradition is in stark contrast to the number of Sanskrit manuscripts that must once have existed. Bongo Buttm no K~nltyu (BBK) catalogs just over a dozen Vajrayogini texts not found in the GuhyasamayllSiidhanamli/4, appearing within works such as the Yab skor {BBK: 261) and Yum skor {BBK: 273-77), commentaries on the TattvlljliliNUa,nJJhi (BBK: 279-'o), the ]va/4valivajram4/4tantra {BB~ 493--94), as well as the later Nepalese Vajravtirllhikalpa in thirty-eight chapters (BBK: 261)-although many sadhana materials listed here are also found in our collection {details in the appendix). We can deduce the existence of yet more Indian Vajra-yogini sadhanas from the number of translations in the Tibetan canon that have no extant Sanskrit original. In an index to the Bka' 'gyur and Bstan 'gyur published in 1980, there are about forty-five sadhanas with Vajrayogini or Vajravirahi in the title, very few of which have (as yet)"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"XXII VAJRAYOGINi been correlated with a Sanskrit original by the compilers of the index. 1 The popularity of the Vajrayogini transmissions in Tibet is remarked upon in the Blut Annals (Roerich 1949-53: 390), which states, \"The majority of tannic yogis in this Land of Snows were especially initiated and followed the exposition and meditative practice of the system known as [the Six Ttxts ofVajravtirtihi] Phag-mo gZhung-dru( (p. 390).4 What is now known of her practice derives mainly from Tibetan Buddhism, in which Vajrayogini (Rdo rje rnal 'byor rna) and Vajravarahi (Rdo rje phag mo) are important deities. Perhaps the main emphasis on forms of VajrayoginiNajravarahi (the names often seem to be used interchangeably) is found in the bKa' brgyud schools. This lineage is traced back to the siddha Tilopa (c. 928-1009), who had many visions of the deity, and who passed on oral transmissions to his pupil, Naropa (c. 956-1040). Naropa also had many visions of 4alcini forms, the most famous of which is recounted in his life story, dated to the fifteenth and sixteenth century.~ in which Vajrayogini appears to him as an ugly old hag who startles him into abandoning monastic scholasticism in favor of solitary tantric practice. However, this account does not appear in the ear-liest biographies (Peter Alan Robens, personal communication: 2002).6 Fig. 1. Ntiro-khtcari. Mongolian woodblock print (IWS/T 77, LC 587) The form ofVajrayogini especially associated with Naropa in Tibet is Nti ro mkha' spyod; \"Na ro [pa]'s tradition of the 4akini\" or \"Naro's khe-cari\" (lie., \"sky-goer\"). This form is discussed below, as it is closest to that of Vajravarahi described in the Indian sadhana translated here by U mapatideva. Several different practices ofVajravarahiNajrayogini were transmitted in the numerous traditions of the Tibetan bKa' brgyud school, through various"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"PREFACE Fig. 2. Naro-lth~cari. Mongolian woodblock print (IWSff 87, LC 597) XXIII teachers; for example, through the translator, Mar pa (Mar pa Chos kyi blo gros, 1012-97) into the Mar pa bKa' brgyud, and through R.as chung pa (R.as chung rOo rje grags pa, I084-1161) into the several branches of the R.as chung sNyan rgyud, and yet another through Khyung po rnal 'byor, founder of the Shangs pa bKa' brgyud (eleventh-twelfth centuries) appar-ently from Niguma (sometimes said to be Naropa's sister). This complex matrix of lineages continued in Tibet within the various bKa' brgyud tra-ditions. In the Karma bKa' brgyud, the oral transmission was written down in the form of a sadhana by the third Karma pa, Rang byung rdo rje (b. 1284) (Trungpa 1982: 150). However, it is a sadhana by the sixth Karma pa (m Thong ba don ldan, 1416-53) that serves as the basis for the main textual source in this school. This is the instruction text composed in the sixteenth century by dPa' bo gTsug lag phreng ba (1504-66).7 Vajravarahi also appears in bKa' brgyud versions of the guruyoga, in which the devotee worships his guru (in one popular system, Mi Ia ras pa) while identifying himself as Vajravarahi. Examples include the famous \"four sessions\" guruyoga (Thun bzhi'i bla ma'i rna/ 'byor) of Mi skyod rdo rje, the eighth Karma pa (1507-54), and the Ng~s don sgron m~. a meditation manual by the nine-teenth-century teacher Jam mgon Kong sprul (1977: 119fT.), itself based on a sixteenth-century root text, the Lhan cig slty~s sbyor lthrid by the ninth Karma pa (dBang phyug rdo rje, 1556-1603). While Karma bKa' brgyud lamas around the world today frequently give the initiation ofVajravarahi, they observe a strict code of secrecy in imparting the instructions for her actual practice; however, published accounts of some practices within some bKa' brgyud schools are now available. 8 Vajrayogini is also an important deity within the Sa skya school. Accord-ing to Lama Jampa Thaye (personal communication: 2002),\" her practices"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"XXIV VAJRAYOGINI were received into the Sa skya tradition in the early twelfth century, during the lifetime of Sa chen Kun dga' snying po (1092-II58), first of the \"five ven-erable masters\" of the Sa skya. Sa chen received from his teachers the initi-ations, textual transmissions, and instructions for three forms of Vajrayogini. 10 The first is a form derived also from Niropa, and again called Na ro mkha' spyotior \"Niiros khecari,..(although it is entirely different from the Tilopa-Naropa-Mar pa transmission ofVajraririhi in the bKa' brgyud in that the deity has a different iconographical form with a distina set of associated practices). The second is a form derived from the siddha Maitripa, known therefore as Maitri Khecari (Mttri mltha' spyoJ 111/l; see fig. 18). The third is derived from the siddha lndrabhuti, known therefore as Indra KMcari (lnJra mkha 'sypoJ 111/l; see fig. 6). This form is sometimes also known as /Nira Vajravarahi, although as a deity in her own right, Vajravarahi has received much less attention among Sa skya pas than the Khecari lineages. 11 These three forms are traditionally considered the highest practices within a colleaion of esoteric deity practices known as Tht Thirt«n Go/Jm Dhamuzs of Sa sltya (Sa sltya I gsn-chos bcu fl'ITn), as they are said to lead directly to transcendental attainment. •z However, it was Naro IONcari who became the focus of most devotion in the Sa skya tradition, and the prac-tice instructions associated with her sadhana were transmitted in the form of eleven yogas drawn from the siddha Niropa's own encounter with Vajra-yogini. The most influential exposition of this system of eleven yogas emerged in the sixteenth century; known as Tht Ultim~~tt Stcrtt Yoga, it is a composition by 'Jam dbyangs mkhyen brtse dbang phyug (Is24-68) on the basis of oral instructions received from his master, Tsar chen Blo gsal rgya mtsho (1494-1560). n Since that time, the eleven yogas \"have retained great importance in the Sa skya spiritual curriculum\" (ibitJ.). The practices have retained their esoteric status for Sa skya pas, and are \"secret• in as much as one may not srudy or praaice them without the requisite initia-tions and transmissions. In the eighteenth century, it appears that the Sa skya transmission of Naro Khecari and the eleven yogas entered the dGe lugs tradition. This seems to have occurred in the lifetime of the Sa skya master, Ngag dbang kun dga' legs pa'i 'byung gnas. His exact dates are unclear, but the next Sa skya lineage holder is his pupil, Kun dga' blo gros (1729-83). Ngag dbang kun dga' legs pa'i 'byung gnas is in fact the last of the Sa skya lineage hold-ers given in dGe lugs sources (he appears as \"Nisarpa\" in the list given by K. Gyatso 1999: 343-46), and from this point, the dGe lugs lineage prayers"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"PREFACE XXV reveal their own distinct sequence of transmissions (ibitl.). The dGe lugs pa had originally focused upon Vajrayogini/Vajravarahi in her role as conson to their main deity, Cakrasarpvara, following the teaching ofT song kha pa (1357-1419). Cakrasarpvara was one of the three meditational deities, along with Yamantaka and Guhyasamaja, whose systems Tsong kha pa drew together as the foundational practices of the dGe lugs school. In this con-text, Tsong kha pa's explanatory text, Illuminating All HiJJm Meanings (s&u Jon !tun gsa/) is apparendy the main source on Vajrayogini (K. Gyatso 1999: xii); and she has actually been described as Tsong kha pa's \"innermost yidam, kept very seemly in his hean\" (Ngawang Dhargyey 1991: 9). This claim, however, was probably intended to bolster Vajrayogini's relatively recent presence in the dGe lugs pantheon, as the Sa skya tradition of eleven yogas was only popularized in the dGe lugs in the twentieth cenurury, by Pha bong kha (1878-I94J). According to Dreyfus (1998: 146), \"Pa-bong-ka differed in recommending Vajrayogini as the central meditational deity of the Ge-luk tradition. This emphasis is remarkable given the fact that the practice of this deity came originally [i.e., as late as the eighteenth century] from the Sa-gya tradition and is not included in Dzong-kha-ba' s original synthesis.\" The Vajrayogini practice passed on by Pha bong kha and his pupil, Kyabje Trijang, focuses on the set of eleven yogas; and despite their esoteric, and therefore highly secret, nature-and the absolute prerequisite of receiving correct empowerments---cxplanations of these practices have been published and are widely available in English: by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso b991/99), Geshe Ngawang Dhargyey (1992.), and Khensur Rin-poche Lobsang Tharchin (1997).'4 The rNying rna has also drawn the practices ofVajrayoginiNajravarahi into its schools. Her presence is read back into the life ofPadmasambhava, the eighth-century founder of the rNying rna, who is said to have received initiation from Vajravarahi herself following his expulsion from the coun of King lndrabhiiti (Dudjom 1991: 469). Other imponant rNying malin-eage holders are also traditionally associated with the deity. For example, in the life story of Klong chen Rab 'byams pa (1308-63), as given by Dud-jom Rinpoche (1991), he is said to have received visions of both a white Varahi and a blue Vajravarahi, who foretell Klong chen pa' s own meeting with Padmasambhava (ibitJ.: 577, 58I).It is also Vajravirihi who leads him to the discovery of the treasure text (gttr mA), Innmnost Spirituality of tht f?alti!'i ((Miln ngag) mltha' p mying tig), the meaning of which is explained to him by Yeshe Tsogyel (Ye shes mtsho rgyal) (ibitl.: 586).

In the account ofYcshe Tsogyd's life, a gtn' ma discovered in the eighteenth century (and now translated no fewer than three rimes into English), she is at times clearly identified with VajrayoginiNajravarahi (e.g., Dowman 1984: 38, 85, 178); indeed, her sa,bhogaltaya is said to be that of the deity (e.g., Gyelwa Jangchub in Dow-man 1984: 4-5, 224; Klein 1995i: 147; J. Gyatso 1998: 247). The identifica-tion ofYcshe Tsogycl with Vajrayogini/Vajravarahi is also suggested by Rig 'dzin 'Jigs med gling pa (173<>-98), whose I)altlris Grand s~cnt TaUt is revealed to him by a \"paradigmatic\" qakini, whom J.

In other guruyoga practices, such as TM Bliss Path of Lib\"ation (Thar pa I bek 14m), the practitioner identifies dirccdy with Vajrayogini, who becomes \"the perfect exemplar of such devo-tion\" (Rigdzin Shikpo 2002: personal communication). 16 Over and above the deity's ubiquitous involvement in guruyoga medi-tations (a feature, as we have seen, of many Tibetan traditions), her pop-ularity as a main deity in her own right is revealed by the growing number ofliturgics devoted to her practice in the later rNying rna traditions. Robert Mayer (personal communication: 2002) mentions entire ritual cycles devoted to Vajravarahi, such as a volume entitled, Union of All s~cr~t I)altinis (mKha' gro gsang ba !tun iJus ltyi chos sltor). This was composed by the eminent nineteenth-century figure, 'Jams dbyangs mkhyen brtse'i dbang po, who believed it to be the \"funher revelation\" (yang gt\") of a gt\" ma dating back to the thirteenth century. The original gtrr ma revelation was by the famous female rNying rna gt\" ston Jo mo sman mo, herself deeply connected with Vajravarahi (ibitJ.; Allione 1984: 209-11). This vol-ume is entirely dedicated to an important form ofVajravarahi in rNying rna practice, which is related to the gCod tradition, from Ma gcig lab sgron rna (1031-1129) (Allione ibiJ.: 142-204). Here, the deity takes the wrath-ful black form of (ma cig) Khros/Khro ma nag moor Krodhalttili, also some-times identified as Rudra!lili (Mayer op. cit.). Patrul Rinpoche (1994: 297-98) describes an iconographical form that, apart from its color, is much the same as that of Indra#Jtini(for a full tangka of KroJhalttiliwith"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"PREFACE xxvii retinue, see Himalayan An, no. 491). In full, however, this is an extremely esoteric practice and, in the case of the principal bDud 'joms gtn-'INl cycles at least, is regarded as \"so secret and powerful that practitioners are often advised to either take it as their sole practice, or not seek the initiation at all\" (Mayer op. cit.). Tibetans also recognize a living reincarnation trulltu (sprul situ) of Vajravarahi (rOo rje phag mo). The first trulku was a pupil ofPhyogs las rnam rgyal (also known as 'Jigs med grags pa and as Chos kyi rgyal mtshan, 1376-1452.), the learned Bo dong Pat] chen of the monastery Bo dong E (probably a bKa' gdams pa foundation in 1049). ABo dong pa Monastery was subsequently founded at bSam sdings by the side of Y ar 'brog mtsho (Yamdrog Lake), referred to as Yar 'brog bSam sdings dgon pa, and it was here that the trulku of rOo rje phag mo became established (Rigdzin Shikpo 2.002.: personal communication). The first abbess is one of the most famous incarnations, memorable for escaping from an invasion in 1717l19 of the Dzungar T anars by apparendy causing everyone in the monastery to appear as a herd of grazing pigs. But later incarnations have also been revered, and famed for their connection with Vajravarahi, until the present trulku (b. 1937l38) who became an eminent official in the Chinese administration (Simmer-Brown 2.001: 185-86; cf. Taring 1970: 167; Willis 1989: 104). The pervasiveness ofVajrayogini/Vajravarahi in Tibet is attested by her appearance also within the Tibetan Bon tradition. Peter Alan Roberts (per-sonal communication: 2002.) has translated a meditation text by Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan (1859-1934) that focuses on the development of the experience of \"the wisdom of bliss and emptiness\" (bek stong yt sh~). with \"heat\" (gtum mo/ca!'f!4Ji) as a sign of accomplishment. The work is entitled Tht Inftrno ofWistlom {Yt shts 1M Jpung) 11 and draws on Bon compositions going back to the eleventh or twelfth century gttr 1M texts. It describes a wrathful, cremation-ground Qakini named Thugs rjes Kun grol ma (\"She Who Liberates All through Compassion\") who is dearly a form ofVajra-virihi. She is ruby-red in color, adorned with skulls, and stands on one leg in the dancing posture; a black sow's head protrudes from her crown, and she brandishes a chopper aloft, holds a skull bowl of fresh blood to her heart, and clasps a skull staff in the crook of her left shoulder. The sym-bolism governing her attributes, as well as the metaphysical context of emptiness, all appear in typical Vajravarahi sadhanas in the Buddhist tantric traditions. The practice ofVajrayoginiNajravarahi is not exclusive to Tibet, how-ever. In Nepal, Vajrayogini is popularly worshiped as one of a set of four"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"xxviii VAJRAYOGINi varihis or yoginis: Guhydvari (also worshiped as Prajtiaparamita, Nairat-myi, and Agniyogini), Vidydvari of Kathmandu, Vajrayogini ofSankhu, and Vajrayogini ofPharping (Slusser 1982.: 2.56, 32.7). There are several tem-ples ofVajravirihi and Vajrayogini in the Kathmandu Valley, for example, at Chapagaon Grove (ibiJ.: 325-26, 341), and at the hilltop temple ofPhar-ping (ibiJ.: 331). In Sankhu, Vajrayogini is the tutelary deity of the town, and her temple is dedicated to the fierce cremation ground goddess \"Ugrawa Vajrayogini\" (Slusser 1982.: 72. with n. 141). Here, Vajrayogini is also identified with Prajfiaparamira, \"mother of all tathigatas,\" and is con-sidered the spouse ofSvayambhu or Adibuddha, who is housed in a smaller shrine on the same site, while in the Hindu version of the local myth, she is identified with Siva's consort, Durga (Zanen 1986: 131). Gellner (1992: 256) comments that in Nepal, \"Vajrayogini scems ... to play a role in unit-ing exoteric deities, such as Tara or Kumari and the Eight Mothers, with the consons of the secret tantric deities, viz. Vajravirihi ... jfiina4akini ... and Nairitmyi., Gdlner goes on to describe tantric rites of initiation in cur-rent Newar practice that are taken mainly by Vajr.icirya and Sakya males (ibiJ.: 169-270). Here, \"Tantric initiation (Ji/q4) means primarily the ini-tiation ofCakrasarpvara and his consort Vajravarahi\" (ibid.: 268). The rites of initiation themselves are considered highly esoteric and are guarded with secrecy (jbU/.: 2.73-80). Gellner's description-gleaned with difficulty from a learned informant-provides a rare insight into the modem-day prac-tices. The first part of the initiation focuses upon Cakrasatpvara, and is based on handbooks that follow the twelfth-ccntwy exegetical work, the Kriyasamuccaya. The second part of the rite focuses on the consort Vajravarahi (or \"Vajradcvi\") and is based upon material taken from the Sa1J1varodaJatantra, but also upon as yet unidentified sources (ibid.: 272). Despite drawing from early tantric sources, the rites currendy in use in Nepal have been substantially altered in the process of taming and adapt-ing them to suit tantric initiates who are householders (ibiJ.: 300ff.). Never-theless, the preeminence ofVajravirihi in the tantric pantheon is retained in the modern Newar system. The series of rites that comprise the tantric initiation culminates with initiation into the practice ofVajravarahi, thus indicating her supreme position within the hierarchy of Ncwar religious practice (ibiJ.: 280; cf. ibiJ.: 2.61-62). From this brief overview of the practices ofVajrayogini and Vajravarahi outside India, it should be evident that we are dealing with a deity of major significance within tantric Buddhism. It is therefore unsurprising to find, within the burgeoning of modem publications on the highest tantras, a"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"PREFACE XXIX number of works that also relate to the subject. Some impressive studies on the 4akini have appeared, such as the detailed monograph by Adelheid Her-rmann-Pfimdt (1992) and valuable explorations by Janet Gyatso (1998) and Judith Simmer-Brown (2001). Such studies tend to range also across other academic disciplines; notably, the image of the yogini or 4akini has inspired a large body of crosscultural and feminist theological discourse. •• My own approach is predominantly textual: I have explored the con-tents of a major Sanskrit source that sheds light on the Indian origins of Vajrayogini practice and underpins later traditions. The importance of the Guhyas11wutyast1Jha1Ulmtilll to the study ofVajrayoginiN ajravarahi can hardly be overstated. Within this, I have restricted the scope of my work to Sanskrit sources (and as I do not know Tibetan, I am greatly indebted to others in the few instances where I cite Tibetan texts). My aim has been, simply, to represent my sources as faithfully as possible, either by translating or summarizing their contents. Although this type of under-taking may itself be prone to, perhaps even determined by, all kinds of sub-jective and cultural interpretation and selectivity by its author, I have tried to present the material in a manner that is more descriptive than inter-pretive. For example, my usc of the masculine pronoun throughout reflects the usage in my source material; this, despite the fact that the practice of VajrayoginiNajravirihi was-and certainly is-undertaken by women as well as men. What I hope emerges here is as accurate a record as I am able to give of the early origins of the cult from the textual evidence that remains to us. I have begun in chapter 1 by locating Vajrayogini within the complex tra-ditions of the Buddhist tantras. I then tum to the Guhytts411UlJIIS~ itself and explore what is known of its provenance, both of its authors and of the tantric sidhana that makes up the bulk of its contents. Chapter 2 forms a survey of all the different forms of Vajrayogini within the GuhyiiSil11UlJIISilllhll111lmlill1, and also of the various ritual contexts in which these forms arc evoked. It therefore gives an overview of the cult in India as it emerges from these texts. Chapter 3 is a study of one particular sadhana from the collection, the Vlljravarlihi Sdtihii1Ul by Umipatideva, which is divided into its own distinctive meditation stages and final ritual portion. The Sanskrit edition (with notes) and the translation to the sadhana follow chapter 3· The appendix gives a list of all sadhanas in the Guhytts4mll)IZ-SiiJhii1Ulmt114 (with witnesses where I have found them) and a summary of their contents."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"XXX VAJRAYOGINI Acknowledgments It is a great delight to acknowledge the generosity of my teachers, colleagues, friends, and f.unily.

Vajrayogini and the Buddhist Tantras THE. CULT OF TANTIUC GODDESS, Vajrayogini, flowered in India between the tenth and twelfth centuries c.E.. at a mature phase of the Buddhist tantras. One of the most important sources for her practice in India is a collection of sadhanas. A sidhana is a meditation and ritual text-literally, a \"means of attainment\" (sitihan~~m}-that centers upon a chosen deity, in this case, upon Vajrayogini or one of her various manifestations. This particular collection was written and preserved in San-skrit and drawn together under the late, collective tide, the Guhyasa1Nl]ll-~ (GSS). It is one of these sadhanas that is edited and translated in this book, and that serves as the basis for our exploration of the goddess, particularly in her form as Vajravirihi. Who is Vajrayogini? The texts refer to her reverentially as a \"blessed one\" (bhatllVIlti), as a \"deity\" (tkvatli) or \"goddess\" (tkvi). She is divine in the sense that she embodies enlightenment; and as she is worshiped at the cen-ter of a mal}4a(a of other enlightened beings, the supreme focus of devo-tion, she has the status of a buddha. In the opening verse to the Vajravardhi Stldh4114, the author salutes her as a vlljrllMvi, that is, as a Vajrayana or tantric Buddhist ( vajra) goddess, and in the final verse prays that all beings may become enlightened like her, that is, that they may attain \"the state of the glorious vajra goddess\" (lrivajraMviptu/Avi). Th~ BuJJhist Tantric Systnns T antric Buddhism is the wing of the Mahayana that revolves around mantra as a path or \"way,\" and that is known therefore as the Manttayina or Mantranaya, or as the Vajrayina after one of its primary symbols, the vajra. A pithy definition of tantra is elusive.19 Vaifl}avism, Saivism, and"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"2. VAJRAYOGINi other Indian religions including Buddhism all developed rich tantric tra-ditions, and the term broadly denotes particular types of ritual employed within their various deity cults. \"Tantra'' also refers to the various bodies oflitcraturc within these traditions: scriptural and exegetical texts that pro-vide instructions for attainments, both spiritual and mundane. One gains an idea of the size of the Buddhist tantric tradition alone when one con-siders that it evolved in India for a thousand years {from about the second century c.E.), and that this process has continued in Tibet and beyond for another thousand. The main production of tantric texts occurred in India between about the third and twelfth centuries. Some indication of the numbers involved can be gleaned from the sheer quantity of works trans-lated from Sanskrit into Tibetan from the end of this period. The tantric portion of the Tibetan canon contains almost five hundred tantric scrip-tures and over three thousand commentarial texts; Isaacson {2001: per-sonal communication) suggests there may exist as many as three thousand Buddhist tantric texts in Sanskrit, of which over a quarter-perhaps many more--have not been translated into Tibetan or any other language. 20 In order to locate Vajrayogini and her cult within this vast spiritual corpus, it is worth beginning with a brief summary of Buddhist tantric literature. But with so many texts to consider, and with such an array of practices and methods revealed within them, where is one to begin? The problem of how to classify and codify the material has occupied scholars from at least the eighth century and does so even today as contemporary scholars con-tinue to propose new ways of approaching and organizing the materials (e.g., Linrothe 1999). The result is that there are various systems for cate-gorizing the Buddhist tantras that arc by no means standard, and how these different classes of texts arose, or came to be known, is something of a mystery. It seems that one of the earliest classifications of the Buddhist tantras occurred in the eighth century by Buddhaguhya, who recognized only two classes, kriyatantras and yogatantras (Mimaki 1994: 122, n. 17). The subject-matter of some tantras, however, was neither principally ltriyd (ltriyapra-dhana), nor principally yoga (yogqraJhana). but seemed to combine \"both\" (ubhaya); these were termed ubhayatantras, and later, caryatantras (Isaac-son 1998). It is this threefold classification-kriya-, carya-, and yoga-tantras-to which an eighth-century scholar/practitioner, Vilasavajra, confidently refers. Of these classes, the earliest tantric texts are found within the kriyatantras (\"action tantras\"), which appeared between at least the third century, when they are known to have been translated into Chinese"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi AND THE BUDDHIST TANTRAS 3 (Hodge 1994: 74-76), and at least the sixth century. The so-called carya-tantras (\"performance tantras\") were current from at least the mid seventh with the emergence of its root text, the Vllirocanlibhisa'!'bodhi (ibiJ.: 6sff.) Despite their status as \"tantras,\" rdigiow teachings supposedly revealed by the historical Buddha, these classes hold essentially ritual manuals and dhara!Jis concerned with supernatural, desiderative attainments (siJJhis), such as locating treasure, alchemy, flying. invisibility, forcing access to heav-enly realms, warding off evils, and so on; they make little reference to sote-riological goals. Sanderson (1994b: 97 n. 1) comments on the enduring popularity of the kriya-and caryatantras, even among translators of later soteriological tantras (such as Arnoghavajra, d. 774), as well as their con-tinuing importance in apotropaic rituals in Newar, Tibetan, and Japanese Buddhism. The fascination with sit/Jhis of variow types remains in later tantric literature, as the study ofVajrayogini will show. By distinguishing the kriyatantras (or the kriya-and caryatantras) from the yogatantras, the eighth-century scholars were in fact pointing to the emergence of a new kind of tantra that had entered the Buddhist arena, probably from the late seventh century (Hodge op.cit.: 65~6, 58). The root text of the yogatantra is the SttnNZtathagatatllttviiSil'!'graha (SITS), and like the caryatantras, it centers on the supreme buddha, Vairocana. However, it reveals an important shift in emphasis. This is the first work in which tantric methodologies, such as rites of consecration, mantras, and ~4afas, were directly aligned to soteriological as well as to desiderative goals. The significance of bringing a liberationist slant to bear on tantric methods was not lost upon commentators, who were clearly aware of the need to bring traditional Buddhist values into the tantric field. Vtlasavajra, for example, wrote a commentary based on the Vajradhatum~4ala of the SITS, in which he set out \"to encode and interpret tantric ritual in Mahayanist doc-trinal terms\" (Tribe 1994: 4).21 Ponions of yogatantra text are probably the oldest incorporated into the literature ofVajrayogini. Even within Vilasavajra's exegesis, however, there was other liberationist material that did not fit easily into the yogatantra category, a fact he seems to have recognized by designating his root text, the Nlim4S4'!'giti, a \"mahayoga\" or \"great tantra\" (Tribe 1997: 128, nn. n, 18, and 20). Indeed, new kinds of texts with marked differences in subject matter were begin-ning to emerge, and these were soon to be contrasted with the yogatantras and given the new designation uyoginitantras.\" Within the soteriological tantric realm these two terms--yogatantra and yoginitantra-scem to refer to the two main divisions of Buddhist tantras, and commentators frcquendy"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"4 VAJRAYOGJNl pair them together as the \"yoga-and yoginitantras. \"22 Thus, the common-est classification of tantric texts in India was probably fourfold: kriy:i-, cary:i-, yoga-, and yoginitantras (Isaacson 1998). The yoginitantra class is charaaerizcd by the appearance of a new Buddha at the center of its maJ]9alas, namely ~obhya and his manifestations, supreme enlightened beings who belong to the vajra (\"diamond\" or \"thun-derbolt\") family of deities. These deities are wrathful in appearance with a startling affinity for places of death and impurity, the cremation grounds; they also manifest a vivid sexual symbolism. 2' One of the key cults within this class is based on the tantric deity Hevajra and was probably emerging around or after the tenth century.l<t In the Hn~ajratantra, Hevajra is seen to be a hmJta form, that is, a type of wild enlightened being who dwells in cremation grounds with a retinue of cremation-ground deities and spirits. Other yoginitantra systems, probably roughly contemporary with the H~vajratantra, also center on this type of h\"\"lta deity: Cakrasarpvara, CaJ]4amah:iro~aJ)a, Buddhakap:ila, Mah:im:iy:ihva, and K:ilacakra are all heruka forms who appear as lords of their own maJ)4aJas. Their appearance, accoutrements, and behavior all relate to practices that ascetics undcnook while dwelling in cremation grounds. These arc the ltapalilta observances, or observances based on the skull (ltapa/ab. /tapa/am), chief tool and sym-bol for yogins of this kind. The heruka lord is also worshiped in embrace with his consort, while the retinue of male and female deities in his maJ)4a}a may also be in sexual union. The principle of ialtti begins to emerge in these texts as a potency man-ifesting in powerful female deities. It comes to the fore through the figure of the female consorts and the many types of goddesses, witches, or female spirits-yoginis and <Jalcinis-who haunt the wilds and live in the crema-tion grounds. As Sakti is increasingly emphasized, texts tend to redefine tra-ditional Mahayana soteriology in the language of erotica-yogic techniques and mah:imudr:i (p. 91). Thus, as one tantra explains: \"The Mahayana is mah:imudr:i, and yoginis bring magical power. \":rs It is these texts that form the direct basis for the cult ofVajrayogini. Within the yoginitantras we sec a growing preoccupation with the yogini, or enlightened female deity. In some maJ)4a}as she is worshiped as the chief deity within a predominandy female maJ]Qala, even though she is still in embrace with a male panncr (e.g., see ch. 2). Eventually, cults emerged in which the male consorts dis-appeared entirely &om view, leaving the female deity to be worshiped alone at the center of a new maJ)9ala. Often the form of the Ma1]9ala is preserved exactly as it was before, except that the male deities have simply been"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINI AND THE BUDDHIST TANTRAS 5 removed. This is typical of the 1Jla.94alas described in the sadhanas of the GuhymamayastUlhaNZm414. Our study of the Vajravmhi m~Qala in Umipatideva's Vajravartlhi SaJhana will show that it is modeled exactly upon that of Cakrasatpvara, except that in Vajravirihi' s m~Qala all the male gods of Cakrasarpvara's mar:tQala have disappeared, leaving the god-desses without consorts, and supreme. Our summary so far of the tantric systems has shown the cult ofVajra-yogini to be firmly grounded within the yoginitantra class. But this classi-fication is more complex than I have made out. On the one hand, there were already texts akin to the yoginitantras well before the maturing of the Heruka cults in the ninth and tenth centuries; the SarvabutitJhasJtmtiyoga-t!tZftinijliWa'!'vara is one such \"proto-yoginitantra\" that is known to have been in existence in the mid-eighth century (Sanderson 1995).26 Here, the lords of the 1Jla.94alas are heruka-type, esoteric deities, in sexual union with consorts and surrounded by retinues of female 4akinis. This tantra was still in use in Tibet in the eleventh century, \"no doubt because of its evident kin-ship with the later yoginitantras\" (ibiJ.). On the other hand, there were texts that sat uncomfortably within the yogatantra system, but that were not so markedly different that they fell naturally into the yoginitantra classifi-cation. This gave rise to another tantra class known as the \"yogottara,\" lit-erally that which is \"higher than the yoga [class].\" Isaaaon (op.dt.) suggests the term \"yogottaratantra\" was a later designa-tion. Certainly when Vilisavajra refers to the Guhymll11Uijatantra, and to other texts that were later named as \"yogottara,\" such as the Vajrabhairava-tantra and the Mdyajtllat4ntra, he seems to be unaware of any such class (Tribe 1994= s). This stratum of tantric literature arose about a century after the yogatantras, and its root text, the Guhyasllmajatantra, was codified and translated into Tibetan in the eighth century (Matsunaga 1972; Sndlgrove 1987: 183). The introduction of this extra \"yogottara\" classification seems to reflect the &a that in the course of its evolution, the Guhyasamija system (including its exegetical literature) came to be seen as sufficiendy different from the older yogatantras-and certainly superior to it-to require a dif-ferent label (Isaacson op.dt.). As in the yoginitantras, the rnaJ)4aJas of the Guhyasamija (or Samaja) tradition are presided over by Alqobhya and by vajra-&mily deities, who are often both wrathful and erotic in character. Since the tantras of the yogini class were deemed superior even to those of the yogottara, Isaacson suggests that they probably received the additional designation \"yoganiruttaratantras,\" literally: \"tantras of the highest (nirut-tara) [division] of the yoga [class]\" (translation by Sanderson 1994b: 98 n. 1)."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"6 VAJRAYOGINI Even this fivefold classification of kriya-, carya-, yoga-, yogottara-, and yoginitantras (the system almost ubiquitously expounded in our secondary literature) was not necessarily a widely accepted solution by scholars/prac-titioners of the day. Mimaki (1994) lists seven different classifications from various Indian exegetes and tantras, without even touching on the fourfold schema described above as possibly the most common (i.e., kriya-, carya-, yoga-, and yoginitantras). Atisa, for example, writing in the early mid-eleventh century, sought to clarify works that strayed between the yoga and yogottara camps by inserting between them two more tantra dassc:s--upaya-(\"mcans\"), and ubhaya-(\"dual\")-thus presenting a new sevenfold classi-fication of tantras. In Tibet, the classification of texts likewise presents a complex picture (Mimaki 1994: 121). Among the gSilr mapa schools, there is the famous system of Bu ston (129<r1346), which preserves the divisions of the kriya-(bya ba'i rgyud), carya-(spyod pa'i rgyuti), and yoga-(mal 'byor gyi rgyuti), but which classes those of the yogottara-and yoginitantras together as the anuttaratantra, or \"ultimate tantra\" (rrud 'byor b/a na rMa pa 'i rgywi). This founh class is itself subdivided into father (phar gyuti), mother (mar gyuti). and nondual tantras (gnyis m~J rgyuJ). Mother tantras, or wisdom tantras (y~sh~s rgyutl) are further analyzed into seven groups, one of which (itself with five subdivisions) comprises tantras connected with Heruka (Tsuda 1974: 28). The classification of the rNying rna tantric canon is based on a ninefold system of classification, in which such categories as mahayoga (noted above) re-emerge as a distinct group (Germano 1994: 241-51 with n. 114, Williams and T ribc: 2000: 203). Complicated as the divisions and subdivisions of the tantric corpus are, they have been made more so by mistranslations in use in the West. Sanderson (1993) has pointed out that the term anuttarayogatantra found in some secondary sources docs not occur in Sanskrit enumerations of the different classes of rantras and is likely to derive from an incorrect back-formation from the Tibetan rna/ 'byor b/a m~J ltyi rgyuJ or \"yoganiruttara-tantras., (This refers to the class of Sanskrit works whose translations in the T ohoku catalogue are nos. 36<r441, also termed rna/ 'byor ma 'i rgyud or \"yoginitantra\"; Sanderson 1994b: 98 n. 1). The term \"yoganuttara-tantras· (sometimes applied by secondary authors to yoganiruttara-tantras) is also not attested in Sanskrit sources (Isaacson 2001: personal communication).

It draws instead upon the scriptural texts of the Cakrasarpvara cult: the Sarpvara-, or Sarpvaratantras. 27 Sanderson (1995) summarizes the Sarpvara corpus as follows: The root text (mullltantram) is the Laghu.la1f1varatantra, also called HmJ!tabhiJhana-or Cakrasa'!lvaratllntra(BBK: 251). The text does not survive in its entirety; lost ponions are accessible only through the early eleventh-century Tibetan translation, lem-mata in tenth-century Sanskrit commentaries, and in secondary texts such as the Abhitihinottllratllntra. The AbhiJhtinottllratllntra (BBK: 254). Its relationship with the Ultrasa1f1varatllntra is that of explanatory tantra (\"'vyti!thya-tantram) to root text (miilllt4ntrtzm), according to Buddhaguhya's terminology.

It is scriptures such as these--in panicular, the Yoginisa1f1ctlratantra, Sa,varotiayat~~ntra, and Abhitihanottllratllntra-that inform the sadhanas of the GuhyasamayastiJhanamilti. One sadhana in the collection (GSS7o) is based upon a unique Vajravarahi scriptural source, the Varahyabhyu-J4yatantra, itself apparently extracted from the Abhitlhanottllratantra (Sanderson 2001a). In another, there is even a reference to the I..alt,abhi-Jhinlfl (sometimes identified with the Khasamatllntra), which is a mythi-cal work, supposedly vast and authoritative in ten thousand verses, and allegedly the source from which the CttkrllSil1f1VIlrat4ntra itself was extracted (fsuda 1974: 33). The same legendary authority is claimed in the Yoginisa'!l-ctlratantra following its description of the body m~cJala, a core Cakra-sarpvara practice taken over with very little adaptation in Umapatideva's Vajravarlihi StiJhana.

This is a group of some fony-six San-skrit works drawn together as a collection centering upon Vajrayogini and her manifestations. Fifteen of its works claim the authorship of named indi-viduals, and it is to them that we now turn in order to gain some insight into the date of the compositions and the context in which they were writ-ten. Table 1 shows a list of our authors and the works attributed to them. Since in some cases an author's influence upon an unanributed work may be inferred, authorship of almost half the texts in the collection can be firmly or loosely established (details arc supplied in the appendix). Establishing the dates of these authors is a thorny subject. I tentatively summarize the dates discussed here on the time chart (table 1). Various life histories survive, chiefly in Tibetan, although informed by a hagiographi-cal and sometimes sectarian agenda {Tatz 1987: 696). Among key sources on this subject is the famous L~~nJs of th~ Eighty-Fo11r Mahlisitldhas (G114bthob ~ rtsabz:hi'i lortJUS. hereafter Ugnu/s), which supplies accounts of the lives oflndrabhiiti, Lalqmiilkari, Liiyipada, Sahara, and the slighdy younger author Viriipa. 29 More information on their lineages, and episodes from their lives, can be gleaned from the Blw AnNlls (lnbth\" sNpnpo). written by 'Gos Lotsawa (Locchawa) b392-I,..S1), and the HisttJry ofBwJJhinn in Intiia by Taranatha (157s-?), but neither of these works can be relied upon for accurate dating. Scholars have often attempted to date authors according to the testimony of transmission lineages, a risky enter-prise that Kvaeme describes as \"methodological error\" (1977: 6). Illustra-tive of the problem is Dowman' s attempt to date the mahllsitJJhas using traditional Buddhist scholarship, according to which there arc no fewer than three kings of O#yana called lndrabhuti (1985: 131ffi c£ Dudjom 1991: 441, 458-59, 485-87): Indrabhiiti the Great, who may be as early as the seventh century (641 C. E. according to the Chinese rang Annals), an inter-mediate Indrabhiiri, possibly of the eighth century (although apparendy not recognized by Taranatha, Dowman ibiJ.: n.133), and Indrabhiiti the Younger, of the late ninth century. Davidson (1002.), however, comments"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"10 VAJRAYOGINi that even pinpointing three Indrabhutis is \"surely an underestimate\" and points to \"the tendency for traditional apologists and modern scholars to amalgamate the various personalities into one grand persona.\" Dowman (op. cit.) also puts forward three possible candidates for Indrabhiiti's sister, ~minkara, including a nun of similar name; however, even if we agree that this same ~minkara is the author of our Lalt!misadhana (GSS24), the only certainty we can have is that she was no later than the Tibetan translator of the text, who was known to have lived 1059-1109.30 Virupa, tra-ditionally the pupil of~minkara (Blw Annals: 390), is just as elusive, and may have lived as early as the eighth century (Taranatha History: 197) or as late as the eleventh century, when he supposedly taught Maitripada (also called Advayavajra) and Mar pa the translator (Blw Annals: 390). Similar problems beset the dating of the Mahasiddha Liiyipada. Kvaerne (1977: 5-6), for example, hesitantly cites Taranatha (History: 311), accord-ing to whom \"Lui\" was a contemporary of Maitri (Advayavajra) in the eleventh century, and notes that in one tradition, Liiyipada' s guru was Saraha, who may have flourished in the eleventh century or earlier (see also Dasgupta 1946: 6). Davidson (1991: n. 24) notes that Liiyipada's Sri-Bhagavadtzbhisamaya was translated into Tibetan in the first part of the eleventh century, \"apparently the earliest attested practice of the Cakrasaqtvara\" in the Tibetan canon. However, Sa skya legends assen that Liiyipada was a scribe at the coun of Dharmapala in the late eighth cen-tury (Dowman 1985: 37). The dating of Sahara is even more problematic. He appears as an early teacher in several genealogical traditions {Dowman ibid: 65; Kvaerne 1977: 6), but also as a teacher to later authors such as Vanaratna in the fifteenth century. Dowman therefore posits a line of teach-ers called Sahara, the only merit of which is that it echoes the legend of Sahara's immortality, according to which he would still be teaching today. Another of Sahara's pupils is said to be Advayavajra, whose dates have been discussed at length by Tatz (1987: 697) and shown to be tied to the reign of King Neyapala in the eleventh century (1007-85).31 Sahara also apparently initiated Vibhuticandra into the sixfold yoga system (sat!ttngayoga/1) (Blw Annals: 727). Stearns (1996: 127-71) places Vibhuticandra in the later twelfth to early thirteenth centuries at the time of the Moslem invasions. Vibhiiticandra would thus be the youngest author in our collection. Some of the younger contributors to the Guhyasamilyasadhanamtila are slightly easier to place because they admit their debt to earlier authors.

Fortunately, Umapatideva's lineage and dates are on slightly firmer ground, and these place him in the same generation as Sakyaralqita, perhaps as an older contemporary. The colophon to the Tibetan translation describes him as \"one who has the lineage of the instruc-tions ofViriipa, sri Umapatidatta\" (Tib 49.7), and the dates of the transla-tors link him fairly securely to the same period as Abhayakaragupta. The translators of U mapatideva' s two known texts in the bs Tan-gyur are VagiSvaragupta and Rwa Chos rab.14 Rwa Chos rab was active in India and Nepal in at least the first quarter of the twelfth century, and was a pupil of the Nepalese pat]cJ.it Samanta.Sri; Samanta.Sri himself flourished in the early to mid-twelfth century and received the Kalacakra teachings from Abhaya-karagupta (Biw Anntds: 76o--61; cf. ibid: 756, 789).1s Thus, the translation ofUmipatideva's works would seem to belong to the early to mid-twelfth century, and may even have been contemporary with the author. IfUma-patideva was of the same generation as Samanta.Sri (whom he is unlikely to have postdated, since his translator was a pupil of the latter), he may also have been a pupil of Abhayakaragupta 's. In the absence of much reliable evidence for dating the authors of the GuhyasamayastitlhaNlmtilii, we must look for other dues as to their origins. First, it seems that several authors in the Guhyasam4yastiJ111lmtilti are asso-ciated with the early dissemination of tantric lineages. Indrabhuti, for exam-ple, is traditionally known as \"the first llintrilta\" and was credited with initiating several tantric lineages, including the yogottara, Hevajra, and Cakrasatpvara traditions (Blw AnNlls: 869; Dudjom 1991: 485, 462; Dow-man 1985: 233; SM vol. 2: xxxi). Luyipada is particularly associated with the Cakrasarpvara system, on the basis of which he is traditionally known as the \"original guru\" (aJiguru) of the mahamudra (Dowman 1985: 37).

Sahara is also associated with the spread of mahamudra, according to the evidence of the Guhya-samayasadhanama/a (see chapter 2), and is an important transmitter of the ~aQaitgayoga discipline (Padma gar dbang, cited Stearns 1996: 140). One tradition putatively connects Sahara with the origins of the Trikaya-vajra-yogini tradition through his lineal descendant Krfl}icirya (Dowman 1985: 320; 7.19), although Benard (1994: 12-13) prefers to credit Lalqmirikara. In Tibet, Viriipa was regarded as the \"first lama or adiguru\" of the Sa skya sect (Dowman 1985: 52; Dudjom 1991: 853). The fact that the Guhyasamaya-Siil:lhanam4/a opens with two texts, one attributed to Indrabhiiti (or else-where to Sahara; sec GSS1 in the appendix) and an almost identical work to Liiyipada, is significant. It assens the antiquity of the collection, and hence its authenticity. Similarly, Indrabhuti's authorship implies that the geographical source of the teachings is 044iyana, the very homeland of esoteric spiritual revelation, as many tantric colophons testify.Jt» The text itself (GSS1-GSS2) reveals an East Indian influence, with its clear exchange of the consonants v for b in its mantroJJhtira. The fame of our later authors rests upon their scholarly transmission of the tantric teachings. The Blu~ Annals (pp. 841, 866, 976) refers to Advaya-vajra' s transmission of mahamudra, and associates him panicularly with compositions of the amanasilttira class (e.g., ibid: 842); it is in a text of this class, the *SidJha-Amnaya. that Advayavajra's quest for a vision ofVajra-yogini is described, and in which he is requested by his guru, Sahara, to return to academic life to commit his new understanding to writing.37 Advayavajra is one of the younger adepts who were working in the envi-ronment of the monastic universities in northeast India. These were cen-ters of Mahayana and tantric learning established under the Pala dynasties of Bihar and Bengal (76o-1142 c. E.), which flourished until their destruc-tion by the Moslem invaders between II97 and 1207 (Dun 1962: 380). The five outstanding foundations were: Vikrama.Sila, founded--according to Tibetan sources-under Dharmapala (77o-81o c.E.., ibid: 359); Odantapura and Somapura (also \"Somapuri') under Devapala (c. 81o-59 c.E., ibitl.: 373-74); Jagaddala in Varendra (nonh Bengal), which probably flourished under R.amapala (1on-n2o); and the oldest establishment, Nalanda, which had been sponsored at the end of Gupta rule by Ha~a (606-47 c.E.). Although less cultivated by Pala kings, Nalanda remained a prestigious seat of Mahayana philosophy, and at its peak, Chinese sources state that it catered"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi AND THE BUDDHIST TANTRAS 15 to several thousand students, offering as many as one hundred lectures, tutorials, or debates a day on topics both brahmanical and Buddhist (ibid.: 333; Misra 1998 1: 241ff.). Vikrama.Sila was the most renowned monastic universitiy in the Pala period, with Abhayakaragupta at its head, and its var-ious \"schools\" (sa1f2St/uib) conferring various posts, honors, and \"degrees,\" such as Jvarapa/4 (gatekeeper), pa'.\"Jita, or mahapa'.\"Jita (ibid.: 36cr63 fol-lowing Tibetan accounts). The reference to the academic milieu in the *Sit/Jha-AmNiya is inter-esting because it illustrates the contrast between the life of Advayavajra, the yogin-paJ}Qit working within the monastic universities, and the supposed source of his learning, the illiterate adept and mountain-dwelling huntsman Sahara. Although our younger authors may have lived and worked in the intellectually charged milieu of the monastic universities, their sadhana texts reflect the culture of the earliest proponents of the systems. They lay down prescriptions to practice in wild, solitary places void of people, and it is this aspect of their own practice that is most attractive to legend. In many accounts, historical narrative breaks into mythic motif precisely at the point when the monk rejects formal academia in favor of tantric yogic prac-tice. For example, the story of Advayavajra in the *SiJJha-Amnliya (p. u) first describes his formal training in grammar and orthodox (nontantric) Buddhist disciplines at monastic universities such as Vikramaftla; it then recounts his tantric studies (possibly under Nampa) at Nalanda, but only finally launches him on his higher tantric career when he leaves the monas-tic life and sets out on his magical journey to seek Vajrayogini, prompted by a voice in a dream. In Tibetan accounts, Advayavajra was expelled from the monastery for keeping liquor and a woman in his cell (Tatz 1987: 7oo-701). The same motif of expulsion is found in the account ofViriipa's life. According to the llgmJs (Dowman 1985: 43-52), this mahasiddha first became a monk of Somapura monastery, but despite his initiation into the practice of sow-faced Vajravarahi, he failed to see her even in a dream until, after twelve years, in a depressed state, he threw his rosary into the toilet. He attained mahamudri after another twelve years. Viriipa's subsequent expulsion from Somapura (for eating pigeon pie) was accompanied by var-ious miracles, such as walking on water and holding back the sun in a ploy to avoid settling his tab at the local tavern. The distinction between the two lifestyles-formal academic versus wan-dering yogic-may not have been so marked in practice. The wandering life was an integral part of the monastic experience. Practitioners would move between universities in pursuit of various teachers, and periods of retreat and"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"16 VAJRAYOGINi prior service (piirvasn~d) were also an essential part of formal training. The perceived dichotomy may have been a natural advenising ploy for the tech-niques to be espoused, and a crystallization of the ideal of the solitary tantric yogin. This is an ideal firmly embedded in the Indian traditions. The Bud-dha's going fonh is an imponant role model for any would-be Buddhist saint, and the inflation of this motif to actual expulsion from a monastery is one that provides a useful exegetical comment upon tantric praxis; it is precisely from their antinomian propensities that the practices of the high-est tantras draw their power. The texts themselves seem to envisage both lifestyles. At their most extreme, they advocate a type of yogic existence that transcends ritual observances, such as rites of the maJ]cJala, or obla-tions with mantras {see the first upaJ&J; in GSS32, appendix), but at the same time, they envisage a ritual specialist capable of performing numbers of such rites, not just for his own sake, but on behalf of others (see, for example, ch. 3 §39). In pursuit of either lifestyle, it seems it was not altogether necessary for the practitioner to be an ordained member of the Buddhist sangha. The higher tantric initiations (ch. 3), which include the empowerments for sex-ual praxis, were also open to householders. This is implicit in one of the erotico-yogic texts in the GuhyasamllJasdtihan4mdlli that refers to the \"[householder's] own house\" (svagrht) as one possible meditation site (GSS34, appendix). Umapatideva himself, author of the Vajravdrahi SI1Jhan4. may have been a layman, as well as an initiate into the lineage of Viriipa. His name means \"lord ofUma,\" that is, Siva, while ordination into Buddhist orders would ordinarily have endowed him with a Buddhist name. If he were a lay scholar, it would seem that Umapatideva still had access to the scriptural and exegetical sources available to those working in the monastic environment, judging by the extent of the redaction in the V ajravdrdhi SaJhana. This situation did not lie comfonably with some members of the monas-tic community, however. In her study of tantric antinomianism, Onians (2002: 292-93) comments that, \"The tension between tantric monks and householders must reflect a time when tantric practitioners were found both in and outside monasteries, and the Sangha was compelled to reassen its primacy .... \" Thus, the Kriyasamuccaya (f.3.2ff; Gellner 1992: 295) cites many tantric references to suppon the claim that a tantric teacher (vajracdryap) should be a monk, although the fact that it opens with a lengthy discussion on the maner raises the possibility of his not being so. Indeed, in his Vajrdcdryalaltfa'.'llvidhi, JagaddarpaJ}a states that a tantric"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi AND THE BUDDHIST TANTRAS 17 teacher may be of three types: monk, novice, or householder (following the S.'!'Wirlin;uzVIIItlntrll), but he asserts the superiority of the teacher who is ordained by adding that, should all three be found together, the house-holder should not be worshiped, for this would be disrespectfUl to the Three Jewels.)ll Another tantric exegete prescribes certain \"beginners\" rites and observances (li/Jj/tarma) for the householder practitioner (ghapatibotihi-sattva/1),39 suggesting, perhaps, that the qualifications of the lay practitioner were inferior to those of a monk. However, Isaacson (1999: personal com-munication) points out that the qualifications of the lay practitioner were not ncccssarily inferior to those of a monk, and that Jagaddarpal}a's open-ing discussion does not reveal his final position on the matter. Indeed, it may even have been the case that practitioners who had taken the bhi/tp4s1Uf11Hlra were sometimes forbidden or discouraged from the actual performance of transgressive practices. With their emphasis on solitary practice, the sadhanas themselves give no indication as to how they would be practiced within a monastic routine. This is particularly pertinent where the sidhana involves sexual practices that would infringe the monastic vow of celibacy (brahm4caryam). In tack-ling this issue, exegetes tended to argue that the tantric observances incor-porate and surpass, rather than negate or contradict, earlier vows of celibacy: .. \"[In taking tantric initiation] will he not then be guilty of aban-doning his earlier vows [of celibacy]? No, for each subsequent observance transcends the preceding, just as the lay devotee becomes a novice and the novice a monk. When a person has become a monk is there the absence of the vows he took as a lay devotee, etc.? [Of course not.],. J agaddarp~a (Onians op. cit.) actually redefines bralmuwtTJII. so that for a nontantric monk it still refers to celibacy; but for a monk who has taken highest ini-tiation (and whom he therefore understands to be spiritually superior), it refers to the retention of semen in the course of yogic sexual practices. How-ever, the attitudes of tantric authors on this matter are complex, as Onians makes clear (op. cit.: 168-71): AtiSa, for example, has-with justification-been interpreted as insisting that for those who hdd full monastic ordina-tion, the language of sexual yoga was open only to symbolic interpretation and was otherwise incompatible with monastic rule; and yet his conclu-sions are far more subde than this and clearly depend upon the context in which celibates may perform the higher initiations and upon a rigorous application of the qualifications that would permit a monk to bypass or transcend his monastic precepts-crucially, the degree of insight with which sexual praxis is imbued. Such sophisticated apologetics are a reflection of"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"18 VAJRAYOGINi the difficulty that must have arisen in bringing tantric practices within the monastic fold. Indeed, there are accounts of iconoclasm among Sthavira-vadins unable to tolerate deities such as Cakrasaqlvara at Vajrisana (Bodh-gaya), which Taranatha himself recorded (1990: 279): In a temple ofVajrisana there was then a large silver image of Heruka and many treatises on tantra. Some of the Sravaka Sen-dhavas [\"Siddhas\"] ofSinga island (Ceylon) and other places said that they were composed by Mara. So they burnt these and smashed the image into pieces and used the pieces as ordinary money. But on these issues, the new tantric orthodoxy was clear, as the hagiog-raphy of Abhayakaragupta testifies (B/w Annllls: 1046; Willson 2000: 397-98). Painting the picture of an exemplary abbot-scholar of traditional Buddhist hue, the lifestory of Abhayakaragupta describes his initial reluc-tance to embrace the new teachings, as he declines to welcome a woman into his monastic cell. When the woman turns out to be none other than Vajra-yogini in disguise, the monk sees the error of his ways, but finds that he has lost th~ opportunity ever to gain union with her in his lifetime. He is com-pensated with the promise that if he composed a \"great number of com-mentaries on profound tantras and many rites of maJ}Qalas,\" he would soon become \"a fortunate one\" -a challenge he appears to have accepted. Sadhana Colkctions Having examined the Indian milieu in which Umapatideva's Vajravarahi Sadhana was written, it is time to look more closely at the compilation of the GuhyasamayasaJhanam4la itself. According to the approximate daring of their authors, some texts in the collection are possibly as old as the ninth century, but perhaps only date from the eleventh century, while others are later still, dating from the twelfth century. The collection closes toward the end of the twelfth century with the work of an author who was probably a living contemporary, Vibhiiticandra (GSS43). Its upper date is fixed by the oldest surviving manuscript (K), which Sanderson (1995: personal com-munication) suggests is from the twelfth to thirteenth centuries. This date would be roughly contemporary with the earliest manuscript of another sadhana collection, the Slitihanalat4paiicllfilta, which dates from 1165 c.E. (Cambridge add. 1686). The GuhyasamayaW:/hanamaldreceives its title only"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi AND THE BUDDHIST TANTRAS 19 later; the name is found in the Devanagari manuscript (D) alone, in which the tide of the last work in the collection (I;Jaltini-guhyasamaya-Siidhanama/ii-tllntraraja) seems to serve as the basis for the collective tide Sri-Guhyasamaya-tllntra. The processes by which sadhanas were compiled into recognizable col-lections has been studied by Bi.ihnemann (I994), who suggests that schol-ars were engaged in collecting such works from the eleventh century on. Bi.ihnemann discusses four sadhana collections in all, basing her work on the four collections that Bu ston (I29<r-I364) drew into his catalog of the bs Tan nur (summarized in table 3):'41 I. The On~ Hundrtd and Fifty Sddhanas (*Sadhanalatapaficalik~ sGrub thabs brgya tlang lnga bcu), 42 consisting of about this num-ber of sadhanas. 2. The HunJrtd Sadhantzs (*StiJhanaiatalt4, sGrub thabs brgya rtsa), which contains about ninety-three sadhanas. 3· The Oc~an ofsadhanas ( *Siidhanasagara in Bu stan's catalog), also called the Colkction of Slidhanas ( Slidhanasamuccaya in the Peking edition P4221-4466), and the Garland of Sadhanas (saJhanaTNi/4 in the colophon of some Sanskrit manuscripts), consisting of a large collection of 242 sadhanas. 4· The *Dtvtintllravilvaslidhana collection, which appears in the Peking edition as an appendix to the second collection, the *Sadhanaiatllluz. It is from these collections that Bhattacharyya (I92SI28) produced his edition of the so-called Slidhanama/4, accidentally conflating the largest collection of 242 sadhanas (*StiJhanasagara) with the collection of ISO sadhanas (*Sddhanaiatllpafictiiiltd). 43 What does Bnhnemann 's survey of the sadhana collections reveal about the manner and date of their compilation? Bnhnemann shows that there are problems in fixing the contents of these collections since the Sanskrit man-uscripts do not agree between themselves, either in the sequence in which sadhanas appear or in the number of sadhanas they contain, and the Tibetan translations do not seem to accord with the Sanskrit \"originals.\" The com-pilation of substantial numbers of sadhanas, or the addition of other collec-"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"20 VAJRAYOGINi Table 3· Sddhana colkctions in tht bs Tan gyur 1. 150 sadhanas trans. c. uoo 2. 100 sadhanas trans. c. uoo Appmdixto Ptltint Edition SMlhaN17111i/4 Tantra Cambridge ms. add. !686 3· Ocean (or collection) of sadlww (SiitJJuuuu4gara, 0SilmuccllJII, •m4Jii) trans. c. n.86 S4Jha111l7Nil4 cd.

This may have encouraged closure, as in the case of the *Siitihanaiauzpaiicafilt4, which received its tide only once it had collected its one hundred and fifty works (ibid 1994= 11). Similarly, Biihnemann hints that Bu ston's third collection may have received its tide *StiJhtmastlgara in the later recensions preserved in Tibetan from its final portion of texts, entitled DtvanwasaJhanllSilgara (ibid 1994: 12). In some collections, the colophon to each individual sadhana also gives the collective tide, but again this prac-tice is not standard (ibid 1994: 11-12). Such irregularities in a tide's appear-ance in related recensions, and in the tide itself, suggest that collective tides were a later feature of the sadhana compilations. Their introduction (possi-bly coupled with efforts to \"round up\" the collections to grandiose figures that then serve as collective tides) gives the impression that the sadhana col-lection was emerging as a genre in its own right. The datings given by Biihnemann indicate that the earliest translations into Tibetan of whole col-lections were made in the later eleventh century and around the turn of the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINI AND THE BUDDHIST TANTRAS 21 twelfth century and continued into the thincenth century (and beyond), that is, in the period when the monastic universities under the Pala dynas-ties were at their height. Records of the Sanskrit manuscripts confirm this picture. Comparing the evidence of the manuscript collections with the dates of likely authors, it is dear that the time between the composition of a sadhana and its subsequent inclusion in a collection was often brief and that translation into Tibetan was also a rapid process. These conclusions confirm what has been gathered of the Guhyasll11UIJil-saJhanamlllll collection. There are, however, notable differences. The Guhytmzmayasadhanamti/4 is far smaller, containing only forty-six works. Moreover, it seems to have been rdatively stable. Only one sadhana (GSS8) is omitted in the later recension of the collection represented by the devanagan manuscript, a sidhana that is anyway repeated identically later in the collection (GSS39). The Guhyasa71U1J11Siilihanam4111 was not trans-lated into Tibetan, although some of its sadhanas appear in the bs Tan gyur as part of other collections (details are given in notes to the appendix). Remarkable is that all forty-six sadhanas of the Guhyastl11UlJASiklhanamti/4 focus upon VajrayoginiNajravarahi. Other sadhana collections, apart from being much larger, are more diverse. They include sadhanas relating to var-ious deities, sometimes arranged accordingly in groups inside the compila-tion. There are, for example, groups of sadhanas within the so-called Sdtlhanamti/11 that focus on other female deities (ch. 2), but not one of these has been preserved as a separate collection in its own right. The reason the GuhyllS41Nl]aslilihanam4111 remained a discrete collection and was not absorbed into another collection is unknown. Perhaps as a grouping it was too large to be placed inside another collection, or perhaps it had its own pretensions to reach a desirable \"fifty.\" Another suggestion is that this collection-with its single-minded concern with Vajrayogini and its \"contemporary\" nature-may have been the initiative of a single scholar. This impression is heightened by its internal organization. The col-lection begins with traditional-style ~c;lalas of the Cakrasarpvara tradi-tion adapted to the female deity Vajravarahi. There follows a gradual shift toward mal}~ exhibiting a more fully lttipaliltll character, a trend that is further developed in the \"skeleton arch\" (ltar/lnltlltOrll'.\"l) sadhanas, which reject the temple-palace structure of the ntal}c;lala altogether. Within this overall structure, the works seem to have been carefully, if approximately, grouped according to particular manifestations of Vajrayogini, and to the type of work in question. These groupings may be roughly broken down as follows, with some sadhanas appearing in this list more than once where"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"2.2. VAJRAYOGINi different groupings overlap (the various forms ofVajrayogini are discussed in chapter 2., and the sadhanas are described individually in the appendix): GSSI-GSS2 The first two sadhanas in the collection deal primarily with the hog-headed artlhaparyanlta-pose Vajravarahi, and are attributed to the pres-tigious figures lndrabhuti and Luyipada. GSS2, GSS3, GSS4, GSSs The next manifestation is of Vajravarahi in her classic warrior-stance form.

GSS3, GSS4, GSSs (GSSu, GSS16) The third sadhana (GSS3) is by another eminent figure, Advayavajra. It is the first in a group of essentially Cakrasarpvara-based works, all simi-lar in their exposition of the warrior-stance Vajravarahi within a maJ]4aJa based on the temple palace. All sadhanas in this group salute Vajravarahi in their opening reverence. Umapatideva's Vajravarllhi sadhaM (GSSn) is also of this type. An interesting sad.hana that belongs in part to the Advayavajra group and in part to the Sahara-related texts, is the sadhana of the thineenfold Vajra4akini Vajravarahi (GSS16).

The catalog of visual-izations supplied in the Abhisa1'111lyamafijari mirrors the sequence of the GuhyasamayastUJhanamlild collection as a whole, so that the classic warrior-stance Vajravarahi of the first pan of the work is followed by the iirJhvapliU-pose Vajrayogini, Vajragho!]i, the two-armed Vajrayogini, and the Trikayavajrayogini forms. Thus, it looks as if the Abhisamayamaiijari may have been used as a blueprint for the arrangement of sadhanas by the compiler of the Guhyasa11lll]llStiJhallllmt1la. TantricSadhanll The importance of the Guhyasa17UlJilStidhanamlilli collection to the Vajra-yogini tradition, and its uniqueness as a collection, have now been estab-lished. However, the decision to edit and translate the Vajravartihi StidhaM by Umapatideva (GSSu) still requires some explanation. Not only are there many sadhanas in the GubyasamayasliiJhNlTNi/d deserving of attention, but tantric literature in general is vast, and sidhana itself forms only one genre within it. What, then, is the significance of the sadhana within the tantras? And what is of panicular interest in Umapatidcva's Vajravlirllhi SiiJhaNl? A sadhana is a progressive sequence of meditative and ritual procedures that focus upon a particular deity or set of deities. It is a relatively late addi-tion to the tantric corpus. The first embryonic sadhanas appeared only in the eighth century with the yogatantras, and their form was still not stan-dardized by the time of the Hnajrlllllntra. Perhaps one of the earliest ref-erences to sidhana practices appears in the yogatantra scripture, the SArvadurgatipariJodhanlltantra, which recounts \"a sadhana taught by Sakyanatha· (p. 132 9b). The meditation is to be done \"with the method of generation\" (p. 130 Sa: utpattiltramn_ta), and it is described as \"the highest deity yoga\" (tkvatayoga'fl ... Ultamll'fl). Despite the inclusion of material not generally found in later sadhanas, it dearly sets out the key features of a mature sadhana, all of which will be seen as distinct stages in the Vajravartihi Sddhana (GSSu) studied here in chapter 3· Thus, it includes the usual"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINI AND THE BUDDHIST TANTRAS 25 preliminaries, the construction of a circle of protection, the accumulations of merit and wisdom, pujti, and the merging of the mal}4a}a in space with the~ in the bean. 44 The eighth-century commentator Buddhaguhya recognized the sadhana material in the Sarvllllurgatipariioelhttnatllntra as distina from the rest of the tantra, describing it as an \"introduction\" (glmg gzhi = nitlbut) to \"the aaual text\" (mJo bshllll) dealing with mai}Qalas (Sko-rupski 1983: xxvii). Another yogatantra commentator, Vilasavajra, also approaches the topic in his Nllmamantrllrthavaloltini. In adhikara IV, Vilisavajra produces his own proto-sadhana, which includes key prelimi-nary meditations and the generation of deities within a mal}4ala, but which lacks other established features of the later sadhana, such as developed stages of generating oneself as the deity, or the merging of the pledge and knowl-edge forms of deities (Tribe 199~ 1997: 115-17, 123-25). The eighth century also saw the emergence of the Guhyasamlljtttllntra (Gsn, and the beginnings of the exegetical schools based upon it. This tantra begins to systematize the components of deity practice. It distin-guishes a fourfold sequence of meditations as a prelude to ritual undenak-ings (e.g., GST ch. 12, vv. 6o-6s) that it refers to as: (1) service (sn~ll}; (2) auxiliary attainment (upasllJhanam}; (3) attainment (Wihanam}; and (4) great attainment (mahdsi1Jhanam).45 These cover introduaory and prelim-inary meditations (in the first and second stages), with the \"urging\" (cotlanam) and summoning of the deity, and its final visualization (in the third and founh stages). A related schema in the Guhyasamlljatllntrll, also in four stages, focuses just upon the generation of the deity. This is the \"[set of] four vajras\" (vajracatrqlttt), which corresponds in yoginitantra texts to the sequence of five awakenings. The Guhyasamajatllntra also distinguishes a stage of \"generation\" (utpatti), from a stage of \"completion\" (utpttnnal n;,p~~nna) (e.g., GST ch. 18, v. 84; see Wayman 1977: 23), an imponant classification that we will see in the mature sadhanas of the yoginitantra. The two stages or methods (ltrama[l), the generation stage (utpattiltrllwuzb) and the completion stage (utpllnnaltrllmll/J, niyJiln~). were elaborated upon in the two schools of Guhyasamija exegesis, each of which produced its own texts based on the classification. 46 The period of yogottara systematization took place in the ninth to tenth centuries in the setting of the great monastic universities (Mimaki and Tomabcchi 1994= ix), a period that coincided with the emergence of the new yoginitanttas. The highest tantra scriptures develop the deity meditations into sadhana-type practices that bear much the same form as the mature sadhana (e.g., Hn~ajrlltllntra, Mvlltipa!IJill 1.3 and Sll'!'VIlrotiiZJiltllntra."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINI irihm~ltoe/ayanirtidapafil/4 ch. 13). The four stages of the yogottara system (sn~d, etc.) are still current-both implicidy in a fourfold structure of the sadhana-type passages, and explicitly through direct reference (e.g., HTI.1.15; ADlJf ch. 14: 317fl).It is also notable that the internal structure of these tantras may demonstrate the same sequence of meditative and rit-ual events as those we will see in our study of a mature sadhana. The Sa'!'varodayatantra, for example, begins with the methods of generating the deity and his wider mai)Qala, followed by the ritual practices grounded in that self-generation.•' The structure of the Hn1ajrauzntra is similar and also mirrors the composition of a sadhana. •• The scriptural sources of the yoginitantras therefore draw closely on the methods of the sadhana, and may be seen as products of existing praxis that cultivated sadhana or sadhana-type techniques. Without an understanding of these stages within the sadhana practice, the intended meaning of the tantras is lost. At the same time, this period saw important developments in the form and structure of the sadhana itsel£ Such developments were doubdess stim-ulated by the new trends of the highest tantras and perhaps also reflected the need to clarify the practices outlined in the scriptures. Thus, features of the sadhana already evid~nt in th~ yogatantra corpus underwent gradual defini-tion. The process is detectable in certain sets of sadhanas in the Sdt/hanamd/4 collection, such as the sizable collections of sadhanas grouped around man-ifestations of Avalokitdvara (SM6 to SM41) and Mafijwri (SM-44 to SM84}. Here one sees how the peaceful cults of princely cakravartin-style bod-hisattvas are increasingly permeated by tantric elements, such as the preem-inence of the guru, the use of transgressive substances, erotic and wrathful Saiva-based iconography, erotica-yogic praxis, and cremation-ground motifs. The method of generating the deity is also refined, and evolves into the series of five awakenings found in the mature sadhanas, to be followed by the merging of its pledge and knowledge forms. By the time of the yoginitantra sadhanas of the GuhyasamayastiJha111lmal4, the form of the tantric sadhana was well established, and yet our study of the collection will reveal that the genre was still developing. In response to developments in the yoginitantra scriptures, some sadhanas will be seen to introduce cremation-ground (ltdplili/ta) features within the standard format of the sadhana, and others to reject mainstream formats altogether. The sadhana is significant within tantric literature as a whole in that it mirrors and clarifies developments in content and method. As a genre it is particularly flexible, because its form may be easily adapted to cater to changing currents and trends in praxis. In this way, the sadhana is able to"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINI AND THE BUDDHIST TANTRAS 27 elaborate and develop tantric practices that are lacking or marginal in the scriptural material itsd£ This is particularly pertinent in the cult ofVajra-yoginiNajravarahi, which has no scriptural corpus of its own, but borrows from the scriptural tradition of Cakrasarpvara. One reason U mapatideva' s Vajravariihi Sitiha111l is a useful subject for analysis is that it highlights the processes of redaction by which new tantric techniques were adapted from existing ones-that is, how the author borrows from scriptural and exeget-ical sources concerning the Cakrasarpvara ma~c;lala and its rituals, and alters them to describe the Vajravarahi ma~4ala and its rituals. Since sadhanas are not tied to a particular scriptural source, we will see that dif-ferent works in the Guhyasamayastidha1Ulmtilti draw on different parts of the Buddhist (and Saiva) traditions and produce a range of forms and prac-tices of Vajrayogini. Above all, sadhanas are manuals of practice; they are the \"means of attainment\" (sadha111lm) whereby the goals of the highest tantras may be realized. Their prescriptions encompass a range of meditation techniques and ritual procedures, the length and complexity of which suggest a full-time commitment to the practices. As shown earlier, little in the sadhana suggests the practitioner's broader lifestyle. His daily routine is indicated only by general injunctions that are embedded into the sadhana itself, namely, to rise early, to wash, to perform the sadhana in a solitary place pre-ceded by certain preliminary rites, to repeat it three or four times a day, and to perform various external rites on the basis of this meditation. Sadhana texts also say litde of the previous spiritual practice that has prepared the practitioner for taking up the sadhana or of the initiations that have qual-ified him to do so. Such preliminaries are so fundamental to the tantric sys-tem that they are usually taken for granted by the author of a sadhana, whose audience is understood to be made up exclusively of initiates into the cult. As one sadhana in the Guhyasa11lllJIISiltlha1Ul7'Nila puts it, the prac-titioner should be someone \"who has an undivided attitude of devotion toward his teacher and the Buddha, who has firmly seized the will to enlightenment, [and] who has correctly obtained initiation. \"49 The topic of initiation or consecration is a vast and complex one; it is discussed briefly in our study of the sadhana at the point when the meditator visualizes his own consecration by celestial deities, a process that mirrors the types of consecrations employed by tantric teachers in their initiatory empower-ment of pupils. It is only after such inititations have taken place that cer-tain practices may be undertaken, indeed, that the Slilihalta becomes obliged to fulfil his vows to practice."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi The role of the guru in this process is, of course, central. It is upon his authority alone that the tantric systems depend. It is the teacher who trans-mits teachings, authorizes praxis, and performs the initiations that qualify pupils to identify themselves with their chosen deity in the practice of deity yoga. The importance of understanding the guru to \"be\" the Buddha (that is, the central deity of the particular tantric cult), the benefits of worship-ing him, and the evils of transgressing his instructions, are therefore favorite themes in tantric literature and often appear in frame verses to sadhana texts, for example:~ The guru is the Buddha, the guru is the Dharma, and the guru is the Sangha. The guru is the glorious Vajradhara; in this life only the guru is the means [to awakening]. Therefore, someone wishing to attain the state ofbuddhahood should please the guru. The post-initiatory observances are known as the observances of the pledge or samaya (sam4Jiictlrab)Y Their supreme importance to the newly conse-crated yogin is often emphasized by the texts with the insistence that the samaya be \"protected.\" The yogin does this by practicing it faithfully, and by maintaining a strict code of secrecy. Reminders that the practices are secret (guhya) and solemn injunctions to secrecy are therefore common, especially when the texts invert traditional ethical norms by prescribing transgressive disciplines, such as sexual yoga. This leads us back to the cen-trality of the guru, who is the source of teachings that may well remain purely oral. The first sadhana in the GuhyasamayasaJhanamala is itself described as the \"Oral Teaching ofVajrayogini\" (Vajrayoginimulthagama), and its secret practices are said to go from \"ear to ear, mouth to mouth.\" The sadhana includes a description of a parvapiijti in which the yogin is to worship a young virgin and, while naked, make transgressive offerings of sexual fluids to the deity; it then enjoins secrecy, and reminds the yogin that if he wants to obtain siddhi, he must preserve the samaya. In a Vajragho~a plija (GSS18), midnight offerings include incense made of powdered human flesh, following which the text states that \"this is not to be told to any-one. \"~2 Secrecy preserved and enhanced the efficacy of the teachings, and was understood to be the crucial context for their practice, the essential ingredient that gave the antinomian cults of esoteric Buddhism their power. It was (and still is) of crucial importance to the practices of Vajra-yoginiN ajravarahi, who is described in one text as \"mother of the guhyaltas [lit: 'those with secrets,' i.e., initiates)\" (n. 75)."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINI AND THE BUDDHIST TANTRAS 29 Following his initiation into a sadhana practice, the pupil would next undertake a prolonged period of mantra recitation, which forms a prepara-tory foundation for undcnaking the sadhana itsd£ This is referred to as \"prior service\" (purwun~a). Without this bedrock it is said that the sadhaka \"would stun, damage, and harm himself' (mKhas grub rjc: 2.75-79). The number of mantra recitations required varies according to different sys-tems. For example, in the Hcvajra system (HTI.10.25ab) there are to be one hundred thousand for the lord of the IIW}Qaia and ten thousand for the maJ}Qala retinue; similar numbers arc given in the Vajravali for the Kalacakra texts, while in the Sarpvara system, there arc said to be both medium and brief periods of service (mKhas grub rje ibiJ.).~1 Since authors of sidhanas say little about the preparation and training undergone by a sadhaka prior to his undertaking the practice, they assume that he has already acquired the necessary meditative, ritual, and con-ceptual skills. This most important meditative tool is the technique of visualization meditation. This demands that the practitioner be able to visualize the object of meditation, located either in space in front of him or at the center of his own body. Texts state that he should \"see\" (p*t, avalokaytt, ik!tta) the object of meditation \"very clearly\" (GSSn v.17: vispfl!.tlltllram) and unwaveringly (SM123: 254); he should \"contemplate\" (vi-cintaytt), \"imagine\" (vi-bhavaytt), \"meditate upon\" (e/hyiyat), or \"be convinced or ( adhimulictt) it. The manner of producing the visualized object in the mind is described as the arising or generation (utpattip) of the object and usually begins with a mantra syllable representing the essence or source of the object to be visualized. This is known as its seed (bijam) or seed-syllable (bijalqaram), and it has both an aural dimension, such as the sound of the mantra syllable hii'f', and a visual dimension as the written form of that syllable, f , seen with the mind. The seed-syllable then undergoes an imaginative transformation into the object for which it is the more essential symbol, which is expressed in Sanskrit as the object being \"produced\" or \"born\" (-ja. -bhuta. -nqpanna), or-where there is a whole sequence of such visualizations-by their \"evolution,\" \"develop-ment,\" or \"transformation\" (pariruJmnut) into the final object.S4 The visu-alized forms arc understood to be made of light; they are vibrant, incandescent, pellucid, and yet as insubstantial as any other simile for emptiness. They scintillate with the emission and retraction of light rays that function as powerful agents of the meditation, acting to remove igno-rance and impurities, destroy obstacles, give succor to beings, or praise or coerce deities. ss"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"30 VA J RAY 0 GIN i The locus of the visualization is significant because it differs according to different rites, and plays an important pan in the classification of the sadhana. The deity may be visualized \"in space\" (lthaJhatau) in front of the meditator, as in the preliminary puja, or be generated within an exter-nal ritual object, such as a maJ]4ala diagram drawn upon the ground or upon the meditator's own hand. The process of generating objects of med-itation is at its most elaborate in the section that deals with the yogin's gen-eration of himself as the deity. Here the generation is located at the center of the yogin's own body, inducing in him the conviction that he \"is\" the deity. The sadhana is therefore a \"means of attainment\" because it is a tool for the transformation of the mundane into the the transcendental. The application of the self-generation method at this stage generally clas-sifies the sadhana as a generation-stage practice (utpattiltra1'Nll}, see ch. 3). In a self-generation sadhana, the subject of prescription changes in mid-course. The mundane personage of the practitioner who begins the prac-tice is designated variously as the sadhaka, the yogin, the mantrin (literally, \"the possessor of mantra\"), or by some traditional laudatory epithet acknowledging that he is \"a skilful one\" (vica/qa'.'fl!J), wise (butihab), or learned in mantric lore (mAntravit). In the course of the self-generation, the meditator acquires the transcendental identity of the chosen deity. The new agent is described as \"one conjoined with the deity\" (tkvattiyuktavan), the practitioner of\"deityyoga\" (ekwztdyoga[1). He is the \"yogin-as-deity\" or, as in the context of our Vajravarahi visualization, the \"yogin-as-goddess.\" Another means of transforming a mundane object into a transcendental one is by symbolically equating one with the other. This is termed, literally, a \"purification\" (viiutblhii,J). The correspondence is made on the firm under-standing or conviction (adhimolqa[1, niicltJab) of the mundane object \"as\" the supramundane counterpan. The yogin understands that the true essence or inherent nature (svabhavab) of the mundane element is ontologically equivalent to that of the supramundane, because both are empty (iiinya). The mundane is \"purified\" through the practitioner's realization that emptiness pervades both sides of the equation. For example, a practice well attested in yogottara and yoginitantra sources is the purification of the yogin's entire pyschophysical being as a preliminary to undertaking the sadhana. Here, each of his five sltantihas, his sense organs and the five elements in the body, are correlated imaginatively with a particular buddha, bodhi-sattva, or buddha-conson. The viiuddhi is more than a means of imbuing an object with a symbolic value to an object, although a complex web of symbolic relationships may be implied, connecting together different levels"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi AND THE BUDDHIST TANTRAS 31 of reality. It is rather a \"purifying correspondence\" that associates the mun-dane with the supramundane on the basis of emptiness, and thereby purifies the former. As Sferra (1999) notes, in his discussion of the topic, the term viiuJJhi indicates on one hand \"pureness,\" Buddha nature itself, \"the ever shining and pure condition that is always present in all things .... On the other hand, the term indicates purification and therefore a process or a means.\" In addition to the sadhaka's skill in visualization and meditation tech-niques, he is expected to be a ritual specialist. T antric ritual in general revolves around the methods of the sadhana, which provide the means and the rationale for rites, both on private and public levels. In the sphere of private practice, rituals of worship and propitiation are generally prescribed following the main body of the sadhana, and we will see how, according to the highest tantric systems, they can be undertaken only on the basis of deity yoga. The transformation of the sadhaka into the deity during the course of the sadhana is therefore the necessary preliminary to all other rit-ual acts whatsoever, and it is really the transcendental deity itself-in this case, Vajrayogini-who performs the rituals, and not the (unenlightened) practitioner. In the public arena, the transformative tools of sadhana med-itation are just as crucial. For example, rites of consecration (prafi!tha) play a key part in communal practice, as all objects for religious use must be consecrated, from buildings such as monasteries and stiipas, to objects such as statues of deities, painted images, the doth on which those images are drawn, religious texts and manuals, initiation vases, ritual implements, and so on. In order to undertake the rites of consecration, the tantric offi-ciant must first have generated himself as the deity by means of the sadhana, and then, in his transcendental persona, must set about trans-forming the mundane object into a receptacle for the deity to enter, recre-ating it as the locus in which the deity becomes present and established (prafi!thita). In this process, the tools of sadhana meditation are employed to generate the form of the deity within the object, to infuse it with supra-mundane wisdom, and then to initiate it according to the tantric system of initiations. In her detailed study of the consecration of images and stiipas in tantric Buddhism, Ben tor traces the elements of these complex public rites, and shows how they are in themselves a \"special application\" of the \"basic transformative ritual\" that is the sadhana (1996: especially 1-13; Tanemura 2002). The transformative influence of the sadhana is intended to permeate the sadhaka s entire life. Rites are sometimes distinguished according to whether"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"32 VAJRAYOGINi they arc \"outer\" (*bahyaltriyli) or \"inner\" (adhytitmayoga/1) (e.g., mKhas grub rje: 219), and it is clear that the different elements of the sadhana cover both planes. On an outer level, sadhana prescriptions govern bodily actions and speech, as when the yogin performs his morning ablutions or prepares a suitable site for the meditation through mantra recitation. On an inter-nal level, we have seen how mental, imaginal, and experiential faculties all come into play in visualization meditation to create the conviction of new transcendental reality. But the rites and meditations of the sadhana cannot really be so clearly divided. External ritual actions also play an important part in the yogin's internal world, as the visualization meditations them-selves also include bodily movements such as hand gesture (mudrti), verbal utterance (mantra/J), or the complex mental activity of preparing and visu-alizing offerings to deities. In some meditations, the inner world the yogin has conjured up in the course of the sadhana is itself treated as if it were an \"external\" object and subjected to meditative practices that seek to inter-nalize it even further, integrating it within his experience on less and less conceptual levels. Note, for example, the increasingly subtle meditations prescribed within the context of yogic meditations, practices such as the contemplation of iconic and aniconic forms of deities and .. drops\" that arc perceived within the yogin's own \"veins\" (nlitjis) and \"body centers\" (cakrAS) (ch. 3). Looked at another way, the internal world that is created through the practice of deity yoga must also be externalized and made to imbue all the yogin • s outer actions in his daily life. This happens at the end of the sadhana, when the sadhaka is instructed to keep the internal convictions produced through his visualization meditation and to maintain an awareness of himself with the form and nature ofVajravarahi while he goes about his everyday business. In this way, his whole life becomes a meditative ritual. The inner and outer levels are thoroughly interwoven and interconnected, and come together to forge the practitioner's conviction that he is the deity on all levels of his being: on the external planes of his bodily and verbal action, on the internal planes of thought process and existential conviction, and on the subtle experiential dimensions beyond conceptualization. The method is thus perfectly allied to the goal of unification with the deity, or \"deity yoga.\" The same methodology is reflected in the structure of the sadhana. It begins with a series of preparations that allow the sadhaka to assimilate himself to the outer and inner character of his chosen deity, and intensifies as he imagines himself reborn as Vajravarahi and infused with her wisdom. Since the sadhana is to be performed at least once daily, it results in a"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi AND THE BUDDHIST TANTRAS 33 spiraling circularity. It establishes and reestablishes the yogin in a form that he already believes himself to possess. The significance of the sadhana within tantric literature therefore lies in the fact that it is the basic tool of all tantric praxis; it supplies the means with which the practitioner is to recreate ordinary reality as transcendental reality, and thus to achieve h~r her-ultimate aim."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"2. The Cult of Vajrayogini in India THE sAD HANAS of the Guhyasa1NIJilSiklhana1Nilli present a rich and varied picture of the Vajrayogini cult in India between the tenth and twelfth centuries. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at the tantric practices that underpin the cult, focusing first on the influence of nondual Saivism. We then turn to the emergence ofVajrayogini within the broader context of other female deity cults, and also of Vajraririhi, who comes to be seen as one of Vajrayogini' s chief manifestations. The rest of the chapter is really a survey of the forms ofVajrayogini that appear in the GuhyasamAyastilihanamd/4 collection. These are gleaned from the sections in the sadhanas that deal with the generation~r more usually, self-generarion~f the deity and describe her iconographical form and the set-ting in which she is to be visualized. Of the forty-six works extant in the collection, thirty-seven prescribe a visualization, or in some cases, several visualizations of the goddess, and so overall we find about fifty separate iconographical descriptions. In this way, drawing from the Guhyasamaya-saJhanamd/4 alone, we find almost twenty distinct forms of Vajrayogini. Although the sadhanas of the GuhyASa1NIJilSiklhanam4/4 undoubtedly include the main forms of the goddess, variations were constanly emerging as the cult devdoped. A full survey of all of these would entail not just wider investigation of Sanskrit sources than I have managed, but a study of both written and artistic sources for the cult in Nepal, Tibet, and Mongolia; there are also the fascinating but largdy unplumbed riches of the T angut empire, which developed a strong Buddhist identity during its two-hundred-and-fifty-year existence (982-1229) at a rime contemporary with the cult of Vajrayogini in India. Among their conquests the T anguts counted the city ofKhara Khoto (c. 1030), from which many fine tangkas remain (e.g., plates 2, 3, and n). 35"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINI Within the GuhyasamAyastiJhanamlila, we find that the commonest sub-ject is the red, two-armed warrior-stance Vajravarahi (fig. 17).~ It is this form that is the focus of U mapatideva' s Vajravartihi SaJhana, and in our study of that sadhana in chapter 3, we explore in depth the visualizations and meditations associated with her and her maQQala, and the various mantras and rites prescribed for her practice. In the survey of the forms and manifestations that follows, we find that Vajravarahi even assumes some-thing of the generic status ofVajrayogini, as she herself takes on a number of different forms. However, the different forms of the goddess are also quite distinct in a number of ways. Although I distinguish them here on the grounds of iconographical differences, a truer method of differentiat-ing the forms would be on the basis of the different mantras (often based on the Vajrayogini root mantra), which-following Saiva models-authors took great care to preserve. Following the iconographical descriptions of each form, I therefore give a brief account of the associated mantras and rit-uals; this also mirrors the structure of the sadhanas themselves. Where possible, I have tried to find artistic representations to illustrate the various forms of the deity. In the case of some sadhanas, it has been pos-sible to draw on a set of wooden block prints that were commissioned in Mongolia in 1810 in connection with an empowerment ceremony given by the fourth Panchen Lama, bsTan pa'i nyi rna phyogs las rnam rgyal (1781-1854) (Tachikawa et al. 1995: 7; Willson and Brauen 1000: xvii). The textual basis for the Mongolian icons of Vajrayogini is a compilation of sadhanas that the fourth Panchen Lama produced especially for the empow-erment ritual, known in brief as the Rin /han. The basis for the Rin /han is a cycle of over three hundred Tibetan sadhanas compiled in the early sev-enteenth century by Taranatha (1575-1634), and commonly known as the Rin 'byung brgya rtsa. Taranatha himself was drawing on translations of Sanskrit sadhanas that reach back to the time of the Guhyastzmayasa4ha111l-ma/.ti; indeed some of the forms of Vajrayogini in our collection are also described in the Tibetan texts of the Rin /han, the fourth chapter of which is devoted to this deity. ~7 The woodblocks were produced from the textual descriptions of the Rin /han. The set consists of over five hundred miniature images of deities with their mantras, for use during initiations or as an aid to visualization. They have now been published at least three times, in different forms, and under different tides:58 (1) as a set of prints from original woodblocks (Tachikawa et al. 1995); (1) as set of line drawings based on the woodblock prints, but"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINIIN INDIA 37 altered in some standard details; commissioned by Lokesh Chandra, and appearing in his various publications as pan of the so-called \"Nanhang Pan-theon\" (between 1959 and 1988);s' and (3) as a set of color prints, perhaps dat-ing to around 1850, shown to have been carefully painted to the drawings of the woodblocks, and somewhat embellished (Willson and Brauen 2000). To illustrate forms of Vajrayogini from the Guhyasllmll]llStkihll111lm411i. I draw on the set of woodblock prints commissioned by Lokesh Chandra. I am also able to reproduce in color the painted versions of several Mon-golian icons in plate 10. Where no Mongolian icon is available (and where I have found no other artistic source), I have commissioned an original line drawing in a similar style by a contemporary English Buddhist artist, Dharmacari Aloka. His line-drawings are careful conjectural reconstruc-tions drawn according to the Sanskrit text, which we have conceived as an aid to the reader in imagining the forms of the deity described but with no claim to \"authenticity\" beyond that. Indeed, the Mongolian icons them-selves are late Tibetan reconstructions in the style of their time and shed no light upon how these forms may have been conceived originally by the Indian authors of our texts. Tht lnjlumct of Nondua/ Saivism A formative influence upon the Vajrayogini cult was that of nondual Saivism. Pioneering research in this area by Sanderson (1993, 1994b, 1995, 2001b) has shown the highest Buddhist tantras to be startlingly rdiant upon nondual Saiva sources; so much so that it amounts to no less than what he calls \"pious plagiarism\" (1995). Sanderson (2oorb) estimates that in the root text of the Cakrasarpvara tradition, the Lllghrdtnrzvllratllntrll, \"long passages, amounting to some two hundred verses, nearly a third of the whole, can be seen to have been redacted from Saiva originals,\" which--since this part of the Saiva canon is itself only partly preserved-must indicate an impressive debt. The Saiva cults that leave their imprint most strongly upon the higher and highest Buddhist tantras are those belonging to the mantrapi!ha or \"seat of mantras,\" and the vitiydp~tluz or \"seat of vidyas,\" both of which arc divisions within that stream of Saiva dispensation termed the mantrllmtirgll. or \"path of mantras\" (Sanderson 1988: 668ff.).60 Worship within the m~~ntrapithll was of a type of Siva called a \"bhairava\" (\"terrible\"), a wrath-ful, cremation-ground form of the god in union with an equally terrible"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi consort, such as Svacchandabhairava (or Aghora) and his consort, Aghore-5vari. The cremation-ground elements are even more in evidence in the Vidyipitha, where they relate principally to esoteric cults based upon fem-inine power (laktif.J) such as those of the Trika and the Krama. The Trika focuses on three goddesses, Para, Apara, and Parapara, who have subordi-nate consorts in bhairava forms and retinues of male and female deities. The Krama cults manifest fierce forms of the goddess Kali In one of the highest forms of nondual Saivism, the goddess is worshiped within a ~4ala of twelve identical Kalis; she appears alone without any consort, indeed, stamping upon the corpse of Bhairava, or wearing parts of his dis-membered body for her ornaments (ibitl.: 674-75).61 The Vidyipitha per-ceived itself as related but superior to the mantrapitha, just as the Buddhist yoginitantras perceived themselves as related but superior to the yogottara-tantras. It is from the Vidyipitha tradition that the yoginitantras drew most heavily. Sanderson has pointed to a number of ways in which the Buddhist tantra is indebted to the Saiva tradition (1988: 678-79; 1994b; 1995; 2001b), and what follows is a brief summary of his findings with just a few exam-ples. First, the Buddhist tantra borrows on the textual level. One way it does this is to draw on Saiva scriptural tides, with litde or no adaptation to the new Buddhist context. For example, the Buddhist title Yogini-sa,caratantra points directly to the Saiva chapter tide Yoginisa1J1Cilra (in the Kali-ccntered jayaJrathayamalatantra). Another Buddhist tantra title, SarvabuJJhasamliyogiUja/tiT}ijlllasa1J1vara, is closely influenced by the titles of two Saiva works, the Sarvavirasamayoga and the YoginijaWa,vara, while the Buddhist HnJajratjakinijalasa,.vara again draws on the Saiva tide Yoginijalala'!'vara. As well as relying on Saiva nomenclature, great portions of text are drawn wholesale from Saiva sources. For example, Sanderson (ibitl., espe-cially 2001b) has shown that the root Cakrasaqtvara scripture draws directly on Saiva sources in the chapter teaching how to identify and distinguish members of the various families; thus the LaghulaTf'varatllntra (ch. 19) describes the characteristics of a class of yoginis known as \"lamas\" by draw-ing directly on the Saiva SU/dhayogdvarimata (ch. 29), and on the same theme the root text (chs. 15-17) draws directly from the third ~!ka of the ]ayaJrathayamalatantra ( Yoginisa,cara section, the Samayacaract!!ll-vidhana pa!fl/a, vv. 116-48); it also incorporates portions from Trika texts such as the Niiisa1J1Cilra and the Tantrasatibhava. The so-called explana-tory tantra to the root text, the Abhidhanottaratantra (ch. 43), has drawn"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGJNi IN INDIA 39 directly on the Picumtlta-Brahmayamallltantra (ch. 85) for the rules (sanuzyas) that bind initiates; the Sa'!'varodayat4ntra (ch. 15) draws also upon the Picumtltll ( ch. 4) for the classification of skull bowls. As one may expect from such a heavy reliance upon the Saiva texts, apart from the stUnning number of parallel verses, there is also a high degree of overlap in stylistic convention and stereotypical expression, such as the common introduction: \"Next I will explain ... \" (athlitllb Sll'!'prava/qytimi ... ). In these ways, the Saiva texts serve not just to provide concrete materials on vari-ous topics, but become structural models for the new Buddhist composi-tions. This affected even the most unique element of any tantric practice, the mantra, which may not only be written down according to Saiva con-ventions for preserving mantras intact, but are themselves in the style of the Saiva vidyapiPta (ibiJ. 2.001b: n. 52.). A dear example of Buddhist recy-cling and adaptation of a Saiva mantra is found in the Guhyavajravi/asini-SillihaNl (GSSxo) discussed below. Second, the Buddhist tantras have taken their wrathful and erotic ori-entation from Saiva praxis. The terrifying, cremation-ground character of the higher Buddhist tantras has its roots in Saiva mythology. According to the myth (described variously in the PuriQas), the original skull observance (luipllillvratam), or \"great observance\" (mllhavratam), was the result of a quarrel between Brahma and the Vedic form of Siva, Rudra. When Rudra ends the matter by plucking off Brahma\" s head, he finds he has commited the heinous crime of slaying a brahmin (brahmllhatyd). He is then forced to undergo a period of extreme penance in which he lives in exile from soci-ety, dwells in cremation grounds (sites of the greatest impurity), smears himself with ashes of the dead, and begs for food using a bowl made of a human skull. Orthodox DharmaSastra (as mirrored by the myth) states that brahmin-slayers can only expiate their offence through a period of twelve years in exile, by inhabiting cremation grounds and by carrying a skull bowl (lulpti/am)and skull staff (ltha!Jidnga/1)when begging food. Manu, for exam-ple, states that \"A priest-killer should build a hut in the forest and live there for twelve years to purify himself, eating food that he has begged for and using the skull of a corpse as his flag\" (11.73, trans. Donigcr 1991). The mythical role model of the penance of Rudra became the direct inspiration for early ascetic cults in the atimd1f4 (\"outer path\") stream ofSaivism, such as the Pasupatas (dating from the second century) and in particular their more extreme offshoot, the Ukulas (Sanderson 1988: 664-66). I...akula as-cetics adopted the outer appearance and behavior of Rudra as part of a pro-gressive series of practices aimed at complete immersion in the god. Skull"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi observances were also adopted by ascetics in the mantramarga stream of Saivism, who moved away from the liberationist goals of the atimarga, choosing instead to aim for the acquisition of supernatural power (bhogaf,l). They wore bone ornaments and carried the skull staff of ltaptililta obser-vance, but modeled themselves instead upon terrifying cremation-ground ectypes of Siva, whom they worshiped with impure substances such as alco-hol, blood, and sexual Auids obtained from intercourse with a consort in orgiastic rites (ibid: 667-71). The Buddhist initiate into the esoteric cults of the yoginitantras likewise performed a skull observance, known as the \"vow of the observance of heroes\" (viracaryavrata). or the vajra (i.e., \"Vajrayanist\") skull observance (vajraltapalilttuarydvratam).62 As in the Saiva tradition, this was based on the practitioner's inner identification with his chosen deity and involved wor-ship of the god with impure substances. In Abhayakaragupta's description of the \"vajra skull observance\" (Sanderson 1994b: 91, 98 n. 2.), the male practitioner wears the attributes of the Buddhist deity Cakrasarpvara. He adorns himself with a garland of skulls, a tiger skin as lower garment, a brahmanical thread made of sinews or human hair, a headdress, a garland, a vajra, armlets, anklets, and little bells, and he visualizes his consort as Vajravarahi. While the Buddhist observance, like the Saiva counterpart, also brings the promise of supernatural attainment (sitJJhi~). the goal is ultimately that of enlightenment. Another feature of the Vajrayogini cult that owes its origin to non-dualistic Saiva developments is its emphasis on the worship of female deities. In the vidyapi!ha traditions of Saivism, the cremation-ground cults center on families of\"mothers\" (seep. 43): classes of wild yoginis who drink blood, wear skull ornaments, and arc enticed by impure offerings of bodily and sex-ual excretions (Sanderson 1988: 67off.). In this context, the central god-desses of the T rika rise above their male consorts in status to become the chief deities of the m~Qala, while esoteric forms of Kili emerge entirely from the embrace of their consorts. As a sign of her supremacy, Kili sub-jugates her former consort by trampling him underfoot. We will see Vajra-yogini and Vajravarahi rise above the male forms in the same way in the Buddhist tradition, and with the same iconographical symbolism. Within the highest Buddhist tantras, however, the iconographical borrowings take an unexpected tum, as it is not the deities of outmoded Buddhist systems that are trodden down, but the Saiva gods themselves. Thus, while the motif of subjugation is another example of the Buddhist reliance upon Saiva norms, it dearly expresses the Buddhist superiority over those norms."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINIIN INDIA Transgressive Discipline ( vamacarab) As in the esoteric Saiva systems, JuipaJilta and sexual practices in the Bud-dhist tantras arc grounded upon a metaphysics of nonduality. Its purpose is to counter the ordinary, conventional dualism of the mind that naturally perceives aspects of the world as either \"pure\" or \"impure.\" By shattering these instinctive responses, lulplililtll practices radically challenge the unen-lightened dualistic tendencies of the mind, attacking the innate dichotomy of subject and object and forcing it to break through to the experience of a nondual reality. In both nondual systems, the underlying method is that of\"transgrcssive discipline\" or \"conduct of the left\" (vlimlkdrfl/1). The \"left\" (vtitnll) in vtimaclirll refers to the left hand, which in Indian society is reserved for impure bodily functions and signifies impurity. The rites of the highest tantras, however, specifically prescribe the use of the left hand. This forms a powerful contradiction of cultural norms that rely on the use of the right hand to maintain purity. Use of the left hand, especially within a ritual context, was &om an orthodox standpoint, nothing short of socioreligious iconoclasm. Because orthodox brahmanical society relied upon the strictest preservation of purity, transgressive discipline set out to undermine sanctified distinctions between pure and impure wherever pos-sible, embracing deeply felt taboos and relishing contact with sources of the greatest impurity. Thus, by taking place in cremation grounds, and requiring ornaments of hWIWl bone, lttipdlilt4 observances place the prac-titioner in contact with that gravest source of impurity: death. Many high-est tantric rites also involve the use of impure substances such as alcohol and bodily fluids, either for drinking or for washing. Sexual regulations, tradi-tionally essential to the preservation of class and caste structures, are also ovenumed. Texts that prescribe sexual yogic practices often recommend the usc of consorts &om the most taboo groups such as close relatives, or untouchable and contaminated classes--a fact reflected in the names of goddess consorts such as Sttr~!'#ni. a female &om the liquor-selling caste (GSSn v. 51i). The ideal consort is erotically provocative. Abhayakaragupta states that, if possible, a consort should be young and beautiful, as well as an initiate (s111Nl]ini; lit: \"holder of the pledge\"). 6} Sanderson (1995) has commented on the difference between the two tanuic traditions, stating that \"If there is a significant difference between the iconographies of the rival systems, it is that the Buddhist is more explicitly erotic than the Saiva .... In intemalising the image of Saivism, the Buddhist has exagger-ated it.\" Transgressive discipline is central to the practices and iconography"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi ofVajrayogini. She is to be visualized within a cremation ground, naked but for ornaments of bone, and not only sexually empassioned, but \"streaming\" with blood (n. 382); a provocative juxtaposition given the traditional pre-scriptions that strictly separate intercourse and menstruation (e.g., Manu, 4·4<r42). Within the context of the ordained Buddhist sangha, prescriptions for sexual practices were (if possible) even more radical in that they required a deliberate, yet legitimate, inversion of the celibate monastic code. In this way, transgressive discipline not only overturns embedded cultural norms, it intentionally challenges the fundamental ethical and doctrinal tenets of Buddhism. Rather than eradicating the \"poisons\" (lt/das) of lust (rdga/1) and wrath (d~). as traditional Buddhism would have it, the yogin is to use his passions as a means of eradicating all defilements. The highest tantras explain this type of practice as operating through a \"homeopathic cure\" (Snellgrove's translation of viparitll\"\"\"\"'iltalpandt, HT2.2.47); it works on the same analogy as the curing of poison with another dose of poison, of flatulence by eating beans, of burns by heat, and so on (HT2.2.46-49). In the same way, the poison of passion is said to be cured by passion (HT2.2.51ab).

The passage ends with a reminder that the \"cure\" worked by vamdcdra functions on the metaphysical plane through the principle of nondualism:M (v. 4) The entire universe, the three worlds including the ani-mate and inanimate, have arisen from the left (VIlma-) {or: have arisen from woman, vdmd-). The yogin whose discipline is always transgressive should step out with his left foot in front [when starting to walk], he should make offerings with the left hand,-{v. s) gratify deities and cat food with the left. The observance of five classes [namely, the four classes plus \"untouchables\"] is considered to be as one class. {v. 6) One should abandon [notions of] \"to be eaten\" or \"not to be eaten\" [with regard to solid substances], and \"to be drunk\""},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINIIN INDIA [or \"not to be drunk\" with regard to liquids], [and all] inhibition and shame.

Th~ Emergmc~ ofVajrayogini 43 These developments in the nondual Saiva and highest Buddhist tantras provided the fenile soil in which the cults of female deities took root. The cremation grounds and mountainous wilds in which the deities of the higher tantras dwelt were the locus of powerful female spirits such as yoginis and 4aJclnis and other classes of demonic female (which in Saivism included Jaltinis, yaltfi'.'is, and rtllt,asis).\"\" Qakinis are protean, flying, witchlike beings.67 Their association with tantric practice had been longstanding-Sircar (1948: 105), for example, cites an early fifth-century VaifJ.tava inscrip-tion in a temple in Mandasor that describes \"a terrible abode, full of 4akinis.\" The aim of much tantric yogic practice was to access the power of these terrible spirits by delighting them with the transgressive offerings, including offerings of sexual fluids, and inducing them to serve the yogin's own interests. On the yogini cults of the nondual Saiva Trika, Sanderson (1988: 671) writes, \"The goal of the initiate was to force or entice these yoginis to gather before him and receive him into their band (yoginiga!Jilb), sharing with him their miraculous powers and esoteric knowledge.\" Although the goddesses generally inhabited the power seats (pi!hiiS) asso-ciated with the cremation grounds, they were also believed to possess women \"and thereby to enter into the most intimate contact with their devotees\" (ibitJ.). Human or divine, Saktis were divided into recognizable classes and families, the predominant being those of the eight families of the \"mothers· (wuitrlmatrltti), namely Brihmi (or BrahnW:]i), Rudril}i (or MaheSvari), Kaumiri, Vai~J.tavi, Vmhi, Indril}i (or Aindri), QmUJ.t4a, and Mahal~mi (Sanderson 1998: 672; Heilijgers-Seelen 1994: 102). In Buddhist sources, the taming of these powerful forces is a major theme of the legendary accounts of tantric adepts or siddhas. Mahasiddha Kambala, for example, oonfronted a whole assembly of Qakini witches, forcing them to spew up the fragments of his woolen blanket, which they had cunningly stolen-and then eaten (Dudjom 1991: 486-87; Dowman 1985: 18o-83). In oommon with the Saiva ldltt4 traditions, female spirits were panicularly asso-ciated with the semimythical OqQiyana, a place name traditionally related"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi to the word tjaltini, and thus to flight. 61 0QQiyina is described in the Ug-nuls as a kingdom divided into two halves, Sambhala and Lankapuri, each having two hundred and fifty thousand towns. King Indrabhiiti ruled Sam-bhala, while Lankapuri was under the dominion ofKingjalendra who mar-ried lndrabhiiti's sister, Lalqmitikara. As for its geographical location, on the authority of the Buddha himself (as reponed in the Blue AnNlls: 361), the kingdom oflndrabhiiti is located \"in the nonhem quaner, in sri Vajra-sthana 044iyana. \"69 According to the legendary tales, Qakinis make many magical appearances in 04Qiyana. In one version of G~{ipada' s life, the adept travels to this land through divine inteiVention, where he encounters a female swineherd who becomes his instructress and later transpires to be none other than Vajravarahi herself {Dowman 1985: 273). Because yoginis were believed to take human form in this way, they were considered to be ideal consorts for yogins engaged in sexual yogic practice. Large ponions of the redaction from Saiva sources in the Cakra.satpvara corpus concern the signs by which adepts may recognize and communicate with females belong-ing to one or other of the yogini or Qakini families. 70 Because the vajra fam-ily is that to which the heruka forms of the yoginitantr.IS belong, the human consons of the vajra class were panicularly valued. The HnJajrauntra (HT1.6.8--9) recommends a girl from the vajra family (vajralutnya) as the ideal conson (failing which, the text adds, one may be taken from the fam-ily of one's chosen deity, or from some other family). The way in which Buddhist yoginis are differentiated from female spir-its of other tantric systems is by the characteristic tag vajra, the distin-guishing mark of nondual Vajrayana Buddhism. They thus become known as vajra-yoginis and vajra-4akinis. A commentarial text in the Guhya-Sil1114JilSiidhanamii/4 opens by explaining the word vajra in vajrllJOfini in just these terms: \"[The word] vajra selVes to exclude (niraltarll1J4m) the yoginis of the heretics and so fonh. \"71 The term vajrayogini was thus generic and denoted females-human or divine-who were analyzed in tantric texts by character and appearance into their various classes and families. As a solo deity, Vajrayogini is the vajra-yogini par excellence, \"leader of the yogini hordes. \"~2 That she, too, has a generic quality emerges from the texts of the Guhyasllm4JilSdtihanamal4. The great majority of sadhanas begin with a salutation to Vajrayogini, or name Vajrayogini in a bencdiaory verse or introductory statement. However, less than a third of the forms subse-quently described in the visualization are actually named \"Vajrayogini.\" We will see that most receive a different appellation and prove to be icono-graphically distinct."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE CULT Of VAJRAYOGINIIN INDIA 45 Before we move on to look at the different forms of Vajrayogini, it is important to note that her cult is but one of many female deity cults within the highest Buddhist tantras. Other vajra-yoginis had also emerged, cen-tering on female figures drawn from both exoteric and esoteric traditions. Some had been imponant female buddhas or bodhisattvas in their own right, or had appeared as relatively minor goddesses in their JJW]4aias but had now taken on tantric forms and become the focus of tantric worship. Others had been consorts to major male deities and had gradually risen in status to occupy the center of tantric maJ]4aias, with their male consort expelled. Many of the characteristics we find in the cult of Vajrayogini are also found among such deities. They, too, draw upon the stock of tantric-often Saiva-imported-imagery and method that existed within the high-est Buddhist tantras; and within their individual cults, they also manifest in different ways, rich with varying iconographical forms and siddhi-related rites. There is a great deal of overlap between some of these manifestations and the forms ofVajrayogini. A plethora of tantric forms, for example, center on the well-known fig-ure ofTara, and these in themselves provide ample evidence for the abun-dance of female deity cults in India. Indeed, tantric manifestations of Tara have so many forms that they would need a whole book to themselves. One such is Vajratara, subject of a handful oflengthy sadhanas (e.g., SM93-97), including one by Ratnakara$anti (SMuo) who has a number different forms. Another is }anguli (SMu7-22), famous for protecting from snakebite (e.g., SMu8 p. 247) and invoked during the construction of monasteries (Tanemura 2002: 67 n. 1), perhaps for this reason. Yet another is Ugratara or \"Fierce Tara\" (also known as Tara of \"Great China,\" Mahacinatara SM1oo-102), whom we have already noted shares a temple with Vajra-yogini in Sankhu, Nepal. There is also the irresistible Kurukulla (SM171-90; Beyer 1978: 301-10). Red in color, and poised to shoot a bow and arrow made of flowers, she is particularly associated with rites of love and subju-gation, characteristics we will also see among the forms ofVajrayogini. Two of Tara's former attendants (in her peacdUI KhadiraVat]i-Tara form) also rise to prominence in the tantric traditions as central deities in their own right, and both illustrate once again the way in which their tantric practices overlap with those of Vajrayogini. Ekajata is represented by only five sadhanas in the StidhaMTNIIti (SM123-27), but these describe about the same number of forms, including an extremely fierce manifestation with twenty-four arms and twelve heads; this sadhana ends with the visualiza-tion of a classic two-armed form ofVajrayogini at one's heart-red, fierce,"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi and dancing in the arJhaparyanlta pose (SM123 p. 259). Of even more obvi-ous significance to the cult ofVajravirihi is the goddess Manci who has six-teen sadhanas in the SdtihaMmald (SM132-47), and one in the Nifpan1Ul]Ogtlvali (no. 17). Within this small but diverse collection, over half a dozen forms of Marici emerge, with multiplicities of heads, arms, and legs. Like most forms of Vajravarahi, Marici is also presided over by V airocana, but her most striking similarity with Vajravarahi is the hog motif that permeates her iconography. She has a chariot drawn by seven hogs (so that she is frcquendy compared to Siirya, the Indian sun god, whose char-iot is drawn by seven horses), and several of her subsidiary heads may be hogs' heads. Even in her single-headed form she said to \"have the form of a hog\" (SM141 p. 289: iiiltarariipa-). She also has four attendants who arc all hog-headed, one of whom is called \"Hog-Face,\" Varahamukhi. The ter-rifying presence of the hog's head, in both cases, docs not preclude the god-dess' association with erotic forms of practice. Marici's attributes include a branch of an ASoka tree, as wdl as the bow and flowery arrow, and a hook and noose, all of which indicate the mode of attraction and love (and by association, the power to subjugate and bring others under one's control). Although she has many characteristics of a cremation-ground deity, Marici's sadhanas usually state that she is to be visualized within a caitya (two more of her attributes are a needle and thread, part of a monk's domestic pos-sessions), which is possibly why so many early statues of Marici remain from the Buddhist monastic sites of India. 73 Plate 5 depicts a fairly late Tibetan statue of a goddess identified by von Schroeder (2001: 1054) as Marici ('Od zer can rna). She has a single hog's head and four arms, iden-tical, in fact, to our hog-headed, four-armed form of Vajravarahi called Vajraghof)a, who also holds a vajra and hook {right) and a skull bowl and noose (left), with a staff tucked into her left shoulder. Many other examples of female deity cults could also be given, all bear-ing strong resemblances to that ofVajrayogini. Nairatmya, like Vajravarahi, is another example of a consort to a preeminent heruka deity, in this case, Hevajra. She emerges in her own right as the heroine of her own mal)c.lala based on Hevajra lines, as a handful of sadhanas in the Slidhanamald and Nqpannayogavali testify.74 Her form, while blue in color and without a hog's head, is very similar to that of the artlhaparyanlta Vajravarahi. A wonderful illustration of a blue Qakini in this pose is the early thangka from Khara Khoto in plate 3 {Nairatmya has the blue, earth-touching Buddha.Alqobhya on her headdress, indicating that she belongs to the vajra f.unily).

His conson is Buddha4akini-\"c;takini of the Buddha(s)\" -and he is worshiped in embrace with her at the center of a ~Qala of four 4akinis (who also appear elsewhere within a maJ}qaia of a wrathful black form of Vajravirihi).rs Vajrayogini herself appears in one instance as Buddha4ilini within the Trikaya Vajrayogini sadhanas, and her main mantra includes the invocation of the mantra deity, Sarvabud~. This epithet is in itself telling. While it is not the name of any independent form ofVajrayogini, according to the Indian sources I have seen, it dearly asserts that-at least within the Vajrayogini cult-Vajrayogini is understood to be the \"c;takini of all buddhas,; that is, she is the supreme manifestation of a Buddhist Qakini, the preeminent vajra-yogini, and the summation of all tantric female deities. Tht Emngmct ofVajravarahi The most common form of Vajrayogini in the Guhyas~ZTN~yasdJhaMm414 is Vajravarahi. Hailed as Vajrayogini in the salutation of most of the Vajravarahi sadhanas, Vajravarahi is regarded as essentially the same as Vajrayogini; that is, as a vajra-yogini: \"from inside that [Jharmod4ya] arises the goddess Varahi who is Vajrayogini [or: Varahi who is a vajra-yogini].\"76 Vajravarahi's name means \"vajra-hog\" (varahfl/1 is a hog or boar), or \"Bud-dhist,-Varahi. Her origins lie in the brahmanical goddess, Varahi, who was widely worshiped as one of the seven or eight mothers (mdtr/tlis); indeed, she is still worshiped as such in Nepal, although dearly distinguished from the Buddhist goddess, Vajravarahi (Gellner 1992:96, Bautze-Picron 2000). Usually portrayed with the single face of a hog or a boar, the brahmanical Varahi is the female countcrpan ofVaraha, Vi~~lU's avatara as a boar. She is often four-armed, holding hook or goad (left), noose (right), and ham-mer or mace and spear, and she is pot-bellied, fierce and powerful, invoked to destroy enemies (Biihnemann 2oooi: 12e>-21; Donaldson 1995: 158ff.). The Buddhist deity inherits her wrathful character and, just as Varahi with her gruesome head, is intended to inspire terror in her enemies, so Vajravarahi' s character is fierce and wrathful. Like Varahi, Vajravarahi does not always appear with a hog's head, but"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi in one of the commonest forms of Vajravarahi, a snarling hog's head attached sideways to the right of her head can be seen. Fearsome animal-headed forms are traditionally associated with protection, and this seems to be the purpose of the characteristic hog's head in Vajravarahi's iconogra-phy. None of the Sanskrit sadhanas add anything more on its significance or symbolism, although the pig is traditionally associated in Buddhism with the root poison of ignorance (moha/J), and Tibetan literature reads Vajra-varahi's hog's head as the sublimation of that passion (e.g., Simmer-Brown 2001: 142). I have seen only one passing reference in Sanskrit sources in this connection: a goddess, Pramoha (\"Deluder\"), appears in an early yogini-type mat:t9ala who is said to have the face of the \"primal boar\" (i.e., Vi~~u as Varaha) with a \"deluding gaze.\" Even here, however, the text's empha-sis is upon her wrathful character.n Wrathful tantric deities are said to be \"fearful to fear itselr'-or \"dangerous to danger itself\" (e.g., HT2.5.8: bhayasyapi bhayanaka'!'}-and thus their wrath is understood to be an expression of their great compassion. Vajravarahi, in common with other tantric deities, is described as \"terrifying (bhqa!ld) with anger [which is in fact displayed out of] compassion (karu,_,altrodha). \"71 The hog-faced goddess seems to have entered Buddhist scripture in the yogatantras. In the Sarvatathtigatatattvasa'!'graha (ch. 6: 6o), Varahi is named as one of the Saiva all-mothers (sarvamdtfs) located in the hell regions, who upon her conversion to the Buddhist ~9ala by Vajrap3r)i assumes the name Vajramukhi (\"Vajra Face\"). In the yoginitantras, a hog-faced goddess \"Varahi\" appears in Heruka m~9alas as one of many atten-dant goddesses, such as those surrounding the Yamiri forms in the K.T!'.'IlJamtiritantra and commentary. As we have seen above, she is also one of a set of hog-faced attendants to Marici, along with the hog-faced Vart(t)ali, who is another form of the brahmanical Varahi and also associ-ated with protection (Biihnemann op. cit.: 152-54). Vajravarahi assumes greater importance in the m~9alas when she becomes the conson of the central Heruka manifestation; and in this role, her iconography changes. She appears in the Hroajratantra at the end of its proto-sadhana (HT1.3) as the \"wisdom\" (prajna)conson of an alternative form ofHevajra with four arms. Here she is described as having the same form as her lord, that is, blue in color, and holding the skull bowl and vajra in her free hands (HT1.3.17), but without any mention of a hog's head. She is also described as an alter-native conson to Hevajra in a couple of mat:t9alas in the Nifpannayogtivali . ., But Vajravarahi really takes center stage within the Heruka ~9alas only when she is taken up as conson to Cakrasarpvara. The tantric systems cen-"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINi IN INDIA 49 tered on Cakras31!1vara worship him as a blue, Heruka, Bhairava-typc deity with twelve arms, who holds Vajravarahi in embrace (plate u). Here the goddess assumes her own distinctive form, once again without any hog's head. She is red, two-armed, and maddened with lust. In her right hand she holds a vajra, and in her left she raises aloft a skull bowl overflowing with blood, which she pours into the open mouth of her lord so that he may drink. Vajravarahi remains the consort of Cakrasaqtvara when he manifests in other guises, such as the form ofVajrasattva-Jfianac:{aka at the center of the $1ltcaltravartimaruf,a/a from the Abhial11i110ttllratantra, in which the central couple is surrounded by five Qaka-buddhas. Here she is named var-iously jfiana<Jakini, jfianadhatvi$vari, or Vajravarahi (Nqpannayogavali: 79). Her iconographic form tends to change in response to the form assumed by Cakrasarpvara. For example, when she appears as consort of the six-armed Sap~ra manifestation of Cakrasarpvara, she likewise has six arms and nearly identical attributes, except that she holds a bow and arrow where Cakras31!1vara holds a flayed human skin (SM251: 491). In yet another tantric tradition, Vajravarahi is consort to the Heruka form of Hayagriva. As the yogini cults took root, Vajravarahi becomes the leader of the mat]~a in her own right. Our survey of Olal)~as in the Guhyasa1111lya-sa4htuutmalli shows her to be the central deity, both in embrace with Cakra-saqtvara, and more commonly as a \"solitary heroine\" (tkavird)without any consort. Here we find that Vajravarahi is capable of manifesting a number of different forms, and that she assumes something of the generic quality associated with Vajrayogini. In Vijayavajra's Vajrayoginisdtihana (GSS35), for example, Vajravarahi is the subject of the salutation, while Vajrayogini is actually the deity of the visualization. Elsewhere, a commentator states that all Qikinis are born in the Varahi f.unily.110 Despite the richness of its iconography, the Guhyasamll]asdtihanamli/4 is by no means exhaustive, and there were doubdess many variations ofVajravarahi in other works of tantric literature and art. (For example, an eighteenth-century Nepalese tangka shows a rare image ofVajravarahi with six arms and four variously colored hogs' heads attached to her central human face; Kreiger 1999, plate 22.) One of the most classic forms of Vajravarahi is that described in the Vlljravdrdhi Sdtihana by Umapatideva (GSSu), the subject of our study in chapter 3· This sadhana centers on the warrior-stance form of Vajravarahi with no hog's head. Both wrathful and erotic in character, she stands in the center of a retinue of yoginis within a thirty-seven-fold RW]4ala."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"so VAJRAYOGINI Dancing-Pos~ (ardhaparyanlta) Vajravarahi One of the main manifestations ofVajrayogini is as Vajravarahi in the half-paryanka (ardhaparyanka) pose. This is the posture in which she stands upon her left leg, deeply flexed, and bends her right leg so that the sole of her foot rests upon her left thigh. She is dancing the wild tti!Vfava dance of Siva at the end of the aeon. Dance (nli.tyam) plays a large part within clas-sical Indian notions of dramatic an, and Buddhist tantric deities (follow-ing Saiva norms) arc often said to be equipped with the nine dramatic sentiments (rasta).•• Vajravarahi appears with this form in the two opening sadhanas of the GuhyasamayastitihaMmdlti. in two very similar texts, both ascribed to key tantric authorities. The Oral T ratiition ofVajrll]Ogini ( Vajra-yoginimukhiigama GSS1) is ascribed to Indrabhuti (and elsewhere to Sahara, sec appendix), and the VajrayoginisiiJhana (GSS2) to Liiyipada. Drawing on this older material, the Abhisamayamafijari (GSS5 Sed p. 152, K37lJ) also includes the form, as do two of the self-consecration (wtitihif!hilM) sadhanas (GSSj2 Kio6n, GSS34 KII2r6).'2 In the West, the dancing image is perhaps the best known iconograph-ical form ofVajravarahi. In filet, B. Bhattacharyya (I924II98s:Is6) was so misled by its prevalence as to state that Vajravarahi and Vajrayogini arc sep-arate goddesses with individual stances: the ardhaparyanka pose for Vajravarahi, and the warrior (a/it!ha!1) stance for Vajrayogini-although the GuhyasamayastitihaMmiilti sadhanas clearly show that both poses arc used for both deities (and that the distinction between the two forms is anyway not so simple). Rather confusingly, von Schroeder invents the des-ignation, \"Va$ya Vajravarahf' for ardhaparyanka forms of Vajravarahi holding the chopper, although this is without any valid textual basis.13 Examples of the dancing Vajravarahi arc reproduced here in plates 1, 4, and 8, and others arc published elsewhere ... A couple of very similar versions of this form also appear among the Mongolian icons (fig. 3 below), based on two almost identical sadhanas in the Rin 'byung brgJa rtsa (Willson and Brauen 2000: 257-58, 259). The first is the \"two-faced Vajravarahi in the dPyal tradition., (rDo rj~ phag mo zhal gnyis ma dpyallug.s) whose right hand holds the chopper facing outward;•~ the second is the form of Vajravarahi associated with Indrabhuti, \"[two-]faced Varahi, Indra[bhuti]'s Qakini\" (Phag mo zhal gnyis ma Indra mkha • spyod). whose right hand holds the chopper facing inward. The latter is one of a set of three cJakinis ( mKha • spyod skor g.sum = kh~cari cyck) comprising the forms of Vajrayogini associated with Naropa, Maitripa, and lndrabhuti.16 Both forms of the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINi IN INDIA 51 dancing Vajravar.ihi are said in the Tibetan sadhanas to be presided over by Alqobhya.

As if to emphasize the terrifying nature of the hog's head, our texts add that her main face is \"angry.\" She brandishes a vajra chopper aloft in her right hand, and in the left she holds a skull bowl to her heart. Her other attributes are the tantric bone ornaments typical of a cremation-ground goddess known as the sect marks, or signs of observance (mudras; see ch. 3). Here (in GSSt=GSS2) she wears five mudras: a chaplet, earrings, necklace, armlets, and girdle, all of bone found in a cremation ground. As leader of a maJ.lc:Wa (in GSS34), she wears the sixth mudra also from a cremation ground: ash. There is no men-tion of a skull staff or corpse throne in any of the Guhyasamayasadhanama/a sources-although these do appear in some artistic representations of the goddess.~ .. The influence of esoteric Saivism is evident in the five skulls upon Vajravarahi's headdress, which are described as the \"five Brahmas.\"88 Despite her wrathful nature, the iconography of the goddess is also ovenly erotic. She is red like the China rose, \"lovely with fresh youth,\" and with \"charming plump arms and feet. \"lt'l The letters of her mantra are to be visualized within a dharmodaya that is located inside the goddess's sex; it is red in color, blazing, full to the brim with syllables, and whirling around \"like a potter's wheel. \"'10 This visualization is externalized in a rite prescribed by Indrabhuti (GSSt K8ors) that mirrors the vision of the whirling mantra syllables.

The text first describes the drawing of a prastdra, or \"spread\"; this is a dia-gram split into individual cells, the number of which is described (possibly intentionally) in rather cryptic terms (n. 95).

Thus, we find that the prastlira echoes the visualization of the mantra described above, as it takes the invencd triangular \"E\" shape of the Jharmo-uyi, or woman's sex, filled with \"whirling\" syllables. The author then explains where each syllable of the mantra is to be found by providing a cipher known as the \"extraction of the mantra\" (m411trot1Jhllra[1). First, the text explains, the mantrin must find the letter in the cell above the \"tha\" (itself found on the second line).

Each is seated upon a corpse throne, with a male conson who holds them in the gesture of embrace with a vajra and bell. They are visu-alized as red in color, with three faces, three eyes, and six arms; their hair hangs loose, and they wear all the usual bone ornaments. In their six arms, they bear a vajra and bell, a skull bowl and staff, and a hook and noose, which they shake up and down with a threatening gesture. Four more god-desses (Vajrajvalottama, etc.) are visualized at the gates with the same form, although possibly with only two arms, holding a noose and a vajra (the text is ambiguous). Installed in each corner of the outer maJ)Qala is a primed bow and arrow, traditionally the weapon of the love god, Kama. The deities in embrace, and their attributes symbolic of love and attrac-tion, indicate the erotic mode of the sadhana. There is no mention of wrath-ful or terrifying characteristics, only of the compassionate, wish-fulfilling nature of the deities. In this respect, Red Vajravarahi conforms more closely to the sensual Vajravilasini forms described below, and shares with them an iconographical association with the erotic Saiva goddess of the Srividya cult, Tripurasundari (below). The sadhana ends with the recitation of mantras for all the female maJ)c;lala deities. Red Vajravarahi's mantra is unusual in that it includes the vocative of the single mantra deity, Vajravarahi (o'!l irivajravarahi lip va'!l hii'!l hii'!l phaf svaha). The mantras of the retinue follow suit, with the name of each goddess insened between a string of mantra syllables; these include jafJ hii'!l va'!l hop. syllables notable for their power to attract. 10~"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi Fig. 7· Marztjala ofsix-armtd Vajravlirahi with consort Cmtral lotus 1.

The stages of this fairly complex sadhana, and the subsequent rituals, arc summarized in the appendix. The maQ9ala retinue is described in some detail (GSS16 K78n-79n).

They are visualized with one face, four arms, three eyes, and wearing all the tantric ornaments.

At the outer gates are eight more 9akinis. In the cardinal directions (installed counterclockwise) four 9akinis are visualized dancing upon a \"lotus moon\" (padmacarulrt) and declaring their transcendence of male deities of other religions by trampling the corpses oflndra, Yalqa (Kubera), }ala (VaruQa), and Yama respectively. They hold the same attributes as the 4akinis of the inner maQ9ala, only substituting different implements for the 4amaru. such as a hook (in the cast) or a noose (in the north); the text for the other attributes is corrupt (K78VI-2).

Here, VajravarahiNarahi (the vajra-prefix is often dropped) is named as one of four outer goddesses in the maJ)4alas of the god Y amari (installed counterclockwise: Vajra-Carci.ka, Vajra-Varahi, Vajra-Sarasvati, and Vajra-Gauri); Vajravarahi is to be visual-ized as \"three-headed, six-armed, a hog, having a vajra in her hand, very blue. \"113 The commentator, Kumaracandra, glosses gho!\"11fl as \"having a hog's face\" (gho!Jd'!' iti liilt4ramulthi1f1), and the goddess' mantra includes the voca-tives \"You with the vajra snout! You with the lovely snout!\" In the Y amari maJ]4ala described by Kwnaracandra, a three-faced Vajravarahi also appears in which the central &ce is again that of the hog. ••• From our available sources, however, the justification for calling this man-ifestation Vajragho~a is slim. One of our texts eschews the term vajragho!Jd altogether (GSS15), and another uses it only as an adjective, placing it within a string of adjectival (bahuvrihi) qualifications (GSS18). The K.'P.'4Jil11111ri-t4ntra demonstrates the general fluidity in Sanskrit between qualifications and epithets by using the term both adjectivally, and nominally as the vocative in the mantra. Neverthdess, in the Abhisamayam4fljari (GSSs Sed p. 149, K34t-v), Vajragho!Jd is dearly used as a proper noun, as it describes the visu-alization of the goddess as the \"glorious Vajragho1_1a method,\" and the asso-ciated rituals as the \"Vajragho~ Sadhana.\"m The Abhisamayamafijari possibly shows a more developed version of the manifestation, in part because it promotes the adjeaive to nominal form, and also because it presents an alternative visualization of a second Vajraghol}i form, as described below. In a Nepalese sketchbook possibly dating back to the eighteenth century, the artist depicts a form of\"Vajraghoi]a\" (holding a trident skull staff, instead of a hook) (Buhnemann: 2003).

Inside this, a blazing red hri'!' is visualized at the center of a red, round-leafed lotus, resting (in GSS15) upon a sun disk placed upon a corpse. Vajravarahi is self-visualized as the transformation of all this, stand-ing in the warrior stance, also upon a lotus, corpse, and sun disk. She is four-armed and holds in her right hand a vajra and hook, and in her left, a skull bowl with staff, and a noose with a threatening gesture of the forefinger. She is bright red in color, while the yellow hair of her head streaks upward, standing on end. She has a dwarfish potbelly, and her tongue lolls as she laughs a laugh that is \"unbearable to all evil beings.\" (Laughter and wrath are connected in tantric iconography, as laughter is one of the means whereby deities spread terror.) She is visualized wearing the five mudras and a garland of heads, and is otherwise naked.116 She is depicted in this way, without any bone ornaments, in the Mongolian icons (see fig. 10 and plate 1oc). She is also drawn in an unusual stance, in which her outstretched right leg turns to rest upon its heel, with the toes pointing upward, while her head looks to her right. The Tibetan text explains this as \"trampling on the three worlds in tilitjha (right leg extended) in the manner of a wrestler's throw (gyad kyi dor stabs kyis}' (Willson and Brauen ibid.).11' Fig. 10.

The auxiliary heart mantra also diverges from that of the main VajrayoginiNajrarir.ihi tradition in its use of an imperative for van-quishing obstacles, of the sort f.uniliar in bali rituals (o'!' vajravarahi l1vday4 sa1'VIlfiun4n hri'!' svaha). 118 The mantras for both rites that follow appear with some variants, but arc similar to the heart mantra in that they consist of strings of syllables ( afJ hri'!l hu,_ ha,. hi[1. and p'\"\"pht,). The rituals are to be performed by the sadhaka who has generated him-self as Vajraghof)a for the attainment of siddhi and has performed one hun-dred thousand recitations of the mantras. The wrathful character of the goddess is reflected in a desiderative worship that includes incense made from powdered human flesh, which is offered in front of an image of the goddess on a doth for twenty-one days, and a nighttime bali offering (see ch. 3) made \"for the purpose of queUing all maras. \"119 For this practice, the utmost secrecy is enjoined and, indeed, is the precondition upon which \"me vajrayoginis (or Vajrayogini) will empower [him].\"110 Whiu Vajragho1Jii Vajravarahi An alternative form ofVajraghol}i Vajravarahi is taught in the Abhisa1Nl]ll-1Nlfijari (GSSs Sed p. 149, K34v5). According to this transmission, she is generated at the heart (ramer than the navel), upon a red lotus. First, a sun disk is produced from 41!1-Upon this stands a red five-pointed vajra, empow-ered by a white hrib that transforms into the goddess. Since the color of a deity is wually a reflex of the seed-syllable, this form ofVajraghol)i is pre-sumably white. She stands upon a lotus that is uniquely striped red and white, trampling in warrior stance \"a sleeping man [symbolic] of igno-rance.\" In her heart is a replica red vajra on a sun disk, also presided over by a white hri[1 on a sun disk. The text states that in other respects she is like the previous manifestation of red Vajraghol}a (i.e., a therianthropic goddess with four arms). Unwually, however, this form ofVajraghol}a is empowered by Alqobhya, enthroned upon a multicolored lotus.121 That we are dealing with a white form of Vajragho~ is perhaps con-firmed by her similarity to a white form of Vajravarahi, who appears in another sadhana in the collection. We will see that the generation, sclf-visualizaton, and ritual prescriptions for each are strikingly similar."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINi IN INDIA White Vajravarahi The practice of \"Noble White Vajravarahi\" is prescribed in the sadhana of that name (Aryafuklavajravtirtihisadhana GSS38). This is the only other form of white Vajravarahi in the Guhyasamayasadhanamtilii and one in which the process of generation is very similar to that of white Vajraghot:li. (A much fuller account of this form--or one very similar, with identical rites-is described in SM218-2o; see appendix for details.) White Vajravarahi is self-generated upon a sun disk (produced from a'!') and from a white hrib that transforms first into a five-pointed vajra and then into Vajravarahi. She also carries a white hrib on a sun disk at her hean and is presided over by Alqobhya-apart from white Vajraghol)a, the only form ofV ajrayogini in the Guhyasamayastidhanamtilii to bear this buddha as the seal. 121 White Vajravarahi shares the explicitly wrathful character of the Vajraghol)a manifestations. The text describes itself as a \"fierce\" sidhana, and the deity is said to bring fear to gods, antigods, and men. There are some differences, however, between the two forms. For example, white Vajravarahi is generated following an empti-ness meditation, and is thus produced from emptiness rather than at the navel. Most notably, there is no mention of a hog's head in the iconography of white Vajravarahi. She is self-visualized in the warrior stance, naked but for the five mudras, and wearing a curious garland consisting of a row of skulls between two rows of vajras (although SM218 describes it rather as a garland worn on the headdress). She is two-armed and carries a vajra in her right and a skull staff in her left, with no skull bowl. Worship both before and after the self-visualization is performed by \"Pracai)Qa etc.,\" which, judging from the fuller descriptions ofSM218 (p. 427), refers to the presence of the twenty-four god-desses of the sites, within the mal)9ala circles of mind, speech, and body. m Fig. n.

The japa in both cases consists of the recita-tion of a white syllable hrifl that is visualized in garland form as a \"mantra rosary\" (mantramdld). In a yogic meditation (described in slightly more detail in the Abhisamayamanjari GSSs and SM218), the self-generated yogin-goddess sees a white hrib syllable at the navel and imagines it revolv-ing through him, exiting through the mouth and entering again at the navel. As it enters the navel, the mantramdldbrings him the [mundane] power of all the arts and sciences as well as the mass of [supramundane] qualities of the buddhas. According to the Abhisamayamanjari:124 Next on his navel he should see a (white) hriflon a red and white sun disk placed on a multicolored lotus. He should send forth from the opening of his mouth a mantra garland of that [sylla-ble hrib] in the form of a string of beads, white [in color, and] whirling like (-yogma) a wheel. Having obtained skill in medi-cine, astronomy, writing, and the sciences and arts by means of the jewel mantra of the many-faceted (gu!fllga1Jil) buddha, he should contemplate [this mantra garland], which burns all the ignorance of oneself and others, entering the opening of his navel. He should recite the mantra, avoiding the f.tult of doing it too fast [or too slow]. The mantra is hri/1. When he wants to arise [from the practice], he should make that mantra garland disap-pear into the hrifl in his navel, perform worship [bali rites, etc.], and dwell as he wishes [namely. in the form of the deity]. The texts describe funher rites using the mantramli/4 (GSSs Sed p. 150.8, K35r4, SM218 p. 430, and briefly in GSS38 KI23n) for the acquisition of other siddhis, such as supreme learning, scholarship, powers of oration. invin-cibility in debate, and freedom from fevers and poisons-all of which would seem particularly handy in the political arena. For this, the tongue is first imagined in the shape of a lotus petal, and on it a flaming white hri/1 forms a garland of fifty beads. So powerful is this practice, that-the texts claim-if a piece of chalk is consecrated with this mantra in this way, then the one who holds it, be he even a fool, will become a poet. Toward similar ends per-haps, the GSS texts also claim the power of this mantramald for bending another to his will or subjugation (vaiyam). although the rather fuller sadhana that describes this rite in the Sdtlhtmamd/a (SM21~2o) states that the purpose of this rite is to bring beings into the four truths of the Buddhists (p. 432:"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINi IN INDIA 71 sattvan va.fi/trtya caturaryasa~ avatlira!Jiiya ... ).

He may then generate her meditatively within a red Jharmodayti upon a white lotus. At the center of the lotus, Vajrayogini appears standing upon the flayed skin of Bhairava \"with the method of the falling turtle.\" This seems to be a reference to her stance, as it is the pose later prescribed for the yogin himself during the midnight bali ritual. She is yellow in color, naked, with dishevelled hair, and (only) two eyes, which she fixes upon the sadhaka. Her attributes are those of Vajrayogini, the chopper and skull bowl. She laughs the terrifying laugh of Siva, and is \"terrifying because of her extreme desire. \"139 Having visualized Vajrayogini as if she were present before his very eyes (stilqad iva), the yogin is then to worship her with transgressive bali offer-ings of yogic substances (yogiJravyam).1~ The bali mantra is based on the mantra deity Vajrayogini, although the foUowingjapa mantra is the ten-syllabled heart mantra ofVajravarahi (o'!' vajravairocaniyt svaha).

In these works, Vajrayogini is described as a vidyadhari, a lovely, celestial maiden. The classical association with vidyadharis is of beauty and lovemaking; one poet, for example, paints the heavenly damsels writing love letters on birch bark.14~ Fig. 18.

The Tibetan text calls this form \"Maitri's I)akini, Playful Mantra-holder\" (Mai tri mltha' spyoJ rig pa t/zjn pa rtun ma). which points to an association with Maitripada/ Advayavajra found also in the Sanskrit sources (notably, the *Sit/Jha-Amntiya).'48 This form is also illustrated to the right of the main figure in plate 9· In keeping with the feminine mood of the sadhana, the observance that the yogin undenakes on the basis of visualizing Vidyadhari Vajrayogini is the \"mad observance\" (unmattacarya).

Accord-ing to our Sanskrit sources, the mad observance begins with a period of worship (pujti) that lasts for six months and (in GSS22) with the prayer that the goddess grant the fruit of mahamudra. During this time, Vidyadhari Vajrayogini is generated and worshiped within the triangular dharmodaytl that the yogin has drawn onto the surface of a highly polished mirror using vermilion powder. Taking more of the powder, the yogin inscribes her seed-syllable va'!' outside the triangle at the corners and the syllables of her mantra inside it. He also draws four counterclockwise bliss swirls at the four points (the cardinal directions) surrounding the triangle.•so Fig. 19.

When he has finished, he takes the vermilion powder he has just used in the rite, and puts it to one side in a special container. He repeats this process at auspi-cious times for a period of six months, either on the eighth day of the lunar months (GSSs) or during a lunar or solar eclipse (GSS22). When the six months are up, the yogin takes his collected store of vermilion powder and places it inside the hollow stem of a llingali (coconut) tree. According to Gyatso (ibitJ.), the /4nga/i is similar to bamboo (although bigger), in that the stem is also knotted, like a tube with natural blockages. In order to stopper the open end, the yogin must make a special plug that he carves on one side with a bliss swirl-he will later use this as a stencil for marking a bliss swirl on his own forehead. The yogin then takes the llingali stem and buries it in a cremation ground, performing a further month of bali offer-ings and mantra recitation. (Gyatso describes how the yogin sits on the earth above the hurried llingali container, while an attendant stays nearby reciting the Heruka mantra to prevent interruptions.) This ends the prepa-ration of the vermilion powder, and the yogin is now ready to set out upon the mad observance itself. To undenake the mad observance, the yogin must remove the sacred vermilion powder from its secret burial site and use it to draw a sign upon his forehead-either a six-pointed star (GSS12) or a bliss swirl (GSSs; K. Gyatso 1999). He then wanders about as if he were mad, seeking alms in the village (GSSs) or in solitary sites. A scriptural source for the practice is found in Sat,lvarodayatantrawhere, adopting the \"crazy observance\" (vatu/4 caryi), the yogin is to wander alone without companions, \"like an agitated bird.\"m Wherever he meets a woman in a secluded place-by a dcsened dwelling. an empty well, or such like-the yogin should circumambulate her in counterclockwise f.ashion. The aim is to discover, and propitiate, a living emanation ofVajrayogini. He will recognize her by the fact that the bliss swirl upon his own forehead is magically transferred to hers. (Gyatso adds that to make sure, the yogin can check in his mirror to see if his own bliss swirl has indeed disappeared.) The mad observance is based upon the principles of mahamudra, accord-ing to which all women are to be worshiped because all women embody the goddess, just as all men embody the god. m Our tats claim the lineal tradi-tion of Sahara (GSSs Sed p. 153, K38r6-SM135), an adept whose association with mahamudra is developed in the next Vidyadhari Vajrayogini text (GSS13), and in the erotic sadhana of Guhyavajravilasini described below."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi Flying Vidyadhari Vajrayogini The second vidyadhari in the Guhyasamayasadhanamti/a is a flying form of Vajrayogini, with four three-eyed faces of different colors.

After this time, however, Sahara had still had no vision, and despite redou-bling his efforts and practicing assiduously for twelve years, he f.Uied to see her \"even in a dream.\" He became disheartened and was about to lose f.Uth in the buddhas and give up completely when the goddess finally appeared to him amid the mountainous peaks:1~5 Then, in a flash, there was suddenly a direct vision of the god-dess adorned with color, arms, and so on to be described below. • [Sht apptartd} bttwttn (madhye) tht surpassingly captivating, most lovtly mountains [ca/kJ] Manobhanga (Dtstruction of tht [D~kd} Mind) and CittavilrlimA (Htart's RqJDst!Rtsting-pl4ct of tht Mind/; [these] had five peaks of different colors, and were adorned with gardens in which Nigaltnara flowers were bloom-ing in colorful pools. •or: [Sht apptartd} in tht midst oftht surpassingly captivating, most lovtly mountains whtrt tht mind comn to mt btcaust oftht dmruc-tion of tht tkfiltJ mind.

The GuhyavajravildsiniSJU/hana (GSS1o) seems to name them as a pair (though with a possible ambiguity, n. 169), and they are also described in the dual in the* SitJJha-Amnliya (except for one occurrence in the singular), where they arc located in the external world, in DalqiJ]apatha.1~ Manobhanga is also mentioned in the sadhana ofVajraQakini Vajravarahi (GSSr6), which claims the legendary authority of the LalqabhiJhanatantTa: \"On Mount Manobhailga, which is the most essential [place] on earth, on"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINI this peak [or: within this dwelling] (tasmin lti!~), in a pavilion (-mll!\"//zpt) that is the sole resting place of the mind (cittavilrdmll-) for the great-minded, [is] the terrible .. .leader Vajravarahi. \"•~., Although the verse does not mention the second mountain, Cittavisrama, it suggests that on the mountain peak (ltifam) there is also a pavilion (mll!\"//zpfl/1/m) that is the \"resting place of the mind\" (cittaviirdmll-).

There is a small class of goddesses, the ten vajra-viltisinis, who act as the agents of the consecration in the Abhisa1Nl]ll-maftjari (GSSs K22VI), and perhaps Vajravilasini arose as a generic form of this vildsini type.

Advayavajra (at this point bearing the ordained name Maitrigupta) is prompted by a voice in a dream to leave his monastery and to set out, first for Khasarp~, and then for Manobhanga and Cinavisrama in Dalqi~apatha-the place where he will find the adept who will be his preceptor, Sabardvara.

In despair on the tenth day, he is about to cut off his own head when Sahara appears before him, consecrates him, and gives him the new name, Advayavajra.172 Advayavajra's practice of Vajrayogini is not immediately successful. His preceptor orders him to demonstrate how all appearances--even the Buddhist precept of nonviolence-are illusory (pril!'fltipatamdyd) by chopping off the head of his companion, Sigara, and then restoring it.

A tale with some similarities is recounted by Taranatha in his History (pp. 191--95), perhaps suggesting that this story is an adaptation of the mythology that surrounds AvalokitcSva.ra. Taranatha's account describes the journey of the layman Santivarman, a contemporary of the prctantric Dignaga. In response to a dream, the king sends the upasaka to seek the res-idence of Avalokitdvara on Potala mountain, and to request his aid in coun-teracting famine and epidemic in Jambudvipa. Santivarman first reaches the temple of sri-Dhanyaka~ on the island of*Dhana$ri, after which he trav-els first underground and then above ground to reach Potala. After even-tually meeting the bodhisattva, Santivarman returns by himself, and while he is resting on the way, Avalokitdvara joins him, coming \"through the sky\" to the place that henceforth becomes known as *KhasarpaJ:.la (\"Sky-going\"). Later, Santivarman makes two further visits to Potala, one of them at the behest of monks at VaraJ]asi to solve a textual problem in their scriptures. Santivarman's and Advayavajra's stories share several features. Both undertake their journeys as a result of a dream, and both journeys are to mountainous regions accessible only through magical means. Both travel-ers fail at first to find the mountain and must engage in a period of medi-tation before meeting the deity/adept, but both finally receive a \"direct vision\" on the mountain. Both travelers pass through sri-DhanyakaraJca and KhasarpaJ:.la, and finally, both are concerned to further the academic understanding of the scriptures. The earlier story may have come to inform the Advayavajra legend through the association ofSabara with Avalokitd-vara. Sahara's chosen deity (if!'Ukvata) is the eleven-headed, thousand-armed form of Avalokite5vara called Mahikaru.~]ika (B/.w Annals p. 1044; Dowman 1985: 62). In the Guhyavajravi/tisinisddhana (GSS1o), Sahara is taught by his teacher KaruJ:.la to visualize himself as Padmanartc:Svara, a form of the bodhisattVa Loke5vara/Lokanatha (AvalokitcSva.ra), while the ArddhanaviJhi (GSS23) is said to have to be taught by LokcSvara in Sabara's form. 17~ Sahara's iconography also echoes that of the bodhisattVa A valoki-teS\\'ara.

In addition to her shared lineage and location, Guhyavajravilasini bears iconographical resemblances to Vidyadhari Vajrayogini, as well as to"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINIIN INDIA Vajravilasini. The first descriptions appear in the preparations to the sidhana, in which the partners arc directed to wash and adorn themselves and, after making love, position themselves in the posture of the deities ready for the preliminary meditations and the self-generation (these elabo-rate prescriptions arc summarized in the appendix). After evoking the deities through a series of awakenings consonant with practice of sexual yoga (I<47VI ff, vv. 38-45), the yogin is ready to visualize his consort as Guhya-vajravilasini. He sees her as bright red, or perhaps yellow, in color, \"clad [only] in her own loveliness.\" She is thus naked, without any ornament except the pearl necklace, an aiolta flower behind her car, and an added streak of red lac across her forehead. 174 In her right hand she holds aloft a vajra chopper in a graceful arc; in her left she holds a noose. She is dizzy with the intoxication of love (lola-). and her girdle swings to and fro with the movements of her love-play (/ildnJolitamrlthala-). She is visualized mak-ing love to her consort in the following posture: \"[seated] with her sex placed on the elevation ofPadmanarta's \"banner\" (i.e., penis). in the squat-ting (utltu!4) posture/'~ giving seductive smiles with flirtatious glances ... lovely with [her] flowing sex because of the touches of [his] throbbing penis.\"176 The yogin, her consort, does not visualize himself as Cakrasarpvara but as Padmanarta; that is, as Padmanartdvara, \"Lord of the Dance (narta/1) in the Lotus [Family],\" the esoteric reflex of Avalokitdvara. His self-visualization (1<48r4, vv. 54--63) is given in terms as erotic and explicit as that of the goddess. Padmanartc$vara is said to embody the beauties of a six-teen-year-old youth; he is a vibrant red and, like his consort, is adorned only with an alolta flower behind the ear, a streak (of gold) across his fore-head (l<48r6, v. s6c), and a dangling pearl necklace. His attributes are a yellow lotus in the left hand and a vajra in the right. His eyes arc half closed in ecstatic pleasure, as he reclines slighdy on his back, his lower left leg somewhat contracted, and his right leg stretched out with his consort placed between them. 177 He visualizes himself\" causing Vilasini to dance with his penis (guhyavajrn,ut). which is very much in evidence. \"171 And he embraces her again and again, murmuring (ltiijita) with pleasure, intensely passion-ate, and entirely absorbed in the \"innate\" (sahaja-) bliss. The deities are shown in figure 22, in which we attempt to depict this anatomically challenging pose. We follow the conventions of the Mongo-lian icons in seating the deities upon a lotus, although none is prescribed in our text. Since the yogin is to place himself upon a \"comfortable seat\" (1<471: sulthtisanasamasina-), we show them seated upon a deerskin (cf."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"90 VAJRAYOGINi IWS/T 88, LC 598). According to the text, the practice and the self-visualization take place \"on a mountain or some such place, in a cave, in a place [full] of fragrant flowers, in a deserted dwelling, or if one wishes, in a garden or an empty wood. \"r7\"J The GuhyavajraviltisinistiJhaNZ is unusual in the GuhyasamllyastiJhaNZ-malti collection in that the sadhaka visualizes himself as the male deity. But Vajravilasini is evidently the central deity. She is the first to be described as a result of the generation from the consort's sex/ dharmodaya, and the mantra concealed within the extraction of the mantra (mantroJJharab) belongs to her and not to the god. The female consort is also given a degree of independence from her partner in the worship that follows the conse-cration (l<49ri-49V2, vv. 68-79). For example, each partner worships the other's body with offerings of flowers, fruit, and incense (l<49r4), gives the other betel nut, and recites loving verses, exchanging \"sweet noth-ings. \"••o Furthermore, after the erotic rituals have been performed, the text describes how the female consort may perform the practice upon the male partner (K51V3, vv. 119-20). The sadhana's prescriptions for the behavior of the consort even continue in a section that covers the contingency of no consort being available, when the text describes a method of mastur-bation for each partner separately, combined with the visualization of the full sexual act. ••• Sanderson (1999: personal communication) has pointed out that the iconographic and mantric form of Guhyavajravilasini is close to that of the Saiva goddess of the Srividya cult, Lalita (\"Playful\")-Tripurasundari (\"Beau-tiful Goddess of the Three Worlds\"). Tripurasundari {also called Kamd-vari, \"Lady of Love\") is depicted in the main scripture of the cult as red, with red garments, garlanded with red flowers, one-faced and four-armed, carrying a noose, hook, a bow and five arrows (the five arrows of the love god), and seated above lower gods on the body of white Sada.Siva.112 Guhya-vajravilasini is similar to the Saiva goddess in that she holds a noose, and like her, is red in color, of unparalleled beauty, and seductive by nature. Their names too are similar, as Tripurasundari's alternative appellation is \"Lalita,\" which like \"Vilasini\" is suggestive of the sport oflove. Most telling ofTripurasundari's influence, however, is Guhyavajravilasini's mantra sup-plied in the mantra extraction (m~~ntrodtiharab. GSS1o K52r4, vv. 129-32). This reveals a distinctive five-syllabled mantra ( nJt iili'!l ri'!l rU'Jl blim), the syllables of which are a calque upon the five \"arrow\" syllables of the Saiva goddess, as taught in the Vam~~kdvarim~~ta (Sanderson ibit/.).'83 The male consorts in the two traditions are also similar in that both are"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE CUlT OF VAJRAYOGINi IN INDIA 91 \"lords of love,\" nwters, or gods (iivara-) of sexual pleasure (/uima!J, surata/1). Tripurasundari perches upon Kamdvara's left thigh, while Vajravilasini makes love with Padmanandvara: \"The practitioner is to visualize himself in this way as Padmanandvara, the lord of sexual pleasure, as though he were great bliss itself made manifest.\"114 As a form of Avalokite5vara, Padma-nartdvara's connection with the compassionate Vajravilasini goddesses seems particularly appropriate, and this is borne out on the mythical level by Sahara's association with the practice, discussed earlier. In drawing upon the form of Padmanartdvara in this way, Sanderson has suggested that the Guhyasam4yasaJhanamti/4 sadhana may be using material from the lesser-known pans of the Buddhist tradition in order to accommodate new Saiva-based elements within the Buddhist tradition. The name \"Padmanar-tdvara\" itself is, of course, immediately reminiscent of Siva as \"Lord of the Dance,\" Nataraja. 18~ The soteriological goal of the practice is mahamudri. This is described here as one of the magical powers (siddhis) attainable by realizing Guhya-ajravilasini: \"Having obtained [the siddhis of] subjugation and bringing near, paralyzing, slaying, and driving forth, the eye ointment [for invisibil-ity], the preparation of the pill (gut!iltasiJJhib). and many others, {v. 9) and [also] the state of mahamudri., I verbally entreated [Vajravilasini with the following words]: 'When a practitioner visualizes you according to this method, may you grant him the fruit of that [practiceW\"111' In the frame verses at the end of the sadhana, the sadhaka is assured that all female beings, celestial and human, will become his servants, and that after twdve years of constant practice, he will progress to mahamudri. and become a siddha. In a similar vein, another mahamudri. tat ends with the guarantee that \"he will wander about surrounded by women, like a lord of elephants [in rut] surrounded by bees. \"117 According to the methodology of mahamudri., women are necessary to the sadhaka because they are his chief soteriological tool. In the words of the guru at the time of initiation, \"She is an excellent ship that serves to cross over the water of the ocean of pas-sion.\"118 Just as a great herbal medicine that is delicious to the taste strikes down an illness, so the \"bliss of wisdom and means\" (the union of female and male) \"easily destroys the defilements. \"1\" To this end, no effon is eschewed that will heighten sensual experience. Physical beauty, fragrance, and sweet words are all employed. As the practices are enjoined at night (four times a month on the two founeenth-nights and eighth-nights, !44v6, v. 26), the yogin is instructed to use a lamp so that everything is illuminated, panicu-larly the details of the body. 190 The violent passion that accompanies sexual"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"92 VAJRAYOGINi rapture in classical Indian eroticology is put aside, and the couple are advised not to wound each other with their nails, lest they regret it later. 191 Although the practitioners do everything possible to enhance the sexual impulse, it is within a controlled context. The yogin is to make love to his conson, \"only for as long as his mind is not stirred up. \"1'2 An indirect com-ment on his skill in this respect is found in the visualization of the couple's consecration, which is granted at the hands of celestial beings including the two famous apsartUeS, Rambha and Tilottami. These nymphs often appear in Pu~ic myths in order to distract advanced sages from their development of tllpas when it is set to become a threat to the power of the gods. Their involvment in the consecration of a Buddhist yogin is a telling inversion of the Indian classical tradition. Its object is to prove that the sadhaka is able to manipulate the nymphs for his own ends rather than the other way around, and thus to demonstrate that his sexual love is under his command. 19-' The yogin's control over his mundane sexuality is achieved by one-pointed concentration upon the goal of his practice, sahaja bliss: \"The mind is fickle because of excessive movement; because it is motionless (niica/4Nit) [it becomes] the means (multham) of enlightenment. His mind set on [the bliss of] sahaja (sahajasaltttu~tma/J). he should make the goddess tremble in sexual play. \"I<H In the Hcvajra system followed by our author, sahaja bliss is understood to be the final stage in a series of four \"blisses\" or \"joys\" (anamlas). Each bliss arises at a panicular \"moment\" (lqa~). the final, highest bliss occurring at the moment said to be free of both passion and nonpassion (HT2.3.8: vilak,aT}Ilm). \"~The ultimate, sahaja bliss is described here as that final moment of intensity when he \"excites the goddess,\" but retains his own semen: 196 ( v. 90) The god and goddess should perform [the sexual move-ments of] churning and swinging (manthaNintlolanam)',., accord-ing to their own mudra (svamudra). But one should realize that sahaja bliss has arisen in the moment of vilale,aT_Ul. (v. 91) With his penis he should excite the goddess, and he should not emit his semen. If he emits his semen, how can there be great bliss? (v. 92) He should churn the ocean of the vagina through his desire for the ambrosia of sahaja. but in such a way that the poi-son (ltalalriifa'!') of passionlessness docs not arise. In these verses, the classical metaphor of\" churning the ocean\" is cleverly employed to place especial emphasis on the importance of passion."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINi IN INDIA 93 Whereas the devas and asuras churned the ocean of milk to produce both the nectar of immortality and mortal poison (lui1Aitu!4'!'), in contrast, the churning of sexual yoga should avoid the poison (passionlessness) and pro-duce only nectar (sahaja bliss). In an inversion of traditional Buddhist val-ues, tantric sexual yoga is based on the premise that there can be \"no greater sin than passionlessness\": \"In short, there is no place for passionlcssness in a buddha.\"1911 The erotic practices of the Guhyavajravildsinislklhana describe the process whereby Sllhaja bliss is transmuted into the soteriological goal of maha-mudra. The necessary basis of the yogin's erotic experience-as of all his experience-must be that of emptiness. This is a subject treated only cur-sorily here, however. 1\"' Instead, the recurring metaphor is of fusion and its power to induce the experience of nonduality. Thus, during the first of the \"nine kinds of sexual play\" (1UlvapUfPivv. 8<>-92), the yogin-deity is said to \"penetrate the body of his lover from head to toe. \"200 Once a classical love simile, the fusion referred to in this context is repeatedly shown to extend beyond the lovers' bodies to the macrocosm. The rays from the copulating goddess, or from her mantra, are of such intensity that they melt the three worlds into a single essence of blood, in the center of which the divine cou-ple is visualized making love.201 The sexual fusion is related to the yogic fusion of winds and drops. For example, during the \"pendulum recitation\" (Jo/4japab, Ksovs, vv. 102-o9) the couple is in union, each imagining the five blazing syllables ofVilasini's mantra circulating through their bodies. The syllables stan on the sex of the female consort (vitiya), enter the male via his penis, exit through his nos-tril, enter the viJyavia her nostril, and again pass into her sex. The mantra is recited up to five hundred times as it revolves through their united bod-ies, resulting in the fusion of nliJa and drop (bi,JW_,) within the internal bodily channels. This is followed by a repeated \"mutual sucking\" of the male and female sex. 2Q2 At the end of the pendulum recitation, the practioner imagines the \"fusion of their identities\" (atm~:t7nelaltab. K51r3, vv. no-14), and the three worlds are visualized whirling around like a wheel in the liq-uid form of purified gold \"blazing with the flavor of sameness,\" and cut-ting off the defilements of the world down to the most subde.~n Only then docs it become extinguished and dissolve like a rainbow into the ocean of space, upon which space itself dissoves into sahaja, \"the ocean of awaken-ing that brings great success. \"204 The text describing the yogic rituals ends with a Madhyamaka-type analysis of emptiness, in which reality is com-pared to dream experience because of its dependence upon causes (KSIVI,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"94 VAJRAYOGINi vv. 115-18). The experience of fusion, it suggests, is the correlative of the wis-dom of sameness: for the yogin who is concentrated on this fact [of non-duality], and \"steady in his continual practice of going to sameness,\" will become a siddha and have the great power of mahamudra.10~ Triktiyavajrayogini (Chinnamastti) The last manifestation of Vajrayogini to be discussed here is Trikaya-vajrayogini, \"triple-bodied Vajrayogini.\" She is also known as Chinnamasta, or Chinnamur:t9a-\"She Whose Head Is Severed\"-because she is visual-ized holding her own severed head in her hand. In our texts, however, the emphasis is not so much upon her severed head as upon her threefold nature, that is, Vajrayogini who manifests as three: the central deity plus two attendants named after the components of the tripartitite Vajrayogini mantra, Vajravairocani (right) and Vajravarr:tani (left); the central figure as a single deity is known as Sarvabuddha9akini (GSS27) or Sribuddha9akini (GSS24). Following Virupa's nomenclature, I shall therefore refer to this triple-bodied manifestation ofVajrayogini as Trilciyavajrayogini rather than Chinnamasta.~O(, (See fig. 23 and plate 9.)

There are significant differ-ences between the two sets of sources in the way the central form ofVajra-yogini is then to be visualized. In group I, the texts arc economical and focus their attention mainly on her stance. She is described as yellow in color and naked. Whether she should be seen with bone ornaments is there-fore ambiguous; the (slightly different) text of GSS24 docs prescribe them (which we follow in figure 23). Her legs are in the warrior (tilitjha!J) stance (GSS24), which Virupa's text docs not name but describes, \"with her right leg stretched out, and the left foot contracted\" (GSS25, cf. GSS2o, GSSs); in his stotras, however, he states that she is in the reverse warrior (pratya/ujha/1) stance. Most strikingly, the goddess is visualized holding \"her own head, chopped off with her own knife by herself.\" The left ann hold-ing the head is stretched up to her left, while her right arm holding the chopper points down diagonally in line with her outstretched right leg. From the goddess's decapitated torso, three streams ofblood arc seen gush-ing up into the air. The first spurts out of the central bodily channel, avaJhuti, and flows directly into the mouth of the severed head in her out-stretched hand. Blood from the channel on the left (/414na) and the chan-nel on the right (rasana) also streams out and enters the mouths of the two yogin is at her sides. 208 The attcndent yoginis are named as VajravaJl)ani to the left side of the central figure and Vajravairocani to the right. Vajravar~ani is a dark color, probably blue (GSS25 etc.: lyamavaJ?IIi'!'), or red (GSS24: ralttava'!'Ji'!'), and Vajravairocani is yellow. Each steps toward the central goddess, so that Vajravar1.1ani to the left stands in the pratylilUjhastancc, and Vajravairocani to the right stands in the alujha stance. Their attributes are the classic skull bowl and chopper of Vajrayogini, which they hold so that the chopper is on the outside, while the skull bowl is on the inside closest to the central figure. The attendant goddesses form mirror images of each other; they arc naked with loose hair, and \"between them, in space,\" the yogin is to visu-alize \"a very terrifying cremation ground\" (since the text is truncated, in fig-ure 23 we depict them wearing the bone ornaments, despite no prescriptions for this). MAll three deities are depicted in the IWS, according tO the Ri11 'byung brgya rtsJZ, in which Vajravar~ani is said to be green.210 In the second group of sources (GSS9-SM234-GSS3o), there is no men-tion at all of a severed head or of any other distinguishing feature. The fact that the goddess is a form ofTrikayavajrayogini can only be inferred from"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINIIN INDIA 97 the presence of the two attendant goddesses by her side and by the mantras that follow. Her generation is described, however, beginning at the heart from a multicolored /HI'!' that transforms into a multicolored lotus and cul-minating in the goddess Vajrayogini produced from a red hri'!' and seen having the color \"dark gold\" (lut1lllluzlydm41f1}-that is, red in color rather than yellow. 211 The ritual component of the practice is a puja. In both groups of sources, the worship involves offerings to an external m~4ala accompanied by an unusual sequence of offering mantras. The first sources relate how the yogin is to draw a square m~4ala upon the ground and then generate the god-dess through a sequence that mirrors the awakenings. Thus, a sun disk (a circle) is drawn inside the square, and a Jharmot/4yi triangle is drawn on top of the circle with the syllable hri'!' within. The sadhaka may then wor-ship either the seed-syllable or the iconographical form of the goddess, which he produces from the seed-syllable \"placing [her] down\" (tlropya) in the center of the triangle. m Having emanated the three goddess inside the Jha~ he is then to make offerings. The offerings proceed with the recitation of offering mantras. These form three sets, which are listed almost identically in all our sources, group I and group II (see table 7). The mantras for the shorter sadhanas (group II) include the color of the goddess to whom the offering is made, as well as the vocative mantric dement Vlljrap~-\"0 Vajra Flower!\" -suggesting that the mantras arc to be recited while offering a flower. m Other works prescribe either a fuller worship with traditional offerings or just with guest water.m Our sources also state where on the ~4ala the offering is to be made; that is, to the central goddess, or to the yogini on her left and right, so that in the course of the worship, all three goddesses are honored. (The allocations in group II, however, seem problematic.m) The worship ends with the final recitation of the japa {\"utterance\") mantra, which is the tri-panite root mantra ofVajrayogini.216 The object of the first set of mantras is to worship the triple nature of Trikayavajrayogini. The set opens with the tripartite japa mantra, which praises T rikayavajrayogini as three deities in one. Individual offerings arc then made to her in her three aspects, namdy, to the central deity as Sarva-buddhaQakini, to the dark lefthand deity VarJJani, and to the yellow right-hand deity Vairocani. Having recited all three sets of offering mantras, the yogin may then make a final offering to Trikayavajrayogini (in GSS2.s and in group II), which seems to be another all-embracing mantra to her as three-in-one.

In the T riltayavajrayoginistotra (GSS27), Vajrayogini is said to be established within each channel in turn, and to manifest in each with a particular color17 and a particular iconography:211 (v. 2cd) In the central portion of this [dharmodayd-triangle] is the syllable hri1fl, which is described as yellow in color. (v. 3) [Trikayavajrayogini] arises from it and is [also] yellow. She is by nature (svaya,)siruated in the avadhUti, but in /a/ana she is very dark, and in rasanii she has a white [color]. (v. 4) In the middle she is in the pratydlitjha stance, naked, and charming in [her] yellow [color]. [Thus] the goddess Trikayavajrayogini is estab-lished in the three channels. (v. s) This [goddess] as a single [god-dess] is called Sarvabuddha9akini. Vajrayogini's threefold nature is also extolled in the other Trilulyavajra-yoginistotra (GSS26) in which it becomes the central moti£ Thus, she inhab-its sky, eanh, and the underworld, and makes the triple world tremble (v. 4); she is without dissolution or arising but is the agent of both (v. 7). The unification of her threefold nature into a single goddess represents the yogic goal of great bliss, the result of the conjunction of winds in the central channel: \"Through the conjuction of 14/ana and rasa1111, she is avadhiti, great bliss. \"219 This gives rise to a fourth category, namely, the unified, tran-scendent aspect of the threefold system. For example, Vajrayogini has the dot (bintlup), the subde sound (1111Jtzb), and the moon segment (JuJd), (v. sa) and yet she passes beyond them (GSS26 K93VI, v. 6a: bintlu1Ui441tlll4titli). The stotra goes on to identify Vajrayogini with the four moments and blisses of the Hevajra system (v. 9cd) and the four bodies of the Buddha (v. scd).120 In the sadhanas, this fourth, transcendent aspect is represented by the uni-lateral mantra offering to the complete maJ]4ala, the goddess unified as \"one-in-three.\" The second set of mantra offerings includes the name of four sites: 049iyana, Piiri]agiri, Kamakhya (= Kamariipa), and Srihana (Syllhet in modern Bangladesh). This is reminiscent of the body maJ]4ala, in which the Cakrasarpvara/V ajravarahi maJ]4ala is understood to comprise twenty-four sites (pi!has) within the three worlds (ch. 3). Of those twenty-four sites, however, only 044iyana appears in the maJ]4ala of T rikayavajrayogini; indeed, this fourfold set seems to have been unique.221 With the recitation"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINIIN INDIA 101 of these offering mantras, the yogin identifies the three goddesses with the first three sites, and the central goddess again (presumably as the transcen-dent \"founh\") with the founh site. The same procedure is followed for the third set of offering mantras, which identify the goddesses with the bodies of the Buddha. Similar cor-relations are seen in the Sa,.varoe/4yatllntra (ch. 4, vv. 2.1Cd-2.7), in which the triadic yogic structure is identified with many different external triads, including both the triple world and the Buddha's three bodies, and where it is said that by realizing the correlation between the outer and inner tri-ads, the yogin attains buddhahood (v. 27cd). The goals of the Trikiyavajrayogini practice are enumerated chiefly in terms of the magical powers (siddhis) accrued. The L~Jqmis4Jha1111 describes the rewards of mantra recitations in the prior service (piirvtlsnNi): one /41th (one hundred thousand) calms obstructive spirits, two 14/thsattract women, three 14/ths conquer cities, four 14/ths attraa the king and five lalths bring the practitioner whatever he desires (GSS24 K9ov6-91r, cf. Benard 1994: 72-74). Liberationist goals are not forgotten, however, and the stotra describes the goddess's power of liberating the practitioner \"from the bonds of the oceans of existence. \"222 Unusually, liberation is also the stated goal of the bAli offerings that end the sadhana practices. The bali mantra in the Viriipa-based Trikiyavajrayogini sadhanas (group 0 is the only mantra in the GSS that States that it is \"for enlightenment\" (sll1f'Y'IItstnp~). 223 The &ct that siddhi is not clearly distinguished from liberation in these texts is a reflection ofVajrayogini's supramundane status. Siddhi and liberation are the same in that both are realized by cleansing the mind of the obscu-rarions that give rise to dual appearances. This is demonstrated by the icono-graphical symbolism ofTrikiyavajrayogini's severed head. By chopping off her own head and surviving to drink her own blood, the goddess dramati-cally declares that she has transcended the world of dual appearances. The motif of self-decapitation runs through other works in the highest tantras; indeed, it is not an uncommon theme in Indian mythology in gen-eral. 224 For example, one Tibetan hagiography of Kir}hapa/Kffl}icarya describes how his two pupils, the yoginis Mekhali and Kanakhali, are chal-lenged to cut off their heads in a bid to conven the king. This they happily undertake, before dancing headless into space and disappearing into rain-bow light. Taranitha says that their actions started a head-chopping trend among cJ.ikinis and that as an antidote Vajravirihi herself appeared with a severed head among her devotees. m The princess I...alqmiilkari also used the device to prove to her father that in becoming the conson of her brother"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"102 VAJRAYOGINi Indrabhuti, she was innocent of an incestous relationship. She chopped off her head and walked around the city while white blood flowed from her neck, after which the citizens called her ChinnatnUI).Qa Varahi. 2u. For such adepts, the severing of their own heads usually indicates the severing of defilements. Thus, Ga~ppopa' s final realization comes when he has a dream in which his head is cut off and rolls down a hill, symbolizing that his ugrasping the idea of a self\" (litmagrahll/1) is severed (Benard 1994: 96). The • SiJdha-Amnliya makes the same point, in a rather different fash-ion, when Advayavajra attempts to prove his mastery of appearances by temporarily decapitating his friend. He fails because he had not purified his mind of conceptualization (*SiJJha-Amnliya p. 11.26: viltalpllsa,bhutat-wit). Self-decapitation~r the breaking of some other fundamental Bud-dhist precept-therefore represents a moment of crisis. Thus, it is only when Advayavajra is about to cut off his head in despair at ever finding his guru that Sahara appears ( *SiJdha-Amnliya p. 11.22). Similarly, Nampa's guru appears only after he has decided to cut his veins with a razor (Guen-ther 1963: 36). In the AriiJhtznavidhi above (GSS23), Sahara's failure leads him to doubt the truth of the lord's words, whereupon the goddess finally appears and tells him it is his own obscurations that are to blame. When Virupa' s practice of Vajravarahi was fruitless, he was driven to throwing his rosary down the toilet, whereupon Vajravirahi appeared, and set him on the path that led him ultimately to enlightenment (Dowman 1985: 43-52). In these accounts, it is only by reaching a breaking point that the yogin breaks through his defilements. By confronting his limitations in that crucial moment, he removes his final obscurarions and gains access to the transcendent realm he has so dearly sought. Conclusions We have now seen a variety of forms ofVajrayogini and Vajravarahi, all of which reflect the luiplililta and/ or Jti!ttA and yogic concerns of the highest Buddhist tantras. It remains to be asked whether we can tell anything of the origins and direction of the cult from our survey. Do the various manifes-tations present a dynamic picture of the cult ofVajrayogini in a process of evolution and development; or do they instead represent a number of dis-tinct if overlapping sytems, so that it would be more appropriate to talk of the Vajrayogini \"cults\" rather than of a single tradition?"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINi IN INDIA 103 The main feature that unifies the many manifestations ofVajrayogini is the mantra, which, despite certain variants, revolves around the three epi-thets or mantra-deities, sarvabuJJhat/4/tini. vajraVIl'?'Jlni, and vajravairo-cani. Vajravairocani is the deity of Vajrayogini's heart mantra, and Sarvabuddha4ikini and Vajravar-:tani of her auxiliary heart mantra. The three combine in the root mantra: 01JI 01JI 01JI sarvabuJJhat/4}tiniyt vajraVIl'?'JlniJt vajravairocaniyt hu'!' hu'!' hu'!' pha! pha! phil! svdha None of these mantra deities occurs commonly by itself. In the Trikiya-vajrayogini visualization they are given iconographical form as external representations of the three inner channels of the body, but apart from this, there is only one other mention of an independent separate goddess based on the mantra epithets. This is Vajravairocani, who appears in a rather suprising statement in the Abhisamayamllfijari in which (having just prescribed the visualization ofVajravarahi as a solo deity) the author comments, \"Furthermore, the goddess Vajravairocani is called Vajra-yogini, and according to the scriptures and the teaching, there arc many differences in the transmission. \"22' This seems to reflect the idea that once Vajraviri.hi appears outside her Cakrasarpvara-based ma-:tcJa1a, she may take on a different form (in this instance, that of Vajravairocani) and is perceived as a manifestation of the generic deity, Vajrayogini. How, then, did this identification between the two goddesses Vajravarahi and Vajra-yogini come about? Any attempt to look for the origins of the cult through the textual sources on hand can be little more than conjccrurc. We can, however, sec two emer-gent trends at work in the Jaltta cults of the highest Buddhist tantras, and these seem to converge within Vajrayogini tradition. One trend is the emer-gence of a Buddhist yogini (a vajra-yogini) with Vajrayogini herself as the generic representative of that group. We have seen this same tendency at work in the forms of goddesses who represent particular classes of female, as in the attendant goddesses on the four petals, l)ikini or Lama, and pos-sibly in the emergence of a single goddess called Vajravilasini. We also noticed Vajrayogini appearing as the esscntialized form of other female deities, such as Ekaja!i and Buddha4akini. The other trend is the rise of the solitary heroine Vajraviri.hi. We have seen how Vajraviri.hi gravitated from the outer reaches of Heruka m~qalas toward the center, to appear, on"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"104 VAJRAYOGINI occasion, as consort to Hevajra, and then as chief lady in the Cakrasatpvara system. Finally, as Buddhism absorbed the impact of laltta Saivism, Vajra-varahi assumed greater significance still and rose to the position of m~Qala­leader within her own all-female m~4ala. In this context, Vajravirihi appropriated the m~Qala and ritual systems of her former consort, and her own cult developed. These two trends converge as Vajravarahi is identified with Vajrayogini. The process seems natural enough. As the former con-sort of the deity, Cakrasarpvara, Vajravarahi is an outstanding example of a vajra-yogini and easily associated with the essentialized form of all vajra-yoginis, Vajrayogini herself. Whatever the factor that drew Vajravarahi into Yajrayogini' s fold, once inside, she had a formative influence on the cult. First, she brought several different manifestations with her. For example, the dancing arrJhaparyanlut-pose form of Vajravirahi with the protruding hog's head may have pre-dated that of Vajravarahi as Calcrasarpvara' s consort, since she still bears her eponymous hog's head, which the consort does not. There also seems to be a tradition of the hog-headed forms ofVajravarihi belonging to the buddha family of Alqobhya, rather than to the presiding deity of Vajra-varahi in the Cakrasa!Jlvara mat.t4aJa, V airocana. A Tibetan source states that the hog-headed Vajravirahi is presided over by Alqobhya (n. 122); and the entirely hog-headed Vajragho~a Vajravarihi, a goddess present in the ma~4alas of the Y amari herukas, is also presided over by Alqobhya. As we have seen, the VajraghoQa form may have been emerging in its own right as the popularity of the wider cult grew, and this in itself hints at broader trends within the cults of female deity worship in India. Amid their ever-expanding pantheons, we find another popular hog-headed goddess: Marid, in her many forms. The interweaving of the Vajrayogini and Vajravirahi traditions might also explain the iconographical difference we noted between the manifes-tations that hold a chopper and those that hold a vajra. In the main, the chopper belongs to forms of Vajrayogini, and to the arrJhaparyan/ta.-pose Vajravarahi. The vajra generally belongs to warrior-stance forms of Yajravarahi. The chopper may then be associated with the \"older\" forms of the yogini-type goddess who was later essentialized as Yajrayogini, while the vajra may date from Cakrasarpvara' s embrace ofVajravirahi as his consort. The merging of once separate forms may also explain discrepancies within the mantras. Not all sadhanas prescribe the tripartite root mantra of the Vajrayogini tradition, and there are some exceptional mantras based on the mantra deities Vajravarahi, Vajra4akini, and Vajrayogini. For example,"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINIIN INDIA 105 the mantra deity Vajravarahi is included in the mantra utterance for the three forms ofVajravirihi: the VajraghoJ}i forms, the six-armed embrac-ing Vajravirihi, and a warrior-stance Vajravirihi (in GSS2. KitvJ). We also find the same mantra deities, Vajra4aJcini and Vajrayogini, in mantras rdat-ing to the warrior-stance form ofVajrayogini with a chopper, and to both the raised-leg-pose goddesses, white Vajrayogini, and red Vajravirahi. It seems to be Vajravirihi-as-consort who bequeathed the tripartite root mantra to the Vajrayogini tradition. The mantra clement Sarvabud-dhaQikini appears in the Cakrasarpvara texts in the auxiliary heart mantra ofVajravarahi (e.g., ADliT ch. 14, p. 2.88: O'fl sarvalnuJJhtuj4/tin~ hu'!' hu'fl pha! nNihi), and the inclusive nature of this epithet sarvtllnu/Jhat!4ltini (\"cJikini of all the buddhas\") is a testimony to Vajravirihi's importance as consort to Cakrasarpvara and may have been another &ctor in equating her with the generic form ofVajrayogini. The epithet \"Vajravairocani\" proba-bly arose because in the Cakrasarpvara maQ4a}a Vajravirihi is assigned to the buddha family ofVairocana. I have found no clear directions as to the origins of the third epithet, vajrava'?'4ni. Although the three mantra epi-thets do not seem to have referred to separate forms of the goddess in the first instance, they may have acquired such status over time, as suggested by Sakyaralqita' s (relativdy late) reference above to a solo form of Vajra-varahi called Vajravairocani. The same devdopment seems to have affected the epithet sarvab~ni in later traditions. In Indian sources, I have not seen an independent goddess called SarvabuddlwJakini attested outside the Trikiyavajrayogini sidhanas. However, a deity iconographically identi-cal with warrior-stance, chopper-widding Vajrayogini is referred to, on occasion, in Tibetan sources as Sarvabuddha4ikini, or Sangs rgyas thams cad kyi mkha' 'gro ma (e.g., von Schroeder 1981: plate 111E), although this seems rare. In fact, the appellation \"Sarvabudclha4akini• may be something of a Western usage, perhaps originating in a misreading of the 54Jhan41Ni/4 sidhanas ofTrik.iyavajrayogini.221 Another feature of the practice of Vajrayogini in India is the tendency to associate panicular forms of the goddess with charismatic founders of a lineage. This seems to have taken hold in Tibet, where there are three main transmissions of the goddess. As we have seen, lndrabhuti is associated with the transmission of the dancing artihllparyanltll form ofVajravarahi with hog's head, Indra-khccari (mKha' spyoti); Advayavajra/Maitripi(da) with the raised foot (u~) form ofVidyadhari Vajrayogini, known in Tibet as \"Maitri-khccari\"; and finally, Naropa with the classic warrior-stance form of Vajravarahi, Na-ro-khccari."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"106 VAJRAYOGINi Although the transmissions were oral to begin with, we have seen how their \"textualization\" occured very early. In a traditional Buddhist enviro-ment, this would have little affect on the esoteric nature of the worship and the still-primary role of the guru in granting intiation into the praaices. (This remains true even today. As Lama Jampa Thaye put it [2002: per-sonal communication], \"[The practices] remain 'secret' in as much as we cannot study or praaise them without the requisite initiations and trans-missions--although one may, of course, possess the books.\" In other quar-ters, with the popular appeal of tantric Buddhism to Westerners and the willingness of Tibetan lamas to cater to that, the traditional structures no longer hold true. This situation has, of course, provided a rationale or jus-tification for academics, who argue that if such information is to appear in the public domain, then it may as well be accurate and subject to the schol-arly methods of the academy.) In conclusion, our survey of the Vajrayogini tradition in this chapter has revealed the general unity of the cult: Its mantras are relatively stable, and most forms of the goddess receive the generic labeling \"Vajrayogini.\" How-ever, it has also indicated the existence of separate currents within the tra-dition, based on its historical roots and the influence of separate teachers. The two main streams in the tradition center on the goddesses Vajravarahi and Vajrayogini, and it is perhaps unsurprising that some forms in the Guhyasam4Jasddhanamli/4 have been seen to draw on both these traditions. Thus, the raised-foot-pose goddesses manifest as a form of white Vajra-yogini and as a form of red Vajravarahi; the same is true ofVilasini, who in one manifestation is related to Vajravarahi and in another to the Vidyadhari Vajrayogini; and both traditions are found to merge in the prac-tice of the turtle-stance Vajrayogini. This suggests that such forms are later developments in the cult, able to draw upon a mature iconographical stock. Is it possible, then, to trace the evolution of the cult from our analysis of its contexts? It seems fairly certain that an early stage would be the defini-tion of the solitary heroine (tltavirli) within an all-female mat}4a}a based on the Cakrasaqtvara system. This may have encouraged the identification of Vajravarahi with the generic goddess Vajrayogini and the proliferation of her forms in their terrifying anclJor erotic aspects. Our analysis ofU mapatideva' s Vajravtirtihi Stidhana will also shown an increasing cremation-ground ori-entation within these praaices, one of which is taken further still in the \"skeleton arch\" praaices (GSS32-34). Here, the tradition seems to draw on forms of Vajrayogini that survive in earlier tantric praaices, and also from"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE CULT OF VAJRAYOGINi IN INDIA 107 sources that lie outside the main Herukatantra traditions, namdy from eso-teric Saivism and perhaps from less influential portions of the Buddhist tantras. Finally-or perhaps simultaneously-we see specialist practices emerging from within these different streams of the Vajrayogini tradition, as in the practices that reject the lttipti/ilta culture altogether and cultivate the erorico-yogic soteriology of mahimudra. The impressive number of forms in which Vajrayogini manifests and the variety of her praaices together reflect the richness and popularity of her cult in the land of its birth. According to tradition, of course, such diver-sity simply illustrates the power of the goddess's compassion and her mas-tery of skillful means as she caters to differences in \"the character and disposition\" of beings.229 Seen in this light, and despite all our efforts, any study of the goddess could only ever reveal a fraaion of her true nature--for as the Abhisamayamaiijari points out, Vajrayogini's manifestations are, in reality, infinite:2JO So one should understand the transmissions of the goddess such as these that have come down (ayatti) in the lineage of pupils from the teachings of the siddhas to be endless, because of the [endless] differences in the dispositions of those to be trained.

It opens and closes with the usual frame verses, prescribes the practitioner's prdiminary actions, and then progresses to the yogin's generation of himself as Vajravirihi. Ritual and yogic procedures are then mentioned in brief, and it ends, as is standard in a sadhana, with the repetition of the deity's mantra. The second meditation stage is brief, as it simply prescribes the visualiza-tion of a fivefold JJW}cJala, that is, the central deity, Vajravarahi, on the 109"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"IIO VAJRAYOGINi pcricarp of the lotus, surrounded by four more goddesses on the four main petals of the pericarp.

The fourth meditation stage goes on to supply the goddesses of the twenty-four sites (pi!fJas) situated upon the three maJ]9ala circles that surround the central petal in concentric rings; this brings the mar:tc:Jala to its complete thirty-seven-fold form. For each meditation stage, Umapati-deva prescribes the necessary mantras for the attendant goddesses, as well as additional mantras for the central deity. Upon completing the maJ]9ala, meditation stage four also describes the contemplative practices to be undertaken upon the basis of the full visualization. The full maJ]9ala is shown in figure 32 (related to plate 12). Umapatideva's neat organization of the details of the practice serves a didactic purpose. It enables him to clarify the methods for each visualiza-tion associated with the full maJ]9ala, and to offer each stage as a complete visualization in itself. Importantly, he is able to distinguish the mantras associated with the central deity at each stage. Other authorities on the maJ]9ala follow the more usual method, which is to prescribe the progres-sive visualization of mal}<;iala deities staning at the central pericarp and moving outward, thus: mar:t9ala leader(s) on lotus pericarp --+ goddesses on surrounding lotus petals --+ goddesses of the twenty-four sites --+ outer goddesses. This is the structure of the sixty-two-fold Cakrasatpvara mar:tc:Jala as pre-sented in Liiyipada's HmJtabhisamaya; and it is the structure of the other complete Vajravirihi mar:t9ala in the Guhyasamayasadhanama/a collection, the Abhisamayamaftjari (GSSs) by Salcyaralqita, which is also closely based on Cakrasatpvara sources. In this lengthy work (summarized in the appen-dix), the Abhisamayamaftjariuses this progressive method to introduce the entire sadhana for the generation of the thirty-seven-fold mar:tc:tala, from its preliminary procedures to its closing rites. Only then does it offer alter-native practices. The first alternative describes a fivefold mar:t9ala \"for those wanting a medium-length version\" (K33vs: Wlllllhyaruds tu ... ), as in U mapatideva' s second meditation stage.

It is standard that authors prescribe rit-ual procedures such as external worship at the end of a sadhana, as the sadhana is actually a preliminary to the rites-indeed to all activity-that the practitioner is to undertake in his new divine form. However. Uma-patideva is particularly careful to separate the rites from the body of the sadhana, which enables him to preserve the narrative Aow of the four med-itation stages. For example, in the first meditation stage he simply points out in passing the moment when the tasting of nectar ritual is to be per-formed (v. 2.8b), but he reserves the actual procedures for the later section that deals specifically with ritual practices (v. 59ff.). In this way, the ritual practices as given in U mapatideva' s sadhana form a kind of extended"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"ll2 VAJRAYOGINi \"ritual epilogue\" to the main body of the work. This structure allows Umapatideva to include other rites that may or may not be performed at the same time as the sadhana, such as the bali ritual and various external worship ceremonies, and it demonstrates that the rites may be performed using the visualization of the maJ.I<Jala in any of its four stages. The same clarity of exposition is evident in Umapatideva's treatment of other mate-rial that is tangential to the main thrust of the meditation. Thus, he inserts the alternative visualization of the circle of protection at the end of the first meditation stage (v. 35), and details of the cremation grounds at the very close of the sadhana (vv. ?o-?6). The lucid structural framework of the Vajravarlihi SaJhana is matched by an elegance of style. In contrast to the formulaic Sanskrit prose and occasional \"doggerel\" (usually anUftubh) of much sadhana literature, Umapatideva employs the somewhat more poetic meter upajati. The first meditation stage comprises thirty-five of Umapatideva's own verses with additional prose passages redacted from other texts to expand upon the terse prescriptions of the verse. For the description of the full ~<Jala in the second, third, and fourth meditation stages, U mapatideva draws from a stock of source material (discussed below) and thus employs a combina-tion of anU!_tubh and prose. He concludes the sadhana with a return to his own verses in upajati to explain the visualization of the cremation grounds and to close his composition with the dedication of merit. Within the clas-sical conventions that mold his verses, Umapatideva sets the prescriptive tone of the sadhana in the traditional fashion with the use of optative finite verbs applying to the sadhaka (\"he should visualize,\" \"he should perform,\" etc.), while his metrical reworking of the older material means that he avoids many stock descriptions found elsewhere in the Vajrayogini litera-ture. Nevertheless, in refining familiar phrases (for example, in his descrip-tion ofVajravarahi, vv. 19-24), it seems as if he is consciously aiming to preserve the flavor of the older passages-no doubt as a mark of respect for the tradition he sets out to describe."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"MEDITATION STAGE I Bnudiction v. 1 The sadhana opens in traditional fashion with a verse of benediction (mangalttm). This takes the form of an expression of obeisance and hom-age (namasltira/J) ro the chosen deity of the practice (~)and gives voice to the devotion felt by the author. Our author, Umapatidcva, begins by saluting the lotuslike foot of the vajra goddess, which-in true poetic (luivya) style-suggests both her extraordinary beauty and his inability to describe more than a single feature of so awe-inspiring a whole. Hinting per-haps at the goddess's dance, Umapatidcva praises the divine qualities of such a foot, which is capable of destroying dichotomizing consciousness and engendering the realization of emptiness. For comparison, here are the bencdictory verses to the other major sadhana ofVajravarahi in the Guhya-SIImllJilSiitlhll1lll1Nil4, the AbhisamllJilmafijari (GSSs). These include a brief namasluirafollowed by a prayer (aiirvtitJ4b)for the deity's favor. Once again, salient features of the composition are highlighted, in this case, the mani-fold nature ofVajrayogini's forms and her evident compassion:23' Homage to Vajrayogini, whose nature is emptiness and compassion, who has manifold forms because of the diverse natures of people, who is irradiated by brightness (vaiiatiya-), because she is thoroughly cleansed (suJhavana) by the nectar (suJha) of perfect enlightenment, quiescent (ftlntli) though she is [within], without she spreads redness because of her affection for the multitude of those to be trained. Bearing a vajra, a stainless skull bowl, and a skull staff of terrible splendor, may this blessed Vajravilasini bring you prosperity! The composition of a sadhana is a rdigious undenaking and is therefore framed by bencdictory verses at the start, and, in the final verse, with a ded-ication of the merit gained by completing the task.

Preliminari~ v. :z. Umapatideva's second verse describes the necessary preliminaries to the sadhana: finding a suitable site in which to practice and sitting down to meditate. The verse begins by dictating the type of spot the yogin should choose for meditation. The ideal places are wild and solitary, \"pleasing to the heart\" (v. 2c) of a tantric sadhaka because they are \"suitable to prac-tice. \"Hl While huts and temples are also listed in other yoginitantra texts, this is not typical of the Vajrayogini tradition. Indeed, on the two occasions where indoor dwelling places are mentioned in the GuhyasamayasaJhaM-mdla (amid more terrifying alternatives), they are said to be desened; Vajrayogini practices clearly follow the most extreme wing of the Buddhist tradition. m This is in stark contrast to the siitra-type sadhanas (such as many in the SiidhaMmlila collection) that prefer quiet resorts or temple shrines as sites for meditation, \"delightful\" (m~mohttra) because they are beautified with fragrant water and flowers, and free of disturbances such as robbers, noise, or thorns. 234 Having chosen the site for his meditation, the yogin then sits himself down \"on a very comfortable scat, with yogic ease\"-StitihaMmdlasources speak of soft cushions and tender pillows. m Vajrayogini texts occasionally mention two other types of seat. One is \"made of a double vajra\" (vifva-vajramayi-). which suggests a double vajra (fig. 26) drawn or embroidered onto a cushion or decorative hanging, or traced upon the ground; the other consists of a corpse. 2-'6 Once seated, the yogin assumes his meditation pos-ture, probably the traditional cross-legged pose (paryan/uz!llvajra-paryankab). which seems to be the commonest position prescribed in the SaJhaMTNila. 231 In a passage that lists a number of seated meditation pos-tures, Abhayakaragupta explains the vajraparyanka thus: \"Having placed the left foot between the right calf and thigh, he should place the right [over the left] between the left calf and thigh. This is the vajraparyanlta [posture].\"m Far more complex preliminary activities are prescribed elsewhere, and the yogin would undoubtedly wish to undertake a number of these before con-tinuing. To start with, he would usually enact rituals for the protection of \"place, person, and practice,\" which may involve time-consuming external"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHi SADHANA 115 rites and internal meditations, or simply be accomplished by reciting 07JI ti/;J hii,. l)9 For the \"protection of the place,\" sadhanas usually prescribe a bali rit-ual, injunctions for which appear later in the Vajravardhi StiJhana (v. 66fT.). This can be a very complex rite in which a special propitiatory food offer-ing-a bali-is offered to local spirits, as well as to the deities of the ~~a. Alternatively, the site may be empowered by the utterance of a sequence of mantras performed with the appropriate hand gestures, or mudras.240 The \"protection of the person, involves the purification of the practi-tioner's body, speech, and mind. Many sadhanas begin with bodily purifi-cation. The yogin is instructed to rise early (pratar iitthaya ... ), \"when the night has 'one hour and a half (artihayama) remaining\" (or, according to Saiva ritual tats, \"within two hours before dawn\").241 He is then to wash his mouth and perform other ablutions such as going to the toilet (multha-lauctiJi/ta-), which he ritualizes by reciting mantras and maintaining the conviction that as he washes, he is being consecrated by the buddhas. 2•2 For the purification of speech (vagvilwldhiJ,J), the Abhisamayamafljari (GSSs) prescribes a threefold recitation of the syllables of the alphabet. The syllables represent the undifferentiated mantric form of the deities. They are visualized forming three circles around the meditator as the three circles (cakras) of the maJ]~a (see below), while light rays shine from the syllables and transform into a mass of deities who destroy all the obstacles impeding the practice. The vagviiutJJhi, which is referred to several times in the GuhyasllmllJasatlhanamii/a, is derived from Cakrasarpvara literature. The longest version, although still confusingly terse, is found in the AbhisllmllJilmafljari. (The alphabet is shown in plate r6a from ms. K.):W \"o'!'

This is the purification of speech (vagvilwldhip)."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"n6 VAJRAYOGINI The purification of mind-in fact, of body, speech, and mind alto-gether-is achieved with another preparatory ritual found in the higher tantras. This is the contemplation of the purifying correspondences ( viiutJ-dhis)-a method of establishing, or reestablishing, the yogin in union with the deity. Indeed, one Cakra.sarpvara text specifically prescribes it as a pre-liminary for a yogin who has lost the awareness of himself as the deity. 2<44 The purification takes place on the basis that the yogin understands every part of his psychophysical being-viz. his five aggregates (sluznJhas), the sense organs with their respective sense fields (ayataNIS), and the five ele-ments (dhatus}-to be ontologically equivalent to the buddhas, because all share the nature of emptiness. Although this preparatory practice is not found in the Vajraviiriihi SdJhana (possibly because it includes the visual-ization of male deities), it is worth describing here because of its similarity to the armoring stage later in the sadhana. Our source is the Abhis~tmaya-1111liijari, and is again clearly based upon Cakra.sarpvara sources. It intro-duces the visualization as follows:24~ He should be firmly convinced (adhimuli«t) of the purifying correspondence[s] for the skandhas and the rest [of his psy-chophysical being] since (iti) [rites] such as worship [that are performed] on the basis of the purified skandhas, etc., arc a speedy cause of enlightenment. Of these, [the buddhas] Vairo-cana and so on [i.e., Ratnasarpbhava, Amitibha, Amoghasiddhi, and Vajrasattva (sic)] arc firmly understood (nilctyii/1) as [the skandhas,] \"form\" up to and including \"consciousness,\" by vinue of [both the buddhas and the skandhas] being like foam, bubbles, rays of light, the plantain plant, [or] illusions, [i.e., empty]. Alqobhya [is understood] as tllthata. Alternatively it is simply the firm belief in Vairocana and the other deities that constitutes the purification of those [skandhas etc.]. The text then correlates each buddha individually with the skandhas, and describes the iconographical forms they are to assume as the meditator con-templates the correspondences. The buddhas assume a typically tantric appearance as they stand in the warrior (iilitjha/J) stance, with three eyes, matted locks, and bearing the five signs of observance (muJrtis). They hold tantric attributes \"gracefully\" (udila) in their right hands, and place their left \"proudly\" (s~tgarva) upon their girdles full of bells. Next, the meditator correlates his sense organs and sense fields with"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 117 another set of deities who are the esoteric equivalents of the above: ~iti­garbha, Vajrapil}i, Khagarbha, Lokdvara, Sarvani~av~kambhin, and Samantabhadra. They are visualized holding an attribute in their right hands and a bdl in their left. The author also provides alternative names that reflect their capacity to destroy the poisons: \"Mohavajra because he destroys ignorance (mohfl/1), ~vajra because he is the enemy of malice (tivqa};), the three Iqya[vajra], Raga[vajra], and Matsaryavajra because they destroy [respectively] envy {i\"!J'i), all clinging (sarvasangfl/1), and miserli-ness (mlitsa'J'Im), and Ai$varyavajra because he bestows all powers. \"246 Finally, the yogin equates the four elements with the four goddesses Patani, MaraJ]i, .A.kaqa!]i, and Narte5vari, and the element space with Padmajvalini. They also assume a ltapalilta form, and are visualized naked, with loose hair, holding tantric attributes in their four arms, while the fifth goddess has three faces and six arms. The text states that the goddesses are also known as Locana, Mamaki, Pi.l]4ara, Tara, and Dharmadharuvajra, namely, the traditional consorts of the buddhas and \"mothers\" of the yogatantra systems. 247 These correlations and the salient iconographical fea-tures are summarized in table 9· One other preparatory rite is worth mentioning, as it illustrates the purification of the praaitioner's body, speech, and mind through trans-gressive discipline (vimticira/1). This is the mantra bath (mantrasnanam), which is performed using forbidden substances, such as alcohol, and con-ventionally \"disgusting\" bodily secretions and fluids. The praaice forces the yogin to break through his instinaive, dualistic perception of matter as either pure or impure, and in so doing the transgressive substances become nectars capable of purifying his body, speech, and mind. This practice appears almost identically in the first two sadhanas of the GuhyllSil7NlJIZ-satiha1UI1Nilll, attributed to lndrabhiiti (GSS1) and Liiyipada (GSS2):241 Next, in order to purify the body, speech, and mind, he should [take] the three (GSS2: four) kinds of divine liquid according to their availability, [namely, fomentations from] honey (GSSI: mlilihvi; GSS2: m.rtlvilti and mlitlhviltli), molasses (gawJi), [and] flour (paqp) and mix them with the five nectars [namely, semen, blood, flesh, urine, and feces] and place them in a chalice.

The preliminaries pave the way for this inner process. Her fondness for cremation grounds and mountainous haunts is reflected in the lists of possible meditation sites. Her iconography is mirrored by the meditator's seat, as she stands above a m~4ala resting upon a crossed vajra (viJvavajrav~dika), and upon a corpse throne. Her posture, too, may be imitated by the practitioner, as one bali ritual directs him to assume her actual pose, standing upon raised ground in warrior stance, naked, with loose hair and eyes raised (GSS31). He may also model his appearance upon that of the goddess, either by going naked with loosened hair, or by donning red hair band and red clothes in order to emulate her color. 24'~ Practices based on the purifying correspondences or upon transgressive discipline prepare the yogin by reaffirming his under-standing of nonduality, and paving the way for his inner identification with the deity who is a reflex of that reality. Taken as a whole, the prelim-inaries demonstrate the same objectives as the sadhana: the yogin's ongo-ing attempt to erode his perception of himself as a mundane individual and to reconstitute himself as Vajravarahi. In the complex array of preliminary procedures, the ancient Indian adage is at play, that \"one must become a god to worship a god. \"2~ Bodhisattva Preparations v. 3-The next portion of the sadhana lays the spiritual foundations for the §2. yogin's transformation into the deity.

The Vttjravarahi StiJhant1 follows the method standard in mainstream sadhanas, which is to cultivate a more speedy accumulation of merit through the praaices of worship and the brllhmllvihara meditations, and a more instant accumulation of wisdom through the contemplation of emptiness.2~1 It is to the former that Umapatidcva now turns in the fol-lowing verses and prose portions. Worship v. 3 The worship is based on the Mahayana supreme worship (anunarapuja) in seven stages and includes both the visualization of offerings and the recitation of verses. The first step is to make abundant offerings to crowds of celestial beings. The yogin begins by visualizing a glowing red Vll7fl {t) in his heart, the seed-syllable ofVajravirihi in her most essential form. The syllable quivers and shines with an intense spiritual energy and emits light rays that stream through all the pores of the meditator's body before \"drawing down\" ( alta\"!41_Ulm) the deities to be worshiped. Rays are a typ-ical tool of a visualization meditation. They are a reflex of the power of the deity, capable of pervading the entire universe, purifying it, removing its suffering, and nourishing it. Sometimes they take the form of a hook or goad (anltuiab) that \"urges\" or \"impels\" (sa'!' v cuJ) the deities to coop-erate in the ritual. m In the Vajravarlihi SM/hana (v. 3d), the rays draw down \"a mass of buddhas and so on\" from their dwelling place in the Akani,!ha heaven, where they reside in a body of enjoyment (sa'!'bhoga-ltayah). m A characteristic list of the beings to be worshiped includes \"gurus, buddlw, and bodhisattVas\" (e.g., v. 6a: prv4dibhif1).2S4 The prece-dence shown here to the guru is a reminder of his centrality within the tantric systems and his supreme significance to the yogin, who views him as the chosen deity itself. Some yoginitantra texts, however, supplant even the guru by introducing the yoginis at the head of the list (yoginiguru-buJJhabodhisltttva-). This is effectively what happens in the worship sec-tion of the Abhisamayamlliijari, in which Vajravarahi's entire maJ]qala circle is summoned for worship, as well as the teachers and other enlight-ened beings:m Then, in the subde space inside his own heart, he should visu-alize the red syllable VIZ'!' placed on a sun disk that has [itself] been produced &om the seed-syllable ra'!', [and] having driven"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA out [his] inner impurity with rays from that [va,.], he should draw down the mal}4a}a circle of the goddess to be described, and the teachers, buddhas, and bodhisanvas by means of [rays from the va,.syllablc] pouring forth from every hair pore [ofhis body], and [then] he should visualize in front [of him] in space [the celestial hosts]. 121 The divinities arc suspended in front of the practitioner in a thronging mass, a scene familiar from Mahayana sUtras and the earlier tantras. The beings fill the entire universe, packing the ten directions of space so abun-dandy that it is said to resemble a sesame pod full of densely packed seeds.2% v. ~ The next verse in the Vajravdrahi St1Jha1111 instructs the yogin to wor-ship the celestial hosts with imaginary offerings. These billow out like clouds from the rays of the seed-syllable in his heart or through the pores of his body.2s7 Here, in an abbreviated reference, they comprise the five offerings (upactiras), which usually refers to flowers, incense, lamps, per-fumed powders, and food-although the exact sequence may alter accord-ing to the class of tantra (mKhas grub rjc: 179-83). The worship visualization may become more elaborate still as sadhanas prescribe other offerings, such as water to drink and water for washing the feet, or other traditional sets of offerings, such as the seven jewels (saptaratna) or the eight auspicious symbols (llf.tllmanga/4).2sa This type of offering is referred to as \"outer worship\" (btihyapuja) and is distinguished from an \"inner wor-ship\" (aJhylltmapujll) comprising offerings of the five sense organs (ltamagu1JIIS), which arc represented by their respective sense objects: a mir-ror for form or sight, music for sound, incense for smell, food for taste, and cloth for touch. zs9 Both outer and inner offerings are prescribed in the worship section of the Abhisamayamafijari (elsewhere termed the \"secret worship,\" guhya-puja). 260 The Abhisa11111J1lmafijari employs sixteen variously colored \"wor-ship goddesses\" (pujtkkvis) to make the offerings. The first four goddesses offer the traditional gift of music and arc named after the instrument they play: Vil}a (lute), V:upSa (flute), Mrdailga (tabor), and Muraja (drum). The next four goddesses offer song and dance, and their names also reflect their actions: Hasya makes the laughing dance gesture (hllsyllbhi111lya/J), Lasya the dance gesture of love (/llsyllbhi1111Jilf1), and Nrcya (\"dance\") the lotus dance gesture (ltama/4bhi111lyab), while Gita (\"song\") holds \"bell metal\" (? lta1fUilta1.

Perhaps our authors saw no reason to accommodate tantric norms at this point, since this portion of the sadhana represents the Mahayana phase of the spiritual tradition (the bodhisattva's accumulation of merit) and is firmly grounded in Mahayana models of worship. It is tempting to see Umapatideva's sadhana as transi-tional, offering a practice that retains some traditional features, but in so doing, foregoing a complete integration of tantric methods. 263 Following the worship of the deities, Umapacideva prescribes the seven-fold \"supreme worship\" (anuttarapujti) of traditional Mahayana ritual and composes verses that were probably intended for recitation (vv. 5-7). The"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 123 seven steps of the puja begin here with \"confession of faults.\" This differs from the Mahayana model, which opens with \"worship\" (pujan4), foUowed by \"salutation\" (vandand, \"bowing down to all the buddhas\").264 In the sadhana, the stage of worship has already been performed (v. ~b), and so Umapatideva omits it, along with the salutation. This is typical of many other sadhana writers, who tend to detach these two stages from the seven-fold model.265 Without the stages of worship and salutation, Umapatideva is forced to add two more stages in order to preserve the sevenfold sequence, and he therefore finishes the puja with \"resorting to the path\" and \"dedication of one's body.\" Not all sadhana writers produce such a neat solution to the loss of the first two steps in the sequence. The Abhisawuzya-maiijari (GSSs Sed p. 128, KI7n), for example, follows its elaborate visu-alization of the worship with a salutation in the form of the eight-pan mantra. It then presents the Mahayana sequence from the third stage (con-fession), but adds, rather vaguely, that two more stages-\"going for refuge\" and \"resorting to the path\" -are to be done \"beforehand\" (which make seven). Table 11 lays out the Mahayana sequence beside Umapatideva's, and gives examples of the sequences adopted in other sadhanas. The par-allels illustrate the amount of variation and inconsistency at this point in the sadhana, despite the fact that many authors cite verses very similar to those given by U mapatideva.

The bodhisattva's accumulation of wisdom is accomplished in the sadhana through a meditation on the causal nature of reality and the emptiness of inherent existence. The verse, with its simile of the \"moon in water,\" illus-trates the illusory, dreamlike nature of a mind tainted by dichotomizing conceptualization, and points to the philosophy of the Cittamatra/Y oga-cira. 267 The yogin is to reflect upon this through the recitation of the two mantras on emptiness. (§2.) The first mantra (which I term for convenience the \"purity mantra\") expresses the faa that the inherent nature (svabh4va/J)of all existents (sarva-Jha17111i[1) and of the meditator (aham) arc ontologically identical in that both arc empty, and hence \"pure\": O'f' svabhavalut1Jh4b sarvaJhllmlllh O'fl svabhdvaJuJJho 'ha'!'

Other sadhanas explain that by understanding all exis-tents to be empty, the objca (grahyam) is pwified, while by understand-ing the practitioner to be empty, the subject (grtihalta/1) is purified.261 In other words, the first task of the meditator is to realize that all existents that arc objects arc merely conceptual constructs: they arc \"empty\" of any mind-independent reality that may be imputed onto them by the dichotomizing or defiled mind, as in the first half of the purity mantra: \"All existents (dham145) arc pure by nature.\" The second task is to apply the same under-standing to himself, the subject, as in the second half of the purity mantra: \"I am pure by nature.\" This leaves the meditator, in traditional Yogacarin terms, with nothing but the nondual flow of consciousness, empty of sub-ject and objca.269 A fuller formulation of the purity mantra is sometimes given.

The second emptiness mantra (which I have termed here the \"nonduality mantra\") is also a standard feature of mainstream sadhanas: 01fl fUnyatd-jn4navajrllSVabhtivlitmllko 'ham (\"I am identical with the essence /swzbhava] of the nondual/vajra]knowledge of emptiness\").271 The mantra is explained in the Abhisa1MJilmaiijari, where it is encompassed within a short visual-ization meditation. This begins with the meditator seeing the external uni-verse and the 11W]4aia of deities (which was drawn down previously for the piija) dissolving into the \"clear light\" of emptiness. He then sees himself disappearing into clear light. First, he dissolves his whole body into the sun disk at his heart that supports the seed-syllable Vll1fl (t). He then dis-solves the sun disk into the syllable, and the seed-syllable itself from bot-tom to top (the 't into the half-moon -, and the half-moon into the final dot or \"drop\" 0). As even the final drop dissolves into subtle sound or fllilia!J, and the subde sound fades away into nothing, he is left only with emptiness. The meditation is designed to dissolve the yogin's conventional perception that there is a difference between the world of objects (\"the three worlds\"), his visualization (the deity mar_14ala), and himself. The text then goes on to explain the \"nonduality mantra,\" 01f1 fUnyatlljfidnavajraswz-bhavatmalto 'ham, breaking down the long Sanskrit compound into its grammatical pans. It states that the [meditator's] \"knowledge of empti-ness\" (iunyatlijfidna) is \"nondual\" (vajra). because vajra means \"indivisible\" or \"nondual\" (vajram abMJyam); this is the standard interpretation of vajra in the higher tantras. 112 The passage reads as follows:m He should [first] cause the three worlds and the previous (?) m~4ala wheel, whose nature is just illusion (pratibhtJsa.b), to enter clear light (prabhasvarab) itself. Likewise (ca) [he should dissolve himself into emptiness, first dissolving] himself into the sun disk [at his heart], that into the V111f1 syllable [on the sun"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA disk], that into the half-moon, that into the drop (bindup), that into the subtle sound (111iJab). He should even abandon the notion of that [subde sound], having uttered the mantra with the recollection of its meaning: o'!' fimyatlijUMvajrasvabhavatmalto 'ham O'!' I am identical with the essence of the nondual (vajra) knowledge of emptiness The \"knowledge of emptiness\" (JUnyatt1jnd114) is \"nondual\" (vajra) [indicating a ltarmadharaya compound]27• because of its indivisiblity (abhtdyatvat). [When this compound is further compounded with -svabhava, it forms a genitive tatpu\"\"!\" com-pound, meaning] the essence (svabhavab) of that [nondual knowledge of emptiness]. The meaning [of the bahuvrihi com-pound with -dtmalto is]: \"I have the nature (-atmalto) of that [essence of the nondual knowledge of emptiness]., 117 Variations upon this mantra appear in other texts. First, the \"knowl-edge\" component is sometimes differendy defined, as when the mantra is the means of contemplating different aspects of reality. In a relatively early appearance of the mantra, the meditator is identical with the \"essence of the dharmAdhanl' (o1f1 dha1'7'NUihdtusvabhavatmalto 'ham). 275 Second, the grammatical structure of the compound is sometimes subdy altered to read: \"I am identical (dtmalto) with the nondual essence (vajrasvabhava) of X\" (\"X-vajrasvabhdvlltmlllto 'ha1f1), for example: \"I am identical with the non-dual essence of the body, speech, and mind of all yoginis\" (o1f1 sarvayogini-ltayavdltdtuzvajrasvabhavdtmalto 'ham).276 This must be a relatively early version of the mantra, because it is common in the Guhyasamlljatantra, especially at the start of chapter 6, where it appears repeatedly in slighdy different forms but with this same structure. m The sequence in which the two emptiness mantras are given in the V ajravdrdhi SaJhantl is significant. Our author follows the general pattern in sadhanas, which is to prescribe the purity mantra followed by the non-duality mantra. This is because the purification of subject and object (by means of the first mantra) leads one to the understanding (expressed by the second mantra) that there is simply a nondual consciousness, untainted by notions of subject and object. Thus: \"Next he should utter the mantra 'tn,n-All existents are pure by nature. I am pure by nature.' Then he should"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"128 VAJRAYOGINi contemplate emptiness for a while.

'\"271 The Advayavajra-school sadhanas actually treat the purity mantra as an explanatory gloss rather than as an individual mantra.

Emptiness here is [to be contemplated] as follows: [All] this is just con-sciousness as radiance manifesting itself in various forms, as in a dream. There is nothing outside this consciousness. And because there is no object outside consciousness, there is no con-sciousness grasping it. So all existents are empty (lthasvariiptlp).

This is what is meant. One should reflect that the [whole] world of the animate and inani-mate is of the nature of just nondual (atlvaita-) bringing forth (praltiiJa-). This same emptiness he should make firm [or empower] with this mantra: ·o~-1 am identical with the essence of the nondual knowledge of emptiness.\" 12.9 However, the experience of nonduality (in whatever terms it is couched) is not the final goal of the sadhana at this point. It is only a stepping stone and must itself be transcended by an understanding of emptiness that negates even the intrinsic existence of the nondual mind. This is why most sadhanas follow the meditations on emptiness with the instruction to remain for only a shon while in the contemplation of emptiness as non-duality; the meditator is to remain in the contemplation, but \"without resting on it [i.e., on emptiness] as an object\" (aprllli!!hitariipn,uz, aprati-!!harii~). m This points to the Madhyamaka-based doctrine of univer-sal nonobjectification (sarvaJhamuiprat;,_thtinavliJtl), which claims that no experience should be \"objectified\" by the mind, that is, treated as an object with intrinsic existence-not even the experience of emptiness as nondual consciousness or mind. There are many brief references to this doctrine in the Guhyasll1nllJIISil4hana1nllllt including the well-attested verse: \"Homage to you whose conceptualization is without discrimination, whose mind does not rest [on emptiness as an object] (apratifthitamlinASil), who are without remembrance and recollections, without suppon!\"'214 The doctrine of universal nonobjectification arose to counterbalance the Yogacira position on emptiness, which some exegetes saw as positing a really existent substrate to the mind.21s It is this Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis of the eighth century to which our sadhana writers are heir. Santaralqita (c. 68o-740 c.E.), who, with his pupil Kamala.Sila (c. 7oo-7so c.E.), spearheaded the reworking of Yogacira expressions of emptiness, oudines this synthesis as follows: \"Based on the [standpoint] of mind-only one must know the non-existence of external entities. Based on this stand-point [of the lack of intrinsic nature of all dharmas] one must know that there is no self at all even in that (which is mind-only). Therefore, those who hold the reins of logic while riding in the carriage of the two systems [Madhyamika and Yogacara] attain the stage of a true Mahayanist. \"'216 The effect of universal nonobjectification in the sadhana is to endow a"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"130 VAJRAYOGINi purely relative or provisional value to the experience of emptiness engen-dered by the emptiness meditations. According to the Madhyamaka under-standing of emptiness, even emptiness as the experience of nonduality may be (wrongly) taken hold of as a conceptual construct. But in fact, nondual consciousness, or nondual mind, is no different from anything else since it also lacks intrinsic existence and thus belongs to the realm of conventional truth. Seen from this basis, the nondual mind is-like everything else-merely illusory. This is the key to the following stages of the sadhana. The sadhaka's insight into the dreamlike nature of the nondual mind gives him the power to produce or create whatever he chooses, and-crucially-to understand that those creations are just as \"real\" (or \"unreal\") as anything else. In this way, he is able to re-create himself {indeed, the whole world) as the deity. As the \"accumulation of wisdom\" in the Vajravarahi StiJhana is so brief, it omits two features often found in other sadhanas. First, the purpose of the emptiness meditations is said to be to abandon the \"ordinary idea of self' (praJtrttiha'!'karaJ;) that derives from epistemological error.287 During the self-generation that follows, the yogin will replace his ordinary or mun-dane personality. ego identity. or idea of self (aha,ltara/1) with the divine aha,kara of the goddess or deity ( tkvyaha'!'ktirab, tkvalliha'!'ktira). The emptiness meditations are sometimes likened to the death of the medita-tor, as he dissolves his ordinary self into the dha77Nlltaya. 288 He will under-take the following stages of the meditation in the form of an intermediate being-for example, as a ntida {an aspect of subtle sound) situated in space looking down from above. Only once the site has been meditatively pre-pared for the deity with the construction of the vajra ground and temple palace will the yogin gradually transform into the seed-syllable for the ges-tation and birth of the deity (K. Gyatso 1997: 8o-88). The second point commonly made is that the experience of emptiness is not only nonconceptual but blissful. The yogin must therefore make a conscious effort to rouse himself from the meditation, spurred on by his altruistic motivation. The early yogatantra sadhana of Vilasavajra states that, while the yogin is absorbed in meditation on the purified dharma-dhatu, he is separated from the actions that bring welfare to all beings; he continues with the next stage of the sadhana only because of the force of the previously formed bodhisattva vow in his mental continuum.219 In tantric sadhanas the bodhisattva vow is commonly formulated in terms of the deity's ahaf!lklira. It voices the sadhaka's aspiration to \"become\" the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"vv. 1}-14 STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 131 deity and to make the whole world have her form. Although couched in the language of deity yoga, such prescriptions end the accumulations of merit and wisdom in a manner befitting a full-fledged Mahayana bodhi-sattVa, of whom it is said (albeit poetically) that he foregoes his entry into nirvat]a for the benefit of sentient beings: \"For a moment he should med-itate on emptiness and so calm his mind. Having recollected his previous vow, he should again recall just the seed-syllable. Then he should abandon inactive emptiness, being filled with compassion for others, thinking, 'I have betrayed [my fellow] creatures. [For] how shall I rescue them from the bottomless ocean of sarpsira ifl am in this state of complete quiescence?\"'290 Creating the Circk of Protection In the next stage of the sadhana, the yogin aims to re-create the ordinary meditation site into a pure, adamantine realm, suitable for the \"birth\" of Vajravarahi. This is described here in vv. 13-15 with a prose redaction taken from Cakrasarpvara sources in prose paragraphs §3-§5. The newly created meditation site is referred to as the \"circle of protection\" (ralqicllltram), for, in the course of the visualization, the yogin imagines a protective shield of vajras that encompasses the entire universe.l\"l• Our sources describe a struc-ture somewhat like that of a traditional temple. The outer walls define an immeasurable square precinct above which soars the domed \"roof' (liter-ally, \"cage,\" panjaram) with a dangling canopy (in classical fashion) over the central point. 292 It is here, within an elaborate temple palace, that the deity will be generated. The meditation begins with the visualization of hu,, the seed-syllable of a vajra. The yogin then sees the syllable transforming into a double vajra (fig. 26). Other sadhana writers embellish the process, adding that the double vajra is also empowered by hu'!' at irs hub, or that it is visual-ized on a sun disk and is blue in color. 293 In our text the circle of protec-tion is constructed from light rays that blaze out from the first double vajra. It consists of five component parts: the vajra ground, vajra roof, vajra canopy, a net {best understood here as a \"shield\") of arrows (iara-ja/am), and four outer vajra walls. In comparison, the sequence given in the Abhisamayamanjari describes the installation of six parts, starting with the walls and including a ring of flames, all to be visualized simultane-ously.294 (See table 12.)"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"132.

Its parts are said to be composed of burning vajras, or of the blazing rays that issue from the vajras themselves. Where the vajras or rays interlace, they fuse together so entirely that they become \"a single mass without interstices.\"m Commonly, the vajra ground is made of vajras that \"reach to the bottom of the world\" (e.g., GSSs Sed p. 129, KI8n) and thus encompass the whole universe. Rays then issue out from the ground to produce the roof and canopy. Alterna-tively, the rays from the hu'!' may shoot upward to form the canopy, down-ward to produce the floor, and sideways to produce the walls. 2CJ6 The arrows in the net, or \"shield\" of arrows, are also composed of vajras, as the AbhisamllJamanjari reveals: \"above [the vajra ground is] an extremely dense shield of arrows (larajtilam) [clustered] in the form of five-pointed vajras.\"297 The vajras are so vibrant and blaze with rays so intense that their efful-gence engulfs the whole maJ]Qala. This forms a protective outer layer of flames or fiery vajras that complete the circle of protection. 24)1 When depicted in tangkas, the flames are either flame-colored, or the colors of the five buddha families-usually yellow, blue, red, and green (Beer 1999: 23)-symbolizing the supreme protection of wisdom. The direction in which the flames swirl is also significant. As Sanderson (19943 n. 47) has shown in an analysis of 139 maJ]Qalas from the Ngor monastery's collection (bSod-nams-rgya-mrsho 1989), the maJ]Qalas drawn from tantras in the cycles ofSa~pvara and Hevajra in the yoganiruttara class nearly all depict the flames swirling"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 133 counterclockwise, while maJ]c;lalas of other tantric cycles depict the flames swirling in the auspicious, clockwise direction. The creation of the vajra walls is often more complex still, as we see in the Vajravarlihi Sadhana (v. 14 and §4}. The yogin visualizes the syllables of four mantras, which he sees shooting out into the four directions of space, emitting \"a net of quivering rays\": O'!' sumbha nisumbha hu'!' hu'!' pha!.

The blazing rays from the mantras \"fasten in place\" the four vajra walls in a gigantic square. This is confirmed by a parallel passage from the AbhisamllJilmafijari. which also shows how the yogin generates the walls from the light issuing from the syllables (which, according to one Tibetan Cakrasaqtvara sadhana, are themselves the color of their respective directions} :m With a snap of his left forefinger and thumb he should project out ( utsdrya) the mantras, [uttering] (iti)-o'!' sumbha nisumbha hu'!' hu'!' pha!-D'!J grihna grihna hu'!' hu'!' pha!-D'!' grihruipaya grihntipaya hu, hu, phat-o'!' anaya ho bhagavan vajra hu'!' hu'!' pha!.

In the Cakrasarpvara tradition, this four-part mantra is prescribed as a method for installing the complete circle of protection, and is referred to as the \"four-faced mantra\" (caturmulthamtZntra/J).• The function of the walls is to define the outermost limits of a meditation ground that encom-passes the cosmos. In some texts, they are said to form a \"vajra binding\" (vajrabandha/J) or a \"boundary\" (simtZn), that is, the topographical limit of the area that the sadhaka is to bring under his control..J01 The circle of protection is installed in some sadhanas simply through the"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"134 VAJRAYOGINI recitation of a set of six mantras. lOl Most of the mantras refer to the feature they install (the noun in stem form}, and revolve around the seed-syllable of the vajra. hu,.

This is shown, according to the Sanskrit prescriptions, in figure 24· Ritual daggers (lti/4 /Tib.: phur ba) have a complex iconography, as they are understood to be animated by, and hence to represent, deities . .Mn Having visualized the awful goddesses, the yogin imagines them herd-ing together all the obstacles inside the universe of the vajra zone and destroying them. To accomplish this, the goddesses utter the powerful vajric syllable hu,, upon which eight \"wells\" appear in each of the directions"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi \"near\" (samipa) the vajra walls. J06 The goddesses now force the obstacles into these wells by means of two aggressive mantras: first, the \"staking mantra\" common to the higher tantras (lriltznamantrab: cf. GS ch. 14, vv. 59-65), and next the \"hammering mantra\" (altotanamantrap). In the par-allel account of the Abhisamayamanjari, the mantras also transform the slain obstacles into enlightened consciousness \"by means of great bliss\" (mahasulthma), so that they have \"the single form of suchness\" (tathatllilut-riipa1J1). This text adds that once they have served their purpose, the yogin imagines the goddesses themselves dissolving into the walls, leaving him convinced that \"the world is made of one solid mass without interstices and is free of obstacles. \"J07 A final note on the circle of protection concerns its position within the structure of the sadhana as a whole. In the V ajravartihi SaJhana it appears immediately after the yogin has completed the bodhisattva accumulations of merit and wisdom. In some sadhanas, however, it is prescribed before the practitioner has performed the latter with its meditations on emptiness. Indeed, this seems to have been the earlier version. 308 The Abhisamaya-mttfljari explains the different methods by stating that, for advanced prac-titioners, their understanding of emptiness affords supreme protection in itself, and so they do not need to reinforce the effect of the emptiness med-itations with the additional protection of the vajra ground, as ordinary practitioners do:~ However, in the [H~Ita-}Abhisamaya (the \"[Heruka] Method of Realization\") of Liiyipada, the meditation on emptiness is taught following the canopy of protection and so forth, because one who has exceptional insight is qualified [by his spiritual maturity to do so]. For him, emptiness itself (1Unyatlliva}'10 is the supreme protection. But in this [sadhana], because [of the needs] of the mass of ordinary folk, the canopy of protection and so on is taught immediately after the meditation on emptiness. And in many [other] methods of realization (abhisamayas) this same sequence is found.

Although many tantric sadhanas mention the cremation grounds in brief, the Vajravarlihi Stitihana is one of only a couple works in the GubyasamiiJIISiillha1111mtilti to give a full account of them .. m Although they are relatively undeveloped in earlier yoginitantras, in the Cakrasarpvara corpus they appear as a set of eight chamd grounds that extend into the eight directions of space. It is upon these sources that our author draws when he appends seven verses (vv. 7o-76) to the end of the Vajravarlihi StiJhana in order to describe the cremation grounds in more detail. In the discussion that follows, I draw upon these works. They are summarized in tabular form in table 14 (with notes).312 The V ajravlirahi Stuiha1111 verses describe the cremation grounds first in the cardinal, and then in the intermediate, directions. Here we sec that each cremation ground has its own distinaivc characteristics. Each is indi-vidually named and has a named set of features and creatures dwelling within it. These include a tree, a protector, a serpent (nagab), and a cloud. Other texts also mention demons (rti/tfasiiS), great adepts (mahasiJJhas), funeral monuments (caityas), mountains, fires, lakes (the abode of the nagas), and rivers (which in pictorial representations often divide the cre-mation grounds). Sometimes the inhabitants are described in relation to each other, as when the naga at the foot of the tree makes obeisance to the protector (see notes to table 14). Other accounts are given in more general terms. The cremation grounds arc home to fearsome creatures, such as crows, owls, vultures, jackals, hawks, lion-&ced and tiger-&ced beings, lizards, camels, and so on. Grue-some corpses are found impaled on spears, hanging, half-burned, or decap-itated; their dismembered parts arc scattered about: skulls, knees, large bellies, heads with tusks, and bald heads. Supernatural spirits haunt the grisly place, such as yalt,as, wtli/as, rli!t,asas, and others roaring with ltililti/a laughter. Finally, we find tantric adepts and spiritual beings resident there; siJJh4s with magical powers, viJyaJharas, troops of yogins and yoginis, and so forth. m Another sadhana from the Guhyasamayaslit/hanamti/4 col-lection (GSS34) describes the cremation grounds as follows:~•• In this [explanation?] there are the cremation grounds; they are harsh and terribly frightening; they [each] have a protector, a tree, a serpent lord, and a cloud king. They are replete with the eight [auspicious] signs. This is the characteristic of the crema-tion ground. It is said: He should perform the prior service"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGJNi actually in the cremation ground in which [there are terrible dis-turbances] such as fearsome fights, which is disfigured, which is very gruesome, [and] in which there is a terrifying noise from the crowds of female ghosts. [He should perform it] in the company of female ghosts, female goblins, female jackals, and so on. The cremation grounds are often vividly depicted in tangkas. Com-monly, the different cremation grounds are separated by rivers (usually eight), which are seen running through them, as in plates 1, n, and 13 (and on the detail of the tangka shown here on the back cover). Within the cre-mation grounds, we see depicted the protectors and their consorts on their appropriate mounts, often presiding at the center of each cremation ground, seated by a tree and surrounded by fearsome animals, birds, skele-tal remains, and plenty of bones. We can also see fires, caityas, nagas, mahasiddhas, devotees, and wild dancing figures. In some tangkas (as in the small details of platen), we find the cremation grounds depicted inside the circle of protection, with auspicious embellishments beyond that (although GSS34 cited above included the auspicious signs as features of the cremation grounds themselves). Other artists depict the cremation grounds outside the circle of protection (as in the crowded and lively scenes on plate 12). Where the cremation grounds appear as a pictorial backdrop to tangkas (as in plates 1 and n), it is particularly clear that they are not meant ro take a peripheral place in the outer reaches of the maJ.l4aJa, but that they underpin the whole scene, with the rest of the maJ.l4aJa super-imposed upon them.m As they fill the entire vajra ground (which itself fills all of space), the cre-mation grounds take on cosmic proportions. In this respect it is interest-ing to note that some of the cremation-ground features bear similarities to the traditional Abhidharmic cosmos. This suggests that the higher tantras are recasting the cosmos along lttiptililta lines so that the eight cremation grounds become a cosmological model in their own right. Thus, just as the cremation grounds, spread in the eight directions, are presided over by the traditional protectors and include eight mountains and eight lakes, so the cosmos according to the Abhidharma describes continents spreading in the directions (although twelve in number), with eight mountains (Mount Meru and its seven mountain ranges) and eight \"lakes.\" 316 Features of our own continent, Jambudvipa, may also be echoed in the composition of the cremation grounds, as it too contains sets of mountains, a lake (Lake Anava-tapta beyond Gandhamadana Mountain), and rivers. The jambu tree is"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 139 located near the lake (ADK ch. 3, v. 57}, and there are also eight nagas who are said to sustain the earth (ADK ch. 3. v. 83~ with Pruden 1991 n. 472}. The development of a cremation-ground cosmology is evident in myths from the yogatantra corpus dealing with the subjugation of Saiva deities. In the Sarvatathagatatllttvas41flgraha (SITS ch. 6}, the conversion of Siva brings about the creation of a new buddha field in the form of a cremation ground called \"Covered with Ashes\" (Bhasmtkhann~~), while Siva himself becomes the tathagata \"Lord of Ashes\" (BhllS71ldvara). The new cosmo-logical perspective is strikingly illustrated in the contemporary (eighth-cen-tury} *Guhyagarbha. In this text, Heruka is emanated in warrior stance upon a mountain of bones surrounded by an ocean of blood-a clear ref-erence to the traditional cosmology of Mount Meru and its surrounding ocean. It is in just these terms that a twelfth-century Tibetan work seeks to account for the origin of the cremation-ground cosmos:m At the beginning of this ltaliyuga. beings started contending with each other through their common animosity. As the bodies started piling up from their mutual slaughter, they were removed to the various directions, and the eight great charnel grounds formed. From the corpses ran blood and, as its vapor rose: into the sky, the eight clouds evolved. When the douds gave off rain, the eight rivers developed, and in them the eight divine nagas arose. Mists carne from the rivers, and the eight trees grew, each of them with its own protector. Then to the south of Sumeru, in the continent ofjambudvipa, Mahdvara's emanation arose:."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi Table 14.

The traditional cosmos is described in the Abhidharmaltoia and bha,ya (ch. 3. \"The World\"). It is said to exist upon a substrate of space (iiltiila/J), upon which rest cylindrical layers of wind, water, and gold, one upon the other, each diminishing in size. Upon the topmost layer of gold is the ocean, which is encompassed by an iron ring at its rim and dotted with twelve continents in the four directions. At the center of the ocean are the mountains: seven ranges separated by lakes with Mount Meru in the center. (See plate 15.) Comparing this with the sadhana visualization, it is clear that several changes have taken place.32° Firstly, the higher tantras replace the substrate, space-which is a metaphor for emptiness-with emptiness itself. This is appropriate to the sadhana because the visualization of the cosmic sub-strate \"emptiness\" arises out of the experience of emptiness that the yogin has cultivated in the foundational meditations on emptiness that precede it (sometimes directly preceding it, as in the Abhisamayamanjari cited ear-lier).~11 Next, the sadhana visualizations introduce the element fire between the mar:tcJalas of wind and water, producing the new sequence: wind, fire, water, and eanh. This sequence mirrors the traditional list of the elements within the human body (ADK ch. 3, v. 44b) and has the effect of corre-lating macrocosm (the cosmos) and microcosm (the practitioner). This correlation is a theme developed later in the sadhana, panicularly in the meditations upon the body mar:tc:lala. Finally, the sadhana visualization directs the meditator to visualize Mount Meru resting directly upon the ele-ment earth, somewhat simplifying the traditional cosmic features of the ocean and its continents. In contrast, the visualization of Mount Meru itself may be elaborate. Once again, the earlier citation from the Abhisamayamalijari fills out details that are absent in the brief prescriptions of the Vajravdrlihi Sddhana (v. 35c). The Abhisamayamafijari is typical of mainstream sadhanas in that it accords with the Abhidharmakoia and its commentaries, in which Mount Meru is described as square, with four immeasurable walls made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal facing north, east, south, and west respectively (AD K ch. 3, v. soa, with Vyakhyaby Ya.Somitra). Sadhana literature often refers to the \"eight peaks\" ofMeru (ADK ch. 3, vv. 48b--49C), that is, its own central peak (the square of four jeweled substances), plus the seven golden \"peaks\" in diminishing height that form concentric squares around Mount Meru.-m Meru itself also has four \"terraces\" (pan,ar,vlas) that are the abode of vari-"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHi SADHANA 147 ous types of beings. In a visualization of Sumeru supplied by mKhas grub rje (p. 175), which he ascribes to the kriyatantra, the terraces are to be embel-lished with stairs of precious stuffs, wish-fulfilling trees, and victory banners. (These are also visible on plate 15.) In traditional, Abhidharmic cosmology, Meru is crowned by the city of the thirty-three gods (Sudar-Sana) with Sakra's palace (Vaijayanta) at the center, surrounded by parks \"for pleasure and for love\" (ADK ch. 3, vv. 65-68). In the higher tantras, Sakra's temple palace is taken over by their cult deities, and the central mountain becomes a stage to the cosmic dra-mas of enlightenment played out by new buddhas at the head of new divine retinues.m Mainstream sadhanas frequently draw on formulaic verse from older yogatantra sources to describe the ornamental features of the temple palace: It is made of jewels, is square with four or eight pillars, and has four multilevel ponicoes. The eaves are supponed by makaras (mythical sea monsters}, flanked to the right and left by a buck and a doe, and topped by a Dharma wheel. It is beautified with strings of pearls, doth banners, vases, mirrors, yak-tail fly whisks, multicolored pennants and bells, and may spon a cupola adorned by a jewel and a vajra, or vajras resting on sickle moons at the four corners.'24 In tangka paintings, the ponicoes are aligned with the four tips of the double vajra upon which the whole edi-fice rests ( vifvavajravedika). m These elaborate gates are usually drawn as if seen from in front, as in plates 12 and 13-although the rest of the mal}c:lala is shown from an aerial perspective. In plate 14, however, we see the entire temple palace in three-dimensional elevation. m, Fig. 26. Doubk vajra. In rejecting the temple palace as the residence of the deity, the Vajra-varahi Sadhana makes significant strides toward a more integrated higher tantric practice. We have seen that the prescriptions for the cremation grounds are given weight in the sadhana with an extra series of verses (vv."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"I-48 VAJRAYOGINi 7o-76) supplementing the main prescription (in v. 16). In contrast, the visualization of the cosmos is merely appended in brief at the end of the first meditation stage. The Vajravarlihi SaJhaNl therefore represents an interesting phase of development within the Guhyasamayaslilihanama/A col-lection as a whole. It appears to be midway between sadhanas that remain rooted in the cakravartin temple palace tradition, and those that depict a more consistent representation of ltapalilta praxis. Thus, we can broadly identify three types of sadhana composition, all roughly contemporane-ous, in the Guhyasamayasadhanamti/a. 1. First are the mainstream sadhanas that follow the traditional cakra-Vartin model. These locate the temple palace upon Mount Meru (visu-alizing it inside the circle of protection and the origin of existents [dharmodayii}}. They make no reference at all to the cremation grounds as a location for the self-generation, despite the fact that they deal with the generation of a ltiipalilta deity-for example, the Abhi-samayamanjari (GSSs; based on the Hm4ltabhisamaya f. 3v) and sadhanas by Advayavajra (e.g., GSS3). 2. Next are the transitional sadhanas that combine an implicit temple palace model with a greater focus on lulpiililta praxis. This is the mid-way position of the Vajravarahi saahana. & the mar:t4ala is built up in the subseqent meditation stages, we will see that its structure is that of the temple palace, in which deities of the retinue are placed formally around a central cakravartin-style deity. Despite this, the V ajraviirahi SaJhana omits any mention of the temple palace itself, perhaps an admission that the formal symmetry of this structure is an anachronism within the cremation-ground culture of a ltapiililttl cult. Although our author does include the visualization of the traditional cosmos, he downgrades it to a lesser alternative by placing it at the end of his first meditation stage (v. 35). His preferred emphasis on the cre-mation-ground cosmology highlights the fact that the deities of Vajravarahi' s mar:t4ala inhabit a very different setting and command a very different worldview. These developments have their base in scripture, for it is notable that Umapatideva's omission of the temple palace mirrors the Sa,varoJayatantra (ch. 13, VV. 12-13ff.).327 3· Moving a stage funher still toward the integration of ltaplililttl inter-ests, the GuhyasamayastiJhaMmtiiA also includes a group of\"skdeton arch\" (ltaranltatora!'a) sadhanas (GSS32-34).

The self-generated goddess is enthroned beneath an arch of human skeletons that is ornamented with skeletonic parasols. These developed ltapdlilta sadhanas also show a greater degree of internalization within the med-itation techniques espoused, based on the yogic methods of svd-Jhi!_thdna (\"self-consecration\") practice (see the appendix for more details). S~lf-Gmnation through th~ Awakenings v. 16 The next stage in the visualization is perhaps the most important in the sadhana as a whole: the self-generation of the yogin \"as\" Vajravarahi. The yogin begins by creating a locus for the forthcoming meditations at the center of the cremation grounds (v. 16a). He first visualizes an invened tri-angle that (in our text) is white in color /21 and within which he sees a vibrant red lotus (v. 16b-d). The triangle is the \"origin of existents\" (Jharmoti4yd)or \"source of[all purified] JhamlllS\" (Jhamuxitlya/1). a spatial and visual metaphor for the unoriginated, transcendental plane of real-ity.329 Terms such as the Dharma body (e/harmaltayab). suchness (tathatd), and the sphere of Dharma (dharmadhiituiJ) are also applied to the dharmo-t/4yd, and it is often said to \"have the nature of the dharmadharu\" (e/harma-elhdtustNJbhtiva)or to be \"one with the dharmadharu\" (Jhamuulhiitumaya). A3 a \"source\" or \"origin,\" the Jha1'1fl0fi4yli is also equated with the female sex organ or womb (bhagaf,l. yonip). This imagery is highlighted by its invened triangular shape (V), which is a simulacrum of the pubis. A3 in north Indian post-Gupta scripts, V happens to represent the letter t, so the dharmoti4yd is sometimes referred to simply as t.no The fact that the origin of existents represents both the reality of empti-ness and a woman's sex reflects the sexual soteriology of the higher and highest tanuas. m In these systems, emptiness is described experientially as the ecstatic, all-consuming great bliss, the tantric metaphor for which is orgasm. Thus, the experience of emptiness or bliss is said to \"arise in\" or to be \"produced from\" the JharmoJayii, or the woman's sex. This imagery is employed in both the Guhyasamaja (yogottara) and Hevajra (yoganirut-tara) traditions, in which the root tantras famously begin: \"Thus have I heard: At one time the Lord sponed in the vaginas of the vajra maidens. \"m Here, because the vagina represents the bliss of enlightenment, it becomes another spatial metaphor for buddhahood. Its locus is the blissful dwelling"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"ISO VAJRAYOGINi place of the buddhas, a tannic reworking of the Mahayana concept of the pure land Sukhavati. m Where tannic deities are in sexual union, the female deity represents bliss, emptiness, or wisdom, while the male partner sym-bolizes compassion, or means (upayab). In the Vajrayogini tradition, how-ever, the goddess is without a conson, and so she represents in herself the union of both wisdom (female) and means (male). Nevertheless, sexual symbolism still permeates the visualization. For example, during the med-itation representing Vajravarahi's \"conception\" (v. 17), we will see that her seed-syllable va'!l is visualized inside the dharmodaya. Here, the syllable vaiJI is also the seed-syllable for the vajra, which is a tantric euphemism for penis, while the dharmotlayatriangle symbolizes the woman's sex or womb. Because of the coincidence of V with the letter ~. the word roa1JI (syllables ~ + va1J1) is often said to symbolize this union: \"Homage to you, Vajra-yogini; [you] who is seated in the syllables ~(V) -Va'Jl. whose form is innate (sahaja) bliss, who is the knowledge of wisdom, and who is placed in the body!\"3l4 vv. The following verses describe the conception and binh of the deity. The 17-19a terse lines of the Vajravarahi saJhana in fact describe a sequence of med-itations known in exegetical works as the five awakenings (paficabhisam-bodhiltramab). These are significant in that they define the Vajravtirahi Sddhana as a sadhana of the \"generation method\" (utpattiltramab). The five awakenings have their roots in the yogatantras, where the term \"awak-ening\" (abhisambodhib) refers to a meditation on the five wisdoms as pan of the preliminary emptiness meditations.335 The term seems to have been first applied to the process of self-generation in the Hroajratantra, although it is chiefly the Hevajra commentarial tradition that is responsible for its analysis into the five awakenings.3J6 The subject proved to be a fenile ground for meditative and exegetical elaboration. Indeed, the five awak-enings are only one of many sets of correlations that surround the self-generation process, including an earlier systematization in the yogottara tradition that produced a rather different [set of] four vajras (vajracam,lta). A set of\"six gods\" is also taken up in one Tibetan tradition and correlated with the five awakenings . .m Because the Vajravariihi SaJhana deals with the subject only briefly, a fuller exposition of the five awakenings is cited below from an elaborate prose passage in the Abhisamayamaiijari.

It instructS the sadhaka to imagine a moon disk (the first awakening) and a sun disk (the second awakening); these are seen lying upon the red lotus that is inside the dhannodaya. The passage just cited from the Abhisamayamaftjari describes a more complex version of the med-itation. In a tradition following both the Hevajra and Saqwara scriptures, the disks are generated from the letters of the alphabet. The moon disk is produced from a sequence of vowels, and the sun disk from a sequence of consonants, which is termed in brief the \"yoga ('union' or 'practice') of vow-els and consonants\" (aliltti/iyoga}_l).~ The alphabetical sequence of letters has been shown above in the vagvilutidhi (GSSs Sed p. 125, IU4vs); but here, the Abhisamayamanjari states that the sixteen vowels (a d i i u u r f! u t ai o au a'!' ab) should be visualized as a double row, thus making thirty-two letters, and that the thirty-three consonants (Ita to ha) should also be extended by the addition of Jt,a and six other letters ( 1/4 rJha da Jha ya 14), to make forty. This row of forty letters is also visualized as a double row, making eighty consonants in aU. This embellishment introduces the added symbolism of the thirty-two auspicious \"major marks\" (lalt!a1J4S) and the eighty \"subsidiary marks\" (anuvyafijanas) of a buddha. Some sources add that the rows of letters are seen to revolve, the vocalic turning counter-clockwise and the consonantal turning clockwise, before they transform into the moon and sun disks rcspcctivdy.,.• At the dose of the second stage of the awakenings, the sun disk and moon disk should be seen to mingle. This is a simulacrum of sexual union and gives rise to great bliss. For just as the vowels and consonants formed a pair of opposites that represented the polarity of female and male, this is true also of the two disks. In this case the red sun disk symbolizes the blood of the female partner, and the white moon disk the semen of the male part-ncr (e.g., Beyer 1978: no), thus supplying two of the three essential factors required for conception in traditional embryology (ADKbh ch. 3, vv. Io-17). The third factor, the intermediate being, arises in the course of the next awakening. v. 17b-d In the same verse, the Vajravdrahi Sdl:ihanadescribes the third awaken-ing: the visualization ofVajravarahi's seed-syllable, V41!'· bctwccn the two disks. This represents the third requirement for conception, namely, the presence of the intermediate being (gandharvasattvami)342 that is generated when the great bliss of intercourse gives rise to the implantation of a \"seed\" in the womb. 343 Our author instructs the meditator to visualize the va'!' as red, quivering with light rays, and vividly clear. In some Vajravarahi"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA sadhanas, the seed in the womb is represented instead by a vajra that is empowered by a Vll'!' syllable enscribed upon its central point.,.. In his AmNiyllmdjllri, Abhayakaragupta explains that the seed is a five-pronged vajra, and that each of its prongs correlates with a limb (head, two feet, and two hands) of the divine embryo, or (as elsewhere in the same text), with the five fingers and toes, and the five sense organs on the head of the embryo (Beyer 1978: 12.4). The vajra is in fact the emblem (cihnam) of hmJuz manifestations such as Hevajra and Sarpvara through their familial genesis in the vajra family of Alqobhya, and as such is sometimes produced from hu,, the seed-syllable of the vajra family. Although Vajravarahi's emblem is the wheel ( CAitrllm), from her association with the buddha fam-ily ofVairocana, her tradition preserves the vajra as an established part of the sequence of awakenings. v. 18 The next verse (v. 18) describes the fourth awakening, namely, the emis-sion and retraction of rays from the seed-syllable into the universe, where they provide spiritual benefit to all beings. The power of mantric rays to remove sins, to benefit beings, and to attract or impel deities is often referred to in this stage. Their agency is lavishly described by mKhas grub rje (p. 161):34~ Then one imagines that from those letters emanate innumer-able rays of light, from the ends of which issue innumerable aspects of the body of that god to be intensely contemplated. They purify all sentient beings from their sins, obscurations, and sufferings, and they give joy to all the buddhas and their sons by making offerings to them. Then the rays, together with the gods, are withdrawn, absorbed by the letters; and the moon, together with the letters, transforms itself into the perfected body of the god to be contemplated. Once the rays have accomplished their lofty purpose, they are seen retract-ing back into the seed-syllable. The V lljrttviiriihi StiJhllna states that, as they retract, they should bring back coundess buddhas into the syllable; elsewhere they summon the entire world (e.g., GSS1o I47V3). The seed-syllable Vll'!' is now pregnant with significance: It is at once the repository of the potentiality of buddhahood (GSS32 Kiosr2.: bu4dh~ttva7'!' h~tu­bhiitllm ... ) and a symbol of its actuality, Vajravarahi. v. 19a The final awakening (described in v. 19a) transforms the seed-syllable into the body of the deity. This is understood as the deity's birth into the"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"154 VAjRAYOGINI world. The analogy is given in the second chapter of the Sa'!'varodayatantra (vv. 12c-2o) in a passage that draws upon both traditional Indian embry-ology and upon the tantric topology of the inner body made up of chan-nels, winds, and drops.w. In the first stage of this account (vv. 12~16b), consciousness is said to arrive through the mouth, carried on winds that circulate in the seventy-two-thousand channels (1Uitjis). The scripture (v. 16cd) then describes the attainment of highest bliss as the vowels and con-sonants melt together. This is the equivalent of the second awakening. Next, consciowness \"exists between semen (Jultram) and menstrual blood (io!Jitam) in the form of a dot (bindu/J)\" (v. 17ab), which is the moment when the gandharvasattva enters, the equivalent of the third awakening. In the fifth month of its germination, the embryo develops its fleshly form in five aspects (vv. I7cd-19b), and these are correlated with the five buddhas. In the seventh month (v. 19cd), it grows hair, nails, and sex organs; in the eighth and ninth it develops its senses and full form; and in the tenth, it takes on sentience (v. 2od: utanli). The birth (which takes place accord-ing to Indian tradition in the tenth month after conception) is equivalent to the generation of the body of the deity in the final stage of the five awak-enings. (The processes of gestation and birth described here are even more explicit in sadhanas where the deities to be evoked are in sexual union.)w Together, the five awakenings are understood to correspond to the three bodies of a buddha. The dharma body (dharmaltayab) is the origin of the self-generated deity in the unconstructed transcendental plane of emptiness. Tsong kha pa remarks that \"it is inadmissible that a Buddha could wish to serve the aim of those he takes in hand only through the Dharma Body without a body of form\" (Beyer 1978: 127). Thw, in the course of the self-generation, the irradiating seed-syllable of the fourth awakening is seen as the emanation body (nimui!JaltliJab) which, like that buddha body, is for the benefit of the world. The final form of the deity is understood to exist as an enjoyment body (sa,bhogalttiyab), with all the major and minor marks of a tenth-stage bodhisattva (mKhas grub rje 1978: 27). Abhayakara-gupta explains that the Sll'!'bhogaltaya and the nimui!Ja/uiya are conven-tional in that both are reflexes of emptiness and are therefore constructed. m S~lf-Visualization As Vajravarahi vv.

It is these six that became the prototype for tantric yogins, who wore them as part of their \"skull observance\" (kaptilikavratam).311 Perhaps as a reflection of the god-dess's new cultic role as central deity, the sixth mudra of ashes is on occa-sion also assumed by female deities (see ch. 2). The Abhisam4Jilmaiijari lists both the fivefold and sixfold sets of mudras and comments on Vajravarahfs new status:372 [Vajravarahi] bears the five signs of observance (muariis), namely, chaplet (cam), earrings (ltu'.\"!tJam), necklace (kaT}!hi), armlets (rucakam), and girdle made of pieces [of bone] (kha!'-t!Jnkamekhala). There is the following verse (iti): \"[Visualize her] adorned with necklace, armlets, earrings, head jewel,-m [and with] the sacred thread [and] ash. [These are] proclaimed as the six signs of observance.\" Some say (iti) she has the six signs of observance because of the fact that she is leader of the maJ;lQala. As a set of five or six, the mudras are naturally equated with the five buddhas and the sixth, transcendent buddha. 374 They may also take on a ritual appli-cation, as they are on occasion installed on the yogin-goddess' body with mantra syllables rather in the manner of an armoring. m As we will see, this type of symbolism pervades each of the mudras individually."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 159 For the chaplet, the Vajravarahi StidhaNZ describes an ornate forehead band (v. 2ul). The cloth band would once have been a tie wound counter-clockwise around the head for binding up matted locks,.m but here (v. 22e) it is more decorative and sports a row of five human skulls interspersed with vajras. The five skulls are identified with the five buddhas, and it is com-mon for the central skull to manifest the seal, the presence in miniature of the head of the buddha family to which the deity belongs-Vairocana (reserved in our sadhana for the next stage of the meditation; see v. 27).~17 The Vajravdrahi StiJhaNZ (v. 22ab) also notes that Vajravarahi's hair tie has come adrift, leaving her hair loose and disordered-a statement of her untrammeled sexuality.371 Some hair (perhaps her matted locks) is fastened on the top of her head by a hair clasp formed of a double vajra.319 The other mudris (v. 23) are also of human bone. Apart from the necklace and ear-rings (often depiaed as two large loops), there are two sons of armlet on each arm, a wrist bracelet (rucaltam).• and an armlet worn on the upper arm (/uyiiram). There may also be anklets (nupura/1). which Umapatideva says are \"tinkling\" (he lists them in v. 21c separately from the other mudras).

On occasion she is even described as menstruating.382 She is tantalizing \"with fresh youth\" (v. 24b), an aspect of the erotic sentiment (frtigtira/1) that the texts are eager to promote.113 Her breasts are firm and raised, and her form, tender and lovely. Despite her lone status, she is still overcome with lust (as when she was in embrace with Cakrasarpvara), and she laughs with her mouth open and her body horripilating, a perfect \"receptacle of great bliss\" (v. 24C).·~ Another aspect of Vajravarahi's character is her compassionate wrath. This is particularly evident in her stance (v. 19cd). Like her former consort Cakrasarpvara, Vajravarahi assumes the classical pose of the archer, the warrior stance (aliljha-dsaNZm): she steps onto her flexed left leg and stretches out her right leg behind, as described in the Abhisam4Jilman}ari: \"[Vajravarahi should be visualized] ... with the alitjha [stance], bending her left leg and stretching back her right five vittzstis [i.e., sixty finger-breadths], indicating that the world is \"licked up\" (a + v Jib > tiJV!ha) by emptiness ... ,.., And just as Cakrasarpvara is visualized trampling upon the corpses of the"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"160 VAJRAYOGINI supreme Saiva deities, Bhairava and Kalaratri, so is the solo Vajravarahi. 516 The Vajravdrdhi SaJhana states that she stands with one foot (the left) upon Bhairava's head and the other (the right) upon Kalaratrfs breast (v. 19cd). Bhairava is described in another sadhana387 \"with four arms, his torso hean-[side] down, [his] face up gazing at the lady [Vajravarahi], with a chopper and skull held in the first pair of arms, wearing a tiger skin [as a lower garment], [and] in his other pair of arms holding a t#zm4ru and tri-dent, with three eyes, a snarling mouth, blue, with yellow hair, [and] adorned with [a chaplet] of white skulls.\" The subdued Saiva goddess, Kalaratri (\"Kalaratri\" and \"Kalaratrika\" are also attested in our texts, but in this instance she is called Carcika), is simply described as \"red.\" Illus-trations generally depict her lying face up, holding a vajra chopper and skull bowl in her two arms.~ In general terms, the subjugation of the Saiva deities represents Vajravarahi's conquest over all evil, whether that repre-sented by another religious system (other brahmanical gods are sometimes trampled upon, too), or of evil per se in the classic guise of Mara, the Bud-dhist embodiment of the defilements and death. 319 The subjugation of deities is an expressive theme within the higher and highest Buddhist tantras as a whole, and has recently been the focus of scholarly attention.390 Its origins are twofold. In its widest sense, the topos of subjugation embraces the traditional Indian mythology of the battle between the gods and the demons, good and bad. This is a favorite theme of the Puri!]as, perhaps the most famous example of which is the fight for the nectar of immortality churned up from the ocean of milk. Some myths produce a variation upon the theme and recount tales in which a demonic foe is not only defeated and forced to submit, but in which the submission is then transformed into devotion (bhaltti/1) and service toward the gods . ..,• In the higher tantras, the myth is given its own panicular slant and brought into the service of Buddhism. The story first appears as a comic talc in the root scripture of the yogatantras, the Sarvat4thdgal4tllttVasil'!'grttha (ch. 6). It concerns the entry ofVajrapir)i, the tantric bodhisattva, into the maJ]9ala of the buddha V airocana. Vajrapil]i has boldly announced that he will not enter (prati-V pad) the maJ]4ala himself until he has seen the world's wickedness entirely transformed and brought within the IIW]4aia also. V airocana therefore utters powerful mantras that drag all the evil beings of the world before his palace on Mount Meru, including the terrible Lord Siva (Mahdvara) and his retinue of evil gods whom none, not even all the tatha-gatas, have succeeded in taming. Vajrapil]i then commands them to con-ven (prati-v paJ) by taking the three refuges and vowing to gain omniscient"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHi SADHANA 161 knowledge.

(uttered by Vairocana) followed by Vajra~i's explosive Jnn.n.'lnstandy, Mahdvara is struck dead, while his retinue falls to the ground groaning. Thrice the gods plead for their lives, slyly arguing that they don't understand Buddhism, and so it would be un-Buddhist of Vaj~i-a compassionate bodhisattva-to kill them. Yaj~i at wt restores them, and they experience divine blisses and serve him. But the conversion of recalcitrant Mahdvara is not so easy. Although he is restored to life, he insists that he would rather die than obey Vajra~'s demands. Thereupon, Vajrapil:li utters mantras that haul Mahc:Svara and his conson stark naked before him, and tramples them underfoot while the world looks on and laughs. With another mantra, Vajra~i stands with his left foot upon Mahdvara and his right foot upon U mi, and a great cry resounds through the three worlds proclaiming Vajra~ as the victor. Then through Vairocana's compassion, the touch ofVajrapaqi's foot becomes a source of consecrations, meditational powers, and so forth leading to enlightenment, and Mahdvara is transformed into a buddha (BhasmeSvaranirghop) in another buddha realm (Bhasmicchanna) in a far-off world system. m The same themes of subjugation and conversion appear in other eighth-century texts, some of which show a marked increase in sex and violence. \"3 The myth in the *Guhyllgarbha/GuhyaltoiA is a case in point, as the accounts by Sanderson (1995) and Davidson (1991) reveal. Following these scholars, we find that here Mahdvara' s demonic activities are more pronounced. After a period in the hells (because of practicing transgressive tantras without an understanding of emptiness) he is at last reborn as Rudra, who terrorizes the universe with diseases and insanity. In order to rescue Rudra from sarpsara, the tathigata emanates a oonson for himself (KrodheSvari, Lady of Wrath), and from their mingled sexual fluids gives birth to a pantheon of wrathful deities who oonquer the wicked tyrant and his retinue.

As this still does not overcome his antagonist, the Tathagata assumes an even more terrifying form with nine heads, eight legs, and eight-een arms, and resorts to even more extreme methods, which Davidson (1991: 203) describes as follows: \"Heruka, the cosmic policeman, seizes Mahdvara and his entire retinue, rips out their internal organs, hacks their limbs to pieces, eats their flesh, drinks their blood, and makes ritual ornaments from their bones-a model of thoroughness. Having digested all these gods [but discarding their hearts and sense organs], Heruka excretes them into an enormous ocean of muck, which one of his henchmen, Ucch~makrodha, drinks up. The gods are then revived. Properly grateful for what can only have been an extraordinary experience, Mahdvara and his minions beseech Heruka and the divinities of his maQQala to accept their wives, mothers, and daughters as ritual consorts while they take their correct places as the seats of the divinities in the Mai)Qala.\" The themes reappear in yoginitantra exegetical works, with some varia-tions.394 In Bu ston's account (related at length by Kalff 1979: 67ff.), the twenty-four sacred sites (pi!hiiS) have been wickedly usurped by low-class spirits and demonic gods; r~, yak,as, nligiiS, llSUrtE,, and so forth. Steeped in lust and savagely cannibalistic, they scheme to take over the whole universe by inducing Mahdvara himself to lead them. Mahdvara agrees but is too busy making love to Kalaratri to commit himself personally, and so he sends twenty-four stone lingas to be installed in the p~thas by which he can be wor-shipped vicariously. In response to this dire situation, Vajradhara (taking the form ofHeruka on the summit of Mount Meru) causes the emanation of the CakrasaJ!lvara maQ<Jala with himself as its lord. He presses Bhairava and Kalaratri beneath his feet so that they gain enlightenment, and then emanates the twenty-four pairs of heroes and cjakinis who subdue the evil spirits and gods in the twenty-four sites. In this account, the Saiva deities are tamed through \"subduing,\" \"enjoying,\" and \"absorbing\" (Kalff ibid:73). They are subdued in body when their victors take over their names and physical appear-ance, throwing them down and pressing them underfoot; in speech, by the appropriation of their mantras, which are transformed by the insertion of O'!' at the beginning and hu'!' hu'!' phil! at the end (cf. V ajravarahi Stit/hana §33); in mind, by realization of the void of nonconceptual awareness. Tam-ing by \"enjoying\" consists in sexual yoga as the heroes copulate with the con-sorts of the vanquished gods, while sporting their bone ornaments, skull staff, and other attributes, and sitting upon their corpses as thrones. \"Absorbing\" is firstly the complete purification of their obscurations and then the fusing of their minds with the dear light of nonduality. Bu stan's account is typi-"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA cal of the Cakrasaqtvara versions of the myth, which are based around the battle for the p~thas. The viaorious Buddhist heroes not only t2k.e their adver-saries' luiptililuz attributes and their consorts, but strip them entirely of their identities by assuming the exact guise of their conquered foes. Individual Saiva gods are no longer revived to serve in the Buddhist mai}Qala, as in the earlier myths, but survive merely as thrones for Buddhist deities who have appropriated their cosmic status, mantras, and outward forms. The myth of subjugation lends another dimension to the Buddhist reliance upon tantric Saiva norms and methodology (p. 37 ff.). For although on their own level the myths clearly express the transcendence of the Bud-dhist tantras over the Saiva, they look suspiciously like a \"doctrinal apology\" (Sanderson 1995) for \"an area of Buddhism so subjugated by Saivism that it has become little more than a Buddhist reflex of that religion., As apolo-getics go, however, they were a powerful means oflending legitimacy to the Buddhist tantric systems. At the same time, they declared Buddhism's inde-pendence of Saivism by the simple trick of demonizing it. Above all, the Buddhist function of the Saiva models is never in doubt (Sanderson 199.-p, 1995). As in the method of subjugation by absorbing described above, the purpose within Buddhism is to conven Saiva 'irreligion' by purifiying it of its wrong views, and bringing it within the orbit of universal enlightenment. The motivation is compassionate, and the myths are an uncompromising expression of skillful means. Throughout the higher and highest tantras, we sec Buddhism confidently imposing its own doctrines and theory onto the underlying Saiva framework. This process is dearly illustrated by the V ajravtirtihi Slilihana. where we will find that even such features as the Saiva p~thas are overcoded and correlated with the traditional formulations of the Buddhist path. In our account of the visualization ofVajravarahi herself, we have seen how her pan-tantric iconography is imbued at every step with a transcendental symbolism that is entirely Buddhist.m Armoring As the yogin has now imaginatively transformed his outer body into that ofVajravirihi, the next step is to transform his inner being also. He does this in two stages. First, he protects the body of\"himself-as-goddcss\" with an armor (ltawuam) of mantra syllables (v. 25-§6), and he then infuses it with transcendental knowledge (v. 26-§7). As we will see, the deity's outer form and its internal essence are distinguished as two \"beings\" (sattvas): the"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi pledge being (samayasattvam) and the knowledge being (jnanasattvam), and the infusion of knowledge takes place as the two beings are visualized merging together as one. The process of armoring (kavacanam) serves as the preparation for this essential moment. (In contrast, some texts state that the yogin-goddess is first infused with knowledge and then armored, so that the armoring functions as a purificatory prelude to the following consecration. )196 v. 1sa--c, In the Vajrayogini tradition, the yogin-as-goddess performs the armor-§6 ing with a placing or \"installation\" (nyasa/.1) of six pairs of mantric syllables at six points on his/her body. The verse in the Vajravarahi SaJhana (v. 25) is based upon a scriptural citation that often accompanies the syllables, and that names the parts of the body upon which, or within which (the loca-tive is ambiguous) the armoring syllables are to be placed: navel, heart, mouth, head, crown, and all limbs \"as the weapon\" (astram).'91 In some sadhanas, the armor syllables may take iconographical form as six armor goddesses. This is the case in the Abhisamayam4fijari, which states that \"because of the indivisibility of the mantra and the deity\" (mantratkvat4]tlr abhtdat), the meditator is to generate six ltapalilta god-desses. They all are disheveled with hair loose, naked, three-eyed, and stand-ing in the warrior stance. The goddess at the navel is a form ofVajravarahi herself. She is red, as usual, but she has three faces colored red, blue, and green. Her six arms hold, on her left, a skull bowl, staff, and noose, and on her right, a hook, Brahma's head, and chopper. The remaining armor god-desses are Yamini (blue-black), Mohini (white), Sarpcalini (yellow), Sarptrasini (green). and Uu}Qika (smokey-gray), who are visualized at the heart, mouth, head, crown, and \"all limbs.\" They have only one face and four arms. On their left, they hold skull and staff, and on their right, a ~maru and chopper.

This is because it omits a set of prescriptions that prepare the meditator for the armoring, by asking him first to purify (loJhay~t) or \"empower\" (atihiti!fh~t) all aspects of his/her pyschophysi-cal organism.

Although the Vajravlirtihi StltJhan4 eschews both the preparatory correlations and the empowerment (perhaps because they include male deities), these are important practices in the related texts. A commentator on the Yoginisa1Jicliratantra. for example, repeatedly remarks that the pur-pose of identifying the five buddhas with the sltanJhas is to destroy the \"ordinary idea of self\" (prfikrtliha1J1Itlira/.J) by taking on the \"divine idea of selr (lkvatliha1J1ltdrap). This is, of course, the process by which the tantric practitioner becomes \"united\" with his deity (lkvatliyogavan).••u Taken altogether, the stages of empowerment and armoring are also related to the body mat:tcJala described later in the V11jravarahi SdtJhana. The body mat:~Qala correlates deities with the yogin's internal and external being in order to identify him with the full mat:tcJala, a process that can be difficult to distinguish from the armoring.403 In some texts, the purifying correspondences (viludJhis) of body, speech, and mind (with 01JI 4[1 hu1J1) are also incorporated into the armoring meditation, a correlation that again points to the full mat:t9ala, with its three circles of body, speech, and mind (ltayacaltra, vliltcaltra. and cittacaltra).4/.)4 It seems that the armoring there-fore forms a specialized application of the broader themes of the body mat:t4ala. Its particular function is to prepare the yogin-deity for the infu-sion of knowledge that is to follow, and it is commonly distinguished by its use of mantra syllables and-in most texts-by the preceding empow-erment of the self-generated yogin's psychophysical being.

The pledge deity is the imaginary form of the goddess created by the \"pledge-holding\" initiate through the self-generation. In his Tantrtirthlivatllra, Buddhaguhya describes the pledge forms (samllyasattva/J, SllmllJilmll~m, samllyacaltram) as \"those [forms] discerned by persons pledged (*samayin) [to them] ... ones imagined as aris-ing from the body of a deity and as having the shape of a deity which the pledge person has generated in conformity with that [body of a deity], or imagined congruently with the latter's parts. \"405 Buddhaguhya describes the knowledge forms {jfuillllSilttVIlm, jfuinamllryjldam, jfilin.acaltram) as \"the self-existent (*svabhavin) discerned as deity.\" The knowledge being is said to have both form and \"inherent nature\" (mKhas grub rje: 235, citing the Paramtitlyatantra). The Vajravdrdhi Sdtihana now describes how the two \"beings\" are fused together to become one. The prose passage (§7) lists a traditional set of four mantra syllables, each of which has a particular function:• I. jab 2. Jtu, 3· Vll'!' 4· hob Summoning the knowledge being (alta'!lll)ll\"') Causing its entry into the pledge form (prawiaTIIlm) \"Binding\" of pledge and knowledge forms (banJhaTIIlm) Gratification of the fused forms (tO!Il!'/lm) In the previous verse (v. 26), however, the Vajravdrtihi StiJhana prescribes a slightly different procedure, one also common in other sadhanas: 1. Summoning the knowledge being (omitted in the Vajravlirtihi Sli/Jhana) 2. Worshiping the knowledge being (v. 26ab) 3· Causing its entry into the pledge form (v. 26c) 4· Merging of pledge and knowledge beings (v. 26d) In both the verse and prose, summoning or attraaion (tilta'!lll)llm) is the first step, and the yogin (that is, the yogin-as-goddess) must visualize the knowledge deity ofVajravirihi standing in space before him. One com-mentator explains that there are two kinds of summoning, \"invitation from the Dharmadhatu Palace of Akani~tha, and attraction from the worldly realms of the ten quarters\" (Padmavajra's Tantrtlrthdvatdravyalthyanaeited by Lessing & Wayman 1978: 236, n. 33). The first is reminiscent of the sadhana' s preliminary worship visualization and indicates that the knowl-edge deity is Vajravarahi in her sa,bhogaltdya form. The summoning of"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"168 VAJRAYOGINI deities from the ten directions is typical of the method used in the case of bali rituals, and indeed this is the ritual that generally provides the proto-type for the summoning here. Thus the meditator is instructed to summon the knowledge deity by uttering the syllable ph~phnn, making a hand ges-ture (muJra) at the forehead, and impelling the deities to descend with hooklike rays from the hean to the accompaniment of a scriptural verse (lt,rtvligragranthya ltha/u mm/hyasUci ... ; seen. sos)-the very prescriptions laid down for the bali ritual itself.407 Once summoned, the Vajravlirahi Stk/hana (v. 26ab) instructS the yogin to make offerings to the knowledge deity in the manner of the worship above (v. 4). The summoning and the worship are anyway interlinked, as Padmavajra actually explains summoning as \"the invitation by offerings\" (Lessing & Wayman op. cit.).408 In the case of the mantra syllables-jab hu'!' vam hob-it is the last syllable, hop, that is for worship, or \"gratify-ing\" (to!aiJilm). -tCY'J There is another well-attested tradition that states that hob is not for gratification, bur for the subjection and control of the deity. This is evidence of the power orientation typical of cremation-ground praxis and another reminder of the influence of the bali ritual}10 Padma-vajra (ibiJ. n. 36) seems to attempt a reconciliation between these two inter-pretations of hob by remarking that \"Subduing means making (them) rejoice, pleasing (them).\" The Vajravlirlihi Stklhanaends the verse by direct-ing the yogin to make the knowledge being enter into the pledge being (v. 26c) and \"bind\" the two of them together (v. 26d) (with the utterance of syllables hu'!'. and va1J1). The verse describes the fusion of the two beings as they mingle together, like water in water, or ghee in ghee. Elsewhere, texts describe them \"becoming one\" (~ltiltara'.\"l'!'• aJvaita-) or, in the words of Padmavajra, \"Tying means binding so there is no distinction between the evoker [i.e., the pledge form of the yogin-goddess] and the thing evoked [i.e., the knowledge deity]\" (ibiJ.: n. 35). Considering the overall structure of the sadhana, the infusion ofVajra-varahi' s outer form with knowledge is perhaps surprising. After all, the self-generation stage has already endowed her with the five wisdoms and shown her to be a reflex of the Jharmaltliya. This kind of repetition, however, is a hallmark of the sadhana, as it seeks to identify the yogin ever more indis-tinguishably with the essential nature of the deity. And it is this tendency that seems to have been at work in the evolution of the theory of different \"beings\" (sattvas), which has its roots in the yogatantras. The earlier mate-rial constantly expresses the urge to relocate the true essence of the deity in a more essential form. For example, in the sadhanas of Manju5ri, it is"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHi SADHANA common for a deity to be visualized with the form of another deity or syl-lable placed at its heart as its \"essence,\" \"nature,\" or \"source.\" In one instance, the text prc:scribes a visualization of the tathagatas with the bodhi-sattva Mafiju$ri at their hearts, and at the heart of Mafiju$ri himself the syllable 11 from which he was himself produced (altllras~~mbhlliHI/1) (Nilmll-mtlntrllrthllvaloltini in Tribe 1994: ch. 4). A is thus the most essential form of Mafiju$ri, and hence the \"limit of reality\" (bhut~tlto_tib).\"\" The same reductionist urge is expressed in yogonara sources (Isaacson 1996b) as a theory of three \"beings\": the pledge being (Sitmtl]llSilttrJil/1), knowledge being {jfitiNIS4ttvtzb), and meditation being (SilmlkihisilttVII/1). The pledge being bears the more essential knowledge being at its heart, and the knowledge being bears the even subtler meditation being at its heart. Thus, in the PiruJi/trllm4Stitlha1lll (vv. 91-92), the pledge being is a self-generated deity bearing six attributes; the knowledge being has the same form, but carries only the two most essential emblems; and the med-itation being is the seed-syllable in the heart of the knowledge being (Isaac-son: ibit1.).412 This seems to be the system bequeathed to the yoginitantras in the slighdy simpler twofold theory of the pledge and knowledge beings. 411 This type of visualization is depicted in art in the early fifteenth-century paintings at Gyantse, which show a series ofbuddhas with an eight-armed deity at their hearts and a two-armed deity within the hearts of each eight-armed deity (Ricca and LoBue 1993: plates 5-9). Cons~cration v. 2.7 The V lljravarlihi St1Jha1lll now directs the yogin to visualize enlightened --§8 beings bestowing consecration upon himself as Vajravidhi (v. 27-§8). The meditation begins once again with the emanation of the deities as the yogin-deity radiates light from the heart, which summons or impels them into the sky before him (§8). 414 Our author states in the verse that these enlight-ened beings are tathagatas (v. 2.7b), but in the prose passsage, he describes them as eight yoginis. As both tathagatas and yoginis are traditionally pres-ent at the consecration, it is not entirdy clear which our author has in mind. In the earlier Hevajra system, it is the tathigatas who administer the consecration, while ten attendant goddesses sing and dance in praise. m But in the Cakrasarpvara tradition, the tathigatas are summoned only in order to emanate the goddesses who will themselves bestow the consecration, or it is the yoginis alone who perform the ccremony.4'6 In the Vajrayogini"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi texts, the yoginis rise still further, and appear in the AbhisamtlJilTMfijari as a special class of ten consecration goddesses called vajravildsinis. 417 The shift toward feminine power is mirrored by an increasing emphasis on cremation-ground symbolism. Thus, the Vajravlirahi StiJhana describes how the yoginis pour out the \"nectar of innate knowledge\" (that is, the five nectars) onto the head of the yogin-as-goddess from the skull bowls they hold in their hands; whereas in Hevajra and most Cakrasa!pvara texts, the vessel is instead visualized as a ritual vase (lutWa/1).411 v. 17i As the enlightened beings pour the liquid, they recite a traditional accom-panying verse followed by the mantra 07!' sarvllt4thagatiibhif~ltasa1Nlyalriyt hu'!' (\"To the glory of the pledge [of?] consecration by all tathagatas!\").4'\" The verse (v. 27i) focuses upon the important purificatory function of the consecration, which is sometimes said to counteract ignorance and to wash away obscurations. In some sidhanas the liquid is imagined flowing through the yogin-deity's crown and filling him completely as it transforms into buddhas who transform all negativity whatsoever. no Here it gives rise to the buddha who seals Vajravarahi on her crown-in this case, Vairocana. The consecration in the sadhana is, of course, based on the actual rituals enacted by the guru when he consecrates a pupil into the praaiccs of the highest tantras. Such initiatory rites are divided into two types: the lower consecrations, of which there are usually five (pancabhi!~/ta!l). and the higher consecrations, often starring with the teacher consecration (licliryiibhif~ltaf1).421 For example, the first of the lower consecrations (the water consecration) begins with the pupil's request to his guru that he bestow the consecration upon him-an element also included in many sadhanas422-and the guru then sprinkles water from a vase as he recites an accompanying verse, exactly the same format as that in the sadhana. The influence of the teacher con-secration can also be seen, as this rite requires the guru to visualize the tathagatas bestowing the empowerment from a vase upon the head of a pupil who is already \"in union with his chosen deity\" (svq~tliyoga­yu/tt4!1); this is mirrored in the sadhana in all but the third-party interven-tion of the guru. The function of the teacher consecration is also significant. As the first of the higher consecrations, it permits and obliges the new vajrlicdrya to remain in union with his deity, to bestow consecrations upon pupils, and to progress to further esoteric consecrations, such as the taking of a conson for sexual yoga practice. Similarly, the consecration in the sadhana requires the yogin to preserve the form of the goddess (the conse-cration in HT1.4 actually ends with just this injunction: tkvatdmurtyd sthlitavyam), and it paves the way for meditations based on sexual yoga."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHi SADHANA 171 v. 2.8 The Vajrawirtihi Sidhana follows the consecration with typical acts of worship (v. 28ab) in which piija goddesses are visualized in space worship-ing the newly consecrated yogin-goddess, the practitioner as Vajravarahi. This verse also refers to a ritual of worship called the tasting of nectar (v. 28cd), although the rite's full exposition is reserved for the final section of the sadhana, which is devoted entirely to an explanation of the rituals of deity yoga. Innn-Yogic Practices vv. With the consecration, the process of self-generation is finally complete. 19-31, What follows in the sadhana is a series of contemplations based on the §9 seed-syllable or the mantras of the deity. They contrast to some extent with the visualizations of the generation (utpattib) by generally taking place within the subde yogic body that the yogin imagines, or experiences, inside his physical body. This type of meditation tends to be non-iconograhical, in that the objects of focus include visualized mantra syllables, colored \"drops\" within the yogic body, and the sensations caused by energies or \"winds\" moving within the yogic body. The principal aim of this type of meditation is finally to dissolve all visual and oral symbols of reality into reality itself and thus to bring about an experience of emptiness that is formless and void of any type of proliferation, whether visual, oral, or men-tal. This is a goal already familiar to practitioners of the Mahayana (paramitli\"\"J'lb), and as Germano (1994: 220) suggests, the tantric tech-niques that the yogin applies to achieving it \"can also be understood in part as attempts to formally incorporate the non-exoteric styles of meditation on emptiness (that were increasingly normative in orthodox monastic envi-ronments) into tantric practice and ideology.\" Such inner yogic practices are generally considered to contrast with generation-type meditations. In a distinction dating back to the eighth century and the Guhyasamtljatantra, the latter became known as the gen-eration stage and the former as the stage of \"perfection\" or \"completion\" (utpan111lkrllm4/1). A famous exposition of the completion method is Nagar-juna' s sixfold yoga (satjangayoga) developed in the yogottara exegetical tra-dition, and of partia.llar impo112ncc in the later Kalaakra system, as expounded by Naropa.•23 However, it is worth asking to what extent such labels apply within sadhana compositions themselves. Sadhana writers do, on occasion, refer to the yoga of the generation stage (utpattiltra7111lf11utpattikramayogaf1),"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi but they do not tend to make a distinction within the sadhana between those meditations revolving around self-generation and a subsequent \"per-fection stage\" involving the inner yogic practices--even if the latter evince features of what they may regard as perfection-stage praxis (GSS33 is an exception in our collection; see the appendix). Indeed, although most of our authors (although not necessarily all) were evidently aware of these classifications-and some, such as R.atnakara.Santi or Advayavajra, com-ment upon them elsewhere-what scholars/practitioners of the time actu-ally meant by the terms utpattiltram4 and utpannaltram4 is by no means as clear as current secondary literature makes out. In significant research on this classification, Isaacson (1999, 2001) has revealed the tremendous com-plexity of the distinction, and I can do no more here than summarize a few of his key findings (robbing them of the extensive bedrock of his citations from the early sources). The renowned scholar and tantrika Ramakara$anti explains the gener-ation stage as \"that stage or type of yoga (utpattiltramayoga/1) in which the yogin produces, in a series of steps, [himself in] the form of the deity\" (Isaacson's summary of the author's commentary on HnNZjratantra 1.8.24Cd-25ab in 2001: 470). The aim is ultimately to realize nondual emptiness, free of the mind's proliferation (prapanca/J), although to achieve this, the meditation itself relies on prescribed sequences involving just such prolif-eration. So much, it seems, was generally accepted by tantrikas of the time. Neverthdess, on the exact function of the generation stage, and on its value relative to the so-called perfection stage, \"there is evidence that there was a dispute, probably a long-running one\" (Isaacson 1999). Thus, while R.atnakara.Santi was content to see the utpattiltrama as a necessary prelim-inary for ensuing higher stages of practice, Isaacson also cites authors who were dismissive, even contemptuous, of it. A thornier matter still is deter-mining what exactly these higher practices were, and how they were to be classified. Again following Ramakara.Santi, Isaacson explains the perfection stage, or utpannaltrama. as the yoga of cultivating the sahaja or \"innate\" nature of the sadhaka himself, and of other beings. 424 It is called the innate nature, Ramakara$anti explains, in that it is \"[already] arisen,\" and \"does not need to arise or be produced ... \" (ibiJ.: 470). In other words, the deity already exists within the practitioner's deepest convictions (svdbhavika), and is thus already \"born\" (utpannaJ2~-dearly a process that no longer needs the meditative apparatus of generation, such as the five awakenings. Indeed, in RamakaraSanti's terms, it relies upon a cultivation or contempla-tion of a sensation of great bliss (m4hdsultham) that \"spreads throughout"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 173 the sidhaka's body, and then is to be imagined pervading the entire uni-verse\" (ibiJ.: ~71). There is little call here for iconographical visualization, and the chief tool for creating the experience of this bliss is a progressive form of sexual yoga moving &om imaginary, to symbolic, to actual prac-tice with a female conson. RamakaraSanti then goes on to refine the med-itations involved in the perfection stage, pinpointing both \"ordinary\" and \"extremely profound\" (paramagambhira-utpannllltrllm4) stages and stating that the latter is itsdf\"of many kinds\" (ibiJ.: 472). But as Isaacson points out, RamakaraSanti's was by no means the only voice in the debate, and other authors defined the perfection stage quite differendy. Advayavajra, for example, focused on its function as an accdcrated means of practice but maintained that it is still fully iconographic (ibiJ.: 471, n. 99). A sure indicator of the diversity within the categorization, definitions, and usages of utpatti and utpanna is the variety of terms relating to the subject. Isaacson (1999) has shown that the term utp4nnaltra1114, or \"per-fection stage,\" may be used interchangeably with nqpanNlkrllm4. (The term •SID!'pannaltrama • sometimes encountered in secondary literature is an anomaly, which Isaacson states docs not appear in any original Sanskrit source and appears to have crept in through another wrong back transla-tion from Tibetan.) In addition, the term nifpannaltrama may have been used by some, such as Candrakini and RamakaraSanti, to point to the term niglan1lll]Oga. This usage would have suggested to other scholars of the day a deliberate correspondence between the generation and perfection stages, and a different system of classification as found in the Mliylijailltantra, namely, a series of yogas called nifpanna-, Ita/pita-, and lllihinhana-yoga. Other authors clearly knew of the categories of the Maydjalatantra and preserved them in their writings, but without attempting to equate them with other systems around at the time. Abhayakaragupta, for example, opens his NigJanllll]og4Vali (Cyck ofCompktion Praaicn) with a direct ref-erence to the Mayajailltantras \"completion yoga\" (p. 1: yogo ni!panna/J) (ibiJ.). Other systems and terms were also current, and we have also already noted a category of inner yogic practices called the \"self-consecration,\" or svadhidhana method, which corresponds in type to aspects of the perfec-tion stage. My brief summary of Isaacson's research would be incomplete without pointing to his comments on the possible motivation for these early debates. In a unique observation, Isaacson (1999) cites the earliest known source for the distinction between utpatti and utpanna &om the GuhyasmNijatantra and reveals that it is unmistakably modeled upon Nagarjuna's declaration"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"174 VAJRAYOGINI of the rwo truths, a doctrine essential to Nagarjuna's philosophy, and key to the development of the ptiramitdnaya.426 Isaacson writes, \"such a con-sciow parallel therefore suggests that the distinction of the rwo ltramttS is an equally fundamental one for tanuic Buddhism.\" It is a correspondence, moreover, that is taken up by later tintrikas (e.g., Kif)ha YRM p. 104 gloss-ing HTI.I.I). But why should such distinctions be necessary? For Nagarjuna, the declaration of the two truths follows his assenion that all categories, including Buddhist ones, are empty. In the light of this, he needs to explain that on an \"ordinary\" level, Buddhism still requires its docuines and paths, and that these remain true and effective. In other words, \"the verse is actu-ally introduced to protect the lower (sa'!'Vftisat), not so much to justify the higher (paramlirthasat), [the filet of] emptiness, which has been established in the preceding chapters\" (ibid). Isaacson suggests that the parallel dis-tinction between generation and perfection stages serves a similar function. That is, the verse in the Guhyasamlijatantra protects or safeguards the teach-ings of the generation stage (which are after all the majority of tantric teach-ings) by proposing that they are a first stage, or a necessary preliminary, to the higher practices of the perfection stage. This way of framing the (tantric) teachings means that they arc now being expressed in terms of a path, to be trodden step-by-step in hierarchical sequence. The introduction of a tantric \"path\" at the time of the Guhyasttm4jlll4ntra was, Isaacson proposes, moti-vated by the contemporary debate between gradual and subitist approaches to enlightenment, which he shows the Arya school of the Guhyasamlija-tantra to have taken very seriously. The inner yogic practices of the sadhana, as we have just seen, move beyond the iconographical visualizations of the self-generation and focw on experiences produced inside the meditator's body. This depends upon a complex analysis of the internal, subtle, or \"yogic\" body into \"channels\" or \"veins\" (n#is) and \"body centers\" (cakras), a topic well documented in published sources on the highest tantras. m In brief, there are three main channels within the torso about a quarter of an inch in diameter. The cen-tral channel in particular is understood to be very straight (so that it can convey airs and liquids), soft like a lotw petal, bright and translucent, and either red or blue in color. It runs from the tip of the sexual organ, or at a point between the genitals and the anw, up to the top of the crown, usu-ally curving down from there to the point between the eyebrows. The side channels join the central channel at the navel and run up parallel with the central channel to the crown, where they curve away on each side to the two nostrils; they are a little thinner than the central channel. The channels"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 175 arc known as ~~t~adhuti (center), rasanli (right), Witnti (left), and together they serve as conduits for a series of inner \"winds,\" or energies. There arc different kinds of winds, which arc vehicles for different kinds of con-sciousness or mind, and those in the outer channels arc understood to be impure, while those in the central channel arc pure. Their flow is consid-ered vital to the healthy functioning of the body. The three main channels are assisted by 120 principal channels and 72,000 subsidiary channels that circulate the winds through the rest of the body. Normally, the winds arc unable to enter the central vein because the two side veins twist around it at four vital points, like knots, obstructing their flow. These points are the four cakras (literally, \"circles,\" but variously translated \"plexus,\" \"centers of veins,\" \"psychic centers,\" etc.). They are placed along the central chan-nel, and depending on the yogic system followed, they arc located at the head, throat, heart, and navel, or at the head, heart, navel, and sex organ, and arc represented by different kinds oflotuses. The three main veins also carry a flow of\"nectar\" between the cakras, namely, urine in 111141111 (cf. n. 217; or sometimes male semen), blood in rasanli (the female \"semen\"), and semen, or bodhicitta, in avadhuti (sometimes understood as the fusion of the male and female components, wisdom and means; Tsuda 1974: 63). The purpose of yogic meditations is to bring the winds from the outer channels into the central channel, avaJhUti. The winds are said to do this naturally at death, so the yogin's ability to manipulate them at will indi-cates his transcendence of death. The section on completion methods in the Abhisllmt~yamaiijari includes prescriptions for such a practice (although it refers to the visualization of the complete IJW}9ala rather than the sin-gle deity as in the Vajravarlihi StiJhana). Here the yogin is to use his absorp-tion in the va'!' syllable (or its subde sound, the Nit.l4) to manipulate the flow of the outer winds. When he causes the upward wind (here, prli'.\"lb> and downward wind to enter avaJhUti, an experience of intense heat rises through the channel from the navel, characterized as the fire, cli!'f!a/i (also understood as the red, female essence).lts blazing causes the nectar (bodhi-dttam. or male essence} visualized in the topmost cakra to melt, and as it docs so, it flows down and blissfully pervades the four cakras in tum. Thus, the yogin is said to experience four kinds of \"joys\" or \"blisses\" (lillllndas) that culminate in the highest kind of bliss, sahaja or \"innate\" bliss. In this blissful state, dualistic perception is said to be transcended:~28 If he is unable to fix his mind firmly on so big a mar.t9ala circle for a long while, then, [he should] make the mind become firm"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi [by focusing on the ntidtz, that is,] on the ray of light in the form of a thread of lotus fiber from the va'!' seed[-syllable], which [he visualizes] in the space between the sun and moon disks on the lotus at his navel.

The Abhisamayam4fijari goes on to describe how the entire world, the cre-mation grounds, the ma~Qala and its goddesses, and the yogin himself (self-visualized as Vajravarahi) each dissolve into each other so that only the va'!' remains. This also dissolves away, staning from the lowest pan of the syllable, so that only its uppermost panicle, the ntidtz, remains, but with a form so subde that it is imperceptible.429 This reaffirms the yogin's inner experience of nonduality, expressed here in terms of the \"highest point\" (bhutaltofib), clear light (prabhasvara/J), or yugaNJJJha-\"the fusion of the pair (emptiness and radiance)\" (see n. 281):•~ He should also see that ndJa as having the form of a one-hundred thousandth part of a hair tip, but not even that is per-ceptible, due to its extreme [subtlety].

It is this kind of meditation that the V ajravllrtihi Slidhana now describes. The verses describing the yogic med-itation (vv. 29-31) arc supplemented by a fuller prose description (§9). This explains how the mantra is to be simultaneously recited and visualized in coordination with the incoming and outgoing breaths. First, the yogin visualizes a moon disk at his navel cakra, upon which he sees Vajravarahi's seed-syllable Vll'!J (or the subtler naJJz). He then begins to recite her mantra in its ten-syllable form (O'!J vajravairocaniyt svahi). As he exhales, he sees the syllables of the mantra leaving the Vll'!J seed-syllable (i.e., breathing out \"through\" his navel). Through his ongoing recitation, he produces a great multitude of syllables, which irradiate the world as goddesses (probably still in syllabic form) for the benefit of all beings. As he breathes in, the yogin visualizes himself inhaling the mantra. Although our text docs not say so, the syllables must now be understood to enter his mouth and descend down the central channel, avatlhiiti, until they reach his navel. There they are absorbed back, taking on the form once again (v. 29c) of the seed-syllable Vll'!J (or the Nit/4), ready for the next exhalation of sylla-bles from the navd. This process of circulating the syllables is said to be like \"drawing in a thread\" (§9) or like \"counting the thread of a rosary\" (GSSs, cited later). This yogic practice also gives rise to the experience of dear light (v. 31d). A slightly fuller paralld to our text appears in the Abhisam4Jamafljari (following the meditations on the winds cited earlier). As it assumes the prior generation of the entire maQ4ala, this passage offers the yogin the option of using one of the mantras for the goddesses of the retinue (mantras that are only described in the later meditation stages of the Vajravirihi SdJhana). It also offers alternative methods of visualizing the syllables, including their circulation in the reverse direction, so that instead of flowing from the mouth down to the navel, the yogin sees them mov-ing up the avaJhiiti, out of the mouth, and back into Vajravarihfs body, via her sex:01 When he becomes tired, he should make his mind enter the Vll'!J syllable on the lotus at his navel, [and] simultaneously reciting either the heart or the auxiliary heart mantra described below (one of the two according to his [own] wishes), he should emanate the five [maQ4ala] circles from the ntiJa of that {va7J1}"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINI syllable, with the outgoing breath, and make them benefit the [entire] world.

There are, in fact, two versions ofVajravarahi' s heart mantra.

But in the tantras it usually refers to the supernormal or magical powers that initated practitioners of tantric deity cults are able to develop. These include both white and black magic (although the Indian scheme uses a different color coding), the four most basic being the siddhis of welfare (fantip), of increase or restoring to health (puuiJ;). of subjugating a victim (vali/tara1_11Zm), and of causing death (mlira!\"''!')· Other powers include drawing victims toward one (aka'!fl!\"'m), paralyzing them (stambhanam), and driving them away (uccll.tanam).

In his practice, the four goddesses on the petals generally appear with the same iconographic form as they have in the Vajravarahi maJ)cJala, despite dramatic changes to the central cult figure. Variations relate principally to whether they are two-or four-armed. Occasionally they assume a more radical form, as we have seen in the sadhana of the twelve-armed Vajravarahi redacted from the AbhiJhanottaratantra (GSS7), where they take the terrifiying theri-anthropic form characteristic of that m:u:t<Jala, trampling the corpses of Bhairava and Kalaratri in arJhaparyanluz pose, and holding a severed head (rather than the tjAmaru of VajravdrahisdJhana). 445 The four retinue goddesses are representatives of ideal classes of female. The yoginitantras have a special interest in characterizing and categorizing such types as consorts for sexual yogic practices. The Sa'!'varodayatantra (ch. 31), for example, describes the \"beautiful characteristics\" of l)akini, Lama, Kh:u:tcJaroha, and Rupini, their physical attributes, character, voice, and smell, and the way of making love to them. Female types are divided into classes and, according to their attributes, belong to particular buddha families. A nine-point~ vajra on the lower joint of the fourth finger, for example, is said to indicate a member of the .Alqobhya family (HT2.2.1-2). The AbhiJhanottara has chapters dedicated to the classes of yoginis, ~. Iimas, and others; and Kalff (1979: 44-56; cf. 91-95)-who discusses this area in detail-suggests that the goddesses Rupi~i and Kh~<Jaroha (some-times interchangeable for Lama) also arose from among these generic clas-sifications.446 As individual goddesses, the goddesses of the petals therefore assume a generic quality associated with their type. l)akini represents all cJilcinis, and never appears as an individual goddess outside this set; Lama represents all lamas, and so on-in fact, these two only appear as classes of female within the Caltrasa,varatantTa itself-and in this respect, the god-desses are akin to Vajravm.hi, the supreme vajra-yogini. Their kinship is noted in the AbhiJhdnottaratantTa: l)akini is described as a vajra-cJikini who has \"arisen in the family of Vajravarihi\"; the chapter on lamas describes the characteristics of \"lamas who are varihis, .. while the com-mentary adds that lamas belong to \"the varahi family\" or \"family of varahi' s good qualities. \"447 Another chapter describes the \"practice of the four cJilcinis\" (ADUT ch. 19 Caturtjdltiniyogapata/tz) in which the goddesses are visualized with three fitces and eight arms, trampling four micas, and with the vajra prefix to their mantras (\"vajra-Qakini,\" etc.).

Four of the goddesses are visu-alized at the gates (dvliram), that is, at the four central ponicoes of the tem-ple palace (see plate 12 with fig. 32). They are terrifying in form, with \"faces to match their names\"(§14): a crow's head for Kakasya, an owl for Ulukasya, a dog for Svanasya, and a hog for Siikarasya. Otherwise, their accoutrements and stances resemble those of the goddesses on the petals, and like them, they are four-armed and carry skull staff and skull bowl in their left arms, and rjamaru drums and choppers in their right. Their colors, we must assume, are those of the cardinal directions in which they reside: black, green, red, and yellow.44' (Plate 1 shows therianthropic attendant goddesses with two arms. In plate 14, the goddesses are visible at the gates.) In the intermediate directions (installed counterclockwise), the medita-tor visualizes four more goddesses in each corner (ltotuZ~) of the maiJ9ala where the walls intersect. These are the fearsome yoginis of the god of death, Y ama:•w Y amada4hi, Y amadiiti, Yamadaql~!ril')i, and Y amamathani. They are similar in every other way to the gate goddesses except that they are human-faced and are bitonal because they straddle two directions of space. All eight outer goddesses are sealed by Amoghasiddhi, and their mantras fol-low the format of the other goddesses of the retinue (o1f1 + name element + hu'!l hu'!l phaf). No additional mantras are given for Vajravarahi at this stage, which suggests they remain the same as those for the fivefold maiJ4ala: heart, auxiliary heart, and eight-part mantras. The outer goddesses have already made an appearance in the Vajravtirtihi SaJhana during the installation of the circle of protection (v. 15fT.), where they took on a stakdike form for staking, hammering, and removing obsta-des. Here, their theriocephalic forms again indicate their protective func-tion, following a trend set in the earliest yoginitantras. For example, the *Guhyaltofa describes a maiJ9ala of fifty-eight wrathful deities surrounding Buddhaheruka and his conson Buddhakrodhdvari, in which there are eight theriocephalic divinities (phra mm ma)and four \"gate keepers\" (*dvaraptilis), 186"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA plus an outer circuit of twenty animal-headed deities (Sanderson 1995).

In other texts, however, the terms seem to vary. In the AbhiJhanottaratantra, for example, the term \"pledge circle\" (sa1111tJa-caltram) covers (both individually and collectively) the central goddess, the petal goddesses, and the outer goddesses, and therefore seems to be used synonymously with \"circle of great bliss.\" Other terms are also found. The goddesses in the outer reaches of the maJ]Qala are frequently said to reside in the \"outer circle\" (btihyacaltram) (e.g., GSSs Sed p. 136, Kl.3V3), while in the AbhiJhanottaratlmtra, we also find the fivefold central ma~gala referred to as the vagina (bhagafJ), and the lotus petals distinguished as the knowledge circle {jliliN«altram).m The origin of these terms is not alto-gether clear. 453"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"MEDITATION STAGE 4 Thirty-srom-fo/J Ma!Jtfala §16 At the stan of the founh meditation stage. our author once again cites the scriptural verse (v. 37) as the source for the meditation.

With the addition of these twenty-four goddesses, the thirty-seven-deity ma1]9ala of Vajravarahi is complete. In this meditation suge, the Vajravdrahi saJhana first states how to visualize the three circles with their twenty-four goddesses (§16-§21), then gives instructions for a series of meditations on the mal}4ala (§22-§31), and ends in the usual man-ner with the mantras (§32-§34). Through these descriptions, we will sec how successive layers of meaning and significance are woven into the completed mai]9ala so that it represents or \"becomes\" transcendental wisdom (the DW)4ala as wisdom), the thiny-seven boJhipalqiluuiharmas (the Mal}4ala as doctrine), and the body of the meditator himself (body m~4aJa, ltaya-ma'.V!tzla).

If we compare the structure ofVajravarahi's maqQala with that of Cakrawpvara, we find that the two mai}<Jalas are identical except that in the maqQala ofVajravarahi all the male gods have been removed. The maq4ala leader, Cakrasaf!lvara, has been superseded by his consort, Vajravarahi, and the goddesses appear alone in the twenty-four sites, thus reducing the size of the mai}<Jala from sixty-two to thirty-seven deities. This adaptation of the Cakasa.rpvara mai}<Jala to a new, all-female modd is not without its problems. We will see later how it creates inconsistencies in the meditations that correlate the full maq<Jala with the body, and how mantras must be adapted to omit the names of the male gods. §10 The next prose passage reveals the f.uniliar lttiptililta character of the site goddesses. They each have one face and four arms, and hold the same implements as the other retinue goddesses: skull bowl and staff (left) and chopper and r!tz1Nl1'U (right). They stand in the warrior stance without a corpse throne and wear the five tantric ornaments and a garland of\"hang-ing human heads.\" Their colors are determined by the color of the circle in which they dwell, itself a rdlcx of the buddha who presides over it. Thus, the goddesses on the mind circle, sealed by Alqobhya, are blue-black; those on the speech circle, sealed by Amitibha, are red; and those on the body circle, sealed by Vairocana, are white. Some of the names of the site god-desses are strikingly un-Buddhist, reflecting the influence of esoteric ~ . . ·~~ ;)aJVJSlll. §2.1 The following paragraph repeats the installation of the eight outer god-desses. These protective goddesses have already been visualized in the third meditation stage, where they were located at the \"gates• and \"corners\"-suggcsting the traditional structure of the temple palace walls (§I}-§Is).

Another explanation may be the ambiguous pres-ence of the temple palace in this sadhana. Umipatideva never actually prescribed the visualization of the temple palace. Instead, he located the self-generation within the setting of the cremation grounds (v. 16); and even when he offered the traditional alternative of Mount Mcru, we noted that he omitted any reference to the temple palace (v. 35). The location he prescribes here for the outer goddesses-the cremation grounds sur-rounded by protective rings of fire and wind-in fact harks back to their visualization earlier in the sidhana, when they appeared in the construc-tion of the circle of protection (at §4). If this cosmological orientation is an original contribution by Umipatideva (and it is absent in the other sources studied here), it is consistent with his attempt to replace the cakravartin-stylc architecture of the maJ)Qala palace with the cremation grounds. Clearly following, and adapting from, his CakrasaJ!lvara sources, our author ends his prescriptions in §21 with a final comment covering all the goddesses in the retinue, stating that all of them arc to be visualized wear-ing chaplets of vajras.451 It is at this point that the Abhisamayamaftjarl (GSSs Sed p. 139. K26rs) offers alternatives to the visualization of the full mat)4ala, which are credited to the Vajravali by the author's guru, Abhayi-karagupta.

Next, we have seen that the three mat.t9aJa circles of mind, speech, and body are tiered according to the popular division of the world along its vertical axis. This is usually understood as the division of the three worlds (tribhuvanam) of space, earth, and underworld, as in the Abhisamayamali-jari (GSSs K28r6).

By comparing the cosmological structure of our mat.t9ala with that of the Kalacakra, it also reveals how me Vajravdrahi Sddhana seems to foreshadow that system, in which the cosmos is gener-ated upon the elements air, fire, water, and earth (see also fig. 25)."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 195 Table 21.

These, as we have seen, are understood to exist within the me199ala, on the three circles of mind, speech, and body, with eight sites on each. The sacred sites have their origins in Saiva myth, which relates how Siva's body was dismembered and fell to eanh (or how Siva scattered the dismembered body of Sati/Par-vati across the world in his grief), thus creating sites of sacred power.462 The existence of these sites here in the Buddhist tantric systems has its root in the accounts of Siva's subjugation, which-as we saw earlier-generally begin with Mahe5vara' s (Siva's) demonic tyranny of the universe and end with his defeat and conversion at the hands of the Buddhist heroes. In Cakrasarp.vara exegetical literature, however, Mahesvara' s overlordship is represented specifically in terms o~his occupation of the twenty-four sacred sites, while his subjugation is framed in terms of the Buddhist takeover of those sites from the wicked gods of his me199ala retinue. The inclusion of the sacred sites in the meditation and ritual texts of tantric Buddhism is also due to its \"pious plagiarism\" of tantric Saiva methods, in particular, the eso-teric system of the Trika (Sanderson 1994b, 1995).463 Kalff (1979: 103-4) states that the names of most sites are those of towns or countries \"from almost every part of India,\" while the actual pilgrimage sites are holy sanc-tuaries within those countries-predominantly ofKali-type deities.464"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINi The significance of the sacred sites within the maJ]Qala is that they con-firm the maJ)Qala \"as\" the universe. This plays a vital pan in the coming meditations, in which the maJ]Qala as cosmos is correlated with the body of the meditator. Th~ T~n Plac~s (tkfas) In the meditations that follow, yet another aspect of the cosmos is woven into the symbolic textures of the ma~9ala. This is a set of ten \"places\" (tklas) made up of five primary places, and five secondary or \"nearby\" places. Each of the places contains two or four of the twenty-four sacred sites (vv. 43-53), as shown in table 23. The places are correlated during the course of the body maJ]Qala with the ten bodhisattVa stages (vv. 43-53). They also appear within a slightly different, twelvefold account in the Hevajra system.46~ These are summarized in table 22.466 In the semi-mythical world of the highest tantras (and drawing once again on Saiva praxis), the places and sites serve as dwelling places for var-iow classes of yogini. Such texts devote some time to explaining the means of identifying and conversing with these types of women, as in a passage from the Sa'flvaroti4yllt4ntra: \"A woman who is always fond of meat and spirituous liquors and forgets shame and fear is said to be an 'innate woman' (sahaja) born of the 9akini family. They are born in each district [i.e., place]; (these) yoginis should be worshiped at all times. \"467 The idea is that the yogin should visit the places in search of his conson. The lord himself, in the H~vajratantra (1.7.8-u), specifically refers to them as the \"meeting place\" (m~llipaltasthanam) for yogins and yoginis who know the \"secret signs\" (choma). The texts clearly suppose that the places and the sacred sites that they contain have a real, external existence because, on occasion, they make derogatory remarks about such goings-on, complaining that the expen yogin need not \"tire himself out by wandering around the twenty-four sites in person,\" and emphasizing that the sites are mentioned merely \"for the benefit of simple fools who wander about the country. \"461 Within the maJ]Qala as a whole, the different cosmological systems do not fit easily together. A comment by Bu ston illustrates this. In his account of the subjugation of the Saiva gods (quoted by Kalff 1979: 68--69), Bu ston first describes the Buddhist occupation of the Saiva sites and then states that four kin11Jlris and four phra mm ma take control of the eight great crema-tion grounds.

Within the mal)gala of the Vajravdrahi Sadhanawe can also see evidence of some competition between the different systems. For example, the cremation grounds are one of the categories of place, and as such appear on the body circle (see table 23. This is awkward for the overall scheme of the mal)gala, in which they are other-wise located beyond the outer circle, within the circle of protection. Table 22.

The practice involves correlating the mal)gala as cosmos with the practitioner's own body. This type of purifying equation (vifud-dhip)-of a divinity with an aspect of the yogin's body-has already appeared in the sadhana, first as a preliminary purification of the practi-tioner's psychophysical organism, and again as the armoring. In some scrip-tural sources, the correlations of the body mal)gala serve to generate the mal)gala directly within the body without any prior generation (e.g., in ADUT ch. 9). Indeed, mKhas grub rje defines it as a means of self-gener-ation ranking above that of the generation method (utpattikramap) and completion method (nifpannakramap).469The Yoginisa1Jlcdratantraempha-sizes the importance of the practice in the Cakrasa111vara tradition by ascrib-ing it to the mythical Lakttibhidhanatantra (although the practice was in fact Saiva in origin).470 §30 The method of producing the body mal)gala is described in an explana-tory prose paragraph. This explains that the yogin must begin by uttering (and visualizing) the seed-syllable for the site, which is created from its first syllable (e.g., pu for Pulliramalaya) with the added nasalization of the"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"VAJRAYOGINI anusvdra {puiJI). He should then see the seed-syllable transforming into an empty circle that is understood to represent Pulliramalaya itself (and so on for all twenty-four sites). Simultaneously, the yogin installs the empty circle, Pulliramalaya, on a certain point on his body (in this case, his head), as shown in figure 33· Meanwhile the goddess Pracal)<:li. who dwells within the site, is transformed into a channel or vein (Nif/i) inside the head. The placing of each site on a body point relocates the external world or cos-mos symbolized by the mai)Qa1a \"on\" or \"in\" the meditator's body, so that his body actually becomes, or contains, the world of the sacred sites and places. In this way, the body mal)~ala internalizes the yogin's prac-tice of actually wandering through the sites and places in the real world in search of a consort. It is to be undertaken by an \"internal yogin\" (aJhyatmJZyogin GSSs) and is deemed to be superior to ordinary external pilgrimage. 4'1 vv. 43-s4 The purifying equations of the sites and their goddesses with points on the yogin's body are given in a series of verses. After each verse, the text gives a one-line description allocating the sites to the ten places, and cor-relating those with the ten bodhisattva stages. These are summarized in table 23. The vertical division of the cosmos into three (or four) \"worlds\" also transfers to the body through the processes of the body mai)Qala. Once again, the correlations are somewhat approximate. The sites of the mind circle, equated with the sky, relate to points of the body around the head and shoulders. The sites of the central circle, the speech circle, are associ-ated with earth (the central world), and this is roughly correlated with the midpoints of the body (the tip of the nose and mouth are also included in this set). The sites of the body circle (usually associated with the lower world) are equated with the lower body. Although in the Vajrayogini tra-dition the body m3J)Qala should be undertaken by the yogin who imagines himself as the goddess (fig. 33a), the correlations with the body points fit more naturally upon a figure seated in meditation (fig. 33b), perhaps an indication that the practice first arose outside the systems of deity yoga. For example, the body points for the hands and feet are grouped together for a figure seated in meditation, but are forced apart for the body standing in warrior stance. Above all, the preservation of the sixteenth body point \"penis\" (mttforam) is an anomaly if the meditator is visualizing himself in female form. By verse 53, our author has finished describing how to install the sites and site goddesses (i.e., the circles of mind, speech, and body) onto the"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 199 meditator's body, and he has correlated those sites with the ten places and ten bodhisattVa stages. Verse 54 appears only as a marginal insertion in one manuscript, com-menting on the value of the correlation with the ten bodhisattva stages (sec Textual Notes). vv. In the following couple of verses, our text widens and extends the prac-ss-s6 rice by equating other points of the body with the outer goddesses (v. 55) and the goddesses of the four petals (v. 56). This is not entirely faithful to the original method of the body maJ)9aJa, in which a body point should correlate with one of the twenty-four sites. It is also difficult to see any par-ticular rationale governing the new body points (except perhaps that the petal goddesses are located at the heart), especially since the parallel corre-lations in the Abhisam4Jamafijari {GSS5) seem just as haphazard, and only vaguely related to those offered by the Vajravdrahi S4tiha111l.472 These incon-sistencies arise in the Vajrayogini tradition because of its adaptation from the Cakrasaqtvara practice. There, the correlations of the body maJ)Qala applied to the body of the twelve-armed hmJta in embrace with his con-son (e.g., Abhitihanottaratantra ch. 9), in which scheme the four petal god-desses and eight outer goddesses were installed on the twelve handheld attributes of the male god. Since these arms and attributes are absent in the self-generated form ofVajravarahi, those goddesses are left without a clear function in her body maJ)9aJa. Another inconsistency in the Vajrllvarahi sadhantl (as in the AbhisamayamAfijllri) is that our author is forced to reduce the body maJ)Qala by not including the more subdc aspects of the yogin's psychophysical body {sec table 9). The psychophysical body points were correlated with male deities in the Cakrasarpvara maJ)Qala and arc therefore inadmissable in the all-female Vajravarahi maJ)Qala. None of the correlations given here ovcrdy explains the designations of the maJ)Qala circles themselves as \"mind circle,\" \"speech circle,, and \"body circle.\" However, this correlation of the maJ}Qala with the fundamental division of the person demonstrates, on the simplest level, that the maQ4aia as a whole is understood to \"be\" the practitioner. Conversely, the practi-tioner \"is\" the maJ}Qala and thereby embodies not only the chosen deity, but her entire retinue and the worlds in which they dwell. §31 The correlations of the body ffiat}Qala also incorporate the subde yogic body in the form of the channels or veins (nt¥is). At §30, our text stated that the channels are to be established through the \"transformation\" of the site goddesses. In other words, the site goddesses dwell \"within\" the sites identified at a particular point on the body (e.g., Pracat}Qi within Pulliraya-"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"200 Fig. 33· Body ma~la. with VAJRAYOGINI Table 23.

Tantric sources commonly refer to the goddesses \"as\" the channels or veins. m The Vajravdrdhi Sadhana makes only an oblique reference to the function of the channels within the body mat)Qala: The channels are said to be like rivers that \"nourish\" the sites and so on in the external world \"with water., The nourishing fluid that flows in the chan-nels in the meditation (like the water in the rivers) is not referred to here, but according to the Sa'!'varodayatantra (ch. 7, vv. 16-18), the contents of the central channels are urine (in /a/anti), blood (in rasana) and semen (in avadhuti). Another analogy (in §31) touches upon the soteriological significance of these yogic correspondences; for just as, in the external world. the river Nirafijana nourishes the site of enlightenment (vajrapifpam) upon which the Buddha sat, so in the internal \"yogic world.\" the central channel avadhuti nourishes the circle of great bliss upon which Vajravarahi stands. In the Cakrasaf!1vara version of the body maQQala, on which the Vajra-varahi materials are based, the function of the channels is more explicit. In that system, the twenty-four male gods on the sites (consorts to the site god-desses) are said to represent or \"purify .. certain aspects of the body. For example, PraCat)Qa' s consort, Khai)Qakapalin, becomes the nails and teeth; the channel (Pracai)Qi herself) carries nourishment from the head (Pulliramalaya) to the nails and teeth (Kh31)Qakapalin).474 The NVfzis there-fore a \"channel\" (vaha/vahini; that which flows, samdvaha-/vahati) &om an external point on the body \"through\" the related aspect of the body, thereby nourishing it.

The fourth meditation stage ends with the mantras to be inserted within the sadhana, as in the first meditation stage. First, our author gives the root mantra (mulltmantrllp) for Vajravarahi as leader of a full maJ]Qala, adding it to her mantras for earlier stages of the practice (namely, the heart, aux-iliary heart, and eight-part mantras). The root mantra is full of terrifying epithets, aggressive imperatives, fearsome laughter, and general clamor. §33-Next, the text supplies mantras for the site goddesses (§33). These con-§u tain cryptic mantric elements called \"vajra words\" (ltuliillpatlani) and owe their form to the mantras of the site gods in the Cakrasatpvara mai)Qala. Thus, in Cakrasaipvara sources, the mantras for the site god and the site goddess are listed side by side, as follows:419 O'!' kha1}1/4/taplili114 kara /tara hu'!' hii'!' phat svaha (for site god, Khai]Qakapalin). o'!' pr~~ea!'ffo hii'!' hu'!' pluzt sviiha (for site goddess, PfaCa99i). etc. Another Cakrasatpvara source, Luyipada's Hmdtabhisamaya (f. 13r), col-lapses the two mantras into one and omits the name of the male deity, thereby producing a version closer to the mantras given in the Vajravarahi texts: O'!' kllra /tara hu'!' hu'!' phat praca!\"ft hu'!' hu'!' phil!

These arc chiefly rites of worship and offering, but adapted for the context of deity yoga. A comment on the nature of tantric ritual in general is found in an oblation text in the GuhyasamayasiJhanamd/4 attributed to Indra-bhuti, the PraJiptihutiviJhi (GSS14). This draws on the ancient shamanic or magical understanding of ritual, namely that: \"X here produces Y there\" (v. 17): \"Such is the true nature (Jharmatii) of the worlds: for one who acts with intensity {lit: 'whose deeds arc sharp') it may be only a flower [that he offers] here, [but] in the next world it [bears] a great fruit. \"•so While ritual is a mechanistic process, it does not simply operate on an external plane. Indrabhuti describes how mental intention, too (sec p. 215), is a means to generate results (vv. 24-25): ''Whatever merit is dedicated with a mind firmly convinced, with whichever method, in whatever place, in whatever way, <fruit?> arises in a corresponding form, in a corresponding place, in a corresponding way, like the pot of a potter. \"411 In a Y ogacara-Madhyamaka environment, such promises arc made possible by the infinite possibilities of emptiness. Once appearances arc understood to be empty and thus unreal (in that they lack intrinsic existence), then they are no different from mag-ical appearances, which arc also empty and unreal. As Indrabhuti explains: (v. 26) \"Whatever he cultivates further, and whatever more is dedicated, that bears fruit, like a reflection in a mirror that is both real and not real,\" (v. 2.8) \"Only through the mind, not through anything else, docs one reson to the dualities 'good' (mym) and 'bad'; for saqtsara is nothing but the mind, and nirvil]a [too] is nothing but the mind.\"412 It is not the case, however, that the ontology of Mind-only renders external ritual actions meaning-less, as they arc justified on the basis ofNagarjuna's doctrine of two truths (cf. Bcntor 1996: 13-21). Although on the level of ultimate truth (para-mlirthtlsatyam). ritual action is empty, it is meaningful because it is under-stood to operate on the level of conventional truth (/oltasa'!'VTfisatyam). This is the basis upon which the yogin proceeds: (v. 22) \"The buddhas (muniivtlr/ib) say that with one hundred and eight oblations, [performed] on the basis of an understanding of the two truths, the fruit of universal monarch-hood or buddhahood [is attained]. \"413 The rites described by the V ajravarlihi Sadhana arc as follows: 105"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"206 (v. 57-§40) (vv. 59-66) (§41-§49) (§46) (§49) (§51) (§52) VAJRAYOGINI offering bali (balividhi/1) tasting nectar (am.rtdsviiJanam) external worship (btihyapiijti) hand worship (hastapiijti) alternative external worship (btihyapiijd) internal oblation (aahytit7nahomavidhi/J) rite for leftover bali (*uccchiffllbalividhi/J) Our text here is very similar to that of the Abhisamayamaiijari (GSSs), and both works base their prescriptions on rites described in Cakrasarpvara literature. Their comparison with a series of Cakrasatpvara rituals by Sasvatavajra (published by Finot in 1934 under the editorial title *Vu/hi-sa1Jigraha, Colkction of Rius) demonstrates how simple the redaction of material into the Vajravarahi corpus was. The *Vidhisa1Jigraha describes the same series of rites, but directs the prescriptions to the yogin in union with Cakrasatpvara rather than with Vajravarahi. Sasvatavajra' s descrip-tions of the rites are very similar to our author's and are almost identical with those of the Abhisamayamaiijari (GSSs). differing from the latter sometimes only in phrasing.

The offering of bali is essentially a brahmanical ritual, and probably predates the Vedas; such offerings cenainly form a large pan of Vedic prescription. ••~ A more imme-diate source for the Buddhist tantras is the bali offering in Saiva and Vai~l)ava rites, in which the bali is often a concluding rite.486 The Vajravtirdhi Sadhana introduces the bali ritual by stating that rites such as worship are to be preceded by bali offerings (v. 57).

Despite this careful apology, it is clear that bali rituals are usu-ally taught at the end of a text as a concluding rite (as well being a prelim-inary ritual), and perhaps his statement is best understood as a comment upon ritual within the highest tantras, in which self-generation is a pre-requisite to the performance of all rites. Tasting N~ctar (am.rtasvadanam) §3s As a preliminary part of the bali ritual itself the Vajravarahi Sdtihana teaches (cf. v. 28) the rite of tasting nectar (am.rtlisvtitianam). Earlier in the sadhana our author promised a description of this rite, because it was prescribed as pan of the worship following the consecration of the newly fledged yogin-deity (v. 28). The tasting of nectar is also prescribed in the parallel sources (Abhi-samayamaiijari and Caltrasa'!'varaba/ividhi), from which it seems that our texts arc incorporating an independent ritual of tasting nectar into the bali offering and using it to seJVe as a preliminary for that rite. ••• This is also the method employed in the Vajrava/i (SP f. 12017), in which Abhayakaragupta joins the two rites together by first describing an Amruzstidhana for the preparation of the nectar, and then relating how the bali should be offered according to the Samaja, Hevajra, and Cakrasarpvara systems. In contrast, the Advayavajra-based sadhanas clearly treat the tast-ing of nectar as a distinct rite of worship . ..., In some Guhyasa1flllJilSiltlha1111-mald texts, the two rites are simply sequential, the tasting of nectar first comprising an imaginary offering of nectar, and the subsequent bali, the offering of real (or imagined) foodstuffs with the recitation of bali mantras.•~ A hint in our texts suggests that our Cakrasarpvara-based bali rituals may be appropriating the tasting of nectar rite, and thus joining two inde-pendent rites together. In the Caltrasa'!'varabalividhi, the rite of tasting nectar requires the yogin to generate an imaginary bowl in which he will visualize various substances transforming into the nectarizcd offering. Because the independent bali ritual also requires a bowl for the food offer-ings, the text then prescribes the generation of a second-but now strictly unnecessary-offering bowl (also GSS16 cited n. 490: Jvitiya'!' ba/i-bhajanam).

It is particularly well suited to the bali offer-ings in the Cakrasaqtvara tradition, in that it describes an imaginary food offering resulting in great bliss, to be offered within the context of inter-nalized meditative performance. Moreover, it describes a handy means of purifying offerings that in our tradition are composed of transgressive sub-stances, and of transforming them into nectar fit for the gods. vv. The first step in the rite of tasting nectar is the preparation of a hearth, S~ whereon the food offerings may be cooked, purified, and turned into nec-tar. First, raging Oames are generated from the combination of wind and fire, represented by their elemental symbols and the syllables Jil1!l and ra'!' (v. 59). Above this, a hearth (cu/Jilui; v. 6ob) is then &shioned from three heads arranged like the base of a tripod; these are produced (in our tradition) from the syllable lta,.•91 On top rests a skull bowl generated from aft. as the caul-dron. 492 (See fig. 34.) Fig. 34· Inparation of ntctar."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"210 VAJRAYOGINI v. 61 The next verse {plus the following prose) describes the preparation of the nectar inside the cauldron. The ingredients are generated from seed-syllables and comprise the usual esoteric offerings, namely, the five nectars and the five meats, or \"lamps\" (pafica pradipas). The five nectars are semen, blood, flesh, urine, and feces, and the five lamps are the flesh of cow, dog, horse, elephant, and man. 4\"J The seed-syllables are not a very stable set, and the Advayavajra-based sources, for example, prescribe the generation of the ten transgressive substances from the five syllables of the buddhas alone.•?4 v. 62. Our author then describes the cooking process itself. The fire should be visualized blazing up and heating the ingredients and turning them bright red. The V ajravali (seemingly following Cakrasal!lvara scripture) adds that the ordinary color, smell, and potency of the ingredients are removed with the syllables ha ho hri~. 49~ v. 63 Next, a white, inverted skull staff is visualized above the mixture, pro-duced from hu1Jl. From its contact with the heat or steam rising from the liquid below, the skull staff melts and drips into the cauldron, cooling the red liquid and turning it white, or \"quicksilver,\" in the process.•')(, vv. 64-66 It only remains for the liquid to be empowered by the syllables 01Jl a!J hu1Jl. These three syllables are generated from the letters of the alphabet and visualized above the liquid. The syllables then emanate the deities of the mal}4ala into the universe to benefit beings. Finally, the deities arc retracted and dissolve into the three syllables, and the three syllables themselves dis-solve into the nectar below. The liquid is now empowered by the syllables and is complete. The meaning of this stage of the visualization is dearer in the parallel texts, which imply that the nectars and meats in the cauldron arc pledge forms, as they require the infusion of knowledge. In the Abhisamayamafijari, the three syllables emanate rays rather than deities, and these draw out the \"knowledge nectar in the hearts of all tathagatas. \"w The Caltrasa1Jlvara balividhi (based on both male and female deities of the Cakrasarpvara mal)4ala) reads as follows:4\"8 Next above that [liquid], [he should visualize] 01Jl a~ hii1Jl as transformations of the vowels and consonants, in sequence, one above the other. With the ray[s] emanated from those [three syl-lables], using the \"method of transferral\" (sa,.krama'}llnyay~na), he should draw down in the form of the three [mal}4a[a] circles (tricaltrakaram) [the \"knowledge\" forms of the \"pledge\" nectars and meats, namely] the \"knowledge nectars\" and \"knowledge"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHi SADHANA lamps\" {jfui111im.rtapradipa7!J) of the heroes and heroines in the ten directions .•. ,., Having [caused those deities of the three ma~<:iala circles] to accomplish the welfare of the world, he should visualize them (avalokya) first coming together [in sex-ual union] [and then] melting (dravibhuya), and as entered accordingly (yathayatha'!') into those [three syllables] t and that in aU tht octans t. Then, having seen O'!J, etc. melted in sequence (ltramavilinam) [i.e., one into the other, and then back into the liquid], he should empower [it] for as long as he wishes with the three syllables. 211 If the nectar had been prepared for an independent rite of tasting nec-tar, it would now be fed through tubes of light to the ma~<:iala deities, who would \"taste\" it and experience great bliss.o;oo In our text (§36}, however, the nectar becomes the bali offering, and thus the so-called \"tasting of nec-tar\" has served simply to prepare the offering. Bali 0./firing with Mantras §36 The Vajravdrdhi Sddhana now prescribes the method for offering the bali.~~ The first step is to summon the deities to the spot with a hand gesture, simul-taneously uttering a mantra syllable. Some texts add that the yogin has an upward gaze to the left, so that he projects his powerful yogic stare at the deities he wishes to ensnare. -.o] The syllable uttered is phtt (or in other texts. phtfor phf1!1),\\03 while the hand gesture is the flame mudra (jvaidmudrd).~14 Fig. 35· Flamt gtsturt {jvdidmudra). In one Tibetan tradition, the flame mudra is formed by making the trian-gular flame symbol with thumbs and forefingers, and splaying out the other"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"212 VAJRAYOGINI fingers like flames (see fig. 39; also K. Gyatso 1999: 495). At this point, many texts cite a verse that explains that, having made the mudra, the yogin \"should place it at the center of his forehead and move it around several times.\"~~ This is understood to summon the deities. Next, the yogin should generate the imaginary skull bowl that is used to serve nectar to the deities. He docs this in a sequence that mirrors the self-generation of the deity described in the first meditation stage. It begins in the same way, with the preliminary worship and mantric contempla-tion of emptiness. Then comes the sequence of awakenings. The hands are cupped in the gesture of reverence, and these become the sun and moon disks (generated from the vowels and consonants in parallel texts, as in the first awakening). 506 In between them, the seed-syllable hii'!' arises and is visualized transforming into the bowl of nectar. This visualization procedure is still followed even in the Caltrasa,varabalivitihi, which prescribes the usc of actual foodstuffs in a real bowl placed between the hands.w v. 67 Before the nectar is offered to the gods, our text prescribes the utterance of a benedictory verse \"for the sake of obtaining the desired siddhi\" (cf. SUTch. 8, v. 26). The aim of the same verse in SaAvatavajra's Caltra-sa'!'varaba/ivU/hi is more specific in its application and perhaps makes bet-ter sense: it states that the verse is recited for the purpose of\"appropriating\" the bali (p. 57: ba/isviltarartham). In other words, the nectar-which has been prepared inside a different skull bowl according to the tasting of nec-tar-must \"belong\" inside this bowl (a remark that seems to rationalize the appearance of this second offering bowl within the rite). The nectar is then offered to the deities of the m~Qala in the eight directions, passing the bowl counterclockwise in the cardinal directions-a prescription pecu-liar to the SaJ!lvara tradition (it is absent in bali rituals described in the Vajrava/i from the Samaja and Hevajra systems).* While the offering is made, the yogin must keep the metaphysical basis of emptiness in mind. The ontology of nonduality is reflected by the generation of white \"vajra tongues\" for the deities. §37 Our text next supplies two bali mantras with which to offer the nectar to the deities. Since the CaltrasiUJivarabalivitihi (p. 58) names the deities who are to receive the offering with these mantras, we discover that the first mantra given in the Vajravarahi Stldhana is for the site goddesses. It is recited once only. §38, In the same way, we know that the next mantra is for the ~4ala v. 69 leader plus the goddesses on the petals and in the outer circle (i.e., the"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHi SADHANA 213 thirteenfold mal}4a}a}. This is to be repeated five times and is accompa-nied by a scriptural verse (v. 69} for the purpose of achieving siddhi (in the Gzltrasa,varabalivitlhi, this is visualized with the addition of music and betel). §39 Our author then names the recipients of the final offering as the ten protectors of the directions. The mantra is uttered twice. The recipients of the bali offering vary in other texts. In the Sa,varo-tiayatantra (ch. 8, v. 25), it is given to the deities of the three mal)4aJa cir-cles alone; shorter texts may give a more limited selection (often the goddesses of the thirteenfold m31)4aJa, or the ten protectors), with or with-out verses. In contrast, the bali offerings described by Abhayakaragupta in the Vajravali (f. 123r-v) are for many different categories of being, and include (I) a general bali mantra serving all beings (sarvabhautika). absent in GSSn; (2) bali mantras begging the beings of the thirteenfold m31)4aJa to accept the offering (similar to §38); (3) the longer mantra for the site deities on the three m31)4aJa circles (as given in §37); (4) mantras inserting the individual names of the ten ltrodhas (\"wraths\"; seen. 513}; and (5} the mantra for the protectors (as in §39) \"outside\" the circle of protection. As the protectors are offered the bali, they are imagined granting mag-ical powers (sitldhis) to the yogin (§39). Related texts add that the mantrin also sees the protectors experiencing great bliss.~ This reflects the desider-ative function of the bali ritual. The Samaja-based bali ritual in the Vajrdvali (SP f. 122r.7ff.) states that the method of performing the rite depends upon which class of siddhi is foremost. This will influence the time at which the rite is performed, the direction in which bali is offered, and the color of the bali offering. For example, a black-magic rite (abhicarab) would be performed at midnight to the south, with black balis. s•o A desiderative bali ritual may also be performed on behalf of another person. This is described in the Sa'f'varodayatantra (ch. 8, vv. 19ff.), where the worship of the ID31)4a}a with food offerings, etc., is performed on behalf of a third party (dlinapafi/1), and the: \"teacher's assistant .. (ltarma-vajrin)511 therefore meditatively generates the donor as well as the m31)Qala (v. 23ab: utsatja~J elanapati'!' ma~ltz'!' ca pura/Jsaram). The same is true in the V ajravali accounts, in which the bali mantras from all three systems leave the name of the beneficiary to be supplied (amulta-). The Samaja rit-ual adds that it is the sadhaka' s own name that should be used and not that of the third party for whom the ritual is performed. He should instead be convinced that he \"is\" that third party: 512 \"Even when offering bali on another's behalf, one should just recite 'of me, mine' as appropriate in the"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"214 VAJRAYOGINI mantra exactly as it is. And [the ritual performer] should have the firm conviction of [the other person] as being himself. Through having the atti-tude that 'if he is helped, I am helped,' there is the attainment of benefit. Immediately after that he should make the request for him.\" The main function of the balividhi, however, is propitiatory: It is to calm obstacles and to appease malevolent influences. This is evident in the meaning of the mantras themselves, which focus upon destroying or paci-fying negative forces. In the Vajrtivali account, the individual mantras for the ten ltrodhas actually include the name of the person who requires their cooperation. m This is the function of the bali offering when it is performed as a preliminary rite and when (along with other preparatory procedures) it serves to purify the site and to quell obstacles, particularly those of wild or malevolent spirits that may impede the practice. ~14 The propitiatory agenda explains the emphasis in many bali mantras on the outermost (i.e., \"lesser\") beings of the cosmological mal)9ala. Frequently, it is only the last bali mantra (§39: 01JI kha kha khtihi lthahi ... ) that appears in a text, that is, the mantra designated in our work for the protectors, overlords of the wild cremation grounds. In the Samaja rite, Abhayak.aragupta states that after all the deities have received their bali offerings, the mal)9ala circle is absorbed back into the mantrin, whereas the protectors and krodhas are posted outside the m31)9a}a hut in the ten directions, \"intent on protec-tion and fulfilling desires.\" The fact that the bali rituals in our texts go beyond a merely protective function is perhaps the logical consequence of extending the bali offerings to the complete mal)9ala. The bali becomes another powerful means of worshiping deities within the practice of deity yoga for recognized rewards. Another feature of the Vajrayogini bali ritual is that actual foodstuffs are often superseded by imaginal transgressive offerings, purified and nectarized according to the methods given for the rite of tasting nectar. This is again symptomatic of an upgrading of the bali. as it transforms the ancient food offering into a means of inducing great bliss. The deities so propitiated are understood to be all the more powerful in that they fulfill desires on both the mundane and transcendental levels. These developments are borne out by Abhayakaragupta in a liberationist coda to his account of the bali ritu-als of the Samaja, Hevajra, and Saf!lvara systems. He classifies these meth-ods as generation-method practices, then adds a final bali ritual to be performed according to the superior completion method. The completion-method bali ritual intensifies the \"internalization\" already evident in those of the generation method. The visualized forms of the deities are distilled"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 215 in the crucible of pure awareness, and the bali transformed into an offer-ing of knowledge itself-515 These three bali rituals [of the Samija, Sarpvara, and Hevajra sys-tems] are within the generation method. In the completion method, however, the bali ritual [consists of] an offering of bali that is not distinct from the [unique] Ravor of knowledge. [It is offered] to [the protectors of the directions] starting with Indra together with the [maJ}Qala] deities, beginning with one's own lord of the maJ}Qala, whose forms are wisdom and means [and] who have been drawn [down] merely by focusing the attention on them, with a mind \"not shaken\" from wisdom and means. Riu of Completion The bali offering ends with a rite of completion (also taught at §45, §48, and §49), the purpose of which is to compensate for any omission or addi-tion that the yogin may have accidentally made during its performance. This is an integral part of the ritual system, which is founded on the prem-ise that only the correct performance of a prescribed aa ensures success. Correct performance supersedes all other faaors, such as the intention or mental state of the ritual performer. If this seems to contravene the Bud-dhist canonical definition of action as \"intention\" (Anguttaraniluiya III.+Is), this is somewhat counterbalanced by the emphasis we find in the sadhanas on cultivating and maintaining the correa ontological understanding of aaion, with frequent reminders of its basis in emptiness. Thus, the yogin • s mental attitude is still deemed to be crucial, as he must maintain the cor-rect attitude toward his actions, and the tats supply frequent reminders of their basis in nonduality (e.g., §36 following v. 67: pujyapujtipujalttln abheJnul p*t) and frequent injunctions in the course of the rituals them-selves to recite the emptiness mantras. For the rite of completion, betel and other foodstuffs are first offered to the assembled deities all together. Secret hand signals (choma) are per-formed, and the bell is rung. The hundred-syllabled mantra is then recited, followed by the recitation of an emptiness mantra, and the deities are simul-taneously gratified with the gesture of \"turning the lotus\" (luzmlllllvarta-muJrti). For this gesture, the sidhaka holds a vajra and vajra bell in his outstretched fingers and revolves them with a fluttering motion-a \"dance\""},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"216 VAJRAYOGINi that resembles \"a blossoming lotus stirred by the wind.\" (fhe bell is another symbol of the feminine aspect or consort, and as such is often visualized along with the vajra, representing the male aspect.)5'6 The deities are then dismissed as the yogin moves his arms into the crossed gesture of embrace, snaps his fingers (or touches the ground),m and then withdraws the mudra, while reciting the syllables of dismissal. Finally, the practitioner absorbs the mat:tcJala into himself. External Worship §~1 The Vajravarahi SaJhana now moves on to the external rites of worship (bahyapujti), the essential features of which are (1) the generation of the goddess in a locus external to the yogin's own body, (2) her worship in that locus, and (3) a rite of completion. Our author describes two rituals of worship. The following paragraphs (§41-§45) give detailed prescriptions for the first, and this is followed below (at §49) with a second, briefer account, involving the imaginal feasting of deities with food offerings. Both optionally involve the \"hand worship\" (§46). {The parallel tats for these portions are cited in full in the Textual Notes to §.p-§52.) Like the sadhana meditation, these rites were probably intended to be performed three or four times a day. Indeed, the self-generation is the nec-essary preliminary to their performance, as they are to be undertaken by the yogin in union with the goddess (GSSs Sed p. 145, K31n: INljraVIliro-caniyogavan mantn). However, the practitioner of deity yoga may also undertake the rites independently from the self-generation meditation, as the passage (§41) begins with prescriptions to rise early and to purify the place. With the appropriate mantras, the yogin also visualizes a circle of pro-tection that imaginally constitutes the ground in front of the yogin as the \"vajra ground.\" Next, a tnaQC;iala diagram is drawn onto the vajra ground. Here, the text prescribes a triangle containing a circle, which represents the lotus within the dharmodayti, the origin of existents (as in the self-generation of the sadhana). In the alternative external worship (§~9), the yogin draws only the simple (inverted) triangle of the dharmotl4ya (and the shape of the diagram does vary in other texts).511 The diagram is drawn using a paste made of esoteric substances, or failing those, of cow dung (and, in the second rite, of wine §49). The nectars arc described as a \"pill\" (gulilta; here va,tilta or gw!iltli) made of the five nectars, and sometimes called the samaya pill. m Elsewhere prescriptions require the yogin to draw"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHi SADHANA 2.17 the diagram .. using saffron, bright yellow orpiment, and vermilion powder, or with [just] one of them.\" Other esoteric substances may also be used, such as the first menstrual blood of a young girl, a highly valued substance in pan-Indian ltlltta traditions, or a mixture of blood and onion.~20 The yogin draws the diagram by tracing it with the liquid or paste onto the ground with the fourth finger of his left hand (§49). According to other accounts he does this with an implement such as a golden stylus (GSS35), or a brush made of the hair of thieves executed in the cremation ground. m Within the drawn JharmoJtzya, the yogin then generates the pledge form ofVajravarahi from her seed-syllable, va,, which has issued from his heart, and the knowledge form is drawn into the pledge form with rays in the usual way. Our author adheres to his sequential approach, prescribing only the generation of the central deity, Vajravarahi, at this stage. The method of doing the practice with the fuller maJ]cJala may be inferred (§45) from the meditation stages taught above. In contrast, the Abhisamayamalijari is faithful to its method of self-generating the maJ]4a}a in its entirety upon the elements and Mount Meru. §42 The stage is now set for the worship itself, which constitutes a number of different ceremonies. It begins with traditional offerings visualized bil-lowing from the sadhaka's heart. Next he makes an actual external offer-ing from his left hand of a flower, which has been ritually purified for the purpose (perhaps with mantras, or with a rite similar to that supplied for the mantra bath). Next the usual mantras for the central goddess are uttered along with the eight-part mantra \"for praise\" (given earlier, §32}, and this section of the worship closes with a final offering mantra to the eight pro-tectors (as in the bali ritual), this time with their names included in the mantras. S-43 Next, the yogin offers a flower to the deities that he has visualized \"on his hand.\" This is a slighdy ambiguous reference to the hand worship (full details for which are only given by the author below, §46) but one con-firmed by the: parallel texts (sc:c: Textual Notes). The hand worship also appears in two Nepalese Sanskrit ritual texts of the yoginitantra tradition; they confirm its usage in this context. m In these works, the opening sequence (termed aJiyoga) is similar to the Vajravartihi StiJhana in that it includes: preparations, the generation of the maJ]Qala and its infusion with the knowledge deities (as at §4J), the offering of a flower to each deity of the maJ]4a}a with the appropriate mantra followed by the eight-part mantra (as at §42), and finally the hand worship (apparendy here at §43). m The practice as described in the Vajravlirlihi Stidhana (§43) ends with the"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"218 VAJRAYOGINI absorption of the deities on the yogin's left hand into himself, which again points to the the hand worship. §44-§-45 The following paragraph continues the worship of the mai)Q.ala with mantras and verses of praise and concludes with the bodhisattva prepara-tions. This again mirrors the iidiyoga in the Nepalese ritual texts, which end with the supreme worship (it perhaps also overlaps with their ma~iyoga portion, which begins with the brahmavihtiras and meditations on empti-ness). A rite of completion (§45) marks the end of the external worship. Worship on the Hand (hastapiija) §-46 The hand worship is to be inserted into a rite of external worship in the manner just described (§43). Our sources (parallel text is cited in the Tex-tual Notes) all state that the hand worship is derived from the Yogini-sa1Jlctiratantra (§48), although this scripture sheds no further light on the practice. 'H The hand worship begins (§46) by stating that the mantrin is \"in union with his own chosen deity\" (sve!fadevattiyultto mantri), that is, self-generated as Vajravarahi. He visualizes her within the festive \"circle of the assembly and so on •• (ga!Jama!Jtjaltidau). The gathering of an actual ga!J4ma'}l}ala or ga!'flcakra included a tantric feast at which alcoholic sub-stances such as soma were drunk, delectable foods eaten, and sexual yogic rites with consorts performed. The orgiastic nature of the rites is explic-itly described in the Kriytisamuccaya. for example in its Niiacakra, which recommends eight types of taboo consort-all female relatives. Indeed, according to its Ga!'fl'akravidhi, \"that sacramental circle (ga!Jacaltra) that is without [sex with] a female partner (prajfui) is a [mere] meeting of rice scum\" (cited Gellner 1992: 297).m In the Vajravtirtihi Stidhana. however, the feast is performed imaginally, and the tantric assembly comprises a mal)4ala of armor gods and armor goddesses. There is also the alternative of visualizing the goddesses of the three mai)Q.ala circles (whose associa-tion with the sites as meeting places for sexual yogic practices has already been discussed. In the first stages of the rite, six syllables are placed on the fingers on the palm side of the left hand. These are the syllables of the armor gods in the CakrasaJ!lvara tradition and are represented by the six buddhas (variants to the syllables are shown in the footnotes to the translation).~16 The San-skrit text states that the syllables are placed on the fingers and thumb of"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 219 the left hand, plus their \"nails. \"m Sanderson (1999: personal communica-tion) notes that in Saiva prototypes, the thumb's mantra is installed with the index finger and the mantras of the fingers with the thumb. For the nails, one would presumably curl the fingers and run the thumb over the nails, so that the sixth buddha (the mantra syllables phat ha'!') is placed on them collectively-much as the sixth leavaca deity is for the \"whole body\" in the armoring. Then, in the palm of the hand itself, the yogin sees a lotus with O'!' Vll1fl on its pericarp, the essentialized form ofVajnlVarahi as armor goddess. Sur-rounding her on a five-petaled lotus (paiiclllialaleamalllm) are the syllables of the five remaining armor goddesses in sequence. On the back of the hand is seen the mirror image of the syllables. As an alternative, the back of the hand may be visualized with the three maJ].Qala circles (probably indicating the visualization of the syllables of the sites, pu'!'-etc., as at §30). Table 25.

This involves daubing points of his body as he utters the three syllables in their inverted sequence: hu'!' (heart), til; (throat), O'!'

It is conducted along similar lines to the first rite but involves a few variations. Here the yogin is to imagine feasting the single goddess Vajravarahi with food offerings, but in a different external locus. He visu-alizes her within a triangle drawn upon the ground, dwelling in the eight cremation grounds. The offerings of food are visualized as the production of the nectars and so on, and the beings of the cremation grounds are again to be gratified with a final mantra offering in the manner of a final bali rit-ual.

In our text, however, the oblation ritual takes the form of a visu-alization performed internally, within the yogin. For an external oblation ritual within the Vajrayogini tradition, we can tum to the PraJipahutivitJhi (GSS1-4).m This text describes how the mantrin in union with his deity cre-ates a fire pit (v. s), within which he lights a fire, both by kindling wood (v. 7a) and through mentally drawing down the \"supreme fire of knowl-edge {jfuiNigni-) of the conquerors\" with the seed-syllable in his own heart (v. 6ab). He then visualizes the fire deity in the heart of the fire (the only solitary male deity mentioned in the GSS) and his own deity {Vajrayogini) seated in its heart. He worships Vajrayogini by making oblations into the fire consisting of the five nectars and of scented woods. The Vajravtirtihi Stitlhana adapts and internalizes this kind of external oblation to suit the context of meditative yogic performance. Thus we find that the fire pit is understood to be the yogin's own navel, and offerings are made to the god-dess who is visualized within it engulfed in the \"fire of wisdom. \"m The process of internalizing the oblation ritual can also be observed in two other Vajrayogini texts. In an internal oblation described in the Sa'!'-pufOI/bhavatllntra (vv. 18-22ab), the \"blazing fire of wisdom\" is located within the meditator's genitals (while the V asantllti/4/ui adds that the wind that fans the fire is within his feet):m (18) The oblation (homa/.J) should be made into the greatly blaz-ing fire of wisdom, with the offering (havis) that inwardly is semen [in the central channel, avatihiiti,] and [blood in the right channel, rasallli, and urine in the left channel, la/4Ni], and out-wardly is [the skandhas] beginning with form.

(22ab) The fire is in the loins (trilta.ti-), fanned up by the winds of karma [which are in the feet].u~ As this passage shows, the oblations that are to be made into the wisdom fire are said to have an \"outer\" and \"inner\" value. The \"outward\" level is that of a body maJ]Qala, in which the psychophysical body of the yogin is identified with the maJ]Qala of goddesses. In this oblation, the offering consists of the skandhas, which are burnt up as \"fuel, \"H6 while the offer-ings into the fire are not to the goddess Vajravarahi but to the buddhas and mothers (Qakinis) who are equated with the psychophysical organism. The \"inward\" level is that ofinternal yogic practice, in which the oblation offer-ings are understood to be the contents of the three central veins or chan-nels (semen, blood, and urine), which will all be drawn into the central channel in the course of being offered into the fire. In these internal oblation texts, the traditional ritual tools of an external oblation rite are also represented. For example, traditional oblation requires a ladle (sruva[J) held in the right hand, and the vessel holding the oblation of ghee ({gh,rta]pdtri) held in the left hand (there is also a larger ladle, the srult, sometimes used instead of the sruval;).w In the internal oblation, the ladle and the vessel are understood to be the two lateral channels. Rmand on the right is the ladle, and lalana on the left is the oblation vessel (SpliT v. 19d: havirbhtijanam; referred to in GSSn simply as the \"oblation\": lihuti/,1). This scriptural passage also seems to identify the ritual parapher-nalia with yogic caltras, as the heart caltra is said to be /a/ana (v. 2ob). §p. The ritual prescriptions of the Vajravlirdhi SaJhana close (§52) with a rite that is concerned with an offering of bali made up of actual foodstuffs. (This is probably because the source text continued with a series of exter-nal oblation rituals, as shown in the parallel texts and Textual Notes.)~18 The bali is offered to the eponymous deicy of leftovers, Ucchi~!avajra (as the imperative of the mantra reveals). With the offering of the leftover bali, the yogin induces him to preside. This rite appears also in the Sa,varotitzya-tantra (ch. 8, v. 38), in which the remnants of the oblation are offered to the spirits (bhutas) as well as to the god, \"Ucchu~ma.\""},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"STUDY OF THE VAJRAVARAHI SADHANA 223 Concluding V mes vv.

No. 1455 (Winter-nitz and Keith 1905). Palm-leaf, cataloged as probably founcenth century, although it may date from as early as the twelfth or thirteenth centuries (Sanderson 1995: personal communication). The last folio is numbered f. 147. The script is ltufi/4-nmJtiri.' K is the oldest and most reliable witness for the collection of sadhanas, written in a clear, bold hand. Due to the derivative nature of the later manuscripts, citations from the GSS in the footnotes to the Edition are from manuscript K only, unless other manu-scripts contribute to the sense (significant variants alone arc recorded). Each sadhana in K has a shon colophon, but K does not provide an over-all tide to the collection as a whole. The last work in the series is the /)tiltiniguhyasamayastidhanJt (GSS46), which seems to have given its title to the collection as a whole in a later manuscript (D). The Bodleian catalog calls the collection the SaJhanJtmala Tantra. The sadhanas themselves arc not numbered (the scribe leaves a small gap between them), and the num-bering of the GSS collection (GSS1-GSS46) is thus entirely editorial. There arc fifteen missing folios (ff. 9~100, and ff. 29-38 inclusive). Four highly damaged folios in a second hand have been placed at the bottom of the pile of leaves, and these may contain some of the missing passages of text. Most palm leaves have been reduced around the edges, and some are a little split, although this rarely impedes legibility. Most folios have cor-rections written in by either the first or a second hand, some with evidence of several hands, such as the addition of the mantra syllables to be extracted with a mantrotltJhtira (e.g., f. 52r-v, GSS1o).

Tibetan script is found in some of the margins, often bearing the colophon to a sadhana. 2 The foliation is problematic. I found the folios of the manuscript out of sequence, a confusion that has been transferred to the photographs of the Bodleian microfilm (Reel No. SF. Or. 2584). I have now corrected the sequence of the folios and have the following observations to make on the foliation (and misfoliation) of the collection: 1) The original foliation probably occurred after the text was first copied, because some folio numbers are not in text sequence, and because the hand of the first foliator may be different from that of the main scribe. 2) At some stage, the sequence of the leaves was disordered, and the orig-inal foliation was tampered with by a second foliator without reference to the sequence of the Sanskrit text. This gave rise to the following problems: • There is a folio without a number containing the middle ponion of GSS2. I have numbered this folio \"o\" (o.r. and o.v.). • The colophon Vajravtirtlhisddhanam appears twice in the collection (GSS2 and GSSn). The two leaves containing the folios were placed together, the second colophon (for GSSu on f. 70) being placed before the first (for GSS2 on f. u).

This epic-type frame story is not found in sadhana literature, and a \"conversion\" would be antithetical to the esoteric, initiation-based systems fundamental to tantric sadhanas. However, there is some doubt as to whether Umapatideva was himself an ordained monk, and it is just possible that the naming of a lay personage may have some significance.

The corruption !a!' mudrab (for !a!' mantrab) appears again in K when supplying mantras (below, §7), although N and D there have the variant mantra-. Other texts refer to six \"mantras,, e.g., GSS3 (KI3r3): !atfokvatiiuddhair mantrapaJair bhagavati'!' kavacay~t. but the mantra syl-lables may have been accompanied by hand gestures (mudraJ;), and it is just possible that the reading o mudral; in the mss. is correct. In a corrupt pas-sage, the YSCf uses both mudra and mantra to describe the armoring in pafala 7 (A4r.7, Bsv): tatab kavacadvayam iilmlina1f1 jfiiinacaltra1fl vibhavita,. samayacakr~ pravisy(asysa?) mudramantrn,uz yoginti. Some sadhanas supply the syllables and describe their accompanying mudras, e.g., SMI (p. 5); SM28 (pp. 68-69): tata/1 paficangavinyasa, mudrabhir mantrasa,hatabhib kuryat; etc. §7 jfuinasattvapravei~ tu: §7 is omitted in the Tibetan text. v.27i tatraya'!' ukamantrab -.v. 27i, §8: Omitted in the Tibetan text. v.27i \"o'!' sarvatathagatiibhi!~kasamayairiyt hu'!' .. iti: There seem to be two traditions in the formulation of the mantra.

Sanderson (1998: personal communication) has noted that tira/U may be derived from Tamil and Malayalam ara/i meaning \"oleander\" (Burrow and Emeneau 1961. A Draviliian Etymological Dictionary. Oxford: entry 173), but that there are also other Dravidian possibilities, namely, Tamil araf \"to be terrified\" (ibid. s.v. entry 2980), and acal, \"to burn,\" \"to become angry\" I acali. \"fire\" (ibid. s.v. entry 234.); tircal\"power,\" \"wisdom\" (ibid s.v. entry 239). The word appears in compound in GSSt-GSS2, cited in full in chapter 2 (p. 53) (IU8ov/ov): trilto1Jilma'.'f!4ia'!' ramya'!' vajrtirallivinibsrtam. Here it may be equivalent to padma, and hence the term would mean: \"produced from [the union of] vajra (penis) and padma (vagina).\" Isaacson (1996) has shown other instances of the term, including a possibly similar usage in Mahasukhavajrapada's commentary to the Car.u:/dmahtiro!Jl1Jiltllntra, in which the lord of the maJ}4aia is said to have \"arisen from the vajrtiraOi\" (ms. NAK 3-402 NGMPP B 31/7 f. 6v2). Here its function seems to be that of the Jharmot./4yti, as in the Sa'!'putatantra ch. 1 (p. 238): ~lttira/t.rti~ riiSIISJiliva'!' yathti bhavati I trilto!'~ ma!'f!ak ramy~ vajrtiralivinism.rta'!'

There is a group of Vajrtirallitllntras in the tantric canon (e.g., the ~gi-tirallz), now known only through quotations in surviving literature (Isaacson 1997: per-sonal communication; cf. Bendallt885: 171). The .. .A ra li .. tantras appear in Bu ston's analysis of the Tibetan canon within the Y~ shts rgyuJ (wisdom tllntras) within the Saipvara (bD~ mchog) groupings, that also contain the Laghusa,VIlra and the Sa'!'varodttyatllntra (sec Tsuda 1974: 28 and Dawa-Samdup 1919: 7-8). -§41 GSSs (Sed p. 1451~, K31n): bahyapujaviJhir ucyat~. iha bhagavati1JI pujayitultti1fllli.J prtitar utthaya yathtivasllrll'!' vti vajrllvairocaniyogavtin mantri luciprtZJd~ hasfll'!'

Sanderson adds, \"These vowels (a. i, u, e. i, with the syl-lable llf!l) are known in the Saiva technical terminology of mantrailistra as the \"five shorts\" (hrasva-).

For the western cremation grounds, texts give Vajrajvalakula-karankaka, Jvalakulakar.uikaka, Karailkaka, and Jvalakula. For the south-em cremation grounds, they may give Subhi~a or Vibhi~a, or omit Subhi~a/Vibhi~a altogether and split the compound for the western cremation grounds, to give Karankaka (west) and Jvalakula (south). More textual research is needed to solve the problem, which may have arisen because both jvtiltiltula and subh;,a~vibhifa!Ul arc possible qualifications of the proper nouns that designate the cremation grounds. From the sources examined so far, the names Jvalakulakarankaka (west) and Vibhipt)a (south) are the most common (perhaps corroborated by the inclusion in this western cremation ground of the aloluJ/Itan/t~/j tree, whose flaming red flowers also suggest a motifofftame), e.g., SUTch. 17, v. 36cd: ca!'f!,ogra'!' gahvarfll!l CJZiva vajrajvti/iiltaranltillllm, which suggests Vajrajvala west and Karailkin south, although the text should read a dual ( ... vajrajvaltlltaranltini).

GSSI Vajrayoginimukhagama (Oral Transmission ofVajrayogini) by Indrabhuti 1 The sadhana begins with a bcnedictory Jloka and proceeds with the prepa-rations upon rising, including a mantra bath (mantramlinam). The empti-ness mantras follow, and the sudden self-generation of ardhaparyanka-pose Vajravarahi at the navel. Her mantra is visualized whirling and blazing in her sex and is supplied in a mantra extraction (mantrotitiharab). This is fol-lowed by an external worship (parvapuja) and ten traditional frame verses on the topics of secrecy, transgressive discipline, Yogacira metaphysics, the success of the practice, and the guru. The bulk of this text (up to and includ-ing the mantra extraction, but excepting the concluding worship and frame-verses) is the same as the V~tjrllvarahisaJhana (GSS2.) by Liiyipada.

The sadhana ends with the promise of siddhi, and external food offerings as the bali. GSS3 Vajravarahisadhana by AdvayaVIljra' The work begins with the standard preliminaries and bodhisattva prepa-rations. Following the emptiness mantras, the cosmos is visualized with Meru and the temple palace, and the circle of protection is installed. The self-generation through the sequence of awakenings is of a two-armed, pratytl/it!ha-stance Vajravarahi within the fivefold maJ}Qala.

The Samath edition is based on four Sanskrit manuscripts, as follows: • the Gubytu4~NI­SII'flfPJ\"' (Microfilm Catalog of the Buddhist Mss. Nepal 1981. p.no); \\4f the 1)4/tiniguhyauzmytiSiitJhiiNtmtillilllntrllTiijll (a photocopy of a OWluscript related to our ms. D): 1T the Guhyas4\"\"'J'JS\"1!'1IIhll (our ms.

There arc OWlY por-tions of text in GSSs that are found in similar or identical form in other sadhanas of the GSS and SM, listed as appropriate elsewhere in this book. 6 Mss. K, N, and D all refer to the author as Sikyaralqita (K39n). The same colophon appears in the Nepali paper ms. (Sed ms. \"if) but reading \"Santaralqita, .. while the colophon to Sed (p. 154) reads ·Subhikaragupta,'\" although the source of this reading is unclear. According to BBK (p. 279), different mss. of the TllltlllljlitiNISII'fiSUIJhi attribute the work to Santaralqita and Subhikaragupta. The antiquity of the GSS manuscript K supports the authorship of ~ta. Moreover, S~ita states that his guru was Abhayikaragupta (see ch.

The sequence of the prescriptions in the text is as follows: preliminaries (-GSS3/GSS31) ending with a bodhi-sattVa vow, armoring, circle of protection, temple palace (mllhavim4n4) surrounded by cremation grounds (with a short description of the crema-tion grounds drawing on SUT), visualization of the thirteen-syllabled mantra as the thirteenfold maJ]4ala, the generation through awakenings of Vajravarahi in iconographic form surrounded by Vajra4akini goddesses produced from syllables, the worship of the goddesses with imaginary offer-ings, entry of knowledge deities, arrnoring, praise, and bodhisattVa vow, sevenfold worship with the recitation of flower-offering mantras followed by another bodhisattVa vow, emptiness mantras with nonabiding, the rep-etition of the installation of the circle of protection and the subsequent visualization ofVajravarahi produced suddenly with the maJ]4aia retinue placed on points on the body, worship, the tasting of nectar, external bali offerings, another bodhisattva vow, concluding verses possibly by Advayavajra, and dedication of merit. This sadhana combines several important themes. In its preparatory stages, it describes the cremation grounds in detail, as well as prescribing the visualization of a palace (vim4Ntl;lm). The erotic overtones of the sadhana may be associated with the f2ct that the sadhana was supposedly taught by the Buddha in the location of Mount Manobhailga and the pavil-ion, Cittavisrama, a place associated with erotic manifestations of Vajra-yogini. The structure of the sadhana is also unusual. The maJ]4aia is first produced through an externalization of the thirteen syllables of the deity's mantra. This is then intensified by its transformation from mantric to iconographic form. The emanation of the iconographic maJ]4aJa is then repeated in a completion-stage practice, by self-generating it .. all at once\" (jhafiti). thus indicating the sadhaka' s complete integration of the external forms within himself. Finally, the mantra syllables of which the 4akini god-desses are representations are placed upon his body in a short body maJ]4ala, thus internalizing the maJ]4aia back into the body of the yogin. Every step in this process includes an arrnoring, and the sadhana therefore includes far more armor sections than is normal.

This is followed by a brief bali mantra and two intro-ductory praise verses. The sixteen (unnumbered) verses of the stotra praise different aspects of Vajrayogini's inner and outer nature, especially her universal aspect as a manifestation of all other goddesses. The stotra ends with a praise section of six verses (K94r3-6). (from a manuscript belonging to]. Locke) is identifiably our GSS25. According to Nihom' s edition, Locke's manuscript differs in a few minor points. For exam-ple, there are a handful of variants and scribal errors, the omission of mantra units hiirrz and phaf on a couple of occasions, and some differences in the final dedicatory verse. One significant difference is the addition in Locke's ms. ofheart and auxiliary-heart mantras.

This is a rather unwelcome addition. No other sadhanas in this set mention these mantras, and the auxiliary-heart mantra is, in any case, incomplete. It is followed by the phrase used in GSS5 to explain the formulation of the mantras with the sites and to finish the visualization (see ch. 2). I suggest that Locke's manuscript has become contaminated at this point. Some emenda-tions/corrections to Nihom's edition are desirable in the light of our texts.

Both deities are visualized as drops (bindus) within the sadhaka's body, which is visu-alized as a skeleton-arch {karmikatoraram) located in the midst of the cre-mation grounds. The meditations espoused are often obscure, based on the visualization of the deities-as-drops produced from the syllables of the salutation {namap frivajrayogini): their fusion in yogic meditations is pro-ductive of great bliss. The visualization of iconic forms are sited on/in the sexual organs and often involve deities not mentioned elsewhere in the Vajrayogini corpus. The vocabulary of the sadhanas shows the influence of Hevajratantra systems in some of its citations and terminology, e.g., bola=vajra (penis); kakkola=padma (vagina), cf. HT2.3.53ff.

The development of the svddhif!hdna wing of the kdpdlika movement requires further research. Isaacson (in his unpublished annotations to the Hevajrasekaprakriyd 1996) explores its textual prove-nance. He refers to the Paficakrama (chapter 3 of Svddhif!hdnakrama), which provides the backdrop to the yoginitantra practices and to yogini-tantra exegetes, such as Advayavajra (e.g., in the Advayavajrasa'f!lgraha: Paficatathdgatamudrdvivararza, Caturmudrdnifcaya, and Amanasikdrd-dhdra), L~minkara (in Advayasiddhi in Guhyadyt¥fasiddhisa'f!lgraha Rare Buddhist Texts no. 1, Sarnath, 1987 pp. 162-63), Abhayakaragupta (in Buddhakapdlatantra), and Padmavajra (in Guhyasiddhi/;4.61). Typical ref-erences to svddhif!hdna refer to its completion methodology, its incon-ceivability, and its rejection of ritual, including dik!d, homa, mantras, and special days for observance.41 Isaacson (1998: personal communication) has also pointed to the connection between svddhif!/;dna practices and the late tantric methodology of the Vasantatilakd, which also deals with internal-ized yogic practice (Vasanta/ Heruka as a drop in the heart merges with Tilaka/Varahi, a drop in the navel or sex, nirmdrzacakra), but whereas the Vasantatilaka practices are internal and relate mainly to the movement of drops between the heart and navel, the emphasis in the GSS texts is upon the locus of the sex organs and the generation of sexual passion, either in practice with a consort or imaginally.42 41 See SUT ch. 21, vv. 6ff.; Paiicakrama (ch. 3, v. 45): sarvapii}ii'f!l parityajya guru-pujiirrz samiirabhet I tena tuf!erza tallabhya'f!l sarvajiiajiiiiiiam uttamam (also cited SUT ch. 33, v. 27); YSCT (ch. 12, v. 1): na raktarziyarrz na bhaktarziya'f!l na marzrfaleyarrz, na ca marzrfalarrz ca I na mantrajiipo na tapo na homa!J samiisataf cittasamiijariipi; ch. 15 (A?V): niikiiryam vidyate kirrzcitl niicintyarrz vidyate sadii I niibhaktarrz vidyate ki'f!lcit niiviicyarrz yac chubhiifubha'f!l I. . . iti sa'f!lcintya yogiitmii sarvamudriimantravarjitarrz si'f!lhavad vicaret vira!J sarviifiiparipiiraka!J; Aryadeva' s Sviidhif!hiinaprabheda (Dhi!J val. 10, pp. 2o-24, v. 7): niitra fauca'f!l na niyamo na tapo na ca dutkaram I adutkarair aniyamai!J sukhair hartaif ca sidhyati.

The sadhana describes the visualization of the syllables of the obeisance na-ma-fri and the production from those of the skeleton arch and deities. First is visualized the skeleton arch (from NZ-) surrounded by fearsome ere-marion grounds, the corpse throne with sun disc (from ma-), and the god-dess Vyadhamayogini (from fri-). Next comes the teaching on the five syllables (pancli/qaranirtkia/1) va-jra-yo-gi-ni, which produces the armor goddesses (KI12v4). 2. The twenty-four sites are then equated with the skeleton arch visual-ized in the nirmii!'4lorus, i.e., the vagina (KI13r3). These are internalized (lit: suppressed, niroJha/1). 3· The cremation grounds are also internalized and equated with the psychophysical organism in a kind of yogic body maQQala (Kli3rS-II4f3). 4· A yogic meditation induces a deep meditative state (ascribed to a teXt called the Sahajanirtkia, I<I14V2). 5· There is an installation (of syllables?) onto the limbs of four goddesses equated with the four types of conson (mwlrti) (karma-, dharma-, samaya-, and mahamudra, I<II4vs). The meditations and quotes that follow expand upon the four mudras, e.g., the Caturmudranvaya is cited regarding the qualities of the ltarmamuJrli (KI15r4). 6. A six-spoked CakrasatpvaraNajravarahi maQQala is visualized on the erect penis and another within the vagina. The central figure is the lord under the arch; there follow yogic meditations of union. 7· Meditations by Liiyipada (KIIsr6) equate the cremation ground with the eight vijna1UIS; the skeleton arch is visualized in their midst with the fusion of two bijas in its center productive of \"great lust and passion\" (mahtirliglinurliga-). There is a reflection on the bintlu upon the syllable hu'!' and the union of two bintlus. 8. An explanation follows of the samayamuJra in which samaya is defined as twofold, raft,a1J4m, and bhak,aiJilm (Ku6n; see ch. 3), and each is fur-ther defined as tenfold. Yogic meditations on the nliJa are prescribed, pro-ducing the nondual awareness called samayamutirli. 9· The yogin is to meditate on mahamudra according to the teaching of Liiyipada (I<Ir6v4), with the contemplation of the skeleton as compassion and the arch as emptiness, and mahamudra within that. The siddhi of mahamudra is attained through yogic meditations.

Following his enjoy-ment of the five nectars and contemplation of the brahmavihdras, he sud-denly takes on the aharpkdra of the deity. The vajra ground is installed, followed by emptiness meditations and the visualization of the cosmos with Mount Sumeru. A four-armed Vajrayogini is generated internally. The knowledge deities are summoned and worshiped with the supreme worship and the tasting of nectar (KI19r2), which is followed by a yogic-type armoring (of the six cakras and nine orifices with hiirrz, KI19v4) and a yogic meditation in which mantras are visualized flowing through the body, culminating in the non perception of dharmas. In an external rite, the form of the goddess is self-generated suddenly and empowered with an armoring (as before, KII9v3). The ground is prepared with transgressive substances, a mal).<;fala is drawn, and offerings made. In this rite, the letters of the mantra are drawn counterclockwise on the surface of a mirror with vermilion powder, and the knowledge form is drawn into it. There follow rites performed with the left hand (KII9v6-nor), namely, the hand wor-ship, tasting of nectar, and bali offerings, followed by praise, the bodhisattva vow, and a dedication of merit. Two short rites describe the means of accepting a pupil (KI2or2) and of creating an amulet (KI2or6-v). GSS36 Kiirmapatanakrametza Vajrayoginisddhana48 (Sadhana of Vajrayogini with the Method of the Falling Turtle) This form ofVajrayogini is generated in front of the sadhaka inside a dou-ble dharmodayd with the aid of an image of the goddess. She is produced through a sequence of awakenings and stands in the \"falling-turtle\" stance. It concludes with a bali ritual. 47 Witnesses: Kn8r2-120v3, N83r4-85f4, D86r4-88r4.

After practice on ten parvan days, a vision of Vajrayogini is promised, to be preceded by omens. Rites of appeasement, etc., are then to be performed. The text is corrupt where it prescribes the pose (f pratydlitfoastha'!' iirtihvapdt/tl'!' ca f).~ Although there is no trace of a dual in the text, it may have intended these poses to refer to two attendant god-desses who would be placed one on each side of the central goddess. It is noteworthy in this respect that Vajrayogini wears the six mudras of a maQ9ala leader. Another threefold mat)4ala is also described in other texts associated with Viriipa, cf. the T rikayavajrayogini group. Possibly indica-tive of corruption is the unnecessary repetition of the goddess as two armed (dvibhu}d'!') just before the poses are given. The white form ofVajrayogini described in GSS37 appears in the GSS collection beside the white warrior-stance Vajravarahi (GSS38) shown to be related to white Vajragho1_1a-Vajravarahi. The rwo manifestations share some details, such as the goddess's generation from a white syllable hri'!' (GSS37) or hrib (GSS38). However, the white Vajrayogini in GSS37 has most in common with the red warrior-stance Vajrayogini, as described in GSS19. The ritual ponions are similar in that both prescribe worship of the goddess on an auspicious night. GSS37 adds that the goal is siddhi (KI22n: vajrayoginisiddhyartha'!') and mentions various omens and a vision of the goddess as a prerequisite for peaceful rites.

This was particularly kind given his reservations about bringing esoteric tantric material into the public domain. He points out that sources dealing with the topic are almost exclusively in Tibetan.

The initia-tions and sadhanas themselves have been published in recent years amongst Sa skya pas in India, in a six-volume collection of teachings on Vajrayogini, enti-ded the dPal /J4n S4 sltya JNII lugs nliro mltha' spyod mal sltor.

Maitri Khecari entered the Sa skya tradition with Sa chen Kun dga' snying po's son, rJe bnun Grags pa rgyal mtshan (1147-1216). According to the material on Maitri Khecari (in dPal /Jan Sll s/ry4 JNZ'i lugs nl1ro mltha' spyoJ mal sltorvol. 6, p. 203), he received it from one Dar rna Yon ten, a disciple of Sum paLo tsa wa. One Tibetan publication (with the English tide A History of rlH Sa-sltya-pa S«t ofTibdlln BuJJhism, by T. G.

Indeed, Ngawang Dhargycy (1992: 19) notes that in imparting the Sa skya lin-eage teachings, his own teacher, Kyabje Trijang Dorjechang. was often speak-ing from his own experience rather than relying on tatual transmissions or commentaries. To what extent these works can help throw light on the Indian textual tradition studied here is very doubtful. Where I provide citations from these works, I do so with caution. This caution is all the more necessary because the teachers have tended to compose and edit their works from transcriptions of their oral commentaries (Tharchin 1997: Acknowledgments; K. Gyatso 1997: ix)-transcriptions made by pupils who themselves may have relied upon a translator. Apart from the difficulty in locating the sources used by the teach-ers, it is not always evident how a given translation rdatcs to its explanation, as Dr. Sobisch has pointed out, e.g., Tharchin 1997: 192. 15 The appearance ofVajravarahi within rNying rna theology, hagiography, and myth is wdl attested, as in the definitive volumes by Dudjom Rinpoche (1991), as well as in many other published works, e.g., Germano and Gyatso (2000:"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES xxvi-2 246ff.). Ye shes mtsho rgyal's lifestory (Bod kyi jo mo ye shes mtsho rgyal gyi mdzad tshul rnam par thar pa gab pa mngon byung rgyud mangs dri za 'i glu 'phreng) has been translated by Tulku (1983), Dowman (1984), and Changchub and Nyingpo (1999). References to Ye shes mtsho rgyal as the principal custo-dian and transmitter of\"treasure\" texts (gter-ma) abound, e.g., Dancing Moon in Waterr4 Q. Gyatso 1998: 31-2), Dudjom (1991: 581, 586-87), Dowman (1984: 73, 121-41), Germano and Gyatso (2000: 244, 248). 16 Literature on the meditative practice ofYe shes mtsho rgyal/Vajraviirahi/Vajra-yogini is plentiful, e.g., Klein (1995: 139, 144, 147), Patrul (1994: 313), Khyentse (1988), Thondup (1983, 1992).

This is the sngon 'gro of the extremely popular treasure cycle dKon mchog spyi 'dusderived from the treasure revealer, Rig 'dzin 'Ja 'tshon snying po (1585-1656). LamaJampa Thaye (to whom I owe this information) points out that the chief deity of the cycle is in fact the <;lakini Sif!1hamukha (sic), who is the focus of the yang gsang(\"utterly secret\") part of the generation-stage practices. He writes, \"The employment ofVajrayogini in the sngon 'gro may reflect the influence of the bKa' brgyud tradition among the rNying rna. 'Ja 'tshon sNying po, prior to his activity as a treasure-revealer, was a 'Brugs pa bKa' brgyud monk and the sngon 'gro itself was formulated later by 'Jam mgon Kong sprul, who was of course a Karma bKa' brgyud pa.\" I also thank Rig-dzin Shikpo for sending me his outline and explanation of the Thar pa 'i bde lam. 17 The full name of the Tibetan text is rDzogs pa chen po sku gsum rang shar las thun mong gtum mo 'i nyams len ye shes me dpung bzhugs so, which the author translates into pidgin Sanskrit as Kayasahdsarva1J'l trisvaya1J2biirpasya sdmanya-ca!ltfiiuKJJibhya jfzajvala tisma. I thank Dr. Peter Alan Roberts for this infor-mation and for providing me with a copy of his unpublished translation. 18 Simmer-Brown's (op. cit.) wide-ranging survey includes an interesting analy-sis of the various Western encounters with the subject, in a critique ofboth the Jungian approach (pace Guenther 1963) and feminist models. Apart from Herrmann-Pfandt, other feminist writers in the field include Rita Gross (1989, 1993), Janice Willis (1989), Miranda Shaw (1994), Anne Klein (1995), and June Campbell (1996). There is also the synthetic account of Chinnamasta Vajra-yogini from Buddhist and Saiva sources by Elisabeth Anne Benard (1994), and studies that touch on the subject from other academic disciplines, such as David Gellner's (1992) anthropological work, or Toni Huber's (1999) ethnohistorical study ofT sari, a region in Tibet associated with Cakrasaf!1vara and Vajravarahi. 19 The problems of defining tantra in the Buddhist context have been explored in recent years, for example by Hodge (1994: 58-59). A full overview of the dif-ficulties and how various scholars have attempted to meet them is given in Lopez (1996: 78-104), and contributions to the subject continue, e.g., Williams and Tribe (2000: 196, 197 ff.). 20 The figures for the Tibetan translations are reached by counting the texts in the tantric sections of the Tibetan bKa' 'gyur and bsTan 'gyur, both from the Tohoku Catalogue of the Derge edition (T oh/D) of 1733, and from the Otani Catalogue"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 3-4 of the Beijing Qianlong «lition (Ota/Q) of 1717-20. (Figures remain approxi-mate, as there are other editions of the canon that vary slighdy, and also manu-script «litions that did not undergo revisions and so include texts not found in later editions.) The rGyud 'bum section of the bKa' 'gyur (foh/D 36o-845) numbers just under five hundred texts, and there are in addition about twenty-four dhir.u)i tats (from the gZungs 'dus section, Toh/D 846-no8) not con-tained here. This means that in all there are about five hundred and ten tanuic texts in the bKa' 'gyur of the Dergc edition. The rGyud section of the bs Tan 'gyur (Toh/D II09-3785) includes just under two thousand seven hundred texts. An additional tantra coUecrion appears in the Beijing and Nanhang bsTan 'gyurs (OtafQ 46<>4-5183) that contains about five hundred texts over and above those found in the Derge bsTan 'gyur. This brings the number of tantric texts in the different bs Tan 'gyur «litions to just under three thousand two hundred. I thank Dr. Hermann-Pfandr for this information (2002: personal communication). Sec also Sanderson 1998: 661, and Williams and Tribe 2000: 195. As for the Sanskrit texts, BBK lists 1,500 Sanskrit tantric texts, although Isaac-son (1998) notes that there are many texts not listed there. Matsunami (1965) lists about forty pages of tanrric Sanskrit texts. 21 A ponion of the Ntimamantrtirthdvalokini, Vilasavajra's commentary upon the Aryamaiijuirindmasa'!'giti (or Ndmma'!lgih), has been edited and translated by Tribe in his unpublished doctoral thesis (1994) and discussed in a published anicle (1997: 109-36). For the life of this yogatantra scholar (also known as Lilavajra), sec Dudjom 1991: 463. 22 Skorupski (1994: 201 n. 47), for example, notes that the commentators on the Sa,putodbhavatantra, such as Indrabhiiti, use the phrase \"yoga and yogini tanrras\"; cf. Kriydsamuccaya f. 409: yoginiyogatanfrr!u. 23 Gellner (1992: 373· n. 5) notes that \"veiled and peripheral references to sexual rites do occur\" rather earlier in the yogatantras, for example in chapter 5 of the STTS. Cf. Sanderson 1994i: 97 n. 1. 2.4 Snellgrove (1959 vol. 1: 12-13) dates the HnJajratantra from the latter eighth to early ninth century, using the qtyth ofPadmasambhava's connection with King lndrabhti. Herrmann-Pf.mdt (Herrmann 1983) comments that this conncaion is doubtful because the Padmasambhava myth belongs to later rNying rna apolo-getics from the twelfth century. The evidence of Taranatha, who makes the eminent commentator Kil)ha a contemporary of the eminent King Devapala (first half of the ninth century; Snellgrove 1959 vol. 1: 14), is likewise untrust-wonhy (see Isaacson 2001: 458 n. 4> who also discusses the commentator's name). It is, in fact. extremely difficult to date the emergence of the yoginitantras. Although Heruka-type material was in existence from the mid-eighth century (in the SarvabuddhasamJyogatjlikinijlilala'!lvara, sec n. 2.6 bdow), neither the Hroajratantra nor the Caltrasa'!'varatantra were transmitted into Tibet until the second diffusion (from the latter tenth century). The dating of translators and commentators is helpful, but this tells us only that the tantras were in exis-tence by the late tenth or early eleventh centuries at the time the commentaries"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 4-9 and translations were written. For example Gaya(a)dhara, translator of the Hevajratantra, was active in the second quarter of the eleventh century, and its commentator Ratnakarasanti was a pupil ofNaropa's, and datable to the early eleventh century (Mimaki 1992: 297 n. I); the first commentary on the Cakrasarrzvaratantra is late tenth century. But we still do not know how long the tantras had been in existence before this; and given the exegetical produc-tivity of the period, there is no reason to assume that the texts are much older than their commentaries. It is also unclear which tantra is the older of the two. The Hevajratantra is built upon a mal).<;iala of the older Sarvabuddha-samdyogarjakinijalafarrzvara, which may indicate its antiquity; but on the other hand, it is more coherent than the Cakrasarrzvaratantra, and many of its meth-ods are more sophisticated (as in its system of four joys, ch. 3 with n. 195) and more attractive to exegetical expansion (Sanderson 2002: personal communi-cation). As for the Kalacakra tradition, Newman (1998: 343) has concluded that its root texts were completed \"between 1025 and ca. 1040,\" although Isaacson notes (op. cit.: 457 n. 2) that Ratnakara5anti \"shows nowhere (to my knowledge) any awareness of the Kalacakra-system and its literature.\" Davidson (2002) offers some comments on dating of yogottara and yogini traditions. 25 YSCT: p. 839 ch. v.

See Tanaka 1994: 323; cf. Abe 1999: 260 and Tsuda 1999: 305. I thank Professor Sanderson (1995; 2002: personal communication) for these references. 27 Our authors were well aware that the variant orthography points to two dif-ferent etymologies: farrz-, \"bliss,\" is used as a synonym for sdta, sukha, and there is no doubt an allusion intended to Siva, the \"creator of bliss\" (farrz-kara) (Isaac-son 2001: personal communication). \"Sarpvara\" (literally, \"restraint\") was prob-ably just a shorthand for \"Cakrasarpvara.\" The two different spellings occur in the Tibetan translations also ( bde mchog for Sarpvara, and sdom pa for Sarpvara). 28 GSS16 (K75v3): tantre lak!abhidhane hi ndthena kathitd svayam. 29 According to the colophons of the Tibetan manuscripts, the Legends are a trans-lation of the Caturafitisiddhaprav_rtti of Abhayadatta from the twelfth century, although Tatz (1989) is not convinced of their Indian origin and points out that neither the purported author (Abhayadatta) nor the translator (sMon grubs shes rab) have been identified with any degree of certainty. In his translation, Dowman (1985: 384, appendix I) decribes the Legends as belonging to The Cycle of Blessings of the Eighty-Four Indian Mahdsiddhas (rGya gar grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi'i byin brlabs chos skor), a cycle of texts found in the bsTan 'gyur and also in the sGrub thabs kun btus.

Abhayakaragupta is an important author and translator, and in his history in the Blue Annals, he is said to be the transmitter of the *Sadhana-samuccaya (p. 1048). Twenty-four works are ascribed to him in Cordier's bs Tan 'gyur (cited Bhattacharyya 1972: 9, see also Bi.ihnemann 1994, 1992). 34 The other work by Umapatideva in the bsTan 'gyur is a Vajrayogini mal).4ala rite (1584 in the Derge edition). Vagisvaragupta and Rwa Chos rab were also co-translators of a number ofKalacakra texts (1358, 1359, 1362, 1392, 1393, and 1394). 35 Apart from his work with Vagisvaragupta, Rwa Chos rab translated another six texts (365, 440, 1374, 1754, 1755, and 1964), five of them with Samanta5ri, includ-ing two ofSamantasri's own compositions. It seems that Rwa Chos rab flour-ished in the early twelfth century. His dates may be tentatively deduced from two sources. First, the Blue Annals (p. 756) lists the \"followers of the Rwa-lo tra-dition\" and places Rwa Chos rab two lineage successions after \"Kalacakra Junior,\" who is identified with Naropa who died in 1040 (Newman 1991:65-76, Wylie 1982: 691) and two lineage successions before another datable translator, rGya lo (1203-82). The second source is the biography of Rwa Chos kyi grags pa (eleventh to early twelfth century, introducer ofYamantaka to Tibet), which describes Rwa Chos rab as his nephew and pupil. This biography (which is said to have been written by Chos rab's own pupil, successor, and possibly son, Rwa Ye shes seng ge; see Blue Annals: 756), states that after the death of Rwa Chos kyi grags pa (Tibetan text p. 343): \"His heart son [principal pupil], Locchava Rwa Chos-rab continued his activities for five years. Then he went to Nepal [where he met Samantasri].\" The deathdate of the uncle, Rwa Chos kyi grags pa, is therefore significant. He seems to have died in the early twelfth century since his biography, though fantastical, states that he outlived Mar pa Chos kyi blo gros (pupil of the elderly Naropa, and teacher of Milarepa, who died c. 1096). It also states that he traveled in the same group with Ras chung pa to India. According to the Lho rong chos 'byung (r T a-tshag T she-dbang rGyal, Lho-rong Chos-'byung, China: Bod-ljongs dPe-yig dPe-rnying dPe-skrun-khang, 1994: 87), Ras chung pa's visit to India took place c. 1IIO (Roberts 2000: 294,"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 14-19 391 32.8-19, 411-13.) This would place Rwa Chos rab's visit to Nepal (Newman 1991: 76)-where according to Bu ston he stayed for five years, ten months, and five days-in the first half of the twelfth century. Rwa Chos rab is also said to have uavcled with Samanwri to Tibet, where they transmitted and translated Kalacakra teachings (in the \"Rwa-locchiva tradition,\" Blw Amuds: 756, 789, Newman ibiJ.).

Rin 'byung brgya rtsa or jewel Mine of Hundred [texts] is itself an abbrevi-ation for Taranatha' s collection, the full title of which is: The Mine of jewels, Sadhanas of the Ocean of Yidam Deities: Yi dam rgya mtsho 'i sgrub thabs rin chen 'byung gnas. This collection has been reprinted in two volumes in New Delhi, 1974-76, as Jo nang rJe btsun Taranatha's Yi-dam rgya-mtsho'i sgrub-thabs rin-chen 'byung-gnas: A Collection of Sadhanas for Invoking the Various Tutelary Deities of Lamaism (Willson and Brauen 2000: 231, 233 n. r; Tachikawa op.cit.). Large as Taranatha' s work already was, the fourth Pal! chen bLa rna added to it to compile his own text as the basis for the empowerment ceremony of 1810, presenting for each practice both a sadhana text and a rite conferring permis-sion. This work is called The Clear Meaning of the jewel Mine, an Expansion of \"The Mine of jewels, Sadhanas of the Ocean of Yidam Deities\" (Yi dam rgya mtsho 'i sgrub thabs rin chen 'byung gnas kyi lhan thabs Rin 'byung don gsal). This was also published in New Delhi in 1974 by Lokesh Chandra under the title Sadhana-Mala of the Panchen Lama bsTan-pa'i-Nyi-ma Phyogs-las rNam-rgyal. The abbreviated title for this work, which appears in the margin of each page, is Rin lhan. Bi.ihnemann (1994: 14-15) notes that the Rin lhan has its roots in the collection of sadhanas translated as the Sadhanafataka about the turn of the twelfth century or earlier (and also, according to Chandra, in the Sadhana-sdgara; op.cit.: 45-46). The fourth chter of the Rin lhan is dedicated to sadhanas ofVajravarahi (Tachikawa 1995: IO, Chandra 1986 vol.r, p. 47). Where icons from the Mongolian pantheon are used below, I have com-pared the relevant Sanskrit sadhana of the Guhyasamayasadhanamalawith the Tibtean source; for this, I have relied upon the translations of the Rin lhan/Rin 'byung brgya rtsa given by Willson and Brauen (op.cit.: 252-62). In these instances, I have noted the Tibetan title and mantras (although normalizing the orthography of the Sanskrit). I number the Mongolian icons according to the woodblock prints published in 1995 by Tachikawa et al., and to the painted images of the Icons Worthwhile to See published in 2000 by Willson and Brauen (T/IWS), and I also crossrefer to the different numbering system of the line-drawings commissioned by Lokesh Chandra (LC) on the basis of the wood-block prints, several of which are reproduced in chter 2. 58 An analysis and critical comparison of these different publications is given by Willson and Brauen (2000: 7-22). The woodblock prints published by Tachikawa et al. are chiefly located at the Indian Institute of the University of Hamburg (the missing folios of this set-8 percent of the whole-being found in the Library ofTibetan works and Archives in Dharamsala; Tachikawa et al. 1995: 3). No further information is given by the editors as to the origin of this set. Willson and Brauen (op. cit.: 8) note, however, that there are apparently other copies: two in St. Petersburg and one in Ulan-Ude. There is also one set in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGE 37 Brauen's discussion highlights the difficulty of nomenclature for the Mon-golian icons. Lokesh Chandra (e.g., 1986, 1987) refers to them as the \"Narthang Pantheon,\" apparently basing this on nineteenth-century scholar-ship that mistakenly claimed that the blockprints were from Narthang Monastery in Tibet (op.cit.: xvii). The title \"Narthang Pantheon\" has been mistakenly picked up by other secondary authors, such as von Schroeder (20or). Tachikawa et al. (1995) corrected this to Five Hundred Buddhist Deities. Brauen points out, however, that while there are just over five hundred (507) images (and Tibetan sources do refer to \"five hundred images\": sKu brnyan lnga brgya), many depict more than one deity, both male and female. He notes that the authentic Tibetan title of the blockprint set is Bris sku mthong ba don ldan, translated as Icons Worthwhile to See (IWS). Willson and Brauen' s pub-lication of the painted icons therefore appears under the title Deities o[Tibetan Buddhism: The Zurich Paintingofthe '1cons Worthwhile to See (Bris sku mthon don ldan).\" 59 As for the origins of the set published by Lokesh Chandra, he writes (2001: per-sonal communication): \"The line-drawings are based on an original xylogra-phy my father Prof. Raghu Vira brought from Ulan Bator in 1955, on a photocopy of the Leningrad copy, and also on the copy of Prof. Lessing. The Tibetan artists who worked with me had to consult all the three prints to clar-ify the details. The work of tracing and drawing was completed in 1960.\" In the absence of a clearer set of woodblock prints, such as that produced by Tachikawa et al., the Tibetan artists seem to have been concerned with pro-ducing both clear copies and images that were artistically pleasing in their own right. This led to a number of changes that are internally consistent within the set but that have altered aspects of the original woodblocks. Thus, the dimen-sions of the drawings differ and, while standard, are more rectangular than the woodblock prints; the mantras for each deity appear below the images (rather than on the reverse, as on the woodblock prints). The artists have also drawn clouds in the background, sometimes adding foreground landscape too (much as the painters of the IWS have done), replacing the simple sun and moon that flank the deities in some of the woodblocks. They have also used a different convention for the lotus, drawing downward-pointing lotus leaves rather than the upward-pointing leaves of the woodblocks. 6o Sanderson (1988: 668) notes that these classifications are postscriptural and belong to a period of systemization of nondual Saiva traditions in the ninth and tenth centuries in Kashmir. For a detailed analysis of the dating of the Saiva tantras themselves, see Sanderson 2oorb. The nouns mantra (masculine) and vidya (feminine) in Mantrapi~ha and Vidyapi~ha signify \"sacred sound-for-mulas\" (ibid: 669), and Sanderson comments that the progression in termi-nology from masculine to feminine is another indication of the progressive tendency within the Bhairava tantras toward extolling feminine power. (It is worth noting, perhaps, that the pure, dualistic tradition of the Saiva Siddhanta also belongs to the Mantramarga).See also Dyczkowski 1988."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 38-•H 397 61 For the chief cremation ground cults, the Picrlm4tllbrahm4J4mtd4tllntra is the authority (approximately 1,2.00 verses on the cult of Cat}Qa Kapalini and KapiliSabhairava; Sanderson 1995).

This is evidently a fragment from the vafyavidhi described in the preceding sadhana (SM219), which in turn is a ritual applying to the previous sadhana (SM218) (see GSS38 with appendix entry). Perhaps misled by the fact that SM22o describes Vajravarahi here as \"dancing\" (which may be most evident iconographically in the ardhaparyanka forms of deities, but which is frequently also an aspect of warrior-stance forms), von Schroeder takes this line of text as the basis for coin-ing the appellation \"Vasya-Vajravarahi'' for ardhaparyanka chopper-holding forms ofVajravarahi (see many plates in publications published 1981 and 2001, with 2001: 1052). As this form ofVajravarahi is associated with all types of rites, not just rites of subjugation, this appellation is misleading. It is also based on the scantiest of evidence, and in fact von Schroeder's source (GSS220) is actu-ally a continuation of the previous two works (SM218 and SM219), and the pose intended for this form is rather the reverse warrior stance (pratyiilirjhab) and not the ardhaparyanka at all. Ironically, von Schroeder does state that the form is in the \"pratyiilirjha\" pose, but he confuses this term with ardhaparyanka, erroneously describing the former as \"dancing on the left foot with the right leg raised and bent\" (2001: 1052)-that is, as the ardhaparyanka pose (seen. 81). In this same entry (ibid), von Schroeder correctly points out that the hog's head is not mentioned in any of the SM sadhanas, although the reason for this is because these sadhanas do not focus on the hog-headed ardhaparyanka form ofVajravarahi but on her warrior-stance forms, which are invariably without a hog's head. 84 There are plenty of published depictions of the ardhaparyanka-pose Vajra-varahi. Some of the earliest, including a few contemporary with our texts, are early Indian statues in late Pala style dating from the eleventh to twelfth"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"402 NOTES TO PAGES 50-51 centuries (von Schroeder 2001: plates usA-E), and thlnecnth-ccntury Nepalese (ibid: plate 1738-E) and twdfch-thineenth-century Tibetan sculptures (ibid: plates 2.89A-C, 29sA. 94A-F; Leidy and Thwman 1998: plate 17).

Ratnikamanti's commentary upon it. 100 The corpses beneath Vajravarahi's feet are not mentioned in the Sanskrit text for the main deity. but all the goddesses of the retinue stand upon corpses. which in the case of the four goddesses on the petals are named as the Saiva deities (GSS7l<4or6): pr~tap.rf!k 'rdhaparyanka viluz!Otlt4fllbhi!fl!Jiib I bhairaVIl/1 ka/4rtitri1 ca tkvya pddatak k,rtau.

In depicting the image from the text in figure 4. we have therefore not followed the particular order of the verses (which are determined by the meter) but base the drawing on the attributes as held by Cakrasarpvara (table s).

Here, however, the mal}4a}a includes four goddesses in the intermediate directions of the outer temple, instead of the bow and arrow described in our text. Other practices in the GSS, in which the female deity is the main partner, are those ofVajravilasini and Guhyavajravilasini, discussed below. The six-armed Vajravarahi and its sources are noted by Herrmann-Pfandt (1997: 2.1-2.6) and its implications for feminist discourse discussed; Simmer-Brown (2.001: 158-60) offers a critique of this approach. Other exam-ples of ritual and meditative contexts for the yum Jllb practice are also docu-mented Herrmann-P&ndt (1992.: 32.5-2.8; 2.001: 58<r82.) and Simmer-Brown (op.cit.: 331-32. nn. 10~-s). The Mongolian icons (IWS/T 88, LC 598) illustrate the figure entided Sahaja Reversed (Go br.log /han sltyn). Here, the male deity takes the role reversal so far as to adopt Vajravarahi's implements. In the sadhana of the Rin 'byung brgyll rt:sa (Willson and Brauen 2.000: 2.61-62.), Vajrayogini is white, with one face and two arms. She holds a lotw stem in each hand, one \"marked\" with (i.e., bearing) a vajra, the other a bell. She sits upon a spotted antelope skin in the vajrapaTJIIMil and holds Sarpvara \"in her lap.\" Her coruon is depicted smaller and with his back toward us, holding the attributes normally assigned to Vajrayogini. In his left hand he brandishes a chopper, and his right arm embraces Vajrayogini and simultaneously pours blood from the skull bowl into his own mouth. Neither wears any ornaments or garments.

The Tibetan go bzlog (\"reversed\") translates the Sanskrit viparita as in viparita-surata-(also known as puTUfiiyitam), which indicates a so-called reversed or inverted position for lovemaking (Sanderson 2001: personal communication). In the language of Indian erotology, this position is one in which the woman is said to \"act like a man\" in relation to her lover (Kdmasutra 2.8.17: miyalu niiyilui puTUfavad iicarrd iti puTUfliyita'f!l). in that she lies on top of him (Kiima-sutra 2.8.1-3): niiyaltasya sa,tatiibhyiisiit pariiramam upalabhya riigasya ciinu-paiamam anumatii una tam adho 'vapiitya puTUfiiyittna siihiiyya'!' dadyiit (I) sviibhipriiyiid vii viltalpayojaniirthini (I) niiyaltalturuha/iid vii): \"Having seen that the male lover has become tired because of [their] continual lovemaking [lit: practice] and that his passion is not yet assuaged, with his permission she should put him underneath [her] and help him by means of the puTUfiiyita [position]. Alternatively, [she may do this] because she desires to unite differendy by her own wish, or because the male lover is curious.\" Another example in Tibetan art of a yum yab figure is one mentioned to me by Robert Beer (2001: personal communication), who writes, \"The only major deity I know of who appears in Yum-Yab is the Karma bKa' brgyud protector Palden lllamo in union with Dorje Bernagchen. This union of deities is known as ma-mgon zhal-sbyor meaning 'Mother Protector Face to Face,' and origi-nates from a vision of the second Karma-pa, Karma Pakshi. Here the four-armed form of Palden Utamo/Sri Mata Devi (Rang-'byung gya/ mo) sits facing outwards on her blue 'iron mule,' whilst the dwarf form of Mahakala as Ber-nag-can (the Black-Cloaked) is seated upon her lap. The mass of cloaks and silks that cover both deities depicts nothing of their sexual union.\" 105 O'f!l frivajraviiriihi iiJ; va'!' hu'!' hu'!' phaf sviihii • hu'!' hu'!'] ADUT B147r2; hu'!' hu'!' hu'!'

The mdltimantra (o1JI hii'!' va'!' jll/1) is also given in GSS45 (KI40n). 138 Willson and Brauen (2000: 26o-61). The Tibetan text of the visualization seems to be loosely based on that of the Sanskrit, although it also includes other elements, such as the vase consecration (\"flask empowerment•) and the emanation of countless other Vajrayoginis and other enlightened deities. It also includes a visualization ofVajrapoif)i in Heruka aspect overcoming demons and throwing them into a vajra well produced from hii,., \"stabbing them with the dagger and reducing them to dust with the vajra\" (with the mantra 0'!' hri gha gha ghtilllya ghatllya hii'!' phaf).

It is worth noting that there was an adept called Kurmapada, who was associated with the Vajravarahi tradition through his lineal descent from Ghal).~apada (Blue Annals pp. 754, 803). Ghal).~iipada was one of the main transmitters of the Cakrasarp.vara tra-dition (n. 356), although whether he had any connection with this practice I do not know. 140 GSS36 (K:r2ov6-12rr): ... divydm.rtam iva yogidravyarrt nivedayet. Isaacson (1997: personal communication) suggests this may be the same as the Saiva viradravya, which consist of the five nectars, plus onion, garlic, human flesh, beef, goat's meat, fish, and fowl. 141 For a description of the bali rite according to Vajravarahi texts, see ch. 3; cf.

The Tibetan sadhana is a self-visualization in which Vajrayogini is described in typical kapalika terms, with three eyes, hair black and loose, and wearing all the bone ornaments with a garland of dry heads. (The artist of the IWS deviates from the text by giving her yellow hair.) The Tibetan text also prescribes a Vajravarahi mantra, although one closer to her thirteen-syllabled mantra than the ten-syllabled mantra of GSS36: Or[l vajra-vairocaniye hiirrt phat svdhd. 145 Three GSS works prescribe the self-visualization of the Vidyadhari goddess (GSS21, GSS22, and GSS23), and there is also a reference to one of her rites in the Abhisamayamafijari (GSS5 Sed p. 153, K38rr-38r6). Other GSS texts also describe her mountainous abode (GSSro, GSS16). This manifestation of Vajrayogini has a particular association with the adept Sahara, as many of these texts will show, an association confirmed by the hagiography of Advayavajra that appears in the *Siddha-Amndya (see appendix). The classical reference to Vidyadharis is from Kalidasa's Kumdrasambhava I.7. 146 GSS21 (K85r6): tadbijapari!latdr[l raktam urdhvapadordhvadr!tirrt kapdlamalii-veffitakardrrt pUfpamdliipiifasavydgrdr[l dakfi!le vajrahastdr[l sarvabhara!lavini < r>-muktdrrt vidyadharikramayuktdr[l sphuratsarrthdravigrahdr(l, mdndiiraviifokapdri-"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 79-80 jataltodbhiita'!' rllt1Uikii!4'!' <gha'!'>(mg2) praviillntim titmllna'!' bhlivayn. • sarvtibharll!\"'] em.; sarvtlvarll!\"' K • sarry4grli'!'] conj.

The text of the Rin 'byung brgya rtsa is similar to our Sanskrit sources in its description ofVajrayogini as naked and bearing a gar-land (though not a garland noose). Her pose is described as follows: \"Her left hand holds a skull full of nectar and, embracing her left leg in the hollow of the kn«, raises it up so that a stream of nectar pours into her mouth. Her right hand holds a five-pointed vajra, thrusting it toward the right h«l. The right leg is not quite extended, as if flying. Holding in her left hand a garland of Nlga tree flowers, she stands naked and without ornaments .... \" However, the Tibetan sadhana reveals a far more wrathful deity, with frown and bared f.angs, who is aligned not with Vajrayogini, but with Vajravidhi (\"I appear in the form of Lady Vajravarahi Vidyadhari-kcli\") and crowned with Alqobhya.

Sanderson explains it as follows (2001: personal communication): \"The afokiiftamivratam is so called, according to the paurii1Jika sources that advocate it, because one observing it is to drink/eat eight afoka blossoms after first offering a piija to Rudra with such blossoms on the eighth of the bright fortnight of Caitra and because by doing so one will become afokab, i.e., free of grief. The source is a passage in the Hemadri ( Caturvargacintiima1Ji vol. 2 part I, pp. 862-63 Kashi; Sanskrit Fi.irer 235), which cites the Lingapurii1Ja and the Kiirmapurii1Ja.

Tanaka's introduction to the Chinese version of the Loltdvara-ltalpa (the Yi-qu-fo sht-xiang-ying dtl-jiao wang-jing shmg-p4n-zi-ZIIi pu-sa nun-song yi-gui) suggests that the cult of Padmanartdvara subsided with the rise of the Heruka family, bequeathing the tradition little else than a few shon sadhanas.

However, Padmanartdvara's fame evidendy continued beyond this, since he is still imponant in the I;Jaltinivajrapanjaratantra (Isaacson 1999: per-sonal communication). In the Cakrasarpvara tradition, Padmanartdvara appears as an attendant deity on the southwest spoke of the lulyacaltra in the Cakrasarpvara maJ]<Jala in union with Mahabala (see table 23).

ChinnamW)<Ja is the name given by all the sidhanas in the bsTan 'gyur (Benard 1994: 18 n. 35; see the appendix for details). Thus, for example, the Tibetan translation of the Llk,mistiJhana (GSS24) is entitled the *Chinnamu!J#-vajravtirdhistiJhana (Benard 1994: 66). Similarly, in the Nandylivartatraya-multhdgamandma attributed to Mekhala and Kanakhala (sDe dgc bsT an 'gyur rgyuJ '\"lvol. 43 (Zi): 34-35), the sadhaka is instructed to visualize himself as JBu bcaJ ma yum, i.e., as \"ChinnamW)<Ja\" Vajravirihi (ibid: 14). A Chinna-mu!'f!d StiJhana also appears in the Rin 'byung brtJ4 rtsa, \"Vajrayogini of the Severed Head\" (rDo 1]~ mal 'byor ma Jbu bcaJ ma). or, according to Tiranatha, \"Vajravarahi of the Severed Head\" (rDo 1]~ phag mo Jbu bcaJ ma) (W\"illson and Brauen 2.000: 2.59-6o), details for which see below n. 2.10.

The text of the Rin 'byung brgya rtsa dif-fers considerably from our Sanskrit sources, as the three deities are first self-visualized as one-headed forms of Vajrayogini (in warrior stance, uampling Bhairava and K.alaratri, and holding the usual attributes, chopper and skull bowl, including a skull staff for the central figure). They are visualized as orange (Sarvabuddha<Jalcini in the center), green (\"Vajravaf9ani\" to the left), and yel-low (\"Vairocani\" to the right), with garlands and bone ornaments of the five mudras, very wrathful amid blazing fire.

The self-visualization then continues, as the meditator sees the principal deity cutting off her own head and holding it aloft by the hair \"with the three eyes looking downward.\" The text continues: \"From the severed central channel in her neck, a jet of mixed white and red bodhicitta pours into her own mouth; from the left chan-nel, lalanii, a jet of'semen' (kunda) mixed with Alq;obhya pours into the mouth of the left deity; and from the right channel, rasanii, menstrual blood (rajas) mixed with ordinary blood pours into the mouth of the right one.\" The sadhana then continues with other meditations and rites. The Mongolian icons also depict this sadhana, illustrating each deity sepa-rately. The central deity, Chinnamasta (dBu bead rna), is not shown with her head severed (IWS/T 81, LC 591), and she is described as a form ofVajravarahi. \"Vajravarl)ani\" (rDo rje rab sngags rna) is seen as green, and painted in the IWS with a skull staff not given in the text or woodblock prints (IWS/T 82, LC 592, in which she is called \"Vajrapral)ava\"). \"Vairocani\" (rNam snang rna) is yel-low, also with the addition of a skull staff in the IWS (IWS/T 83, LC 593). 2n GSS9 (K44v5): hrdi niiniivan:zapa1J1-kiirapari~iimena vifvapadma1J1. bhiivayet. atropari raktarephapari~iimena siiryama~rjale dhannodaya1J1. samadhikarakta-va~a1J1. bhiivayet. dhannodayopari raktava~a1J'l hri1J1-kiira1J1.. hri1J1-kiiriidibhip piirvoktaip samastaip pari~iimena vajrayogini1J1. kanakafyiimii1J1. siiryiisane padma-madhye. tathiitra piirfve ~kinidvaya1J1. bhiivayet. kartrikarotadharii1J1. iilitjha-padasa1J1-sthitii1J1.. • ~kinidvayam] SM234; sii(hu?)ladvaya1J1.

The association of the unit vajrapufpa-with rites of worship is apparently borne out by the Sadhanamiilii.

The next offerings are made to Sarvabuddh~ni \"in front\" (or to \"Buddha4ikini\" in GSS30 and SM134), to Vajravar~ani (usually left) \"in the south/right\" (Ja/qi!J~). and to Vajra-vairocaru (usually right) \"to the west/behind\" {p41dwu).

The lotuses at the head cakra (ch. 31, vv. 19-23) and at the navel cakra (ch. 31, vv. 27-31) are both said to have a seed-syllable at their center, each of which gives rise to a god-dess attended by Lalana and Rasana, SUT ch. 31 (vv. 29-3oab): lalana prajfiasvariipetza rasanopayena sa'l'(lsthita I tayor madhyagata'l'(l devi a'l'(lktira'l'(l vifvariipitzi I 29 I catufkdyatmaka'l'(l devi sarvasiddhipradiiyini.

Sircar's thesis-that these four sites represent an ancient grouping from which longer lists of sites later developed-is refuted by Kalff (1979: 101). Sircar (op. cit.: 12) notes the appearance of this fourfold set in HTr.7.12: pipha'l'(l jalandhara'l'(l khyata'l'(l o~~iyana'l'(l tathaiva ca I pipha'l'(l paurtzagirif caiva kamariipa'l'(l tathaiva ca. Sanderson (2001: personal communication) has remarked that although in Saiva sources, Oqqiyal).a, Purt:agiri, and Kamarupa often appear with Jalan-dhara as a set of sites, he has seen no other reference to Srihana/Sylhet (evi-dence of the east Indian basis of this set) in any tantric Saiva scripture. However, it appears that it is found in the Nath tradition, as Sanderson records its pres-ence, in texts teaching the yoga of the Nath yogins.

In popular epic tales, such as those recounted in the V\"tkrllmllCaritll, the hero is able to demonstrate his unflinching faith by offering blood from his own throat to the goddess as an act of faith, e.g., Viltrll1N1Cilritll ch. 7 and ch. 8; Ktzthbzritsligu11 (Somadcva 1994: 216-19). The motif also appears in the mythology oflocal cults, as in the folktales and devotional songs of Rajasthan, in which a warrior-hero (the jhumjhllr ji or bhomiytz) slices his head off before the batde (or loses it in the course of bat-de), but fights on to kill many enemies before dying himself (Kothari 1989; J. Smith 1991: 90). Myths in south India tell of the goddess Rc~uka, who both loses and rcgairu her head, based on the P~c tale in the BhligllVIIIIlpUrli!fll ch. 9.16. (Local vari-ants to the myth have been explored by Sonya Stark and discussed in a paper given at Wolfson College, Oxford, Michaelmas Term 1996, entided \"Who Is Rc~uka? Some Mythological and Ritualistic Aspects of a Popular South Indian Goddess: See also Benard (1994= 6) on the Mllh4bh4rlltll (3.II7·5-19). The theme is also popular in the Saiva tradition, which devdops its own tra-dition ofChinnamasti, borrowing and adapting from the Trikayavajrayogini cult. Chinnamasti is one of the ten Mahavidyas (emanations of Sari); her sev-ered-headed form is explained in a myth recounted in the SUtismpgllmlltllntrll (4-5.152-73) (seeS. Gupta 2000). Sanderson (2001: personal communication) dates the earliest evidence for Chinnamasti worship in Saivism to the work of Sarvinandanitha, one of the earliest east Indian tantric authors, living in Bangladesh probably in the fifteenth century. Included in a list of some sixty-four Saiva tantras from the T~i4tllntrll (vv. 2.2-20), Sarvinandanatha (SIIr-110lltisll3.1-29) hdpfully quotes a section from the jlilinlulvipll that mentions Chinnamasti (3.23). This passage lists ten Mahavidyas: Kili, Tara, Tripuri, Bhuvandvari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasti, Dhiimivati, Bagalamukhi, Mataligi, and Kamala (Sanderson ibiJ.). See also Kinsley (1997: 144-66), Pal (1981: 79--86) for Chinnamasti as one of the ten Mahavidyas, and the full discussions by Bilhnemann that chronicle the Hindu borrowings from the Buddhist tra-dition (2000i: 37-38, 107-12). Sakta ~aivas adopted Chinnamasti into their ritual practices, and p;uidhatis for her worship appear throughout the period to the present day (Sanderson 1999: personal communication). Benard (1994= 33-J-4) describes a Chinnamasti sidhana from the Chinn~~ntllltlitllntrll that forms part of the nineteenth-century ~ Jlr4motl4 (a popular manual of tantric ritual for puji of the ten 1Nlh4viJy4s and panaukvatll}. B. Bhattacharyya (1932: 159-61) compares the iconography and mantras of the Buddhist [Trikiya]vajrayogini and the \"Hindu Chinna-masti'\" from the later l4lttll texts, the T11ntraslirll and the Chinn~~mASt4/uJpa.

De Mallmann (1975: 339) provides a separate entry on \"Sarvabuddha4akini,\" stating that Tibetan sources equate her with Naro-9ikini (also called Na9i-9ikini), a form of Vajravarahi related to the adept Naropa. She mentions the appearance of Sarvabuddha4ikini in three sadhanas in the StiJhllnllmtilil (SM234-GSS9=GSS3o, SM236-GSS19, and SM249=blliivitJhi from GSS2I), although here the name Sarvabuddhaqakini occurs only within the mantras, and the goddess of the practice is actually called Vajrayogini. De Mallmann overlooks other occurrences in the same mantras in other sadhanas (e.g., SMus, SMu6, SM232, and SM233). Bhattacharyya h92.4i198s: n. ISS) seems to equate Sarvabuddha4ikini with the Trikayavajrayogini form; he states, \"The headless form is designated in the Mantra as Sarvabuddha4alclni, while the other form is called in the Mantra as Vajrayogini {sic}.\" In fact, he is referring to four sadhanas, llil of which usc the mantra epithet Sarvabuddha-4akini, and he also overlooks all the other sadhanas that give this mantra. Bunce (1994: 480) refers to Sarvabuddhaqakini as the \"patroness of the Sa skya sect.\" 229 This is a particular topos of the twenty-one-verse Itotrll (GSS42), in which she is said to appear as the goddess of other religious systems (sec the appendix) and in many forms and colors, e.g., v. nab (KI26r6): lllt't1HiillyllVIlinutifNI nirmi-t4nnuzriipi!Ji • VlllnutifNI] C; VllSnutivll K • nirmit4n~ltllriipi!Jt] em.; nirmit4-nlliluzrupi!Ji K. nirmit4 ~ltllriipi!Ji C. 230 GSSs (Sed p. 152, K37r4): tllJ ~11'111dayllp siJJhopade/llpllrllmp~trliyitli vinryiilllJilbh~JtiJ llMntti bhllgllVIltyli llmnliya boJJhllVJiil!. dinntlitrllm ilill'!'

He also gives other examples, e.g., SUTch. 8.2-3b (f. 12v6): svagrhefu guptasthiine vijane ca manorame I girigahvarakufi}efU mahodadhitafefu vii I fmafiine miit[grhe ca nadisarrzgamamadhyatap; and ibid.: f. 20r. 4-5; Yoginijiilamahiitantra (f. 30v.9, 16.13): girigahvarakufi}efu mahodadhitafefu ca I catufpathefU matzrfapasthiine fmafiine ca manorame; ADU (f. 14.5, 4.5c): girigahvarakufi}efu naditirefu sarrzgame mahodadhitafe ramye I ekavrkfe fiviilaye miit[grhe fmafiine vii, udyiine vividhottame I vihiiracaityalayane grhe viitha catufpathe; l)iikinijiilasarrzvara (f. 3r.5-6).

The passage in full describes a series of ten postures to be assumed one after the other by the Vajracarya during the preliminary ritual of\"appropriating the site\" (bhiiparigrahavidhif). The first is the vajriisana, in which the legs are in the vajraparyanka and the hands are in the earth-touching mudrii (see Siidhanamiiliivol. 2 cxlviii plate 1). The next is the dhyiiniisana, which is iden-tical except that the hands are in the meditation mudra. After the vajra-paryanka itself comes the padmiisana, in which both knees are on the ground with the left calf placed on the right. This is followed by another seated pos-ture commonly prescribed for sadhana practice, the sattvaparyanka (e.g., SM39 p. 85; SM8o p. 154; SM147 p. 305). This reverses the position of the feet in the vajraparyanka and puts the left foot on top, as stated in the VA: \"Having placed the right foot on top of the left thigh, he should position the left on the surface of the right thigh. This is sattvaparyanka [posture].\" Cf.

For \"whole body,\" ADUT ch. 9 (p.l86) reads \"touch,. (sparl~).

The adept is to adorn himself in a manner that resembles his inner vision of the deity. Thus, in the Tripurasundari tradition, he dresses as a woman in fine red garments, hair and body adorned with red flowers, mouth filled with betel and herbs (to dye it red), the body red with vermilion powder and scented with musk (Nityiiforfasiktin:zava ch. I, vv. 103-5). Assuming the guise of a woman (striropadhtiritvam) was accepted by exegetes such as Bhaskararaya (Setubandhu, ibid.: p. 78): raktakusumasya strivefasya vti parigraha&.

Dvivedi (I992: I2I) traces the statement \"Having become a god, he attains the gods\" to the Vedic corpus (Brhadtirartyakopanifad), and interprets it in the light of comparable statements in the Satapathabrtihmarta to mean that \"having assumed the nature of one's chosen god, one should propitiate gods.\" It is this injunction (fivibhuya fiva'f!l yajet) that is commonly cited in Saiva tantras; e.g., Khanna (I986: 22) notes its appearance in the Svacchanda-tantroddyota. However, its meaning varies according to the different Saiva tra-ditions.

The offerings of guest water arc prescribed in GSS34 (Kli4f): arghap4tlytUJilta'f' dattvi ... pf4!pat/huplidi!ta, Janvi piijayn. The Sllptaratnllni include: a queen (stri0), a minister (pfU'U/Il0), a wish-ful-filling jewel (ma!'i0), a whcd (caltra0), a sword (khat!ga0), an elephant (gaja0), a horse (afva0). The lists vary somewhat (sometimes they include a general, smapati0), and there is also a list of secondary jcwcls (uparatnll!'i). The eight auspicious symbols comprise a pair of golden fishes (suvll11.Jilmatsya}J}, a lotus {patbnam), a treasure vase (nitJhigha!fl!1J, a golden whcd {suva11,14Caham), a banner of victory (Jhvaja/J), an endless knot (lrivatsa/1), a white right-spiraling conch shell (iankhivartaf.J), and a parasol (chama.fJ).

Olschak (1973 p. 87, alsop. 45) provides a set of bronzes illwtrating the sets of symbols. Beer illwtratcs and discusses these offerings (1999: chs. 7-8, pp. 16o-2.03, plates 77-95). 2.59 In yogottara and yoganiruttara texts, the inner worship (aJhytitmaJn1j4) may take the form of the five senses (lui1NtguN1/1) offered within a skull bowl; namely, the heart or body for touch, the eyes for sight, the cars for sound, the nose for smell, and the tongue for taste. These form an esoteric version of the traditional five upaclras (e.g., GST ch. 6, v. 2., p. 17: paiicaltlmagu!Jilir buJJhan puj~J vidhivat s4J4 I paiicopahllrapujabhir 14ghu buJJhatvam tlpn~. Sec Beer for illustrations (1999: 32.5-2.7, plate 140). The inner wor-ship may, however, refer to trangrcssive offerings such as the five nectars and five lights. 2.6o For the secret worship (guhyapiijtl), Beyer (1978: p. 143ff.) lists sixteen vajra goddesses; he distinguishes between the outer, inner, and secret offerings, and also mentions the occasional addition of a truth offering (t4ttvapuj4), describ-ing it as an offering of great bliss, namely, semen (bodhicittllm). On the truth offering, Sanderson (1994 n. 16) notes GST 6.2ocd: guhytullttvamahllpiijli'fl Sll'!'Pii}ya ca vibh4vayn; and GST 8.25: tllru!Ji/1 Sll'!'prtipya subhaga, ctiruvalt-trl'!' su1obh4Nim I aJhif.tllnilp4tJ4'!' Jhy4tv4 tllttvapuja, praltalpaya. The variow types of offering, including the t4ttvapiij4, are referred to in the Advayavajra-based texts, e.g., SM2.51 (p. 490): btihyagu}1)4t4ttvapujivilqmr; GSS44 (I<I39r4): blhyaxuhyapujllvik,Sili/1; GSS 16 (K79n): tata/1 piijllJd. pUfJHlir Jhiipair Jipair g~tntihair NZivet/yllir ni1Nividh4#J piijllbhi/1 paJIIJd. m411017111Jtl-piijl1 t4ttvapuj4tiibhih.

The emphasis on bells for the mwicians and dancers in the Newar tradition echoes the account given here in GSSs (sec Gellner 1992: 1o6 for a full account). For a discussion of the offerings and illwrrations of their artistic depiction, sec Beer (1999: 194-2.03 with plates 92-95). The offerings arc often depicted rogether in a single bowl on the altar table, the mirror in the center, the pair of cymbals flanking it, with the conch shell and fruit to either side of the cym-bals, and the cloth as a scarf draped around the whole (cf. Olschak 1973: 45, K."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 122-123 437 Gyatso 1999: 499). The mantras and hmd gestures (mutirtls) wt accompany the offerings arc illustrated in Beyer (1978: 160 fig. 19), (quite differendy) in K. Gyatso (1999: 492.ff.), and (differendy again) in Tsong ka pa (1987 vol. 2: 127-32). 262 Table 10 summarizes the text ofGSSs (Sed p. 1271\\ KI611-17r).

They are found, however, in the saiprural sidhanas of the HT(l.3.I) and SliT b3.7).

Sanderson (1994, n."},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 129-131 26, citing Asatiga's Karilulsaptati on the VajrllCcktliltaj comments that the \"new\" exegesis of the eighth century can be seen as a direct recycling of the \"old\" school of Asanga and Vasubandhu, in which there is no suggestion that the paratantrasvabhava is a really existent entity.

He also refers to \"certain scholars\" who have argued that \"mind in the Cinamatra tradition ... has no greater reality than any other entity• (namdy, Rahula 1978 pp. 79-85, and Willis 1979). On the other hand, Williams (op. cit.: 89) himself disagrees with this view. He continues, \"I remain unconvinced, however. It is clear in these cases that the negation of mind ( cittalvijflllna) is not a negation of the really existing nondual stream of perceptions ... , but only of the mind as subject• -a view he supports with a citation (ibid: 89-90) from Sthiramati's MaJhyantavibhagapluz and examples from the MahdylinasUirt1/4'f'lt4rtt and Mahtly4nasa,graha. 286 Madhyamalui/a'f'ltllra (vv. 92-93) translated from Tibetan by M.

The latter (GSS5 Sed p. 132, K2ov cited below) refers to, and probably redacts from, Liiyipada's HA. Unfortunately, there is damage to the relevant folios of the HA in the manwcript available (f. 3v). The previow folio (f. 3r) contains the emptiness meditation and mantras followed by the element visualization with Mount Meru (f. 3v), below which the folio is damaged. However, the missing text probably described the circle of protection, becawe the next folio begins with the self-generation of Herukavajra \"within the vajra zone\" (f. ~r4): vAjrapafljara-~···· 292 On the structure of a temple, note the ground plan of Bayon at Angkor given by Snodgrass (1985: 74-75 fig. 30).

M.2.r, p. 31* ms. Bf.u). Despite its reference to PuriJ]ic muras, nisumbha in the Buddhist tantric tradition seems to have been generally understood as an imperative (cf. PUp. 153). 305 See Huntington 1975: 2.-5, with plate 45, etc.; Marcotty 1987: 2.9; and illustra-tions by Beer 1999: 2.45-49, with plate 114-The cult status of the /ti/4 as deity in the Vajrakilaya corpus has been studied by Boord (1993) and Mayer (1996). Examples of deity daggers are given in Huntington (e.g., figs. 19, 2.1, 2.2., and 2.4, all of which hold another dagger). The last shows a three-tiered dagger. The topmost deity is four-armed and holds instruments for staking and hammer-ing, the central deity holds a single hammer, and the third face above the blade is therianthropic. On the rite of staking (ltii4NZviJhjf1), see VA VighnaltilanaviJhi SP f. I]V-I8r. This rite is often associated with the ten ltrodhardjas. A vivid example is a Hevajra rite described by Davidson (1992.: u6), in which the creation of the cir-cle of protection is followed by the visualization of a \"rimless wheel with blade-like spokes in the ten directions\" that are occupied by the ten ltroJJNa. The meditator as U~J]ipcak.ravartin, with retinue, sits in the center, summons the demonic forces with rays, and causes them to fill the area between the sharp spokes of the wheel. He then sees the wheel revolving, chopping the vighnas into pieces, burning them with fire, and dispersing them by wind. Their \"men-tal principles\" are sent to the realm of Alqobhya with the recitation of the appropriate mantra, and the wheel mdts into space. 306 More specifically, in GSSs, the wells are created from \"the lengthy subde res-onance of the syllable when it is recited\" (Kl8vl): JaiaJiggatavip111lvnu/ttm dniya dirghan44occ4ritahii'!'ltliran#pannqu prdlt4rabdhyqu Sllmi~ JigviJigm tu ltupt_su prawlytL The instruction to dig the wdls \"near\" the vajra walls is unclear to me and is not clarified by the Tibetan texts, which state that the wells appear \"outside\" the wall or fence.

Without emendation, the text translates: \"For him it is said (iti) other protection is like emptiness .... \" The function of iti (rak!eti) is not entirely clear. Perhaps it indicates a citation, for example, from Liiyipada's HA. 3II In the GSS collection, only two sadhanas apart from the Vajravdrdhi Sddhana elaborate upon the cremation grounds: the Trayodafdtmikavajrarjdkinisddhana (GSS16) and the \"skeleton arch\" practice of Dhyayipada (GSS34). These, and other sources for the cremation grounds, are discussed below in n. 312.

The ere-"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"NOTE TO PAGE 137 449 marion-ground culture pervades the HT, but without mention of the eight cremation grounds as such. For example, in its proto-sadhana (HT1.j.4), the yogin is to seat himself inside the vajra zone on a corpse; later in the chapter, the text states that the lord plays in the cremation ground surrounded by his eight yoginis (HTI.j.l6ab): lmllkiM lrrit/4~ 1llltho !!Ayogini[bhi/1} pra\"ffllb. The text later finds a convenient etymology (niruhi/J) of the word im4l4na from the verbal root \"to expire· (HT1.j.I6cd): lvasatity aNZyi yulttyl lmtll4n~ty abhiJhiya~. The locus clllSsicus for the eight cremation grounds in the Saf!lvara tradition is the SUT (ch. 17, vv. 36-45), and it is to this passage that Umipatidcva's verses arc related. The scripture describes the types of inhabitants by group (eight named cremation grounds, eight trees, eight protectors, etc.). Umipatidcva rearranges this grouping slighdy and divides the cardinal cre-mation grounds {vv. 7o-72) and intermediate cremation grounds (vv. 73-76). The sur ends with a more generalized description of the terrifying contents of the cremation grounds, and this seems to be the basis for a similar account in the ADUT (ch. 9· p. 293)/ VtirahyabhyuJa]lltantra (vv. 103-9) that men-tions colors, animals, corpses, etc., but no individual features or names. An important exegetical work from the Saf!lvara corpus is the Sm414114Wihi by Liiyipada (in Finot 1934 and Meisezahl 1980). This text allots two verses to each feature {but gives the douds separately, v. 18ff.), and like the SUT ends with a general description of the cremation grounds. The order of the inter-mediate cremation grounds in this text is suspect (southwest, northwest, and omitting northwest and nonhcast). Meisczahl (1980) discusses two Tibetan translations of Cakrasaf!lvara exegetical texts in the Tibetan canon: the AJbhutaim414111llm,luira (a subcommentary in the Cakrasaf!lvara collection in bKa' 'gyur. Toh 413, reported in Meisczahl op. cit.: 18-2.1); and the Smai4nti-l'\"!'luiratantra (fob 402, reported in Meisczahl op. cit.: 21-2.2). These seem to be rdated to Liiyipada's SmaitiNZviJhi since they have many features in com-mon (including the same imprecision in the intermediate directions). In the GSS collection, the TrayoJa/lltmiltavajratf41tinisllJha114 (GSS16, K76v5-77r) merely lists the direction and name of each cremation ground (drawing initially on SUT ch. 17 vv. 36cd-37ab). The \"skeleton arch\" prac-tice ofDhyayipada (GSS34) gives a brief description of them as the setting for the skeleton arch (GSS34. Kn2.r1) and then supplies a more detailed account as the cremation grounds arc internalized by the yogin (Kn3r5) and used as the basis for a series of equations with his psychophysical being, in an internalized, cremation-ground version of the yogic body DW}4a}a (n. 477 with endnote table vi). Secondary materials on the eight cremation grounds arc limited, and not consistent (which reflects the unstudied diversity of the primary sources). Mcisczahl (op. cit.) examines the contents of cremation grounds and illustrates them with plates, but this is a short and preliminary study (with several mis-"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"450 NOTES TO PAGES 137-138 takes) that concentrates on a small number of Samvara-bascd teXts (SliT, the AJbhutalm4ilin4/a1f1/tara, S1Nli4Nila'f'lt4ratantr~. and Liiyipada' s S1Nll4na-viJhi). Tsuda (1974: 292, nn. 1-3) mentions a description of the cremation grounds in the 1Aghutantrapi!'f!arth4viVIlra!fll, in works by T song kha pa, and in a sadhana by Bu ston. Ka1ff (1979: 2.4) discusses the relevance ofPali sources describing meditations on decaying corpses. K. Gyatso (1999: 1~23) gives an account of the meditation, also drawing upon Tsong kha pa and dGc lugs sources. Their symbolism is discussed by L. Chandra (Preface to Dawa Samdup 1919: 2.8-32., citing the VajrapriUiifJIZ!ippa!'i of Suratavajra). I draw these primary and secondary materials together in the annotations to table 14. 313 For birds and animals, sec SliT ch. 17, vv. 42-.~ub; ADliT ch. 9· p. 293; SmailinaviJhiv. 2.5; Tsuda (SliT p. 293) gives references to them in Bu ston's Mar.ufalaviJhi. For descriptions of the corpses, sec SliT ch. 17, vv. 43c-44b, ADliT ch. 9, SmailinaviJhi v. 2.6, and Smailinlila'f'ltlirat4ntra reponed in Meisczahl (1980: 2.2). For supernatural beings, sec SliT vv. 44-45 and the SmailinaviJhi, which describes yoginis with chopper and skull bowl, drums, and food (v. 17) and eight siddhas (v. 2.8). Some features of the cremation grounds that arc not included in the SaJ!lvara texts arc also shown in table 14. Of these, only the SmailinaviJhi ( v. 18) mentions that eight caii]IIS (unnamed) adorn the cremation grounds; Meisczahl (op. cit.: s6) suggests these are drawn from the tradition of eight holy sites of the Buddha's life. The additional fca-twes arc mentioned by Mciscuhl in his annotations to planchc 1 (Ma'JI/tda of Chinnamu!V/Il-Vajravlirtihi picture no. 4072., Rijksmuscum voor Volkcnkundc, Leyden, Netherlands); he names the /q~trapli/a, the cllity4s. and the mountains individually, but his textual sources for so doing are unclear (dscwhere, he mentions that Bu ston supplies a list of ten caii]IIS. ibiJ.: 2.1). K. Gyarso's account (op.dt.) also mentions the additional features, such as a stiipa (unnamed) on the top of the mountain (named). 314 The Sanskrit text ofGSS34 is very uncenain (sec the appendix), and I have not even attempted to make full emendations here.

Further tex· tual research upon this subject is needed, drawing on Tibetan authors such as Bu ston and T song kha pa, against a study of the anistic representations. The cremation grounds do not just appear in tangkas in the Cakrasalpvara tradition; there arc many ofHcruka-ba.scd r:naJ.l4ala.s. including those of the Hevajra tra-dition (e.g., r:naJ.l4ala.s ofHevajra, Nairarma. Buddhakapala, and Vajrahiirpkara"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 138-146 451 in Tibetan Painted Mandalas, Rossi and Rossi 1993). Some show the cremation grounds beyond the felly of the circle of protection and some within it. I see no basis from artistic works for Kelsang Gyatso's remark (1997: 89) that the crema-tion grounds are inside the circle of protection principally in Vajravarahi practices. 316 See Abhidharmakofabhiifya ch. 3, vv. 53b-56 for the four continents (includ-ing Jambudvipa) extending in the cardinal directions. Each continent is flanked by two smaller continents. There are therefore twelve continents, but only eight cremation grounds. For the mountains, see ADK/B ch. 3, vv. 48b-49c; for the lakes, ADK/B ch. 3, vv. 51c-52c. There are seven lakes (liter-ally \"cools\": sitiis) that separate the mountain ranges, plus the great ocean itself beyond. The interpretation of sita is debatable, however (see Pruden, nn. 380-82). The Abhidharmic cosmology is discussed and helpfully illustrated by Brauen (1997: 18-21). 317 A summary of How Heruka Was Born (dPal he ru ka'i byung tshul, SK III.298.4.2-300.2.6) by Davidson (1991: 205ff.). 318 Sanderson (1994 n. 35) demonstrates that the use of the standard seed-syllables (ya1J'l ra1J'l va1J'l la1'f'l) in the Buddhist sadhanas corresponds to that of the Vaig1ava and Saiva tantric traditions, and he proposes that these, and the tra-dition of relating each to a symbol, are in origin brahmanical (on which see also Heilijgers-Seelen 1994: 20). 319 GSS5 (Sed p. 129\\ Kr7V3): tatab piirvapra1Jidhanavedhavafat fiinyatiisamadher vyutthaya svacittam evopary upari ya1J'lra1J'lVa1'f'lla1J'lpari1Jatadhanustriko1Javartu-lacaturasrakaranilaraktafvetapitavar7Jacalatpatakankakofidvayajvaliinkaghatank a<trifiikavajranka>mg2k01Jacatuf!ayam. vayuvahnivaru7Jakfitima1Jt/alasvabha-Va1J'l vicintya tadupari su1J'lktirasamudbhava1J'l caturasram aftasrnga1J'l piirva-dakfi1Japafcimottaraparfvefu riipyavairjiiryasphafikasuvar1Jamaya1J'l sumeru1J'l dhyatva • af!af.rnga1J'l piirva] em. ~tafrngo piirvo K. Cf. SUTch. 13, vv. 9-12; HA (f. 3v); and sadhanas showing various elaborations to the process, e.g., the red fire element may have the syllable ra-inscribed in each corner, e.g., SMno (p. 226): tato ra1J'lktire7Jtigneya1J'l triko1Ja1J'l raktako1Je!u rephankam (cf. SM95, SM97); the elements may have the seed-syllable and the emblem upon them (as in Kumaracandra's commentary on the KYT papala 17 (p. 124); Varahya-bhyudayatantra vv. 35-40; etc. 320 Changes to the Abhidharmic model can be observed as early as the yogatantra corpus in the Vairocana sadhana of the Sarvadurgatiparifodhana (p. 160), which includes the substrate of emptiness (in the form of the emptiness meditations) and the fire element. It also describes the water element as \"the great ocean\" (mahodadhib), and generates the ma!).<j.ala of gold above that from the syllable ka1J'l. The changes in the yoginitantras accord with the cosmic systems described in Saiva and Vai~I).ava tantric traditions and may evince their influence (Sander-son, op.cit.). Isaacson (1998: personal communication) notes that other mod-els were also in use, for example, the Buddhist tantric Catu~pi~ha tradition uses quite different syllables: JU1J'l kfU1J'l SU1J'l hu1J'l. Both cosmological systems are also beautifully illustrated in line drawings by"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"452 NOTES TO PAGES 146-147 Beer (1999: plate 61 with pp. 108-9), and in computer-generated illustrations in Brauen's exposition of the cosmos (1994: 5o-54 and 1997: 19-20, figs. 5 and 8). I do not attempt to reproduce the cylindrical shape of the elements here in fig. 25, as the dimensions are not even possible to reproduce with computer drawings. For example, although the height of the elements is given in the Abhidharmakofa, the circumference of the wind element is said to be \"immeas-urable,\" and space is infinite; Mount Meru also dives beneath the gold/earth to a given depth, and Brauen (ibid.) shows how the mountain is formed dif-ferently in the different systems. There are also numerous heavens above Meru within the kiimadhiitu, the riipadhiitu (culminating in the Akanigha heaven), and the iirupyadhiitu. 321 Sadhanas that directly follow the emptiness meditation with visualization of the cosmos must postpone installing the circle of protection until after the cosmos has been set in place. This differs from the method in the Vajraviiriihi Siidhana, in which the emtpiness meditations lead on directly to the circle of protection, and in which the cosmos-whether the cremation grounds as in v. 16a or the traditional cosmos as in v. 35-is visualized inside the circle of protection. Examples of texts that place the visualization of the cosmos immediately after the emptiness meditations (and therefore before the circle of protection has been generated) include Sarvadurgatiparifodhanatantra (p. 16o); SUTch. 13, vv. 8-9; HA (f. 3r); GSS5 (Sed p. 129\\ Kqv3); GSS3 (Kr2r5); and GSS12 (K71n). The difference is more apparent than real, since in these cases, the cir-cle of protection presumably encompasses the visualized cosmos, or as it says in GSS3, it is visualized \"on top\" (GSS3 Kr2r6: taduparz), perhaps \"superim-posed\"? The dharmodayii and temple palace are then visualized within the cir-cle of protection, on top of Mount Meru. 322 E.g., GSS3, GSSn, cf.

In tantric visualizations, the various aspects of the temple palace also become the subject of purifying equations. The con-nection with the yogatantra corpus may explain the common vifuddhi of the temple palace with the body ofVairocana, e.g., GSS5 (Sed p. 13016, Kr9n-2): -savidyiivairocaniitmaka'f!l kutiigiira'f!l ... <bhiivayet>; Hevajrasekaprakriyii ( vairo-canafuddhyii kutiigiira'f!l ... ); SMno (p. 227): parifuddhabuddhakfetra'f[l sa'f!lkfepa-riipa'f!l mahiimokfapura'f!l vairocanasvabhiiva'f!l niiniiratnamaya'f[l kutiigiiram ... , etc. Studies have shown that the traditional Indian temple, based on the intri-cately conceived viistupurufama7Jrfala, is equated with both the cosmos and the"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 147-149 453 body (Snodgrass 1985: 104-17). For a brief resume of work on this topic, sec Braucn (1997: 73-74). 32.5 Earlier sidha.nas describe the generation of the temple palace upon a lorus (e.g., SM12.3 p. 2.55), but later texts add the detail that upon the pcricarp is an altar-like foundation composed of a double vajra, e.g., SUT (ch. 13, v. 13); HA (f. 3v); Bhramttluzran41114 HnNljras4Jh11114 (eel. Isaacson 1997); SM97 (p. 136); SMuo (p. 2.27); NYA (p. 12.); cf. K. Gyatso (1997: 86, 93). This is illustrated artistically in the sculpted Sumeru Temple in Chengde Uehol, China), in Braucn (1997: 74 fig. so). 32.6 The manner in which the dcvarion of the temple is depicted within the two-dimensional m~Qa1a is discussed by Brauen and illustrated with a helpful series of explanatory models (1997 fig. 47 and plates 15-2.1). 32.7 Another \"transitional .. GSS sadhana is the Trayotildatmiluzvajra44/tinisd4h4M (GSS16), wruch fuses the tradition of the temple palace with the setting of the eight cremation grounds; it is the only GSS sidhana to locate the self-generation within the eight cremation grounds and also to endow the goddess with a palace (vimli111lm) within those cremation grounds. The setting of the temple palace within the cremation grounds is familiar from other tantric systems, and is that represented in all artistic representations of m~Qalas within the cre-mation grounds.

This is taught in the GST (ch. 12, v. 66a; ch. 18, v. 137) as part of the fourfold series seva, etc., mentioned on page 25 (GST ch. 12, v. 6off.; ch. r8, v. 136ff.).

Beyer (1978: 109-10) describes its correlation in a Tibetan tra-dition with the process of rebirth. In the sixfold arrangement (of six \"gods\"), the first \"god\" (tattvadevata) represents meditations on the nature of the \"self'; the second (fabdadevata) is \"the god as sound,\" i.e., the mantric syllable resounding above the moon disk; the third (akfaradevatd) is the mind as the moon disk with the mantra written in gold around it; the fourth (riipadevata) is the rays issuing from those letters to benefit the world and retracting once again into the deity's body; the fifth (mudradevata) is the armoring of the deity's body; the sixth (nimittadevata) is the meditation on the form of the deity to fortify the aha1[Zkdra. The six gods are discussed by mKhas grub rje (ch. 4: 159-63), who correlates them with the five awakenings (ibid.: 163, with n. 16; cf. ch. r: 29), and also by Tsong kha pa (1987: 104-9), with discussion by H. H. Tenzin Gyatso (ibid.: pp. 21-24). This is also summarized by Brauen (1997: 64-65). mKhas grub rje states that \"the method of contemplating the six gods\" is referred to by the yogatantra commentator, Buddhaguhya, cit-ing Kriyatantra texts (ch. 4: r65).

Sanderson 1994: n. 57) describes a fourfold ennumeration of the bliss of the seed, in which the first three types of bliss encompass the third awakening. and the final bliss describes the fourth awakening: (I) the bliss of the seed placed (directly) upon the sun disk (prayogasultlutm), (1) the bliss of the emblem (cihnam) that has arisen from the seed (m~ham), (3) the bliss of the seed inside the cihna (paricc'\"elasulth~tm), and (4) the bliss of the innumerable yoginis that emanate and retract [into that seed through the agency of rays] (p~tr4rthasulthllm).

The first generation is of the deities' \"causal\" form (or hnuvajrllllhara); then the second generation gives rise to the \"resultant\" forms (phalavajradhara). The causal deities are visualized in sexual intercourse, during which the seed is implanted in the womb of the female deity via the male's penis, as in the Bhramah4ra111lma HnNZjraslilihana (Isaac-son 1997: s): tasytinantlina tisyma dvihof1lttiravi44rbhitam I jva/ad bijadVIIJil'!' rtigtit paJ1111inta/J praviilul Jrawt, upon which Isaacson (ibid: 2.7) writes: \"RamakaraSanti is perhaps deliberately slighdy obscure here; it must be under-stood that the sdtJhalta visualizes himself in the form of the seed syllables ll'!' and ~ preceded and followed by hop, and that he then enten into the mouth of the Hevajra generated in the paiictiltdrtibhisa'!'botihi above and passes through the central channel of the deity's body and via his penis into the womb ofNairatmya, where the seed syllables melt to form a single white drop.\" The drop produced from the great bliss must then be aroused with song (see Beyer for a discussion based primarily on T song kha pa' s sNgags rim chm po, 1978 pp. IIJ, 12.6-2.7, and Wayman 1990: 2.11-17.) 348 On the three bodies in relation to the self-generation, see Sanderson (1994: n. 57) citing, for example, the Yoginisa'!fCdranibanJha: \"Having a nirmli!'4 [body] means the embodiment of the deity as the Emanation-Body which pulsates for the benefit of living beings ... hence, because it is being enjoyed by the deities in the temple palace through their enjoyment of Truth, it is called the Enjoyment-Body.\" (f. 4f1}: ••. nairmli'.'iltam iti jagatlartha'!' prati sphara1JilSII'!'-h4ra1}4tmalta'fl tinNzt/Ukha'fl nirmd!\"llttiyasvabhdva'!' jNitv~ti i~I'IP· .. ata n~a dharmasa,bhogadvti\"'.\"' ltufllgtirasthitatkvatlibhib sa,.bhujyamtinatvtit Sll'fl-bhop/t4ya ity ucyau; also, \"The Body of Transformation in the state of radiat-ing the deities is like the state of begetting sons and so on\" (Amndyamlliijari cited Beyer 1978: 12.6).

Rhie and Thurman (1991: 261) refer to three Vajra4akini forms, which are said to have been revealed to Indrabhuti, Maitripa. and Naropa. These three masters are all associated with separate lin-eages in the Tibetan tantric tradition, according to an anlaysis of nine S~vara schools by Tibetan commentator Ngag dbang rigs 'dzin rnam rgyal rdo rje. namely the three main lineages ofLuyipada, Ghatnapada, and ~r;tall<inhapa. plus the lesser-known methods of Prabhutacandra, Kambala, Nagarjuna, lndrabhuti, Maitripada, and Trinetra (L. Chandra in Dawa-Samdup 1919: 9). A sadhana of this form ofVajravirahi is found in the Rin 'byung brgya rtsa, in which she is called \"Naco's Qakini\" (Na ro mltha 'spyoti) (WilJson and Brauen 2000: 258). She is depicted twice in the Mongolian icons following this text (IWS/T 77, LC 587 and IWS/T 87, LC 597). The Tibetan sadhana (ibid.) dif-fers from our Sanskrit description in the following ways: Naro-Qakini holds in her right hand either a \"knife marked with a vajra, or a t;lamaru dangling from a vajra.\" Her skull staff may be held either \"in her left armpit\" (as IWSIT 87, LC 597), or \"on the shoulder\" (as IWS/T 77, LC 587). Her black hair is adorned with \"five sons of naga-trce flowers,\" and her garland is of dried skulls; she wears only five signs of observance. The mantra given is: 07JI O'JI O'JI saroa-buddhatjliltin~y~. vajravli'!J!\"lniJ~. vajravairocaniy~. hu'!' hu'!' hu7!' pha! pha! phaf svaha (ibid.: 213). 353 Sanderson (1998: personal communication) suggests that this may refer to the brilliant red of the stigmas of the saffron crocus before they have been removed from the flower and dried. 354 E.g ..

Torzsok 1999. 358 Seep. 72. This distinction seems to have been blurred by the traditions trans-mitted into Tibet (and subsequently by secondary sources). In the Textual Note to the corruption in verse 20, it is noted that, according to the Tibetan translation, the goddess holds a \"chopper shaped like a leaf.\" The Tibetan sadhana ofNaro-Qakini (Willson and Brauen 2000: 258) notes that she holds in her right hand either a \"knife marked with a vajra, or a <;lamaru dangling from a vajra.\" 359 GSS5 (Sed p. 1319-12, KI9v2): vajravdriihi'f!l ... samarasibhiitapaficajfidnavifud-dhydru1J.avajradhard1J2; SM218 (p. 428): ... aru1J.apaficasucikavajra'f!l dhyatvd. In contrast, Luyipada prescribes a vajra with a single point (GSS2 Kiu4): dak!ilJ.e ekafiikavajram. In sadhanas of the tantric goddess Marici, both types of vajra are prescribed, illustrating that they are classed as different attributes, e.g., SM138 (vajram); SM143 (ekasiicivajram); SM134 (both vajra and siici); SM140 (both vifvavajram and ekasiicivajram). Snodgrass (1985: 175 fig. 106) shows examples of vajras with one, two, three, four, five, and nine prongs, and dis-cusses the vajra as a multivalent symbol, (ibid.: 174). Beer (1999: 232-43, with plates 108-12) illustrates iconographical differences and discusses their sym-bolism.

The place of Bhairava and the Bhairava tantras within Saivism is discussed on pp. 37-38. Sanderson (1998: personal commu-nication) points out that the Buddhist iconography does not represent Bhairava as a supreme deity, for example, with five faces and with ten or eighteen arms {e.g., Svacchandabhairava in the Svacchandatantra 2.88c-94b; Bhairava in Netratantra 10.1-6b).

Sometimes, however, Vajravarahi subdues only a single, unnamed corpse representing ignorance (e.g., plates I and 3 and Khara Khoto Vajravarahi in Sacrtd.AnofTiiHt, plate 93 and Piotrovsky 1993, plate 22). 390 A useful discussion of the scholarly work has been made by Mayer h996: 104-48, 1998), much of it based on research by Sanderson (1988, 1991, 1993). Sec also Stein (1995 based on 1971-n), Kalff (1979), Iyanaga (1985), Snellgrove (1987: IJ4-41• 152ff.), and Davidson (1991). 391 Mayer (1996: 109ff.) discusses the subject in some detail, drawing on A Hilte-bcitel1989, W. Doniger O'Fbherty 1975, and others. 392 This is followed by the conversion of the gods of the three worlds, Naray~a (= V1f~u), Sanatkumara (= Skandha), Brahma, and Indra, and the deities of intermediate space, space, earth, and hdl, all of whom receive new names. The lesser evils (JU!~· qakinis, illnesses, hells, and calamities) arc convened or thrown into the sea, while for humans, the m~4ab of victory over the three worlds (triloltavija)ll\"\"'!\"/ala) is laid out. 393 Davidson's highly usd'ul anidc h991), traces the myth from the eighth-century yogatantra sowces, through into fifteenth-century Tibetan materials. He amus-ingly translates a portion of the SITS and describes the similar account in the eighth-century Trllilo/tyilvijaytt~rllja and Vajrakltharamahayogatllntra. He then shows how the myth takes a more violent rum in the Gzntiraguhya-mll!Jitilaltam~~hlitantrarlija and in the GuhyagarbhlltllttrHiviniicllJil ( = Guhya-garbhatantrarGuhyakoilltantra). Another eighth-century text that shares the theme of subjugation is the Sarv4bw1Jhasam4yogat!4ftinij1114sa'!'VIlra (discussed by Sanderson 1995). Its pantheon is similar to that in the *Guhyagarbhal Guhya/tola. and it also represents Heruka subduing the Brahmanical gods and taking their wives as his consorts. 394 Sanskrit originals dealing with the CakrasaJ!lvara-based myth arc scant. Stein (Annuairc 1973: 468) has noted the existence in the Tibetan canon of transla-tions of (unspecified) Sanskrit commentaries by lndrabhuti, Vajra, and Nampa, but as yet no study has been made of this material (these are listed with refer-ences by Mayer 1996: n8 n. 12). Davidson (1991: n. 14) notes that Niropa's ver-sion of the myth is not cited by other Tibetan cxcgttes, so that, in Tibet at least, its influence was \"less than complete.• Versions of the subjugation myth also appear in indigenous Tibetan texts. The Tibetan scholar Bu ston (1291-1361)"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 163-164 deals with it in som~ length in his commentary to th~ CaltrllSil'!IWZTIZtllntriZ (Kalff 1979: 67ffl, admittedly relying on Sanskrit authors, including Bhava-bhana. A version of th~ myth (How Hm4/uz Was Born) was also written by the late twdfch-c~ntury scholar Grags pa rgyal mrshan (1167-12.16), a summary of which is given by Davidson (1991: 2.04). Davidson (ibid.: 2.09ff.) also discusses two indigenow Ti~an texts that au concerned with th~ myth from the Lam 'bras tradition. 395 A wry lampoon upon the Buddhist approach-and perhaps an admission of its success appears in a thirteenth-century Saiva text, th~ H~tr«llritlldnllima'.'i of Jayadratha. Sanderson (1994, 1995) describes how, in this account of th~ Puril}ic myth, Jayadratha attributes a new ploy to the gods in their batd~ against th~ demons. As wual, th~ demons have attain~d near-invincibility because of th~ir devotion to Siva, and so the teacher of the gods, Bfhaspati, d~­~rly sets about undermining their adherence to Saivism, the very source of their power (v. 13.74C-83): \"I shall propagate the following system and call it Baud-dha [Buddhist]-truthfully enough, since it will be no more than the inven-tion of my intell«t {buJJhi]. In it the famow Buddha will be represented as master over the [Hindu] gods. In his visualizations ~en ow great cause deities, Brahmi, Vi~J)U, Rudra, i5vara, SadaSiva, and Bhairava, will be ponrayed as his parasol bcaurs, and the Buddhist idols will be shown standing on the heads of Gar:'apati and other high Saiva deities. When the demons get to know of these falsely conceived icons, they will undoubtedly fall into the ddwion of believ-ing that these deities really arc superior to Siva.\" Brhaspati docs not stop here but devises the cunning scheme of culling mantras from Saiva tantras, and ~en lifting passages out ofSaiva scriptures with which to \"propagate a system of [Buddhist] tantric ritual.,. He would also attack the demons on the meta-physical front: \"My liberation will be a 'voidness' calculated to undermine their faith in their Saiva rituals ... and I shall deny the existence of the Supreme Lord by arguing that there is no self.\" In this way Brhaspati plots the demons' destruction through their conversion to Buddhism. Perhaps an even more direct acknowledgement of the success of the Buddhist methods appears else-where in the same text, when the Saivas respond in kind with the terrible form of Kili \"Destroyer of the Buddhas· (Sug~ri!fi}. whose ornaments arc created from the dismembered pans of Buddhist deities (cited Sanderson 1994 n. 72. from JIIJIUir1ZthllJil1NliiZ. !\"!U 2. 2.1.9-14). 396 The scriptural source for Umapatidcva may be the Strr, which concludes the generation of Sarpvara's thinccnfold Mal)4aia in ch. 13 with \"two armorings\" (referring to Cakra.sarpvara and Vajravarahi in union) and the subsequent infu-sion of the knowledge circle, (v. 34): ~ UVIZCIZiiVIZJil'!l jfidtvti jli41111C1Zitr1Zm vibhawtyn.

Gyatso 1999: 144-45). It is the variously colored light rays emitted by the syllables and fanning out through the body (though described in these sources in slighdy different ways) that actually create the armor. These Tibetan sources agree that \"mouth\" is here equivalent to the throat area, in one case (Dhargycy op. dt.) acknowledging the discrepancy of the oral tradition: \"Now, at the throat (although the text says 'mouth') .... \" They also agree that the final armoring inion \"all the limbs\" refers to the \"eight great joints,\" i.e., shoulders, wrists, hips, and ankles. However, oral instructions in other Tibetan traditions vary considerably in this matter (Sobisch 2.001: per-sonal communication). 398 The marginal insertion claims that the five armor goddesses also hold a bell in their left hands; this seems to be an error.

In Cakrasa.qwara sources, there is also a set of six male mantra gods, which are placed as armor on the Heruka god prior to the armoring of his consort with the female mantra gods, a process said to unify the couple, e.g., ADUT ch. 14 (p. 321): kavacadvayarrz tato nyastvii ekarasasvabhiivatab. The male syllables are given in the Vajraviiriihisiidhana during the worship in the hand (showing themselves much less stable than those for the female deity). They are also illustrated in the Mongolian icons (LC 566-71, IWS/T 56-61) following the Tibetan text (Willson and Brauen 2000: 252). 400 Willson and Brauen 2000: 252-53. Variants in the seed syllables in the Tibetan text are: harrz yorrz (Yamini) and hurrz hurrz (Sarp.trasini).

(an early equivalent of the five awakenings).ln the SMs6 Arapaca1111-Maiijuiris4Jha\"\" (pp. 117-18) there is still no series of awakenings, but Maiiju5ri arises having \"the knowledge essence of all tathagatas\" (sa1Vflllllh4gatajfill1111Svariipa) and with the ego of the pledge being (SIDNIJtlSIIttwlluz'fllttirawin). Then ll'fl in the heart gives rise to the generation of Arapacana at the heart, with a syllable at his heart also, surrounded by deities with sylbbles of his mantra at their hearts; rays emitted from the whirling cakra in the heart then destroy ignorance. A similar practice in SMs8 (p. 122) specifically mentions the jfi4NU4ttvll (p. 122): tato NiJ41uzhrtlbiJ4vinirgllld,Sv-illtr!ftljli41IIIS4ltrlmll sahailtatll'fl ca ca~mz, calighra'!' bhramn.

Traces of the earlier SAmllJII terminology survive in the ADUT, e.g .• in ch. 14 (p. 317; cf. ch. 19, p. 353), in which Heruka is to have at his heart the jnlinllSIImaya, a replica of the main deity, with the same color and arms.

The attendance of women singing and dancing at a bathing ceremony is, of course, a classical Indian motif, e.g., in the KumaraSilmbhava (ch. 7.1ocd), where women bathe Umi with water poured out from golden pots to the accompaniment of musical instruments. 416 E.g., Advayavajra's Saptd/qarasdtihana SM251 (p. 493).

See the parallel account in the Abhisamayamaftjari cited inn. 417. Cf. SM218 (p. 429). 419 The use of this mantra referring to \"all tathagatas\" in Umapatideva's text is somewhat incongruous, as he deals with the consecration of the solo deity, Vajravarahi, presided over by Vairocana. It makes more sense when it appears in the Abhisamayamaftjari (cited n. 417) in which the water of consecration is understood to produce all five tathagatas as the seal; these are then allocated as presiding buddhas to the goddesses in different parts of the mal).4ala. 420 On the purificatory function of the consecrations, Dr. Isaacson (1996b) notes that in the VA, Abhayakaragupta states that the five consecrations (vidyabhi-fekas) plus the \"Garland Consecration as the sixth\" counteract ignorance (VA B f. 73r): ete miilodakadayab far/ abhifekii avidyavipakfayogyatiipiidaniid vidyabhifeka ucyate; see also YRM on HT1.4 (p. 115): abhifeko jftiiniimbubhib saviisanasarviivara!lakfiilaniirtham. Elsewhere the consecration liquid is imag-ined transforming into the buddhas of hate, slander, envy, craving, ignorance (and the dharmadhatu for the sixth), which thereby purify those negativities, e.g., SM251 (p. 493), mKhas grub rje (p. 221, with Wayman's notes). Professor Sanderson (1994 n. 96) provides a full discussion of these correspondences. 421 Published overviews of the topic in English include Kvaerne 1975, Lessing and Wayman 1978, Snellgrove 1987: 231-77 (also 1959 vol. r: 95, n. 1), and Benter (1996: 240-61) on the rites of initiation, both lower and higher, within tantric rites of consecrating images, etc. The fivefold series of lower consecrations is also termed the vase consecra-tion (kalafabhifekab) after the vessel bestowing the empowerment, or the knowledge consecration (vidyabhifekab), either because of its association with wisdom (vidyii) or after the female agents of consecration, vidyiis, in our texts (mKhas grub rje, chapter 9, comments on both interpretations). The five con-secrations of this set generally comprise: the water consecration ( udakabhife-kab), the head jewel consecration (mukupiibhifekab), the vajra consecration (vajrabhifekab), the bell consecration (gha!lfiibhifekab), and the name conse-cration (niimiibhifekab). However, research by Dr. Isaacson (1996b) has shown the classification of the consecrations to be a highly complex matter, with dif-ferent series of consecrations listed according the different tantric systems and to the individual scholars attempting to clarify the varying accounts. For exam-ple, Isaacson shows that not only was opinion divided over the exact contents of the lower consecrations just listed, bur a certain group of influential exegetes actually included the teacher consecration (iiciiryabhifekab) within them (for example Abhayakaragupta, who gives an account of the various systems in his VA [ms. \"B\" f. 8rv]; Kuladatta, as implied in his Kriyiisa'f!lgrahapaftjikiiCam-bridge [f. w6v]; Kumaracandra in his Ratniivalipaftjika to the KYf [Sed p."},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"474 NOTES TO PAGES 170-171 roo]; the unknown author of the Hevajrasekaprakriyd; and Advayavajra in his Advayavajrasarrzgraha [pp. 36-38; also cited by Snellgrove 1987= 229]). The vase consecration and teacher consecration together are sometimes referred to sim-ply as the teacher consecration (dcdryabhifeka~), or as the irreversible conse-cration (avaivarytabhifeka~) since they operate as a prerequisite to the consecration of a guru (Snellgrove 1987= 231). The locus classicus for the vase consecration is the Uttaratantra portion of the GS (ch. 18, v. n3), which lists the consecrations as vase (kalafa0), secret (guhya0), wisdom (prajfid0), and \"fourth\" (caturtha0) (which was purely verbal in nature, Isaacson op. cit.). Similarly in the Hevajra tradition (HT2.3.10), the main con-secrations are listed as teacher, secret, wisdom, and \"fourth.\" Dharmakirti explains the first of these (the vase or teacher consecration) as follows (Snell-grove's translation HT vol. I 1959: 95, n. 1): \"The first is called Jar consecration (kalafabhifeka) or the Master's consecra-tion (dcdryabhi!eka).lt is called a baptism because impurity is washed away, that is to say that the impurity of the body is washed away. It is called the conse-cration (or baptism) of the jar, because it is characterised by (the use of) a jar, and the consecration of the Master because it is far removed from evil and wickedness. It is also called the consecration of knowledge [vidyabhifeka} because it overthrows ignorance and arouses an awareness of the five spheres of knowledge (paficavidyajfidna). \" 422 E.g., SM251 (p. 493): abhi1ekam anundthayet bhagavanta~ sarvatathdgatd abhifekarrz dadantu me iti; cf. HT1.4, Hevajrasekaprakriyd, etc. The consecra-tion verse supplied by Umapatideva (v. 27i) would normally provide the \"reply\" to the request. 423 Direct references to the utpattikrama in the GSS are found in GSS6 (K39r5): utpattikramayogendtmabhavarrz vibhavayet and GSS23 (K87n): lokefvare~Ja bhagavatoddif!a utpattikramasadhana<~>. The six arigas are treated in some depth in the final commentarial-style work of the GSS, the I;Jakiniguhyasamaya-siidhana GSS46 (Kr43v ff.). They are: (r) withdrawal [of the senses] (pratyahdra~), (2) dhyana-meditation, (3) breath-control (prd~Jdydma~), (4) concentration of the mind (joined with retention of the breath) (dhara~Jd), (5) recollection (anusm_rti~), and (6) samadhi-meditation. Apart from their early exposition in the $at;larigayoga-ndma (Peking Tibetan Tripi~aka vol. 85), they are widely expounded in Sanskrit and Tibetan texts, e.g., in yogottara works such as the PU commentary to the Guhyasamdjatantra (PU p. n6ff. on GST ch. 12, vv. 6o-64), in which Candrakirti cites and comments on the six yogas as given in the \"Uttaratantra\"portion GST ch. 18, v. 137 and vv. 14o-54 (also edited and translated by Wayman 1977= 38-50). Kalacakra texts dealing with the system include Naropa's Sekoddefatika from the Sekoddefa portion of the Kdlacakra-tantra (see Orofino 1994), the main commentary on the root tantra, the Vimala-prabhafikd by Pul).<;iarika, and the Gu~Jdbhara~Ji nama $at;farigayoga{ippa1Ji by Ravisrijfi.ana (Sferra 2ooo).

The thirteen-syllabled heart mantra appears for the same two-armed, warrior-stance manifestation of Vajravirahi (GSSs). for urJhvaplilia Vajravarahi (GSSn), and for the six-armed maJ]4aia leader (GSS16). Different manifestations ofVajrayogini are ascribed different mantras (see ch. 2.). Manuscripts reveal considerable numbers of variants in the mantras. In par-ticular, the length of the vowel hu'f'/hu'!' varies. While this may be a matter of orthography, the two syllables are distinct, and Umapatidcva himself com-ments upon this in a mantra that combines both (sec §34). The long syllable (hu,) is the seed-syllable of the tathagata ~bhya and thence of the various Herukas of which he is the family lord. In most Vajravir:ihi mantras in the GSS, the syllable is short (hu'fl). Another common variant is the form of the name clement. Following the brahmanicaJ model, the dative form (-~) is the norm, as the cxmction of the manm (m~~ntrot/Jh4ral_,) described in GSS1-GSS2. confirms. However, our manuscripts also transcribe the name clement as a vocative (-i) and, probably through a corruption of the vocative. as a nom-inative (-i}.

Noon is the eighth or ninth chu tshod (approx. 45 minutes, a quarter of a watch).

The fivefold maJ)QaJa appears again in a Sahara-school Vajrayoginis4Jha114 (GSS19), which is the only fivefold IDa.J)Qala not to have Vajravarahi as its presiding goddess but Vajrayogini. In this prac-tice, the four retinue goddesses are installed in position with a flower-offering mantra. The iconography of the goddesses in Cakra.saqtvara texts is either that of our texts (e.g., NYA, Samvarama!\"/414 p. 2.6) or slightly different (e.g., SUT ch. 13, vv. 2.5-2.8a). The latter supplies a dose parallel to Umapatideva's verses, except that the goddesses are only two-armed and hold a skull bowl and chop-per plw staff. 446 As shown above, Sanderson (199.P: 95) has demonstrated that much of this material has its roots in esoteric Saivism, for example, a class of yogini caJJed \"Lamas\" is also mentioned in the L4ghuia'!'wtrllt4ntrll ch. 19 (ch. 2.9 of the Saiva SiJJhayogdvarimat4).

For Siiraligamavajra's commentary, see Kalff 1979: 151, n. I. 448 Umapatideva draws closely on the SUT (ch. 13) and cites verses from the YSCT (see Textual Note to v. 41), although he does not follow the structure of these sources, in which the outer goddesses arc to be installed last (i.e., after the site goddesses of the founh meditation stage). 449 A similar description in GSSs (Sed p. 134, KliV}) also omits the colors, but these arc confirmed by St.rr ch. 13, vv. 19-33 and HA (f. 8r4). The iconographical schema generally echoes that of the St.rr in which, how~cr, the goddesses hold a chopper rather than a cJamaru (as did the petal goddesses in that source). The similarity between the gate goddCS$CS and the petal goddesses is mentioned in GSSn v . .p, and in related texts such as the YSCT (see Textual Notes). 450 A classical image of Yama appears in the third book {V~tnap~trvan) of the Mllh4bh4rlllll. in the S4vitryup4lthya114, where Y ama is described as handsome but dark, with red eyes, terrifying and holding a noose, wearing a yellow gar-ment and with bound-up hair. With his noose he forcibly extracts the \"thumb-sized person\" from the dying body. Y ama is taken over in Buddhist sources as the god of death, but other forms also appear, such as Yamantaka, \"slopper of death,\" with a new iconography. The latter's main forms arc Raktayamari, Krf~ayamari, and Vajrabhairava Yamantaka (SIIcreti Art ofTibtt pp. 183-89, with plates). 451 This set of gate goddessa is similar to that of the Hcruka-Hevajra m~. in which Si~ replaces Kikasyi, e.g .• Hcvajra and Nairatmi m~cJalas NYA (pp. 14 and 16). 451 For other rc&rences to the outer goddesses in the ·samiiJIICaltra. • sec GSSs (Sed p. 1357• K:z.1vs): SII1NIJ\"CUrasthllnlim amoghllsiJJhi/1; NYA (p. :z.8); ADUT ch. 9 (pp. 2.89-90): sarna:~~~caltraviluJJhib. and Sraratigamavajra's commentary to the ADUT (see ch. 14, Kalff I979= 117 n.1).

Here, the site goddessa of the cittlle11ltra are also called wzjrtUjA/rinis (as they arc surrounded by ring of vajras) and the vtiltcaltra site goddesses ~ni (as they arc sur-rounded by a ring of lotuses). The Tibetan tradition attested by K. Gyatso (1997: 44) desaibes the lotus petals as the level of\"grcat bliss,\" and the outer-most cakra as the \"pledge\" (S111111ZJMaltra)."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 187-189 453 \"Circle of great bliss\" may be a reference to the blissful conception of the god-dess in the sequence of awakenings within the dharmot~Aya. a synonym for vagina or womb. A \"body of great bliss\" (1114hasulthllktlya) is also applied to a fourth buddha body, whose transcendent status may be refleaed by the cen-trality of the wwhllsulthacalmt in the m~<}.ala. The yogic system of body cakras also designates the head cakra as the mllhasulthacaltra, but the fact that the terms coincide is probably incidental, as none of the other levels of the ~4ala are related, as such, to the body cakras. The terms pledge circle (samayacaltram) and knowledge circle {jfuinacaltram). as we have seen, applied initially during the self-generation of the goddess and her m~<}.ala. The further testimony of the higher tantric commentaries would be of interest. 454 Similar paragraphs describing the three cakras appear twice in GSS5 (Sed p. 1332 K2.1r1 and Sed p. 142.2 K2.8r4). The first instance (GSSs K2.1n: tatibahir ... ) comes after the description of the fivefold m~<}.ala and describes the next levd of the complete ~4ala, namdy, the site goddesses on the three cakras that \"have the nature of' (svabhdW[U) the sites. Here, there is no mention of the site goddesses as generic groups within the cosmos, as in GSSu (lth«arir,ul'!' sa'!'graha/1 etc.). The next instance (GSSs K2.8r4) is in the context of the body maJ]<}.ala (cf. §30). Here, the site goddesses are identified with a site and a body point; these are then associated with the ten places (as GSSu v. 43ff.). The ref-erence to the goddesses as a generic group is made at this point. This assigns them to the levd of the cosmos in which they \"move\" and accords with the cos-mological location of their particular calera. In the ADUT, as in GSSs (K2.8r4), this detail is reserved for the descriptions of the body ~<}.ala. Thus, the ADUT (ch. 9 pp. 2.85--86) correlates the god/goddesses with the sites and body points, allocates them to the ten places, and finishes with the collective desig-nation of the goddesses of the cakra (pp. 2.85-86): cittacaltrasyalth«ari ... ; viltcaltrllSJil bhiicari ... ; ltJiyacaltrasya pittiltzvisini .... It is notable that this text refers to a single female goddess instead of to a .. group, .. despite the fact that the text has just described a collection of eight site gods and site goddessa (male and female) in union on the calera.

This is also discussed by Kalff (1979: 81ff.). 456 Redacting from his sauce texts, Umapatideva gives goddesses on the three cakras a generic status as \"the congregation of goddesses\" (see n. 454 above). At §21, however, he is no longer redacting, and the outer-goddesses are simply \"to be visualized\" (bhiivyii~) within the eight cremation grounds. 457 The process ofUmapatideva's redaction from the HA is evident here. Luyipada follows his description of the outer goddesses with a remark applying to the full mal).cjala, namely, that vajra garlands are worn by all heroes and yoginis of the mal).cjala, (f. 8V2): sarvefiiJ'!l virayogininii1'fllaliipe vajramiilii. Umapatideva has therefore borrowed the closing line ofLuyipada's iconographical prescriptions to mark the end of this section of his text. Possibly incorporating a marginal note, the Tibetan text (p. 40.1) seems to have added that the goddesses are adorned by \"five skulls residing in the center of (two? da~ vajramiiliis\" (the Tibetan syntax is not smooth). 4 58 First, the Abhisamayamafijari states that all the deities of the mal).4aia may be visu-alized as two-armed, except (it seems) Qakini, etc., who are said to be four-armed. The two-armed outer goddeses, Kakasya, etc., hold only a skull bowl in their left hands (with the staff tucked into the crook of their arms) and a <J.amaru in their right; everything else is as described before. Another alternative to the visualiza-tion is that the central form ofVajravarahi may be visualized as either yellow or blue. In this case, the four goddesses on the petals (Qakini, etc.) are all yellow, and presumably two-armed, as they are said to hold in their right hands a r/amaru. The yoginis of the three circles change their color and their attributes also. Those of the mind circle are now white, and (apart from the bowl and staff on their left sides) they hold a vajra threateningly in their right hands; those of the speech cir-cle are black and hold a lotus; those of the body circle are red and hold a wheel.

For example, in the Alqobhya ~IWJ4aia, Alqobhya at the center is presided over by Vajrasanva (ibUI.: 5, summarized p. 35), while in the Vajrasattva ~IWJ4ala, the leader Vajrasanva is presided over by Alqobhya (from the Sa,pU!I#Ilntra ibid.: 8, summarized p. 37). The correlations are usually with five buddha families, but sometimes with the six, although on occasion they are \"not reliable enough to be dependable\" (see B. Bhanacharyya's comment, ibiJ.: 40). 461 A fourfold division of worlds is not new; it appears, for instance, in the STIS ch. 6 (p. 59), which describes the conversion of the brahmanical overlord NaraYaJ)a and his retinue. Here V~u's retinue comprises the gods of inter-mediate space, of space, of the earth and the underworld, and their female counterparts ( antllri/qacari-; lth«ari-; bhucari-; p4tti/4vti.sini-). 462 Sircar (1948: 8-u) notes that the earliest written evidence of the p~thas is prob-ably the reference to them as places of laltti worship in the Mah4bhdratll (nrthaytitrti, Vanaparvan) at a site actually associated with Bhimadevi. Sec Sanderson (1994i: 94-95) for references to the Saiva ritual texts influential here, such as the Yoginii4Jt,a1J4, ch. 16 of Tantraslllibhava. 463 Sanderson (personal communication) points to the systems of twenty-four pifhas in the Kubjiluimlllll (22.23-36) and in Tantrilolta29·53-72b (especially Tantrilolta 29.71c-72b): h.rt ltur.v!a/i bhruvor matlhyam naJ ~~~ ltramtlt trayam II lmalanlini dru1fUI.b (drum4f1 em.: ltramtited.) lqnrabhava'!' sadyoginiga1Jilm. He states (ibid) that an earlier version in the Trika is seen in the Nilisll,ara, pa/ll/4 4 and the Tantrasatlhhava, pata/4 19 (lqnropa/q~trtirt:aNim). The devel-oping cosmological model of the cremation grounds in the Buddhist tradition may have its roots in the Saiva model of the sites, which are each said to include a goddess, a cremation ground. a tree, and a Bhairava who is the ~apala (Mayer 1996: 119, citing Sanderson, personal communication). 464 The geographic location of the sites has been discussed by some secondary authors, e.g., Sircar (1948), Kalff (1979: 98-107) drawing on Sircar and othcn, and Boord (1994: 27-32) summarizing ancient and modem sources (including the accounts of Chinese pilgrims from Hazra 1983). 465 There is a twelvefold system of places in the Hevajra tradition, which leads to a twelvefold enumeration of the bodhisllnvabhiimis (HT1.7.11, see Snellgrove's note p. 69). The Hevajra system describes the same list, but follows (or repbccs) ~ldpalta and upam~/dpalta with two other kinds of \"place\" called piiAVIl and upapiiAva(HT1.7.10, HT1.7.13, HT1.7.17). Kalff(1979: 101) notes that there is no agreement between the Hevajra and Cakrascupvara systems as to which sites belong to which category, and, moreover, only nineteen of the sites coincide and can be identified with each other. Snellgrove (1959: 70) attempts to rec-oncile the two lists. 466 For references in Cakrascupvara literature to the division of sites into places, sec"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 196-197 SliT ch. 9, vv. 13-19; Tsuda (p. 171) also cites their appearance in the S.'!'JIU!II· t4ntrll (lttt/pll s. praltar11p4 1), the f?4k4r!JA111l {pllfllla 15, giving a \"'very unusual\" account of the sites in comparison), ADliT (chs. s. 9· 14, and s6). and the Yoginislnflc4rll (cbs. sand 13).

Indian exegetes had also struggled with the terms. Snell-grove mentions Dharmakini's etymologies that attempt to explain the terms, for example clumtlohll: \"because one desires and yearns, it is called chllntlo.\" Kalff (1979: 158) also broaches this topic, noting: \"There is no ready transla-tion for the term chllruloh4.'\" 467 Tsuda's translation ofSUT ch. 9, v. 11: ~riyli ni'JII'!' llljj4bhll]a-Nilllni c11 Jll I fjUini~bhitll/1 lllhlljll iti luztbyllu I tkl~ tkl~ 'bhij4]anu Jotinib s~t SMil1; cf. also SUTch. 8, v. 15.

The implicit hierarchy here is corroborated by a (fibetan) school cited by him (p. 157) that correlates different types of vihu/Jhi with divisions of the tantric corpus: the purification of the (gross) psychophysical organism (sltmuihtls, tlh4tus. ~) with the \"father tantras\" (yogottaratantra texts), the (yogic) purification of the veins with the \"'mother tantras\" (yoganiruttaralyoginitantras), and the purifi-cation of both with the \"nondual tantras\" (/Gikumatllntra, Nli1Nilll'flgiti).

The Grhyasiitras and Srautasiitras refer to the 1'1lllhllyajfi4s in the same terms, although sources differ as to the order in which the five are presented.

The offerings are pre-sented by sidhakas when they enter a power site, in order to gratify (and so pla-cate) its guardian (lqmllJNll4lsthanllJHIIA), and are accompanied by wild laughter and the rattling of the tjllm4ru drum, with a bllli1Nlntr4 (o'f' hri'!' hU'f' '\"h4fJ p!Mt 2 ... ).

This imaginary process of transferral is usually accomplished along a \"circuit of energy\" that runs from the sadhaka into the victim, and back again. In the tasting of nectar, the yogin visualizes the rays extracting the essences of the heroes, transferring them into the three syllables, and thence back into the nectar; the \"circuit of energy\" is here supplied by the rays from the syllables. 500 See GSS16 K8u6 (n. 490); also GSS5 (Sed p. 13515, K23r5 cont.): punas"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"494 NOTES TO PAGES 211-212. trytz/tplm:uiJhidhdJ4tm4no ma~nm,z ca jihvi]d1!J iult!Ahu,Jtarajayava-phaiapramllf.UZ'!' iultlavajra'!' tihylitrHi t4Jraiminaliltay4 prdlana'!' lturytlt. tato va/qyamli!Jii/.tllpaJiircanamantrai/J stuytit. • naliltay4] em.; naliltaylibhib K. 501 For other references to the bali ritual in GSS texts, see GSS31 (I<I04f-v); SM2.51 (p. 495); GSSs (Sed p. 14f, K2.9r-v-Caltrasa,varabalivU/hi p. 57); GSS35 (I<I19r); GSS36 (I<I11r). 501 E.g., YSCf (8th JNl!llla A4r, Bsv): liltranlllj>lltlordhvatJ.\"!ti'!' {>s} 111; with com-mentary Yoginisa'!'cliranibanJh4/·Sa'!'Ciiratantrapdjilu1\" cited by Sanderson 1994= urtihvaJ.'!.ti'!' tv iti wlmavalitordhvaJ.\"!.IJii· 503 For plut as in GSSu, see HA (f11v), GSSu, GSS31, SM2.18, (Jut in ADUT ch. 9, p. 187, possibly a misreading of plut by Kalff).

This is more clearly related to the rite according to the Samaja system, Siimiijika-sarvabhautikabalividhi (VA SP f. 121r.1), said to be according to the method of the Pi?JrJikrama (Nagarjuna) and the Caturariga (Buddhajiianapada), and also to the Hevajra-based rite, Haivajrikasarvabhautikabalividhi (VA SP f. 124 v. 6). 509 Cakrasa'Yj'lvarabalividhi (p. 58)-GSS5 (Sed p. 14411, K3or2): tadamrtabhakfa?Jiid dikpiiliidayo mahiisukhasamarpitavigrahii bhiivyii~; GSS16 (K81vr): eva'Yf'l pri?Jayet. pitvii mahiisukham anuvarteta (understand: causative). 510 GSS31 (Kro4n) prescribes a bali ritual to be performed in secrecy at midnight, in which the yogin is to assume the warrior stance of the deity and stand naked with loose hair on a hilltop facing south (cf. ADUT ch. 14, p. 326). Note also the bali ritual in HT2.4, which mentions protection (sattviinii'Yj'l prii7Jarakfiiya vighniid viniiyakiid api) and then lists the types of siddhi that will ensue from the worship of\"all beings\" through utterance of the bali mantras and apabhra'Yj'lfa verses (HT 2.4.89c---95d): vafyiibhiciiraripusainyaniifanam uccii.tanamiira1Jiikarfa7Ja'Yf'l ca fiintisukha'Yf'l paUffika'Yf'l bhavet ca. 5II The term is unexplained by Tsuda, but Sanderson (1999: personal communi-cation) translates \"teacher's assistant.\" According to the rites of the Kriyiisamuc-caya, the karmavajrin is a ritual specialist, much like the karmiiciirya in Newar ritual practice, whose task is to ensure the correct performance of the rites (Gellner 1992: 273, with n.25). 512 VA (SP f. 122ff.): anyiirtham api balipradiine mantre yathiisa'Yj'lbhava'Yf'l me mameti vii yathiivasthitam eva pafhaniya'Yf'l. sa ciitmatveniidhimoktavya~. asyopakiire mamaivopakiiro bhavatity iifayato hitakiiryasiddhir bhavati. anantare ca tadar-tham vijfiiipayed ....

The bali offerings are made to the ten krodhas and/ or fifteen protectors (the eight protectors plus seven brahmanical gods in between), in an external rite that is to take place away from the meditation hut. In this rite, the recipients are represented by clay balls (mrtpi1Jtfi) surmounted by appro-priately colored banners arranged on the ground in their respective directions. Beyond those, the mantrin should offer saucers of milk to the eight nagas who are either represented by clay balls or by circular cow pats (gomayak_rtama1Jf/dla-), and outside that, he is to strew bali of boiled rice and five streams of the \"pure\" nectars-ghee, honey, water, wine, and milk-while circumambulating. Sanderson (1997: personal communication) notes that this is very similar to the standard Saiva bali, also called \"external\" (bahya-). 513 The form of the mantra is: O'f!l vajra-[name of krodha] vajra ima'!l bali'f!l grh1Ja amukasya fdnti'f!l rakfd'f!l ca kuru hu'!l phaf. The names of the ten krodhas to be inserted into the mantras are: (1) Vajrahul!lkara, (2) Vajradal).<;ia, (3) Vajrana-larka, (4) Vajrakul).<;iali, (5) Vajraya~a, (6) Vajrakala, (7) Vajramahabala, (8) Vajrabhi~al).a, (9) Vajro~I).i~acakravarti, and (ro) Vajrapatala. They are under-stood to occupy a circle of protection with ten \"spokes\" radiating from the central point of the meditation hut (sakrodhadafdrarakfdcakra-). For the pro-tective function of the ten krodhas, see also the \"rite of expelling obstacles\" (vighnanivdra1JavidhiVA, SP f. 252.3). 514 E.g., GSS18 (K83r5): dadyat nifayd'f!l bali'!l sarvamdraprafamanam; GSS15 (K74v2): samayi sthandtmayogarakfdyai sarvavighnopafamanamantram udirayet.

They arc the CllltrllSil'!'VttrttpujaviJhi (NGMPP Dnhs) and Hn~ajrllSil~ipttmisaTNidhipUja(Takaoka DH 372).

Sasvaravajra's HIIStllpUjll-viJhi contains a colophon following the hmttzpiija (and its stated source in the /Yogini}-S4'!'cdrtttllntrtt). It continues with the alternative bdhyttpujd text {]4Jw1 ... ) and supplies a second colophon verse at the end of that, which also describes the rite as a hllStllpiija(cited in Textual Notes). This httstapiijatcxt is also published in Mcizczahl (1985: 29ft), although with some errors (e.g., he omits the buddha ~obhya in his translation, thus mistakenly reducing the buddhas to five). Reference to the rite in the Yoginisa'!'CJlrlltllntrtt scripture is scant, with only the passing remark that if the yogin is poor then he may obtain what he nccd.s (food, drink, clothes, etc.) by means of the hand worship (A7r4i BuV2.): yogiJmiJrttm IZTthi sytit httstllpiijnw s9sitll'!' ( =safipsittzm) prlipy4 ... , and a further praise of the hart4piija in the fourteenth pa.1414. The consistent acknowledgment of a source in which the rite is not fully explained suggests either that our ritual texts relied on a different recension of the tantra, or upon a shared (~vara-bascd) source other than the YSCf, which also makes this claim."},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 218-220 499 525 Kriydsamuccaya's Gatzacakravidhi (cited Gellner 1992: 297, f. 4u): prajfuihinarrz yac cakrarrz tac cakrarrz matzt/amelakam. Gellner (ibid.) records that for Newar Buddhists today, a gatzacakra is a sacramental meal after a tantric ritual. For alcoholic substances, see Cakrasarrzvaravivrti (f. r8r-v cited above n. 519). The Kriyiisamuccaya mentions foods, e.g., (f. 4u): tad uktagatzacakra-vidhinii matzt/aliigiire khiinapiiniidibhif ... and sexual yogic practice, including the types of consort spelled out in its Nifiicakram, (f. 409): yoginiyogatantrefU yaduktarrz gatzamelakarrz .... vajrarrz padme prati!{hiipya bodhicittarrz na cots.rJet . . . . evarrzvidhe nifiicakre varjana<rrz> naiva kasyacit. janani<rrz> bhagini<rrz> caiva duhitarrz bhiigineyakiirrz. miimakasya tathii bhiiryiirrz svasrkiirrz -tathii punab I pitubhagini miituf ca ~tau prajfzii<p> susiddhidii<p>. etdsiirrz piijanarrz karya<rrz> bolakakkolayogatap. 526 The parallel texts also mention the goddesses who traditionally empower the psychophysical organism. As yoginitantra reflexes of the mothers, these god-desses are also consorts to the five buddhas. Sasvatavajra's Hastapiijiividhiopens with the yogin's conviction that on his hand are the elements with the nature of the goddesses (SM253, p. 498): svaviimakarasthiin prthivyaptejoviiyviikiifa-dhiitiin piitanimiiratzi-iikarfatzinartefvaripadmajiilinisvabhiiviin adhimucya .... As the buddhas are then placed immediately on the hand, there is an implicit pairing of the deities in union. Sakyaralq;ita (GSS5) moves this prescription to a later point in the rite (between the text equivalent to GSSu §46 and §47) that renders it less significant. Umapatideva's omission of this line may be to accom-modate his single-sex mat:Isfala; he is unable to remove the male buddhas from the hastapiijii, but he can remove any trace of their union. 527 GSS5 (Sed p. 14615, K32r3) (cited Textual Notes) describes them as \"their nails' face\" {-tannakhamukhefu). In the Tibetan text of the sadhana, the sixth buddha is placed only on \"the thumb's face\" (see apparatus: *arigufthamukha). Sobisch (2001: personal communication), however, confirms that other Tibetan sources also place the syllables on all the nails collectively, in line with oral instructions. E.g., bsTan 'd.zin padma'i rgyal mtshan's commentary reads: on the {lit.:) \"com-bined nails\" (p. 801: sen mo bsdus pa). 528 The same inversion of the three syllables is prescribed below in the alternative external worship at §50. For the traditional correlation see GSS5 (Sed p. 13411, K22f3): tad anu laliitakatzthahrdayefU orrz-iip-hiirrz-ityakfariitzi fuklaraktaniliini nivefayet, and for example, the Khasarpat:Ia-Lokdvara sadhanas, e.g., SM13 (p. 37): tatab firasi orrzkiirarrz, katztbe iipkiirarrz, hrdi hurrzkiiram, and for other pre-scriptions, SM7o (p. 142): [afzjalirrz} hrdi iirtziiyiirrz katzthe miirdhni nyaset; SM95 (p. 191): kiiyaviikcittefU orrz-iip-hiirrzkiiraparitzatiip khecari-bhiicari-nairiitmiif cin-taniyiip; Hevajrasekaprakriyii (p. q): adhifthiiya mahiimudriirrz buddhais traidhiitukasarrzsthitaip, firohrtpiidadefefU O'f!l hiirrz iip iti tryakfaraip. 529 This is also suggested by Sasvatavajra's parallel text (Finot p. 57: \"yadvii ... \"), as it is included as part of the text of the Hastapiijiividhi. This portion opens with a benediction and closes with a dedication of merit, both of which refer to the hastapiijii."},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"soo NOTES TO PAGES 220-222 530 In contrast, the parallel texts (cited in Textual Notes) state that it is for the ga!J4Cma to preside (g~AlrrllJhq~'fl ctiJhyqytz). presumably because they deal with the generation of the complete mat]4ala in the first instance, and not optionally, as in Umapatidcva's version of the rite. 531 GSS14 (K72vr6}: ltu!\"!a'ff ca ltl1rayn Umulb'\"JM.Ihamutprabh~Jata/11 clltllra-sra'!' vartu/4'!' tryasra'!' \"fJhtlnltitamaJhyllgam I S· I svahrtibijti'fllu<Tfl> samutsrjya jfulndgni'!' jainam uttllmllm I praJip4/«l/iltilttira'!' lta\"!IIJNI Jipti-vattaram 16. lltu~~ \"JJIS~J ~tgni<Tfl> bhava~>c Cll caturbhuj11m I vara44Jt.sasiitralutm41.JI!al;illultilt~ari!\"'<m > I 7.

The compound could also mean \"mountain thicket\" (or \"mountain and thicket\"), because gahvaram also means a thicket (adjcctivdy, it refers to something deep or impenetrable). How-ever, I prefer to understand \"cave,\" because this site is suggested by the paral-ld compound giriguhtl. e.g., SM24 (p. 61): vijanava111lima14nagiriguhasina-; SM24 (p. 54): flijanagiriphtiyi'!' sthbu lucau 'N !tva cit. Sanderson (199~ n. 8) notes that dscwbcre gahvara means a \"thicket.\" In the list of sites for siJJhi-SiiJhana in the StiT (ch. 11.2-3, f. u.3: girigabvaraltuiifrf'l mahod4Jhit4!qu vd), gahvara is more closdy defined in a following verse as a place \"full of trees\" (sab: p/nNtw ~i17Je ~ rNlrtllJn saJit), despite the semantic over-lap with ltuiija/1 (\"'a place over run with plants or overgrown with creepers,\" Monier-Williams 1899). Bhavabhana seems to recognize the problem with this interpretation, and glosses gahfNITa here as crevice or ravine, literally, \"a space between two walls of the [mountain]\" (C4ItrllS41fiiNlralliVJ1i f. 27r.2: giri/J par-INlta/J. gahvaraJabJma t1Uibhittitbaylint111'11m) (Sanderson op. cit.). It may be that there is some semantic overlap between \"crevice\" and \"thicket\" here, since ravines in mountains arc often thickly wooded. Other sources follow the inter-pretation in the StiT iadf, e.g., (16.1sab f. 31 r.1), and the Tibetan tl\"aDSlation of SM251, which takes girigahvara (in girigahwzrtiJi-) as a dwznJwt compound meaning \"mountain and dense copse\" (ri bo Jmzg tsh4ng tshing) (cited Sander-son op. cit.). Comparing UmllpatitinNiivenc 2 with the passage from the StiT (ch. 11.2--3), it is notable that the list of sites is almost identical, except that GSSn omits ltunjab. This might suggest the emendation <ltufijr> lmal4ne giri-g\"\"\"'-'\" CJL However, the conjecture g/HJrr is adopted here on the basis of the Tibetan text as shown. The Tibetan translates girigahwz\" \"on the peak of a mountain\" (p. 32..~ ri bo'i rtH nyitl na), and 0S1Uf1nidh4u as \"on the banks/ shore\" (p. 32.~ gram tltzt). 540 Lengthier sentiments of this kind in the BoJhiaryllvatllra (e.g., ch. 3, v. 9: titlritblltyi'fl ca sattvdntbJI nUihib syllm alqAyab ... ) arc glossed in Prajfiakara-mari' s commcnwy-apparcndy on the scriptural authority of the A1JIIfllljra-Jhvtljlritrtl---a$ the \"dedication\" (pari!Jiimand)of\"'roots of goodness\" (p. 39): sa tlini lnJ4/amuJ.ini pari'(lllmtlyan nNI'fl pari!fllmiiJilti.

According to the prose list (§1), the resolve to become a buddha in v. 7b relates to the \"arising of the will to enlightenment\" (boJhicittotplitlllb). 541 The simile derives, &mously, from one of the earliest Buddhist toas, the Mntlinlttll (Sutta Niptitll.1.8 v. 7): \"Jwt as a mother would proteetwith her life her own son, her only son, so one should cultivate an unbounded mind toward all beings ...

However, the reading with iuJJhll'!' in the d-jHit/ll of the verse is well attested. It appears in liiyipada's HA (f. I4f.4), and in all the GSS mss., such as the Ab~­jllri (GSSs K22V3) and in SM26 (p. 6s); SMt8o (p. 364); SM218 (p. 419: iuti-Jhll'!' tu). Isaacson (1996: personal communication) notes an early text that has the same reading, namely, Rahulagupta's Hn~~tjrllprllltllill, which probably dates from the late tenth century, since the author was supposedly a teacher of Ati5a (palmlcaf ms. IASWR MBB 1-34 f. 23r). In the ADUT ch. 9 (Kalff 1979 p. 303) reports three mss. reading luJJhm, but perhaps these mss. arc veering toward the reading attested by the Tibetan translation of his text, luJJhma. 544 The eight yoginis described by Umipatidcva arc possibly eight goddesses from the Vajravarahi retinue. In the Hcvajra tradition, Ratnakarawui (MulttliVIlii f. 2IV4) describes the yoginis as the eight yoginis Gauri, etc. {g~turydtiibhi/J), i.e., the eight goddesses who surround the central couple. Only four goddesses (J)akini, etc.) surround the central deity in the Vajravarihi m~9ala, however. 545 Sanderson (1998: personal communication) suggests that the visualization of the syllable Vll'!f is intended as an alternative (as is the case at §9), despite the lack of clarity in the verse. The Nllitz is frcquendy visualized as a subde ray of light rising from the dot (binJub) of the nasal ending (llnusvara/_1) of the sylla-ble, e.g., SM79 (p. 153): nliJo rlliminltha. 546 The following verses (36-37) seem to be scriptural, although I have not traced their source. Umapatidcva cites them as the starting point in each meditation stage to illustrate the composition of the m~4ala at its different phases. They do not appear in our recension of the vscr (nor derivative HA), which is curi-ow, as other pliJtucarlier do (vv. 38--40, §n). 547 The eight-part mantra appears in abbreviated form within the longer miiltz-mllntra given in §31.

It is also absent in §19, which has a slightly different opening sentence describing the body circle, perhaps because the reference to Meru has dropped out accidentally. 550 Sanderson (1994i: 95) shows that the inclusion of \"Grhadevata\" as a site is an anomaly, the roots of which lie in the Buddhist redaction of these lists from the Saiva Tantrasadbhiiva (Adhikiira 19; Yoginilak!a~a). In the source texts, each site is equated with groups of deities. In these pairings, Saur~~ra is cor-related with the set of household deities (grhadevatii). Sanderson concludes: \"Evidently, while intending to extract only the place names from a list pairing names and deities, the redactor's mind has drifted without his being aware of it from the name-list to that of the deity-list and back again.\" 551 The correct Sanskrit for the site is Kuliitii (sometimes Kuliitam, Kuliitab); in the vernacular, Kulu. The Cakrasarp.vara corpus seems to have been responsi-ble for a preservation of the erroneous form, Kulutii, even in redactions out-side scripture (Sanderson 1997: personal communication). 552 Following this prescription the Tibetan text continues, \"Alternatively, medi-tate on them as being to the east etc. of the palace\" (p. 39·7= yang na gzhal yas khang gi shar Ia sogs pa rnams su bsgom par bya'o). 553 The translation \"factors that favor enlightenment\" (bodhipiikfikadharmaslbodhi-pak!adharma) has been suggested by Sanderson (1997: personal communica-tion). The set is listed in Abhidharmakofalbhfi!ya ch. 6, v. 67ab and explained there (v. 67b-c) as favorable (anuloma) to enlightenment (bodhi~). Gethin (2001), in his comprehensive analysis of the bodhipakkiyii dhammii, translates, \"Dhammas that Contribute to Awakening.\" Having discussed the variations in the forms of the term in Pali and Sanskrit, with commentarial definitions of the set, he concludes (ibid.: 284-302): \"we should not be misled by English transla-tions such as 'helping,' 'aiding,' 'favorable to,' 'conducive to' and so on, into thinking that the relationship between bodhi-pakkhiyii dhammii and bodhi is one of rather vaguely and generally assisting in the bringing about of awakening. On the contrary, they appear to be thought of as rather closely and definitely related to bodhi.\" Other scholars suggest \"adjutants ofbodhi,'' including Pruden (1991, n. 422, p. 1080), who also lists the appearance of the set in Pali and Sanskrit Buddhist sources. Gethin' s book is the fullest and most recent analysis of the seven sets of doctrinal formulas that make up the thirty-seven factors. He deals first with each of the seven sets individually (chs. 1-6), and then turns to their appearance as a collective set in the Pali Nikayas and Abhidhamma, with some reference also to Sanskrit Abhidharmic sources (chs. 7-10)."},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"NOTE TO PAGE 263 U mapatideva' s glosses on the bodhipiikfikadharmas are the fullest example of Abhidharmic exegesis in the GSS collection. His work reveals the influence of Abhidharmic mainstays, such as the Abhidharmakofa and bhiifya (ch. 6) and the Arthavinifcayasiitra (chs. 13-19), and has a strongly traditional basis, as when he cites Pai_lini (§23) to explain the smrtyupasthanas, thus taking after Ya5omi-tra (t.yakhydp. 104). However, we will see that it also has many unpredictable moments when the formulas are not listed in standard order. This may be unique to U mapatideva. Other tantric texts, such as the Sarrzpupatantra ch. I (Skorupski 1994: 224-31), also cite traditional glosses, but use the correct sequences; similarly the Vasantatilakafikii (ch. 7, p. 51), although this text shows some overlap with Umapatideva's lists (e.g., anusm.rtyupasthanas ch. 7, v. 2, p. 52, rddhipadas p. 53, etc.).

I am grateful to Dr. James Benson for his help with this sentence. 563 As Gethin (2001: 105) points out, the complete list of inJriyas, \"probably com-mon to all Buddhist schools,\" contains twenty-two such faculties. This set comprises the \"spiritual .. faculties (i.e., numbers fifteen to nineteen). His dis-cussion of the set ends with comments upon their \"ubiquity in the Nikayas\" (ibid.: 138-40). I follow Professor Sanderson's suggestions for the translation of this paragraph. 564 Some of these glosses appear in Asu/N, although not aU relating to the inJriyas. For fraJJhnuiriya. the Asu/N also glosses fratiJhd. \"c~fllSil!7 prastldlz/1' (ch. 16, p. 223; also given ADKIB ch. 2., v. 25ff.) and supplies the same connections with samyagt/.\"!.ti and ltarmavipalta (Asii/Asu/N ch. 16, pp. 31h24). For virymdriya. Umapatidcva gives the gloss supplied in Asii/N (ch. 16, p. 223) but under virya-.rtlJhipada (§2.4). For sm,rtnulriya, Umapatideva supplies a similar gloss to that in the AsuJN ch. 16 (p. 2.2.3): sm,rtir iillzmba1111pramiJ!4!7, which would indeed be repeating what he has said above (§23), although this docs not pre-vent him from repeating it in the next paragraph. For SllmdJhinJriya. Umapatidcva's gloss on SllmdJhi is identical with the AsuJN (p. 2.2.3): SllmdJhil cittllSyailulgratd. For prajnmJriya. he differs from the traditional gloss on prajfid in this context (ADK/B ch. 6, v. 68fT., p. 1017): sm,rtyupasthllntlni Jharma-pravicayasambodhyanga'!' Sllmyagt/.'1#1 ca prajiitziva; Asu/N (p. 223): prajfid Jharmapravicaya/1. But his reference to mental states to be abandoned or devel-oped seems to draw on the description of chanJil-rJJhipaJa given in the AsuJN, which defines these mental states cxacdy (AsuJN pp. 22.o-21). 565 In this sequence, Umapatidcva draws on traditional Abhidharmic exegesis, e.g., AKD/B ch. 6, vv. 68-69 (p. 102.0): inJriyi!Jii'!' lti'!'/trto 'nukrama/J? fraJJa-dha1W hi pha/Jirtha'!' viryam arabhau, lirabJhaviryasya sm.rtir upatifP,au ... ; cf. the identical analysis in the AsuJN (p. 224). Umapatidcva's text, however, is closer to the Asii itself (ch. 16, P· 32.; cf. sa,pU!\"fflntra ch. I, P· 22.7). Like the sutra, u mapatidcva omits friU!Jhli from the sequence, having dealt with it first (and in the same manner). He then echoes the relative-clause construction of the siitra in dealing with the remaining inJriyas. His exposition amounts to a shon, derivative summary of the contents of the Asii, with some changes; for example, he glosses the verb samud4nayati with upat!haultayati and changes the phrasing 114 vipra1Jiiiayati to abhimulthiltaroti.

Gcthin (2001: 205-7) offers reflections on the sig-nificance of the term \"noble\" in Pali sources within his wider analysis of this sequence (ibUJ.: 1~226). The aim of the eightfold path is couched here in Y ogacara terms as the anti-dote to jMytiVIlra!Jil (the obstructive belief that things reaLly exist as other than consciousness, i.e., belief in an object) and to ltkillVIlrtl!Jil (the obstructive belief in real individuality Slltlt4yat/,Tf!i!J, i.e., beliefin a subject). The Asii/N describes it in more traditional terms as the antidote to wrong views, etc.(ch. 19, p. 231): m~thyat1,7'f.tipr1Ztipalq~ yavan mithyasllmdtlhiprllti~ SllmJilgdmy4Jind1fl margangana'!' Jllthaltrama'!' VJ4vasthil .... The sequence of the eightfold path in relation to the Sll'!Jboe/hytzngllS is dis-cussed in the ADK/8 ch. 6, v. 67b ff. The wider context of the discussion is of the relative position on the path (margll/J) of each of the boJhiplllqaJharmas (ADKJB ch. 6; cf. Vasllntlltilaufilta ch. 7• p. si). It is to this discussion that Umapatideva refers here (ADK ch. 6, v. 1ab: ltkillprllh4!J4m althyatll'!' slltyaeillrlan~~bhavandt ... ) . Abhidharmikas ennumerated five stages of the path (sll'!'bharllmlirgll, pr11J0ga0, tillrlll1Ut0, bhavlln4°, lliailqll0), in the course of which all defilements (ltkills) would be removed. In this analysis, the eightfold path is said to belong to the path of seeing (urUnumuirgll/1), that is. the path of removing {prahd1,14mdrga!J) the ltklllS ofbeliefin a sdf ((i.Tf!ib). The type and number of ltkills are reckoned according to how \"strong\" they are, and how \"weak\" the practitioner is. The most subtle ltk14s arc destroyed only once the tlllrillnilmlirga has been traversed (according to some, this happens in a flash), and the stage of \"meditation\" is reached. The bhavanamlirgll comprises the path of removing more subtle defilements (rligll/1. Jw.Sil/1) (cf. Vaslln~ ch. 7, p. 56: ltklavara!\"'prlltipll/q~ tillrillumargam ulttva jfl9dvara!\"l-pr1Ztipll/qll'!' bhavanamlirgam ahtt). The subtlest ltkillS are removed with the very highest meditation, called VajmpamASilmdtihi, and this opens the way to the final path of \"no more training\" (llillilqll), which is characterized by the \"knowledge of the destruction of the defilements\" (/qllylljfilln~~m) and \"knowl-edge that they will never arise again\" (llnutp4Jiljfilinllm).ln GSSu, Umapatidcva ascribes the eightfold path to both paths, the tlllrilln~~marga and bhavalllbnllrga. In the Vasllntatiillltafilta it belongs only to the latter (ch. 7, p. 56: tlltrll bhavandmarg~ jfl9dvaTil!\"'<'!'> nifnvabhaVIlm iti yli JhjfJ Sli Sll\"'JJlP.'!.tib· .. ). The varying distribution of the bodhiJN1lt!iluzJharmas over the five paths is dis-cussed by Gcthin (2001: 338-42). 569 The change to the normal sequence of bodhipalqi!tlliJhllT'miiS (in which the SllmyUprahli!\"'S appear second) has been discussed above. It may, possibly, be accounted for by the designation of the set Sllmyllk, since the prefix s11myalt in the case of the eightfold path gives it an inclusive and hence higher position in the sequence of bodhipdlqi/tllliluz17NlS (see especially Vyalthya on ADKJB ch. 6, v. 68, p. 1017). However, the traditional glosses on the fust praha!\"'S (ADKIB"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"NOTE TO PAGE 171 69a. V]ilkhytl p. 1015, Asii/N ch. 14) justify their original position in the sequence, in that they are causally related to the .rJJhi}NiMs (for example, the abandoning of unskillful states gives rise to chanJ., the fim of the .rJJbiplil/as; pt'llh4!f11 is also defined as viryt~). The meaning of SllmJ\"/tprahli!\"' is \"right abandonment,• and this term (\"pr~) is usual in Sanskrit sources. However, the Pali term for this four-fold formula was \"'right dfon,\" Sllmm4-{p)p;u/h4Nl (e.g., Dighani/t4y41I.110, Mlljjhimllnilt4ya II.n, Ill.196; funher references in PED). There is another similar set of four ptuJh4n4.s in Pali literature, namdy, restraint [of the senses] (Sil'flfHli\"'I/J), abandonment [of sinful thoughts] {p4ha11111n), cultivation [of skill-ful states] (bh4van4), and guarding [skillful states] (•nur~) (Dightmi/uiy4 111.11S, Anptt4rt~nikliya 11.16, etc.). •Effon\" {ptuJhli1111m, pr1Uihtl114m) seems to be the older term, and indeed this is what the older Chinese translations tend to translate. However, the linguistic similarity of the Pall {ptuJhli\"\"\"'Jwith the Sanskrit~). and the inclusion of the sage \"'abandonment\" in both four-fold formulas, seem to have given rise to the later usage. Thus, later Chinese translations render pr~ and it is this reading that also went into Tibetan translations (see Pruden's translation of Abh~ 1991, n. 413, p. 1080 to AbhiJhllrrNlkoltz). For a fuller analysis of the terminology behind the \"right endeavon,\" see Gethin (1001: 69-71) and following (71-80) for his discussion of the set. A different list of four efforts (S41IIJU-prlllih4114) is also found in San-skrit literature, namdy: effon (prltJ'#NI!I), endurance (utsah.b). valor (viryam), and resolve (V]tl~). The sequence in which the stages appear in the texts varies, and although Umapatideva's coincide with none of the Abhidhannic sources mentioned here, it is a sequence found in the YSCr ch. 2., v. 8, as shown here in endnote table x.

The HA (£i4v6) is unclear, but may read vrftlt~. 574 A variant in other texts reads \"armpits,\" bllhumUIAyop (YSCf ch. I3, ADUT ch. 9. p. 2.8s). 575 My ms. B of the YSCf (B f. 3r4) is corrupt at this point (and ms. A is dam-aged). The aspect of the body is usually \"eyes'\" for the hero Ankurika. How-ever, YSCf (B f. 3r4) gives lt11/qllyor, repeating the body point occupied by the goddess. This is followed by a shon passage of dittography; the mansucript later omits the corrdations between numbers 14 (\"'belly'\") and 22 (\"Padma-nane$vara \"). 576 Other texts also read \"mouth,'\" e.g., multhmthtiM (SUT ch. 7, v. 1oa, multM YSCf ch. I3, ADUT chs. 9 and I4, K. Gyatso 1997: 41). In the Cakrasal!lvara body mat;~4ala, the aspect of the body for the hero, Subhadra, has many variants. Kalff (op. cit.: 196) compares the Sanskrit readings in different"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PAGES 275-277 511 sources and different manuscripts (e.g., gru./41Nlrtib in SUT ch. 7, v. 10b; ppaVIIrti in ADU11 and their Tibetan translations, arguing that the intended meaning is \"coiled gut.\"' Other readings include gupaVIItti (GSS7); gru}aVIIrtti (HA f. 15r.1-2. and SlJ11; gu/aVIIti (YSCf 8 f. 3r.~). 577 The body~ practice in the CakrasaJpvara tradition gives thls body point as \"penis\"' (~w)with the corrupt form 1MUilm (YSCf ms. B); mnbt (HA, GSSs, GSSn); mNjlmuthllne (SliT ch. 7, v. ua); metjhrt (ADtrr ch. 9). Cf. ADliT ch. 1~ (with variants in different mss.: m~tbt. 111111jhw, mll!!J\"~. Tib.: bshang sgo). Kalff (op.cit.: 159) reads 1netjhw \"penis\" but notes that the Tibetan reads \"gate of excrement\" i.e., anus (although \"anus\" is already given in the San-skrit list for the eighteenth goddess Kha~J4arohi in Grhadcvati). One Tibetan tradition (K. Gyatso 1997: .p) gives \"the two tcsridcs\" and for the next site, the \"tip of the sex organ.\" An alternative reading, mnk, apparently for m~timi (meJAr .. \"marrow/fat\"'), is found in GSS7, but this seems likely to be another corruption of metjhrt. The body point \"penis\"' poses a problem for the Vajrayo-gini tradition in that the body mal)4aJa is supposedly conducted by the yogin who has self-generated himself as the goddess Vajravarahi. If the body maJ]Qala is taken to apply to the body of the (male) meditator and not to that of the yogin-as-goddess, then the emendation m~t/hw is justified. This is substanti-ated by the Tibetan, which reads \"genitals\"' (mJoms). 578 Other texts read Prn4Jhivllsini (YSCf ch. 13 and SliT ch. 7, v. 12.a). 579 Our tradition (GSS texts, YSCT ch. 13, HA) reads anguli, meaning either \"fingers• or \"toes,\" although the Tibetan translates as \"on the fingers\" (p. ~.~: sor mo 1714111S). Kal.ff (op. dt.: 159-6<>) notes that there are two traditions here (as also for the twenty-third goddess, see anp,tha below). One tradition spec-ifics \"toes\" (e.g., SliT ch. 7, v. LJ: JNIJangultzu; also the ADUT commentary by Siiraitgavajra: rluzngpa'i sor mo hn /4, \"on all the toc(s) of the foot\"). The other tradition is to understand both toes and fingers simultaneously. Thus, Luyipada states, \"the sixteen fingers (and toes) (sn-[sic] mo bcu drug, no refer-ence, Mcisczah11967: 2.96); C4/trflS1l1!1VIl1'llSiitlhana (Dawa-Samdup 1919: sor mo bcu tbw~; cf. Tucci b935II989: ~I). It seems to me most likdy that if one tra-dition is \"corrca,\" it would be that in which the nyisll takes place on two body pam at once (hands and feet), which is the same method as that employed for other body parts, such as the two shoulders, two thighs, two shanks, two knees, etc. In addition, the ny4s1t of sites/ deities in the lttiytt~ takes place on the body of the yogin who is seated in meditation; the toes and fingers arc there-fore proximate to each other and can easily count as one site. This is not the case if the yogin-deity visualizes himself in the warrior stance as Vajravirihi for the /uiyamA'.\"!a/4. s8o SIJJJmmat (fcm.: ultihumati) is literally \"having good,,. but this is usually trans-lated as if from sit/Jnmwti\"havingagood mind/heart,\" e.g., Dayal (1932.: 2.90). This is the standard translation of the Tibetan \"good intelligence/excellent knowledge\" (kgs pa'i blo gros). 581 Our tradition gives llnPf!hllJO~· also in the Tibetan translation (p. ~2..5: mth~"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"512 NOTES TO PAGES 279-291 bo day) (e.g., GSS texts, HA, ADUT, also its Tibetan translation, and SUTch. 7, v. 15). This is ambiguous since it may mean \"on the two thumbs\" or \"on the two big toes.\" Kalff (op. cit.: 160, n.1) again notes that two traditions exist. He states that Surangavajra's comment on the ADUT specifies the two big toes (rkangpa'i mthe bo gnyis Ia). The Cakrasa'f!lvarasiidhana (Dawa-Samdup op. cit.: 21) and Luyipada (Meisezahl op. cit.: 296) specify both thumbs and big toes (Tib.: mthe bong b'zi), as does Tucci (op. cit.: 41). Once again, I prefer the lat-ter, in line with the earlier arguments (v. 52a). 582 Vajravarahi's root mantra in GSSn has two parts. The first part comprises an abbreviated form of the eight-part mantra (see §12), in which the eight parts (indicated here by editorial hyphens) are run together by the omission of the mantra syllables enclosing the vocatives. The second part of the root mantra is a lengthy mantra beginning prottunge, introduced in the Tibetan by *tadyathii (p. 43.2). This also appears in GSS5 (Sed p. 13i\\ K24v6), directly following the full form of the eight-part mantra (GSS5 Sed p. 13i, K24v3), and the sec-ond part alone (prottunge .. .) appears in the Vajraviiriihisiidhana (Finot 1934: 6o-61=GSS3). In the Vajraviiriihisiidhana (Finot op. cit.) this is also called the mulamantra, but in GSS5 it is termed the \"garland mantra\" (GSS5 Sed p. 13i\\ K24v6: atha ca miilamantro bhavati). Variants appearing in the text of GSS5 are reported in the apparatus, with some variants from Finot (except where they seem to be the result of an illegible akfara or the result of the editor's misread-ing from his mss.). Notable variants from the Tibetan text (p. 43.1) are also shown. This root mantra (with a few variants) is the bulk ofSM221 (pp. 434-35). 583 The Saiva flavor of this epithet is unmistakable since Paramasiddhayogdvari is the name of a Saiva goddess from the nondual Trika tradition. 584 The term \"vajra words\" (kulifapada(l, vajrapada(l) refers to elements of mantras that cannot be understood as straightforward Sanskrit (cf. GS 9.17a). It refers here to those parts extracted from the mantras of the male deities in the Cakrasarp.vara mar:<;lala, e.g., kara kara. Another version of the mantra, con-sisting solely of the vajra words, appears in the bali ritual described below (§37). It also appears in this form in the *Mantrapiiffla (Finot op.cit.: 53-54) and Cakrasa'f(lvarabalividhi (ibid.: p. 57); also in the mantras of the twenty-four gods of the sites in the Cakrasarpvara mar:<;lala, as in the HA (f. 13r) and ADUT (ch. 14, pp. 324-25). A comprehensive edition of the male site gods' mantras is not provided here, but significant variants to the text of GSSn are shown in the apparatus from these sources. 585 I am grateful to Professor Sanderson for clarifying the edition and translation of this passage. This may be the mantra recited during ritual performances, as Sakyar~ita states that it is a general mantra, applicable to all types of ritual (GSS5 Sed p. 1392, K25v4: sarvakarmiko 'yal'J'l mantrap}. 586 There seem to be two traditions for the generation of the heads. The Sanskrit prescribes the syllable ka'f!l (presumably based on the meaning kam, \"head\") and the Tibetan, the syllable ii(l.

In the sur ch. 8, vv. 11Cd-16, this i111irllvttjr4verse follows the offering of food stuffs to the emanated IJW}4a)a (vv. 11Cd-14}, and it is the gods and goddesses of the sites who arc saluted specifically (v. 25). 590 The same mantras are prescribed in the parallel texts, GSSs (Sed pp. 14311-441.1, K19V3-30f3} and CUrllSil1fWilrllb.livU/hi (p. 58). The latter also indicates the recipients of each mantra offering (shown here in square brackets). 591 \"Sipping• (4amul1111m) is usually the ritual cleansing by sipping water and touching it to pans of the body (e.g., KriyisllmuccllJII SP f. 414.3: p4tiyicllmt~­n4Jilunp eiAttv4; f. -415.1: llalm4NUf1 t4to tilltwl sug11Nihllir Jotlh4yn (iotlhaytt conj.; ~SP) /uuiDfl).

Other piija texts mentioned are from GSS2 (Knrr), GSS2o (K84v5)-GSS25 (K92r2), and GSS35 (Kr19v3). 596 The text of GSSn contains one injunction \"to place the left hand (on)\" vdmahastarrz dattvd following the locative fucipradefe. The parallel texts (GSS5..,.Bdhyapujdvidhi) cited in the Textual Notes contain two similar injunc-tions (hastarrz dattvd). The construction is familar from other texts, e.g., Hevajrasekaprakriyd (firasi hastarrz dattva), Kumaracandra's pafzjikd on Krrtza-yamdritantra (p. no). 597 The meaning of vidarbha1Jam is explained by Padoux (1977: 345) as the utter-ance of the mantra a single time after the name. U mapatideva repeats the same sequence of offerings in the alternative bahyapujdbelow (§49) but without the injuction to insert the names. The parallel texts (cited in the Textual Notes) differ at this point because they deal with offerings to the entire ma1)4ala. U mapatideva intends this last offering to be to the outermost inhabitants of the ma1)4ala, in the manner of the final bali mantra. The same method is adopted for the outermost deities, the ten krodhas, in the Sarp.vara bali ritual in the VA (n. 513), their names likewise inserted before the mantras. 598 The parallel texts include this instruction (vak!yamd1Ja-); see Textual Notes. 599 The parallel text in GSS5 is cited in the Textual Notes, with some variants from the very close text of Sasvatavajra's Hastapujdvidhi (Finot op. cit.: 54-55) reported where of interest. (Text dealing with the Cakrasarpvara version of the rite and some ofFinot's emendations are not shown.) These two texts are also related (a little more distantly) to SM253 (pp. 498-500), which also contains Sasvatavajra's Hastapujdvidhi, and which Finot uses to supply the missing por-tion of his ms. 6oo The Tibetan text states that the syllables are placed on the five digits, with the sixth syllable on \"the thumb's face\" (see the apparatus to the Sanskrit edition). 601 The rite is mentioned only briefly in this tantra (seen. 524). 602 Sanderson (1998: personal communication) notes that ma'Jf!alakam is the term in both Buddhist and Saiva texts for this kind of simple outline traced during the course of most external rituals. 603 I am grateful to Professor Sanderson for explaining the corrupt Sanskrit text, with reference to the Sarrzpupodbhavatantra 6.3.18-22b. 604 The SUTch. 17, v. 42c has Prapura1Ja, which Umapatideva seems to have altered for metrical reasons to Prapurd1Ja, although the sense is not as good."},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"Bibliography I.

The series strives to shed light on the Indic Buddhist traditions by exposing them to historical-critical inquiry, illuminat-ing through contextualization and analysis these traditions' unique heritage and the significance of their contribution to the world's religious and philo-sophical achievements. We are pleased to make available to scholars and the intellectually curious some of the best contemporary research in the Indian and Tibetan traditions."}]
