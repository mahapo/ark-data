TheCompendium of Principles marks the emergence of mature Indian Buddhist tantra at theend of the seventh century, and immediately spawned a body of literary progeny that,over time, was consolidated into traditions known in some Indian circles as Yoga Tantra.These traditions represent one of the most widely disseminated Buddhist systems,exerting significant influence not only in the aforementioned regions but also in ⁄rıLanka; southeast Asia; central Asian centers of Buddhist activity such as Khotan;Mongolia; and Sumatra.During the first quarter of the eighth century the Compendium of Principles and textsassociated with it were transmitted to China. These south Indian traditions organized thetexs into an eighteen-part tantric corpus called the VajraŸekhara Yoga system. Becausethe flowering of tantra in China occurred during the eighth century, later developments ofIndian tantra did not have a significant impact there (or in Japan, whose traditions ofesoteric Buddhism stem from China during this period). Therefore, the Compendium ofPrinciples and its associated corpus of texts were never displaced by newer developmentsand continued as central fixtures of tantric Buddhism in China (until its decline) and inJapan to the present.In contradistinction, by the middle of the eighth century north Indian traditions beganconsolidating the Compendium of Principles and the texts that it spawned into a tradition"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introduction 2they referred to as “Yoga Tantra.” Beginning in the middle of the eighth century thesetraditions were transmitted to Tibet, where they were further developed and codifiedunder the rubric of Yoga Tantra already established in India. The transmission of theCompendium of Principles and its corpus of associated tantras in India and Tibetcontinued even after subsequent tantric developments replaced them on the cutting edgeof Buddhist tantra.The Compendium of Principles is arguably the single most important development ofBuddhist tantra, representing the first expression of mature institutional tantra in India.Ronald Davidson has cogently argued that the keystone of mature tantra is its centralmetaphor of coronation as a king and the deployment of royal power, and that thisreflects the internalization of the dominant early medieval Indian socio-political formsrevolving around violence and the exercise of power—the cultural milieu in which tantradeveloped.1 While Davidson subsumes the many elements considered to be“tantric”—including consecration, the use of mantras (verbal incantations), mudr›s(physical gestures), and deity yoga (generation of oneself as an enlightenedfigure)—under this central metaphor,2 this is only a partial explanation.Although I agree with Davidson that narrative is extremely important to the emergenceof mature Indian tantra, I will argue that central to this importance is narrative’s functionof self-consciously announcing and promoting its identity as a new and distinct Buddhisttradition, and that this importance is multi-faceted. Furthermore, I will argue that thesenarratives occur for the first time in an Indian Buddhist tantra in the Compendium ofPrinciples, and that this seminal Buddhist tantra is also the source of many distinctivetantric features that are developed further in subsequent tantras. Thus, it is my claim that   1 Ronald M.

What are itsinnovations, and how did it launch the revolution that is tantric Buddhism? How did itsubsequently grow into a full-blown tradition, with a constellation of tantras around it,exegetical traditions dedicated to it, and so forth?

Iwill then discuss significant aspects of the tantras closely assocated with the Compendiumof Principles.This discussion will focus on several innovative elements of the tantra. First, I willexamine the specifically tantric mythologies found in the Compendium of Principles,which are expressed in the narrative of ⁄›kyamuni’s enlightenment through the distinctlytantric process of the five manifest enlightenments and the Bodhisattva Vajrap› ̊i’ssubjugation of MaheŸvara. This will include a discussion of innovative tantrictechnologies, practices involving sex, violence, and even murder, and other death-relatedpractices. I will argue that the Compendium of Principles contains many elements notseen in earlier Buddhist tantras and also that several elements characteristic of laterBuddhist tantras, such as practices involving violence and sex, are already found here inembryonic form. I will also examine the status of the Compendium of Principles in thedevelopment of ma ̊ ̃ala structure from earlier three Buddha-family systems to five-family systems.I will then discuss the importance of other texts included in the Yoga Tantra corpussuch as the VajraŸekhara Tantra, the Conquest over the Three Worlds, the All SecretTantra, the ⁄rı Param›dya Tantra, the Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzas, and theVajra Essence Ornament Tantra.

I will also use theaccounts of the translation and transmission of several Yoga Tantras and theircommentaries to illustrate important aspects of the translation process.SourcesWhile I use Tibetan translations and, where available, Sanskrit editions of varioustantras and their exegetical literature, throughout this study I will draw heavily on anextensive introduction to and history of Yoga Tantra by the Tibetan polymath ButönRinchendrup (Bu ston Rin chen grub, aka Bu ston Rin po che or Bu ston Thams cadmkhyen pa, 1290-1364). This text, Ship for Launching onto the Ocean of Yoga Tantra,3includes a mytho-history of the origins of the Compendium of Principles and otherindividual Yoga Tantras as well as a detailed summary of each tantra-text, a   3 rNal ’byor rgyud kyi rgya mtshor ’jug pa’i gru gzings, in Collected Works of Bu ston, Part 11 da (Lhasa:Zhol Printing House, 1990; photographic reproduction Delhi: International Academy of Indian Culture,1968), 1a.1-92b.2.The two known editions of Butön’s Collected Works both stem from the same source: the traditionalxylographic edition published by the Zhöl Printing House (zhol par khang) in Lhasa. I came intopossession of the volume of Butön’s Collected Works with the Yoga Tantra texts I am using through thekindness of my adviser Jeffrey Hopkins, who brought the volume from Tibet and gave it to me when Ibegan this research.The photographic reproduction of the Lhasa wood-block prints produced in Delhi under thedirection of Lokesh Chandra made the Collected Works much more widely available than it otherwisewould have been. While one might expect this edition to be a faithful reproduction of the Lhasa edition,it is not. “Corrections” were made to the negatives before the Delhi edition was printed. In almost everycase of a variant reading that I have checked, the Delhi version’s “correction” was in fact a“miscorrection”: it actually introduced errors by changing correct readings in the Lhasa edition toincorrect readings. Therefore, I have used the Lhasa edition of Butön’s Yoga Tantra texts, and pagereferences are to this volume. The pagination of the two editions differs, since the Delhi edition assignsArabic numeral page numbers to each folio side of the Lhasa edition. However, the Lhasa edition pagenumbers can easily be located by reading the margin pagination on the front side of the folios in theDelhi edition."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Introduction 7historiographical account of their development in India, and an account of theirtranslation and dissemination in Tibet. Thus, it provides much of the structuralframework for this study in addition to much detailed information.A few remarks about Butön are necessary at the outset. He is arguably the mostinfluential redactor of the Tibetan Kangyur (bka’ ’gyur) and Tengyur (bstan ’gyur), thetranslations of Buddha-voiced texts and Indian commentaries on them, respectively;author of one of the central Tibetan histories of Buddhism in India and Tibet; translatorand reviser of Sanskrit texts; one of the foremost Tibetan experts in the K›lacakra andSecret Assembly (Guhyasam›ja) tantras; an important figure in the lineages of manytantric systems and author of liturgical commentaries who established his own school ofTibetan Buddhism (Tib: bu lugs);4 and one of the most prolific writers in Tibetan history,with his Collected Works comprising some thirty volumes. Of particular import to thestudy at hand, he is also the most prominent scholar in the field of Yoga Tantra that Tibethas produced.Butön’s literary style also warrants mentioning. He often employs a “cataloguing”technique in which he lists several opinions (of both Indian and Tibetan masters) on thetopic or point he is discussing, using the Tibetan term kha cig (“someone says” or “acertain scholar says”) to indicate each individual position. This provides at once a wealthof information and frustration: while in some cases Butön refutes or modifies a mistakenposition, in other cases he simply states the view and says it should be investigated, ormoves on without commenting on its veracity or fault. This style runs throughout the   4 D.S. Ruegg, The Life of Bu ston rin po che: With the Tibetan Text of the Bu ston rNam thar (Roma:Istituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente, 1966), pp. xi-xii. The view that Butön established aseparate school still has currency in contemporary Tibetan culture. Kushog Wangdi, a scholar of theSakya monastery just outside Gangtok, Sikkim, stated that there were five schools of TibetanBuddhism: the standard four (Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyü, and Geluk), to which he added a fifth, Butön’sBuluk school (personal communication, December, 1994)."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 8Ship for Launching onto the Ocean of Yoga Tantra as well as other texts on Yoga Tantrahe composed.Throughout this study, it is important to bear in mind that one cannot simply transposeTibetan systems and accounts of tantra back into India and presume that one is looking ata clear picture of the Indian state of affairs. However, Tibetan traditions and sources doprovide important clues concerning the contours of Indian tantric systems, and, whilethese at times may be sketchy, in many cases they are the only sources of informationavailable to us. Thus, with caution the use of such sources provides importantevidentiary materials for understanding Indian Buddhist tantra as well as illuminatinghow Tibetans understood, presented, and developed Indian tantric traditions in Tibet.The Compendium of PrinciplesThere are two extant Sanskrit manuscripts of the tantra, both from Nepal. GuiseppeTucci obtained a nineteenth-century Nepalese manuscript of the tantra, and in 1956David Snellgrove and John Brough discovered an Indian palm-leaf manuscript that theyidentified as a ninth or tenth-century work from Bihar, India.5 Snellgrove and LokeshChandra published a photographic reproduction of this manuscript,6 and Isshi Yamadaproduced a romanized Sanskrit version of this edition of the Compendium of Principleswith reference to Tibetan and Chinese translations.7 Kanjin Horiuchi produced a criticalromanized edition using both extant Sanskrit manuscripts as well as translated materialsin Chinese and Tibetan.8 Lokesh Chandra also published a Devanagari edition of   5 Lokesh Chandra and David Snellgrove, Sarva-tath›gata-tattva-saºgraha: Facsimile Reproduction of aTenth Century Sanskrit Manuscript from Nepal (New Delhi: Sharada Rani, 1981) p. 5.6 Chandra and Snellgrove, Facsimile Reproduction.7 Isshi Yamada, Sarva-tath›gata-tattva-saºgraha n›ma mah›y›na-sÒtra: A Critical Edition Based on theSanskrit Manuscript and Chinese and Tibetan Translations (New Delhi: Sharada Rani, 1981).8 Kanjin Horiuchi, ed., Shoe Kongßchßkyß no KenkyÒ, Bonpon Kßteihen Bonzßkan Taishß, 2 vols (KßyasanUniversity: Mikkyß Bunka KenkyÒjo, 1983)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Introduction 9Snellgrove’s manuscript that offers no improvement over Yamada’s romanized editionand in fact introduces textual errors.9The earliest extant translations of the Compendium of Principles are eighth-centuryChinese works.

What is the structure ofthe Compendium of Principles, and what are its contents?Buddhist Tantra: An IntroductionTantra as a Category TermAccording to Monier-Williams’ Sanskrit dictionary, the word “tantra” itself means“loom” or “warp.”25 It is employed in traditional Buddhist usage with much the samemeaning as the word “sÒtra”—the sense of a thread or something drawn out, and byextension a discourse. The term is discussed in several texts later classified as YogaTantra. In the ⁄rı Param›dya Tantra the term is described in this way: “Tantra isexplained as ‘continuum’.”26 Similarly, the VajraŸekhara Tantra says, “A tantra isexplained as ‘that which is continuous’.”27 The fourteenth-century Tibetan exegeteButön further delineates tantra as two types: tantras that are the “expressed meanings”and tantras that are the “expressive words.”28 The latter are the tantra-texts themselves,and the former are the meanings their words convey. Butön further subdivides tantras inthe sense of expressed meanings into causal tantras (rgyu’i rgyud), resultant tantras (’brasbu’i rgyud), and method tantras (thabs kyi rgyud), and his explanation of all the aboveusages of “tantra” includes the sense of continuum or continuation.29 As for tantras that   25 Sir Monier Monier-Williams, Sansk ̧it-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arrangedwith Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1899; Rpt:New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 1994), p. 436.26 rgyud ni rgyun zhes bya bar bshad/ (Butön Rinchendrup [Bu ston Rin chen grub], An ExtensiveExplanation of finandagarbha’s “Source of All Vajras”: A Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, rDo rje thams cad’byung ba’i rgya cher bshad pa yid bzhin nor bu, in Collected Works of Bu-ston, Part 11 (da) [Lhasa:Zhol Printing House, 1990; photographic reproduction Delhi: International Academy of Indian Culture,1968], 19a.2).27 rgyud ni rgyun chags zhes bya ste/ (Butön, Extensive Explanation, 18b.5).28 rgyud ni/ brjod bya don gyi rgyud dang/ rjod byed tshig gi rgyud gnyis (Butön, Extensive Explanation,18b.2).29 Butön, Extensive Explanation, 18b.2-19a.3."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 15are the expressive words (that is, the texts themselves), Butön explains that because thecollections of words that teach the meanings expressed are “connected and continuous”30they are tantras.We see in this explication of “tantra” the emphasis on the sense of continuity and/ orcontinuum. Thus, the word “tantra,” like “sÒtra,” comes to indicate a discourse and, byextension, a type of text. While “sÒtra” is used to denote a text of Buddha-speech fromthe earliest strata of Indian Buddhism through the development of Mah›y›na, works thatinclude the word “tantra” in their title almost always belong to a corpus of texts thatcontain the distinctive doctrines and practices that represent the last stage in thedevelopment of Indian Mah›y›na Buddhism. In traditional works, while the textsthemselves are termed “tantras,” this stage of Mah›y›na Buddhism is identified as atradition not by the word “tantra”31 but rather by the word “mantra” or the term “secretmantra” (Skt: guhya-mantra; Tib: gsang sngags; Chi: chen-yen mi-chiao; Jap: shingonmikkyß). However, modern scholarship has adopted the convention of using “tantra” as acategory term that refers to the vast and varied corpus of such texts and their relatedpractices.32 I will follow this convention of using “tantra” as a category (which includesthe use of the adjective “tantric”) since it is the established norm in academic discourse,but it is important to remember that this usage of the term “tantra” is a modern and non-traditional convention.   30 de nyid ston par byed pa’i sgra’i tshogs ’brel cing rgyun chags pas na/ rgyud (Butön, ExtensiveExplanation, 19a.3).31 Traditional scholarship does employ the word “tantra” in doxographical discussions categorizing tantrictexts.

It should be noted that in scholarship on East Asian Buddhismthe term “esoteric Buddhism” is often used instead of the term “tantric Buddhism.”"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 16The development of Buddhism over the centuries involved the development of a widevariety of doctrines and practices. At some point during the early centuries of thecommon era some Buddhist exegetes considered their systems different enough fromearlier doctrines and/ or practices to make a distinction between them. They employedthe term “vehicle” (Skt: y›na) and, based on their view of the differences in goals,methods, and doctrines, began to call their own traditions the “Great Vehicle”(mah›y›na) while referring to earlier traditions as the “Lesser Vehicle” (hınay›na).Early Indian tantric commentators situate tantra as a subcategory of Mah›y›na rather thanas a separate vehicle on the level of the pair Hınay›na and Mah›y›na. For example, theeighth-century exegete Buddhaguhya, in his Word Commentary on the ManifestEnlightenment of Vairocana Tantra, employs the term “mode of mantra” (Tib: sngags kyitshul; Skt: mantranaya) in contradistinction to the term “mode of the perfections” (Tib:pha rol tu phyin pa’i tshul; Skt: p›ramit›naya), which he uses for non-tantricMah›y›na.33 This is not a novel usage of these terms, however, as we find in theManifest Enlightenment of Vairocana Tantra itself, which dates to the middle of theseventh century,34 the terms “mode of secret mantra” (gsang sngags kyi tshul; *guhya-mantra-naya)35 and “mode of mantra practice” (*mantra-cary›-naya).36 Thus, in early   33 Hodge, “Considerations,“ p. 58.34 Hodge, “Considerations,” p. 65.35 rNam par snang mdzad chen po mngon par rdzogs par byang chub pa rnam par sprul pa byin gyis rlobpa shin tu rgyas pa mdo sde’i dbang po’i rgyal po zhes bya ba’i chos kyi rnam grangs,Mah›vairocan›bhisa ̇bodhivikurvit›dhi ̋ ̨h›na-vaipulyasÒtrendrar›ja-n›ma-dharmapary›ya,translated by ⁄ılendrabodhi and dPal brtsegs, P126 (Toh. 494), vol. 5, 240.4.6.

For example, during the eleventh andtwelfth centuries the tantric exegetes Advayavajra and Ratn›karaŸ›nti employ the term“mantra-y›na” (“mantra vehicle”) for tantra, in contradistinction to “p›ramit›-y›na”(“perfection vehicle”).37 Although this pair of terms represents the two divisions ofMah›y›na, they are referred to as “vehicles.” It is not clear whether “mantra vehicle”and “perfection vehicle” at that time were used with the status of “vehicle” on the orderof the Hınay›na/ Mah›y›na distinction. However, they were certainly moving towardsuch a meaning and beyond the earlier terms “mode of mantra” and “mode of theperfections” (which, to further confuse matters, Advayavajra and Ratn›karaŸ›nti alsouse).38It is clear, however, that tantra would come to be seen as a distinct and importantcategory of Buddhist practice. As David Snellgrove points out, with the use of the term“vajra-y›na” (“vajra-vehicle”) in India we find a shift to a self-conscious demarcationthat, while still considering tantra to be a form of Mah›y›na Buddhism, now elevates it toa status on the level of Hınay›na and Mah›y›na.39 It is odd for Vajray›na (that is, tantra),   37 de Jong, “A New History of Tantric Literature,” pp. 92-93.38 de Jong, “A New History of Tantric Literature,” pp. 92-93.39 Snellgrove, Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, pp. 129-130.

No single definition is broadenough to cover all cases of tantra and still retain much meaning, and many importantaspects of tantra, such as visualization, are also found in non-tantric Mah›y›na traditions.As a result, most attempts to define or outline tantra are polythetic in nature. Severalscholars have elucidated lists of features that characterize Buddhist tantra, with the caveatthat the list is not exhaustive and that not all the elements will be found in every tantrictext.40 I will briefly describe some of these characteristic elements.The proliferation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas found in Mah›y›na literature continuesin tantric literature. The clustering of deities arrayed in ma ̊ ̃alas—representations of theuniverse in enlightened form—is also a characteristic of tantra, the roots of which likely       We do, however, find the term “vajra-y›na” used in an eighth-century Chinese text written by theIndian tantric master Amoghavajra.

In conjunction with various specificallytantric techniques, practitioners recreate themselves as deities. This practice, usuallytermed “deity yoga” (lha’i rnal ’byor, devat›-yoga), is one of the unique features oftantra (although we must bear in mind that it is not found in every instance of tantra).42 Iwill discuss deity yoga and its importance in the Compendium of Principles in moredetail in chapter three (see p. 176).In addition to deity yoga (and often in conjunction with it), tantric practice involvesmany other characteristic elements, among which is the employment of mantras.Mantras, which may be short (a few syllables) or several sentences long, are recited to aspecific effect (and as such the word “mantra” is sometimes translated as “spell”). Whilemantras are an important element of tantra, they are also found in pre-tantric Mah›y›natexts, where they are often called dh›ra ̊ı and are employed for mundane or practicalpurposes such as protection from various harms, stopping storms, causing rain, and soforth.43 The use of mudr›s—generally speaking, a gesture (or symbol) that “seals” thepractitioner’s identity as the deity through symbolizing various of the deity’s attitudesand attributes—is also a common feature of tantra.

Finally, the use of desire and sexual yoga, as well as the use of violenceand other afflictive emotions, is often found in tantric practices.44These are some of the techniques employed in tantra that are said to distinguish it fromnon-tantric Mah›y›na Buddhism. While there was a long history of rituals in Mah›y›naBuddhism alongside the philosophical aspects that have been emphasized in westernscholarship, in tantra ritual moves from the periphery to the center, and innovativemethods of practice are also introduced, as I will discuss in chapter three (see p. 173 ff).We also find the metaphor of coronation as a king and the exercise of dominion that isone of tantra’s central features.45 While this brief description of tantra is admittedlylacking and incomplete, it provides some background for topics I will discuss later.Indian Cultural ContextRonald Davidson has written a groundbreaking monograph on the Indian culturalcontext in which tantric Buddhism developed. He examines medieval India after thebreak-up of the Gupta Empire, focusing on the period between the sixth and twelfthcenturies. This period witnessed the feudalization of India, with the rise of regionalcenters and military adventurism in the absence of a central imperial power. Alsocharacteristic of this period was the apotheosis of these new rulers of petty kingdoms,their reliance on new sources of legitimatization such as the discourse of violenceemployed by emerging ⁄aivite sects, and so forth.46   44 For a more extensive discussion of tantra, see for example Snellgrove, Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, vol. 1,pp. 117-303.45 Ronald Davidson argues that the exercise of dominion is the central metaphor of tantra (Davidson, IndianEsoteric Buddhism, p. 2).46 Davidson, Indian Esoteric Buddhism, pp. 2-4."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 21In terms of the effects such cultural changes had on Buddhism, Davidson enumeratesthe following: the loss of guild-based patronage; the contraction in the number ofBuddhist institutions, and their concentration in the northern and extreme southern areasof India; the decline in women’s participation in Buddhism; the development ofphilosophical skepticism and “non-Buddhist epistemological axioms”; and the rise oflarge monastic institutions.47 It is within this milieu—both of the broader Indian cultureand of the Indian Buddhist sub-culture—that tantric Buddhism developed.48Tantric DoxographyBefore discussing the Compendium of Principles and other tantras in more detail, abrief discussion of tantric doxography is necessary. Texts now classified as tantras beganto be produced at the beginning of the seventh century, but the first Indian doxographicaldiscussions of tantra did not arise until the middle of the eighth century in northern India.Furthermore, this might represent a regional development, as south Indian traditions ofapproximately the same period do not categorize the tantras.49 Thus, it appears that formore than one hundred years tantras were not classified or stratified. Moreover, theevidence cited above also suggests that the conception of “tantra” as a distinct Buddhisttradition did not emerge until the middle of the eighth century at the earliest.Before presenting doxographical strategies employed by Indian exegetes, I must statethat, although both traditional and modern scholars have categorized Buddhist tantras,these schemes seem rather artificial at best for the earliest strata of texts. Studying thevarious early tantric texts themselves—those that would later be classified under therubrics of Action Tantra (bya rgyud, kriy›-tantra) and Performance Tantra (spyod rgyud,cary›-tantra)—is necessary.

The category to which it is assigned—YogaTantra—does not appear until fifty or seventy-five years after the tantra’s production.Therefore, when referring to the early tantra texts, I will attempt to avoid using termssuch as Yoga Tantra with a sense of a monolithic tradition that emerged at the same timeas the tantras themselves. I will, however, use doxographical category terms whenreferring to subsequent traditions as they became consolidated in India and, later, as theyare further standardized in Tibet.In an early Indian doxography the eighth-century author Buddhaguhya mentions threetypes of tantra in his Commentary on the Manifest Enlightenment of Vairocana Tantra:Action Tantra (bya ba’i rgyud, kriy›-tantra), Yoga Tantra (rnal ’byor gyi rgyud, yoga-tantra), and Dual Tantra (gnyis ka’i rgyud, ubhaya-tantra), a special category for theManifest Enlightenment of Vairocana Tantra that is called such because it containselements of both Yoga Tantra and Action Tantra.50 Vil›savajra (aka Varabodhi), anotherimportant tantric exegete of roughly the same period, mentions only the three divisions of   50 Buddhaguhya, rNam par snang mdzad mngon par byang chub pa rnam par sprul pa’i byin gyis brlabskyi rgyud chen po’i bshad pa, *Vairocan›bhisambodhivikurvit›dhi ̋ ̨h›namah›tantrabh› ̋ya, P3490(Toh. 2663A), vol. 77, 231.2.3-231.3.1.

Sanskrit manuscripts have often been lost, particularly forthe earlier tantric works. Additionally, because tantras were often composed/ compiled instages, settling a date for the earliest version of a text that we have now only in its finalform is problematic.

He begins with theuse of spells employed for practical purposes in various Mah›y›na sÒtras.59 Thesedevelop further in the earliest tantric phase and include rituals for variouspurposes—controlling nature (avoiding storms, causing rain), warding off evil (robbers,poisonous snakes and the like), and so forth60—combined with the recitation of spells,meditation on Buddhist images, and so forth.61 It is not clear exactly when these tantraswere produced.

According to Snellgrove, the employment of“families” as an organizing structure represents the process by which originally non-Buddhist deities were admitted into the Buddhist fold.63 In the early strata of tantra wefind deities that populate the ma ̊ ̃alas organized into three families, at the head of eachof which is a leading figure: the Tath›gata family, at the head of which is ⁄›kyamuni(sometimes represented by MañjuŸrı); the lotus family, headed by AvalokiteŸvara; andthe vajra family, led by Vajrap› ̊i.64 Initially a hierarchy obtained between these threefamilies. The Tath›gata family, consisting of traditional Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, washeld to be the highest. Below it was the lotus family, comprising peaceful deities of non-Buddhist origin. Lowest of the three families was the vajra family and its cast ofwrathful deities, also of non-Buddhist origin.65   62 Matsunaga, “A History of Tantric Buddhism,” p. 173.63 Snellgrove, Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, vol. 1, p. 191.64 Snellgrove, “Categories of Buddhist Tantras,” p. 1364.65 Snellgrove, “Categories of Buddhist Tantras,” p. 1364."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 27Provenance of the Manifest Enlightenment of Vairocana TantraThe Manifest Enlightenment of Vairocana represents the next stage in the developmentof Indian Buddhist tantra.66 It contains a clear soteriological thrust that is not readilyapparent in many earlier tantras, in which the emphasis is on practical aims such asprotection from various misfortunes and so forth.67 Moreover, we find also the inclusionof specifically Buddhist doctrinal content in its first chapter, a lengthy presentation of thenature of the mind that strongly reflects the influence of the Yogic Practice School (rnal’byor spyod pa, yog›c›ra; aka Mind-Only School, sems tsam, cittam›tra).68Additionally, this text demonstrates the systematic organization of rituals around thethree secrets of body, speech, and mind.69 In terms of Buddha-family structure, theManifest Enlightenment of Vairocana Tantra embodies a three-family system.70Significantly, however, in the Manifest Enlightenment of Vairocana Tantra we find thebeginning of the shift from ⁄›kyamuni as the central figure of the ma ̊ ̃ala to Vairocanaas the central figure.In terms of later doxographies, the Manifest Enlightenment of Vairocana iscategorized under the rubric of Performance Tantra (spyod rgyud, cary›-tantra), althoughthe terms “upa-tantra” and “up›ya-tantra” are also used.

This indicates the transitional status of these texts in Indian tantricBuddhist development from three-family to five-family systems, which I will discuss inchapter three (see p. 200 ff).

As David Germano and   101 Snellgrove, “Categories of Buddhist Tantras,” p. 1364.102 Traditional scholarship has explicitly focused on the shift away from external rites and to internalcontemplation in defining the Compendium of Principles and the corpus of tantras related to it."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 36others have argued, these developments were initially seen as extensions of the texts thatwould be included under the rubric of Yoga Tantra—they were “great” or “supercharged”Yoga Tantra. As a result, the term “Mah›yoga” (“Great” or “Super Yoga”) was used toclassify them (at least in some quarters).I will discuss Mah›yoga, and particularly its relationship with the Compendium ofPrinciples and its family of texts, in detail in chapter four (pp. 219-291, and especiallypp. 236-289 for the relationship between Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga), so I will makeonly brief remarks here. Practices involving ritualized sex and violence found in theCompendium of Principles and texts of its ilk are expanded and amplified in the corpus oftexts classified as Mah›yoga. Two of the most important of these texts are the SecretAssembly Tantra (Guhyasam›ja Tantra) and Secret Nucleus Tantra (GuhyagarbhaTantra). Amoghavajra discusses the Secret Assembly as the fifteenth text in his synopsisof the eighteen texts of the VajraŸekhara cycle.103 Matsunaga concludes that thisrepresents a nascent form of the tantra as we have it today in Sanskrit, Tibetan, andChinese, and that this early version must have been in existence in India before 746CE.104 The Secret Nucleus is likely a later work that dates to the latter half of the eighthcentury.105In terms of Buddha families, the Secret Assembly Tantra refers to both five familiesand six families; this apparently transitional status between five- and six-family systemsalso suggests a relatively early date for the tantra. In some of the Mah›yoga tantrasVairocana and his Tath›gata family are at the center of the ma ̊ ̃ala, as is the case withthe Compendium of Principles and most of the texts classified as Yoga Tantra.

This shift to wrathful deities is further developed in later tantras, and indicatesthat the Secret Nucleus Tantra is a later composition than the Secret Assembly Tantra.There are Indian commentaries on the Secret Nucleus preserved in Tibetan translationand attributed to the Indian exegetes Vil›savajra and Buddhaguhya, places the tantra’sproduction sometime during the eighth century.

Amoghavajra also does not refer to thecategory “Mah›yoga”—or indeed to any doxographical classifications. Thus, theconstruction of “mah›yoga” as a category of tantra, and indeed tantric doxography itself,must be seen as a later development, and perhaps one that represents only regional Indiantradition.The tantras grouped together under the rubric of Mah›yoga reflect the continueddevelopment of extreme or radical practices found in inchoate form in the Compendiumof Principles and the family of texts that developed out of it. In particular, we find moreadvanced forms of wrathful practices and sexual practices (for instance, the SecretAssembly Tantra was taught when the Supramundane Victor was residing in the femalevagina).106 It seems unlikely that the introduction of practices involving the subtle bodyand the manipulation of life-energies at internal psycho-physical centers (and the subtlelevels of consciousness associated with them) occurred with these tantras. Certainly thelater commentarial traditions include such practices, but the evidence suggests that theearliest traditions of the tantras themselves do not.   106 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 193."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 38Yoginı Tantras and Highest Yoga TantraMah›yoga constitutes the first of the three inner vehicles in nine-vehicle systems.However, fourfold doxographical systems subsume texts such as the Secret AssemblyTantra under the rubric of Highest Yoga Tantra (Tib: bla med [rnal ’byor] rgyud; Skt:anuttara-[yoga]-tantra). Again, this demonstrates the artifice involved withdoxographical constructs. A further example of this is a group of tantras sometimesreferred to as yoginı tantras, of which there is some overlap with texts classified asMah›yoga in nine-vehicle doxographies and as Highest Yoga Tantra in fourfoldclassification systems. The continued development of practices and doctrines found inMah›yoga, and particularly those involving wrathful deities, sexual yoga, and the subtlebody, resulted in tantras that would eventually be classified as Highest Yoga Tantra. Theantinomian bent of the violence and sex in these tantras reflects their origins outsidemonastic institutions, in the traditions of the “Perfected” (Skt: siddha) yogi cults (andperhaps also local deity cults).107 The earliest known yoginı tantra is the Yoga of theEquality of all Buddhas,108 which is included in Amoghavajra’s summary of theVajraŸekhara Yoga cycle and so dates, at least in an early stage of its development, to themiddle of the eighth century (and probably earlier).109 Furthermore, in the latter half ofthe eighth century Vil›savajra quotes from the Laghusa ̇vara, a Yoginı Tantra, in hiscommentaries on the Litany of Names of MañjuŸrı and the Secret Essence Tantra,110 so   107 Davidson, Indian Esoteric Buddhism, pp. 294-299.108 Giebel reconstructs the Sanskrit as Sarvabuddhasam›yoga ̃›kinısa ̇varaj›layoga (Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 180, n. 197).109 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” pp. 180-181, n. 197 & p. 193.

One of the two surviving Sanskrit manuscriptsconsists of 150 palm-leaf pages; since the text is written on both the front and back ofeach palm leaf, it totals 300 sides in all.116 The Tibetan translation by Rinchen Zangpoand ⁄raddh›karavarman as it appears in the Peking edition of the Kangyur spans some260 folio sides. The Chinese translation of the tantra in its final form by Shih-hu(D›nap›la) consists of thirty fascicles.117An introduction, a body, and an appended section constitute the Compendium ofPrinciples. The introduction describes the qualities of Vairocana—the teacher of thetantra—as well as the audience, location, and time of the teaching. It also includesdescriptions of Mah›vairocana and Samantabhadra. The body of the tantra consists ofthe emanation and description of five cycles of ma ̊ ̃alas as well as their respective rites.These are arranged in four sections, referred to in the commentarial tradition as the Vajra-Element Section (Tib: rdo rje dbyings kyi dum bu; Skt: *vajradh›tu-kha ̊ ̃a),118 theConquest over the Three Worlds Section (Tib: ’jig rten gsum las rnam par rgyal ba’idum bu or khams gsum rnam par rgyal ba’i dum bu; Skt: *trilokavijaya-kha ̊ ̃a), theTaming Transmigrators Section (Tib: ’gro ba ’dul ba’i dum bu; Skt: *jagadvinaya-   116 Snellgrove, Facsimile Reproduction, p. 7.

I willdiscuss the Supplementary Tantra and the Second Supplementary Tantra below (see p. 69ff).Each section consists of a number of chapters, which total twenty-six in all. The firstsection spans five chapters, and the third, fourth, and fifth sections contain four chapterseach. The anomalous second section, which unlike the other three sections that comprisethe body of the tantra contains two ma ̊ ̃ala cycles rather than one (I will discuss thissection in more detail below, p. 77 ff), encompasses nine chapters. In terms of length,however, the first section is the longest. This reflects both the introductory material thatoccurs only at the beginning of the text and the fact that the ma ̊ ̃alas in the first section   119 These section titles appear in the Indian exegete Amoghavajra’s Chinese work summarizing the eighteentexts of the VajraŸekhara Yoga system, so they were current by the middle of the eighth century(Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” pp. 127, 141, 154, and 158). finandagarbha, a prolific Indianauthor of the ninth century, also employs these same section titles in his Illumination of the Principles(P3333, vol. 71, 146.5.7-146.5.8; 142.3.6; 144.1.3).In the tantra itself these sections are identified, respectively, as the “Manifest Realization of theGreat Vehicle of All Tath›gatas Great King of Procedures (de bzhin gshegs pa thams cad kyi theg pachen po’i mngon par rtogs pa zhes bya ba’i rtog pa’i rgyal po chen po,sarvatath›gatamah›y›n›bhisamayan›mamah›kalpar›ja),” the “Vajra Pledge of All Tath›gatas GreatKing of Procedures” (de bzhin gshegs pa thams cad kyi rdo rje’i dam tshig zhes bya ba’i rtog pa’i rgyalpo chen po, sarvatath›gatavajrasamayan›mamah›kalpar›ja), the “Doctrine Pledge of All Tath›gatasGreat King of Procedures” (de bzhin gshegs pa thams cad kyi chos kyi dam tshig zhes bya ba’i rtog pa’irgyal po chen po, sarvatath›gatadharmasamayan›mamah›kalpar›ja), and the “Action Pledge of AllTath›gatas Great King of Procedures” (de bzhin gshegs pa thams cad kyi las kyi dam tshig zhes bya ba’irtog pa’i rgyal po chen po, sarvatath›gatakarmasamayan›mamah›kalpar›ja)."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 42as well as the various rites associated with them serve as prototypes for the ma ̊ ̃alas andrites that occur in the subsequent sections. Thus, the explanations in the first section aremore detailed and thorough, as they are to be carried over to the explanations insubsequent sections, which become increasingly more abbreviated.Divisions in the Compendium of Principles primarily come in sets of four. Each of thefour sections of the tantra is associated with a central Buddha figure, a Buddha family,and an aspect of enlightened expression. The first section is associated with Vairocana(the central figure in Yoga Tantra as a whole), the Tath›gata family (Tib: de bzhin gshegspa’i rigs; Skt: tath›gata-kula), and enlightened body; the second, with Ak ̋obhya, thevajra family (Tib: rdo rje’i rigs; Skt: vajra-kula), and enlightened mind; the third, withAmit›yus (aka LokeŸvarar›ja and, in later traditions, Amit›bha), the doctrine family (orlotus family; chos kyi or padma’i rigs, dharma- or padma-kula), and enlightened speech;and the fourth, with Ratnasambhava, the jewel family (rin po che’i rigs, ratna-kula), andenlightened action.There are also four main types of ma ̊ ̃alas and four types of mudr›s found in theCompendium of Principles, with one type of ma ̊ ̃ala and one type of mudr› beingemphasized in each of the four sections of the tantra (although all four types of ma ̊ ̃alaand all four types of mudr› are found in each section). Before discussing the individualma ̊ ̃alas and rites of the Compendium of Principles, I will make a few comments onma ̊ ̃alas and mudr›s.In general, ma ̊ ̃alas are representations of the state of enlightenment, and compriseboth the deities who represent various aspects of the enlightened state and the multi-chambered, multi-walled, multi-storied palaces in which they reside. The four types of"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 43ma ̊ ̃alas found in the Compendium of Principles are great ma ̊ ̃alas120 (dkyil ’khor chenpo, mah›-ma ̊ ̃ala), retention ma ̊ ̃alas (gzungs dkyil, dh›ra ̊ı-ma ̊ ̃ala),121 doctrinema ̊ ̃alas (chos dkyil, dharma-ma ̊ ̃ala), and action ma ̊ ̃alas (las dkyil, karma-ma ̊ ̃ala).122 There are two additional types of ma ̊ ̃alas presented in each section of theCompendium of Principles, the four-mudr› ma ̊ ̃ala and the single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃ala.However, these are condensed versions of the four central ma ̊ ̃alas, and their rites areabbreviated versions of the extensive rites of the four ma ̊ ̃alas. According to Butön theCompendium of Principles has a total of 213 ma ̊ ̃alas,123 although it is not at all clearhow he arrived at this figure.The deities in the great ma ̊ ̃alas appear in physical form. The deities in the retentionma ̊ ̃alas appear as their respective hand-symbols, such as a vajra, bell, hook, noose, andso forth.124 In the doctrine ma ̊ ̃alas of the Compendium of Principles the central deity isin physical form while the other deities take the form of their respective hand-symbols ontheir respective seats, with the deity in the center of its hand-symbol. In the action   120 This fourfold typology of ma ̊ ̃alas is taken from Butön’s fourteenth-century Tibetan exegesis, althoughthe Indian tantric master Amoghavajra employs the same categorization in his eighth-century Chinesework on the eighteen texts of the VajraŸekhara cycle. In the text of the Compendium of Principles itselfthe ma ̊ ̃alas are identified by their individual names and these four categories are not mentioned.121 This type of ma ̊ ̃ala is also called “pledge ma ̊ ̃ala” (dam tshig gi dkyil ’khor, samaya-ma ̊ ̃ala) or“vajra ma ̊ ̃ala” (rdo rje’i dkyil ’khor, vajra-ma ̊ ̃ala). While the Compendium of Principles itselfidentifies this type of ma ̊ ̃ala as a vajra ma ̊ ̃ala, Tibetan commentarial traditions refer to them asretention ma ̊ ̃alas. The eighth-century Indian tantric master Amoghavajra also refers to them asretention ma ̊ ̃alas (Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 132).122 Each section of the Compendium of Principles actually includes two additional ma ̊ ̃alas—the four-mudr› and single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃alas. However, the four ma ̊ ̃alas just mentioned are the primaryma ̊ ̃alas; the four-mudr› and single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃alas are less elaborate and the rites associated withthem are abbreviated versions of the full rites employed in the four ma ̊ ̃alas.123 Butön, Ship, 26a.4.124 In some Chinese translations of texts related to the Compendium of Principles the deities appear infemale form, holding their respective hand-symbols (Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” pp. 133-134, n. 28)."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 44ma ̊ ̃alas the five Buddhas appear in physical form while the other deities appear in theform of female deities such as the offering goddesses and so forth.The four-mudr› and single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃alas that appear in each section are consensedversions of the four ma ̊ ̃alas just described. The central figure in the four-mudr›ma ̊ ̃alas is one of the five Buddhas, who is surrounded by the other four Buddhas in theform of mudr›s (and hence the name “four-mudr› ma ̊ ̃ala”). There are five four-mudr›ma ̊ ̃alas in each of the four sections of the Compendium of Principles, with each of theBuddhas of the five families at the center of his own four-mudr› ma ̊ ̃ala, surrounded bya distinctive set of four mudr›s (vajras, lotuses, hooks, and so forth). The single-mudr›ma ̊ ̃alas consist of a single deity on a moon-disc in the center of the ma ̊ ̃ala.In the strictest sense mudr›s are symbolic gestures made with the hands. However,they often entail postures of the entire body, such as the lean of the torso or tilt of thehead, and sometimes involve movement of the hands, arms, and so forth. Basically, themudr› of a deity is the embodiment of the characteristics of enlightenment that the deityrepresents, and constructing a deity’s mudr› means taking on those characteristics. Theliteral meaning of “mudr›” (Tib: phyag rgya) is “seal,” and relates to official seals usedby the government. An official’s seal on a document mandates that the instructionscontained therein cannot be transgressed. Similarly, “sealing” oneself as a deity meansthat one does not pass beyond visualizing oneself as that deity and thinking and actingaccordingly.The four types of mudr›s found in the Compendium of Principles are great mudr›s(Tib: phyag rgya chen po, abbreviated to phyag chen; Skt: mah›-mudr›), pledge mudr›s(dam tshig gi phyag rgya, abbreviated to dam rgya; samaya-mudr›), doctrine mudr›s(chos kyi phyag rgya, abbreviated to chos rgya; dharma-mudr›), and action mudr›s (laskyi phyag rgya, abbreviated to las rgya; karma-mudr›). Great mudr›s differ from theother three types of mudr›s in that their “construction” entails not physical postures but"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 45rather creating oneself as the deity through visualization itself. There is a proliferation ofmudr›s in the Compendium of Principles not seen in prior or subsequent developments ofIndian Buddhist tantric,125 for reasons that are as yet unclear.126Types of mantra represent another set of four employed in the tantra. The four typesof mantras appear to be mantras (Tib: sngags), essence mantras (snying po, h ̧daya),knowledge mantras (rig pa, vidy›), and mudr›s. Though this last term in general refers togestures, in some instances in the tantra it refers to a type of mantra, as Snellgrove hasnoted.127 While I have not found commentaries linking the four types of mantras withcorresponding ma ̊ ̃alas or mudr›s, they are important components of the Compendiumof Principles.The Tibetan translation of the Compendium of Principles has an additional structuralcomponent: the text is divided into nine parts (bam po) of roughly equal length. The nineparts usually break the text at logical points (such as the ends of chapters) and so mightrepresent divisions based on content. However, they also likely reflect the physicalcharacteristics of the Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts from which the Tibetan translationwas made, as the nine parts probably represent nine bundles into which the palm-leafmanuscript was tied for ease of transport and storage.The tantra most likely represents a compilation of several shorter texts (or partsthereof) in existence during the middle to late seventh century. The beginning of thetantra in particular appears to be an amalgamation of seemingly unrelated pieces that   125 When the topic of Yoga Tantra is broached with Tibetan lamas, their initial response most often is tocomment on the large number of mudr›s in Yoga Tantra.126 Ronald Davidson has suggested that the proliferation of mudr›s in Indian royal initiation rites found inthe Dharmottara Pur› ̊a and the Agni Pur› ̊a may be the source of the proliferation of mudr›s in theCompendium of Principles (Ronald Davidson, personal communication, 4 November 2000).

In addition, the narrative ofthe Bodhisattva Vajrap› ̊i’s subjugation of MaheŸvara with which the second section ofthe tantra opens, and the anomalous structure of the second section itself (two cycles ofma ̊ ̃alas rather than a single cycle), reveal what was likely an independent text (or texts)incorporated into the Compendium of Principles. Finally, the fifth section of the tantra,consisting of a Supplementary Tantra (Tib: rgyud phyi ma; Skt: uttara-tantra) and aSecond Supplementary Tantra (rgyud phyi ma’i phyi ma; uttarottara-tantra), alsorepresents appendices added to the text after the compilation of the beginning materialand the four sections of the body. I will discuss each of these components of the textbelow.All the extant versions of the Compendium of Principles in Sanskrit, Tibetan, andChinese consist of a combination of prose and verse. Although the text is extensive, thestyle is often terse. As is characteristic of Buddhist tantras in general, details are oftenomitted from descriptions of ma ̊ ̃alas, meditations, and other rites and activities.Buddhist traditions hold that tantras are purposely truncated. Such abbreviation restrictsaccess to all but those qualified by initiation and guidance from a qualified teacher and soforth. Butön explains the secrecy of tantra this way:128In order to stop [people] from becoming involved with tantras of their ownaccord, tantras are set forth in an incomplete way, in an unclear way, and withconfusion.The necessity of filling out the missing details, clarifying what is unclear, and so forthcompelled the composition in India of exegetical literature of various types.

Then through a series of steps he visualizes his tongue as a vajra on alotus, and thereby blesses his speech and gives it powerful ritual efficacy. He similarlyvisualizes his hands as vajras (and each individual finger as a single-pointed vajra); thisgives the actions performed by his hands powerful ritual efficacy. There follows anextensive and thorough series of practices to secure the area where the ma ̊ ̃ala will beconstructed and the rite will be performed. This includes visualizations in combinationwith the construction of various mudr›s and the recitation of various mantras to drive outobstructive entities from the environs of the rite. In this preliminary phase of the riteeach of the ten directions are secured at least once.These preliminary practices, which are not even mentioned in the Compendium ofPrinciples, presuppose that the reader possesses a body of ritual knowledge necessary tofill in required material that is absent from the tantra’s description of the rite. Suchknowledge would likely be gained from familiarity with other tantras, other rites, and soforth, as well as from one’s own teacher (that is, from oral tradition). Thus, the brevityand truncation of much of the Compendium of Principles (and Buddhist tantras ingeneral) must be set within a larger context of assumed knowledge and a culture in whichmuch requisite information was still transmitted primarily, and sometimes exclusively,orally.finandagarbha’s Rite of the Vajradh›tu Great Ma ̊ ̃ala: Source of All Vajrasrepresents an attempt to commit to writing the complete rite—the terse and incompletedescription found in the Compendium of Principles filled out with the missing but   132 Compendium of Principles, P112, vol. 4, 229.3.1.133 This presentation is drawn from finandagarbha, Rite of the Vajradh›tu Great Ma ̊ ̃ala, P3339, vol. 74,3.1.1-3.1.5."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 49requisite parts drawn from other texts (both written and oral). However, as Butön’smammoth 700-side commentary on finandagarbha’s Source of All Vajras attests, suchtexts are never complete, nor are such bodies of knowledge closed.The Tantra’s IntroductionThe Compendium of Principles begins, as do almost all texts claiming to have beenspoken by a Buddha (or elicited by and/ or confirmed by a Buddha), with the familiarrefrain: “Thus have I heard at one time: ... ”.134 The introduction then continues with thestandard pentad of excellences (Tib: phun sum tshogs pa lnga) that serve as the criteriaby which a work is considered to be an authentic Buddha-voiced text (Tib: sangs rgyaskyi bka’; Skt: buddha-vacana): the teacher, location, audience, time, and teaching.Vairocana is identified as the teacher of the tantra. A description of the Aka ̊i ̋ ̨ha PureLand135—the location of the teaching—follows a rather lengthy list of Vairocana’sattributes. The audience is described as 990,000,000 Mah›sattva-Bodhisattvas, of whicheight are identified by name: the Bodhisattva-Mah›sattvas Vajrap› ̊i, Avalokiteshvara,fik›Ÿagarbha, Vajramu ̋ ̨i, MañjuŸrı, Sahacittotp›dadharmacakrapravartin, Gaganagañja,and Sarvam›rabalapramardin. In addition there are also Tath›gatas136 as numerous as the   134 Skt: evam may› ŸrÒtam ekasmin samaya; Tib: ’di skad bdag gis thos pa dus gcig na.135 The location is more specifically the abode of the king of the gods of Akani ̋ ̨ha.136 I am leaving untranslated the Sanskrit term “tath›gata” (and its Tibetan translation equivalent de bzhingshegs pa). It is sometimes translated as “one gone thus” or “thus-gone one.” The Indian exegete⁄›kyamitra explains the Sanskrit term “tath›gata” in this way, in the context of describing theTath›gata Vairocana:Because of realizing (Tib: thugs su chud pa, Skt: *adhigama) reality (chos nyid,dharmat›) in exactly the way (de bzhin du, tath›) previous Buddhas realized [it,Vairocana] is a Buddha, that is, a One Gone Thus (de bzhin gshegs pa, tath›gata),because “gone” (gshegs pa, gata) means “realize” [and hence tath›gata means “realizes(reality) in exactly the way (previous Buddhas realized it)”].

The occasion when Vairocana wasresiding in Akani ̋ ̨ha surrounded by this audience indicates the time of the teaching, thefourth of the five excellences.The introduction then elaborates further on the host of Tath›gatas present in theaudience in this way:137Furthermore, it is thus: the bodies of these limitless, innumerable Tath›gatasappear together in Jambudvıpa, completely filling it like sesame seeds [fill asesame pod]. Also, from each Tath›gata’s body innumerable, limitlessBuddha-fields appear.Here we find an expression of the proliferation of Buddha-fields (also called Pure Lands)found in Mah›y›na literature—and particularly in Pure Land texts and some of thevisionary Perfection of Wisdom texts. While the use of the sesame simile occurs againjust below in the Compendium of Principles—at the beginning of the enlightenmentnarrative that is such a crucial feature of the tantra138—here its presence seems ratherabrupt. It is possible that this represents material added later to the Compendium ofPrinciples, or material added from a source other than that of the description ofVairocana’s qualities, the audience, and so forth.

The longdescription of Vairocana’s qualities is situated within the context of the five excellences.It not only distinguishes the salient features of Vairocana, the teacher of the tantra, but italso indicates the location and audience: Vairocana was residing in the abode of the kingof the gods of Akani ̋ ̨ha, accompanied by 999,000,000 Bodhisattvas. Within this there iseven a sub-description of Akani ̋ ̨ha, but this too is in a particular context—the locationof the teaching—and so relates to both the material that comes before it and the materialthat follows it.In contrast to the litany of Vairocana’s qualities at the beginning of the text, the longdescription of Mah›vairocana (which spans more than one and a half folio sides) is notset in any context; it is simply a description.

It is also possible thatthe description of Samantabhadra’s qualities represents a later (or at least separate)development inserted into the text to expand on the references to Samantabhadra in thesections on the five manifest enlightenments and the generaton of the Vajradh›tuMa ̊ ̃ala.

As I will argue in chapter three, theramifications of this short query posed to the Bodhisattva Sarv›rthasiddhi by all theBuddhas are far-ranging not only for the Compendium of Principles and the corpus oftexts later classified as Yoga Tantra but also for the establishment of tantric Buddhismitself and its very claim as an authentic Buddhist development.The Tath›gatas’ response to Sarv›rthasiddhi’s question and the dialogue that followspresents the process of the five manifest enlightenments (Tib. mngon par byang chub palnga, usually abbreviated to mngon byang lnga; Skt: pañc›bhisambodhi)—the process bywhich the Bodhisattva Sarv›rthasiddhi becomes enlightened. This is the foundationalpractice set forth in the Compendium of Principles, as well as many of the texts it directlyspawned. Furthermore, it can be viewed as the sine qua non of Buddhist tantric practicesubsequent to the Compendium of Principles. I will discuss this in more detail below (seep. 176 ff) but will summarize it here.The Tath›gatas instruct Sarv›rthasiddhi to examine and meditate on his own mind andto repeat the mantra o ̇ citta-prativedha ̇ karomi (o ̇ I perform penetration of themind). The Bodhisattva responds that he sees what he has realized as a moon-disc at hisheart. The structure of the Tath›gatas instructing the Bodhisattva in a specific meditativepractice (which includes a specific mantra to recite) is employed for the four subsequentmanifest enlightenments as well.This is the first of the five manifest enlightenments. Commentarial traditions call this“manifest enlightenment through examination of the mind” and identify it with themirror-like wisdom (from among the five aspects of a Buddha’s wisdom) and the BuddhaAk ̋obhya, head of the vajra family.152   152 Butön, Ship, 7b.4-7b.5."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 58The narrative continues as the Tath›gatas explain to Sarv›rthasiddhi that this mind hehas just realized the nature of is naturally luminous, and that it is transformed accordingto how it is trained or cultivated, just like a white cloth changes when it is dyed. Theythen instruct him to generate the mind of enlightenment, and provide him with a mantrawith which to do so. The Bodhisattva reports that he sees a second moon disc.153 This isthe manifest enlightenment arisen from generating the mind of enlightenment, and isidentified with the wisdom of equality and Ratnasambhava of the jewel family.154Next, the Tath›gatas direct Sarv›rthasiddhi to manifest the essence of allTath›gatas—the all-good (samantabhadra) mind generation—and to stabilize it throughvisualizing a vajra on the moon-disc and reciting a specific mantra. The Bodhisattvareports back that he sees a vajra on the moon-disc at his heart. This is the manifestenlightenment arisen from a stable vajra, and is identified with the wisdom of individualanalysis and Amit›bha of the lotus (or doctrine) family.155In the fourth manifest enlightenment all tathagatas instruct the BodhisattvaSarv›rthasiddhi to stabilize further the mind he has been developing, and they bless himand consecrate him with the name “Vajradh›tu.” The Bodhisattva follows theirinstructions for meditation and recitation of another mantra, and reports that he sees allTath›gatas’ bodies as himself. This is the manifest enlightenment through having a vajranature, and is identified with the wisdom of achieving activities and Amoghasiddhi of theaction family. This is the manifest enlightenment through having a vajra-nature.156   153 There is debate within commentarial traditions on this point. According to Butön, Buddhaguhya and⁄›kyamitra assert that in the first manifest enlightenment the moon appears as a crescent moon and thatthis is then completed in the second manifest enlightenment. finandagarbha, following the explanatoryVajraŸekhara Tantra, says there are two individual moon-discs (Butön, Ship, 8b.1-8b.4).154 Butön, Ship, 8b.4.155 Butön, Ship, 9a.4.156 Butön, Ship, 10a.1."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 59In the fifth and final manifest enlightenment all Tath›gatas instruct the Bodhisattva inanother meditation and mantra.

Furthermore, it is under this namethat he leaves Akani ̋ ̨ha and travels to the peak of Mt. Meru. However, after arrivingthere and being joined by the Buddhas at the heads of the four Buddha families,Vajradh›tu is referred to as Vairocana. The name “Vajradh›tu” does not appear again inthe body of the tantra. In fact, it appears only three more times in the entire text: once inthe Supplement (rgyud phyi ma, uttara-tantra) and twice in the Second Supplement(rgyud phyi ma’i phyi ma, uttarottara-tantra).

However, the name Vajradh›tu is used rather than ⁄›kyamuni.I will detail the generation and arrangement of the Vajradh›tu Great Ma ̊ ̃ala below(see p. 72). Here, the disjunctions just discussed likely indicate yet again the ratherpiecemeal compilation of the beginning of the Compendium of Principles. It is quitepossible that the narrative of the generation of the Vajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala existed as aseparate entity that was incorporated into the Compendium of Principles. How early thisindependent text—and the Vajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala it describes—might have existed isunclear. However, the Litany of Names of MañjuŸrı, another important tantra dated toapproximately the same time period (late seventh or early eighth century)160 as theCompendium of Principles, has a section of fourteen verses on the Vajradh›tu GreatMa ̊ ̃ala.161 Thus, it seems likely that the Vajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala existed in some stage ofdevelopment prior to the compilation of the Compendium of Principles.162 Given itsimportance not only in the Compendium of Principles but also in other included under therubric of Yoga Tantras as well as in the development of Indian Buddhist tantra as awhole, it is quite possible that the Vajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala represents the core practice of the   160 Ronald M.

For each ma ̊ ̃ala, the deities that comprise it are first emanated, and then thema ̊ ̃ala is taught. This teaching includes both a presentation of the arrangement of thedeities in the ma ̊ ̃ala and an explanation of the rites that are performed therein.In the first section of the Compendium of Principles, the five Buddhas of the fiveBuddha families enter into absorption in meditative stabilization and then emanate thedeities of the ma ̊ ̃ala through uttering their respective mantras (these short mantras are,in most cases, knowledge-mantras [Tib: rig pa; Skt: vidy›164]). This is an abbreviatedrendering of the process; I have omitted several steps involving the emanation of light-rays from the hearts of deities that purify all worlds, the withdrawal of these rays backinto the deities’ hearts where they transform into various other deities, and so forth.Butön summarizes this process in this way: since the first section of the Compendiumof Principles is associated with the Tath›gata Buddha family, the ma ̊ ̃alas in this sectionare emanated by the five Tath›gatas.

Thus, although itis a major development for tantra in general, it likely represents an independent practice and textincorporated into the beginning of the Compendium of Principles after the four sections of the body hadbeen composed/ compiled.164 The text actually reads rig pa’i mchog/ vidyottama, but I take mchog/ uttama to be the adjective“supreme” rather than part of the name of the mantra itself."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 63sgyur pa, cakravartin) of the Tath›gata family,165 carries out the explanation of thema ̊ ̃alas and the teaching of their respective rites.166 For the process of emanating thema ̊ ̃alas of the other sections of the Compendium of Principles Vairocana is often joinedby other deities—the Buddhas of the four directions, the Universal Monarchs of the fourBuddha families, and so forth. The teaching of the ma ̊ ̃alas and their rites, however, ishandled by the Universal Monarch of the Buddha family associated with that section ofthe tantra.The second, third, and fourth sections all begin with all Tath›gatas assembling,praising the lead Bodhisattva of that section—Vajrasattva in the form of the UniversalMonarch connected with the section—and requesting him to generate the deities of hisBuddha family. The second section is anomalous in that it consists of two cycles ofma ̊ ̃alas whereas the other three sections have only a single cycle. I will further discussthe second section below (see p. 77 ff). For each of the four ma ̊ ̃alas of each of the foursections, the extensive rite that is set forth comprises the three meditativestabilizations—the meditative stabilizations of initial application (dang po sbyor ba’i tingnge ’dzin, ›diyoga-sam›dhi), supreme king of ma ̊ ̃alas (dkyil ’khor rgyal mchog gi tingnge ’dzin, ma ̊ ̃alar›j›grı-sam›dhi), and supreme king of activities (las rgyal mchog giting nge ’dzin, karmar›j›grı-sam›dhi).

However, at the beginning of the emanation of theVajradh›tu Great Ma ̊ ̃ala, Vajrasattva transforms into Vajrap› ̊i, so there is some justification foridentifying Vajrasattva as the Universal Monarch of the first section. It is possible that this substitutionof Vajrap› ̊i for Vajrasattva reflects continuing developments in Indian Buddhist tantra and theevolution of wrathful forms of deities.166 Butön, Ship, 13a.6-13a.7.

Each of the four sections of the Compendium ofPrinciples has five four-mudr› ma ̊ ̃alas. While these ma ̊ ̃alas are emanated by the fiveBuddhas, it is not clear whether each Buddha emanates his own four-mudr› ma ̊ ̃ala orwhether all five Buddhas together emanate each of the five ma ̊ ̃alas.The single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃ala and its rites represent the most abbreviated procedure setforth in the Compendium of Principles. From its description in the tantra and⁄›kyamitra’s explanation,184 this ma ̊ ̃ala appears to consist solely of a single figure (andthus the “single-mudr›” nomenclature).185 In the first section Vairocana emanates thesingle-mudr› ma ̊ ̃ala in which the single deity is Vajrasattva (who likely representsVairocana), and then Vajrap› ̊i—the Universal Monarch of the first section whom Butönrefers to as Vajrasattva—teaches the ma ̊ ̃ala rite.

Perhaps Amoghavajra is referring to seventeen or thirteenindividual single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃alas, each with a different deity.185 Snellgrove has apparently missed the existence of the single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃ala completely, as he neveronce mentions it in his summary of each of the four sections of the Compendium of Principles."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 69as well. In the third section the identification of the solitary figure is unclear, but it mightbe ViŸvarÒpa; the ma ̊ ̃ala is emanated and taught by AvalokiteŸvara, the UniversalMonarch of the third section. In the fourth section the presentation of the single-mudr›ma ̊ ̃ala is so abbreviated that it is not described; however, according to Butön,fik›Ÿagarbha emanates and teaches this ma ̊ ̃ala.186At the end of each of the four sections that comprise the root tantra of theCompendium of Principles there is a short epilogue with which the section concludes.All Tath›gatas gather and, in order to certify the procedure set forth by the UniversalMonarch (that is, the teaching of the ma ̊ ̃alas and their attendant rites) as an authenticBuddha-voiced teaching (sangs rgyas kyi bka’, buddha-vacana), they say, “Bravo foryou, Vajrasattva!”187 and so forth, and otherwise extol the teaching as supreme.The Appended Fifth Section188The fifth section of the Compendium of Principles begins with the Supplement, alsoknown as the Supplementary Tantra (rgyud phyi ma, uttara-tantra).

However, at the end of his discussion of thetantra—after he has finished describing the fourth section—he mentions additional material whichseems to correspond to the fifth section (Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” pp. 163-165)."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 70Supplementary Tantra teaches the practice of supramundane feats and is for the benefit ofthe sharpest and most able Yoga Tantra trainees.189The structure of the fifth section of the Compendium of Principles is different fromthat of its first four sections. Vajrap› ̊i resumes his role as the lead Bodhisattva, and heteaches the cultivation of the four mudr›s that are taught in the four great ma ̊ ̃alas of thefirst four sections of the tantra.190 Rather than being labeled “extensive rites” as is donein the first four sections, the divisions in the Supplementary Tantra are into tantras—“thetantra of the extensive rite of the pledge-mudr› feat of all families” and so forth. Each“tantra of the extensive rite” is subdivided into four individual “tantras,” with one foreach of the four Buddha families.191 At the conclusion of the Supplement all Tath›gatasassemble, praise Vajrap› ̊I, and thereby confirm what he has taught as authentic, just asthey do at the end of the first four sections of the Compendium of Principles.Although the divisions of the Supplement are called “tantras of the extensive rite,”their description is brief—far moreso even than the terse descriptions of rites in the firstfour sections of the Compendium of Principles. In spite of their brevity, it is clear thatthe function of the rites that comprise the Supplementary Tantra is to elaborate onpractices from the first four sections of the Compendium of Principles. The title of thissection from the tantra itself—“the tantra of the extensive rites of the feats of the methodsof all procedures from the Compendium of Principles of All Tath›gatas”192—reflects this,   189 ’jig rten las ’das pa’i dngos grub sgrub pa gong ma’i yang gong ma’i sems can rjes su gzung ba’i dondu rgyud phyi ma (Butön, Ship, 22b.5-22b.6).190 Butön, Ship, 22b.6.191 In some cases there is a fifth “tantra” at the beginning of the “tantra of the extensive rite”—a “tantra ofthe Tath›gatas” precedes the “tantra of the Tath›gata family.”192 de bzhin gshegs pa thams cad kyi de kho na nyid bsdus pa las brtag pa thams cad kyi thabs kyi cho gargyas pa’i rgyud (Compendium of Principles, P112, vol. 4, 271.1.3); Sarvatath›gatatatvasa ̇grah›tSarvakalpop›ya-siddhi-vidhivistara-tantra ̇ (Yamada, Sarva-tath›gata, p. 475)."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 71as does Butön’s description of this section: rites of achieving feats related to the rootma ̊ ̃alas.193The Second Supplement (rgyud phyi ma’i phyi ma, uttarottara-tantra), which I alsotranslate as Second Supplementary Tantra, structurally resembles the Supplement thatprecedes it. The teacher again is Vajrap› ̊i, and the teaching consists of a series oftantras of extensive rites. However, the intended audience of the Second Supplement isdifferent from that of the Supplement. According to Butön, the Second Supplement istaught for those trainees who are frightened by meditation and are strongly attached toactivities.194 These rites involve external activities such as making offerings to paintedrepresentations of deities and so forth. At the end of this subsection of the Compendiumof Principles all Tath›gatas assemble and praise Vajrap› ̊i, and thereby confirm thecontent of the Second Supplement as authentic Buddha-voiced doctrine.In order to examine further the relationship between the Supplementary Tantra (andthe Second Supplementary Tantra) and the four sections that comprise the body of theCompendium of Principles we must look at the case of the Manifest Enlightenment ofVairocana Tantra, which precedes the Compendium of Principles both chronologicallyand doctrinally. Stephen Hodge has suggested that the Supplementary Tantra of this textin fact represents a summary of the rituals for the convenience of those employingthem—a kind of ritual handbook—and that over time this extra-textual appendix came tobe regarded as part of the tantra itself.195It seems likely that this is also the case for the Compendium of Principles. Unlike thefirst four sections of the tantra, there are no ma ̊ ̃alas explicitly generated in theSupplement and Second Supplement. Rather, the rites described in these two subsections   193 rtsa ba’i dkyil ’khor dang ’brel ba’i dngos grub sgrub pa’i cho ga (Butön, Ship, 23b.1).194 Butön, Ship, 24a.3.195 Hodge, “Considerations,” p. 71."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 72are clearly derived from the ma ̊ ̃alas and rites laid out in the four sections that constitutethe body of the tantra. Additionally, the traditional account is that these two subsectionsare for the most capable and the least capable pracitioners, respectively.All these pieces of evidence support the contention that the Supplement and SecondSupplement originated as extra-textual notes appended to the end of the tantra by thoseemploying the text, and that over time these were absorbed into the text proper.However, it is not clear when the incorporation of the supplements into the text properoccurred. Buddhaguhya, who flourished in the middle of the eighth century, refers to theSupplement and Second Supplement, and Amoghavajra also refers to material fromthem—although he presents the tantra as consisting of only four sections—in a workwritten on the basis of Indian materials he gathered before 746 CE. Thus, it seems likelythat the process of incorporation was occuring already at the beginning of the eighthcentury, and that by the middle of the century the Supplement and Second Supplementwere considered to be part of the tantra proper.Important Aspects of the First and Second SectionsThe Vajradh›tu Great Ma ̊ ̃alaAfter the Bodhisattva Sarv›rthasiddhi has become enlightened as Vajradh›tu throughthe process of the five manifest enlightenments and this supreme enlightenment is thenfurther stabilized and blessed, he travels to Mt.

After further blessing themselves as all Tath›gatas, Vairocana entersmeditative stabilization and emits the essence-mantra “vajrasatva” from his heart,through which Vajrasattva, the first of the sixteen Bodhisattva residents of the Vajradh›tuGreat Ma ̊ ̃ala, is emanated. Following this are various activitives such as emitting anddrawing back light-rays that pervade all worlds with their beneficial presence, deitiesentering into and emerging from each other’s hearts, and so forth.The Bodhisattva Samantabhadra is an integral part of this process, although it is notclear whether Samantabhadra is the embodiment of the minds of all Tath›gatas or is infact another manifestation of and name for Vairocana; further investigation is required. Itdoes appear that Samantabhadra is consecrated as the Universal Monarch (Tib: ’khor lossgyur pa; Skt: cakravartin) of all Tath›gatas through the jeweled crown of all Tath›gatasconsecration, and that he is then consecrated by all Tath›gatas as Vajrap› ̊i through the“Vajrap› ̊i” vajra-name consecration.197 While Butön explains that the UniversalMonarch of the first section is Vajrasattva,198 in the tantra itself the namesSamantabhadra, Vajrasattva, Vajrap› ̊i, and Vajradhara seem to be used indiscriminatelyand interchangeably.

He is surrounded by the Buddhas at the heads of the other four families,each residing in a circle and arranged in the four cardinal directions: Ak ̋obhya of thevajra family in the east, Ratnasambhava of the jewel family in the south, LokeŸvarar›ja(aka Amit›yus or, in later traditions, Amit›bha) of the lotus (or doctrine) family in thewest, and Amoghasiddhi of the action family in the north.A set of sixteen great Bodhisattvas are also present in the Vajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala.Around each of the four Buddhas surrounding Vairocana are arrayed the fourBodhisattvas of their respective Buddha family: Vajrasattva, Vajrar›ja, Vajrar›ga, andVajras›dhu around Ak ̋obhya; Vajraratna, Vajratejas, Vajraketu, and Vajrah›sa aroundRatnasambhava; Vajradharma, Vajratık ̋ ̊a, Vajrahetu, and Vajrabh› ̋a aroundLokeŸvarar›ja; and Vajrakarma, Vajrarak ̋a, Vajrayak ̋a, and Vajrasandhi aroundAmoghasiddhi.   203 slob dpon gyi las dang/ dkyil ’khor thams cad du ’jug pa’i cho ga dang/ dngos grub kyi ye shes dangphyag rgya’i ye shes la sogs pa nas phyag rgya dgrol pa’i bar gyi rdo rje dbyings kyi dkyil ’ khor chenpo’i cho ga rgyas par gsungs so/ (Butön, Ship, 12b.3-12b.4)."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 76Additionally, there are four female deities, known as Perfection goddesses, and each ispaired with the Buddha of her respective family.

Thus, the importance of theVajradh›tu Great Ma ̊ ̃ala cannot be overestimated. It is the primary ma ̊ ̃ala of theCompendium of Principles and the prototype for the other ma ̊ ̃alas of this tantra. Withits five Buddha-family structure, it serves as the primary ma ̊ ̃ala of the Yoga Tantraclass as a whole, and its influence persists in subsequent developments such as tantras ofthe Mah›yoga system.The Structurally Anomalous Second SectionThe structure of the second section of the Compendium of Principles differs from thatof the other three sections. In the first section of the tantra, after the emanation of theVajradh›tu Great Ma ̊ ̃ala, all Tath›gatas assemble, praise the Universal Monarch (’khorlos bsgyur pa, cakravartin) Vajrap› ̊i (aka Vajrasattva) with a litany of 108 names, andrequest that he explain the ma ̊ ̃ala and its rites.

There follows thenarrative of Vajrap› ̊i’s battle with and subjugation of MaheŸvara (aka ⁄iva), which Iwill discuss in some detail in chapter three (see p. 189 ff) and revisit in the context ofMah›yoga in chapter four (see p. 248 ff).Briefly, Vajrap› ̊i outduels MaheŸvara and slays him, brings him back to life (atVairocana’s behest), and finally bestows initiation on him through the sole of his foot ashe stands on the supine and defeated MaheŸvara’s body. MaheŸvara instantly attainsenlightenment and travels to his own world-system. His retinue of worldly gods are alsosubjugated, and Vajrap› ̊i admits them into the ma ̊ ̃ala and bestows the variousinitiations on them (including the name initiation, through which each worldly god orgoddess receives a new—and specifically Buddhist—name and identity).While I will discuss various aspects of this episode and its significance in chaptersthree and four, what is of import in the context of the structure of the Compendium ofPrinciples is the creation of the ma ̊ ̃ala.

However, it is not clear into which ma ̊ ̃ala the worldly deities are admitted andinitiated. Unlike the other sections of the Compendium of Principles, there has been nodescription of a ma ̊ ̃ala being emanated, and therefore no logical assumption can bemade about the ma ̊ ̃ala into which MaheŸvara and the pantheon of Hindu deities areadmitted and initiated. Perhaps it is assumed that they are admitted into the Vajradh›tuMa ̊ ̃ala, but there is nothing that indicates this. After the worldy gods and goddesseshave been admitted into and initiated in the ma ̊ ̃ala, Vajrap› ̊i explains the ma ̊ ̃ala andits rites. At this point, the ma ̊ ̃ala is identified as the “Conquest over the Three WorldsGreat Ma ̊ ̃ala.”209 The teaching of the ma ̊ ̃ala follows the standard format seen in theprevious ma ̊ ̃alas of the Compendium of Principles.This then raises the question of the emanation of the Conquest over the Three WorldsGreat Ma ̊ ̃ala into which Vajrap› ̊i admits and initiates the retinue of worldly deities.One possibility, as I have mentioned, is that it is the Vajradh›tu Great Ma ̊ ̃ala, and thatafter the worldly gods and goddesses have been transformed into their Buddhist alteregos through initiation they then replace the deities of the Vajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala. Anotherpossibility is that the ma ̊ ̃ala into which the worldly deities are admitted and initiated isonly the physical structure (the residence) and that they then constitute its residents.Whatever the case, the creation of the first ma ̊ ̃ala of the second section of theCompendium of Principles is clearly and significantly different from the other ma ̊ ̃alaspresented in the body of the tantra, which Vairocana either emanates himself or directsthe lead Bodhisattva of that section to emanate.

Ronald Davidson has suggested thatthe MaheŸvara subjugation myth as we find it in the Compendium of Principles containselements, such as the snappy repartee of the dialogue, characteristic of itinerant Indianoral storytellers.210 Thus, it seems probable that the MaheŸvara subjugation episodeexisted as an oral text first set in writing when it was included in the composition of theCompendium of Principles. This also raises the possibility that other parts of thetantra—particularly those that include snappy dialogue such as the narrative of the fivemanifest enlightenments with which the first section opens—indicate the inclusion ofmaterial from oral traditions in the written text of the Compendium of Principles. Wherethese oral traditions might have originated and spread, and how they came to beappropriated into written tantric texts, are questions that require further investigation.211Although the second section begins with its irregular first ma ̊ ̃ala, the remainder ofthe section returns to the standard pattern of the emanation of the ma ̊ ̃ala and theteaching of its respective rites for the Conquest over the Three Worlds retention, doctrine,and action ma ̊ ̃alas, as well as for the four-mudr› and single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃alas.

Following the Conquest over the Three Worldscycle of ma ̊ ̃alas, the second section continues with another ma ̊ ̃ala cycle, that of theWheel of the Three Worlds (’jig rten gsum gyi ’khor lo, triloka-cakra).This sub-section begins with a continuation of the MaheŸvara narrative. All theTath›gatas gather and command Vajrap› ̊i to release MaheŸvara’s body. I will discussthis dialogue, the reanimation of MaheŸvara’s corpse, and related events below.Following this narrative, the tantra returns to the usual procedure for emanating thema ̊ ̃alas and teaching their respective rites. However, this ma ̊ ̃ala cycle consists solelyof the four main ma ̊ ̃alas. Unlike the first section, the first ma ̊ ̃ala cycle of the secondsection, and the third and fourth sections, the Wheel of the Three Worlds cycle does notinclude the four-mudr› ma ̊ ̃ala or the single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃ala. It does, however,conclude with a confirmation of what has been taught, just as the other ma ̊ ̃ala cyclesdo.Thus, we see that the second section of the Compendium of Principles differs from theother three sections of the tantra in several ways. First, the section opens with Vajrap› ̊irefusing the request of all Tath›gatas to generate the deities of his Buddha family.

Asa result, the second section of the Compendium of Principles presents fourteen ma ̊ ̃alas,whereas the other three sections each contain only ten ma ̊ ̃alas. Furthermore, theemanation of the first ma ̊ ̃ala in the section—the Conquest over the Three Worlds GreatMa ̊ ̃ala—is not clearly set forth, so there is uncertainty as to whether the ma ̊ ̃ala wasemanated or whether the subdued worldly deities are arranged in a previously-emanated"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Compendium of Principles 82ma ̊ ̃ala. In addition, the second ma ̊ ̃ala cycle of the second section—the Wheel of theThree Worlds cycle—lacks the four-mudr› and single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃alas found in all theother ma ̊ ̃ala cycles in the four sections of the Compendium of Principles.The ma ̊ ̃alas of the second section consist of wrathful deities, and thus reflect thevajra family (rdo rje rigs; vajra-kula) predominant in this section of the tantra. However,the two ma ̊ ̃ala cycles present an additional difficulty: are they both of the same Buddhafamily? The tantra itself identifies the second cycle as the external vajra family (phyi rolgyi rdo rje’i rigs, b›hya-vajra-kula).212 Butön follows this classification, but he adds thatthe first cycle of ma ̊ ̃alas in the second section—the Conquest over the Three Worldscycle—is the great vajra family (rdo rje chen po’i rigs, *mah›-vajra-kula).213The unique structure of the second section of the Compendium of Principles did notescape the notice of Indian tantric exegetes such as the prolific ninth-century authorfinandagarbha. In the Illumination of the Principles, his mammoth commentary on theCompendium of Principles, he enumerates the ma ̊ ̃alas in each section of theCompendium of Principles, stating that the first, third, and fourth sections each have thesame number of ma ̊ ̃alas—ten. The second section, however, contains fourteenma ̊ ̃alas.214 Thus, finandagarbha explicitly comments on the anomalous nature of the   212 Compendium of Principles, P112, vol. 4, 250.3.4; Yamada, Sarva-tath›gata, p. 257.213 Butön, Ship, 19a.2. According to Giebel’s translation from the Chinese, the eighth-century Indianexegete Amoghavajra described both ma ̊ ̃ala cycles of the second section of the Compendium ofPrinciples as belonging to the external vajra family (Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” pp. 143and 150).

The story of Vajrap› ̊i’s subjugation of MaheŸvara is one of the definingmyths of Indian Buddhist tantra, and, as I will discuss in chapter three (see p. 189 ff), itsinclusion in the Compendium of Principles is significant for several reasons.Indian Commentarial TraditionsThe three principal Indian exegetes of Yoga Tantra, from the Tibetan perspective, areBuddhaguhya, ⁄›kyamitra, and finandagarbha. Buddhaguhya was from central India(perhaps Var› ̊ası) and resided at the great monastic university of N›land›. He wasperhaps the most prominent and prolific of the early Indian monastic tantric exegetes. Astudent of Buddhajñ›nap›da, he wrote commentaries and practical instructions on theManifest Enlightenment of Vairocana Tantra (later classified as Performance or DualTantra), the Questions of Sub›hu Tantra (later classified as Action Tantra),215 and theConcentration Continuation Tantra (later classified as Action Tantra).216Buddhaguhya flourished during the eighth century, an assessment based on two piecesof evidence. The first is his correspondence with the Tibetan king Trisong Detsen (Khrisrong lde btsan, 742-797).217 The second piece of evidence is the inclusion of several of   215 dPung bzang gis zhus pa zhes bya ba’i rgyud, Sub›huparip ̧cch›n›matantra, P428, vol. 9.216 bSam gtan gyi phyi ma rim par phye ba, Dhy›nottarapa ̨alakrama, P430, vol. 9.217 Samten G.

One of the pivotal figures in the legendaryhistories of the origin of tantric texts and lineages in India, King IndrabhÒti (actually, three generationsof IndrabhÒtis) is mentioned in Jñ›namitra’s commentary on the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom in150 Stanzas. Since Jñ›namitra’s text was included in the Denkar Palace Catalogue, we know thatIndrabhÒti predates this.

Since he would have reached intellectual maturity and written his Kosala Ornament sometimeafter this, we arrive at the latter part of the eighth century as an approximate date for ⁄›kyamitra’scommentary (Stephen Hodge, personal communication, 14 April 2002).Ronald Davidson also places ⁄›kyamitra in the late eighth or early ninth century (Davidson, IndianEsoteric Buddhism, p. 159).

Butön says that finandagarbha andMañjuŸrıkırti were “spiritual brothers” (mched grogs),226 which means they would havebeen contemporaries, and Ronald Davidson dates MañjuŸrıkırti to the tenth century.227Thus, if MañjuŸrıkırti and finandagarbha were indeed contemporaries, thenfinandagarbha must have been alive during the tenth century. This assessment seemsprobable, given the range of tantras on which finandagarbha composed commentaries,some of which represented later developments of Indian Buddhist tantra. He is taken inTibetan traditions to be the authoritative Indian Yoga Tantra author, and this is due atleast in part to the fact that he represents later developments of the tradition—certainlylater than Buddhaguhya and ⁄›kyamitra.

In this chapter I will examine the direct literaryprogeny of the Compendium of Principles—the web of texts that spun out of it and builtits declaration of tantra’s independence into a coherent tradition.This nexus of tantras is complex and confusing. It marks both the immediate growth ofa tradition in the century following the Compendium of Principles’ production, and thelong-term development and consolidation of a tradition called “Yoga Tantra” in India andTibet even after other tantric traditions had evolved and displaced the Compendium ofPrinciples and its associated texts from the cutting edge of tantric Buddhism. These textsrepresent a significant development in Indian Buddhist tantra because they constitute forthe first time an organic corpus, albeit with some texts more closely associated with theCompendium of Principles and others less so. Issues that I will address in this chapterinclude the following: What are these individual texts? What are their inter-textualrelationships? What are their developmental histories?While the Compendium of Principles is among the most influential developments ofIndian Buddhist tantra, several other texts later classified as Yoga Tantra also achievedprominence in India and exerted considerable influence in Tibet.

For each tantra,Butön describes the circumstances surrounding its initial teaching (who taught it towhom, where, when, what was taught), and includes a rather detailed summary for eachof the tantra’s sub-sections.Butön employs a sixfold typology of tantras, but in his presentation of the particularsof the individual texts he condenses this into three categories: root tantras (Tib: rtsargyud, Skt: mÒla-tantra), explanatory tantras (bshad rgyud, ›khy›na-tantra), andconcordant tantras (cha mthun pa’i rgyud, *bh›gıya-tantra).The first tantra Butön discusses is the Compendium of Principles, the fundamental textof the corpus later known as Yoga Tantra. His treatment of this, the root tantra andcentral text of the entire Yoga Tantra corpus, is by far the most extensive of any of theYoga Tantras. I have included material from this presentation in the previous chapter, inthe description of the various ma ̊ ̃alas and rites of each section of the Compendium ofPrinciples.

While there are no Chinese translationsof the VajraŸekhara Tantra that correspond to the Tibetan translation (or any other textbearing that title), the term “vajraŸekhara” is extremely important in East Asian tantricBuddhism. The title “vajraŸekhara” itself (Chi: chin kang ting; Jap: kongßchß) isemployed in China during the first half of the eighth century as the name of a collectionof eighteen tantras, of which at least some were translated into Chinese. The Indiantantric master Vajrabodhi (671-741 CE),244 who along with his disciple Amoghavajra(705-774 CE)245 are the two most important figures in the translation and transmission ofthe Compendium of Principles to China, employs the term “vajraŸekhara.” At thebeginning of his explanation of the central practices of the Compendium of Principles, heexplains that the Compendium of Principles was taken from the “100,000 verseVajraŸekharamah›yogatantrar›ja.”246 Here we find the term “vajraŸekhara” employedin the title of the larger textual collection. Furthermore, we also find that the title itselfcorresponds in large part to the title of the VajraŸekhara Tantra as it is preserved in itsTibetan translation, the Sanskrit of which is “VajraŸikharamah›guhyayogatantra.”247With the exception of “guhya” (“secret”) and the term “r›ja” (“king”)—an ornamentalappendage commonly found at the end of tantra titles—Vajrabodhi’s title for the   243 gSang ba rnal ’byor chen po’i rgyud rdo rje rtse mo, VajraŸikharamah›guhyayogatantra, P113 (Toh.480), vol. 5, 1.1.2-56.4.8.244 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 110.245 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 107.246 Eastman, “The Eighteen Tantras,” p. 2, n. 4.247 gSang ba rnal’byor chen po’i rgyud rdo rje rtse mo zhes bya ba."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 96eighteen-text tantric corpus and the title of the Tibetan translation of the VajraŸekharaTantra are the same.The corpus of eighteen tantras that Vajrabodhi mentions was later described in somedetail by his student Amoghavajra in his Chinese text outlining this tantric system,Indications of the Goals of the Eighteen Assemblies of the Yoga of the VajraŸekharaSÒtra.248 In this text Amoghavajra uses the term “VajraŸekhara-yoga” (sometimesabbreviated to “Vajra-yoga”) to refer to the system of tantric practice and doctrine relatedto the eighteen tantras. To confuse the issue further, the title “VajraŸekhara SÒtra” (Chi:Chin gang ting ching; Jap: Kongßchßkyß) is also used in East Asia to refer to the first andcentral member of the eighteen-text tantric corpus, the Compendium of Principles. Thus,in addition to the employment of the term “VajraŸekhara-yoga” to refer to the eighteen-text tantric cycle, “VajraŸekhara SÒtra” is the common title by which the Compendium ofPrinciples is known in East Asia (including Japan to the present).Amoghavajra’s digest of the eighteen texts of the VajraŸekhara cycle provides crucialevidence concerning the formation and content of the VajraŸekhara Tantra.

The titles of the textat the end of each chapter differ markedly for the first and second parts of the text and, asdiscussed above, correspond to the titles of Amoghavajra’s third and second texts,respectively. Moreover, at the end of the first part of the text there is a closing section, acommon structural component marking a text’s conclusion that is found at the end of   251 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 166, n. 159.252 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 168, n. 164.253 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 168, nn. 164 and 166.

This is then followed by the second part of the VajraŸekhara Tantra, whichopens with an homage, a standard element found at the beginning of almost all tantras.While it is customary for the text title (often given in both Tibetan transliteration of theSanskrit and in Tibetan translation) to precede the homage, there are many cases wherethe title is missing and the text begins with the homage. In addition to the presence ofback material at the end of the first half of the VajraŸekhara Tantra followed by frontmaterial at the beginning of the second half, the chapter numbering of the second halfbegins with one rather than continuing the chapter numbering sequentially from the lastchapter of the first half of the text, as is common for Buddhist texts. This indicates thatthe second half of the VajraŸekhara Tantra was originally a separate text that maintainsits own chapter numbering.Thus, the Tibetan translation of the VajraŸekhara Tantra contains several pieces ofpersuasive evidence indicating that the text resulted from the combination of twopreviously independent texts. The existence of material indicative of the end andbeginning of a text at the conclusion of the first half and opening of the second half,respectively, of the VajraŸekhara Tantra, as well as the difference in the title of the textgiven at the end of the chapters of the first and second half of the text and the chapternumbering, strongly suggest that the two parts of the VajraŸekhara Tantra originallyexisted as two independent texts. In this regard it appears that the term “VajraŸekharaTantra” (Tib: rdo rje rtse mo’i rgyud) found at the end of the titles in both parts of theVajraŸekhara Tantra was added, perhaps gratuitously for at least one of the two parts,when the compilation into a single text occurred.There is an additional piece of evidence in Butön’s Yoga Tantra history relating to theformation of the VajraŸekhara. In discussing the Indian tantric figure Buddhagupta,Butön relates an unidentified scholar’s opinion that Buddhagupta directly receivedinitiation and instruction from MañjuŸrı in five tantras: the Compendium of Principles,"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 99the VajraŸekhara, the ⁄rı Param›dya, the Purification of All Bad TransmigrationsTantra, and the Collection of All Procedures (Tib: rTog pa thams cad bsdus pa; Skt:*Sarva-kalpa-samuccaya).254 While the source of this opinion is not known (it could beeither an Indian or a Tibetan scholar), the fact that the VajraŸekhara and the Collection ofAll Procedures are listed as separate texts is significant. I will provisionally assume thatthe Collection of All Procedures mentioned here is the same as the text Amoghavajraidentifies by that title (and which is connected with the first part of the extantVajraŸekhara in Tibetan)—which seems likely since all five texts mentioned aredescribed by Amoghavajra in his summary of the eighteen-text tantric collection (withthe possible exception of the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations). The positionButön relates then perhaps indicates that the title “VajraŸekhara” originally referred onlyto the second part of the extant VajraŸekhara Tantra, and that the Collection of AllProcedures existed as an independent text that was later joined to it to form theVajraŸekhara Tantra as we find it today in Tibetan translation.Amoghavajra describes the Collection of All Procedures as consisting of four parts,which presumably correspond to the four sections of the Compendium of Principles.255The second half of the Tibetan VajraŸekhara Tantra, however, only covers the first twosections of the Compendium of Principles and then abruptly ends.256 After the conclusionof chapter four, the text continues with what appears to be the beginning of a newsection,257 as Vairocana and all the Tath›gatas praise Vajrasattva with a litany of 108names and supplicate him to generate the great mode in order to subjugate poisonous   254 des de nyid bsdus pa dang/ rdo rje rtse mo dang/ dpal mchog dang po dang/ ngan song sbyong ba’irgyud dang/ rtog pa thams cad bsdus pa dang lnga’i dbang dang gdams pa rnams ’jam dpal la dngos suthob bo/ (Butön, Ship, 63a.6).255 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 165 and n. 161, pp. 166-167.256 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” pp. 166-167, n. 161.257 VajraŸekhara Tantra, P113, vol. 5, 56.3.5-56.4.7."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 100ones and effect the welfare of sentient beings.258 Rather than the text continuing withVajrasattva giving a teaching in response to the request of all the Buddhas, theVajraŸekhara Tantra surprisingly ends with a closing section consisting of a title thatdemarcates the boundary of the text as a whole.Thus, part of the original text is missing in the extant version. Butön notes this, statingthat the text is incomplete and that following the supplication five-and-a-half collectionsof procedures (or of chapters) appear to be missing.259 He further elaborates the missingcontent as the external vajra family section, the taming transmigrators [section], theaccomplishment of all aims [section], and the action and supreme first Buddha.260Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the second half of the VajraŸekharaTantra represents an incomplete version of the text Amoghavajra identifies as the Yoga ofthe King of Secrets of All Tath›gatas.Determining the date of the compilation of the VajraŸekhara Tantra is a difficult task.Giebel relates Tanaka Kimiaki’s argument that Amoghavajra’s ordering of the first threetexts reflects their historical development. The Compendium of Principles was theearliest composition, followed by its two explanatory tantras, in this order: the Yoga ofthe King of Secrets of All Tath›gatas, which is the second half of the VajraŸekharaTantra (or an earlier version of it); and then the Yoga of the Collection of All Procedures,which is the first half of the VajraŸekhara Tantra (or an earlier version of it).261 Thesetwo texts still circulated as individual texts and had not yet been combined to form the   258 gdug pa rnams ni ’dul ba dang/ /de bzhin sems can don bya’i phyir/ /tshul chen skyed par mdzad du gsol(VajraŸekhara Tantra, P113, vol. 5, 56.4.7).259 gsol ba btab pa’i ’phro la lus nas mjug ma rdzogs te/ ’di’i ’phro phyi rol rdo rje’i rigs kyi dum bu dang/’gro ’dul dang/ don grub dang las dang mchog gi dang po’i sangs rgyas te/ rtog pa bsdus pa phyeddang lnga ma tshang bar snang ngo/ (Butön, Ship, 28b.3-28b.4).260 See previous footnote.261 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 169, n. 167."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 101VajraŸekhara Tantra in the middle of the eighth century, as evidenced by Amoghavajra’streatment of them as separate texts in his summary of the eighteen texts of theVajraŸekhara cycle.While the evidence from Amoghavajra’s Chinese text points to the second half of theeighth century at the earliest as the date of compilation of the VajraŸekhara Tantra,references in the works of the prominent eighth-century Indian tantric exegeteBuddhaguhya support an earlier date.

The first is that the textBuddhaguhya refers to with the title VajraŸekhara is not the same as the extant Tibetantranslation of the VajraŸekhara Tantra, or that it corresponds to only one of the twoindependent texts Amoghavajra mentions that were combined to form the VajraŸekharaTantra as we find it today in Tibetan. Another possibility is that the compilationoccurred after Amoghavajra left south India in 746 CE and before Buddhaguhyacomposed the Entry into the Meaning of the Tantra. Buddhaguhya’s fame as a tantricmaster reached central Tibet during the reign of King Trisong Detsen (r. 755/756-797),265who invited Buddhaguhya to Tibet. According to the letter he wrote in response,Buddhaguhya sent a copy of his commentary on the Compendium of Principles toTibet,266 and therefore could have composed it anytime during the second half of theeighth century. Thus, it is possible that the formation of the VajraŸekhara Tantra fromthe two independent texts mentioned by Amoghavajra occurred after 746 CE and beforeBuddhaguhya wrote his commentary.Another possible explanation is that this compilation occurred in northeastern India(Buddhaguhya was a resident of N›land› Monastery) but not in south India, whereAmoghavajra obtained his texts and teachings.

The customary set of five excellencesis missing not only from the beginning of the first half of the VajraŸekhara Tantra butalso from the beginning of the second half. To address this deficiency, Butön relatesseveral differing opinions about the location of the VajraŸekhara’s initial teaching. Hisown opinion seems to be that the teacher, location, and audience of the VajraŸekharaTantra are similar to those of the Compendium of Principles275—Vairocana taught thetantra in Akani ̋ ̨ha and so forth. Amoghavajra identifies the location of the teaching ofthe second text in the eighteen-text collection, which corresponds to the second half ofthe Tibetan VajraŸekhara Tantra in some form, as Akani ̋ ̨ha.276 He identifies thelocation of the teaching of his third text, which corresponds to the first half of theVajraŸekhara Tantra, as the Dharma Realm Palace.277As for the number of ma ̊ ̃alas, Butön indicates that several sections of theVajraŸekhara Tantra appear to be incomplete.

As preserved in Tibetan translation, the Conquestover the Three Worlds consists of a root tantra (rtsa rgyud, mÒla-tantra) and asupplement (rgyud phyi ma, uttara-tantra).280 In the Peking edition of the Kangyur, theConquest over the Three Worlds Great King of Procedures spans some 102 folio sides.As such, it is approximately one-third longer than the “Conquest over the Three Worlds”section of the Compendium of Principles on which it expounds, which spans roughlyseventy-five folio sides.In terms of Chinese translations, Amoghavajra describes a similar text, in terms ofboth title and content, as the fourth of the eighteen texts of the VajraŸekhara Yoga tantriccorpus.281 Two chapters of the root tantra exist in Chinese translation: T. vol. 20, No.1040, an AvalokiteŸvara ritual translated by Amoghavajra, corresponds to chapter fourwith some additional passages from the supplement; and the first part of T. vol. 20, No.   278 Butön, Ship, 28b.4-28b.5.279 ’Jig rten gsum las rnam par rgyal ba rtog pa’i rgyal po chen po, Trailokyavijayamah›kalpar›j›, P115(Toh. 482), vol. 5, 61.1.1-83.1.8.

Furthermore,since Amoghavajra returned to China from south India with texts in 746, we can date atleast the fourth and seventh chapters of the Conquest over the Three Worlds to the middleof the eighth century at the latest.This explanatory tantra was taught by Vairocana, in the inestimable mansion—thetiered structure ornamented with vajras and jewels and so forth—on the peak of Mt.Meru, to an audience of many tens of millions of Bodhisattvas, as well as gods, n›gas,yak ̋as, and so forth who have faith in the teachings.284 The body of the Conquest overthe Three Worlds Great King of Procedures begins with the Bodhisattva Vajrap› ̊iasking Vairocana how to subjugate Mah›deva (aka MaheŸvara, aka ⁄iva) and otherpernicious beings.

Ronald Davidson has pointed out that the snappy dialogue we find in theMaheŸvara subjugation myth in both the Compendium of Principles and the Conquestover the Three Worlds Great King of Procedures is indicative of oral traditions ofwandering storytellers.285 Thus, the narrative of Vajrap› ̊i’s defeat of MaheŸvara in boththe Compendium of Principles and the Conquest over the Three Worlds Great King ofProcedures represents the codification in written form of a previously independent oraltext.The relationship between the Compendium of Principles and the Conquest over theThree Worlds Great King of Procedures is more difficult to determine.

Ian Astley-Kristensen has summarized much of this research in the introduction to his translationand analysis of the central Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom text employed in Japan,295and Rolf Giebel has further distilled and clarified these findings in discussing relatedtexts described by Amoghavajra in his Chinese digest of the VajraŸekhara cycle.296 I willdraw heavily on these works in my discussion.   294 In Japan the general term Rishukyß is used to refer to this tradition.

The Tibetan classification of the eighth-century translation of the Modeof the Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzas also supports the argument that a tantricversion of the text existed in India by the middle of the eighth century.The Indian monk D›nap›la (Shih-hu) made the last Chinese translation of the shortversion of the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom, c. 990.311 D›nap›la’s translation seemsto have exerted little lasting influence in either China or Japan, probably because theinfluence of tantra qua tantra in China declined in the hundred or so years followingAmoghavajra’s death in 774 CE, and because the tantric systems employed in Japan stemprimarily from traditions brought to China during the late eighth and early ninth century.We see in the Chinese translations of the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom in 150Stanzas its development from a standard Perfection of Wisdom text that does not evencontain mantras (Hsüan-tsang’s translation) to a text that includes mantras (Bodhiruci’stranslation) and finally to a text employed within a fully tantric system (Amoghavajra’stranslation).

The use ofthe word “then” (Tib: de nas; Skt: atha) indicates that this is the continuation of   348 bde ba chen po rdo rje don yod pa’i dam tshig gi rtog pa’i rgyal po chen po las shes rab kyi pha rol tuphyin pa’i tshul rdzogs sho// (⁄rı Param›dya I, P119, vol. 5, 133.3.5).349 dPal mchol [sic] dang po’i sngags kyi rtog pa’i dum bu zhes bya ba,⁄rıparam›dyamantrakalpakha ̊ ̃anama, P120 vol. 5, 133.3.6."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 124something else, and in fact “then” is used throughout texts of the Yoga Tantra corpus(including both ⁄rı Param›dya texts as well as the Compendium of Principles) to begin anew section (whether an individual rite, a chapter, a larger section of the text, orwhatever).

Furthermore, the introduction of the ⁄rı Param›dya II completely lacks adescription of the audience, location, and time of the teaching. Thus, this text lacks threeof the five excellences (Tib: phun sum tshogs pa) that serve as the criteria of authenticityfor a text of Buddha-speech within Buddhist tradition.I will translate the opening passage of the tantra, since it is important in establishingthe relationship between the ⁄rı Param›dya I and the ⁄rı Param›dya II.Then the Supramundane Victor Vairocana, who has attained the secret realityof all Tath›gatas and who is without the elaboration of all phenomena, againtaught this excellent ⁄rı Param›dya that is without beginning, middle, orend—vajra-reality, the door of the mode of the perfection of wisdom, called“Great Bliss Fruitful Vajra Pledge.”350Here we find again reference to the text as the “mode of the perfection of wisdom,”which as we saw from the closing section of ⁄rı Param›dya I is the title for the firstsection of the larger tantra.

I will discuss this and othervariations on the text title found in ⁄rı Param›dya II in more detail below, in discussingthe three cycles that comprise the ⁄rı Param›dya (see p. 130 ff).Following the rehearsal of its benefits, the ⁄rı Param›dya II continues withVajrasattva taking center stage. Vairocana enters meditative absorption and entreatsVajrasattva, who then emanates the various ma ̊ ̃alas of this text and sets forth theirattendant extensive rites.352 In terms of the number of ma ̊ ̃alas presented in the ⁄rıParam›dya as a whole (both parts of the Tibetan translation) there are two positions heldby Indian exegetes. According to Butön, finandagarbha asserts that the first section ofthe ⁄rı Param›dya (which constitutes ⁄rı Param›dya I) has fifteen ma ̊ ̃alas; and thatthe second, third, and fourth sections (which constitute ⁄rı Param›dya II) have twenty-seven, twenty-one, and twenty-one ma ̊ ̃alas, respectively, making a total of eighty-fourma ̊ ̃alas.353 Butön relates that the master Padmavajr›ºkuŸa holds that there are seventy-eight ma ̊ ̃alas, and explains the discrepancy by the fact that Padmavajra does not have   351 bde ba chen po rdo rje don yod pa’i dam tshig dpal mchog dang po (⁄rı Param›dya II, P120, vol. 5,133.5.3).352 Butön, Ship, 33a.7-33b.4.353 slob dpon kun sying gis dum bu dang po la dkyil ’khor bco lnga/ gnyis pa la nyi shu rtsa bdun/ gsum padang bzhi ba la nyi shu rtsa re re ste/ brgyad cu rtsa bzhir bzhed (Butön, Ship, 34b.7)."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 126the five ma ̊ ̃alas of the secret goddesses or their condensed ma ̊ ̃ala.354 Butön alsostates that the Shorter Commentary on the ⁄rı Param›dya reckons the number ofma ̊ ̃alas to be seventy eight, which agrees with Padmavajra’s calculation. 355Although there are no extant Sanskrit manuscripts of the expanded versions of theMode of the Perfection of Wisdom to guide us in reconstructing the tradition’s historicaldevelopment, there are three references to the ⁄rı Param›dya in early Indian tantriccommentarial literature. Two of these references are found in Tibetan translations andone reference is preserved in a Chinese text. The prolific tantric exegete Buddhaguhyamentions the ⁄rı Param›dya as an example of a Yoga Tantra at the beginning of hiscommentary, preserved in Tibetan, on the Manifest Enlightenment of VairocanaTantra.356 The monastic scholar Jñ›namitra also mentions the ⁄rı Param›dya in hiscommentary on the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzas.357 In addition, theIndian tantric master Amoghavajra, in his Chinese summary of the eighteen texts of theVajraŸekhara tantric system, lists as the eighth text the Supreme First Yoga, for whichRolf Giebel reconstructs the Sanskrit as Param›dya-yoga.358 The similarity between thistitle and that of the ⁄rı Param›dya is striking (“Ÿrı” means “glorious” and is sometimesadded ornamentally at the beginning of a text’s title, although whether this is the casehere requires further investigation) and is almost certainly not coincidental. The locationof the tantra’s teaching that Amoghavajra sets forth is the same as that of the first Tibetan⁄rı Param›dya text—the palace of the king of the gods who control others’   354 slob dpon padma’i rdo rje lcags kyus/ ... dum bu bzhi pa la gsang ba’i lha mo’i dkyil ’khor lnga de’i rigsbsdus dang drug med pas bdun cu rtsa brgyad du bshad cing/ (Butön, Ship, 35a.1-35a.2).355 dpal mchog ’grel chung nas kyang de ltar bshad do/ (Butön, Ship, 35a.2).356 Hodge, “Considerations,” p. 58.

These three mid-eighthcentury Indian scholars all refer to a tantric text entitled “Param›dya,” “⁄rı Param›dya,”or “⁄rı Param›dya Garland.” In light of these references to the ⁄rı Param›dya in Indiancommentarial literature of the mid-eighth century, we can conclude that the production ofthe ⁄rı Param›dya in India had likely occurred by that time. However, such a text almostcertainly represents an early stage in the development of the ⁄rı Param›dya; thus, wecannot conclude that the ⁄rı Param›dya existed in eighth-century India in the form wefind it today in Tibetan and Chinese translations.361This then begs the question of the shape and content at this point in their developmentof the texts Buddhaguhya and Jñ›namitra refer to by title and which Amoghavajra brieflydescribes. Unfortunately, because there are no known Sanskrit manuscripts, and becausetranslation activity in both Tibet and China slowed during the ninth and tenth centuries,the stages in this final phase of development of the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdomremain unclear, awaiting further research to disclose them.One possible piece of evidence related to the development of the ⁄rı Param›dya restsin Butön’s presentation of the tantra. According to him, finandagarbha says that the ⁄rıParam›dya contains eighty-four ma ̊ ̃alas, while Padmavajr›ºkuŸa holds that there areseventy-eight ma ̊ ̃alas.

ÊŸvara here perhapsrepresents those who are not trained by the short mode of the perfection of wisdom text.As a skillful means Vairocana makes the text and its practices sexy. He first transformshimself into a body of great bliss surrounded by beautiful women. Then he teaches themethod of great bliss by displaying the seventeen pure states (roughly speaking,emptinesses) in the form of goddesses. This method thus presents a path to the state ofgreat bliss that does not involve the renunciation of one’s family, sexuality, and so forth.While this likely appealed to the average lay patron in India, it would have beenparticularly alluring to the rulers of petty kingdoms that sprang up all over India (andhence the reference to a practice that does not involve giving up one’s domain) after thedisintegration of the Gupta dynasty. Thus, this might reflect the development of certainstrands of Buddhist tantra in India in response to depleted treasuries and increasedcompetition for patronage.363   362 slob dpon padma’i rdo rje lcags kyus/ ... dum bu bzhi pa la gsang ba’i lha mo’i dkyil ’khor lnga de’i rigsbsdus dang drug med pas bdun cu rtsa brgyad du bshad cing/ (Butön, Ship, 35a.1-35a.2).363 Ronald Davidson has advanced such theories on the development of Indian Buddhist Tantra in IndianEsoteric Buddhism, and particularly chapters three-five.

Taking the Tibetan version of the ⁄rıParam›dya as the tantra in its final form, the Japanese scholar Fukuda Ryßsei hasidentified three distinct parts or cycles of the ⁄rı Param›dya that originally circulated asindependent texts in India.364 The first of the three parts represents the expansion of theshort tantric texts of the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzas through theaddition of instructions for constructing ma ̊ ̃alas and performing various rituals.365 Thefirst Tibetan ⁄rı Param›dya text (P119) represents this part of the larger work.366Interestingly, this assessment mirrors the opinion of the fourteenth-century Tibetanscholar Butön, who states that the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzasappears to be for the most part similar to the first section of the ⁄rı Param›dya,367 the“Perfection of Wisdom Section” (that is, the ⁄rı Param›dya I). The first part of Fa-hsien’s Chinese translation (T. vol. 8, No. 244)—from the beginning of the text throughthe beginning of section fourteen—also represents this cycle.368On the basis of the text titles given at the end of each chapter and in the closing sectionof ⁄rı Param›dya I (bDe ba chen po rdo rje don yod pa’i dam tshig), the Sanskrit title ofthis cycle is reconstructed as *Mah›-sukha-vajr›mogha-samaya369—Great Bliss FruitfulVajra Pledge.

Every mention of this text that I have seen in westernscholarship (including the Catalogue of the Nyingma Edition of the Kangyur) refers to itas the “Vajra-ma ̊ ̃ala-alaªk›ra.” However, in the Sanskrit title at the beginning ofboth the Peking394 and Derge395 editions of the text we find “Vajra-ma ̊ ̃a-alaªk›ra”rather than “Vajra-ma ̊ ̃ala-alaªk›ra.” Thus, there seems to be confusion over thecorrect Sanskrit title of the text.The Tibetan translation “snying po” supports the case for the Sanskrit “ma ̊ ̃a” ratherthan for “ma ̊ ̃ala.” “Ma ̊ ̃a” means pith or essence, and this is one of the primarydenotations of the Tibetan word “snying po.” Furthermore, the Tibetan “snying po”renders the Sanskrit “ma ̊ ̃a” in other cases, including the translation of “bodhima ̊ ̃a”(the seat or platform of enlightenment on which all Buddhas are said to sit when theyattain enlightenment, and also the essence of enlightenment), which is translated intoTibetan as “byang chub kyi snying po.” I know of no cases in which “snying po”translates “ma ̊ ̃ala”; for this important word the standard Tibetan translation “dkyil’khor” is nearly always employed.Additionally, the Sanskrit title given at the beginning of PraŸ›ntamitra’s commentaryon the Vajra Essence Ornament Tantra—the only known Indian exegesis of the tantra,       gros brtan pa, 1276-1342 (P2085, Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center, www.tbrc.org; George N.Roerich, The Blue Annals [Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1949; rpt. 1988], pp. 786-787).The situation of two translator colophons appearing at two different places in the tantra raisesimportant questions. Does the material on the approximately twelve folio sides (in the Peking edition)between the two translator colophons represent a later addition to the text, made after Sakya Pa ̊ ̃ita’sthirteenth-century translation? If so, does this reflect late developments in the tantra in India? Furtherresearch is necessary to address these questions.394 Vajra Essence Ornament Tantra, P123, vol. 5, 194.2.1.395 Vajra Essence Ornament Tantra, Karmapa Derge Edition, Toh. 490, vol. 86, 2.1."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 135which is preserved in Tibetan translation396—reads “vajrama ̊ ̃›laªk›ra” and not“vajrama ̊ ̃al›laªk›ra.”397 Furthermore, PraŸ›ntamitra’s explanation of the title refersto “vajra-ma ̊ ̃a” rather than “vajra-ma ̊ ̃ala.” He glosses “vajra essence” (rdo rjesnying po) as “essence of enlightenment” (byang chub kyi snying po), which he furtherexplains to mean the state or locus of all Buddhas.398 This is one of the standard sensesin which “ma ̊ ̃a”/ “snying po” is used.Therefore, on the basis of the representations of the Sanskrit title from the Tibetantranslations of the tantra itself and the sole extant Indian commentary on it, the use of theTibetan translation equivalent “snying po,” and PraŸ›ntamitra’s explanation of the termin the title, I feel that “ma ̊ ̃a” rather than “ma ̊ ̃ala” is the correct reading.399 Given therules of sandhi and the prevalence and importance of the word “ma ̊ ̃ala” in tantricmaterials, it is likely that the title “vajrama ̊ ̃›laªkara” was misread as   396 PraŸ›ntamitra, dPal rdo rje snying po’i rgyan gyi rgyud chen po’i dka’ ’grel,⁄rıvajrama ̊ ̃›laªk›ramah›tantrapañcik›, translated by (Bu ston) Rin chen grub, P3338 (Toh. 2515),vol. 73, 266.5.1-291.5.8.397 PraŸ›ntamitra, rDo rje snying po’i rgyan gyi dka’ ’grel, P3338, vol. 73, 266.5.1.398 rdo rje snying po’i rgyan zhes bya ba’i don gyi ming can ’di ni rgyud do/ /’di ltar rdo rje snying po nibyang chub kyi snying po ste sangs rgyas thams cad kyi gnas so/ (PraŸ›ntamitra, rDo rje snying po’irgyan gyi dka’ ’grel, P3338, vol. 73, 266.5.4-266.5).The entire passage explaining the title reads:rdo rje snying po’i rgyan zhes bya ba’i don gyi ming can ’di ni rgyud do/ /’di ltar rdo rjesnying po ni byang chub kyi snying po ste sangs rgyas thams cad kyi gnas so/ /de’i rgyanni bla na med pa’i khang ba brtsegs pa gang yin pa de de bzhin du brjod par bya’o//yang na rdo rje ni chos kyi sku’i bdag nyid can te/ dbye bar byar med pa nyid kyi phyirro/ /snying po ni long spyod rdzogs pa’i sku’i rang bzhin te thams cad kyi snying porgyur pa nyid kyi phyir dang/ sems can gyi don rdzogs pa’i snying rje’i phyir yang ngo//sna tshogs pa’i sprul pa ni rgyan te bcom ldan ’das rnam par snang mdzad do/ yang nardo rje ni dbye bar byar med pa ste khang pa brtsegs pa’o/ /de’i snying po ni ’dzin pa’iphyir rdo rje ste byang chub kyi gdan no/ /’di lhag par gnas par rgyas par byed pa’iphyir ro/ (266.5.4-266.5.7).399 There is a connection between the Sanskrit terms “ma ̊ ̃a” (essence) and “ma ̊ ̃ala”: “ma ̊ ̃ala” is oftencreatively etymologized to “ma ̊ ̃a-labha,” that is, “that which contains or holds the essence.”"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 136“vajrama ̊ ̃al›laªkara,” with the extra “-al-” mistakenly inserted, and that this error hasthen been systematically compounded in scholarship on the text.Aside from the correct Sanskrit title of the text, there is disagreement about theclassification of the tantra itself. While the Vajra Essence Ornament Tantra is usuallyincluded in the Yoga Tantra class, some scholars have put it in the Highest Yoga Tantraclass on the basis of its content. Perhaps introducing further confusion is the existence ofanother tantra with an almost identical title. This text, the Glorious Vajra EssenceOrnament Tantra,400 is part of the Secret Assembly (Guhyasam›ja) cycle of HighestYoga Tantra. Additionally, although the same Tibetan translation term “snying po” isused in both the title of this text and in the Yoga Tantra Vajra Essence Ornament Tantra,the Sanskrit original is different. In the Secret Assembly-cycle Vajra Essence OrnamentTantra the Sanskrit original is “h ̧daya” rather than “ma ̊ ̃a.” It is thus possible thatscholars classifying the Yoga Tantra Vajra Essence Ornament Tantra as Highest YogaTantra did so at least in part on the basis of confounding it with the nearly identicallytitled tantra of the Secret Assembly cycle, even though the Yoga Tantra Vajra EssenceOrnament Tantra is a much longer text.The first part of the introductory scene-setting of the Vajra Essence OrnamentTantra401 is similar to that of the Compendium of Principles and other texts laterclassified as Yoga Tantra. The teacher is Vairocana.

The locale is theinestimable mansion of clear light—the essence of Vairocana—and thus differs from thatof the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzas and the ⁄rı Param›dya. Butöndescribes the teaching itself as “the door of the pure mode of phenomena.”402The body of the text then begins with Vairocana, lord of vajra-yoga, instructingMañjuŸrı to invite all Buddhas and vajra-holders (Tib: rdo rje ’dzin pa; Skt:*vajradhara), which he does. The prominence of MañjuŸrı in this tantra is unusual for aYoga Tantra, since Vajrap› ̊i or Vajrasattva is usually the main Buddhist actor who playsopposite Vairocana. As we saw in the Compendium of Principles, we often findmanifestations of Vajrap› ̊i/ Vajrasattva appearing in the sections dealing with theirrespective Buddha family. For instance, AvalokiteŸvara emanates the deities of thema ̊ ̃alas in the third section of the Compendium of Principles, since this section of thetantra is associated with the lotus (or doctrine) family. MañjuŸrı does teach one of thechapters in the first section of the ⁄rı Param›dya and he displays the MañjuŸrı ma ̊ ̃alain the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzas, but apart from these two cases, Ihave not seen MañjuŸrı play a central role in any text included in the Yoga Tantra class(even when he is identified by name as a member of the audience of Bodhisattvas listedat the beginning of a text).Vairocana then caused all the assembled Buddhas and vajra-holders to enter his heartby saying “bhru ̇.” Due to this Vairocana transforms into four-faced Vairocana and thenteaches the twenty pure states that are the states of a Bodhisattva. There follows furtherteachings related to the perfection of wisdom: the enumeration of phenomena of the doorof the mode of the perfection of wisdom together with its benefits, the twenty-five doors   402 chos kyi tshul dag pa’i sgo (Butön, Ship, 35a.4)."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 138of the perfection of wisdom together with its benefits, and so forth.

Among these are a section which includes a narrative of ⁄›kyamuni’senlightenment. In this account the already enlightened Vairocana displays the method ofbirth as ⁄uddhodana’s son (that is, as Siddh›rtha), attaining complete enlightenment, andconquering the four demons. Then he resides on the platform of enlightenment (byangchub kyi snying po, bodhima ̊ ̃a), enters the 84,000,000,000 meditative stabilizations,actualizes enlightenment through the five manifest enlightenments, and so forth.403Butön states that the Vajra Essence Ornament Tantra has thirty-seven ma ̊ ̃alas thatare explicitly and clearly set forth.404 He further indicates that in the commentary405(which he translated) the final ma ̊ ̃ala is divided by way of the progression of theprincipal deity and therefore there are forty-one ma ̊ ̃alas.406While the non-tantric versions of the short Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom date tothe seventh century and the tantric versions date at the latest to the middle of the eighthcentury (with the exception of Shih-hu’s Chinese translation, T.242, made at the end ofthe tenth century), the four long versions of the tantra are later works.

The references inIndian commentarial literature to the three parts of the ⁄rı Param›dya identified byJapanese scholars suggests the likely scenario that by the eighth century in India threeindependent textual traditions had emerged (at least in early stages of their development),and that at some point before the end of the tenth century these were combined to formthe ⁄rı Param›dya as we find it in Tibetan translation (and partially in Chinese).Additionally, the Vajra Essence Ornament Tantra represents a separate strand ofdevelopment of the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom tradition.407The Purification of All Bad Transmigrations TantraAside from the Compendium of Principles, the Purification of All BadTransmigrations Tantra (Tib: Ngan song thams cad yongs su sbyong ba’i rgyud; Skt:SarvadurgatipariŸodhana Tantra) is one of the most important of the texts later classifiedas Yoga Tantra. There are two versions of this tantra: an earlier version, of which thereare no known extant Sanskrit manuscripts although there is a Tibetan translation; and alater version of the text, for which we have late Sanskrit manuscripts and a Tibetantranslation. Tadeusz Skorupski has published an edition of the two versions of thePurification of All Bad Transmigrations Tantra that includes a translation of the laterversion.408 While Skorupski’s work includes a Sanskrit text of the later version, the   407 Astley-Kristensen, The Rishukyß, p. 13.408 Tadeusz Skorpuski, The SarvadurgatipariŸodhana Tantra: Elimination of All Evil Destinies: Sanskritand Tibetan Texts with Introduction, English Translation and Notes (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1983)."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 140Sanskrit manuscripts he uses date only to the seventeenth century.409 Furthermore, theextensive Indian commentarial literature related to the Purification of All BadTransmigrations exists only in Tibetan translation.

This article highlights problematic issues concerning the provenance of thePurification of All Bad Transmigrations Tantra and its corpus of Indian exegetical literature as well asSkorupski’s edition of the text, presenting much original research in the process.409 See Skorupski, SarvadurgatipariŸodhana, pp. xiii-xiv for a list of seven Sanskrit manuscripts and onemodern Sanskrit condensation of the later version of the tantra, all from Nepal.410 De bzhin gshegs pa dgra bcom pa yang dag par rdzogs pa’i sangs rgyas ngan song thams cad yongs susbyong ba gzi brjid kyi rgyal po’i brtag pa zhes bya ba, SarvadurgatipariŸodhanatejor›jasyatath›gatasya arhata ̄ samyaksambuddhasya kalpan›ma, P116 (Toh. 483), vol. 5.411 Butön, Ship, 70a.5-70a.6 and 70b.2.412 Butön, Ship, 70a.6. The colophons of the Peking and Narthang Kangyur editions of the text identify theTibetan translator as *Jayarak ̋ita (rGyal ba ’tsho) rather than as Peltsek Rak ̋ita (van der Kuijp,“SarvadurgatipariŸodhanatantra in Tibet,” p. 109). However, as van der Kuijp points out, there is a greatdeal of uncertainty in Tibet regarding the identification of the translators, which he documents: 1) thetwelfth-century Tibetan author Jetsün Drakpa Gyeltsen (rJe btsun Grags pa rgyal mtshan, 1147-1216)states that it was translated by the first group of seven translator-monks in Tibet such as dBas MañjuŸrı,and does not mention any Indian scholar; 2) Butön only mentions *Jayarak ̋ita and Rinchenchok in thecatalogue to his history of Buddhism; and 3) Gorampa Sönam Senge (Go rams pa bSod nams seng ge,1425-1469) says that it was translated at the time of ⁄›ntigarbha and the seven translator-monks andwas later revised by Ma Rinchenchok (van der Kuijp, “SarvadurgatipariŸodhanatantra in Tibet,” p. 110)."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 141Rinchenchok (rMa Rin chen mchog).413 In addition, the important eighth-century Indiantantric exegete Buddhaguhya sent both a commentary on and a ritual text related to thePurification of All Bad Transmigrations to the Tibetan court414 during the reign of KingTrisong Detsen (r. 755/756-797).415 Thus, we know that the tantra existed in India atleast by the middle of the eighth century. It is possible that the tantra developed earlierthan that, perhaps at roughly the same time as the Compendium of Principles, whichwould put its production during the last quarter of the seventh century.In terms of Chinese materials, Rolf Giebel relates that the Japanese scholar SakaiShinten identifies the fifth text Amoghavajra describes in his summary of the eighteen-text VajraŸekhara corpus with the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations.416 However,Amoghavajra’s title for the text, Vajra Yoga of the Worldy and the Supramundane(*Laukikalokottaravajrayoga), bears no resemblance to the title of the Purification of AllBad Transmigrations, and the identification of these two texts apparently is made withoutcompelling evidence.417 Giebel tentatively associates Amoghavajra’s fifth text with thesimilarly titled Laukikalokottaravajratantra, a text quoted in the Tattvasiddhi attributedto the eighth-century figure ⁄›ntarak ̋ita,418 one of the most influential Indian mastersactive in Tibet during the initial dissemination of Buddhism there.

Chapter one of both versionsbegins with the same introduction. The scene is set with the description of the teacher(who Butön identifies as Vairocana), the locale (a divine palace in a pleasure-grove of theHeaven of the Thirty Three), the audience (the worldly gods ⁄akra and so forth, andseveral million Bodhisattvas), and so on. The text then continues as Indra (aka ⁄akra),the king of the gods, inquires about the rebirth of the god Vimalama ̊iprabha, his formercohort in the Heaven of the Thirty Three who had died seven days earlier. The Buddha(viz., Vairocana) answers that the god Vimalama ̊iprabha has been reborn in the MostTortuous Hell (mnar med, avıci), where he is experiencing the most extreme suffering.The gods are terror-stricken at the thought of their former companion’s suffering and thefear that they themselves might also experience similar torment and misery in the future.They then request a method for purifying bad transmigrations—both for beings currentlysuffering in such circumstances and for beings who might experience such suffering inthe future.439It is at this point that we find the most significant difference between the two versionsof the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations. The earlier version of the tantracontinues with what is identified in the commentarial literature as the root tantra (rtsargyud, mÒla-tantra), composed of the teaching of the root ma ̊ ̃ala and the ritespertaining thereto.440 This, the central ma ̊ ̃ala of the text, is the Sarvavid VairocanaMa ̊ ̃ala441 (“All-Knowing Vairocana”; Tib: kun rig rnam par snang mdzad).

In the narrativeof the tantra ⁄akra performs the rite for the benefit of the fallen-god-turned-hell-beingVimalama ̊iprabha, who as a result is liberated from hell and is reborn in the Tu ̋ita PureLand. After all the assembled gods express their amazement and joy at the efficacy ofthe practices, a discussion of the benefits of performing the rites ensues, after which thefirst chapter of the earlier version of the Purification of All Bad Transmigrationscloses.442In the later version of the tantra the root tantra has been replaced by a completelydifferent text. Skorupski identifies this text as the Ma ̊ ̃alavidhi or fidiyogasam›dhi, andrelates that there are several extant Sanskrit manuscripts from Nepal that share these titlesand have “very similar or almost identical content.”443 While the earlier version of thetantra has as its central ma ̊ ̃ala the Sarvavid Vairocana ma ̊ ̃ala, the later versionreplaces this with the Nine Crown Protuberances (Tib: gtsug [tor] dgu; Skt: navo ̋ ̊ı ̋a)Ma ̊ ̃ala, also known as the “Purification of All Bad Transmigrations Ma ̊ ̃ala” (Tib:ngan song thams cad yongs su sbyong ba’i dkyil ’khor; Skt: sarva-durgati-pariŸodhana-ma ̊ ̃ala).444 Despite the fact that the central ma ̊ ̃ala is different in the two versions ofthe Purification of All Bad Transmigrations, it is important to note that the central deityin both of these ma ̊ ̃alas is the same: the Sarvavid (“All-Knowing”) form of Vairocana.Also, the two ma ̊ ̃alas serve the same function: the purification of all bad transmgrationsand the negative karma that create them. Furthermore, the first ma ̊ ̃ala is identified in   442 Butön, Ship, 39a.5-39b.3.443 Skorupski, SarvadurgatipariŸodhana, p. xxiii.444 Skorupski, SarvadurgatipariŸodhana, p. xxiii."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 149the tantra itself (both the earlier and later version) as being of the great ma ̊ ̃ala (dkyil’khor chen po, mah›-ma ̊ ̃ala)445 variety, which is also the first (and central) of the fourtypes of ma ̊ ̃alas found in the ma ̊ ̃ala cycles of the Compendium of Principles.The second chapter of the Purfication of All Bad Transmigrations is similar in bothversions of the tantra, and is referred to in the tanta-texts themselves as the “Subsequent”or “Later Chapter” (brtag pa phyi ma, uttarakalpa).446 In this chapter the BodhisattvaVajrap› ̊i takes center stage, replacing Vairocana as the central figure that emanates andteaches the rites of the nine ma ̊ ̃alas found in this chapter. Vajrap› ̊i first emanates andteaches the ⁄›kyamuni Ma ̊ ̃ala, the practice of which purifies all defilements andincludes rites for the dead.447One significant difference between the second chapter of the two texts occurs at thispoint. In the earlier version of the tantra the gods, led by Brahm›, ask Vajrap› ̊i whatactions the former god Vimalama ̊iprabha performed in a previous lifetime that resultedin his rebirth in the Most Tortuous Hell. In response, Vajrap› ̊i describes the events ofone of Vimalama ̊iprabha’s past lives in which he was a prince. In order to acceed to thethrone, the prince killed his father the king, and his mother died soon thereafter of theanguish resulting from his patricide.448 Thus, in a previous life Vimalama ̊iprabhacaused the death of both his parents, and this is the karmic event that has impelled hisexistence in hell, enduring the most excruciating suffering.

Butön describes the content of theAbbreviated Consecration Tantra thus:488The teacher, Vairocana, entered meditative stabilization and set forth the basiswhich is to be consecrated; the master who is the consecrator; the place whereit is to be performed; the faults of not performing consecration; the benefits ofperforming it; the necessity of consecration conventionally, even thoughultimately it does not exist; and the rite of the consecration’s three[sections]—preparatory, actual, and concluding—along with when to perform[them].Although there is no Indian exegesis of this tantra, there are several commentarial worksincluded in the Yoga Tantra section of the Tengyur on consecration.

The version of the tantra included in theCollected Tantras of the Nyingma may in fact represent the early translation (Davidson, “Names ofMañjuŸrı,” p. 13) and appears to correspond to three versions of the text found among the Tun-huangdocuments (Dan Martin, “Illusion Web—Locating the Guhyagarbha Tantra in Buddhist IntellectualHistory,” in Silver on Lapis: Tibetan Literary Culture and History, ed.

A root tantra is considered such only in relation to other tantras in constellationaround it. For example, a root tantra is deemed such in relation to a supplementary orcontinuation tantra (Tib: rgyud phyi ma; Skt: uttara-tantra). Two types of relationships   508 This discussion of Yoga Tantra texts is drawn from Butön, Ship, 29a.4-29a.5 and 55b.4-57b.2.509 Butön was not the first scholar to discuss related tantras within a sixfold structure. See for example thepresentation of the eleventh-century Tibetan scholar Sonam Tsemo (bSod nams rtse mo, 1142-1182) inMalati J. Shendge, “The Literary Forms of Tantras,” in Transactions of the International Conference ofOrientalists in Japan 9 (1966), p. 39."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 164can obtain between a supplementary tantra and a root tantra: one in which the root tantraand the supplementary tantra are different texts and one in which they are both part of thesame text.The first type, in which the root tantra and the supplementary tantra are differenttantras, refers to the temporal relation that obtains between the texts. Within the YogaTantra system, for instance, in a chronological sense the Compendium of Principles is aroot tantra in relation to any other tantra because the initial promulgation of theCompendium of Principles preceded that of the other Yoga Tantras.510 In this case, theSanskrit term uttara-tantra and its Tibetan translation equivalent rgyud phyi ma, which Itranslate in other contexts as “supplementary tantra” or “continuation tantra,” are moreaccurately rendered as “later tantra” or “subsequent tantra” to reflect the temporal aspectof the relationship between the texts.In the second type of relationship that can obtain between a root tantra and asupplementary tantra, both are part of a single text. Butön presents two instances of sucha relationship: in the context of a tantra that consists of two parts and in the context of atantra that consists of three parts. The first Yoga Tantra example is the Conquest over theThree Worlds Great King of Procedures.511 This text as we find it in the Kangyurconsists of only two parts—a root tantra and a supplementary tantra. Thus, thesupplementary (or continuation) tantra portion of this text is an example of a   510 ’dir dang po’i dbang du byas pa ste/ de kho na nyid bsdus pa lta bu’o/ (Butön, Ship, 55b.6). Butönexplained above, in the lengthy section entitled, “How Vairocana, Having Become Buddhified, Turnedthe Wheel of Yoga Tantra Doctrine,” that the Compendium of Principles was the first Yoga Tantraspoken, and thus all other Yoga Tantras were taught subsequent to it.511 ’Jig rten gsum rnam rgyal gyi rtog pa’i rgyal po chen po, Trailokyavijayamah›kalpar›ja, P115."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 165supplementary tantra in the treatment of a root tantra and a supplementary tantra within asingle text.512An example of a root tantra in relation to a supplementary tantra within the context ofa single text that has three parts is the Compendium of Principles, which consists of a roottantra, a supplementary tantra, and a second supplementary tantra (rgyud phyi ma’i phyima, uttarottara-tantra).513 Here, the three parts of the text—the root tantra,supplementary tantra, and second supplementary tantra—are distinguished by what theyteach and for whom they teach it. The root tantra teaches the entity of the principles ofmundane and supramundane doctrines, and this teaching is common to all Yoga Tantratrainees. In contrast, the supplementary tantra is intended for the best Yoga Tantratrainees; it teaches the practice of mundane and supramundane feats and the principle ofthe beginningless and endless great pledge, which is the cause of attaining the state of aBuddha or Bodhisattva. Finally, the second supplementary tantra was promulgated forless adept Yoga Tantra trainees—those who are frightened of internal meditation and arestrongly attached to external activities, and who are incapable of engaging in the practicesof special and supreme feats. For these trainees, the second supplementary tantra teachesmethods having external objects of observation.514In the context of the relationship between a root tantra and an explanatory tantra, allthree parts of the Compendium of Principles just discussed—the root tantra comprised bythe four sections, the supplementary tantra, and the second supplementary tantra—areincluded in the root tantra.

Then, for the benefit offuture generations of Yoga Tantra trainees, this extensive tantra was condensed andtaught; this constitutes the condensed tantra. An example of such a root tantra is theCompendium of Principles in 100,000 Stanzas spoken by Vairocana in the Akani ̋ ̨haPure Land, while the received text of the Compendium of Principles—consisting of whatabove was described as the root tantra, supplement, and second supplement—represents acondensed tantra. This situation of an extensive version initially taught to an audience ofBodhisattvas and others in a heavenly realm, and a briefer version of the tantra that iscondensed and then taught for the benefit of future practitioners, obtains also for the otherfive types of tantras.This presentation of a root and condensed version of every tantra has importantramifications. It is only the initial teaching of a tantra, usually in a Pure Land to anassembly of Bodhisttvas, that is the full form of the teaching. The tantra that humansreceive is the condensed version of the tantra. Thus, the received tantra-texts arenecessarily condensed—and therefore edited—versions of the original teaching. Perhapsthis reflects an awareness of the role of human agency in the production of the receivedtext, even as it is believed to come through divine inspiration. This implies anunderstanding that the production of the tantras involves a hermeneutical and editorial   515 Malati J. Shendge, “The Literary Forms of Tantras,” in Transactions of the International Conference ofOrientalists in Japan 9 (1966), p. 37."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 167process, and that something is always lost in a received text vis-à-vis the originalteaching from which it derives.Butön’s discussion of root tantras covers the semantic range of the terms “root tantra,”“subsequent/ supplementary tantra,” and so forth. What is striking about his presentationis the relational nature of these terms. For instance, in terms of two discrete texts, a roottantra is a root tantra in relation to another tantra that was initially taught chronologicallylater; this is the usage of the term rgyud phyi ma/ uttara-tantra that employs theconnotation “subsequent” or “later tantra.” However, within a single text, a root tantra isa root tantra in relation to a supplementary section that follows it; this is the usage of theterm rgyud phyi ma/ uttara-tantra that employs the connotation “supplement.”Furthermore, what is considered a root tantra in relation to an explanatory tantra can alsobe considered a condensed tantra in relation to the original teaching of the tantra, whichin this context is then referred to as the root tantra. Thus, the designation andclassification “root tantra” and so forth is largely relational, particularly within a corpusof associated texts as we find with the Yoga Tantras.Explanatory TantrasThe second category of tantra Butön delineates is the explanatory tantra (bshad rgyud,›khy›na-tantra). He elucidates six ways in which an explanatory tantra expounds upon aroot tantra: clarifying what is unclear, filling out what is incomplete, explaining otherpresentations of different systems, summarizing vast meanings, generating ascertainmentthrough concordance, and differentiating words and meanings.516   516 mi gsal ba gsal bar byed pa/ ma tshang ba kha skong ba/ tshul mi ’dra ba rnam gzhag gzhan ’chad pa/rgya chen po’i don bsdus pa cha mthun pas nges shes bskyed pa/ tshig dang don rnam par ’byed pa(Butön, Ship, 56b.6-56b.7)."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 168Butön then illustrates how the VajraŸekhara Tantra functions as an explanatory tantraof the Compendium of Principles.517 For example, it clarifies practices that are unclear inthe root tantra—the yoga of bathing, meditating a wheel of protection, blessing, and soforth—in the context of explanations of the rite for future practitioners. In the context ofritual preparation of the ground where the rite will be held (Tib: sa chog) and preparatoryenhancement (sta gon), the VajraŸekhara Tantra fills out what is incomplete in theCompendium of Principles, such as the declaration of vows and so forth. In terms ofteaching various systems, the VajraŸekhara Tantra expounds upon the Compendium ofPrinciples by taking the four Perfection Goddesses as the deities of the ma ̊ ̃ala, takingthe hand-symbols of the retention ma ̊ ̃ala as goddesses, and so forth.Also, for each deity for which there is not a specific delineation, the VajraŸekharaTantra summarizes its meaning and then teaches it. In this way it summarizes vastmeanings in the Compendium of Principles. Additionally, procedures in theVajraŸekhara Tantra concordant with the four extensive ma ̊ ̃alas, the four-mudr›ma ̊ ̃alas, the single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃alas, and so forth in the Compendium of Principlesgenerate ascertainment (or certainty) through concordance. Finally, Butön provides anexample of how the VajraŸekhara Tantra differentiates words and meanings in theCompendium of Principles. He uses as an example a line in the Compendium ofPrinciples that reads, “The stable sign self-occuring.”518 The VajraŸekhara Tantraexplains the line thus: “Signs are called ‘stÒpas’. Stability is meditative stabilization   517 This discussion is drawn from Butön, Ship, 56b.7-57a.4.518 mtshan ma bstan pa rang ’gyur nas (Butön, Ship, 57a.2-57a.3). The line appears in the tantra in aslightly different form: mtshan ma brtan par rang gyur nas (Compendium of Principles, P112, vol. 4,238.4.8). The Sanskrit text, which corresponds to the reading in the Tibetan translation of the tantrarather than to Butön’s citation of it, reads: stabdhaliºga ̄ svaya ̇bhÒtv› (Yamada, Sarva-tath›gata, p.147)."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 169itself.”519 In this way Butön illustrates the six ways an explanatory tantra expounds upona root tantra by using as an example the VajraŸekhara Tantra’s explication of theCompendium of Principles.Concordant Tantras and Elaborating or Branch TantrasThe final two of the six types of tantras Butön enumerates are concordant tantras (chamthun pa’i rgyud, *bh›gıya-tantra[?]) and elaborating or branch tantras (spros pa’i rgyudor yan lag gi rgyud,: *prapañca-tantra or *aºga-tantra). The ⁄rı Param›dya Tantra isclassified as a concordant Yoga Tantra because it accords with the teaching of the fourmudr›s in the four sections of the Compendium of Principles.520 Another concordanttantra is the Vajra Essence Ornament Tantra, since its Vairocana ma ̊ ̃ala accords withthe arrangement of deities in the Compendium of Principles.The ⁄rı Param›dya Tantra is also classified as a branch tantra because its rites ofgenerating the five manifest enlightenments and so forth are in relation to, and rely upon,the Compendium of Principles.521 The Purification of All Bad Transmigrations is calledan elaborating Yoga Tantra because it elaborates on the process of purifying beings inbad transmigrations that was set forth in the second section of the Compendium ofPrinciples.522 Or, since most of its main deities are similar to the deities of the firstsection of the Compendium of Principles, the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations isalso called a branch tantra.523Another text that needs to be mentioned here is the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdomin 150 Stanzas. Although this is a Perfection of Wisdom text, it is also considered to be a   519 mtshan ma mchod rten zhes bshad de/ /bstan pa ting ’dzin gyur pa nyid/ (Butön, Ship, 57a.3).520 Butön, Ship, 57a.4-57a.5.521 Butön, Ship, 56a.5-56a.6.522 Butön, Ship, 57a.6.

It is specifically classified as a Yoga Tantra becauseof its relationship with the ⁄rı Param›dya: it is considered to be an explanatory tantra ofthe ⁄rı Param›dya’s first section.524 I have discussed this relationship in some detailearlier in this chapter.The most striking feature of Butön’s discussion of six types of tantras is the centralityof the relation between texts. His presentation of the individual tantra-texts emphasizesthe fact that after the production of the Compendium of Principles and the subsequentemergence of the body of texts associated with it, these traditions were consolidated intoa system, a corpus of related tantras, an organic whole. Furthermore, the discussion ofthe inter-textual relationships of the various instances of the six types of tantras reflectsthe pivotal position the Compendium of Principles holds in the Yoga Tantra system. It isin relation to the Compendium of Principles—the root or fundamental or basic YogaTantra—that every other tantra of the Yoga Tantra system is a Yoga Tantra. Thus, thecentral criterion for a text’s inclusion in the Yoga Tantra system as it was constructed byIndian exegetes appears to be its relationship to the Compendium of Principles. Forexample, the explanatory Yoga Tantra the VajraŸekhara elucidates and expands on theCompendium of Principles in the six ways an explanatory tantra explicates a root tantra,the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations expands upon a practice taught in the secondsection of the Compendium of Principles and thus is an elaborating Yoga Tantra, and soforth.   524 The first section of the ⁄rı Param›dya Tantra is the “Perfection of Wisdom” section (Tib: shes rab kyipha rol tu phyin pa’i dum bu, abbreviated to sher dum; the corresponding Sanskrit would beprajñ›p›ramit›-kha ̊ ̃a).The Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzas is classified as a Yoga Tantra even though itis not explicitly related to the Compendium of Principles; it is considered a Yoga Tantra because of itsrelation to the ⁄rı Param›dya Tantra. However, the Indian Jñ›namitra’s commentary on the Mode ofthe Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzas indicates a relationship with the Compendium of Principles,which I will discuss in more detail in chapter four (p. 253)."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Yoga Tantra Corpus 171It is important to remember that the Yoga Tantra system, like the individual tantrasthemselves, developed over time. Thus, Butön’s fourteenth-century presentation is of amore systematized and mature Yoga Tantra corpus than likely existed during the seventy-five or one-hundred years after the Compendium of Principles was produced around thelast quarter of the seventh century. By the middle of the eighth century north Indianexegetical traditions began to associate these texts as a corpus, which they referred to asYoga Tantra.We find a somewhat different case in south India. Amoghavajra’s eighth-centurypresentation of the VajraŸekhara cycle of eighteen tantras consists of a looseconfiguration of texts in constellation around the Compendium of Principles. However,he does not refer to this corpus as Yoga Tantra (although all but the first text’s titles endin “yoga”). In fact, Amoghavajra does not mention any doxographical distinctionswhatsoever, and texts he describes correspond to those later included in severaldoxographical categories (Yoga Tantra, Mah›yoga, Yoginı Tantra, and Highest YogaTantra).ConclusionThe textual traditions that grew out of the Compendium of Principles exhibit affinities(to greater or lesser degrees) with the tantra that spawned them. As these traditions wereconsolidated, they came to be called “Yoga Tantra” (at least in north India), and thisrepresents the first true corpus in Indian Buddhist tantra. The relationships between theCompendium of Principles and the texts in constellation around it were enumerated andsolidified, and the tantras were divided into categories.Texts later classified under the rubric of “explanatory tantra,” such as theVajraŸekhara Tantra and the Conquest over the Three Worlds Procedure, demonstratethe closest relationship to the Compendium of Principles, as they directly comment andelaborate on it.

In addition, it obscures someof the nuance and detail—and therefore the importance—of these innovations that, eventhough some cases demonstrate continuity with earlier Buddhist traditions, represent arevolution in Buddhist theory and praxis. In this chapter I will examine the importance ofseveral aspects of the Compendium of Principles, such as narrative structures, newpractices (including the integration of earlier doctrinal positions), and the relationshipbetween narrative and ritual.

It then continues with an account of ⁄›kyamuni’s enlightenment which, for thefirst time in Indian Buddhist literature, details a tantric process by which Siddh›rtha (hereidentified by a variation on this appellation, “Sarv›rthasiddhi”) became enlightened.525In this narrative, the Bodhisattva Sarv›rthasiddhi, having resolved to attainenlightenment, sits on the bodhima ̊ ̃a (the seat or platform of enlightenment that inbiographies of ⁄›kyamuni is located under the bodhi tree in Bodh Gay›) and enters anunfluctuating meditative stabilization (Tib: mi g.yo ba’i ting nge ’dzin; Skt: ›sph›naka-sam›dhi). All the Tath›gatas gather, display their Complete Enjoyment Bodies (rdzogspar longs spyod pa’i sku, s›mbhogika-k›ya)526 for Sarv›rthasiddhi’s benefit, and rousehim from his meditative state, saying:527   525 Any doubts that the name “Sarv›rthasiddhi” refers to Siddh›rtha (the Bodhisattva who becameenlightened as the historical Buddha ⁄›kyamuni) are resolved in the Compendium of Principles Tantraitself.

This pattern of a contemplativepractice (and its attendant mantra) paired with the ensuing appearance of its realization ina visualized form then continues, as the Tath›gatas instruct Sarv›rthasiddhi in successivepractices to increase, deepen, and stabilize the realization of the preceding manifestenlightenment. The Bodhisattva implements their instructions and reports back therespective visualization or subsequent appearance that results from each manifestenlightenment (a second moon-disc, a vajra standing on that, that vajra having the natureof the body of all Tath›gatas, and finally appearing in the fully enlightened form ofVairocana).531 After the fourth manifest enlightenment the Bodhisattva Sarv›rthasiddhiis consecrated through the name consecration “Vajradh›tu.”Following the fifth and final manifest enlightenment, the now fully enlightenedTath›gata Vajradh›tu requests the Tath›gatas to further bless and stabilize hisenlightenment, and this they do in a series of four rites Butön identifies as the fourmiracles (cho ’phrul, *pratih›rya). These include further rites of blessing, consecration,meditative stabilization, and the performance of enlightened activities. The remainder ofthe Compendium of Principles (roughly ninety-eight percent of the text) involves thenewly enlightened Vajradh›tu, now called Vairocana, engaging in the post-enlightenmentactivities of emanating and teaching the rites of the various ma ̊ ̃alas of each of the foursections of the Compendium of Principles (either directly or by delegating theresponsibility to the universal monarch [’khor los bsgyur pa, cakravartin] of each section,who are in fact transformations of Vajrasattva).Tantric Contemplation: The Process of the Five Manifest EnlightenmentsThe process of meditation set forth in the section on the five manifest enlightenments(mngon byang lnga, pañc›bhisambodhi) illustrates the shift toward inner contemplation   531 Compendium of Principles, P112, vol. 4, 219.5.4-220.1.2; Yamada, Sarva-tath›gata, pp. 8-9."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 177traditionally said to characterize texts of the Yoga Tantra corpus. This process, togetherwith the additional meditative techniques, consecrations, and other activities set forth inthe section on the four miracles, represents a breadth and detail of tantric techniquespreviously unseen in a Buddhist tantra. The narrative of ⁄›kyamuni’s enlightenment andthe process of the five manifest enlightenments with which the Compendium ofPrinciples begins presents in a far more detailed way than in any previous tantricBuddhist literature the paradigmatic tantric practice of deity yoga, in which practitionerscreate themselves as enlightened Buddha figures through a series of contemplations andvisualizations, each accompanied by repetition of a specific mantra.First, in the initial manifest enlightenment, there is the breaking down of physical aswell as mental identity by meditating on the nature of the mind: its emptiness and naturalluminosity. This realization then appears in the form of a moon-disc. There follows theregeneration of oneself, in stages, into the ideal form of a Buddha through the foursubsequent manifest enlightenments. This culminates in one’s empty and naturallyluminous mind, and the realization thereof, appearing in the fully enlightened form ofVairocana, a form composed of the subtle physical, verbal, and mental particles of allTath›gatas.As Matsunaga has pointed out, in this presentation of deity yoga we find theritualization of several central Mah›y›na concepts such as emptiness, the naturalluminosity of the mind, and the symbolism of the vajra.532 While ritual existed inMah›y›na Buddhism from its inception, it was not a central fixture of the path toenlightenment. In the Compendium of Principles the prescribed series of mental,physical, and verbal activities takes center stage, thus shifting ritual from the periphery ofearlier Mah›y›na practices to the center of tantric practice.   532 de Jong, “A New History of Tantric Literature,” p. 98."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 178We also see a clear formulation of the fundamental soteriological practice that runsthrough all subsequent Buddhist tantra—deconstructing one’s identity through meditatingon emptiness and then reconstructing one’s identity in the ideal form of a Buddha—and alevel of detail not seen in earlier tantras. The enlightenment narrative in the Compendiumof Principles also signals a paradigm shift in the Buddhist path to enlightenment. TheBuddhist path in earlier Buddhism—beginning with that preserved in P›li literature andrunning through pre-tantric Mah›y›na traditions—presents a path consisting of ethics,accomplishment in meditative concentration, and liberative insight, with the narrative of⁄›kyamuni’s enlightenment embodying this paradigm. This event is a solitary one, as theBodhisattva Siddh›rtha attains the final goal by himself, sitting under the Bodhi tree. Inthe tantric narrative, however, the Bodhisattva’s enlightenment results from hisinteraction with the assembled Buddhas and, more specifically, through the consecrationsthey bestow on him—along with the requisite instructions—into a series of practices.Thus, enlightenment is no longer a solitary event; it is now a consecratory event. Thisadds a distinctly communal and interpersonal aspect to what was previously anintrapersonal paradigm.The importance of the nature of the mind in the five manifest enlightenmentscontinues the philosophical focus (and the influence of the Yogic Practice School) foundin the first chapter of the Manifest Enlightenment of Vairocana Tantra533—the mostimportant development in Buddhist tantra prior to the Compendium of Principles—inwhich the mind is presented as being naturally completely pure.534 There is the addedfeature, however, that the nature of the mind is luminous, which also traces back to thedoctrines of the Yogic Practice School.

Here, in the context of rites to exorcise wraiths or evil demons, the Buddhainstructs ⁄akra thus:538[O]ne should first visualize his own body as my image, with the thirty-twoprimary and eighty secondary marks, the color of purple gold. The bodyshould be sixteen feet tall, with a solar radiance at the back of the neck.The text continues with instructions to visualize an assembly of monks and Bodhisattvasand then to visualize the spirits of the five directions and their retinues, as it is these   535 T.

There areimportant aspects of this account that we must bear in mind. The Consecration SÒtra inwhich this passage appears is of Chinese provenance. More specifically, it occurs in theseventh section, within an exorcism ritual that Strickmann identifies as a Taoist practiceadopted by Buddhists.540 This Taoist exorcism rite begins with the visualization of agiant spirit-official in front of oneself,541 and the dimensions of the Buddha’s body aretaken from the Taoist rite. However, the addition of the instruction to visualize oneselfas the Buddha is distinctly Buddhist; moreover, as Strickmann mentions, it is distinctlytantric.542Although he identifies the important element of deity yoga as a feature thatdistinguishes the Buddhist exorcistic rite from its Taoist cousin (and identifies it as theearliest mention of deity yoga in a Buddhist text), Strickmann does not discuss it anyfurther. The brief mention of deity yoga in this fifth-century Chinese text is an unusualoccurence; we do not find references to it in Indian materials (preserved in Tibetantranslation) for another two centuries. Further research into this Chinese text and relatedtopics such as when the next mention of deity yoga occurs in a Chinese text might shedmore light on the issue, but this is beyond both my textual abilities and the scope of thisstudy.

While this presentation includes statements like “the mind is naturallycompletely pure,”549 I have not seen any reference in the tantra to the natural luminosityof the mind. The mid-eighth century Indian exegete Buddhaguhya, in commentary on theabove line, writes:550If one’s mind itself has become free from the habitual tendencies which causethe proliferation of selective concepts which have the nature of a perceivingsubject and perceived objects and has become utterly pure, it will beEnlightenment in nature, characterized by natural radiance, immediateexperience, immutability and luminosity of Awareness.Hence, while commentarial traditions as early as the middle of the eighth centuryinterpret the Manifest Enlightenment of Vairocana’s presentation of mind to includedescriptions of its natural luminosity, as far as I know such does not occur in the tantraitself.

Again, to my knowledge this occurs for the first time atthe beginning of the Compendium of Principles: the realization of the natural luminosityof the mind appears as a moon disc and then as a vajra and so on, with the processculminating in the meditator’s visualized appearance in the physical form of the deity.Furthermore, the presentation of deity yoga at the beginning of the Compendium ofPrinciples is the first detailed and complete presentation found in a Buddhist tantra.While texts such as the Chinese Consecration SÒtra and the Manifest Enlightenment ofVairocana Tantra mention appearing as a deity, they lack a coherent presentation of deityyoga that includes meditating on emptiness, appearance in form, and the recitation ofmantras. However, the process of the five manifest enlightenments found in theCompendium of Principles begins with meditating on emptiness and the luminous natureof the mind, continues with the appearance of this realization in form, and proceedsthrough a series of stages to appearance in the physical form of the deity, and each stepincludes the recitation of a specific mantra. Thus, the Compendium of Principles presentsthe first complete description of deity yoga found in a Buddhist tantra.The Enlightenment NarrativeIn addition to an unprecedented level of detail in describing contemplative practicesand the first textual presentation of the central tantric practice of deity yoga, we find inthe account with which the Compendium of Principles opens the first recasting of⁄›kyamuni’s enlightenment in tantric terms.

It represents tantra’s coming out party, its“declaration of independence” as its own tradition, distinct from earlier Buddhisttraditions..Tantric Violence: The MaheŸvara Subjugation Myth, Murder, and Death-RelatedPracticesIn addition to the narrative of ⁄›kyamuni’s tantric enlightenment through the fivemanifest enlightenments, the Compendium of Principles is also the locus classicus ofanother seminal tantric narrative: Vajrap› ̊i’s subjugation of MaheŸvara (aka ⁄iva). Justas ⁄›kyamuni’s enlightenment account in tantric terms as found at the beginning of theCompendium of Principles is unprecedented in Buddhist tantric literature, the MaheŸvarasubjugation account represents the first mythological validation of violence and murderin Indian Buddhist tantric literature. Ronald M. Davidson, in two articles devoted to thistopic and a recent monograph on the rise of Buddhist tantra in its medieval Indiancultural context entitled Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the TantricMovement, makes a compelling presentation of the social influences involved in thegeneration of the MaheŸvara subjugation myth.

At the same time, as large urban centers lost population and smaller,regional centers became increasingly important in trade, one of Buddhism’s chief sourcesof support—long-distance trade guilds—began to diminish. Thus, Davidson argues,Buddhist institutions, under the pressure of declining patronage, adopted variouselements from medieval Indian society, many of which are reflected in the specific formsof tantric Buddhism that developed during this period.554 The Buddhist appropriation ofa discourse of legitimate violence can be understood against this cultural backdrop as anattempt to garner patronage from bellicose rulers by adopting a method through which⁄aiva traditions were enjoying increasing success.In the MaheŸvara subjugation myth, which comes at the beginning of the secondsection of the Compendium of Principles, we find the earliest mythological expression ofthe tantric Buddhist appropriation of the discourse of violence. We also find a secondlayer in this movement toward deities in their wrathful reflexes and their characteristicfierce activities: while adopting the rhetoric of violence of ⁄aiva traditions, the Buddhistsstake their claim to superiority over these same ⁄aiva traditions. Vajrap› ̊ı, underVairocana’s orders, employs violent methods to defeat MaheŸvara (aka ⁄iva), forcinghim to submit to the superiority of the Buddhadharma, renounce his criminal ways, and,in the end, enter the Buddhist fold. In this struggle, Vajrap› ̊ı must resort to the extrememeasure of killing the recalcitrant and unrepentant MaheŸvara, reviving him only at   554 For instance, according to Davidson the consecration rituals (Tib: dbang bskur ba; Skt: abhi ̋eka) ofBuddhist tantras derive from the royal coronation rites of the Pur› ̊as.

In this episode we see not only the Buddhist appropriation of ⁄aivaviolence but also the tantric Buddhist claim to superiority over these very ⁄aivatraditions. In terms of power, Vajrap› ̊i’s magical prowess surpasses that of MaheŸvaraand the pantheon of worldly, Hindu deities. At the same time, in terms of soteriology,tantric Buddhism is capable of liberating even the most repulsive and pernicious ofbeings such as MaheŸvara and his ilk—even if they would rather die first.555While there are mentions of sanctioned violence in other early tantric materials, theCompendium of Principles’ account of Vajrap› ̊ı’s subjugation of MaheŸvara representsthe foundational myth for tantric Buddhist violence in India. This myth would appear,expanded, in later Indian tantric literature such as the Cakrasa ̇vara and Secret Nucleustantras, serving as a source of authenticity and authoritativeness.556 It is interesting tonote that, just as the narrative of ⁄›kyamuni’s enlightenment through the five manifestenlightenments found at the beginning of the Compendium of Principles presents tantrictechniques as the highest stratum of doctrine and practice within Buddhism, so too doesthe MaheŸvara subjugation myth present tantric Buddhism as superior to other forms ofreligion within India as a whole (here represented by MaheŸvara and his retinue of Hindudeities). Additionally, the enlightenment narrative represents a paradigm shift in terms ofthe liberative path from a solitary activity based on ethics, accomplishment in meditativeconcentration, and wisdom to the tantric project that requires a series of consecrationsfrom others into a prescribed series of ritual practices. The narrative of Vajrap› ̊i’ssubjugation of MaheŸvara contributes an important element to this new paradigm.   555 For a lengthier discussion of this aspect of the myth, see Ronald M. Davidson, “Reflections on theMaheŸvara Subjugation Myth: Indic Materials, Sa-skya-pa Apologetics, and the Birth of Heruka,” inJournal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, vol. 14, no. 2 (1991), pp. 215-217,\\; andRonald M.

One example of this isfound in the Skill in Means SÒtra, an early Mah›y›na text that, according to Mark Tatz,might date to as early as the first century BCE.557 This text includes a story of fivehundred merchants engaged in a trading mission who are traveling by ship.558 Thecaptain of the ship has a dream in which he understands that one of the merchants plansto kill all the others and steal their wealth. He also understands that all the merchants areBodhisattvas progressing towards enlightenment, and thus extremely heavy karmic non-virtue would accrue to the murderer and he would burn in hell for the cumulative lengthof time it took all the merchant-Bodhisattvas to achieve enlightenment. Seeing no otherway to prevent such an unfortunate occurrence, the captain out of compassion kills thewould-be murderer even while understanding that he will experience a long period in hellthe result of his action. However, the account concludes by saying that this action,because it was performed out of a compassionate motivation, actually propelled thecaptain toward enlightenment rather than landing him in hell.Thus, we see in this story a precedent in earlier Mah›y›na Buddhism for the tantricjustification of violence found in the MaheŸvara subjugation narrative in the   557 Mark Tatz, The Skill in Means (Up›yakauŸalya) SÒtra (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1994), p. 1.558 This is drawn from Tatz, Skill in Means, pp. 73-74.

We also see another aspect of one of the central aspects ofmature tantra, which Davidson identifies as the metaphor of coronation as a king and theexercise of this royal dominion. Additionally, we see another function of tantricnarrative: rearticulating the place of Buddhism in a changed socio-political world.“Liberation through Slaying” PracticesThe MaheŸvara subjugation account provides a mythological underpinning forpractices involving violence, which would proliferate in subsequent tantric developments.In addition to this seminal tantric Buddhist myth, we find other instances of fierceactivities in the Compendium of Principles. In the second section of the tantra, followingthe account of MaheŸvara’s subjugation, we find a passage in which, at the direction ofVairocana, Vajrap› ̊i (in the form of VajrahÒ ̇kara) draws up all beings in the threelower transmigrations (that is, hell-beings, hungry ghosts, and animals) and summonsthem to the outside of the ma ̊ ̃ala. He then instructs them to take refuge in the threejewels and to take the pledges and vows, which they do. Then Vajrap› ̊i sets forth themantra and mudr› of destroying misdeeds. Through merely seeing this mudr›, all beingsin bad transmigrations (Tib: ngan song; Skt: durgati) die, are reborn at the feet ofVairocana, and their old bodies are cast into the great ocean.At first glance this episode would seem to have little in common with Vajrap› ̊i’ssubjugation of MaheŸvara. However, upon closer inspection, we find the element ofmurder in the liberation of beings in bad transmigrations: immediately upon seeing themudr› of destroying misdeeds displayed by Vajrap› ̊i (while he simultaneously intonesthe appropriate mantra), these beings die. That is, the mudr› kills them: it causes them todie when they see it. It also causes them to be reborn at the feet of Vairocana in what wecan only assume is a Pure Land, whence they will speedily attain enlightenment. Thus, inthis brief episode we find another example from the second section of the Compendium of"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 194Principles of violence (and the extreme of murder) as a compassion-driven liberatingactivity.This is significant in that it reinforces the validation of certain kinds of violence incertain contexts as expressed in Vajrap› ̊i’s subjugation of MaheŸvara. The import ofthis brief passage goes beyond that, however, as violence proliferates in later Indiantantric literature such as the yoginı tantras. Additionally, in Tibet such “liberationthrough slaying” practices (Tib: sgrol ba) would come to be at the center of thecontroversy surrounding the interpretation and implementation of tantric practices duringthe ninth and tenth centuries (I will discuss this in chapter five; see pp. 309-312). To myknowledge, this passage in the Compendium of Principles represents the earliestarticulation of such “liberation through slaying” practices in Indian tantric Buddhistliterature. As such, we find here the germinal stage of “liberation through slaying”practices around which would later swirl one of the central controversies in the history ofTibetan Buddhism (and which we find mentions of in India in the context of the siddhafigures).Death PracticesThe practice of drawing up beings in bad states, purifying their karmic misdeedsthrough a mantra and mudr› pair, and dispatching them to rebirth in a Pure Land at thefeet of Vairocana—along with one element of Vajrap› ̊i’s subjugation ofMaheŸvara—represents the germinal stage of another important sphere of tantricBuddhist doctrinal and ritual life: practices concerned with the dead. In the passagedealing with beings in bad transmigrations, Vajrap› ̊i guides the consciousnesses of thesebeings to Vairocana’s Pure Land. We know that it is their consciousnesses that heguides: the text says their old bodies were discarded in the great ocean, and since it alsosays they were born at Vairocana’s feet, this must refer to their consciousnesses passingto a new lifetime.

After MaheŸvara has finally submitted, he becomes a Tath›gata wheninitiation is conferred on him through the sole of Vajrap› ̊i’s foot (as he stands onMaheŸvara). MaheŸvara is then born as the Tath›gata BhasmeŸvara-nirgho ̋a inBhasmacchatr› (a world-system far, far away). The narrative then continues with thedeities of MaheŸvara’s retinue (N›r›ya ̊a and so forth) being admitted into and initiatedin the Conquest over the Three Worlds (Trilokavijaya) Great Ma ̊ ̃ala. Vajrap› ̊isubsequently subdues various other pernicious beings (grahas, ̃›ki ̊ıs, and the like) whothen are brought into the Buddhist fold and take their places in the ma ̊ ̃ala. After theemanation of the three remaining Conquest over the Three Worlds ma ̊ ̃alas (theretention, doctrine, and action ma ̊ ̃alas) and the two abbreviated ma ̊ ̃alas (the four-mudr› and single-mudr› ma ̊ ̃alas), the Wheel of the Three Worlds (Trilokacakra)ma ̊ ̃alas—a second set of vajra-family ma ̊ ̃alas—are emanated.The scene for the emanation of the cycle of the Wheel of the Three Worlds ma ̊ ̃alasfinds Vajrap› ̊i still standing on the subjugated MaheŸvara’s corpse (althoughMaheŸvara’s consciousness has already become buddhified and gone to theBhasmacchatr› world-system). All the Tath›gatas gather and command Vajrap› ̊i to   559 In pre-tantric Pure Land Mah›y›na texts we find this theme of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas guidingdevotees to the Pure Land when they die. However, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do not kill thedevotees first in order to liberate them; rather, they guide devotees to the Pure Lands only after theyhave died.560 Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center, www.tbrc.org, P2636."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 196release MaheŸvara’s body. Vajrap› ̊i replies that he, having been consecrated thewrathful subduer of pernicious beings by the bhagavatas (blessed ones, viz., theassembled Tath›gatas), has slain MaheŸvara, so how can he release the body? All theTath›gatas then issue forth from their hearts the mantra for summoning the consciousnessof the deceased in order to revivify MaheŸvara’s body, and they also set forth acorresponding mudr›. The consciousness of the Buddha BhasmeŸvara-nirgho ̋a(MaheŸvara in his post-enlightenment form) re-enters MaheŸvara’s body and asks whyhis dead body has been reanimated.

Thispractice would come to have great importance in Tibet, particularly in the context of theindigenous “Liberation through Hearing in the Intermediate State” (bar do thos grol)genre of literature (the so-called “Tibetan Book of the Dead” literature) that woulddevelop in Tibet from the fourteenth century onward. It may be that we find in therevivification of MaheŸvara’s corpse the earliest instance in Indian tantric Buddhistliterature of the practice of summoning the consciousness of the deceased. This practicewould seem to be a natural (and perhaps necessary) complement to the practice found inthe Compendium of Principles, discussed above, of guiding the consciousnesses of beingsto a Pure Land rebirth, since for this to take place the consciousness must first besummoned before it can be guided. These two practices from the second section of theCompendium of Principles quite possibly represent Indian sources of the Tibetan “Bookof the Dead” system of doctrines and practices. Furthermore, they might well be thefoundational practices for later mortuary developments in Indian Buddhist tantra (inconjunction with the various homa rites for the deceased)."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 197Sexual YogaOne final topic that must be mentioned in this discussion of the Compendium ofPrinciples’ innovative features is sexo-yogic practice. Tibetan traditions hold that onlythe highest stratum of tantra includes practices involving sexual intercourse and the subtlebody.561 While desire may be used in the path of the lower tantras, practices involvingsexual union are said to be exclusive to Highest Yoga Tantra (in traditions employing thefourfold tantric doxography) or the vehicles of the three Inner Tantras of Mah›yoga,Anuyoga, and Atiyoga (in traditions employing a nine-vehicle doxography in whichtantra is divided into the six upper vehicles). None of these traditions ascribe practicesinvolving sexual union to the Compendium of Principles or texts they classify as YogaTantra.However, I have found in the Compendium of Principles the kernel of such practicesinvolving sexual intercourse. The specific phrase to which I refer here (Tib: dbang pognyis sbyor and dbang po gnyis sprad byed; Skt: dvayendriya-sam›patty›) literallytranslates as “joining the two organs,” which can denote sexual intercourse.562 This termoccurs in all four sections of the Compendium of Principles, usually in the context of“secret” activities (Tib: gsang ba’i phyag rgya, gsang ba’i dngos grub, and so on; Skt:guhya- or rahasya-mudr›, guhya-siddhi, and so on) and often in the presentation of thesingle-mudr› ma ̊ ̃ala.563 The term sometimes occurs in conjunction with rites for   561 Such practices generally include manipulation of the energies or winds (Skt: pr› ̊a; Tib: rlung), thechannels (Skt: n› ̃i; Tib: rtsa), and the drops (Skt: bindu; Tib: thig le).562 Also, in contemporary traditions of the Geluk school of Tibetan Buddhism, this term—dbang po gnyissbyor—is used specifically to refer to sexual intercourse in the context of tantra.563 Snellgrove briefly mentions the existence of sexual practices in the Compendium of Principles in hisintroduction to the tantra (Snellgrove, Facsimile Reproduction, pp. 37-38)."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 198attracting females (that is, in the context of love spells and the like).564 D›nap›la’s (Shih-hu) Chinese translation of the entire Compendium of Principles, which is a rather latework (1015 CE),565 translates this term literally as “vajra and lotus, the two having beenconjoined.”566 What is interesting here is the usage of the term “vajra and lotus.” Whilethis is not found in the Compendium of Principles, tantras which date to the latter part ofthe eighth century onward, such as the Secret Nucleus Tantra, employ “vajra and lotus”for penis and vagina in the context of practices involving sexual intercourse. D›nap›lauses the term at the beginning of the eleventh century, by which time the sexualconnotation (or even denotation) of “vajra and lotus” was firmly established in Indiantantra. In addition, he chose to use “joining vajra and lotus” rather than “joining the twoorgans” which, based on the Tibetan translation and extant Sanskrit manuscripts, is howthe Sanskrit text read. D›nap›la appears to have selected a translation term with the mostexplicit sexual connotation. Therefore, it seems clear from the Sanskrit as well as theTibetan and Chinese translations that this phrase in the Compendium of Principles refersto sexual intercourse.The Indian tantric exegete ⁄›kyamitra explains the term “joining the two organs”basically as the tantric practice of deity yoga. He identifies the two organs as thepractitioner’s organ and the deity’s organ—“organ” is used here in the sense of“mind”)—which are joined “as one taste.” That is, the practitioner mixes her or his mind   564 Ronald Davidson has noted the existence of such rites for attracting females (albeit non-human ones) forsexual purposes as a means to attain feats (siddhi) already in the early Questions of Sub›hu Tantra(Toh. 805, 138b.6-139a.4; cited in Davidson, Indian Esoteric Buddhism, pp. 198 & 385, n. 90).565 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” n. 13, p. 127.566 chin-kang lien-hua erh hsiang ko (T. vol. 18, No. 882, 365c.16-23).

Davidson cites tantricsexual rites in texts such as the Secret Assembly and the Yoga of the Equality of AllBuddhas.569 I believe that the Compendium of Principles represents one of the earliestexplicit descriptions of such rites involving sacramental sex.570 We must not overlookthe significance of these practices in the Compendium of Principles. Traditionaldelineations of the categories of Mah›yoga and Highest Yoga Tantra as involving sexo-yogic practices employing sexual intercourse while all lower classes of tantra do not mustbe reevaluated.

Research into the contents of the tantra itself is necessary.569 Davidson, Indian Esoteric Buddhism, p. 198.570 Davidson cites as an early example of a sexual ritual a passage in the Questions of Sub›hu Tantra thatdescribes rites for attracting non-human females to a secluded place for the purpose of gaining magicalfeats through copulation (Davidson, Indian Esoteric Buddhism, p. 198)."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 200It is not until later tantric developments, however, that sexual rites are combined withpractices involving the yogic body, such as the manipulation of subtle energies throughthe channels in which they flow, psychophysical yogic centers (cakras) visualized in thebody’s interior, and so forth.571 I have found no evidence of practices involve the subtlebody in the Compendium of Principles. However, we do find practices involvingvisualization within the body. The five manifest enlightenments, for instance, begin witha moon disc visualized at the practitioner’s heart, and continue with a series of internalvisualizations. While similar visualization practices may occur in other early tantras suchas the Concentration Continuation Tantra, I believe that the Compendium of Principles isthe first text that contains both inner visualization and sexual rites. Although these willnot be united into a single practice until later tantras, their occurrence in the Compendiumof Principles suggests a possible source for such practices.The Compendium of Principles’ Transitional StatusAs Stephen Hodge, David Snellgrove, and others have noted, the Compendium ofPrinciples succeeds the Manifest Enlightenment of Vairocana Tantra and precedes theSecret Assembly Tantra, Hevajra Tantra, and so forth in the development from threeBuddha-family (Tib: rigs; Skt: kula) systems to five Buddha-family systems. While thema ̊ ̃alas of the Compendium of Principles present deities arranged in terms of fiveBuddha families, it is important to note that divisions in the Compendium of Principlesprimarily come in sets of four.

This five-stepprocedure is the paradigmatic contemplative process by which ⁄›kyamuni attainedenlightenment, and it constitutes the fundamental practice of the Compendium ofPrinciples. In the commentarial literature the five manifest enlightenments are alsocorrelated with the five aspects of a Buddha’s enlightened wisdom, namely, the mirror-like wisdom, wisdom of equality, wisdom of individual analysis, wisdom of achievingactivities, and the wisdom of the element of qualities; each of these correspond to one ofthe five Buddha families.Additionally, the various ma ̊ ̃alas of each of the four sections of the Compendium ofPrinciples are structured around five Buddha figures—the central figure surrounded byBuddhas in each of the four cardinal directions—and around each of these Buddhas arearranged the deities of their respective Buddha family. Thus, in the ma ̊ ̃alas of theCompendium of Principles we find a five Buddha family-system—the four Buddhafamilies listed above joined by the action (karma) Buddha family. We also find a shift inthe central figure of the ma ̊ ̃ala. In earlier tantras ⁄›kyamuni occupies the centralposition, but the pivot of the ma ̊ ̃alas of the Compendium of Principles is Vairocana,completing the shift initiated in the Manifest Enlightenment of Vairocana Tantra.572   572 In later tantras such as the Cakrasa ̇vara, deities of the wrathful vajra family, in union with their femaleconsorts, assume the central position of the ma ̊ ̃ala. This movement is perhaps prefigured in the fivefour-mudr› ma ̊ ̃alas of each section of the Compendium of Principles.

The individual ma ̊ ̃alas of theCompendium of Principles, however, are structured around five Buddha families, at thehead of each of which is a Buddha (Vairocana, Ak ̋obhya, Amit›bha, Ratnasambhava,and Amoghasiddhi). Indian commentarial traditions were aware of this tension betweenthe pervasive fourfold structure of the tantra and the fivefold organization of theindividual ma ̊ ̃alas. As Butön relates, they addressed this tension by interpreting thefourth section of the tantra in two ways: taken as enlightened action from the viewpointof agent, it is the jewel Buddha family, at the head of which is the BuddhaRatnasambhava; taken as enlightened action from the viewpoint of activity, it is theaction Buddha family, at the head of which is the Buddha Amoghasiddhi.573 Thus,according to this exegetical tradition, all five Buddha families are present not only ineach of the ma ̊ ̃alas of the Compendium of Principles but also in the body of the tantraitself—the four sections of the tantra. Although one Buddha family predominates in eachof the four sections, this allows the fifth family—the action family—to be present in thefourth section. In this interpretation, the five Buddha families are therefore present in thefour sections that comprise the body of the Compendium of Principles even though theaction family is not explicitly described or mentioned.Butön does not state where this exegetical tradition originates; rather, he says this canbe understood from another Yoga Tantra, the ⁄rı Param›dya.574 The Tibetan savant       of the vajra family at its center, and thus could have been a forerunner of the shift to ma ̊ ̃alas arrayedaround a vajra-family deity.

Of the twelve ma ̊ ̃alas found in this tantra,seven have at their center Vajrap› ̊i, the lead Bodhisattva of the vajra family.573 Butön, Extensive Explanation, 43a.7 -43b.1.574 Butön, Extensive Explanation, 43a.7 -43b.1."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 203Tsongkapa (1357-1419), a scholar of the generation succeeding Butön and founder of theGelukpa school of Tibetan Buddhism, attributes this interpretation to Buddhaguhya.575Tsongkapa likely had in mind the following passage from this eighth-century Indianmaster’s commentary on the Compendium of Principles:576When condensed and taught they are taught as the four families. The actionfamily is not differentiated separately in the Compendium of Principles; it isincluded within the [jewel] family. How? The character of the preciousaggregation of unsurpassed marks and signs—the nature of the enlightenedbody of all conquerors—is Vajraratna.

Theproduction of explanatory tantras is a major development in Indian Buddhist tantra, asthey create the earliest cycles of closely and explicitly related tantra texts. In terms ofdating these explanatory tantras, the Indian tantric master and translator Amoghavajra, inhis mid-eighth century Chinese text, discusses the Conquest over the Three Worlds andthe two component parts of the VajraŸekhara Tantra among the eighteen tantras of theVajraŸekhara cycle,577 so we can conclude with some confidence that these explanatorytantras were in existence by this time at the latest (although perhaps not yet in their finalform).Furthermore, the eighth-century Tibetan text Garland of Views: Esoteric Instructions,attributed to the Indian tantric master Padmasambhava, quotes a four-line stanza from atext identified by the eleventh-century Tibetan scholar Rongzom Chökyi Zangpo (Rongzom Chos kyi bzang po)578 as the Conquest over the Three Realms.

This lengthy exposition expandsupon a brief description of the proper mode of conduct for tantric practitioners found in atleast one place in the Compendium of Principles.580 The VajraŸekhara Tantra’spresentation is significant not only for its depth but also because its elucidation of therequired and prohibited activities for each of the Buddha families individually is likelythe first of its kind found in a Buddhist tantra itself.A third explanatory tantra of the Compendium of Principles, the All Secret Tantra, isprobably a somewhat later composition. The All Secret Tantra has a section on theVajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala, and thus is associated with the first section of the Compendium ofPrinciples. However, one of the distinctive features of the All Secret Tantra is itsemployment of the Sanskrit terms bhaga and liºga, which in the Tibetan translation arerendered as transliterations rather than as translations. In later tantras involving sexo-yogic practices the terms bhaga and liºga are used for vagina and penis, respectively, and   579 The translation of the Conquest over the Three Worlds Great King of Procedures in the various editionsof the Tibetan canon unfortunately does not have a colophon. Thus, it does not identify the translators ofthe text, a key piece of evidence for establishing the date of a translation.580 Snellgrove, Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, vol. 1, pp. 175-176.

However, bhaga and liºga likelywere not employed with these meanings in Buddhist tantra until some time after thedevelopment of the doctrines and practices of the Compendium of Principles. Theirusage in the All Secret Tantra—in the line “Having inserted the liºga into thebhaga”—suggests that this text belongs to the later stratum of Buddhist tantra. Thisargument is supported by the fact that there is controversy within Buddhist traditions overwhether the All Secret Tantra is a Yoga Tantra or a Highest Yoga Tantra.The explanatory Yoga Tantras represent important developments in Indian Buddhisttantra. The Conquest over the Three Worlds Great King of Procedures and theVajraŸekhara Tantra are likely the earliest explanatory tantras to develop in IndianBuddhism, and the latter is likely the earliest explanatory tantra commenting on an entiretantra. This is a significant development, as with it the sense of an interrelated corpus oftantras emerges. The VajraŸekhara Tantra explicitly and self-consciously comments onthe Compendium of Principles. The tradition states that this is its very function: theVajraŸekhara Tantra was taught subsequent to the Compendium of Principles for thepurpose of explaining and clarifying it. This establishes Yoga Tantra as a cycle of relatedtexts in constellation around the central Yoga Tantra the Compendium of Principles,rather than being merely a collection of individual tantras that might have some commonelements but the inter-textual relationships of which are neither explicitly stated norclearly discernible. Significantly, this establishes within the field of Indian Buddhisttantra a true corpus of tantras. The presence of the Conquest over the Three WorldsGreat King of Procedures, a second explanatory tantra that clearly and self-consciouslyexplicates the second section of the Compendium of Principles and probably predates theVajraŸekhara, and also the presence of the All Secret Tantra further solidify the sense ofYoga Tantra as an integrated cycle of related texts, doctrines, and practices."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 207The genre of explanatory tantras becomes a mainstay in Indian Buddhist tantrasubsequent to its development in the Yoga Tantra corpus.

In fact, the eighth-century Indian tantric exegete Buddhaguhya divides thebody of the text thematically into ma ̊ ̃alas and homa rites (that is, rites involving fireofferings).

Theframe-story of the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations, which sets the tone and thecontext for the entire text, revolves around funerary rites. The god Vimalama ̊iprabhadies from the Heaven of the Thirty Three, and ⁄akra (aka Indra, the king of the gods) andhis other heavenly compatriots, concerned about their friend’s fate, ask the BuddhaVairocana where he has taken rebirth. Vairocana informs them that Vimalama ̊iprabhahas been reborn in the Most Tortuous Hell (Tib: mnar med; Skt: avıci). Then, in responseto ⁄akra’s request for assistance, Vairocana emanates the Sarvavid Vairocana Ma ̊ ̃ala582and teaches ⁄akra its rituals in order to aid Vimalama ̊iprabha. ⁄akra then performsthese rites, through which Vimalama ̊iprabha is liberated from hell and is reborn inTu ̋ita Heaven.It is significant that the purpose of the first and central of the twelve ma ̊ ̃alas of thePurification of All Bad Transmigrations583 is the purification of sins and badtransmigrations specifically in the context of a funerary rite. Further importance is givento this ma ̊ ̃ala as it is the only one of the twelve ma ̊ ̃alas in the Purification of All BadTransmigrations for which Vairocana himself serves as the creator of the ma ̊ ̃ala andthe teacher of its attendant rites (the Bodhisattva Vajrap› ̊i emanates and teaches theother eleven ma ̊ ̃alas set forth in the tantra).   581 Skorupski, SarvadurgatipariŸodhana, p. xxvii.582 In the later version of the tantra the ma ̊ ̃ala is the Nine Crown Protuberances Ma ̊ ̃ala, also known asthe Purification of All Bad Transmigrations Ma ̊ ̃ala.583 This refers to the earlier version of the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations, P116. The later versionof the tantra (P117) has eleven ma ̊ ̃alas."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 209While Buddhist funerary rites in India certainly predate the Purification of All BadTransmigrations, this tantra represents a major innovation because it contains death ritesthat employ cutting-edge tantric technologies. We find such rites for the deceased ininchoate form in the Compendium of Principles: in the second section there is a briefmention of a rite for summoning all beings in bad transmigrations, purifying theirnegative karma, and dispatching them to a rebirth in a Pure Land. These practices,however, come to full tantric flower in the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations, inwhich ⁄akra performs the practices of the Sarvavid Vairocana Ma ̊ ̃ala expressly as afunerary rite to benefit the deceased god Vimalama ̊iprabha,584 and the general purposeof the rite is explained as purifying past karma that will result in rebirth in one of thethree bad transmigrations. Moreover, such death rites occur in the body of the tantraitself585 and are not relegated to supplementary sections of the text (as we find with theManifest Enlightenment of Vairocana) or to extra-textual liturgical literature (as we findwith the Compendium of Principles). Hence, for what is likely the first time, thePurification of All Bad Transmigrations presents rites for the deceased within the contextof the latest in Buddhist tantric procedures—deity yoga and ma ̊ ̃ala practice.Additionally, in the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations funerary rites areemphasized further still. Not only do we find rites for the dead in the first chapter of the   584 Butön further elaborates on these rites—stating that Vairocana teaches to ⁄akra the purification of sinsand so forth—and describes them as “the methods—which are activities when there is a corpse andwhen there is not a corpse—for purifying bad transmigrations” (de nas brgya byin gyis ngan songsbyong ba’i thabs zhus pa/ dbang bskur te sdig pa sbyong ba la sogs pa ro yod pa dang med pa la byaba’i ngan song sbyong thabs rnams gsungs pa, Butön, Ship, 39a.7-39b.1).585 We also find death rites, along with an explanation of the benefits that accrue to the deceased throughperforming various rites, in other parts of the tantra, such as the teaching of the ⁄›kyamuni Ma ̊ ̃ala andits attendant rites (Butön, Ship, 39b.4), the teaching of the Amit›yus Ma ̊ ̃ala and its attendant rites(Butön, Ship, 40a.6), and so forth."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 210tantra; we find them also in the practices of the first ma ̊ ̃ala—the central and mostimportant ma ̊ ̃ala of the entire tantra.One way to interpret the inclusion of and emphasis on death rites in the Purification ofAll Bad Transmigrations is as an attempt to establish tantric Buddhism in the death-ritualspace: funerary rites explicitly formulated and identified as such. The frame-story of thetantra, however, suggests that a greater claim is being made: the superiority of these newBuddhist tantric funerary technologies over the death rites of brahmanical traditions. Inthe narrative Indra, the king of the Vedic pantheon, and his fellow residents in theHeaven of the Thirty Three are powerless to help their deceased colleagueVimalama ̊iprabha (and in fact do not even know into which realm he has been reborn).They must seek the aid of the tantric Buddha Vairocana, who first locates their fallenfriend in the Most Tortuous Hell and then sets forth a ma ̊ ̃ala and prescribes rites toperform for his benefit. Indra performs these specifically Buddhist tantric rites, throughwhich Vimalama ̊iprabha is liberated from hell and is reborn in a heaven.We see in this frame-story an implicit claim to the superiority of Buddhist tantrictechniques in the field of funeral rites. This claim parallels the claim to the superiority ofBuddhist tantra in general over that of Hindu traditions, and particularly over ⁄aivitesects, made in the MaheŸvara subjugation narrative found in the Compendium ofPrinciples. When we consider this in light of the social context in which Buddhismdeveloped in India, discussed above (declining patronage and so forth), the claim tosuperiority in the field of death rites takes on even more significance. There can be littledoubt about the cultural cash value of such rites since the demand for death rites is one ofthe few societal constants, particularly in Indian civilization. A religion strugglingeconomically that could increase its share of the lucrative funeral market stood to gainenormously. This is not to say that a conscious decision was made by Buddhist"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 211monastics to increase their presence in the field of death rites, but we cannot ignore thepossible economic ramifications of such rites for the viability of Buddhist institutions.In addition to funerary rites, many practices taught in the Purification of All BadTransmigrations are for practical purposes. While we also find rites for worldly purposesscattered throughout the Compendium of Principles, the situation in the Purification ofAll Bad Transmigrations is rather different. Six of the nine ma ̊ ̃alas that comprise thesecond chapter (the Ma ̊ ̃ala of the Four Great Kings, the Ma ̊ ̃ala of the Guardians ofthe Ten Directions, the Ma ̊ ̃ala of the Eight Planets together with the Constellations, theMa ̊ ̃ala of the Eight Great N›gas, the Ma ̊ ̃ala of the Eight Bhairavas, and the Ma ̊ ̃alaof the Eight Great Gods) are considered to be worldly ma ̊ ̃alas, according to thefourteenth/fifteenth-century Tibetan scholar Tsongkapa.586 Rites for worldly purposes,including the well-known tetrad of pacification of illness, increasing resources,controlling others, and violently subduing others, are also found in several ma ̊ ̃alas ofthe Purification of All Bad Transmigrations.One interpretation of the preponderance of such rites is as a parallel to the importancedeath rites play in the tantra: a proliferation of rites for practical purposes desired by a laypublic could boost the revenue-generating capacity of Buddhist institutions finding itincreasingly difficult to replenish their contracting coffers. Again, I am not claiming thatthis was the intention behind the formulation of such rites and the production of textssuch as the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations, but we cannot ignore the potentialeconomic impact of such rites on Buddhist monastic communities.In this vein, there is another aspect of the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations thatis significant. In the six ma ̊ ̃alas of the tantra’s second chapter enumeratedabove—from the Ma ̊ ̃ala of the Four Great Kings through the Ma ̊ ̃ala of the Eight   586 Skorupski, SarvadurgatipariŸodhana, p. 49, n. 34."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 212Great Gods—the residents of the ma ̊ ̃ala are not Buddhist deities. Rather, they aredivine and semi-divine agents such as n›gas, the guardians of the ten directions, theplanets and constellations, and so forth considered in Indian culture to be responsible forvarious maladies that afflict individuals. The manipulation of such forces dates to theVedic period in India and so there was nothing novel about it in seventh- or eighth-century India. Additionally, Buddhist dh›ra ̊ıs whose purpose was to counteract andcontrol such forces had been around for centuries. However, what is innovative aboutpractices found in the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations and other texts is theiremployment of emerging Buddhist tantric technologies for such purposes.Furthermore, the six ma ̊ ̃alas from the second chapter of the Purification of All BadTransmigrations, mentioned above, are perhaps unique in another way. As the Tibetanscholiast Tsongkapa says, these six are mundane ma ̊ ̃alas,587 which means they areemployed for worldly ends rather than for soteriological ones. Whereas other ma ̊ ̃alasof the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations—such as the ma ̊ ̃alas of SarvavidVairocana and Vajrap› ̊i—demonstrate a five Buddha-family structure such as is foundin the Compendium of Principles, the six ma ̊ ̃alas described above do not. Rather, thestructure of each of these ma ̊ ̃alas is idiosyncratic (four great kings, eight planets, tenguardians of the directions, and so forth).There is nothing in these six ma ̊ ̃alas that qualifies them as specifically Buddhist,save one important feature: Vajrap› ̊i is at the center of each of the six ma ̊ ̃alas. Thus,it is possible that the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations represents an attempt toincorporate rites for controlling various forces believed in Indian culture to impinge onthe everyday life of individuals into a Buddhist context by including them in a text underthe auspices of the nascent Buddhist cult of Vairocana. This assimilation is further   587 Skorupski, SarvadurgatipariŸodhana, p. 49, n. 34."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 213strengthened by inserting the important Buddhist tantric deity Vajrap› ̊i into the center ofeach of these ma ̊ ̃alas of pan-Indian forces that affect/ afflict individuals. This not onlyputs a Buddhist stamp on practices related to otherwise pan-Indian (and not specificallyBuddhist) divine and semi-divine figures, it also creates the semblance of a Buddhistworld-order with the tantric figure Vajrap› ̊i at the center of, and reigning over, theseforces. The fact that these ma ̊ ̃alas are included in a text the frame-story of whichpresents the new tantric Buddhist death-rites as superior to those of the brahmanicaltraditions and deities such as Indra is a further claim to a re-ordered Indian ritual worlddominated by tantric Buddhist procedures.In addition to the above practices, we also find at points in the first and third chaptersof the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations the prescription of fire offering rites (sbyinsreg, homa). Buddhaguhya describes these rites, common also to Hindu ⁄›kta and Tantratraditions, as being of two types: those for saving the deceased from rebirth in badtransmigrations and those associated with the four rites of pacification of illness and soforth (zhi ba, Ÿ›nti), increase of resources (rgyas pa, pau ̋ ̨ika), control of others (dbang,vaŸıkara ̊a), and violent subjugation (drag po or mngon spyod, abhic›raka),588 whichoften means killing. These four rites are directed toward specific worldly aims and arepart of the larger Indian ritual repertoire.In the ma ̊ ̃alas and practices of the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations we findthe articulation of Buddhist tantric technologies in the field of funeral rites, and suchpractices occupy a prominent and privileged position in the tantra. We also find thedeployment of ma ̊ ̃alas consisting of Vajrap› ̊i surrounded by an assortment of divineand semi-divine figures believed to affect (and afflict) a variety of aspects of the daily life   588 This discussion of Buddhaguhya’s thematic exegesis is drawn from Skorupski,SarvadurgatipariŸodhana, p. xxvii."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 214of individuals. Additionally, we find the deployment of a set of four rites, also found inother Indian religious traditions, for the benefit of the deceased as well as for variousworldly ends for the living.While the factors influencing the development the Purification of All BadTransmigrations are multifarious and complex, and while we must be careful not to driftinto an overly (or exclusively) functionalist interpetation, the economic implications ofsuch rituals cannot be ignored. If the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations’employment of tantric practices in death rites increased the Buddhist presence in thelucrative funerary field, this certainly would have positively affected the monastic bottomline and the viability of Buddhist institutions suffering from a decline in patronage.Additionally, the ma ̊ ̃alas and related practices of the Purification of All BadTransmigrations cover a range of ritual needs beyond funerary rites; this too was apotential source of increased revenue, as the inclusion of such rituals thereby addressedmore widely the ritual needs of a population whose patronage of Buddhism wasdeclining.589More generally, it is also possible that the Purification of All Bad Transmigrationsrepresents a tantric Buddhist attempt (self-conscious or not) to become a player in thebroader Indian ritual sphere. With the activities of Buddhist logicians such as Dign›gaand especially Dharmakırti (c. 650 CE), Buddhism engaged the pan-Indianepistemological discourse and employed its vocabulary and nomenclature.590 This sameperiod produced the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations, with its adoption of pan-   589 Elements of the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations appear also in Indonesia (Max Nihom, Studiesin Indian and Indo-Indonesian Tantra: The Kuñjarakar ̊adharmakathana and the Yogatantra [Vienna:Sammlung de Nobili Institut für Indologie der Universität Wien, 1994], chapter 2), perhaps again due totheir utility in death rites and other worldly rituals.590 Davidson, Indian Esoteric Buddhism, pp. 102-104."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 215Indian rituals including fire offerings, rites to supplicate forces such as n›gas, the eightplanets, and so forth. This perhaps represents a parallel in the ritual sphere to theBuddhist entry into the broader Indian philosophical discourse, as many of the practicesset forth in the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations appear to employ pan-Indian“vocabulary and nomenclature” at the ritual level.It is interesting to note here the existence of a commentarial tradition that treated thePurification of All Bad Transmigrations as a Performance Tantra. Leonard van der Kuijppoints out that this stream of interpretation, recorded in the twelfth- or early thirteenth-century Tibetan commentary on the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations by the Sakyahierarch Jetsün Drakpa Gyeltsen (rJe btsun Grags pa rgyal mtshan, 1147-1216), is notseen after Drakpa Gyeltsen’s time591 (although Butön does refer to it).592 Perhaps thistantra represents a transition between the earlier stratum of tantra concerned mainly withpractical, worldly objectives and the Compendium of Principles and its shift to innercontemplation and soteriological goals.In this context a view expressed in the Ornament of Illumination (sNang ba’i rgyan,filok›laªk›ra, P3454), an Indian commentary on the Purification of All BadTransmigrations Tantra, is perhaps significant. The unidentified author of this exegesisexpounds upon the tantra in terms of a threefold division, correlating the sections of thetext with the three Buddha familes, three mudr›s, and the triad body-speech-mind(Skorupski, SarvadurgatipariŸodhana, pp. xxvii-xxviii). This association of a YogaTantra with a three-family system, which predominates in the Manifest Enlightenment ofVairocana and other early tantras later classified under the rubric of Performance Tantra,raises interesting questions. Perhaps it indicates not only the early date of the production   591 van der Kuijp, “SarvadurgatipariŸodhana in Tibet,” pp. 117-118.592 Butön, Ship, 76b.7."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 216of the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations but also its transitional status as a tantrathat, while related to the Compendium of Principles in terms of its central ma ̊ ̃ala (bothare of the great ma ̊ ̃ala type, and the central deity of both is a form of Vairocana) and itspractices (it expands on the practice, found in inchoate form in the second section of theCompendium of Principles, of purifying the negative karma of beings in badtransmigrations and liberating them from their suffering circumstances), still containsstrands of earlier strata of tantra.In this context we must also keep in mind a threefold structure found in theCompendium of Principles itself. One way of categorizing the practices presented ineach of the four sections of the tantra is into three meditative stabilizations (Tib: ting nge’dzin; Skt: sam›dhi), which perhaps is a vestige of earlier three Buddha-family systems.The rubric of three meditative stabilizations persisted in Buddhist tantric developmentssubsequent to the Yoga Tantras, as it is found in texts of the Highest Yoga Tantra class aswell.Before leaving this discussion of the innovations and importance of the Purification ofAll Bad Transmigrations, one final remark is in order. The number of commentaries andritual texts related to the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations (as preserved in Tibetantranslation) exceeds the number of exegetical works related to the Compendium ofPrinciples, which is the root tantra of the Yoga Tantra class. While I do not want toattribute too much importance to a quantitative measure of the exegetical corpus of thePurification of All Bad Transmigrations, I do think it is significant in this regard: itappears that the text and its system of practices became quite popular in India, asevidenced by the large body of commentarial literature it engendered.593 I conclude,   593 The tantra appears to have achieved at least a degree of prominence relatively early, as the eighth-century Indian scholiast Buddhaguhya sent his commentary on the Purification of All Bad"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Import and Innovations 217although somewhat tentatively, that at least one factor in the popularity of thePurification of All Bad Transmigrations was its utility in a wide range of rituals. Themost important of these functions was likely as a death rite, but its ritual versatility wasalso significant, addressing a multiplicity of needs—from curing disease to securingresources to overcoming enemies to avoiding untimely death and extending the lifespan.This ability to address a broad spectrum of the lay population’s ritual needs likelycontributed to the popularity of the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations, particularlysince this extensive ritual repertoire carried with it the potential for increasing the incomeof Buddhist institutions facing economic difficulties due to a decline in patronage andother factors.ConclusionThe Compendium of Principles represents the announcement of the revolution that isBuddhist tantra. It combines a number of innovative practices and doctrines in a complexblend of narratives and rituals. While, as Davidson argues, several of these aspectsreflect the fractious socio-political Indian landscape in which Buddhist tantra developed,the roots of some of these innovations can be traced to earlier Mah›y›na traditions. Inaddition, several of these innovations represent in embryonic form importantaspects—such as practices involving violence and sexual intercourse—that woulddevelop in later Buddhist tantras. Moreover, the body of texts that grew out of theCompendium of Principles—later designated as Yoga Tantra—represents the first truecorpus in Indian Buddhist tantra.

The evidence wehave from south Indian traditions, as preserved in Chinese materials of the eighthcentury, reflects another organizational logic: that of an eighteen-text corpus that partiallyoverlaps with the texts identified as Yoga Tantra.

In the introductory section of the tantra there is a litany of the attributesand epithets of Vairocana. Among these is the term “mah›yogıŸvara” (“lord of greatyogıs” or “great lord of yogıs”).598 The Tibetan translation of the term is rnal ’byor chenpo’i dbang phyug,599 which should render the Sanskrit “mah›yogeŸvara” (“lord of greatyoga” or “great lord of yoga”) but could also translate “mah›yogıŸvara” (“lord of greatyogıs”/ “great lord of yogıs”). Since the meaning of “yogı” is “one who has yoga,” themeaning of “mah›yogıŸvara” (“lord of those who have great yoga)” comes very close tothe meaning of “mah›yogeŸvara” (“lord of great yoga”), and the bivalent Tibetantranslation bears this out.Additional support for this interpretation is found in ⁄›kyamitra’s Kosala Ornament,the word-by-word commentary on the Compendium of Principles preserved only in itsTibetan translation.

Vajrabodhi may also use the term in a similar way. Thus,early- to mid-eighth-century tantric traditions from south India, as preserved in Chinesetexts, appear to employ the term “mah›yoga” with an adjectival meaning. A thoroughsearch for the term in early Chinese tantric materials, which is beyond both my linguisticabilities and the scope of this work, remains a desideratum.The Term “Mah›yoga” in Dynastic Period TibetBefore we look at the more specific usage of the term “mah›yoga” I will brieflyreview the usage of “yoga.” It seems reasonable to think that, when the Compendium ofPrinciples and other Yoga Tantras emerged on the cutting edge of tantric technologies inlate seventh and early eighth-century India, the name “yoga” would have been used as ageneral term for tantra. Evidence from Chinese materials supports such a supposition.Of the eighteen texts that comprise the VajraŸekhara tantric cycle described byAmoghavajra, all but the first (the Compendium of Principles) are titled “yoga” (Chi: yü-ch’ieh), which is used in place of “sÒtra/scripture” (Chi: ching) or, in later parlance,tantra. Rolf Giebel suggests that the texts to which Amoghavajra refers were Indianritual manuals and therefore their titles end in “yoga.”611 Be that as it may, it is notdifficult to imagine extending “yoga” from a name for Yoga Tantra texts to a generalterm for tantra, since at that time Yoga Tantra represented the latest in tantric procedures.   609 Ching-kang-ting yü-ch’ieh chung lüeh-ch’u nien-sung ching (T.

When we examine the use of the term “mah›yoga” inTibetan texts dating to the first dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet (roughly spanning theperiod from the beginning of the eighth century until the middle of the ninth century), wefind a semantic range that, while including the meanings employed in early Indian tantricmaterials discussed above, also goes beyond them. Drawing mainly on Tun-huangmanuscripts, Kenneth Eastman states that in imperial Tibet “mah›yoga” was sometimesused as a general term for tantric Buddhism—and indeed that in some contexts “yoga”was used in the same way.612In addition, Eastman also discusses texts from Tun-huang in which “mah›yoga”appears as a category term. He notes that the Questions and Answers of Vajrasattva613 inits first sentence refers to itself as “an exposition of Mah›yoga.”614 The text thenaddresses fundamental aspects of Mah›yoga, and in the colophon again employs the term“mah›yoga” in the sense of a system (rather than just as a particular advanced meditativetechnique as we saw in earlier Indian materials), referring to itself as “a compendium ofthe extensive Mah›yoga.”615 While the author of this text is the Tibetan Pelyang (dPaldbyangs),616 it is thought to represent Indian Mah›yoga traditions transmitted to Tibetduring the imperial period of the eighth or early ninth centuries.   612 Kenneth W.

It seems likely that those responsible forthe composition and promulgation of such texts employed the term “mah›yoga” in anattempt not only to differentiate them from previous texts and practices but also to claimsuperiority as the latest tantric modality, superseding Yoga Tantra systems. DavidGermano has suggested that the development of tantric doctrine and practice beyond thatof the Yoga Tantras was termed “mah›yoga” (“great yoga”) in the sense of “super” or“super-charged Yoga [Tantra].”617 Additionally, as was the case with the term “yoga” (or“Yoga Tantra”), “mah›yoga” was also used to refer to tantra in general.Mah›yoga as a Doxographical CategoryI have just discussed the use of the term “mah›yoga” as a system of Buddhist tantra inTun-huang texts that date to the eighth or ninth century. I will now examine “mah›yoga”as a doxographical category. The earliest usage of the term in a tantra occurs in theLitany of Names of MañjuŸrı. This important early tantra dates to the late seventh orearly eighth century and is included in several different tantric categories, including YogaTantra and Mah›yoga (where it is known as the MañjuŸrı Magical Emanation Net). Thecolophon to this text identifies it as part of a larger text, the Superior Magical EmanationNet in 16,000 stanzas, which it identifies as a mah›yogatantra.618 It is not clear herewhether this term has the sense of “super Yoga Tantra” or Mah›yoga as a category oftantra. However, its occurrence within a discussion of a Magical Emanation Net text—a   617 David Germano, “The Seven Descents and the Early History of Rnying ma Transmissions,” in TheMany Canons of Tibetan Buddhism: Proceedings of the Ninth Seminar of the International Associationfor Tibetan Studies, eds. Helmut Eimer & David Germano (Leiden-Boston-Köln: EJ Brill, 2002), p.231; and personal communication, 2 May 2002.618 Davidson, “Names of MañjuŸrı,” p. 45."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 227Mah›yoga tantra—suggests that its meaning was tending toward Mah›yoga as a type oftantra.As intriguing as the presence of the term “mah›yoga tantra” in the Litany of Names ofMañjuŸrı is, it does not occur within a doxographical discussion. The Indian tantricexegete Amoghavajra, whose eighteen-text VajraŸekhara Yoga cycle includes texts thatwould later be classified as Yoga Tantra as well as texts that would be classified asMah›yoga, did not distinguish between types of tantras. Amoghavajra’s text does notdiscuss doxographical categories at all, and in fact he does not even use the term “YogaTantra.”619 Similarly, Jñ›namitra does not make category distinctions in his discussion ofan eighteen-tantra cycle (which I will discuss later in this chapter). Thus, we canconclude that in India (or at least in certain regions) during the first half of the eighthcentury there was a body of tantras that was not divided into hierarchical categories.The first record of such a structuring of Indian tantra dates to the middle of the eighthcentury, when Buddhaguhya employed a three-tiered tantric doxography with YogaTantra at its summit. In the latter half of the eighth century, in a text preserved in Tibetanattributed to the Indian tantric adept Padmasambhava (said to be a student ofBuddhaguhya), we find a proto-nine vehicle doxographical presentation in which YogaTantra is expanded to incorporate new tantric developments. Scholars have raisedquestions concerning the Indian provenance of this important text, the Garland of Views:Esoteric Instructions, so the following discussion and conclusions should be taken withqualification.In the Garland of Views, Yoga Tantra is considered the highest class (as is the casewith Buddhaguhya’s threefold doxography), although it is subdivided into Outer Yoga   619 None of the titles of the eighteen texts include the word “tantra”; all of them end in “-yoga” (with theexception of the first, which ends in “-kalpa”), and the entire cycle is called the “VajraŸekhara Yoga.”"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 228and Inner Yoga.620 The former, described as the vehicle of the tantra of asceticism,621bears a close resemblance to Yoga Tantra as understood in fourfold doxographicalsystems: an emphasis on inner meditation without external activities, employment of fourmudr›s, and so on.622 Inner Yoga, described as the vehicle of the tantra of method,623 isfurther subdivided into three types: the Mode of Generation (Tib: bskyed pa’i tshul), theMode of Completion (rdzogs pa’i tshul), and the Mode of Great Completion (rdzogs pachen po’i tshul). It is the first of these three—the mode of generation—that is identifiedin Tibetan traditions with Mah›yoga, while the second and third divisions representAnuyoga and Atiyoga, respectively.We find the term “Mah›yoga” used explicitly as a type of tantra inSÒryasiªhaprabha’s (Nyi ma’i seng ge ’od or Nyi ma’i ’od seng ge) commentary on theSecret Nucleus in a discussion of the five excellences (phun sum tshogs pa lnga) thatcharacterize a Buddha-voiced text as they apply to the various vehicles.624 In this contexthe treats Kriy›, Yoga, and Mah›yoga Tantra individually after first discussing the LesserVehicle and the Perfection Vehicle.625 He uses “Mah›yoga” as a category term again in a   620 Padmasambhava, Garland of Views, P4726, vol. 83, 84.1.1.621 rnal ’byor phyi pa thub pa rgyud kyi theg pa (Padmasambhava, Garland of Views, P4726, vol. 83,84.1.1).622 Butön characterizes Yoga Tantra thus: “Because the cultivation of internal yoga of wisdom and methodis central, it is Yoga Tantra” (nang thabs shes rab kyi rnal ’byor sgom pa gtso bor gyur pas rnal ’byorrgyud; Butön, Ship, 3a.6).623 rnal ’byor nang pa thabs kyi rgyud kyi theg pa (Padmasambhava, Garland of Views, P4726, vol. 83,84.1.1-84.1.2).624 SÒryasiªhaprabha, dPal gsang ba’i snying po de kho na nyid nges pa rgya cher bshad pa’i ’grel pa,P4719, vol. 83, 2.1.8-2.2.1, as per Martin, “Illusion Web,” p. 196.625 SÒryasiªhaprabha, dPal gsang ba’i snying po de kho na nyid nges pa rgya cher bshad pa’i ’grel pa,P4719, vol. 83, 2.1.6-2.2.1, as per Martin, “Illusion Web,” p. 196."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 229discussion of the meaning of “tath›gata” and “bhagav›n” in the following doxographicalclasses: Mah›y›na, Dual Tantra (gnyi ga rgyud), and Mah›yoga.626While SÒryasiªhaprabha clearly employs “Mah›yoga” as a type of tantra, little isknown about him. Tibetan traditions present him as an Indian tantric master of the lateeighth or early ninth century, but modern scholarship has raised questions not only abouthis dates (perhaps late ninth or even early tenth century) but also his nationality (Tibetan?Indian? Chinese?).627 Thus, his use of the term “mah›yoga” does not aid in establishingwith any certainty a firm date for such usage in India.While SÒryasiªhaprabha employs “Mah›yoga” as a category of tantra, unlike theGarland of Views he does not enumerate it as a subdivision of Yoga Tantra. However, aTun-huang text does reflect such a formulation. Likely dating to the late tenth century(according to Snellgrove ),628 this text divides Yoga Tantra into four types: Yoga,Mah›yoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.629The significance of the ninefold doxographical scheme presented in the Indian tantricmaster Padmasambhava’s Garland of Views is that, while Yoga Tantra is still the highestdoxographical category, it has hierarchical subdivisions, with the three “Inner Yogas” (ofwhich the first is identified by Tibetan traditions as Mah›yoga) placed in a position aboveYoga Tantra. Thus, it appears that already during the late eighth century in India therewas the conception of three higher classes of tantra that, while characterized by acontinuity and connectedness with Yoga Tantra, were at the same time understood torepresent a development beyond Yoga Tantra.

Moreover,in ⁄raddh›karavarman’s presentation we see the fourfold doxography that would come todominate later Indian tantric systems and Tibetan traditions stemming from the seconddissemination of Buddhism—although with Mah›yoga (“Great Yoga”) at the summitrather than the category Anuttarayoga (“Unsurpassed” or “Highest Yoga”), as is found inmost fourfold systems.The Mah›yoga Corpus and the Secret Nucleus TantraThe following summary is drawn mainly from presentations in the Nyingma School ofTibetan Buddhism, the traditions of which largely trace their origins to the firstdissemination of Buddhism in Tibet (c. eighth and ninth centuries). In some instances, Iam extrapolating from Nyingma Mah›yoga back to Indian Mah›yoga. Such an approachhas its obvious drawbacks. A systematic study of early Indian commentarial works onMah›yoga (preserved in Tibetan translation) by such authors as Buddhaguhya,Vil›savajra, SÒryasiªhaprabha, Vimalamitra, and others would likely clarify manyaspects of the state of affairs of Mah›yoga in India during the eighth and ninth centuries;this remains a desideratum.Mah›yoga texts are divided into the tantra class (Tib: rgyud sde, *tantra-varga) andthe s›dhana class (sgrub sde, *s›dhana-varga).634 While the latter consists of texts       Yog›nuttaratantr›rth›vat›rasaªgrahan›ma, P4536, vol. 81, 155.1.6).

This cycle of texts is said to havebeen subdivided from a larger work, the 100,000 stanza Magical Emanation Net (sGyu’phrul dra ba, M›y›j›la).635Although there are several enumerations of the eighteen texts, standard Nyingmapresentations employ a sixfold rubric under which the texts are classified: the well-knownBuddhist quintet of enlightened body (Tib: sku; Skt: k›ya), speech (gsung; v›c), mind(thugs; citta), qualities (yon tan; gu ̊a), and activity (’phrin las; karma), to which isadded a sixth, general (spyi; *s›m›nya), category. The first five divisions areexemplified, respectively, by the following tantra-texts: the Yoga of the Equality of theBuddhas (Buddhasam›yoga), the Secret Drop of the Moon (Candraguhyatilaka), theSecret Assembly (Guhyasam›ja), the ⁄rı Param›dya, and the Karmam›le Tantra.636The sixth division contains the Secret Nucleus (Guhyagarbha) Tantra—foremost of allthe eighteen Mah›yoga texts—along with several other tantras.

Each of the six divisions of the tantra class of Mah›yoga includesother tantras in addition to the exemplars I have just identified. The sixth, generalcategory is subdivided in various ways, with a division into eight component texts andfour exegetical tantras coming to be standard in Nyingma presentations.639 While most ofthe eight Magical Emanation Net tantras are closely related to the Secret Nucleus Tantra,differing mainly in length,640 the MañjuŸrı Magical Emanation Net is significant in itsown right. I have discussed this text, also known as the Litany of Names of MañjuŸrı, asa Yoga Tantra in chapter three (see p. 159 ff). I will return to this text below.The importance of the Secret Nucleus Tantra in Nyingma traditions cannot beoverstated: it is the central text of the Magical Emanation Net cycle of texts (whichtogether comprise the general category) and is the tantra that summarizes all the otherMah›yoga tantras. Moreover, in addition to being the primary Mah›yoga tantra-text, it isalso one of the central Nyingma tantras. Indeed, the Secret Nucleus is the tantra thatcame to be understood in Nyingma traditions as the very embodiment of a tantra per se,of what a tantra is.641   638 Butön himself is one of the central figures in this controversy as he excluded the Secret Nucleus fromhis influential redaction of the Kangyur.639 Dorje, Guhyagarbhatantra and Commentary, pp. 38-39.640 Dan Martin refers to them as “variations on a theme” (Martin, “Illusion Web,” p. 188).641 Gyurme Dorje states that the Secret Nucleus Tantra is the fundamental tantra of the Nyingma School(Dorje, Guhyagarbhatantra and Commentary, p. 58)."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 234Moreover, the exegetical literature on the Secret Nucleus Tantra came to be seen asthe defining hermeneutical exercise for talking about tantra, and in this regard the SecretNucleus Tantra plays the central role in Nyingma in much the same way that the SecretAssembly Tantra does in the Geluk School of Tibetan Buddhism, the Hevajra Tantradoes in the Sakya School, and the Cakrasa ̇vara Tantra does in the Kagyu School(Geluk, Sakya, and Kagyu being schools that stem from the second dissemination ofBuddhism in Tibet). While we cannot simply read the situation of the Secret NucleusTantra as it developed in Tibet back into India, it is informative, and together with othersources such as Amoghavajra’s summary of the eighteen-text VajraŸekhara Yoga corpus,provides enough evidence to draw tentative conclusions.Unlike the Compendium of Principles, there are no extant Sanskrit manuscripts of theSecret Nucleus Tantra. Moreover, whereas the Compendium of Principles was a centralfocus of the transmission of tantric Buddhism to China (and from there to Japan), theSecret Nucleus was never translated into Chinese. Consequently, while Amoghavajra’slengthy description of the Compendium of Principles and brief summaries of the otherseventeen texts of the VajraŸekhara tantric cycle represent a treasure-trove of informationabout early Indian tantric Buddhism, there are no such Chinese sources concerning theSecret Nucleus.While Amoghavajra mentions texts that are probably early versions of (or are at leastclosely related to) Mah›yoga tantras such as the Secret Assembly Tantra642 and the Yogaof the Equality of All Buddhas,643 he does not refer to anything identifiable as the SecretNucleus Tantra or any of the Magical Emanation Net texts related to it. In Tibet, theSecret Nucleus does not appear in the Denkar Palace Catalogue of translations made   642 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” pp. 193-194.643 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” pp. 179-180."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 235during the eighth and ninth centuries, but we must remember that this mainly cataloguesofficially-sanctioned translations and other translation activity was undoubtedly takingplace.The body of evidence concerning the early history of the Secret Nucleus Tantra is,thus, rather slim. We do know that many of the commentaries on the Secret NucleusTantra (preserved only in Tibetan translation) are attributed to Indian authors of the lateeighth century, such as Vil›savajra, Buddhaguhya, and Padmasambhava. Additionally,the characterization of the Secret Nucleus as the single text that summarizes all the otherMah›yoga texts, and its placement in the general category, likely indicates that it wasproduced after the seminal Mah›yoga tantras such as the Secret Assembly and the Yoga ofthe Equality of All Buddhas (which makes it possible for the Secret Nucleus tosummarize them). Setting aside the later Tibetan polemics refuting its Indianprovenance, the Secret Nucleus was most likely composed/ compiled in India during thelatter half of the eighth century (although it is possible that the first section, whichconcerns peaceful deities, existed during the middle decades of the eighth century).644Beyond this, however, there is little known about its provenance, and indeed the historyof Mah›yoga before its arrival in Tibet during the latter part of the eighth century remainslargely a mystery.Throughout this discussion it is important to remember that there are historicalstratifications within the Mah›yoga class of tantras. The earliest Mah›yoga texts are theSecret Assembly Tantra and the Yoga of the Equality of All Buddhas; as I mentionedabove, both are attested in Amoghavajra’s presentation of the VajraŸekhara cycle, whichplaces them (or early versions of them) in the first half of the eighth century.

However, the Secret Nucleus Tantra, likely a product of thelatter half of the eighth century, represents the full development of the distinctivecharacteristics of Mah›yoga (in addition to being the central tantra in NyingmaMah›yoga traditions), and it is for this reason that I will focus on it.There is one other important point to make about tantric categories: the production oftantras related to earlier phases did not cease when new developments arose. Therefore,it is possible that influences from later stages affected texts associated with earlierdevelopments. However, in the case of the Secret Nucleus Tantra, there is no evidencethat the later stratum of tantras such as the Hevajra and the Cakrasa ̇vara, which wouldcome to be classified as Yoginı Tantras, existed at the end of the eighth century.Therefore, it is reasonably certain that the Secret Nucleus is not a hybridization ofMah›yoga and later tantric forms.Ma ̊ ̃alas and IconographyAs I discussed above, the Compendium of Principles represents a significant milestonein Buddhist tantra in many respects. Among these is ma ̊ ̃ala structure, with the residentdeities grouped into five Buddha families rather than the three-family arrangementsfound in the Manifest Enlightenment of Vairocana and other earlier tantras. In Mah›yogatantras, the influence of the five-family structure persists. The ma ̊ ̃ala of peacefuldeities (called simply the Peaceful Ma ̊ ̃ala) described in the first chapter of the Secret   645 Toh. 2662, 20b.7, as cited in Davidson, Indian Esoteric Buddhism, p. 378, n. 137."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 237Nucleus presents five central Buddha figures,646 which accords with the central structureof the Vajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala of the Compendium of Principles. The Secret AssemblyTantra, a Mah›yoga text predating the Secret Nucleus, also exhibits a five-familyma ̊ ̃ala structure.647When we look at the number and identities of the deities who constitute the ma ̊ ̃alasof the Compendium of Principles and the Secret Nucleus, we find both similarities anddifferences. In the first, third, and fourth sections of the Compendium of Principles wefind ma ̊ ̃alas populated by peaceful deities, while those of the second section consist ofdeities in their wrathful reflexes. The Vajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala, which consists of thirty-sevendeities, serves as the model for all the other ma ̊ ̃alas of the tantra (with the exception ofthe condensed four-mudr› and single mudr› ma ̊ ̃alas that appear at the end of eachsection of the tantra). In the Secret Nucleus, the Peaceful Ma ̊ ̃ala consists of forty-twodeities, and the Wrathful Ma ̊ ̃ala consists of fifty-eight deities. Thus, compared to thema ̊ ̃alas of the Compendium of Principles, the Secret Nucleus exhibits a slightexpansion in the deity population of the Peaceful Ma ̊ ̃ala and a significant expansion ofthe Wrathful Ma ̊ ̃ala.There are, however, indications of a more direct relationship between the Vajradh›tuMa ̊ ̃ala of the Compendium of Principles and the Peaceful Ma ̊ ̃ala of the SecretNucleus. Nyingma traditions frequently refer to the Vajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala as the PeacefulVajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala.648 For example, the important fourteenth-century Nyingma figureLongchenpa’s Religious History includes an account of Buddhaguhya manifesting the   646 Martin, “Illusion Web,” p. 189.

However,although the Secret Nucleus Tantra does not use the standard nomenclature for the fivecentral Buddha figures, most commentarial traditions identify Ak ̋obhya as the Buddhaoccupying the central position.652Ak ̋obhya is the Buddha at the head of the vajra family, home of deities in theirwrathful reflexes. Here, in the shift from Vairocana to Ak ̋obhya, we see a Mah›yogacontinuation of the movement toward wrathful deities (and the practices involvingviolence associated with them) begun in texts of the Yoga Tantra class. This trend ismost prominent in the second section of the Compendium of Principles, which opens withVajrap› ̊i’s violent slaying of MaheŸvara and continues with the emanation and teachingof ma ̊ ̃alas populated by wrathful deities. The Secret Assembly Tantra provides an evenearlier Mah›yoga example of this development, as Ak ̋obhya occupies the centralposition in its main ma ̊ ̃ala.653In terms of the speaker of the tantra, we also find differences between theCompendium of Principles and the Secret Nucleus.

The Indian tantric exegete ⁄›kyamitra, in his Kosala Ornamentcommentary on the Compendium of Principles, characterizes Mah›vairocana in thisway:668Mah›vairocana is the nature of enlightened wisdom—liberation from theafflictive obstructions and the obstructions to omniscience—that which causesthe thorough display of the individually appearing natures of all things.In contrast, he states, “Vairocana is a Form Body.” Thus, Mah›vairocana is enlightenedwisdom itself, while Vairocana is one particular Buddha-form in which such wisdommanifests.669 In the Secret Nucleus Tantra and other Mah›yoga texts, Samantabhadra isdescribed in terms similar to Mah›vairocana. For instance, chapter two of the SecretNucleus begins thus:670Then the Supramundane Victor Samantabhadra—male agent, vajramind—penetrated [his] queen Samantabhadrı, the female object, phenomena,with his vajra, which is the mode of the nature of everything withoutexception.   668 rnam par snang mdzad chen po ni/ ye shes kyi rang bzhin te/ nyon mongs pa dang/ shes bya’i sgrib palas rnam par grol ba/ dngos po thams cad kyi rang bzhin so sor snang ba yang dag par ston par spyodpa’o/ (Butön, Extensive Explanation, 10b.6-10b.7).669 There is a similar conception of Mah›vairocana in the writings of KÒkai and the Shingon School ofJapanese Buddhism he founded, in which the Compendium of Principles plays a central role.670 de nas bcom ldan ’das byed pa po rdo rje yid kun tu bzang po thams cad ma lus pa’i rang bzhin gyitshul rdo rjes btsun mo bya ba mo chos kun tu bzang mo la ’jug par gyur to/ (gSang ba’i snying po,mTshams brag edition, vol. 20 (wa), 156.4-156.5).

Mah›vairocana represents enlightened wisdom, fromwhich the appearances of all things emerge. Samantabhadra also represents vajra mindand, together with Samantabhadrı, is the ground from which things emerge.671 We see inthe Secret Nucleus Tantra the added factor of the couple in union, and a bifurcation intothe paired aspects of agent and object, male and female, and mind and phenomena. Thus,this extends the notion of Mah›vairocana as the mind of enlightenment from whichappearances arise, adding the objective sphere to the subjective aspect. The ground fromwhich all things emerge now consists of enlightened mind penetrating phenomena.It is interesting to note in this context the presence of Mah›vairocana also in the SecretAssembly Tantra, which predates the Secret Nucleus. In the Secret Assembly the sixthBuddha is identified as Mah›vairocana.672 Early versions of this tantra date to the firsthalf of the eighth century, and the presence of Mah›vairocana as the sixth Buddhatherefore appears to be a transitional stage in the development from Mah›vairocana as anabstract entity (the enlightened mind of all Buddhas) found in the Compendium ofPrinciples to Samantabhadra as the sixth Buddha who, with Samantabhadrı, embodiesboth the subjective and objective aspects of enlightened wisdom penetratingphenomena.673   671 The first homage ⁄›kyamitra makes at the beginning of the Kosala Ornament is to Samantabhadra(byang chub sems dpa’ sems dpa’ chen po dpal kun tu bzang po la phyag ’tshal lo/, P3326, vol. 70,190.2.2-190.2.3).672 Snellgrove, “Categories of Buddhist Tantras,” p. 1366.673 The figure of Vairocana continues to appear in several tantras included in the Mah›yoga section of thetantric collection of the Nyingmas (rnying ma rgyud ’bum).

I will discuss theother two foundational and defining Buddhist tantric narratives in terms of how theyilluminate the relationship between the Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga corpora."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 248The MaheŸvara Subjugation Narrative, Violence, and SexThe MaheŸvara subjugation myth undergoes important changes in its Mah›yogaincarnations. This narrative appears in chapter fifteen of the Secret Nucleus Tantra, thefirst chapter of the wrathful section of the tantra. While the basic plotline is the same asthat in the Compendium of Principles (a Buddhist deity subdues MaheŸvara and hismalicious minions), the narrative is expanded in the Secret Nucleus, and several keyelements are added and/ or transformed.675The first difference is the frame-story with which the episode opens. In theCompendium of Principles the standard procedure for emanating ma ̊ ̃alas is interruptedwhen the Buddhas request Vajrap› ̊i to generate the deities of his Buddha family but herefuses on the grounds that there are pernicious beings like MaheŸvara who are nottrained by peaceful methods, and the subjugation of MaheŸvara ensues. In the SecretNucleus Tantra, however, it simply says that the central figure of the tantra (hereidentified not by name but rather as the lord of all Tath›gatas and the essence of allBuddhas) manifests as the ma ̊ ̃ala of wrathful deities, and then the text asks, “Why?” Itis in this context—the rationale for the Wrathful Ma ̊ ̃ala, and by extension for wrathfuldeities in general—that the MaheŸvara subjugation myth unfolds.This begins with a lengthy section in which the various types of suffering that arisefrom ignorance, such as the hot and cold hells and so forth, are detailed. The text thendiscusses various monstrous beings who have taken such forms due to their past actions.The narrative then states that the omniscient one—the protagonist Buddha of the   675 This summary is drawn from the Secret Nucleus Tantra, chapter fifteen (The mTshams brag Manuscriptof the rNying ma rgyud ’bum, vol. 20 [wa], 195.6-206.2;http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/tibet/pgviewer/pgview.php?id=Tb.417.b15 ff), with reference toGyurme Dorje’s English translation (Dorje, Guhyagarbhatantra and Commentary, pp. 1064-1074).Davidson also summarizes the Secret Nucleus Tantra’s version of the myth (Davidson, “Reflections onthe MaheŸvara Subjugation Myth,” p. 203)."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 249story—subdues these beings out of compassion. In order to do this, however, he mustemanate in wrathful forms; this then is presented as the rationale for the emanation of thema ̊ ̃ala of wrathful deities.After this lengthy prologue to the action, which we do not find in the Compendium ofPrinciples, the central Buddha figure enters into meditative stabilization and emanates awrathful form. He then rounds up MaheŸvara and all the other poisonous beings. Thecentral figure now transforms into Heruka (Tib: khrag ’thung: “blood-drinker”).676It is at this point that the trajectory of the narrative diverges sharply from that of theCompendium of Principles. While the basic story is the same—the evil MaheŸvara andhis retinue are subjugated and brought into the Buddhist fold—the emphasis shifts. In theCompendium of Principles, there is much verbal jousting between Vajrap› ̊i andMaheŸvara as a war of words is waged along with the physical (and supernatural) battlefor supremacy. To be sure, there is violence: Vajrap› ̊i eventually slays MaheŸvara,brings him back to life, and, as he is standing on MaheŸvara’s supine body, uses hismiraculous powers to make MaheŸvara beat all his heads with all his arms (and for Indiangods there are a lot of heads and arms) until finally Vairocana utters a mantra of love,through which the soles of Vajrap› ̊i’s feet bestow initiation on MaheŸvara and hebecomes enlightened.In the Secret Nucleus, the narrative takes a decided turn to the visceral. Herukasubjugates MaheŸvara and his cohorts by first ripping out their hearts and vital organs.He then disembowels and dismembers them, and proceeds to eat their flesh, drink their   676 Adelheid Hermann-Pfandt suggests that the deity Heruka first appears in the Yoga of the Equality of AllBuddhas, one of the earliest Mah›yoga tantras (“The Lhan kar ma as a Source for the History of TantricBuddhism,” p. 146). Ronald Davidson identifies an earlier reference in the 726 CE translation of theQuestions of Sub›hu to Heruka as a local, ghost-like demon (Davidson, Indian Esoteric Buddhism, p.213)."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 250blood, and wear their bones as ornaments. Heruka now manifests as wrathful deities ofthe five Buddha families and has his way with the wives of the ferocious beings he hasjust eviscerated and consumed (having apparently spared the females this fate). Aftermultiple wrathful deities have emanated from all these copulating deity couples, the maledeities—the many wrathful forms of the five families in which Heruka hasmanifested—expel as excrement from their bowels MaheŸvara and his male minions intoan ocean of filth. One of Heruka’s henchmen then drinks up the muck and revivifiesMaheŸvara and his retinue. Thoroughly defeated (no doubt through the sheer horror ofthe experience), they beg to be Heruka’s subjects, imploring him to take their wives,daughters, mothers, and sisters. The Supramundane Victor then bestows initiation onthem and they take their places in the ma ̊ ̃ala.The difference between the narratives is striking. In the Secret Nucleus version, theviolence is more pronounced and more graphic—and the details more visceral andgory—than they are in the Compendium of Principles. Evisceration, cannibalism,digestion, and excretion take center stage. There is almost no dialogue between theBuddhist subduers and their Hindu foes. While in the Compendium of Principles theverbal fight about who will submit to whose command is a central part of the encounter,this is completely absent from the narrative in the Secret Nucleus, in which thedisemboweling begins without a request to MaheŸvara and his cohorts to submit toBuddhist doctrine ever being made.This reflects the increasing importance given to violent rites in Mah›yoga tantras.Additionally, the violence is of a different type. In the Compendium of Principles theviolence Vajrap› ̊i visits on MaheŸvara and his retinue is in the service of Buddhistinstitutions. The episode is precipitated by the existence of MaheŸvara and othermalignant beings who must be defeated to make the world safe for Buddhism (and evento make it a Buddhist-dominated world). The Indian world at that time was fraught with"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 251violence and aggression, and this narrative represents a Buddhist tantric attempt tocounter violence with violence and thereby secure Buddhism’s place in that world. Thestruggle in the narrative is over who will accede to whose will, who will obey whosecommand—in short, whose world order it is. Thus, it represents the deployment ofviolence by Buddhist institutions (the foremost of which were large monasterycomplexes) to establish Buddhist doctrine, authority, and—perhaps most importantly forlarge bodies of monastics—Buddhist rules.In the Secret Nucleus Tantra these aspects of the narrative are lost. In their place wefind an emphasis on violence itself, and this violence has a decidedly transgressive cast.The dialogue between the Buddhist protagonist and MaheŸvara has vanished; gone too isthe focus on establishing and maintaining Buddhist law. In their place springs thesubversion of societal mores: cannibalism and a nauseating tale of digestion, excretion,and reconsumption of the excreted filth. Finally, this leads to the revivification ofMaheŸvara et al and, in what seems almost an afterthought, their conversion to Buddhismthrough tantric initiation. This reflects not only the increased importance of violence inMah›yoga but also a trend toward violence of an antinomian nature, no longer directedtoward serving the interests of Buddhist institutions.The other significant addition to the episode in the Secret Nucleus is the presence andimportance of sexual union between male and female deities. The first instance of thisoccurs toward the beginning of the narrative, when the central Buddha figure enters ameditative state and emanates a wrathful female deity, Wrathful Lordess (khro mo dbangphyug mo, *KrodheŸvarı). The jewel (penis) and lotus (vagina) then become engorgedand these two engage in a non-dual embrace (coitus).677 Out of this divine intercourse   677 khro mo dbang phyug chen mo mngon du phyung ste/ /hi hi zhes dgyes pa’i gzi mdangs kyis/ rin chenpadma rgyas par mdzad nas/ gnyis su med par ’khril ba’i dgyes pas thim (Secret Nucleus Tantra, in The"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 252comes a host of wrathful deities who are then involved in the subjugation of MaheŸvaraand his entourage.Here we see the importance of sexual yoga in performing the rites set forth in thetantra: deities are emanated out of the bliss that results from copulation. While sexualunion is mentioned in several places in the Compendium of Principles, it is not clear howit relates to the rituals in which it occurs. What is clear, however, is that it is neverpresented as part of the process of emanating deities from within a meditative state,which we find in the Secret Nucleus.Sexual congress is an integral part of another section of the MaheŸvara subjugationnarrative as it occurs in the Secret Nucleus Tantra. After Heruka has dismembered andconsumed MaheŸvara and the fierce male deities of his retinue, he engages in sex with allof these deities’ wives (after first manifesting as five Herukas). Again, these Herukasenter a meditative state before embracing the female deities, and from these unionsemerge various wrathful deities who then take their places in the ma ̊ ̃ala. We also findexplicit presentations of sexual yoga as an essential part of the meditative practicepresented in chapter eleven of the Secret Nucleus. Thus, compared to its occurrences inthe Compendium of Principles, sexual union plays a much more central and importantrole in the Secret Nucleus, in which it is integral to the meditative process of the tantra.While we see the roots of the practices involving violence and sex in the Compendiumof Principles, the MaheŸvara subjugation myth as it appears in the Secret Nucleus Tantrareflects several trends characteristic of Mah›yoga. There is a greater emphasis onviolence, which now tends toward the antinomian and is no longer in the service ofBuddhist institutions. Moreover, sexual practices have become a vital part of the       mTshams brag Manuscript of the rNying ma rgyud ’bum, vol. 20 [wa], 198.1-198.2).

These trends prefigure the later stratum oftantric development categorized under the rubric “Yoginı Tantra.” Here, in tantras suchas the Hevajra and Cakrasa ̇vara, blood-drinking deities who haunt cremation groundsand other locales beyond the pale of civilization are the central figures, and sexual yogahas been integrated into the very core of the practices. In the Yoginı Tantras theemphasis on violence and sex seen in the Secret Nucleus and other Mah›yoga tantrascomes to full flower while continuities with Yoga Tantras (such as the five Buddha-family configuration) are lost. Finally, the erotic comes to equal, or even surpass, theviolent. This is reflected in the central structure of the ma ̊ ̃ala: where in theCompendium of Principles there were five Buddhas and in the Secret Nucleus sixfamilies, the center now consists of a single deity pair in sexual union, representing thesixth family which itself symbolizes the essence of the five families.The Origin Myth: Eighteen Tantras, King IndrabhÒti, and the Dog KingThe myth explaining how the tantras arose in the human realm is, along with thenarratives of ⁄›kyamuni’s tantric enlightenment and MaheŸvara’s subjugation (both ofwhich appear for the first time in the Compendium of Principles), one of the central andenduring mythological narratives of Buddhist tantric literature. Its earliest knownoccurrence is in Jñ›namitra’s Commentary on the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom in150 Stanzas. As I discussed in chapter two (see p. 85, note 222), Jñ›namitra’s exegesisof this tantric Perfection of Wisdom text (categorized as a tantra and, more specifically,as a Yoga Tantra) likely dates to the middle of the eighth century, but certainly existed inIndia by the end of that century.

Therefore, thesetexts were kept in other realms such as the Heaven of the Four Great Kingsand the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. Later, after the Buddha’s parinirv› ̊a,the King of Zahor and his retinue developed great faith in the dharma andbecame suitable vessels of the vehicles of the Yoga of the Equality of AllBuddhas, the Secret Assembly, and so forth—of which there had previouslybeen no suitable human trainees. These eighteen great texts descended to theland of Zahor through the blessings of Vajrap› ̊i.IndrabhÒti, the king of Zahor, looked at the texts but could not understandthem.

One significant difference is that the texts heidentifies by name are the ⁄rı Param›dya, the Secret Assembly, and the SecretNucleus.682 Thus, he has eliminated the reference to the Yoga of the Equality of AllBuddhas, the first of the two tantras that Jñ›namitra enumerates when he refers to thecorpus of eighteen texts, and he has replaced it with the ⁄rı Param›dya, whichJñ›namitra mentions (although not as one of the eighteen texts). The second textSÒryasiªhaprabha identifies—the Secret Assembly—accords with Jñ›namitra’s account.SÒryasiªhaprabha also adds a third text: the Secret Nucleus. This is not surprising:SÒryasiªhaprabha is, after all, writing a commentary on this tantra. However, given theuncertainty over SÒryasiªhaprabha’s dates, it is possible that this indicates a later stratumof Mah›yoga development that arose after the production of the Secret Nucleus.The fact that the same narrative, with some variant details, serves as the origin mythfor both Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga traditions is significant.

While this represents a view of an early Indian eighteen-text tantric cycle, theTibetan presentations of the eighteen great Mah›yoga texts date only to the fourteenthcentury, although several of the individual texts appear among the Tun-huangmanuscripts dating to the late eighth or early ninth century and also are mentioned byNup Sangye Yeshe (gNubs Sangs rgyas ye shes),685 active during the ninth and earlytenth centuries.686In 1981 Kenneth Eastman opened the field of scholarship in English on these twoeighteen-text cycles and their implications for the early stages of the development of   683 Todaro, Annotated Translation, p. 3.684 Todaro, Annotated Translation, p. 11.685 Eastman, “The Eighteen Tantras,” pp. 17-18.686 Germano, “The Seven Descents,” p. 252."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 258Indian Buddhist tantra.687 Eastman drew on both Chinese and Tibetan primary sources aswell as on Japanese scholarship.

Many of these I have already discussedin presenting the texts of the Yoga Tantra corpus in chapter two, so I will but list themhere.690Amoghavajra’s second and third texts correspond, respectively, to the second and firstpart of the VajraŸekhara Tantra as preserved in Tibetan translation. The fourth textAmoghavajra summarizes corresponds to another extant explanatory Yoga Tantra, theConquest over the Three Worlds.

However, there are further inter-textual relationships thatobtain within each cycle. Drawing on the work of the Japanese scholar Tanaka Kimiaka,Giebel suggests that the order in which Amoghavajra discusses the eighteen texts of theVajraŸekhara cycle is not random.692 The Compendium of Principles is followed by textsthat correspond to its explanatory tantras—the two parts of the VajraŸekhara Tantra andthe Conquest over the Three Worlds—and perhaps also a fourth text, the Mundane andSupramundane Vajra Yoga.693Next we find several sub-cycles, each consisting of a root tantra followed by itsexplanatory tantras. Texts six through eight are the three cycles of the ⁄rı Param›dyasystem (which also includes the extant Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzasand Vajra Essence Ornament Tantra); the ninth text, the Yoga of the Equality of AllBuddhas, might represent the culmination of the development of this cycle.

It does, however, reveal the preeminenceof Samantabhadra, who would come to be the pivotal figure in Mah›yoga traditions (asdiscussed above in the context of the Secret Nucleus Tantra).Additionally, Amoghavajra describes the seventh of the eighteen VajraŸekhara texts,which corresponds to the second part of the extant Tibetan ⁄rı Param›dya, as explainingthat698[T]he practitioner is without time and without direction (or transcends timeand space), does not adhere to mundane prohibitory precepts, gives priority tothe bodhi mind, and regards the unconditioned precepts as fundamental.These are all aspects of Mah›yoga philosophy and practice as we find it in TibetanNyingma Mah›yoga traditions, and Amoghavajra’s description of them indicates theywere part of early ⁄rı Param›dya traditions.The frame-story of the ⁄rı Param›dya also suggests its identity as a Mah›yoga tantra.While this is not included in the tantra itself, Butön opens his summary of the ⁄rıParam›dya with it. This story involves great bliss (bDe ba chen po, mah›-sukha) andgreat desire. These are invoked throughout the ⁄rı Param›dya (“great bliss” occurs inthe text title at the end of most of the chapters of the extant Tibetan text), and it is perhapsthis emphasis that secured its place firmly within the Mah›yoga system.

While the fact that thefive-tantra cycle Butön mentions includes both the VajraŸekhara Tantra and the Yoga ofthe Collection of All Procedures would seem to militate against the latter being the firstpart of the former, this is not necessarily the case.

Thechapter numbering of the second supplement, which begins with chapter eighteen andconcludes with chapter twenty three, indicates that it is a continuation of another text.Additionally, between chapters twenty two and twenty three there is a closing section, anunusual feature since closing sections rarely fall anywhere except at the end of a text,following its final chapter.

It is also possible that the third text, identified as a tantra in itstitle and consisting of ten chapters, represents the first ten chapters of the larger text oftwenty-two chapters. In the Derge edition of the Collected Tantras of the Nyingmas andin the Kangyur the ten-chapter text is identified in its title as the supplement, whichwould seem to rule it out as the tantra itself. However, in the Tsamdrak and Tingyeeditions of the Collected Tantras of the Nyingmas the ten-chapter text is titled “tantra”and not “supplement,” and the colophon indicated that it was a summary of the twenty-two chapter tantra.Additionally, according to the Catalogue of the Nyingma Edition of the Kangyur,Butön’s fourteenth-century Kangyur catalogue describes the three parts of the Yoga of theEquality of All Buddhas as a text having ten chapters, a seven-chapter supplement alreadymissing at that time, and also a text of five chapters, all of which totaled 18,000stanzas.711 This evidence points to a Yoga of the Equality of All Buddhas that had a ten-chapter tantra, a seven-chapter supplement, and a second supplement in five chapters.The chapter numbering of the extant texts supports such a claim: the tantra ends withchapter ten and the second supplement begins with chapter eighteen, and thus there is amissing supplement of seven chapters (as both Butön and the colophon in the Tsamdrak   711 Catalogue of the Nyingma Edition, vol. 2, p. 9.

Furthermore, we find thephrase “Collection of All Procedures” in the titles of the first three chapters of theVajraŸekhara Tantra, and I will now explore the relationship between the VajraŸekharaTantra and the second supplement to the Yoga of the Equality of All Buddhas (that is, theCollection of All Procedures).While this is a potentially rich field of inquiry and deserves in-depth textual analysesand comparison, I will limit my discussion to some preliminary remarks based on thebeginning of the two texts. Both texts open in verse of the same meter, as all the   712 I am translating the Sanskrit word kalpa (and the corresponding Tibetan rtog pa) as “procedure” in thesense of a prescribed ritual procedure. This word is also frequently used in tantras as the designation forchapters, presumably since each chapter contains a discrete ritual procedure. In some instances thetranslation “chapter” might be more meaningful.713 Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 167. Giebel relates that Sakai’s scholarship (in Japanese)puts the number of questions asked of Vajrasattva in the first half of the Tibetan VajraŸekhara Tantra atabout 300, of which 115 are followed immediately by an answer (Giebel, “Chin-kang-ting ching yü-ch’ieh,” p. 168, n. 166)."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga 269Buddhas query Vajrasattva/ Vajradhara with a series of questions.714 In both texts, theinterlocutors (all the Buddhas) are identified as “protectors”: the VajraŸekhara reads “allthe great protector Buddhas”715 and the Collection of All Procedures reads “Sugatasupreme protectors.”716Both texts then continue with the Buddhas reciting a litany of epithets praisingVajrasattva/ Vajradhara before they request that he answer their questions.

Thus, the first half ofthe Yoga Tantra the VajraŸekhara Tantra and the second supplement of the Mah›yogaTantra the Yoga of the Equality of All Buddhas appear to be related, along with the thirdtext in Amoghavajra’s VajraŸekhara cycle, the Yoga of the Collection of All Procedures.It is possible that this early Yoga of the Collection of All Procedures developed in twostrands, one of which became the first part of the VajraŸekhara Tantra while the otherbecame the second supplement of the Yoga of the Equality of All Buddhas.There is another possible relationship that obtains between these two texts, adiscussion of which I will preface with a brief description of the beginning of theVajraŸekhara Tantra. After the title and homage (the first of which is to Samantabhadra,which perhaps belies the text’s connection with Mah›yoga), the body of theVajraŸekhara begins abruptly. Whereas other Yoga Tantras such as the Compendium ofPrinciples begin with the standard opening line for a Buddha-voiced text “Thus have Iheard at one time,” this does not appear in the VajraŸekhara.

It is possible that the firsthalf of the VajraŸekhara (consisting of three chapters)—given its similarity (in both titleand content) to the second supplement of the Yoga of the Equality of AllBuddhas—represents or is related to the missing supplement to the Yoga of the Equalityof All Buddhas, which is described as having seven chapters.

This could indicate that the first part of the VajraŸekhara Tantra wasoriginally the supplement to another tantra—perhaps to the first text of the Yoga of theEquality of All Buddhas.In the VajraŸekhara Tantra and the Collection of All Procedures we see a definiteconnection between Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga systems. Further research into thecontent of these texts—the individual questions asked, as well as the answers given, ineach tantra—as well as into their histories and lineages is necessary to flesh out thedetails of this relationship.

The Secret Assembly is one of the earliest examples of the stratum of tantricdevelopment that grew out of the Compendium of Principles. It is a member both ofAmoghavajra’s eighteen-text cycle and of the Mah›yoga eighteen-text cycle, and it is oneof the two texts Jñ›namitra identified by name as exemplars of the eighteen-text cycle inhis origin narrative.The Secret Assembly Tantra exhibits many features that indicate the influence of theCompendium of Principles, such as the presence of the five manifest enlightenments anda five Buddha family structure at the center of its main ma ̊ ̃ala. Additionally,Amoghavajra’s summary of the Secret Assembly’s teachings includes the four kinds ofma ̊ ̃alas and four kinds of mudr›s,722 just as are found in the Compendium ofPrinciples.723 He also explains that the text was expounded in the vagina,724 which is thelocation given at the beginning of the extant Sanskrit and Tibetan texts. Thus, we find inthe Secret Assembly Tantra an indication of a trend toward sexual intercourse as animportant feature of the text’s meditation and ritual system—a distinctive feature ofMah›yoga.However, the roots of the Secret Assembly grow from the Compendium of Principles,perhaps more strongly and evidently than those of any other tantra of this stratum, asevidenced by the elements the Secret Assembly shares with the Compendium ofPrinciples.

This close associationof the two tantras persists to the present in the Gelukpa School of Tibetan Buddhism.This school holds closely to a fourfold tantric doxography in which the Secret Assembly,one of the two central tantras of this school, is included in the Highest Yoga Tantracategory and the Compendium of Principles is classified as a Yoga Tantra. However, theCompendium of Principles is considered to be the root tantra of the Secret Assembly.Although contemporary Gelukpa scholars explain that the Compendium of Principles isthe root tantra of the Secret Assembly in terms of being taught first chronologically,725this is also true for many other tantras; however, the point is not made that theCompendium of Principles is also the root tantra of these texts. This belies the closehistorical connection between the Compendium of Principles and the Secret AssemblyTantra.Another tantra that should be mentioned here is the Litany of Names of MañjuŸrı(MañjuŸrın›masaºgıti). While it is a member of the Mah›yoga cycle of eighteen texts(where it is known as the MañjuŸrı Magical Emanation Net), it is not mentioned byAmoghavajra in his discussion of the VajraŸekhara cycle.

Additionally, the extant Sanskrit text (as well as the version ofthe Tibetan translation in the Kangyur) identifies itself as the “stages of manifestenlightenment of the Magical Emanation Net” (v.7) and later states that it was “extractedfrom the meditative stabilization (sam›dhi) chapter of the great Magical Emanation Net,a Mah›yoga Tantra” (v. 13 and colophon).729 Furthermore, there is a structural similaritybetween the Litany of Names of MañjuŸrı and the meditative stabilization chapters of theSecret Assembly and another tantra in the Magical Emanation Net cycle, the source of allof which appears to be the process of the five manifest enlightenments found at thebeginning of the Compendium of Principles.730The Litany of Names of MañjuŸrı is a particularly interesting tantra, as it wasinterpreted within several different tantric classifications, ranging from Yoga Tantra toMah›yoga to Highest Yoga Tantra (and within that, several different cycles).

Moreover, the Nyingma School also considers Buddhaguhya to be animportant exegete and transmitter of Mah›yoga traditions. Several commentaries ontexts of the Magical Emanation Net cycle are attributed to him, including the Stages ofVajra-Activity of the Magical Emanation Net,733 the Sequence of the Path,734 and acommentary on the Vajrasattva Magical Emanation Net Tantra.735There is, however, some doubt as to whether Buddhaguhya the Mah›yoga exegete isthe same person as Buddhaguhya the Action/ Performance/ Yoga Tantra exegete. Thetimeframe for Buddhaguhya’s activities in Tibetan Mah›yoga accounts fits that of theBuddhaguhya in contact with central Tibet during the eighth century, who is clearly theauthor of the Entry into the Meaning of the Tantra and other works.

In particular, there is one text that perhapsrepresents a bridge between the two bodies of tantric commentaries attributed toBuddhaguhya. This text is the Dharma Ma ̊ ̃ala SÒtra, which contains references to theunion of vajra (penis) and lotus (vagina) in “secret” ma ̊ ̃alas, as well as to male-femaledeity pairs (yab-yum).737 This text, which Butön discusses as a Yoga Tantra text andappears to indicate is related to the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations,738 is ofparticular interest because it is one of the earliest exegetical works that explicitly refers topractices involving sexual union. As such, the Dharma Ma ̊ ̃ala SÒtra and itsrelationship to Buddhaguhya’s other commentaries might hold important data concerningthe development of such practices from their brief mentions in the Compendium ofPrinciples to their integration into meditation and ritual as we find in the Secret NucleusTantra.PadmasambhavaWhile Buddhaguhya is an important figure in Nyingma Mah›yoga, his putativestudent Padmasambhava has come to be the central figure in the dissemination ofBuddhism from India to Tibet for the Nyingma School.

While the provenance of this text iscomplex, the earliest extant version of the Testament of Wa is a revised version of a textthat dates to around the eleventh century.740 This account portrays Padmasambhava’ssojourn in Tibet as a brief one, focused on subduing—through violent practices—localdeities antagonistic to the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet and performing somemiracles involving water for irrigation purposes.741As David Germano points out, in more specifically religious terms Padmasambhava’sactivities revolved around Mah›yoga, and in particular the Secret Nucleus Tantra andviolent, exorcistic rites based on the cult of the wrathful Vajra-Dagger deity (rdo rje phurpa, vajrakılaya).742 Germano concludes his brief historical sketch of Padmasambhava bysaying, “Unlike Buddhaguhya, he seems to have been focused on the new movement[that is, Mah›yoga], and not so interested in earlier tantric cycles.”743 While I do notdispute this assertion, I will examine the influences of Yoga Tantra texts that we find in       of such treasure-texts are the various texts of the “Liberation through Hearing in the Intermediate State”cycles (the so-called Tibetan Book of the Dead), the first of which was discovered by Karma gLing pain the fourteenth/fifteenth century.

Although it is difficult to strip away lateraccretions to his legend, his most basic biography is this: the exorcist Padmasambhavawas invited to Tibet to subdue indigenous Tibetan demons impeding the establishment ofBuddhism there (for a discussion of Padmasambhava’s activities in Tibet, see p. 301 ff).Through wrathful practices, Padmasambhava subdued these forces and bound them intothe service of the dharma.

Nyingma traditions hold that, in addition to his exorcisticactivities in Tibet, Padmasambhava was a major figure in transmitting Mah›yoga systemsto Tibetans, and in particular he is closely associated with the Secret Nucleus Tantra.This tantra includes much philosophical development beyond that found in theCompendium of Principles. One particular philosophical focus in the Secret Nucleus isthe nature of the mind. We find a brief presentation of the nature of the mind as naturallyluminous at the beginning of the enlightenment narrative in the Compendium ofPrinciples, which continues with the process of realizing this nature and developing thisrealization in stages. It seems more than coincidence that Padmasambhava quotes astanza referring to this very stage—the first stage in the process of the five manifestenlightenments—when such philosophical speculation is further developed in the SecretNucleus Tantra with which he is associated.I will briefly discuss one other text quoted in the Garland of Views, the Great PledgeSÒtra (Dam tshig chen po’i mdo, *Mah›-Samaya SÒtra).

In fact, four of Amoghavajra’s eighteen texts have “Pledge” or“Great Pledge” in their titles. Texts ten, twelve, and fourteen are titled Great PledgeYoga (*Mah›-samaya-yoga),764 Supreme Pledge Yoga (*Samaya-parama-yoga),765 andPrinciple of the Tath›gata Pledge Yoga (*Tath›gata-samaya-tattva-yoga),766respectively; no extant texts that correspond to these have been identified.The thirteenth text in the VajraŸekhara Yoga corpus is the Principle of the GreatPledge Yoga (*Mah›-samaya-tattva-yoga),767 a title identical to the one mentioned byfinandagarbha (with the exception of “yoga,” with which the title of all but the first ofAmoghavajra’s eighteen texts ends).

By the middle or endof the eighth century the term still carried its superlative connotation, but it wasbeginning to be used in a narrower sense to reflect the continued development ofdoctrines and practices found in the Compendium of Principles and texts later classifiedas Yoga Tantras. Thus, “mah›yoga” came to have the meaning “Super Yoga [Tantra]”and referred initially to a newly emerging sub-canon of Yoga Tantra. However, the senseof Mah›yoga as a distinct stratum of tantra did not arise immediately: the mid-eighthcentury eighteen-text cycles discussed by Jñ›namitra and Amoghavajra include tantrasthat would later be classified as Yoga Tantra and well as tantras that would later beclassified as Mah›yoga, and neither Indian exegete makes any doxogrpahical distinctionsamong the canon of texts.The corpus of tantras that would come to be classified as Mah›yoga—and particularlyits earliest members, such as the Secret Assembly Tantra—clearly shows its affinity withthe Compendium of Principles and texts classified as Yoga Tantra in terms of ma ̊ ̃alastructure, types of mudr›s, enlightenment narrative, and so forth. The philosophicalinnovation of Mah›vairocana as an abstract entity—the mind of enlightenment or theessence of the five Buddhas—found in the Compendium of Principles and texts closelyassociated with it undergoes further development in the Secret Nucleus Tantra and textsclassified under the rubric of Mah›yoga. In these texts Mah›vairocana is replaced by   771 dPal dam tshig chen po’i rgyud kyi rgyal po zhes bya ba, ⁄rı Mah›samaya-tantrar›ja-n›ma, P35 (Toh.390).

These become more emphasized and central in theMah›yoga tantras, as we see with the Secret Nucleus and particularly as encapsulated inits version of the MaheŸvara subjugation myth.While the narrative in the Compendium of Principles involves violence, it is violencein the service of the needs of Buddhist institutions, and the establishment of Buddhist lawand order is paramount. In the Secret Nucleus narrative, however, the violence is morepronounced and visceral (dismemberment, disemboweling, and so forth), and has a morecentral role. We find echoes of this in the person of Padmasambhava and his Garland ofViews commentary on the thirteenth chapter of the Secret Nucleus Tantra. The texts thiseighth-century Indian tantric master cites and his activities subjugating the demons ofTibet demonstrate not only the close relationship between texts classified under therubrics of Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga but also the distinctive emphasis of the latter onwrathful deities and violent practices. Additionally, the violence portrayed in the SecretNucleus subjugation narrative also demonstrates an antinomian character, withcannibalism, the consumption of excrement, and the like, and the establishment ofBuddhist rule—central to the original version of the myth as it appears in theCompendium of Principles and related texts—fades to the background (if not altogether).Moreover, practices involving sex are now an integral part of the meditative process inthe Secret Nucleus Tantra’s subjugation narrative.

In tantras such as the Hevajra andCakrasa ̇vara, classified as Yoginı Tantras, violence and sex take center stage.Practices involving the subtle body are introduced, the erotic becomes a central focus,and the tantras take on a decidedly antinomian bent, beyond that found in Mah›yoga."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in TibetIntroductionThe Compendium of Principles and the tantric traditions it directly spawned formed inTibet the substance of mainstream tantric traditions—under the rubric of the “YogaTantra” tradition—for the period beginning with the first dissemination of Buddhism inthe eighth century and running through the early phases of the second dissemination ofBuddhism during the late tenth and eleventh centuries. Even after later Indian traditionsdisplaced them from the central position of importance in Tibet, these Yoga Tantrasystems continued to be transmitted as a coherent tantric tradition. I will examine thetranslation and transmission in Tibet of the Compendium of Principles and texts classifiedas Yoga Tantra during these two periods against the backdrop of broader issues such asofficially-sanctioned translation activity, the royal Vairocana cult, the period followingthe collapse of the Tibetan empire, the beginning of the second dissemination and thepeak of Yoga Tantra’s influence, Yoga Tantra during the twelfth through sixteenthcenturies, and the persistent influence of Yoga Tantra to the present.Yoga Tantra during the First Dissemination of BuddhismAs I detailed in chapters one and two, there are only four Yoga Tantras that we can saywith any certainty were translated during the early period of the propagation of Buddhismin Tibet: the Compendium of Principles, the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations, theMode of the Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzas, and the Litany of Names of MañjuŸrı.Butön cites imperial-period translations of the Compendium of Principles but does not"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in Tibet 293mention the translators’ names.772 Although the Compendium of Principles does notappear in the Denkar Palace Catalogue of officially authorized translations of the imperialperiod, there is textual evidence that supports Butön’s assertion. The extant translation inthe Peking edition of the Kangyur states that, although the tantra has no translationcolophon, it is known as a translation by [the Indian] Pa ̊ ̃ita ⁄raddh›karavarman and theTibetan translator Rinchen Zangpo (Rin chen bzang po, 958-1055 CE, active at thebeginning of the later period of translation activity), and that it was revised in accordancewith three different translations of the tantra from the earlier period of translation.773In addition, there is the case of Buddhaguhya’s Entry into the Meaning of the Tantra(Tantr›rth›vat›ra), written during the second half of the eighth century while this Indianmaster was in retreat in the western Himalayas (near Mt.

It therefore seems quite likelythat the Compendium of Principles—the text on which the Entry into the Meaning of theTantra expounds—was not only available to the Tibetans (Buddhaguhya himself mightwell have been in possession of a Sanskrit manuscript while in retreat in the Himalayas)but also that there was a Tibetan translation at that time, since sending the Tibetan king a   772 Butön, Ship, 70a.5.773 rgyud ’di la ’gyur byang mi snang na’ang/ pa ̊ ̃› [sic] ta shraddhA lA [sic] ra warmma dang/ bod kyilotstsha ba rin chen bzang pos bsgyur bar grags shing rgya dpe rnying ’gyur mi ’dra ba gsum bstun tezhus dag bsgrubs so/ (Compendium of Principles, P112, vol. 4, 283.2.1-283.2.2).774 Butön, Ship, 68a.7.775 Butön, Ship, 68b.2-68b.3."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in Tibet 294text of instructions for the Compendium of Principles and its central practice without thetantra itself being available makes little sense.Butön also discusses a translation of the Purification of All Bad TransmigrationsTantra made during the first dissemination by the Indian master ⁄›ntigarbha and theTibetan translator Peltsek Rak ̋ita (dpal brtsegs rak ̋i ta),776 which Ma Rinchenchok777revised with standardized terminology by the early part of the ninth century. Thisassertion is indisputable: the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations is one of only ahandful of tantras listed in the Denkar Palace Catalogue, and its commentary byBuddhaguhya also appears there. The original translation can be located more preciselyto the latter part of the eighth century, since ⁄›ntigarbha performed the consecration ofSamye, Tibet’s first monastery, around 779 CE and thus must have been in Tibet by thatdate, and also because Buddhaguhya was in contact with the Tibetan court at about thesame time.Like the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations, the Mode of the Perfection ofWisdom in 150 Stanzas and Jñ›namitra’s commentary on it both appear in the DenkarPalace Catalogue, so we can date them to the early period of translation. Butön indicatesthat the tantra was first translated into Tibetan when ⁄›ntigarbha was active in Tibet,778which places it toward the end of the eighth century.The fourth text related to the Yoga Tantra corpus translated during the firstdissemination of Buddhism is the Litany of Names of MañjuŸrı.

However, as van der Kuijp details, Tibetan scholars as early as the twelfth centuryquestioned the identity of the translators (van der Kuijp, “SarvadurgatipariŸodhanatantra in Tibet,” pp.109-110).777 Butön, Ship, 70a.5-70a.6.778 Butön, Ship, 70b.4-70b.5."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in Tibet 295Denkar Palace Catalogue, and early translations among the Tun-huang manuscriptsconfirm the tantra’s translation during the first dissemination. Additionally, there aretranslations preserved in the Collected Tantras of the Nyingma that accord with the Tun-huang manuscripts and thereby provide corroboration for the early date of translation.779The Tibetan Attitude toward TantraAs the four Yoga Tantras just discussed illustrate, the translation and transmission inTibet of the latest in Indian Buddhist tantric technologies proceeded during the latter partof the eighth century and the beginning of the ninth century. The inclusion of three of thefour texts in the Denkar Palace Catalogue of officially sanctioned translationsdemonstrates the interest of the Tibetan court in such forms of Buddhism.However, the situation is not so cut-and-dried. The Compendium of Principles, forinstance, is not listed in the Denkar Palace Catalogue even though it almost certainly hadbeen translated when the catalogue was compiled. Additionally, if even a fraction of thetranslations in the Collected Tantras of the Nyingmas that are ascribed to the firstdissemination of Buddhism belong to that period, there was a huge amount of translationactivity taking place outside of officially supported or sanctioned situations, and much ofthis was concerned with tantric literature. The Tibetan ruling elite appears to have beenambivalent toward at least certain forms of tantric Buddhism and therefore did notsanction many translations of tantras or their commentarial literature.Accounts of the translation of the Compendium of Principles and the Purification ofAll Bad Transmigrations illuminate central aspects of this imperial circumspectionconcerning tantra.

Theothers [that is, the other parts of the Compendium of Principles] werethoroughly and completely translated.782Here we have an example—in the context of Yoga Tantra during the early period ofTibet’s conversion to Buddhism—of a frequently commented upon aversion towardscertain types of tantric practices.783 As scholars such as Matthew Kapstein have pointedout, the wide dissemination of such practices would have been antithetical to the interestsof the burgeoning Tibetan empire, which was at that time the dominant power in central   780 de’i tshe rtsa ba’i rgyud de nyid bsdus pa/ mngon spyod kyi las tshogs ston pa rnams ma bsgyur barskad sor bzhag tu bzhag/ gzhan rnams yongs su rdzogs par bsgyur ro/ (Butön, Ship, 70a.5).781 This term is difficult to translate. It connotes violence or even death wrought through ritual means, andtherefore perhaps “black magic” renders it more accurately (albeit more freely).782 There is a brief text titled Violent [or Black Magic] Activities (Tib: mNgon spyod kyi las; Skt:*Abhic›ra-karma) in the Derge, Cone, and Lhasa editions of the Kangyur. The text consists of a scantfive lines of verse and has no title line or introduction. The body of the text appears to be instructionsfor performing violent/black magic activities.

It is possible that this brief text Violent Activities represents the parts of theCompendium of Principles involving black magic that Butön says were not translated during the eighthcentury, although, as I will discuss below, it is more likely that it represents a similar section from thePurification of All Bad Transmigrations.783 For a detailed discussion of this issue, see Snellgrove, Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, vol.

While they might well have desired the deployment of such practices fortheir own purposes, they certainly wanted to control and limit access to such ritualtechnologies. What is particularly remarkable is that this censureship was applied notonly to the more antinomian tantric traditions that came to be known as Mah›yoga, butalso to the classic tantra of institutional Buddhism such as the Compendium of Principles(as well as the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations).There is further evidence regarding the bowdlerization of Yoga Tantra translationsduring the early period.

While there is no title line or homage at the beginning of thetext, the title “Violent Activities” (mNgon spyod kyi las) is given at the end of the text.Furthermore, van der Kuijp reports that in the Lithang edition of the Kangyur part of thepassage has been inserted into the colophon between the names of the translators and thatof the reviser.788Therefore, it seems likely that a passage concerning ritual activities directed towardviolent ends was left out of the original translation of the Purification of All BadTransmigrations.

Thisindicates first of all that censorship of tantric texts and practices was an issue in Tibetduring the eighth and early ninth centuries, and in particular that it was applied to YogaTantras as well as to the more radical and recently developed Mah›yoga tantras such asthe Secret Nucleus.Thus, while in later periods the Compendium of Principles was seen as a conservativetext in comparison with the standards of violence and sex in tantras such as the SecretNucleus, it appears that within its original historical context in Tibet Yoga Tantra itselfwas considered sufficiently dangerous and objectionable (at least in parts) to elicitgovernment concerns and censure (I will revisit the issue of censorship in discussingYoga Tantra’s role during the early part of the second dissemination of Buddhism).Butön’s discussion of imperial-period censorship also indicates that this was still an issuein Butön’s milieu of fourteenth-century Tibet; it would continue to be so at least foranother hundred years, as the Sakya scholar Gorampa Sönam Senge (Go rams pa bSod   789 Butön, Ship, 70b.3-70b.4."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in Tibet 300nams seng ge, 1425-1469) also discusses it in his commentary on the Purification of AllBad Transmigrations.790The ambivalence of the Tibetan court toward Buddhism, and especially toward tantra,can be seen in the Testament of Wa, the earliest extant chronicle of the first disseminationof Buddhism. Throughout the narrative there are references to ministers opposed toBuddhism, so we must bear in mind the important socio-political aspects of theintroduction of Buddhism. In addition, the Tibetan world (then as now) was a worldpopulated by unseen agents. Therefore, ritual efficacy in controlling these forces was ofparamount importance, as was the corresponding threat of black magic.We see the concern with black magic in the accounts concerning ⁄›ntarak ̋ita andPadmasambhava, the two most important Indian Buddhist masters active in Tibet duringthe early part of the first dissemination. Although he had an interest in Buddhism, forsome time the Tibetan ruler Trisong Detsen hesitated in extending an invitation to themonastic preceptor ⁄›ntarak ̋ita for fear of opposition among his ministers. Then, evenafter ⁄›ntarak ̋ita arrived in Lhasa, the king was suspicious of black magic and evilspirits and so dispatched three ministers, who interrogated the monk for two monthsbefore the king himself would meet with the Indian master.791 ⁄›ntarak ̋ita thenexpounded Buddhist doctrine to the king and others, but several natural disastersoccurred: a royal palace flooded, a castle was struck by lightning and burned down,famine and epidemics affecting people and animals descended on Tibet, and so forth.Buddhism was blamed and, under mounting pressure from his ministers (and in alllikelihood his own suspicions), Trisong Detsen sent ⁄›ntarak ̋ita back to Nepal whencehe came.792   790 van der Kuijp, “SarvadurgatipariŸodhanatantra in Tibet,” p. 110.791 Wangdu and Diemberger, dBa’ bzhed, pp. 40-45.792 Wangdu and Diemberger, dBa’ bzhed, pp. 46-47."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in Tibet 301Some time later, the king decided to issue a second invitation to ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, whosuggested that Padmasambhava also be invited. ⁄›ntarak ̋ita and Padmasambhava, alongwith a Nepalese architect-geomancer, traveled to central Tibet. Along the wayPadmasambhava performed various demon subjugations and water-related feats such ascalming boiling springs through ritual. When they reached central Tibet and met TrisongDetsen, ⁄›ntarak ̋ita introduced Padmasambhava as a master of mantra capable ofsubduing all the local deities obstructing the establishment of Buddhism and pacifyingthe land of Tibet.793Padmasambhava performed a mirror-divination to identify the obstructing deities, andthen performed a ritual to subdue them and bind them by oath into the service ofBuddhism. After completing the ritual he informed the court that it must be performedtwice more to complete the subjugation. The narrative then continues withPadmasambhava suggesting several water-technology and irrigation projects such astransforming sandy regions into meadows by causing springs to appear, and he performsone such water-related miracle. Trisong Detsen became suspicious and suspended furtherperformance of these rituals, and the ruler requested Padmasambhava to leave Tibet.Padmasambhava angrily decried the king’s narrow-mindedness, jealousy, and fear that hewould usurp Trisong Detsen’s political power, and then set out on his journey back toIndia. In the meantime, a meeting of the king and his counselors was convened, at whichthey decided that Padmasambhava must be killed to prevent him from bringing harm toTibet. To accomplish this objective, the court dispatched a gang of assassins.

Bearing in mind the discussion from chapter four concerning Padmasambhava’sliterary involvement in wrathful practices and the account in the Testament of Wa, it isclear that he specialized in violent practices of subjugation and the like. Thus,Padmasambhava is invited to Tibet to subdue local deities and other forces opposingBuddhism, but his activities meet with such suspicion that he too is sent packing—and, asa preemptive strike against the possibility that he would unleash his black magic againstTibet, an attempt is made on his life.795It is important to remember that the king involved here is Trisong Detsen, whoadopted Buddhism as the religion of the court and was the first Tibetan ruler to importBuddhism on a large scale. We are therefore dealing with a pro-Buddhist king, whichmakes these events all the more striking and illuminative of the Tibetan social landscapeduring the last half of the eighth and first half of the ninth century. Given the accounts ofgovernment proscription of passages involving violent or black-magic type rituals in thetranslation of the Compendium of Principles and the Purification of All BadTransmigrations—as well as the Testament of Wa’s portrayal of the socio-politicalclimate of eighth-century Tibet—it is clear that the Tibetan ruling aristocracy was at onceboth interested in and highly suspicious of certain aspects of tantric Buddhism.   795 Wangdu and Diemberger remark that Padmasambhava engages in feats related to water and irrigationand also suggests the employment of further irrigation technologies; since the control of water resourceswas of utmost political importance, it is perhaps not surprising that the Tibetan government feltthreatened by Padmasambhava’s activities (Wangdu and Diemberger, dBa’ bzhed, p. 14)."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in Tibet 303The Royal Vairocana CultWhile I have detailed several factors that curbed the enthusiasm of the ruling elite indynastic Tibet for tantric Buddhism, there were also compelling reasons for suchenthusiasm. Perhaps the central manifestation of the interest of the king and thearistocracy in tantra was the development of a royal Vairocana cult, of which there is asubstantial body of architectural and art-historical evidence.One of the strongest pieces of evidence in this regard is Samye, Tibet’s firstmonastery, constructed and consecrated (c. 779) during the reign of Trisong Detsen—thesame king who both invited and dismissed Padmasambhava. Samye occupies animportant place in the Tibetan psyche, as its consecration is taken as the defining event inthe conversion of Tibet to Buddhism.796Samye is a sprawling complex that consists of many buildings arranged as a ma ̊ ̃ala,at the center of which is the three-storey main temple. The iconography of this centraltemple—the focal point of the Samye ma ̊ ̃ala—reflects the importance of Vairocana.According to various versions of the Testament of Wa, the third storey housed a ma ̊ ̃alaof Sarvavid Vairocana, the central ma ̊ ̃ala of the Purification of All BadTransmigrations. Moreover, Vairocana was the central deity on the second floor, whileon the ground floor ⁄›kyamuni, who might have represented the emanation-body form ofVairocana, occupied the central position.797   796 Kapstein, The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism, p. 60.797 Kapstein, The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism, p. 61. We find the continued presence of SarvavidVairocana in the Nyingma School, which traces its roots to the traditions of the first dissemination ofBuddhism in Tibet. I learned from Khenpo Dorje Tashi, a prominent scholar from the Nyingma ⁄rıSimha Institute of Dzokchen Monastery in Kham, eastern Tibet, that the Nyingma school still has aSarvavid Vairocana ritual tradition. They refer to it as the “Purification of Bad Transmigrations Rite”(ngan song sbyong chog; *durgati-pariŸodhana-vidhi), rather than as the “Sarvavid Rite” (kun rig gicho ga; *sarvavid-vidhi), the convention employed in the Sarma schools.

As tantric Buddhism continued to develop in India, it quickly spread toChina, Khotan, Nepal, and many other locales in central Asia. Thus, the Tibetan       since contemporary Nyingma traditions have the ritual, historically they must also have had a tantrawhence the ritual came.Hugh Richardson discusses Vairocana images in the earliest temples in Tibet, which are attributed tothe seventh-century rule of Songtsen Gampo (Srong btsan sgam po), as well as in temples constructedduring the eighth century (Hugh Richardson, “The Cult of Vairocana in Early Tibet,” in HughRichardson, High Peaks, Pure Earth: Collected Writings on Tibetan History and Culture, ed. and intro.by Michael Aris [London: Serindia Publications, 1998], pp. 177-179).798 Kapstein, The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism, p. 61.799 Amy Heller, “Eighth- and Ninth-Century Temples & Rock Carvings of Eastern Tibet,” in Tibetan Art:Towards a Definition of Style, ed. by Jane Casey Singer and Philip Denwood (London: Lawrence KingPublishing, 1997), pp. 96-103.800 Kapstein, The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism, p. 63.801 This discussion is drawn from Kapstein, The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism, pp. 59-60."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in Tibet 305adoption of the Vairocana cult provided a common language to express imperial Tibetanpower to its neighbors in China, India, and central Asia. Moreover, by making theTibetan king and his empire homologous to Vairocana and his ma ̊ ̃ala, royal authoritycould be further asserted on the basis of this relationship—an important consideration foran administration governing an empire spread across central Asia.We can now formulate a clearer picture of the opposing forces at once driving andinhibiting the translation of tantras during the first dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet.One of the great concerns of the king and his court was maintaining order throughout thelarge Tibetan empire; thus, they attempted to restrict the translation and promulgation oftantric texts and practices involving violence, coercion, and the control of various forces,since such practices have the potential to undermine social and political stability. At thesame time, the adoption of the Vairocana cult provided the rulers with a means ofcommunicating imperial power across the linguistic and cultural borders of south, east,and central Asia. Thus, imperial authorization was given to translate the Purification ofAll Bad Transmigrations with its central practice of Sarvavid Vairocana (even whilecertain passages were proscribed) as well as an exegetical work on it by Buddhaguhya.The importance of the royal Vairocana cult can be seen also in its persistence amongsome of the petty kingdoms that arose after the disintegration of the Tibetan empire, as Iwill discuss below in the context of the second dissemination of Buddhism.Funerary CultsAnother important aspect of the Yoga Tantras that made them attractive to the pro-Buddhist faction of the ruling elite during the first period of transmission of Buddhism toTibet was undoubtedly its utility in death rites. As Kapstein and others have shown,mortuary rites were an important part of pre-Buddhist Tibetan culture. The rites fordeceased monarchs were of particular importance and required a specialized clergy toperform them. These rites, which reflect a well-developed system of beliefs concerning"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in Tibet 306death and the deceased,802 were referred to as Bön, a complex term frequently used torefer to pre-Buddhist religion as a whole as well as to a contemporary Tibetan religiousform that claims descent from such (although historically it can only be dated to aroundthe tenth or eleventh century). One of the few things we know with any certainty aboutthe pre-Buddhist Bön was that it was responsible for performing the mortuary rites fordeceased Tibetan kings.While the Compendium of Principles has a brief passage on drawing beings in badtransmigrations out of their unfortunate circumstances and sending them to a happyrebirth, death and practices related to it are of central importance in the Purification of AllBad Transmigrations. As I discussed in chapters two and three, the frame-story of thistantra revolves around the death of a long-life god named Vimalama ̊iprabha and hisrebirth in a hell, and funerary rites that the Buddha teaches to Vimalama ̊iprabha’s cohortIndra to extract the fallen god from hell. Many of the rites in the Purification of All BadTransmigrations are geared toward purifying bad karma and the bad rebirths in whichthey result.Because of its focus on death and rituals pertaining thereto, the Purification of All BadTransmigrations was particularly well suited to the cultural environment of eighth- andninth-century Tibet, and especially that of the imperial court. We find evidenceindicating its actual adoption in an early Tibetan Tun-huang text concerning death, inwhich a god modeled on Vimalama ̊iprabha and having a similar name appears.803Moreover, the last section of the Testament of Wa concerns the adoption of Buddhistfunerary rites as a replacement for Bön rites, with the catalyzing event being the funeralof Trisong Detsen.804 This certainly marked a watershed in the conversion of Tibet to   802 Kapstein, The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism, p. 5.803 Kapstein, The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism, pp. 5-7.804 Wangdu and Diemberger, dBa’ bzhed, introduction, pp. 10-11; translation, pp. 92-105."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in Tibet 307Buddhism, as the funeral of a deceased king (and by extension those of other aristocrats)was of utmost importance in Tibet.

One possibility is that the mention of the NineCrown Protuberances Ma ̊ ̃ala is a later interpolation (Sørensen dates the entire sectionon funerary rites to the ninth century).811 Another possibility is that a Nine CrownProtuberances Ma ̊ ̃ala tradition (and perhaps the later version of the Purification of AllBad Transmigrations itself) circulated in Tibet before the extant translation of the tantrawas made during the thirteenth century.Whatever the case, it is clear from evidence such as dynastic-period Tun-huang textsthat the Purification of All Bad Transmigrations was closely associated with rites for thedeceased in late imperial Tibet. This was of particular importance in the establishment ofBuddhism in Tibet, since the royal funerary cult (and, by extension, funerary cults ingeneral) held a central place in Tibetan social and religious life. Thus, the availability ofa specific and well-developed Buddhist ritual funerary apparatus that could replace theindigenous Bön cult undoubtedly was instrumental in the Tibetan conversion toBuddhism.

Although Lang Darma is vilified in laterhistories as a rabid anti-Buddhist, it is possible that this was not precisely the case. AsKapstein and others have argued, Lang Darma’s policy shift toward Buddhism mighthave entailed the reduction or withdrawal of royal patronage rather than the full-scalepersecution later Buddhist histories present.814In any case, with the assassination in 842 of Lang Darma—purportedly by theBuddhist monk Pelgyi Dorje (dPal gyi rdo rje)—the Tibetan empire began todisintegrate. This ushered in a period of political and social turmoil that would last formore than one hundred years. The state of Buddhism during this so-called “dark” periodis difficult to ascertain because there are few contemporary accounts concerning it. LaterBuddhist histories present a bleak picture in which monastic Buddhism completelydisappeared in central Tibet and was preserved only by a small number of monks whofled to the eastern and far northeastern provinces of Kham (khams) and Amdo (a mdo),respectively.815These accounts characterize this period as one of wide-scale degenerate religiousbehavior. Tales abound of lay tantric practitioners (some of whom were apparentlysupposed to be monks) taking literally the injunctions in the tantras to murder, fornicate,cannibalize, and so forth. For instance, Butön describes the situation this way:816   813 R.A. Stein, Tibetan Civilization, tr. J.E.

However, as Kapstein points out, there was still some governmentpatronage. At least some of the petty rulers who controlled various parts of the formerempire maintained an interest in Buddhism, as activities such as temple constructionindicate.818What is clear about the post-dynastic period is that, in the absence of a strong centralgovernment—and with the monastic presence and influence severely reduced (if indeed itpersisted at all, particularly in central Tibet)—lay tantric movements and theirquestionable behavior seem to have exploded.

These ‘robber-monks’ (ar-tsho bande, a-ra-mo ban-dhe) kidnapped andkilled men and women, ate them, drank alcohol and indulged in sexual intercourse (Stein,Tibetan Civilization, p. 71).818 Kapstein, The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism, p. 12."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in Tibet 312the first propagation of Buddhism in Tibet even while the government attempted toconstrain it, as the translation of the Compendium of Principles demonstrates.With the collapse of the empire, the previously unauthorized strands of Buddhismseem to have gained much fuller expression. In addition, it is likely that tantric texts andtraditions of practice continued to enter Tibet during this “dark” period, although it isdifficult to determine the extent to which this occurred. Although the official translationbureaus disbanded with the collapse of the empire, in all probability at least sometranslation activity continued during the “dark” period. Identifying with any certaintythese new texts and traditions is problematic, but they likely represented the latestdevelopments in Indian tantric Buddhism. These would have included the burgeoningcorpus of Mah›yoga texts and the Yoginı Tantras, in which the tendency toward extremeand antinomian practices involving sex, violence, and the like was becoming morepronounced. The disorder and anti-institutional flavor of these traditions (which Idiscussed in chapter four) was no doubt well suited to the chaotic cultural context ofTibet between the middle of the ninth and middle of the tenth centuries. Just as with thedevelopment of tantric Buddhism in politically decentralized medieval India, the ethosand ideology of tantric Buddhism in Tibet mirrored the violent and divisive social andpolitical landscape of the chaotic period following the collapse of the Tibetan empire.Yoga Tantra during the Second Dissemination of BuddhismThe accounts of Tibet during the period from the middle of the eighth century until thelatter part of the ninth century appear to justify the dynastic-period fears of King TrisongDetsen and his ministers concerning certain aspects of tantra, as the practice ofantinomian tantric activities proliferated and social chaos ensued (or vice versa). Royalconcerns about tantra reemerged towards the end of the tenth century and, according tolater accounts, this provided the impetus for the second period of the translation andtransmission of Buddhism to Tibet. In chapters one and two I discussed or referenced the"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Yoga Tantra in Tibet 313translations of Yoga Tantra texts and commentaries made during this period. Rather thanrepeating those lists here, I will focus on a few texts that illuminate the translationprocess and reflect broader issues involved in the second dissemination of Buddhism.Around the middle of the tenth century Yeshe Ö (Ye shes ’od), a king of western Tibetwho was descended from the dynastic-period ruling family, became a devout Buddhist.819Holding the opinion that all tantric systems had become degenerate since the fall of theempire, Yeshe Ö assembled a contingent of the most able and intelligent young men fromthe aristocracy of western Tibet and dispatched them to Kashmir for the purpose ofreturning with authentic and “orthodox” tantric texts and lineages.This marks the beginning of the second dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet.820 Wefind many of the same issues influencing the translation and transmission of tantricmaterial as shaped the earlier period, such as the concern about practices involvingviolence and sex, and particularly their effect on social stability and order. The tantrictraditions that were now palatable to royal tastes provide an important indicator of boththe state of tantra and the status of Yoga Tantra at this time. According to Butön, YesheÖ specifically instructed the delegation to study and bring back the systems of theCompendium of Principles, the Secret Assembly (Guhyasam›ja), and the Litany of Namesof MañjuŸrı.821   819 According to Butön, this king’s name was Khore (Khor re) before he took monastic ordination as YesheÖ (Butön, Ship, 71a.5).820 Buddhism—or at least Buddhist monasticism—must already have been reestablished in western Tibet atthis time, since according to the biography of Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055) he was ordained at agethirteen (Guiseppe Tucci, Rin-chen-bzaº-po and the Renaissance of Buddhism in Tibet around theMillenium, tr. Nancy K. Smith, Indo-Tibetica II [New Delhi: Aditya Prakashan, 1988], p. 28).

The Compendium ofPrinciples, which had previously been considered controversial and dangerous because ofits practices involving violence, was now perceived as a means of reestablishingauthentic (and therefore “safe”) tantric traditions. Despite the concern during theimperial period over its ideology, the Compendium of Principles now appearedconservative in light of the more radical standards of violence and sex found in latertantric developments included under the rubrics of Mah›yoga and Yoginı Tantra.Additionally, the benefits of a royal Vairocana cult continued to attract the ruling eliteto the Compendium of Principles and other Yoga Tantras.

Rinchen Zangpo and Lekpe Sherap did, however, train in⁄›kyamitra’s commentary, the Kosala Ornament. Interestingly, there is no mention ofBuddhaguhya’s commentary on the Compendium of Principles—the Entry into theMeaning of the Tantra—which was so important during the first dissemination ofBuddhism. One possible reason is that a translation already existed in Tibet and so therewas no need to translate it again, but this does not explain why the two translators did nottrain in this text. Another possibility is that the Entry into the Meaning of the Tantra wasnot important in Kashmir, perhaps because it did not gain a circulation outside centralIndia. This suggests variations in regional Indian traditions, which I will discuss below.According to Butön’s account, Rinchen Zangpo and Lekpe Sherap did not translateany texts during their first trip to Kashmir. They did, however, invite several of theirKashmiri teachers to western Tibet, of which Butön identifies the following by name: thepa ̊ ̃itas ⁄raddh›karavarman, Padm›karavarman, and Prajñ›karavarman (the threeKaras); Kamalagupta; Dharm›Ÿrıbhadra; and Kanakavarman.

He still could not locate a manuscript offinandagarbha’s Illumination of the Principles. Therefore, he took ⁄›kyamitra’s KosalaOrnament as the commentary on the Compendium of Principles and finandagarbha’sSource of Vajras as the practice text. As a consequence of this, he mixed the languageand exegetical system of ⁄›kyamitra’s Kosala Ornament with that of finandagarbha’sritual text. For instance, the main deity Vairocana is asserted to be like four people withtheir backs joined rather than like one person with four heads.829Rinchen Zangpo obtained a Sanskrit manuscript of finandagarbha’s Illumination of thePrinciples only when the translator Ngok Rinchen Gyeltsen (rNgog Rin chen rgyalmtshan) gave him one as an offering to receive the Secret Assembly tradition.830 RinchenGyeltsen had acquired this text in Nepal, along with Sanskrit manuscripts offinandagarbha’s Source of Vajras, Rite of the Conquest over the Three Realms Ma ̊ ̃ala,and Rite of the Nine Crown-Protuberances.

As Butön’s account details, Nepal was animportant repository for Sanskrit manuscripts from eastern India; this situation continuesto the present, as Snellgrove’s discovery in Nepal of a ninth or tenth-century Sanskritmanuscript of the Compendium of Principles from Bihar illustrates.Additionally, the manuscript Ngok Rinchen Gyeltsen gave Rinchen Zangpo was onlythe first part of finandagarbha’s Illumination of the Principles.832 Thus, anotherimportant factor in the translation process was the division of large texts into parts, whichapparently were at times separated from each other. This resulted in different parts of atext being translated at different times and, in some cases, by different translators.833Moreover, Butön relates that Rinchen Zangpo made a provisional translation of thefirst part of finandagarbha’s commentary by himself, without the collaboration of anIndian scholar.

Consequently, there were gaps in thetranslation of the first section and the beginning part of the second section, and the textfrom the latter part of the second section onward (that is, through the third and fourthsections) remained untranslated because the Indian text had not been located.836During his second trip to Kashmir, Rinchen Zangpo proofread the translations of thefirst section of the ⁄rı Param›dya as well as the commentary on it. However, because hestill could not locate Sanskrit texts of the commentary on the gaps in his translation of themantra section (that is, the second section of the ⁄rı Param›dya) or the second, third, andfourth sections of the tantra itself, he was unable to prepare translations of them.837Later, after Rinchen Zanpo had died, Indian texts of the root tantra of the ⁄rıParam›dya and the commentary on it were obtained from the Kashmir region.838 PrinceZhiwa Ö (lHa pho ’brang zhi ba ’od, a grand-nephew of Yeshe Ö) and the pa ̊ ̃itaMantrakalaŸa then filled in all the gaps and translated the text from the second section on.They used Rinchen Zangpo’s translation of the commentary on the first section and thefirst part of the second section, and then filled in the gaps in the latter part of the second   835 There is also evidence that an earlier translation of this section existed.

Certain elements of these tantras—inparticular, those involving ritual violence and black magic—concerned imperial officialsand elicited their proscription; this concern was borne out as antinomian and extremetantric behavior appears to have flourished during the period of social disorder anddislocation that followed the collapse of the Tibetan dynasty.At the beginning of the second dissemination of Buddhism, the Compendium ofPrinciples and other texts included under the rubric of Yoga Tantra were seen asconservative in relationship to the violence and sex of later tantric developments and thedeployment of such practices during the “dark” period. As such, the tantras of the Yogaclass were used to reestablished authentic tantric lineages and “correct” modes of tantricbehavior. This, in conjunction with its continued utility as a royal Vairocana cult as wellin funerary rites, resulted in Yoga Tantra traditions reaching the zenith of their influencein Tibet during the late tenth and eleventh centuries.

It is not until the compilation/ composition of theCompendium of Principles during the last quarter of the seventh century that matureIndian Buddhist tantra emerges, complete with its own mythology. The Compendium ofPrinciples is the locus classicus of two of the three foundational narratives of Buddhisttantra. The first of these myths recasts ⁄›kyamuni’s enlightenment in tantric terms—theprocess of the five manifest enlightenments. Not only did ⁄›kyamuni becomeenlightened through the tantric practice of the five manifest enlightenments, but he wasunable to achieve the ultimate spiritual attainment through any means except the latesttantric procedure of deity yoga. This establishes a distinct identity for tantra vis-à-visearlier forms of Mah›y›na Buddhism while also staking its claim to authenticity. We seethe importance of this narrative in the Compendium of Principles, the first mature"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Chapter 6: Conclusion 328Buddhist tantra: it serves as a self-conscious declaration of tantra as a new and distincttradition in which ritual is central, while simultaneously acting as a legitimizing agentand presenting the rituals in a colorful and detailed way.The contemplative process through which ⁄›kyamuni becomes enlightened, discussedin chapters one and three, involves first realizing the luminous nature of one’s mind.This realization then appears in the form of a moon disc and is further developed throughthe rest of the five-stage process, which culminates in ⁄›kyamuni’s transformation into acompletely enlightened Buddha. This is the earliest presentation, to my knowledge, ofthe practice of generating oneself as an enlightened Buddha figure—known as deityyoga—in a Buddhist tantra (eighth-century Indian exegetes ascribe deity yoga to earliertantras, but the passages on which they draw do not clearly identify the practice—andthere is nothing even remotely resembling the detailed description we find in theCompendium of Principles). Deity yoga is one of the distinctive characteristics of maturetantra, as is another aspect of each of the five stages in this process, the use of mantras(which, however, are also found in much earlier Buddhist texts).The second foundational tantric myth is the narrative of the Bodhisattva Vajrap› ̊i’ssubjugation of MaheŸvara. Here, we find the rationale for ritual violence and evenmurder that, as I mentioned in chapter one and then discussed again in chapter four,becomes more central in the later tantric developments classified as Mah›yoga andYoginı tantras. This myth, as I discussed in chapter three, reflects not only internalinfluences but also external pressures Buddhism faced in seventh- and eighth-centuryIndia, such as a decentralized and fragmented socio-political environment dominated bymilitarism, a decline in patronage for Buddhist monastic institutions, and the rise of⁄aivite sects—against which Buddhist monasteries were in directcompetition—espousing a rhetoric of violence."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Chapter 6: Conclusion 329The violence promoted in this narrative is in the service of Buddhist monasticinstitutions and focuses on the establishment and maintenance of Buddhist systems ofconduct and order. This likely reflects the development of large Buddhist monasteries atthe time, the competition with ⁄aivite groups for patronage, and the fractious socialsituation in India.The transformations the MaheŸvara subjugation narrative undergoes in later tantrassuch as the Secret Nucleus reveal a stronger antinomian and anti-institutional bent, as Idiscussed in chapter four. This is seen also in the increasing centrality of violence intantras included under the rubrics of Mah›yoga and Yoginı Tantra, as well as theincreasing centrality of sexo-yogic practices which, although found in germinal form inthe Compendium of Principles, are tangential to the main thrust of the tantra. The IndianMah›yoga figure and exorcist Padmasambhava, in both the Garland of Views attributedto his authorship and his activities in Tibet, perhaps discloses the process by whichMah›yoga tantras developed out of the Compendium of Principles and the corpus oftantras that grew directly out of it and were later classified as Yoga Tantra. A study ofthe Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga works of Padmasambhava’s teacher Buddhaguhya mightprovide concrete evidence concerning this development.The MaheŸvara subjugation narrative, together with a brief practice of sending beingsin bad transmigrations to a happier rebirth also found in the Compendium of Principles,presents a “liberation through slaying” ritual ideology for dealing with one’s enemies (orcompetitors) and others inimical to Buddhism. The latter practice gains full expression inthe Purification of All Bad Transmigrations, one of the most important texts of the corpuslater referred to as Yoga Tantra,. In both India and later in Tibet this tantra gainedpopularity, at least in part because it provides—and in fact revolves around—a completesystem of tantric funerary rites; additionally, it contains six other ma ̊ ̃alas designed forthe practical aims of controlling forces responsible for various maladies and misfortunes."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"Chapter 6: Conclusion 330The development of practical rites in India likely was fueled at least in part by theincreasing economic difficulties Buddhist monastic institutions experienced, since entryinto the field of death rites and other worldly rites undoubtedly increased revenue formonasteries.The third foundational myth of Buddhist tantra, while not presented in theCompendium of Principles itself, is closely related to this tantra. It occurs for the firsttime in Jñ›namitra’s eighth-century commentary on the Mode of the Perfection ofWisdom in 150 Stanzas, another tantra included in the Yoga class. In this origin narrativea set of eighteen tantras miraculously appear in the world. The practices that the masterKukkur›ja sets forth for King IndrabhÒti and his entourage from this corpus includemeditation on the Vajradh›tu Ma ̊ ̃ala, which explicitly links the myth with theCompendium of Principles.This narrative is shared with Mah›yoga systems, and the existence of eighteen-texttantric cycles in Indian materials preserved in both Chinese and Tibetan translationreveals deep continuities between Yoga Tantra and Mah›yoga, which I have discussed inchapter four. Further research into the Mode of the Perfection of Wisdom in 150 Stanzasand another Yoga Tantra closely associated with it, the ⁄rı Param›dya Tantra, wouldperhaps yield more evidence on the historical development of Indian tantra from YogaTantra to Mah›yoga and, more broadly, the relationship between non-tantric Mah›y›naand tantra. There is also the case of the Collection of All Procedures, the VajraŸekharaTantra of the Yoga Tantra corpus, and the Yoga of the Equality of All Buddhas Tantra ofthe Mah›yoga corpus, which I discussed in chapter four. Further research into these textsand their relationships might reveal important aspects of the historical development ofBuddhist tantra in India.In addition to its pivotal role in establishing a distinctly tantric identity throughproviding a mythological underpinning, the Compendium of Principles is also the source"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Chapter 6: Conclusion 331of several other important aspects of mature Buddhist tantra. The arrangement ofma ̊ ̃alas around a five Buddha-family structure rather than the three-family pattern ofearlier tantras as well as the fixture of Vairocana and his Tath›gata family in the center ofboth the ma ̊ ̃ala and the tantra as a whole were innovations of the Compendium ofPrinciples (although Vairocana does appear as the central figure in the ManifestEnlightenment of Vairocana, and the Tath›gata family was hierarchically superior inthree-family systems).In addition to the foundational role the Compendium of Principles played inestablishing and defining Buddhist tantra, this tantra also serves as the central text aroundwhich are constellated an important corpus of tantras. While some of these are moreclosely related than others, the Compendium of Principles and its associated textsrepresent the first true corpus of Indian Buddhist tantra. The VajraŸekhara Tantra andthe Conquest over the Three Worlds represent the debut of the explanatory tantra, whichamplifies, explains, and supplements the root tantra with which it is associated. We alsofind several other tantras of this corpus that further develop practices found in theCompendium of Principles, categorized under the rubrics of four other types of tantra:supplementary tantras, secondary supplementary tantras, concordant tantras, andelaborating or branch tantras.Over time, the Compendium of Principles and the body of texts that evolved around itwere, in some parts of India and Tibet, redacted into and understood as a tradition called“Yoga Tantra” in contrast to new tantric developments, such as those identified as“Mah›yoga” and “Yoginı Tantra,” that would displace them on the cutting edge of tantrictechnology. In East Asia, however, these later traditions never took hold, and thus theCompendium of Principles and its corpus of texts continued to be conceived as tantrarather than being reduced and classified into something called “Yoga Tantra.”"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Chapter 6: Conclusion 332In Tibet, the Compendium of Principles was a central tantra during the firsttransmission of Buddhism despite imperial concerns about practices involving ritualizedviolence and black magic. At the beginning of the second dissemination it served as ameans of reestablishing authentic and “safe” tantric lineages from India, as theantinomian aspects of later tantric developments seem to have exploded after the collapseof the Tibetan empire.The Purification of All Bad Transmigrations was also important in Tibet. As aconsequence of its utility as a funerary rite, it is the only Yoga Tantra practiced with anyregularity in contemporary Tibetan culture, although training in the Compendium ofPrinciples and other Yoga Tantras has been a part of the education of important Tibetanscholars since the eighth century."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"BibliographyAbbreviationsCatalogue of the Nyingma Edition: this refers to the catalogue of the Derge Kangyur andTengyur: Tibetan Buddhist Canon, Nyingma Edition.
