It is our duty to do one of two things, either to ascertain the facts, whether by seeking instruction or by personal discovery, or, if this is impossible, to select the best and most dependable theory which human intelligence can supply, and use it as a raft to ride the seas of life-that is, assuming that we cannot make our journey with greater confidence and security by the surer means of divine revelation.

Whether enlightenment is conceived of as Ifmerely\"the elimination of attachment, aversion and ig-norance, or is invested with such qualities as omniscience, omnibenevo-lence and miraculous powers, it is a state far beyond anything most of us have ever believed possible, let alone experienced. In the West, in particu-1ar' where secular and psychological views of human possibility have by and large replaced religious notions, traditional Buddhist descriptions of enlightenment most often are greeted either with incredulity or with a If demythologized\" reformulation along psychological or existential lines more palatable to the agnostic tastes of the late twentieth century. Westerners usually must reformulate traditional descriptions in or-der to assimilate them at all, and Asian Buddhists often choose to so as to ease their communication with an increasingly non-traditional audience. This may be fine, and may simply represent another of the periodic transformations undergone by Buddhism in the course of its adaptation to different cultural circumstances, but it ought to be re-membered that the meaning such a concept as If enlightenment\" may have for contemporary Westernized Buddhists is not the meaning it has had for most Buddhists in most places throughout the centuries. For traditional Buddhists, enlightenment was, and is, precisely the radical transcendence of the suffering of sa:qtsara outlined above, no more and no less-for the simple reason that traditional Buddhists still see the cosmos primarily through the lenses of the sa:qtsara-nirvar:ta cosmology so pervasive in Asia, particularly among Indians and peoples influenced primarily by India, such as the Sinhalese, Bur-mese, Thais and Tibetans. When, therefore, Tibetan lamas expound the four noble truths and describe the enlightenment that is the culmination of the Buddhist path, they are not being fanciful, they are not being metaphorical, and they certainly are not joking; they are describing a set of facts that fol-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 Is Enlightenment Possible? low from their paradigmatic assumptions about how the cosmos func-tions. Now, just as most Westerners do not question the secular-scientific paradigm from which they operate, so most tradi-tional Buddhists have been content to accept the cosmology presented by their culture, satisfied that it bore the weight of tradition, was so-cially and personally useful, and was not grossly contradicted by experiences they might have. On the other hand, there have been a great many Buddhists who recognized that Buddhist beliefs were not necessarily self-evident, could not simply be accepted on faith, and rested on problematic philosophical assumptions that needed to be defended rather than simply asserted. There were, in short, Buddhists who recognized that the Buddhist world-view, to be regarded as \"true\"-taken in its most common usage, as corresponding to the way things actually are in the cosmos-must be susceptible of validation by an uncommitted observer through the universally accepted means of perception and inference. Not all thoughtful Buddhists have be-lieved that Buddhist religious beliefs can thus be validated-some Madhyamikas and later \"logicians\" arguably are exceptions-but there does exist a tradition that takes such validation seriously, stemming from the Indian pandit Dharmakirti (seventh century C.E.) and con-tinuing to this day in Tibetan schools. When I began studying Buddhism seriously in Nepal in 1974, with the late Lama Thubten Yeshe and Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche (members of the dGe lugs school), the very first thing I was taught is that enlightenment is possible, and that the enlightenment that is possible is the transcendent state described by traditional Buddhist teachers and texts. A few cursory arguments (e.g., the mind is natu-rally pure) were offered, and we moved on, necessarily, to other topics. The initial assertion, however, that enlightenment is possible, re-mained in my mind as a sort of koan, sometimes taunting, sometimes promising, usually quite frustrating. Enlightenment, and the world-view on the basis of which it was asserted, simply did not correspond to anything I had known or conceived. The ultimate\" proof\" of enlight-enment, I was assured, lay in \"the pudding,\" i.e., in experiencing it. Being, however, for better or worse of a philosophical cast of mind, I sought some sort of prior rational assurance that the object of my quest was not a mere chimera. When, therefore, I persisted in my ques-tions to various Tibetan teachers whom I encountered, I found that, again and again, I was being directed to the same source: the Prama1Jasiddhi (\"Establishment of Authority\") chapter of Dharmakirti's PramaIJavarttika (\"Commentary on Authority,\" or, alternatively, \"Commentary yn [Dignaga's Compendium on] Authoritativeness\"). Here, I was told, was laid out in systematic fashion a logical proof of the reality of past"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Preface 11 and future lives, the truth of the four noble truths and the possibility of enlightenment. If I took the trouble to follow the arguments, I-and any reasonable person-would be convinced that the Buddhist view of the cosmos was, in fact, essentially correct. The 285 verses of the PramCiIJasiddhi chapter of the PramCi1JavCirttika are extant in Sanskrit, and have been translated completely into Eng-lish by Masatoshi Nagatomi (in his unpublished Harvard Ph.D. dissertation, 1957) and partially into German by F. Tillmann Vetter (1984). On their own, however, as is so often the case with \"root-texts,\" they are concise to the point of obscurity, and require commentary to be truly comprehensible. There are Indian commentar-ies on the PramCi1JavCirttika extant in Sanskrit, and there are Indian commentaries extant in Tibetan translation. However, because my en-tn§ into Buddhist philosophy was through the Tibetan tradition, specificially the dGe lugs school, I was directed eventually to the rNam 'grel thar lam gsal byed (\"Elucidating the Path to Liberation According to the PramaI!avarttika\"), written in the fifteenth century by rGyal tshab dar rna rin chen (1364-1432), one of the two spiritual\" sons\" of the great Tsong kha pa blo bzang grags pa (1357-1419), founder of the dGe lugs tradition. The rNam 'grel thar lam gsal byed is considered by most present-day dGe lugs pas to be the greatest Tibetan commentary on the Prama1Javarttika, and is most often the basis of contemporary dGe lugs pa expositions of Dharmakirti's logical system. In fact, as I worked my way through the Tshad ma'i grub pa (PramCi1Jasiddhi) chap-ter of rGyal tshab rje's commentary, I found that it was, indeed, an admirable work, providing a detailed outline of the structure of Dhar-makirti's argument, interpolating discussions on difficult points, and generally presenting the material in a manner detailed enough that the meaning was clear, but not so elaborately that the structure and direction of the argument were lost. It is a moot question whether in every case rGyal tshab rje reflects Dharmakirti's own viewpoint (it is highly doubtful that he does), but his commentary stands nevertheless as a useful gloss on Dharmakirti, and has value in its own right as the forerunner of a tradition of PramaIJavCirttika interpretation that still has knowledgeable and serious exponents today. It is, therefore, at least as \"alive\" as, say, Aquinas'Summa Theologiae, and ought to be re-garded with the same seriousness as other ancient and medieval philosophical works, whose idiom may no longer be our own, but which are not thereby invalidated, and which may, in fact, contain far more truth than we moderns suspect. This book is a revision of portions of my Ph.D. dissertation, \"Is En-lightenment Possible? An Analysis of Some Arguments in the Buddhist Philosophical Tradition, With SpeCial Attention to the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 Is Enlightenment Possible? Pramii1Jasiddhi Chapter of Dharmaklrti's Pramii1Javiirttika\" (University of Wisconsin, Madison, 1983). It is, centrally, a translation of rGyal tshab rje's commentary on the Pramii1Jasiddhi chapter of Dharmaklrti's Pramii1Javiirttika. My primary purpose is to expose DharmakirtilrGyal tshab rje's arguments as clearly as possible. Because this is philosophi-cally challenging material, however, it requires considerable contextualization. Thus, I have provided in Part I a lengthy analysis that sets Dharmaklrti's undertaking both within its Indian and Bud-dhist context and vis a vis Western discussions of truth and religious argument; in Part II I give some indications of this book's relation to other scholarship on Dharmaklrti and rGyal tshab rje, as well as guidelines for reading the translation; and, in Part III, the translation, I provide an extensive set of explanatory notes that, if unworthy of be-ing considered a sub-commentary to the text, nevertheless will, I hope, help make rGyal tshab rje and Dharmaklrti reasonably accessi-ble. In the translation itself, in order to indicate rGyal tshab rje's relation to Dharmaklrti's root-text, I have interpolated translations of the Tibetan translation of the verses at the beginnings of the sections in which they are discussed, and I have highlighted phrases from the root-text as they have been incorporated into the commentary. My translation of the Tibetan verses is geared toward rGyal tshab rje's in-terpretation, which does not always accord with a straightforward reading of the Tibetan verses themselves; I have tried to indicate those places where rGyal tshab rje significantly departs from the straightfor-ward reading. I also have included, in an appendix, a detailed outline of rGyal tshab rje's chapter, keyed to the translation, the edition of rGyal tshab rje's commentary I used, and Dharmaklrti's root-verses. My overall emphasis here is philosophical, so my introduction and annotations deal more with issues of philosophical context and mean-ing than with philological or historical matters. Thus, I have not attempted to trace in detail the course of Dharmakirti studies in India and Tibet, or to provide exhaustive cross-references to pramii1Ja litera-ture relevant to Dharmakirti's or rGyal tshab rje's discussions, though I hope such history and references as I do provide (most often geared to material available in Western languages) are useful. Nor do I at-tempt here a definitive translation of the Sanskrit verses of the Pramii1Jasiddhi chapter. Such a translation certainly is a desideratum (and we may hope that the lacuna soon will be filled by Prof. Naga-tomi), but my focus here is on rGyal tshab rje's Tibetan commentary, which was based on a reading of the Tibetan, not the Sanskrit, version of the Pramii1Javiirttika. Nor, as a consequence, do I undertake ,to study, except where there are notable discrepancies, the relation be-tween the Sanskrit original and the Tibetan translation. Furthermore-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Preface 13 and this may frustrate some readers-I do not attempt in any detail an evaluation of DharmakirtilrGyal tshab rje's arguments. Thus, I do not presume to answer the book's title question, as to whether enlighten-ment is possible. I have occasionally interjected philosophical observations into notes, and have devoted a section of Part I to dis-cussing some of the problems raised by the arguments, but I am mainly concerned simply to make available (and, I hope, comprehen-sible) to readers of English an important source of past and present Buddhist philosophizing, not to render judgment on it; I leave it to readers to decide for themselves whether the koan has a solution. My stylistic conventions bear only brief notice. I have maintained precise transliterations rather than phonetic spellings in my rendering of both Sanskrit and Tibetan terms. Transliterated Sanskrit presents lit-tle problem; Tibetan, on the other hand, is notoriously difficult to pronounce. I apologize in advance for any discomfort the Tibetan transliteration may cause the reader, but would add that it is only thus that precision can be assured. The words, in any case, are meant to be read and recognized visually, not pronounced, and I suspect that only a Tibetan can pronounce them properly, anyway. I have tried to reduce italics by treating as English words Sanskrit terms found in Webster's Third New International Dictionary-though I have preserved diacriti-cal marks (for a list of such terms, see R. Jackson [1982]). In Part I, which focuses on Indian Buddhism, I have generally favored Sanskrit terms, although Pali or Tibetan terms, where appropriate, are indicated parenthetically. Sanskrit terms that are conjectural are preceded by an asterisk. I have attempted not to clutter the translation with paren-thetical foreign terms, since most of them may be found in the Glossary, under the English words that translate them. A key to the abbreviations used in footnotes may be found at the beginning of the bibliography. My solution here to the still problematic quest for the perfect nonsexist singular pronoun is to adopt the gender-free \"they\" and \"them\", which I personally prefer either to \"he or she\" /\"him or her\" (which is unwieldy, and certainly never reflected in Sanskrit or Ti-betan texts) or to arbitrarily alternating \"he\" /\"him\" and \"she\" /\"her\"by paragraph or chapter (which can be downright confusi,ng).

Upaka's Shrug and the Sermon at Sarnath According to the Ariyapariyesana Sutta of the Pali Majjhima Nikaya, when the newly enlightened Buddha has been convinced by Brahma Saham-pati to preach his doctrine, and has decided first to seek out the five ascetics with whom he had formerly practiced austerities, he sets out from Uruvela-now Bodh Gaya-for Benares. Between the bodhi tree and Gaya, he encounters an Ajivika ascetic named Upaka, who remarks on Sakyamuni's serene and radiant demeanor. Upaka asks him under whom he has taken vows, who his teacher is, and whose doctrine he pro-fesses. The Buddha relpies, in verse: All vanquishing am I, all knowing, Untainted by any existent. All-renounced, I am freed through craving's destruction. Self-taught, whom should I declare [my teacher]? I have no master, my equal is unseen; In this world,with its gods, I have no rival. I, indeed, am sanctified, am the teacher unsurpassed; I alone, indeed, am perfectly enlightened; cooled, I have reached nirvana. - I go to Kasi-town to turn the Dharma-wheel; In this world grown blind, I beat the drum of deathlessness. \"Friend,\" remarks Upaka, ''It is as if you claim to be a saint, an unlim-ited conqueror.\" The Buddha replies: They are conquerors who, like me, have won the conta.rninants' destruction; I have conquered evil tendencies and so, 0 Upaka, I am a con-queror. Shrugging, Upaka replies, \"Perhaps, friend,\" and continues on his way.l"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 Is Enlightenment Possible? At the very outset of his career, then, before he has preached a word, the Buddha's claim to supreme attainment is doubted. In the Ariyapariyesana account, the Buddha then proceeds to Sarnath, where his five former companions greet him with the same familiar term of address as had Upaka: avuso, a word used primarily by senior religious persons in addressing their juniors, or clergy in addressing lay people, and best translated as \"friend,\" \"sir,\" or \"brother.\"z Unlike Upaka, however, the five ascetics are overwhelmed by the Buddha's charisma, and agree to listen to him. The Buddha announces to the ascetics that he is a tathagata, that deathlessness has been won, and that he will preach to them the doctrine through which they will learn for them-selves and come to possess \"that highest good to which the holy life conducts.,,3 In the Ariyapariyesana, the Buddha then proclaims the im-portance of overcoming attachment to the pleasures of the senses. He likens those who are attached to pleasure to a deer caught in a hunter's snare; those who are detached from pleasure are like deer free to roam the woods. The Buddha enjoins the practice of the dhyanas, (P. jhanas, meditative absorptions) and the subsequent at-tainment of the wisdom that utterly destroys one's defiling contaminants (asrava, P. asava) and blinds the Evil One, Mara.4 A far more famous version of the sermon at Sarnath is the \"Dis-course on Turning the Wheel of Doctrine,\"the Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya,5 wherein the Buddha expounds the \"four noble truths.,,6 These are: (1) the truth of suffering (duJ:tkha, P. dukkha), (2) the truth of suffering's origination (samudaya), (3) the 1 From sutta no. 26, M, i, 170-71.

There are many translations of this seminal sutta, e.g., Rhys Davids and Woodward (1950-56) V, 350; and Rahula (1978) 92-94. 6 \"Noble\" is perhaps not the most felicitous translation of anya (Sk. iirya), which may convey the rather stronger sense of \"holy,\" or \"sanctified\" (see Childers [1979] 57), and the term satya can denote not only a \"truth,\"but a \"reality,\"orwhat is the case. However, the expression \"four noble truths\"as a translation of caturanyasaccani (Sk. caturiiryasatyam)-coined, I believe by F. MaX Mliller-is so common now that I see no need to quibble with it.

The assertion of the truth of suffering entails the fact that there is suffering accompanying birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow and lam-entation, pain, grief, despair, association with the unpleasant, disassociation from the pleasant and unfulfilled desire-in short, that the five aggregates (skandhas, P. khandhas) that compose what we usu-ally call a person are suffering. The assertion of the truth of origination entails the fact that there is a cause for suffering, namely craving (tr~1Ja, P. tanha, literally, \"thirst\"), which is directed toward sense-pleasure (kama), the annihilation of pain (abhava), or further existence (bhava), and which generates further \"existence,\"i.e., rebirth. The as-sertion of the truth of cessation entails the fact that it is possible entirely to leave behind, or stop, craving and its resultant suffering. The assertion of the truth of path entails the fact that there exists a procedure whose outcome is the cessation of craving and suffering, here identified as the eightfold noble path, consisting of right views, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration . .As long, the Buddha notes, as he had not fully comprehended that suffering is to be understood, origination to be abandoned, cessation to be realized and the path to be followed, he was not perfectly en-lightened. Once, however, he realized that each of these \"truths\"was true, that each truth entailed an appropriate action, and that he had performed the appropriate action with regard to each, he knew that he had gained perfect enlightenment, and \"a vision of true knowledge arose in me thus: My heart's deliverance is unassailable.

The Buddha proclaims his attainment to all he meets, and may be greeted with either the skepticism of Upaka or the reluctant acceptance of the five ascetics, but in neither case is the mere fact of his charisma or his assertion sufficient to compel assent: Upaka disbelieves and does not linger for a sermon; the five ascetics hearken and are presented with four propositions whose truth they are invited to discover for themselves. Few truths come unattended; they usually are surrounded by a wraith-like host of presuppositions. The four noble truths are no ex-ception, for implicit in them are a number of cosmological and philosophical assumptions. In the most general sense, the four noble truths are posited against the background of a two-fold cosmological vision. The universe, in this vision, holds open two, and only two, pos-sible modes of existence for conscious beings: (1) the beginningless, ignorance-rooted experience-in life after life-of pain, sorrow, the tran-sience of joys, separation from the pleasurable, encounter with the 9 For better or worse, it is generally assumed by scholars that the least formulaic and philosophical material in the nikliyaslagamas is likely to be the most an-cient. The Sutta Nipata, part of which is regarded as very ancient on the basis of this and other criteria, contains virtually no reference to the four noble truths, the five aggregates, the twelve links of dependent origination, or many other\" original\" teachings of the Buddha. 10 At least in propositional form; there are, of course, briefer\" symbolic\" expres-sions of the whole Dharma, either verbal or non-verbaL Instances of the for-mer include various prayers, dharaJ).is, mantras or bijas (e.g., \"Hail to the Lotus Sutra\" = praise of the Buddha's greatest sermon = the essence of the Dharma; the letter a = voidness = the essence ofthe Dharma). Instances ofthe latter in-clude famous\" gestures,\" such as the Buddha's smile while silently holding a flower (the \"Flower Sermon\" of Zen lore), or the Tibetan yogin Mi la ras pa's dis-play of his buttocks, calloused from endless sitting in meditation. One \"pro-positional\" expression of the Dharma that is as concise as the four noble truths is the \"Buddhist credo\" often inscribed on post-Gupta statuary (but traceable to the Pc1li canon): \"Of those dharmas produced by causes, the Tathagata has. described the cause; and also their cessation: thus speaks the Great Recluse.\""},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Upaka's Shrug and the Sennon at Samath 23 unpleasant and unfulfilled desires; and (2) the incorruptible peace that is the cessation of suffering, and which results from the eradica-tion of the ignorance and craving that perpetuate that suffering. The universe, in short, holds open the possibilities of sarrsara and nirva~a. This cosmology, in turn, entails certain philosophical assumptions, which are, above all, assumptions about the nature and function of the mind: (1) the reality of past and future lives, which are contingent on the mind's independence of particular bodies; (2) the existence of a universal moral law, karma, that works with the same predictability in the psychological realm as causality does in the physical realm; (3) the fundamental perfectibility of mind, such that when its adventitious defilements have been removed one attains an undecaying liberated state that is beyond suffering, and makes the greatest of worldly joys seem infernal by comparison; (4) the possibility of control of the causal factors related to the universal moral law such that the liber-ated state can be attained. Assumption (1) bears most strongly on the truth of suffering, assumption (2) on the truth of origination, assump-tion (3) on the truth of cessation and assumption (4) on the truth of path. Common sense would dictate that if these four assumptions are true, the four noble truths are true, and that if any or all of them are false, then the four noble truths-and thus the Buddha's teaching-are at best partially true and at worst simply false. Here, however, there is a still more fundamental question that must be asked, namely: In precisely what sense are the four noble truths, along with their cosmological and philosophical presuppositions, \"true\"? The answer is not as self-evident as common sense might dic-tate, for the word \"true\" is in fact ambiguous-a fact recognized not only in the Western, but also in the Buddhist philosophical tradition. Thus, we find that there are, in fact, at least three possible ways of in-terpreting the statement, \"The four noble truths, along with their cosmological and philosophical presuppositions, are true\": 1. The facts and processes described by the four noble truths are \"literally\" true. In other words, such facts and processes as rebirth, karma, nirvaJ}.a, etc., have a reality independent of the terms that de-scribe them or the conceptual schemes out of which those terms arise. Furthermore, even if the terms that describe such facts and processes are limited by their location in a particular cultural-linguistic system, there nevertheless do exist facts and processes corresponding closely enough to those terms that they can be said to be /I true\" -and true not only for those in the cultural-linguistic world in which the terms are found, but in all possible worlds. In short, statements about the four noble truths and their presuppositions are literally and universally true: such facts and processes as rebirth, karma, nirvaJ}.a, etc., occur"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24 Is Enlightenment Possible? just the way the Buddhist texts indicate they do, and they occur for every possible person, even if that person has never heard of them. 2. The facts and processes described by the four noble truths are only figuratively or symbolically true. In others words, such facts or process'es as rebirth, karma, nirvaI),a, etc., either do not reflect realities independent of the terms that describe them, or cannot be ascertained to reflect such realities. Furthermore, such considerations are secon-dary, for the terms were taught not as a reflection of an inalterable extrinsic reality, but for their utility in providing images, symbols or stories that assist us in finding meaning in our lives, whoever or wher-ever we may be. Thus, not only is it possible (probable, even) that rebirth, karma, nirvaI),a, etc., are not realities in the literal sense in which they are described in Buddhist scriptures, but this probability is unimportant: their value-indeed the value of any truth-claim-is purely heuristic and utilitarian. 3. The facts and processes described by the four noble truths are true not independently and universall~ but only within the context of a particular conceptual scheme, world-view or language-game. In other words, such facts and processes as rebirth, karma, nirv~a, etc., may in fact be \"true,\"but only relative to the particular thought-world out of which they emerge, that of Indian Buddhism. If statements that describe rebirth, karma, nirvaI),a, etc., cohere comfortably within a Buddhist conceptual scheme according to Buddhist standards of ra-tionality, then the statements can be accepted as true, though they may not be true within another thought-world that is based on a dif-ferent set of presuppositions-e.g., that of a Yoruba, Christian or secular humanist. The reason that they can be accepted as true is that we never can discover an independent or neutral world outside the conceptual schemes that merely give us versions of the world. If reality thus is viewed as a collection of partially overlapping, non-ultimate conceptual schemes, then truth never can be more than adequacy to a particular conceptual scheme. Thus, statements about rebirth, karma, nirvaI),a, etc., are relatively true (and, of course, relatively false), and to expect more of them is to misunderstand the nature of truth-state-ments, which always are limited by and to the \"world\" in which they are made. Readers familiar with Western philosophy will have recognized in each of the preceding interpretations one of the classic theories of truth, namely truth as correspondence, pragmatic utility or coherence. Buddhists, of course, had no exact equivalents to these terms, nor for the majority of terms and issues that have concerned Western philoso-, phers of religion.

Thus, to apply Western theories to Buddhist truth-claims is by no means utterly arbitrary, for as we shall see shortly, each is a possible option from a Buddhist point of view as well. Before we examine Bud-dhist attitudes toward truth, and decide just what Buddhists mean by the claim that thefour noble truths are true, we may do well to explore at least generally the modern Western discussion of the problem of truth, and then see how that discussion bears on the more particular problem of the nature of religious truth-claims-of which Buddhist claims are a sub-set."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"2. Truth It may well be, as Ambrose Bierce has cynically suggested, that truth is simply 1/ an ingenious compound of desirability and appearance.\"l Though it certainly is the case that \"truth\"is a term used with decreasing confidence nowadays by philosophers, notions of truth and falsity seem among the most fundamental and universal of human mental structures. Indeed, I would be prepared to argue that the true-false dichotomy, broadly conceived, is a basic aspect of what existentialists like to call \"be-ing human\": human society-human life, even-is inconceivable without mechanisms for sorting and assessing information, and the most basic method of assessment is to categorize information as reliable or un-reliable, i.e., true or false. It may seem as if I am casting the net of truth-and-falsity rather widelrr but I would maintain that any informa-tion, whether verbalized or not, that can in principle be cast in the form of a statement is subject to truth or falsity. Thus, a once-burned infant's aversion to fire is an instance of the \"true-false structure\"in action (since the aversion could be recast as a statement, \"Fire is harmful\"), while a painting by Cezanne or a cantata by Bach is not-a Keatsian argument that the beautiful is the\" real\" criterion of the true notwithstanding. So much, a philosopher-and even Bierce in a sober moment-pos-sibly would concede, yet an admission of the centrality of the true-false dichotomy in human existence does not necessarily deter-mine what it is of \"true\" or \"false\"information that makes it thus, nor does it help us in deciding whether a given piece of information is, in fact, true or false. The instinctive, \"commonsensical\" approach to truth is to maintain, simply, that \"truth is agreement with reality-that it consists in a correspondence between (for example) a statement and 'the way things are'''2 and that\" a true proposition is one that corre-sponds to a fact-that is, to an actual state-of-affairs.\"3 This \"commonsensical\" definition of truth-upheld in pre-modern phi-1 Bierce (1979) 144. 2 Flew (1979) 73. 3 Hospers (1967) 116."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 Is Enlightenment Possible? losophy by such notables as Aristotle and Aquinas, and more recently by, e.g., Bertrand Russell and G.E. Moore-is what has come to be called the correspondence theory. Correspondence theories of truth generally have been marked, implicitly or explicitly, by the assumption that there does, in fact, exist a reality extrinsic to and at least partially independent of our statements about reality, and that our statements can more or less accurately represent that reality. Thus, for me to say that \"My cat, Mickey, exists\"is a true statement is to maintain that (a) Mickey does exist, regardless of whether I make any statement to that effect, and (b) there are reliable methods by which any reasonable per-son can confirm that Mickey does, in fact, exist. Correspondent truth-claims such as the foregoing, because they claim a kind of universal validity; often are regarded as \"strong\"or \"hard\"claims.4 The strength of a correspondence theory of truth is that it is firmly \"realistic,\" accepting the existence of independent data the analysis of which can result in a reasonably confident universal determination of whether a statement is true or false. The theory's weakness is that inde-pendent, universal data are notoriously hard to find. Indeed, much of the last hundred years of Western philosophy has seen a retreat from tra-ditional certainties regarding the objectivity and clear comprehensibility of the world-beginning perhaps with Nietzsche's espousal of an epistemological and moral perspectivism, which has been echoed in various ways in, e.g., Wittgenstein's contention that language relates not to some extrinsic \"reality\"but to itself; Gadamer's analysis of the \"hermeneutical circle\" whereby our \"knowledge\" of phenomena is structured by the interpretive methods we bring to bear on them; Derrida's \"deconstruction\" of the essentialist \"logocentrism\" of Western literary and philosophical theorizing; the attack, by Good-man and many others, on epistemological \"foundationalism\" Quine's postulation of \"ontological relativity\"; and Berger and Luckmann's analysis of the degree to which human \"reality\"is a social construct.s Even in the so-called \"hard sciences,\" Einstein's theory of relativity and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in physics, G6del's theorem in mathematics, and various physiological studies that demonstrate the 4 For a good discussion of the varieties of correspondence theory, see Prior (1967).

Indeed, much of the data that is used to support a truth-claim can be shown to be theory-laden to one degree or another, \"made\"in ac-cordance with the dictates of a particular theoretical construct as much as it is \"found.\" Thus, it is open to some question whether (a) there is an objective referent to which our statements correspond, and (b) even if there is, we would have any way of knowing or showing the fact. The weaknesses inherent in the correspondence theory have given rise to alternative attempts to explain truth, the two most notable of which are the pragmatic and coherence theories. These both entail what we might call \"weak\" or \"soft\" truth-claims, since both eschew the universal, demonstrable objectivity sought by correspondence theory. Indeed, the two overlap in significant ways, but we shall first consider them separately. The pragmatic theory of truth-whose most famous exponent was William James, and whose most recent may be Richard Rorty-is based on'the premise that a true statement should not, and perhaps cannot, be shown finally to correspond to some extrinsic objective re-ality that \"causes\" it, and that what, in fact, characterizes true statements is their \"utility\" or \"efficacy\" in promoting particular pur-poses or effecting particular results-in short, whether they \"work\" or \"pay.\"Truth-claims thus are seen very much as functions of specific human activities, and will be adjudicated on the basis of their success or failure in furthering either those activities or our overall \"satisfac-tion.\"Here, the statement \"My cat, Mickey, exists,\" is seen as true not because it \"represents\" some objective fact about the world, but be-cause a \"cat\"is comprehensible within a scheme of human purposes, e.g., as a pet whose presence (usually) adds to the pleasure of one's existence. We understand how a cat \"works,\" what its benefit is, and thus can assign to the identification of Mickey both meaningfulness and truth. It appears that-at least in James'version of pragmatism-the\" fruit\" (as opposed to the\" root\") is so thoroughly determinative of truth that even if no one else will confirm that I have a cat, my asser-tion of his existence may be regarded as true if it helps contribute to my overall happiness, i.e., if my \"fictional\" Mickey fulfills the same function in my life as an \"actual\" cat would. \"Fictional\" and\" actual\" must be set apart in quotes because the distinction between them is in-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 Is Enlightenment Possible? troduced as an attempted correspondence \"reality-check,\" and this, of course, the pragmatist considers of secondary importance.6 The coherence theory of truth maintains that\" a statement is true if it 'fits' or coheres with the system of other statements that we take for granted.\"7 The theory traditionally has been associated with rational-ism and idealism, and in particular with such figures as Leibniz, Hegel and Bradley. More recently, it has gained renewed respectability, either directly or indirectly, through the work of Wittgenstein and his succes-sors in the analytic tradition. It is the latter-day versions of coherence theory that I will summarize here. According to more recent versions of the theory, a true statement cannot be shown to correspond to some extrinsic objective reality, because there is no reality extrinsic to state-ments about reality: there is only the reality that is provided by one or another conceptual scheme, world-view, or language-game, and real-ity as is various as the systems by which it can be described. Thus the statement, \"My cat, Mickey, exists,\"is true in the sense that Mickey can be assigned existence within a given set of parameters: he is real if re-ality is granted to conventional objects whose presence is perceptually confirmed, if his presence is confirmed intersubjectively, if the term \"cat\" is meaningful within the linguistic world in question, and if ob-servation of Mickey leads to agreement that he fulfills the definition of a \"cat.\"The statement thus is true to the degree that it coheres with a particular set of assumptions about the world, and is true only relative to those assumptions; it will not be true if the word\" cat\"has no mean-ing' or Mickey does not fulfill the definition of \"cat,\" or there is doubt as to his observability (perhaps he is a Cheshire Cat!), or we are apply-ing some different criterion of existence, e.g., a Platonic or a quantum or a Madhyamika criterion, by which his\" existence\" is provisional at best. The pragmatic and coherence theories, of course, are not nearly so simple as I have portrayed them-they are subtler, and each term may cover a range of views. The two theories are distinct approaches to the truth, arising out of unique problematics and each possessing its own strengths and weaknesses. Pragmatic theory has the specific strength of showing the pervasiveness of concerns with \"utility\" in matters 6 On the pragmatic theory in general, see Ezorsky (1967). For a contemporary version of pragmatism, see Rorty (1982). On the question whether non-exis-tent entities can be considered\" true \"according to pragmatic theory, see Russell (1959) 134-5.

See also the discussion in White (1967)."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Truth 31 often taken to be \"objective,\" and the weakness of confusing psycho-logical utility with \"warranted assertability\"-not to mention failing to account for the ambiguity of \"utility\" at the time of a truth's asser-tion. Coherence theory has the specific strength of showing the embeddedness of truth -claims, and the weakness of making the argu-able assumption that all truth-claims share features of a priori systems like mathematics-not to mention failing to explain how mutually in-coherent systems might be understood comparatively. At the same time, though, the pragmatic and coherence theories have a number of features in common, and it is upon those that I will focus here. Their common strengths include (a) the vital realization that the objectivity sought by a correspondence theory is difficult, if not impossible, to attain, because the object is almost impossible to find apart from the purposes and presuppositions that inform the act of finding it; thus, the very processes by which we would find the ob-ject are limited, relative, without ultimate foundation; (b) the healthy recognition that there are many ways of approaching and describing the world, and that it is only with great difficulty that we can reduce all others to one description or declare unilaterally and with total con-fidence that this way is \"true\" and that way \"false\"; and (c) the sensible insistence that truth-claims cannot and should not be understood without reference to the cultural-linguistic and existential matrices in which they appear-for it is according to the axioms of particular con-ceptual schemes that truth or falsity actually is determined. The common weaknesses of the pragmatic and coherence theories can be summarized in a singleword: relativism. If the objectivity, universality and ontological and epistemological foundations assumed in corre-spondence theory are abandoned, then are we not left with a kind of pluralistic insularity, in which \"the world\" actually consists simply of the totality of possible interpretations and/or descriptions of the world, each of which may be understood and judged, finally, only from within a particular interpretive scheme? Proponents of pragmatic or coherence theories generally deny the charge of relativism: they will claim that statements still can be \"true\" or \"false\" to the degree that they contribute to our purposes and/or cohere with a particular mean-ingful scheme. This sort of truth or falsity, though, clearly is a relative matter, and cannot be settled ultimately by recourse to anyover-arch-ing set of data or criteria, because no such data or criteria exist: there are no meta-tests for truth or falsity, and so truth is at best provisional. To my mind, this is relativism.8 The theories of truth outlined above have been presented as if they were quite incompatible, but in fact they actually are intertwined in complex ways, for it is difficult even to describe the function of one"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 Is Enlightenment Possible? without introducing the others. The correspondence theory may ap-peal to universality and objectivity, yet we seldom make truth-claims that are not \"pragmatic\"in the broad sense of the word, i.e., intended to assist in the fulfilment of particular human aims; nor do we ever make truth-claims that do not arise within a particular cultural-lin-guistic-hence conceptual-matrix, and whether or not a truth-claim has universal import it must at the very least cohere with the particu-lar scheme from which it originates. The pragmatic theory may concentrate on a truth-claim's utility in furthering our aims, but whether or not the truth-claim actually furthers our aims ultimately may be understood in terms of its coherence with the conceptual scheme from which it originates and/or its correspondence to realities assumed or demonstrated to be \"the way things are.\"9 Coherence theory may dispense with the search for universal objectivity; and con-centrate on a truth-claim's consistency with the conceptual scheme in which it is found, but a particular II coherent\" claim has little impor-tance if it does not further some human aim and-as I shall argue shortly-if one is to discuss, move among and adjudicate contradictory or variant truth-claims from differing conceptual schemes, some over-arching criteria of correspondence would seem to be indispensable. Thus, all of the traditional theories of truth have significant strengths and weaknesses, and are parasitic upon each other in subtle but important ways. Nevertheless, I believe that the most basic seJ;lse of the word \"truth\"both is and must be as correspondence. It may be, as the more sophisticated proponents of the pragmatic or coherence theory maintain, that there simply is no basis for upholding corre-spondence, that the theory's epistemological and ontological underpinnings have been stripped away by the contributions of mod-ern physicists, mathematicians, anthropologists, philosophers (both analytic and phenomenological), physiologists and psychologists. However, the tendency to posit some kind of ultimate certainty per-sists, not just as a psychological need-a II correspondence complex\" left over from our philosophical childhood-but as a very real philo-sophical requirement. Simply put, unless we assume that there actually exists a unique '''real world' that is independent of human 8 OD the very complex question of the nature of relativism, see Hollis and Lukes (1982), Krausz and Meiland (1982) and Krausz (1989). 9 James himself seems to admit as much when he claims (1955:172) that a useful truth ough t to be believed II unless the belief incidentally clashes with ... the rest of our truths.\""},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Truth 33 mental activity and human symbolic language,,,lO we cannot sensibly describe or adjudicate among our various· conceptual schemes as we do, nor even alternate among them-whether we make the trivial switch from a checkbook-balancing conceptual scheme to a novel-reading one or make the profound move from one culture to another. It may be argued that the over-arching \"real world\"that we posit to tie together our multiple worlds is itself either (a) simply another particu-lar conceptual scheme, and not, therefore, really over-arching, or (b) if free from such particularity, then virtually empty of meaningful con-tent, hence a basis for adjudicating only trivial questions. It is undeniable that any scheme, even that of a \"real world,\" is still a par-ticular scheme-short of that in the mind of God or a buddha, any scheme will be particular. This does not, however, mean that, a fortiori, such a scheme is delusory or useless. With appropriate obeisances to the difficulty of attaining objectivity and the pervasiveness of conception in our perception of reality, it still may be possible to derive a set of assumptions universal enough to adjudicate non-trivial cross-sche-matic truth-claims. Or, perhaps it is less a question of deriving such an ideal set as of observing closely how all of us (pragmatists and coher-entists included!) make the distinctions and adjudications that we do-for to function without collapsing into solipsism or relativism, we all must and do posit that there is a way the world is and that there are more or less adequate ways of describing that world. Granted, this world may be \"merely posited,\"but it has priority among the schemes we posit, hence such objectivity as may be possible. As a result, corre-spondence, however modified and cautiously applied, remains the basic criterion of truthY In sum, our discussion of truth may seem to issue in a paradox: there is no real basis for believing that a given truth-claim can find universal agreement or foolproof demonstration, but the plurality of truth-systems that results when we abandon the quest for universality and certainty seems finally to entail a relativism that renders the very concepts of truth and falsity meaningless-since in a thoroughgoing relativism, every statement is true. Because we cannot function with-out the true-false dichotomy, we cannot accept relativism, and yet if we are to avoid relativism, we must presume standards by which we can adjudicate variant truth-claims from different systems. Such 10 Bruner and Feldman (1986) 46. 11 For a variant and considerably more detailed version of the same argument, see Griffiths (1991) chapter 2."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 Is Enlightenment Possible? standards are very difficult to find, but I think that we do and must presume such standards. To do so is to presume over-arching criteria of \"reality\" and its determination, and therefore to concede, finally, that statements, in order to be \"true,\"must \"correspond\"to some real-ity beyond the conceptual scheme in which they are found-even though one must be exceedingly cautious in assuming or describing the existence of such a reality."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"3. Religious Truth The foregoing discussion of \"the problem of truth\"has been an exceed-ingly general one-there are complexities and ambiguities involved at which I have not even hinted1-but it does, I hope, at least provide a rela-tively clear background against which we can now consider a more specific aspect of the same problem, namely, the question of what we are to make of religious truth -claims. Because I will begin discussing Buddhist truth -claims in the next section, I will restrict myself here primarily to ex-amples drawn from the Christian tradition, whose parallels with the Buddhist examples to follow may be inferred by the reader. If, as has been argued above, most people instinctively adopt the commonsensical definition of truth as correspondence to a reality ex-trinsic to the truth-claim itself, it seems reasonable to assert that this also is the case in the realm of religion. Thus, the Christian claim that \"Jesus was resurrected from the dead\"means precisely what it seems to: that the resurrection of Jesus is a historical fact, attested by eye-witnesses, that occurred regardless of whether anyone chooses to believe that it occurred; similarly, the claim \"God exists\" means that there really does exist an entity not entirely unlike what Christians predicate when they use the word\" God,\" and that God exists quite in-dependently of anyone's assertion of his existence. There is little question that, throughout most of history-and today in places where modern thought has yet to be strongly assimilated-people have made and believed religious claims in the hard sense entailed by cor-1 For informed and stimulating analysis of the issues raised in this and the pre-vious section, see, e.g., Barbour (1974) and Hollis and Lukes (1982), especially the introduction and Lukes' essay, \"Relativism in Its Place.\" Each of these books makes points similar to mine. Barbour defends what he calls\" critical realism,\"(\"in both science and religion there are experiential data and criteria of judgment which are not totally paradigm dependent\"[172J) over against an \"instrumentalism\"that assumes that all models are \"useful fictions.\"Hollis and Lukes uphold \"rationality\" -the acceptance and utilization of universal standards of translation and judgment-against a relativism that denies that there can be such standards."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36 Is Enlightenment Possible? respondence theory: Jesus \"really\"rose from the dead, God \"really\"ex-ists, Allah \"really\"spoke to Muhammad via the angel Gabriel, a messiah \"really\"will come to save the Jews, Krishna \"really\"took form as Arjuna's charioteer, we \"really\"have lived before and may live again, we \"really\" may attain someday a peace that passeth understanding. If the correspondence theory has difficulties even in its everyday application, its problems in the religious arena are even more severe, for religious truth-claims have special characteristics of their own, the most important of which are universality and metaphysicality. In most places and times, each religious world-view has claimed to be the most adequate possible description of \"the way things really are.\" Competing descriptions have been regarded as either false or incom-plete. The actual structure of the cosmos and blueprint for human action have been said to have only one truly satisfactory formulation, and fulfilment of one's ultimate purpose as a human being has been dependent on understanding and applying that one formulation. At the same time, a religious world-view almost always has entailed the assertion of realities that transcend the physical plane, and which are not, therefore, susceptible to the same kinds of empirical checking procedures that we might apply to, say, my assertion of the existence of my cat, Mickey. Each of these special characteristics of religious truth-claims creates special problems. The claim of universality is problematic not only because actual or possible evidence for the truth of universal claims is difficult to produce, but also because it is clear that the various religions of the world provide multiple, often conflict-ing versions of \"universal\" truth and that, in the absence of absolutely compelling evidence, one's insistence on the truth of one universal claim and the falsity or partial truth of the others is probably arbitrary, a question of dogmatic preference. The claim that metaphysical realms or entities are \"real\"in some very important but unconventional sense is problematic because evidence for the existence of such realms or entities is likely to be inconclusive if we follow the canons of ordinary empirical or scientific evidence, while the extraordinary evidence sup-plied by scripture or faith or religious experience is difficult adequately to adjudicate between one religious tradition and another. Because hard claims to religious truth often result in dogmatism, supernaturalism, or both, and because neither of these tendencies is favored by the scientific world-view that is the touchstone of modern thought, many modern religious people have chosen to abandon the correspondence theory, and have, instead, adopted the softer approach of pragmatism or coherence. The pragmatic approach to religious statements, not surprisingly, downplays the objective verifiability of their truth, and emphasizes in-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Religious Truth 37 stead their utility in contributing to our happiness or sense of purpose or authenticity. Thus, James writes, \"If theological ideas prove to have a value for concrete life, they will be true, for pragmatism, in the sense of being good for so much.,,2 One recent trend that I would consider pragmatic regards religious assertions not as confirmable philosophi-cal propositions, but as \"stories,\" or, to employ E.M. Hare's term, \"bliks,\" which are \"factually empty statements\" that are meaningful \"as principles by which one lives and in accordance with which one interprets experience.,,3 Similarly, KB. Braithwaite claims that relig-ious language is \"the statement, but not the assertion, of certain stories.\"4 Although not \"factual,\"these stories are more than the mere expression of feelings: they are a declaration of adherence to a policy of action and a way of life. Whether or not they are\" actually\"true, they tend, like great fiction, to give us psychological support in the form of a meaningful vision of life or certain aspects of life.5 Like the\" story\" approach, Rudolf Bultmann's attempt to \"demythologize\" the Chris-tian tradition is broadly pragmatic. According to Bultmann, we in the modern era no longer can accept the literal veracity of most Biblical statements, for those statements are rooted in an ancient world-view that we have transcended. Rather, we must read the Bible \"existen-tially'\" for its stories and statements still can provide symbols rich enough to generate meaning in lives lived in a world far in space, time and concept from that of the Bible.6 In these broadly pragmatic ap-proaches to religion, then, the claim that \"Jesus was resurrected from the dead\" mayor may not be a historical occurrence-what is impor-tant is that Jesus' resurrection can serve as a story to inspire us to love God or live a moral life, or as a powerful symbol of our own attempts to move from the\" death\" of inauthentic existence toward an authentic life. Similarly, the claim that \"God exists\" mayor may not be objec-tively true, and probably is not verifiable even if it is.

Coherentist interpretations of religious truth-claims center on the notion that the universality of a particular world-view never can be demonstrated, and that the truth of a religious statement-which al-ways arises within a particular system-must be determined by its consistency (or coherence) with other statements taken to be true in that system. While the application of coherence theory is implicit in many discussions of religion grounded in the language-game theory of VVittgenstein or the analysis of religion as a \"cultural system\" by such anthropologists as Clifford Geertz (as well as in the attempts of members of different religious traditions to engage in dialogue) one of the more interesting explicit attempts at its application has been made by George Lindbeck. Lindbeck argues that religious doctrines are to be taken \"not as expressive symbols or as truth claims, but as com-munally authoritative rules of discourse, attitude, and action,,,7 and that doctrines \"are not first-order propositions, but are to be con-strued as second-order ones; they make ... intrasystemic rather than ontolOgical truth-claims.\"s Thus, the statement that \"Jesus was resur-rected from the dead\" is not a universal claim so much as a statement that is true within the set of assumptions governing the conceptual scheme or language-game that is Christian doctrine, and may be in-volved less with asserting a fact than helping to regulate the thought and action of those who adhere to the Christian scheme of things. Similarly, the assertion that \"God exists\" cannot be expected to be either true or meaningful within a non-theistic context, while within a theistic framework like that of Christianity, it is meaningful, at least arguably demonstrable, and determinative of thought and action. The advantages of pragmatic or coherence explanations of religiotis truth-claims ought to be obvious: they reduce considerably the\" cog-nitive dissonance\" entailed by the assertion of universal metaphysical truths in an era marked intellectually by pluralism and materialism. By placing in abeyance questions of the literal truth of religious asser-tions, modern religiOUS people are able to \"eat the cake\" of a 7 Lindbeck (1984) 18. 8 Ibid:,80.

Certainty may be sacrificed, but dogmatism is avoided, rationality pre-served, and existential relevance assured. At the same time, the disadvantages of a pragmatic or coherence approach to religion are considerable. Most fundamentally, each en-tails a relativism that makes meaningful truth-decisions difficult if not impossible, and thus vitiates the true-false dichotomy that we have identified as an integral aspect of human existence. The dilemma en-countered by the pragmatist or coherentist seems inescapable: if all stories or conceptual schemes are equally true (as ought to be the case, since there is no meta-test for ranking them outside their own bor-ders), then relativism ensues; if the relativism is denied, then some meta-test or over-arching standard of truth must be assumed, hence a greater or lesser degree of\" correspondence\" of conceptual schemes to this over-arching standard. As noted before, to argue that this implicit meta-scheme is still \"just another scheme\"is sophistry, because its de-gree of universality gives it a reality and objectivity against which all other schemes must be measured; whether or not it ultimately is a construct, it functions as the \"real world.\" We have noted above that two of the most distinctive traits of tradi-tional religious truth-claims were universality and metaphysicality. One or the other or both of these is abandoned by the pragmatic or coherence approach (the metaphysics rather more prominently by the former, universality by the latter), and the question must be raised whether in the absence of universality and metaphysics, what we are discussing still is \"religion.\" If universality is -abandoned, then one's faith becomes simply one among a vast number of world-views, each of which, it appears, has an equal claim to validity, and none of which, therefore-including one's own-can provide any firmer claim to one's allegiance than any other. This extremely tolerant view is acceptable only as long as one does not pause to consider the fact that many of the\" equally valid\" systems to which one might adhere are utterly incompatible, since they make conflicting claims about the way things are. As human beings, we in-evitably must discriminate between true and false, and this is no less the case in regard to our views of the ultimate nature of things. Each of us-whether or not it can be justified-establishes an epistemo-logical and ontological fulcrum on which to pivot our functioning in the world.

If metaphysics is abandoned, then how much of \"religion\" actually remains? If the resurrection, or God, are simply edifying stories or \"meaningful\" concepts that may as well be fictitious, or only are true within a particular scheme, then it is difficult to say what distinguishes a \"religious\"person from a secular humanist apart from their choice of symbolic language. If we are to regard any all-explanatory symbolic language-system as a religion, then we must admit humanism, Marx-ism and hedonistic materialism, among others, to the list of religions, and we begin to attenuate the term \"religion\" so much as to threaten its usefulness.9 I would argue, therefore, for the rather traditional view that a religion is not fully a religion unless it claims universality and refers to a metaphysical realm and/or entities, and that the compromises wrought in religion by acceptance of a pragmatic or coherence theory of truth rob it of some of its most vital characteristics. It is entirely possible-probable, even-that, despite the foregoing objections, the term \"religion\"will in fact undergo a change such that it no longer is tied to claims regarding universality or metaphysical re-ality-people who call themselves religious, after all, will determine the meaning of \"religion\"themselves. At the same time, I think it is undeniable that what most people at most places and times have meant by their \"religion\" is just such an all-explanatory, universal, metaphysically rooted world-view, and that most people, therefore, have believed that the truth-claims of their religion are true in the strongest sense of the term, i.e., as corresponding to actual states-of-affairs. In-deed, if I may be permitted a tum on the ontological argument for God's existence, I would maintain that, given the equal plausibility (or, at least, necessity) of each of the three traditional theories of truth, a religious person perforce will opt for correspondence, for correspondence per-mits to the realities described by religion the greatest certainty, the greatest universality, the greatest\" actuality\" -existence that is actual rather than merely imaginary.

I suspect that Hick's argument points the way that many modem people will take in reformulating their sense of \"relig-ion,\"but in its reduction of religion to a virtually contentless lowest common denominator, it deprives particular traditions of the ultimacy of many of their most important claims about the cosmos and, by levelling out any claims other than the assertion of the \"Real,\" effectively approaches the relativism implied by pragmatic or coherence approaches. 11 Donovan (1976) 4. 12 Ibid., 97. 13 Griffiths (1991) 3; cf.

Truth in Buddhism In the light of what we have discovered about the indispensability of cor-respondence as a criterion of truth, especially where religion is concerned, we should not be surprised if, when we analyze the sorts of truth-claims made in Buddhism, correspondence (though not named as such, of course) turns out to be the most fundamental criterion, and that the Buddha asserted the four noble truths and their cosmological and philosophical presuppositions in a literal or \"hard\" sense. That the Bud-dha did adhere to a correspondence criterion has been argued by the philosopher Walter Kaufmann, who maintains in his Critique oj Religion and Philosophy that the four noble truths are both cognitive and mean-ingful, and that \"the Buddha himself seems to have considered acceptance of four propositions essential for salvation. His Four Noble Truths ... were clearly meant to be unambiguous,,,l and \"to be taken lit-erally.\"2 If the four noble truths and their presuppositions are to be taken lit-erally, then there \"really\" are past and future lives at various points on the wheel of rebirth, which means that the mind \"really\"must be in-dependent of particular bodies; there \"really\" exists a universal moral law in accordance with which every mental, vocal or physical action will engender an appropriate result; the mind \"really\"is capable of at-taining a state in which all suffering has been eliminated forever; and there\" really\" do exist extraordinary practices, such as meditation, that can assure the attainment of such a state.

A. SOME BUDDHIST REVISIONISTS Given the sort of cognitive dissonance produced by the literal espousal of the Buddhist world-view in a modern setting, the temptation arises to ex-plain Buddhism, either to oneself or to others, more along the lines of a pragmatic or coherence approach to truth. Thus, the Buddha did not \"re-ally\" mean the four noble truths to be taken literally-rather, they are stories to help us live our lives better, symbols to give meaning to our ex-istence, statements valid only within the limited conceptual scheme that was the world-view of ancient India. A number of modern Western (or Westernized) commentators have, in fact, adopted this idea. Some early British students of the Pali canon believed they had found in the Buddha an ancient exponent of the positivism of their own day, and explained away such alien notions as rebirth and nirval!a aS,at best, metaphors whose real intent was to describe psychological states and, at worst, later interpolations by devious monks who sought to distort the Master's mes-sage. Recently, the most egregious-and, unfortunately, influential-exponent of this view has been the late Alan Watts, who writes that Buddhists ... who understand their own doctrines profoundly, who are in fact liberated, do not believe in reincarnation in any literal sense. Their liberation involved ... a liberation from be-ing taken in by social institutions; it is not a liberation from be-ing alive.3 Further, for Watts, \"The individual's multitude of lives is interpreted as the multitude of his physical and social relations.\"4 This psychologi-cal explanation of rebirth and liberation-of sal'!lsara and nirval!a-is echoed in many of the equally influential works of the late Tibetan lama, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, who writes, for example, that the traditional six realms of sal'!lsaric existence (those of gods, titans, hu-mans, animals, hungry ghosts and hell-beings) are \"psychological states of being ... different kinds of projections, the dream worlds that we create for ourselves.\"s As for the four noble truths, duhkha is an as-sertion 6f our \"neurosis,\" samudaya an analysis of \"how ~go develops .••. 3 Watts (1961) 67. j .,-1 Ibid., 76. ;\\~,\\Trungpa (1973) 131."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Truth in Buddhism 45 and operates,\" nirodha the recognition that \"there is a sane, awake quality within us,\" and marga \"the practice of meditation.\"6 Existentialist terminology is employed frequently in the works of the noted interpreter of Tibetan Buddhism, Herbert Guenther. He writes, for instance, that in Buddhism, ... knowing himself not merely to be an object in time but to be temporality, man is called upon to make a choice as to authenticity or unauthenticity. In Buddhist terms, unauthenticity would be the disruption of unitary reality into the events of Sarp.sara and Nirvar:a .... 7 Further, each of the six types of sarp.saric existence is ... a fragmentation, positive or negative, we may say, and a dis-avowal of the unitary nature of man's existence. Stated otherwise, man's experience of himself as, say, a brute or a god, is a neglect of the transcendent in his total nature.8 A more recent\" existential approach to Buddhism\" is provided by Stephen Batchelor, in his Alone With Others, where he argues that the traditional \"two wings\" of the Mahayana path, wisdom (prajiiii) and method (upiiya) can be taken as providing\" authentic\" approaches to the two basic \"modes\" of being human, \"being-alone\" and \"being-with-others,\" the basic insight of wisdom being a recognition of entities' lack of permanence or substantiality, the basic practice of method being compassion and the perfections that embody it, i.e., generosity (diina), morality (sila), patience (k~iinti) and effort (virya). In the course of providing his existential analysis, Batchelor simply ig-nores such traditional Buddhist concerns as karma and rebirth, and insists that the Buddha must be understood not as a transcendent or in any way superhuman being, but as \"the man who walked through Northern India with a group of disciples, begged for food, gave clear and practical teachings, and finally died of dysentery,\"9 and is extraor-dinary simply because he is a paradigm of \"the optimum pOSSible mode of human life.\"lo 6 Ibid., 152-3.

None of the authors just cited is trying deliberately to misrepresent Buddhism; each is simply trying to explain it to a Western audience either unschooled in or skeptical of traditional Buddhist cosmology and metaphysics. There always is a danger, however, that explaining may become explaining-away, and that what begins innocently as an attempt to show that Buddhism may be more readily comprehended via this or that psychological description or existential analysis may end with the implication that what all Buddhists \"really\"have meant when asserting their traditional doctrines is just this or that psycho-lOgical description or existential analysis. The implication for truth-theory, then, is that the Buddha did not assert the four noble truths literally, but only figuratively, and that his criterion of truth was pragma-tism or coherence rather than correspondence. This interpretation of the Buddha undoubtedly makes him more attractive to contemporary people, and may help to clarify or make palatable such relatively alien notions as samsara and nirvana, but it must be remembered that if the virtue of expl~ining an alien tradition by recourse to \"matching con-cepts\" from our own culture is comprehensibility, its vice is the danger of serious distortion-misrepresenting what people in the alien tradi-tion actually have meant when they have made certain statements. What, in fact, have Buddhists meant by the assertion of the four noble truths? How literally have they intended their cosmology to be taken? From the examination of traditional Buddhist attitudes toward truth that follows, we will see that Buddhism probably can be asserted to have upheld corre-spondence as its main criterion, but that the tradition has a greater ambivalence toward truth than might at first seem the case. Indeed, the Buddhist appreciation of the paradoxes involved in truth-claims is as sophis-ticated in its own way as that of the Western tradition. We shall begin by examining a number of Buddhist sources that seem to point to correspondence as the main criterion of truth, then tum to texts that seem rather more prag-matic or coherentist in orientation. B. \"CORRESPONDENCE THEORY\"IN BUDDHISM The Buddha never overtly propounded a correspondence theory of truth-the term, after all, comes from the Western tradition. There are, however, many indications that he did adhere implicity to such a theory. Thus, in the Abhayarajakumara Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya, the Buddha discusses statements in terms of their (a) truth or falsity, (b) utility or use-10 Ibid., 129."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Truth in Buddhism 47 lessness and (c) pleasantness or unpleasantness. He maintains that he asserts as truths only those statements that are (a) true, useful and pleas-ant or (b) true, useful and unpleasantY The Buddha was concerned chiefly to teach a way to salvation, so it is not surprsing that he should have tended to emphasize those truths that had the greatest bearing on the attainment of this goal, i.e., \"useful\" or \"pragmatic\" truths. To teach pragmatic truths and to teach a pragmatic criterion ohruth, however, are different matters. As K.N. Jayatilleke puts it, \" ... the truths of Buddhism were considered to be pragmatic in the Buddhist sense of the term, but it does not mean that Early Buddhism believes in a pragmatist theory of truth.\"12 A pragmatist theory, as we have seen, may involve, in effect, the supposition that \"a belief istrue if it is useful and false.\"13 Although it is not mentioned specifically, Jayatilleke infers that a proposition that was useful but false would not have been asserted by the Buddha, because it was considered self-contradictory to say of a statement that it was false but useful .... Since falsehood or the assertion of a statement that is false (musiiviida) was considered a moral evil, it would have been held to be logically or causally impossible for what is false, i.e., what is morally evil, to result in what was useful in the sense of being morally advantageous or good ... 14 The Buddha, or Tathagata, repeatedly is described as one who sees and describes \"the truth,\"which may be satya, that which is \"real\" or\" actual\" (sat); tathatii, which is \"thusness\" or\" objectivity\"15 or bhUta, that which has \"happened\" or \"become.\"This, says Jayatilleke, \"tacitly implies the accep-tance of a correspondence theory of truth.\"16 The \"conscious avowal\" of the correspondence theory is found in the ApmpJaka Sutta of the Majjhima Nikiiya, where the Buddha makes it clear that falsity is non -conformity with 11 M, i,395; tr. Chalmers (1926-27) I, 282-85. See also D, ill, 135,sutta no. 29; tr. Rhys Davids and Rhys Davids (1951) III, 126-27. See also Jayatilleke (1980) 351-52. 12 Jayatilleke (1980) 358. 13 A.D. V\\bozley, quoted ibid. The IIfalsity,\"in such a case, of course, would only be from the poin view of one upholding the correspondence theory! 14 Jayatilleke (1980) 358, 359. A pragmatist might argue that there is an implicit circularity here, since the determination of what is \"objectively\" good may in fact be parasitic on assumptions about what is socially useful. 15 See Kalupahana (1976) esp. p. 93: \" ... causation is not merely an idea or thought-construction without any objective validity, but an idea that corre-sponds to what is found in nature\"(Le., nature is \"thus,\"tathii). 16 Ibid., 352."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"48 Is Enlightenment Possible? fact and truth conformity with fact. If, for example, one believes, conceives or asserts that there is no next world, when in fact there is a next world, then one's belief, conception or assertion is false. If one believes, conceives or as-serts that there is a next world, when in fact there is one, then one's belief, conception or assertion is true.17 Here, a clear distinction is made between belief, conception or assertion on the one hand, and actuality on the other, a distinction often ignored in the pragmatic theory of truth and rejected in coherence theory, and therefore truly meaningful only within the frame-work of a correspondence theory. This same distinction is made-and a correspondence theory thereby implied-in one of the most famous of all nikaya passages: \"Whether tathagatas arise or do not arise, this order (dhiitu) persists: the fixed nature of things, the way things are, conditional-ity.\"IS Thus, there exists a \"way things are,\" a reality that is independent of any perceptions or formulations of it. Tathagatas, after all, are virtually the only beings who have comprehended and explained things as they actually are, so the assertion that the reality they expound exists whether or not they are around to expound it is a quite unambiguous indication of an attitude to-ward truth that only can be characterized as correspondence theory. Further evidence of what counts as \"true\"in Buddhism may be pro-vided by a brief survey of the ideas considered false: the notion of \"wrong view\" (mithyiidr~ti, P. micchaditthi)19 shows a remarkable consistency throughout Buddhist history, Hinayana and Mahayana; Pali and San-skrit; Vaibha~ika, Sautrantika, Yogacara and Madhyamika. The basic formulation of wrong view is found in a number of different places in the nikiiyas, e.g., in the Mahiicattiirisaka Sutta of the Majjhima Nikiiya: What, 0 monks, is wrong view? [Saying] there are no alms, there is no sacrifice, there is no offering; there is no ripening of the fruit of karma that tends toward happiness or suffering; there is no \"this\"world, there is no other world; there is no mother, there is no father, there are no miraculously born be-ings; there are in this world no samanas or brii~manas who have reached the highest point, who live perfectly, and who, having themselves understood and experienced this world 17 M, i, 402-3; tr.

Why is that? Because they have not cognized these through perception, they have not attained a vision of them.22 Nearly a thousand years later, the great Tibetan philosopher, Tsong kha pa blo bzang grags pa (1357-1419), writes that wrong view (T.logpar ita ba) is essentially nihilism, and that such nihilism is fourfold: There is nihilism in relation to cause, effect, activity and what really exists. Nihilism in relation to cause is the claim that there are no good or evil actions. Nihilism in relation to effect is the claim that there is no fruit of these two. Of the three types of nihilism in relation to activity, ... [the second,] nihil-ism in relation to the activity of coming and going is the claim that there are no past or future lives .... Nihilism in relation to what really exists is the claim that there are no arhants, etc.23 Although it is not surprising that there exists such unanimity throughout the length and breadth of a single tradition-since funda-mental doctrinal formulas have a way of being encoded and repeated-it is important that so central a formula consistently has 20 M, iii, 71-72, in sutta no. 117; tr.

The Buddhist notion of \"right view\" (samyagdr~ti, P. sammaditthi) is simply the opposite of wrong view. Right view, thus, involves the belief that there are past and future lives, the causal mechanism of karma does function, there do exist arhants and other beings who have travelled a path and attained nirval).a. These beliefs, in turn, correspond closely to the assumptions that underlie the four noble truths. Right view, therefore, essentially comes to entail acceptance of the four noble truths and their cosmological and philosophical presuppositions as literally true. That the four noble truths are intended as \"propositions about states-of-affairs\"is evident not only from the degree to which they in-form Buddhist notions of right and wrong view, but also from later, detailed formulations of them in the abhidharma. In the Vaibhasika and other Sanskritic traditions, for example, the four noble truths are divided into sixteen\" aspects\" (akara), the direct realization of which transforms one from an ordinary being (prthagjana) into an arya, des-tined for enlightenment. A number of different arrangements of the sixteen aspects are found in Vasubandhu'sAbhidharmakosabha~ya. One of the most interesting of these, the fourth, explains each of the six-teen aspects in terms of the incorrect philosophical view to which it is an antidote: 1. The truth of suffering: The fact that suffering is impermanent (anitya) counters the view that it is permanent. The fact that it is suf-fering (du~kha) counters the view that it is happiness. The fact that suffering is void (sfmya) counters the view that it pertains to a self. The fact that suffering is non-self (anatmaka) counters the view that it has a substantial self. 2. The truth of origination: The fact that suffering has a cause (hetu) counters the view that it has no cause. The fact that suffering is origi-nated (samudaya) by a complex of causes counters the view that it has a single cause, such as God (isvara). The fact that suffering is succes-sively produced (prabhava) counters the view that it is merely the transformation of some pre-existent cause, such as the \"nature\" (Prakrti) posited by Sarp.khyas. The fact that suffering is variously con-ditioned (pratyaya) counters the view that suffering is brought about by some intelligent being. 3. The truth of cessation: The fact of cessation (nirodha) counters the view that there is no liberation from suffering. The fact that cessation is peaceful (santa) counters the view that liberation is suffering.

The fact that the path accomplishes (pratipad) the goal counters the view that there is an-other path one might follow. The fact that the path leads to a definite removal (nairyiinika) of suffering counters the view that one on the path is subject to relapse.24 It is obvious even from this skeletal summary that, in asserting the sixteen aspects of the four noble truths a Buddhist is, at the same time, contradicting a number of views central to other schools of Indian phi-losophy' e.g., the iitmaviida of most orthodox (iistika) schools, the II transformation theory\" (pariIJiimaviida) of the SaITtkhyas, the random causal theory of some materialists, the theism of Naiyayikas and the soteriological skepticism of materialists and many MimaITtsakas. The refutation of others'views and the assertion of one's own is not, pre-sumably, something undertaken idly. One pursues such discussions because one believes that one's own assertions II correspond\" to the way things really are, whereas the assertions of one's opponents are false, misleading and spiritually damaging. From the very first sutta of the Dlgha Nikiiya,25 the Brahmajiila, which refutes sixty-two mistaken views, down to the late \"logicians,\" such as Dharmakirti and San-tarak~ita, Buddhists have been concerned to promote their own views and refute those of others; this in itself is further evidence for the \"hardness\" of Buddhist truth-claims, and of correspondence as the way in which those truth-claims are made. A final, crucial piece of evidence that Buddhists have asserted the four noble truths as literally true statements corresponding to actual states-of-affairs is found in the Dlgha Nikiiya, where the Buddha dis-tinguishes statements that can be made categorically from those that cannot be made categorically. Among the statements that cannot be asserted categorically are the famous \"unanswered\" (avyakrta, P. avyakata) metaphysical questions about the duration and extension of 24 Poussin (1923-31) VII, 38-39. The relevant verse is AK vii, 13a. For a further discussion of the sixteen aspects, particularly as analyzed by Asanga and Tsang kha pa, see Wayman (1980).

Among those that can be asserted categorically are the four noble truths.26 The Pali term that has been translated as \"categorical,\" ekarrzsika, literally means\" one-sided, one-edged,\" and thus, in this context, admitting of only one interpretation, unequivocal, unambiguous. Therefore, when the four noble truths are asserted, they are asserted directly and unambigu-ously. There is no sense in which their truth could be merely relative or provisional. They correspond to reality whether or not a buddha ap-pears to assert them, and the cosmological and philosophical assumptions behind them must equally be regarded as true. Thus, however modern Buddhists may choose to interpret the terms, most tra-. ditional Buddhists seem to have believed that statements regarding saI!lsara and nirval).a are true in the most literal sense, as a wheel of rebirths powered by deluded actions and the utter stopping of that wheel through the extraordinary meditative practices of the Buddhist path. There is, thus, considerable evidence that when the Buddha preached the four noble truths to his ascetic friends at Sarnath, he meant exactly what he said. The evidence of the tradition as a whole, however, is not entirely unambiguous, for there are many passages in Buddhist texts, both Hinayana and Mahayana, that might be adduced to qualify a categorical insistence that the Buddhist criterion of truth is correspondence, pure and simple. C. BUDDHIST PRAGMATISM We already have seen that the Buddha of the nikayalagama tradition con-sidered \"usefulness\" nearly as important a characteristic of true statements as their veracity, and there is, indeed, a strong pragmatic thrust in much of the Buddhist tradition-to the point where we may oc-caSionally wonder if Walter Kaufmann was not correct in his remark that Buddhism is essentially \"unphilosophical,\"because its primary focus is on salvation rather than truth, and \"knowledge and understanding are ... mere instruments for the attainment of an experience.\"27 As noted, the Buddha simply refused to answer certain metaphysical questions about the limits of the universe or the condition of a tathagata after death, on the grounds that any answer was fraught with philosophical pitfalls, and the perplexity resulting from confronting such dilemmas did nothing to ad-vance the questioner spiritually.28 The Buddha also taught a number of 26 D, i, 191, in sutta no. 9, the Potthapiida; tr.

The \"arrow\" parable, in which it is suggested that a man shot by an arrow must seek medical treatment rather than inquiring as to the particulars of the arrow and bowman, indicates that we who suffer in samsara should be more concerned with leaving it than with an endless a'nalysis of its workings.29 The \"raft\" parable compares the Dharma to a raft, and suggests that just as a raft is left behind once we have successfully crossed a river, so the Dharma no longer is necessary when one has reached its goal, nirvfu:1.a.30 The parable of the raft, in particular, can be given an interpretation that is not only pragmatic, but pragmatist: it may be taken to imply that the con-tents of the Buddha's Dharma, including the four noble truths, are taught primarily with their utility, not their truth, in mind, and that they may be dispensed with once one has attained the goal to which an understanding of them conduces. Perhaps, then, they do not really\" correspond to states-of-affairs,\" but are, rather, simply convenient fictions, to be used or discarded entirely on the basis of expediency. This interpretation is tempt-ing, but not, I think, ultimately plausible. We must bear in mind Jayatilleke's insistence above that the Buddha would not have promulgated teachings that were useful but false-since mendacity by definition could not be beneficial, and utility only could be assigned to a statement that was true, i.e., that described things as they actually are. Thus, the fact that the \"raft of Dharma\" can be left behind by those who have attained the\" other shore\" of nirvar:ta does not mean that it thereby is falsified; it remains true, but it no longer is useful, since its usefulness is restricted to those who have not yet reached the other shore. Similarly, the fact that the metaphysical and other speculations with which we concern ourselves much of the time \"do not tend to edification\" does not mean that no truths or knowledge have any importance. It simply means that we should concern ourselves with those truths that bear most directly on our situation in the cosmos. Thus, we should not, perhaps, concern ourselves excessively with \"factual\"knowl-edge about details of the world; but we should be most concerned with the crucial details of the way in which s~sara is perpetuated or discontinued. There is information about such matters, in propositions like the four noble truths, and they, in tum, only will be worth exploring if they are true de-scriptions of how things really are in the cosmos. 28 For a lucid discussion of the unanswered questions, see Jayatilleke J1980) pas-sim. 29 M, i, 429, in sutta no. 63, the Cillamalunkhya; tr.

If the pragmatism of the Hinayana tradition turns out to be less subversive of a correspondence criterion of truth than might at first appear the case, matters are less clear when we turn to the literature of the Mahayana. Here, the malleable concept of the Buddha's skill-in-means (upayakausalya) is invoked either directly or implicitly to explain both inconsistencies among the Buddha's teachings and ap-parent breaches of traditional morality by buddhas or bodhisattvas: any act or statement that is conducive to the spiritual welfare of oth-ers' even if apparently immoral or false, is an example of skill-in-means, motivated by compassion and guided by wisdom, and is not, in fact, immoral or false. The locus classicus for raising the issue of skill-in-means on the moral level is the famous \"burning house\" parable of the Lotus (Saddhannapu1Jqarika) Siltra, recounted by the Buddha for Sariputra. A wise father (the Buddha) sees that the house (samsara) in which his children (sentient beings) are playing is on fire (~ith suffering). He also perceives that they do not realize this (because of ignorance) and must be saved. Rather than panic them with a cry of alarm, he calmly lures them outside, promising to each the sort of animal-cart he most desires (the sravakaycma, pratyekabuddhayana or bodhisattvayana). Ex-cited, the children rush out of the house (enter the path). They discover that their father actually has but one type of cart to offer (the one vehicle, ekayana, which is the bodhisattvayana), and has advertised three because he knows that different promises will lure out different children, depending on their dispositions. Having recounted the par-able, the Buddha asks Sariputra whether the father, promising three types of carts but delivering only one, was a liar. No, Sariputra replies, he was not, because his \"lie\"had the effect of inducing the children to leave the burning house; a \"white lie\" such as this is no lie at all. 31 Here, it seems, truth really has been cut loose from factuality. Truth is not a matter of propositions about states-of-affairs, but something \"situational\": the true statement in a given circumstance is that which is most beneficial spiritually for the person to whom the statement is directed. In a very literal sense, the Buddha becomes a teller of great \"stories,\"in the manner suggested above by Hare and Braithwaite. This apparently pragmatist approach to truth receives a more sys-tematic basis with the development of the Mahayana hermeneutical practice of distinguishing between scriptures of definitive meaning (nitartha) and those whose meaning requires further interpretation 31 SF, 53; tr. Kern (1963) 75-76."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Truth in Buddhism 55 (neyartha). The distinction is introduced in the Sa1?1dhinirmocana Sidra, which is roughly contemporaneous with the Lotus. The seventh chap-ter of the Sa1?1dhinirmocana describes \"three turnings of the wheel of Dharma,\"whose contents, respectively, were the Hinayana, Madhyamika and Yogacara teachings. The Hinayana teachings (including the four noble truths), because of their ontological \"realism,\" were conducive to misunderstanding, and therefore required further explanation (neyiirtha); the Perfection of Wisdom (prajfiaparamita) and Mad-· hyamika teachings were similarly in need of interpretation (neyartha) because of their apparent nihilism. Only the Yogacara teachings, be-cause of their clear discrimination between what \"really\" exists (the \"absolute,\" parini~panna, nature of phenomena) and what does not exist (the \"imagined,\" parikalpita, nature), is unambiguous and defini-tive (nitiirtha), requiring no further interpretation.32 Different schools, of course, have differed on which of the Buddha's teachings are defini-tive and which interpretable, but that some such type of distinction is valid has been assumed by virtually all subsequent Buddhist think-ers33-after all, despite its possible circularity and trans-sectarian inconclusiveness, such a hermeneutical principle does give a Buddhist philosopher a way of resolving apparent contradictions in the Bud-dha's teaching, and of organizing the massive accumulation of received tradition. For our immediate purposes, the principle's most important trait is that it grants at least provisional truth-status to a vast number of teachings that are, at least from an ultimate perspec-tive, false. Because the \"lower\" teachings are spiritually beneficial for those to whom they are addressed, they are, in their way, true. Their truth, however-much like the Lotus father's promise of three animal-carts-only is a function of their utility, and the criterion of truth that seems to be invoked is a pragmatic one. D. COHERENCE AND INCOHERENCE: HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF NOTHING If truth as correspondence is undermined by these ethical and herme-neutical applications of Mahayana \"method\" (upiiya), then it seems utterly to be shattered when we turn to the literature of the Mahayana \"wisdom\" (prajl1ii) tradition, as exemplified by the Perfection of Wisdom 32 Lamotte (1935) chapter 7. 33 The Indo-Tibetan tradition has retained the nitarthalneyartha distinction; the equivalent in the Sino-Japanese tradition is the p'an chiao system of ranking teachings from most elementary to most advanced."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"56 Is Enlightenment Possible? sutras and the Madhyamika and Yogacara schools of philosophy. Thus, we read in the Perfection of Wisdom sutra generally conceded to be the oldest, the Astasiihasrikii, that both buddhahood and nirvana are like an illusion~·or a dream, i.e., that they are \"unreal.\"34 In a si~i­lar vein, the most famous Perfection of Wisdom text, the Heart Sidra (Prajiiiipiiramitiihrdaya), proclaims that \"there is no suffering, origina-tion, cessation or path, no gnosis, no attainment ... \"35 This sort of negative rhetoric suffuses the Perfection of Wisdom literature, as it does the major philosophical works of Nagarjuna (second century C.E. ?), founder of the Madhyamaka. Nagarjuna writes, for instance, that \"As an illusion, as a dream, as a celestial city: thus has generation, thus has du-ration, thus has destruction been characterized,,,36 that \"nirvana is non-existent,,37 and that\" nirvana is not in the least distinct from sarp.sara.,,38 If the dialectic of the Madhyamika is aimed primarily at dem-onstrating the utter vacuity (or \"voidness,\" or \"emptiness\": sunyatii) of all entities and concepts, including those truths solemnly asserted by earlier Buddhist traditions, then discussion in the Yogacara centers on rejecting the existence of any \"world\" external to perceptions of it, and asserting that the \"world\"is, in fact, simply a mental construction. In the words of the LaJikavatiira Siltm, External objects are not admitted; the triple world is taught as not being anything but the Mind [citta] itself; multiplicities of external existences are not accepted; there is no rising of the elements, nor their disappearence, nor their continuation, nor their differentiation.39 The implication of this sort of rhetoric for truth-theorywould seem to be, quite simply, that there are no objective truths. All truth-claims are ulti-mately unwarranted, because the \"real\" entities that are supposed to \"correspond\" to the entities described in truth-statements turn out, on closer analysis, to be either non-self-sufficient, hence ontologicallyvacuous (sunya); or mere mental constructs (vijnaptimiitra, cittamiitra), beyond which there is no extrinsic object.

The latter view, which holds that a critique of ontological self-suffi-ciency or epistemic objectivity entails nothing short of nihilism, is put forward by Nagarjuna's hypothetical opponent at the beginning of the twenty-fourth chapter of the Madhyamakakiirikii: \"If everything is void,\" he maintains, \"then there will be neither generation nor de-struction, and it follows that the four noble truths are non-existent,,40 furthermore, \"through voidness [sunyatii], the true existence of re-sults, right and wrong, and all conventional and worldly [knowledge] is undermined.,,41 A nihilistic interpretation of the concept of voidness (or of mind-only) is not, by any means, merely a hypothetical possibil-ity; it consistently was adopted by Buddhism's opponents wherever the religion spread, nor have Buddhists themselves been immune to it, as two examples from the history of the Tibetan tradition will illustrate. In the first instance, an apparently nihilistic view was propounded by the Chinese Ch'an master Ho-shang Mo-ho-yen (T. Hva shang Mahayana), who debated doctrinal matters with a number of Indian pandits at the court of the Tibetan king Khri srong Ide btsan, late in the eighth century C.E. Mo-ho-yen propounded an instantaneous path to enlightenment through the elimination of all discursive thought, while the Indians (led by the great acarya Kamalasila) were concerned to preserve the integrity of the traditional sequence of practices, in which wisdom was founded on morality, analysis and concentration. Mo-ho-yen believed that the truth was verbally incommunicable and he was reluctant to debate, claiming that he preferred silence. Com-pelled nevertheless to debate, he consistently cited scriptural passages that seemed to show that truth had nothing to do with propositions and everything to do with an unmediated insight into reality, and, consequently, that conventional analysis and practices were both ir-relevant and spiritually harmfu1.42 Whether Mo-ho-yen really rejected 40 MMK. xxiv; 1; tr.

Later in the Tibetan tradition, the founder of the dGe lugs school, Tsong kha pa, assails as nihilists unidentified philosophical oppo-nents, who appear to assert that such passages as the Heart Siara's denial of the four noble truths are to be taken at face value: conven-tional entities simply do not exist, so all conventional truth-claims must be false. Similarly, Nagarjuna's statement, \"If I set forth any proposition, then I would be in error; I I do not set forth any proposi-tion' so I am not in error,,,43 is taken to mean that no propositions whatever are to be entertained. Taken literally, these statements ap-pear to rule out cosmology, logic and virtually any sort of philosophical analysis, not to mention various conventional path practices. What, if anything, they permit is not clear-though their pro-ponents may have intended, by denying the conventional, radically to open the way to the ultimate-presupposing that the two truths, rather than reinforcing each other, are radically opposed.44 In order to obviate nihilism such as this, mainstream Mahayanists have explained their own negative rhetoric by appealing to the notion that there are, in fact, two types of truth (satyadvaya), conventional or \"mun-dane superficial\" (lokasa1?1vrti) truths, and ultimate truths that are true in the \"highest sense\" (paramartha).

See Bhattacharya (1978) 1st part, 23 and 2nd part, 29; and Streng (1967) 224. 44 Tsong kha pa's discussion is found in, e.g., the lhag mthong (\"insight,\" vipas-yana) section of his Lam rim chen mo and in the Drang nges legs bshed snyingpo. On the former, see Napper {1989)i for a translation of the latter, see Thurman (1984). It is conceivable that Tsong kha pa's unidentified opponent is a Jo nang pa, an upholder of the doctrine of \"voidness of the other\" (T. gzhan stong), whereby the ultimate truth is what remains when the conventional is re-moved-if not necessarily negated in the way that Tsong kha pa asserts. On gzhan stong, see Hookham (1991)."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Truth in Buddhism. 59 The buddhas' teaching of the Dharma is based on two truths, mundane superficial truth and truth in the highest sense. Those who do not know the difference between those two truths do not know the profound principle of the Buddha's t h· 45 eac mg. This distinction between two levels of truth became as fundamental to Mahayana philosophical discussion as the distinction between definitive and interpretable scriptures did to Buddhist hermeneutics (indeed, they are closely related, since definitive scriptures are generally held to teach ulti-mate truths and interpretable scriptures teach conventional truths). Thus, for either a Madhyarnika or a Yogacara,46 the assertion of such notions as the four noble truths, production and destruction, and s~sara and nirvfu:ta, is conventionally valid. From an ultimate point of view, however, such \"facts\" lack self-sufficiency or objectivity; they are merely void and/or mentally constructed. The ultimate truth for a Madhyarnika is, simply, voidness (which is itself void); for a Yogacara it is mind-only (which mayor may not itself be mind-only). Nagarjuna is quite emphatiC in his subsequent insistence that each of the two truths must be balanced, that both are necessary on the Buddhist path: \"Without reliance on the conventional, the ultimate is not taught; without approach to the ultimate, nirva:r:a is not at-tained.,,47 Thus, the assertion of voidness is not the negation of either the Buddhist path or conventional reality, for voidness is a different type of truth, a meta-truth that describes the ultimate mode of exist-ence of all entities asserted by conventional truth-claims. It does not nullify the conventional truth of conventional entities; it merely af-firms that in an ultimate sense all conventional phenomena and statements lack self-sufficiency, i.e., they arise depending either on other entities, subjective imputation, or both. Thus, conventional truths like the four noble truths may be \"ultimately\" false but literally true, since their ultimate falsity reflects not their lack of correspon-dence to states-of-affairs but, simply, their lack of ontological self-sufficiency. Not only is voidness not a negation of the conven-tional-it actually is the only principle by which the conventional can be understood to work. If phenomena are self-sufficient or \"self-exis-45 MMK xxiv, 8-9; tr. Inada (1970) 146; Streng (1967) 213. 46 Rather than two truths, Yogacara actually analyzes reality into \"three natures\" (tr\"isvabhava), the dependent (paratantra), the imaginary (parikaZpita) and the absolute (parini~panna), but the concepts are functionally quite similar. 47 MMK xxiv, 10; tr. Inada (1970) 146; Streng (1967) 213."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"60 Is Enlightenment Possible? tent\" (svabhava), they must be unchanging and independent; if they are unchanging and independent, nothing can \"work\"in the way that it actually does. It is only because phenomena are impermanent and interdependent-void of self-existence-that the processes of the world can occur as we know them to.48 Thus, the fundamental mistake made by Mo-ho-yen and Tsong kha pa's unnamed opponents is to ignore the importance of both of the two truths, and to subordinate the conventional utterly to the ulti-mate. To do this is, in fact, to leave oneself with a \"one-truth\" rather than a \"two-truth\"theory. Statements in the Mahayana wisdom-tradi-tion that appear to negate the conventional thus must be interpreted carefully. When, for instance, the Heart Sidra insists that \"there is no cessation\" (i.e., nirvaI!a), it does not mean that in a conventional sense none of us ever will attain the cessation of suffering. After all, the very next sentence of the siitra insists that bodhisattvas who \"rely upon the perfection of wisdom\"will\"in the end attain nirvaI!a.\"49 Thus, the \"ne-gation\" of cessation merely implies that when subjected to an ultimate analysis the concept of \"cessation\" cannot be found to exist inde-pendently of, for example, the concept of \"suffering\" or the mind that conceives\" cessation.,,50 Similarly, Nagarjuna's statement to the effect that he makes no propositions would, if taken literally, be self-contra-dictory; it is more likely that what he actually means is that he can make no assertions about entities or concepts taken as ontologically self-sufficient-the way in which, he would maintain, most of us take entities or concepts to exist-since no such self-existent entities or concepts exist to be the subject of propositions.51 Indeed, the only way in which the \"paradoxes\" of Mahayana (or other Asian) wisdom-literature can be understood is against the back-ground of a two-truth theory-unless, that is, we assume that Mahayanists actually are content to entertain contradictory theses (if they were, then Mahayana critiques of opposing viewpoints, which presuppose the meaningfulness of contradiction, would themselves be meaningless).

It is very important to note that \"true\" and \"false\"have different usages from perspective to perspective. Thus, truth and falsity in the ultimate sense depend on the presence or absence of ontological self-sufficiency or epistemic objectivity. The four noble truths lack such a mode of existence, and so \"ultimately\" are false. Their truth from a conventional perspective is not, however the opposite of their ultimate falsity: they do not have \"conventional\" ontological self-sufficiency. Conventionally, truth and falsity depend on correspondence to states-of-affairs, and conventionally the four noble truths do reflect the way things are, so they are \"true.\" We still may be tempted, however, to infer that the ultimate per-spective does relativize conventional truths radically, thereby making them true at best in the weaker sense entailed by a pragmatic or co-herence criterion of truth. This temptation may perhaps be curbed if we view the levels of discourse in a Mahayana text as a set of Chinese boxes. The innermost box in a given text may insist on the reality of, say, the four noble truths; around that, then, will be a box that negates those same truths from the ultimate perspective, apparently denying or relativizing them. There is, however, a box outside even the \"ulti-mate\"box, and that is the box that represents the composition of the work itself. If we accept as axiomatic that Buddhist works are written for the purpose of assisting their readers to attain enlightenment, then we see that the \"real\"perspective from which such \"anti-correspon-dent\" doctrines as skill-in -means, voidness and mind -only are offered is a perspective that centers on salvation, hence, at the very minimum, on the assumption that there is a fundamental set of problems that human beings share, and that there exists a potential solution to that set of problems. It may be that the \"solution\" is to be arrived at through disabusing oneself of the idea that problems and solutions exist self-sufficiently or independent of a problem-solving conscious-ness, but the problem-solution framework remains the sine qua non of the entire \"spiritual\" exercise, and those who pose the problems and solutions, therefore, must be assumed to be quite serious in their en-terprise. They must believe, in effect, that the problems and solutions they pose are meaningful and real-whether or not they withstand the sort of ultimate philosophical analysis favored by the tradition. The \"problem\" with which all traditional Buddhists begin, of course, is saf!lsara, and the\" solution\" nirval)a, and to the degree that any Bud-dhist-whatever their subsequent rhetoric-must take these seriously if they are to write a Buddhist work, we can say that for all practical purposes saf!lsara and nirval)a must be assumed to be \"the way things"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"62 Is Enlightenment Possible? really are,\" and thus in some meaningful way to \"correspond\" to actual states-of-affairs. Thus, just as those Western philosophical arguments that purport to overturn the correspondence theory of truth still must presuppose it in some way, so, too, Buddhist texts and traditions that seem to overturn all conventional notions of a \"real\" or objective world still assume that there is a \"way things are\" -broadly divisible into \"sal!lsara\" and \"nirvar:ta\"-that makes the whole enterprise of criticizing \"objective reality\" meaningful. To that degree, objective reality may be negated from a particular analytical perspective, but as a construct without which human activity would be virtually impossible, it is upheld-and with it, correspondence as the \"real\" criterion of truth for Buddhists, even those who might deny that this is their criterion. Therefore, each of the foregoing candidates for a \"pragmatic\" or\" coher-ence\" theory of truth rests on the assumption that the bifurcation of the cosmos into sal!lSara and nirvar:ta, spelled out in the four noble truths, is the real state-of-affairs from which inquiry begins. The concept of ethical skill-in-means, thus, may \"pragmatically\" loosen the connection between morality and external behavior, or between truth and factuality, but skill-in-means only are applied as a spiritual expedient against the background assumption that sal!lsara and nirvii.r:ta are the two options\" really\" open to beings. The distinction between direct and interpretable teachings may re-lativize many traditional Buddhist truth-statements by describing them as \"merely\" pragmatic. But even \"definitive\" teachings are \"merely\" prag-matic, since they are \"definitive\" only to the degree that they are the most crucial principles to be understood in one's movement from 5al!lsara to nirvii.r:ta-whose reality is, again, the truly definitive ground for the compo-sition and interpretation of texts. The negative rhetoric of the Perfection of Wisdom and Madhyamaka, the \"idealism\" of Yogacara, and the\" absurdity\" of Zen may all appear to establish the four noble truths as true only to the degree that they are coherent with some limited conceptual scheme (called \"elaboration,\" prapaiica, in Madhyamaka, and \"imputation,\" vikalpa, in Yogacara), but we must recall that the \"falsity\" of the four noble truths ac-cording to these systems is very much relative to a particular philosophical perspective that is pursued only because it is assumed to be \"useful\"in pro-moting our movement from sal!lsara to nirvii.r:ta, which, regardless of whether they ultimately are \"void\" or\" mind -only,\" do correspond to states-of-affairs. Thus, even though such particulars of Buddhist cosmology as past and future lives, the \"law\" of karma, or the procedures of the Buddhist path may be \"void\" or \"mind-only,\" their \"reality\" in the convt:ntional, \"correspondent\"sense of the term is not compromised.

What Buddhists Claim Is True We have seen that in the Buddhist philosophical tradition, as in that of the West, the question of what it means for a statement to be true is a complex one, and that Buddhists-particularly Mahayanists-have been as cognizant as their Western counterparts that many of the conventions that we consider true must be qualified by the recognition that in some ultimate sense they cannot be found to be realities independent of other entities and/or some conceptual scheme. At the same time, the relativi-zation of conventional truths by an ultimate perspective does not make those truths less real from a conventional viewpoint, which still depends on the idea that our truth-claims must in some way correspond to a \"real world\" -whatever its ultimate nature-if they are to be meaningful. What, then, do Buddhists claim is the case? What is the \"state-of-affairs\" that the Dharma describes? We already have discussed the four noble truths as the \"cornerstones\" of the Buddhist world -view, and indicated at least generally the presuppositions that they appear to entail. In this sec-tion, we will examine in somewhat greater detail the sort of cosmology and soteriology that these truths involve, taking care to distinguish vari-ations within the tradition. This, in turn, will provide us with the basic set of propositions whose truth-status Buddhists have debated over the cen-turies, among themselves, and with their non-Buddhist opponents. A. SAM sARA AND NIRVANA . . The proposition that is in some ways the most fundamental of all to Bud-dhists is that which we uncovered toward the end of the previous section, i.e., the claim that the fundamental structure of the cosmos is twofold, di-visible into samsara and nirvana. Samsara, in its broadest sense, is the unsatisfactory or \"suffering\" cy~le of existence that is the lot of sentient beings still under the control of deluded actions. Nirvfu).a, in its broadest sense, is the state or condition, attainable via a spiritual path, that is the cessation of sa.I!lsara. The degree to which this proposition is fundamen-tal to Buddhism is illustrated by the fact that, before he had enunciated a single item of what would become his Dharma, the Buddha framed his very quest for enlightenment by setting sarp.sara-especially the prospect of endless rebirth-as the \"problem\"he sought to solve, and nirvar;ta as"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"66 Is Enlightenment Possible? the hypothetical\" solution.\"l In taking sarpsara and nirval).a as the axes of his cosmology, the Buddha was neither unique nor original; by the time he arrived on the Indian scene,2 it was commonly (though by no means universally) assumed that sentient existence was characterized by a mi-gration from body to body, whose end was devoutly to be wished and earnestly to be sought. On the evidence of the Vedas, the concepts of sarpsara and nirv~a were not a part of the world-view brought to India by the Arya invaders of the second rnillenium B.C.E.; indeed, their relig-ion centered primarily on pleasing the gods, devas, so that life could be long, productive and prosperous, while their eschatology was hazy at best, centering on the expectation of going after death either to the blessed \"world of the fathers\" or the tenebrous \"house of clay.\" Such classical Indian concepts as reincarnation, karma and libera-tion (mok~a) and such practices as yoga and meditation (bhavanii) developed only slowly, for complex reasons that may be rooted in the disquieting social changes afflicting the eastern Gangetic area from early in the first millenium B.C.E. onward. These changes included the unhappy absorption of many formerly independent \"tribes\" of Aryas into great imperial states such as Magadha and Kosala; the growth of new economic classes who felt excluded by the brahmanical rituals that had become the center of religious life; and ongoing contacts with people and ideas, outside the Arya fold, that may have suggested al-ternative world-views and life-styles. Whateverthe reasons, we see in the later BraJ:1.mal).as and the early Upani~ads a gradual restatement of India's cosmology and religious agenda. The cosmos increasingly is viewed as a cycle of more or less unsatisfactory rebirths (sarpsara) that is fueled by deluded actions, karmas. The highest goal of sentient striving is seen as release from that cycle (mok~a, or nirval).a), a condition of eter-nal and imperishable bliss to be won-most commonly-through the direct realization of some vital metaphysical principle. 3 Delineations of the particulars of sarpsara and nirval).a and the way one perpetuated the former or reached the latter quite naturally var-1 See especially the various suttas in which some semblance of a biography is given by the Buddha, such as Ariyapariyesana Sutta, Mahapadiina Suttanta and Catusparisat Sutta of the Majjhima Nikiiya. 2 The dates for the Buddha commonly accepted by scholars are 563-483 B.C.E., although these are based on an arguable set of inferences from later Asokan inscriptions and Sinhalese texts. 3 For clear accounts of this crucial period of Indian history, see, e.g., Basham (1959) chapters II and III; Lamotte (1958); Jayatilleke (1980); and Campbell (1962) esp. 183-84."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Mat Buddhists Claim Is True 67 ied. The early Upani~ads, for instance, begin to articulate what became a classic Hindu view, namely that saJ.!lsara is perpetuated by our igno-rance of the fact that we have within us an imperishable principle, atman, that is identical with the immutable ground of the cosmos, brahman, and that only a profound realization of this fact will free us from the vicissitudes of the delusively multiple world in which we have lost ourselves. The group that would come to be known as the Jainas insisted that the suffering and rebirth of the soul (jiva) were due primarily to its obscuration by karma, and that if karmas were \"shed\" through austerities and abstinence from thought and action, the soul once again would shine purely, ascending to the peak of the cosmos to reside in perpetual bliss. There were many other groups, both ortho-dox (braI:tmal!-a, or iistika: proto-Hindu) and heterodox (§ramal!-a, or niistika), including the Ajivikas (of whom Upaka, who first doubted the Buddha, was a member), materialists and various yogins of the sort Siddhartha Gautama studied under before he became a buddha. Most of these groups embraced the saJ.!lsara-nirval!-a cosmology, a few rejected it, but all had in one way or other to respond to it, much as medieval Christian mystics had to respond to theological notions of the relation between God and humanity, and as people in the contem-porary world must respond to the world-view stated or implied by science. Thus, given the cultural and religious background into which the Buddha was born, it hardly can surprise us that he framed his search in terms of the saJ.!lsara-nirval!-a cosmology-taken quite literally as the belief in a cycle of rebirths and the prospect of attaining an eter-nally blissful release from that cycle.4 Thus, the problem for the Buddha, as for so many of his contemporaries, was to discover the \"keys\" to saJ.!lsara and nirval!-a, and this, clearly, he believed he had done-if tradition be accepted-while sitting under the bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya. The \"keys\" to saJ.!lsara and nirval!-a, in turn, may be formu-1ated as the four noble truths: the nature of saJ.!lsara is described by the truth of suffering, its causes by the truth of origination; the nature of nirval!-a is described by the truth of cessation, its causes by the truth of path. Let us, then, examine the particulars of these four great truth-claims. 4 As Jayatilleke notes (1980: 371), \"The conception of salvation from is intimately connected in Buddhism with the belief in rebirth. It is therefore an integral part of Early Buddhist belief and much of Buddhism would be unintelligible without it.\""},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"68 Is Enlightenment Possible? B. THE TRUTH OF SUFFERING The truth of suffering involves the claim that all saf!lsaric existence is either implicitly or explicitly unsatisfactory. Birth, sickness, aging, dying, separation from the pleasant, encounter with the unpleasant and not get-ting what one wants all entail suffering, either physical, mental, or both. This suffering is to be found not only in the human realm, but in the other five realms (gati) of saf!lsara, too: hell-beings suffer from extremes of heat or cold; \"hungry ghosts\"Cpretas) suffer from thirst, hunger and excruciat-ing forms of indigestion; animals suffer from fear, stupidity and slavery; and even the gods of the two \"highest\"realms (devas and asuras), though possessed of longevity, power and pleasure far beyond that of humans, are too absorbed in pleasure to concern themselves with the Dharma, and die miserable, uncontrolled deaths that often are followed by rebirth in a lower realm.s Thus, \"suffering\"involves not only the obvious physical or mental pain that all of us experience at one time or another, but also what we would call \"pleasure,\"which Buddhists refer to as \"suffering of change,\" since pleasure is transient, and sooner or later will be replaced by neutral or painful sensations. Injhe broadest sense, according to Bud-dhists' suffering pervades any being that has uncontrollably appropriated the five6 aggregates (skandhas) that form what we usually call a \"person\": form or matter (rUpa), sensation (vedanii), conception or recognition (samjiiii), dispositions or \"formations\"(sa1!lskiira) and cognition (vijiiiina). Buddhists at different places and times obviously have varied in their degree of concern with the \"problem\" of rebirth. It is, for in-stance, emphasized little in the \"this-worldly\" perspective of Zen, while being fundamental to the fully articulated forms of most Tibetan traditions. At the same time, until very recently it has stood at least in the background of virtually all Buddhist traditions, both Hinayana and Mahayana. Pre-modern Buddhists certainly recognized that the six realms could be seen as symbolic, say, of human psychological states, but there is no real evidence that any of them took the realms as merely sym-bolic, i.e., as only denoting psychological states. 5 The deva realm, in tum, is subdivided into types of gods inhabiting the desire realm (kamadhatu), in which the other five realms are entirely situated, the fonn realm (rupadhatu) and the formless realm (arupyadhatu). The latter two are the rebirths that ensue for those who die having achieved one of the four \"fonnl/and four \"fonnless\"meditative absorptions (dhyanas) accepted by Bud-dhists as attainable by Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike. 6 Four in the formless realm, where there is no matter (rupa)."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Mat Buddhists Claim Is True 69 To the degree that they believed in the six realms in a literal sense, Buddhists have, perforce, believed in past and future lives, i.e., in re-birth. To the degree that they have believed in rebirth, in turn, they have accepted that some aspect of the \"mind\"(which comprises all ag-gregates but form) must be independent of particular bodies, hence that some form of mind-body dualism must be the case.7To the degree that the realms of saI!1sara-even when they appear to be pleasur-able-are seen to be suffering, Buddhists have presupposed that there exists a supreme pleasure that does not decay-since it is only in com-parison to such a notion of pleasure that transient worldly pleasures can be defined as \"suffering.\" C. THE TRUTH OF ORIGINATION The truth of origination describes the causes of the suffering that per-vades saI!1sara. The cause of suffering is conventionally asserted to be craving, or \"thirst\"(tr~':la), those compulsions for sense-pleasure, the an-nihilation of pain, and existence that drive us from rebirth to rebirth. More precisely, we are impelled by defilements (klesa) and actions (kanna). Actions, whether of body, speech or mind, \"plant\"in the mental continuum \"seeds\"that will bear \"fruit\"in the future as the events and circumstances of this life and future lives. Since results are commensurate with the actions that \"seed\"them, and since the vast majority of sentient actions spring from defilement, from such basic fQrces as attachment, aversion and ignorance-it stands to reason that the majority of results are unpleasant, whether in this life or the next. Although craving may be the defilement that propels the wheel of saI!1sara, the \"root\" defilement generally is seen by Buddhists after the earliest period to be ignorance (avidya), which is, on the one hand, an ignorance of the way in which cause-and-effect functions morally through the \"law\" of karma, but which is, most importantly, the ignorant grasping after an immutable, in-dependent self (atman), the philosophical or instinctive sense of \"I.\"s 7 There has been considerable disagreement among Buddhists over just what it is that transmigrates, or takes rebirth; it is sufficient for our purposes to note that it is not an immutable soul, like the Hindu atman or the Jaina ;iva, and is some aspect of a being's mental makeup, e.g., its cognition aggregate (perhaps the most com-monview). 8 It has been suggested that the dual identification of origination with craving and ignorance reflects a basic ambivalence in the early Buddhist movement, where some monks, more inclined to tranquillity (samatha) meditation, tended to identify the passions that could be stilled by such meditation as the yogin's main foe; while others, more inclined to insight (vipasyanli) meditation,"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"70 Is Enlightenment Possible? Clinging to such a self, we fail to apprehend the essential transience of all conditioned phenomena (ourselves included), and at the same time gen-erate acquisitiveness and defensiveness for the sake of this self, which in turn become attachment and aversion. Belief in a self, thus, generates the whole complex of defilements that propels us through saI'flsara.9 As with the truth of suffering, the general parameters of the truth of origination have remained largely intact since the formulation of the earliest Buddhist traditions. Where there have been variations, they have tended to arise in the interpretatiCln of the \"ignorance\"that keeps us circling in sal'!lsara: each new Buddhist school of thought and practice quite naturally assumed that ignorance of its fundamental principle was the ignorance that perpetuates sal'!lsara. Thus, a Theravadin might insist that \"ignorance\"is the belief in an immutable self, a Madhyamika that it is grasping at the \"inherent existence\" of any entity or concept, a Yogacara that it is the acceptance of entities ex-ternal to the consciousness that cognizes them, a Zen master that it is ignorance of our innate enlightenment, and a Nichiren priest that it is our failure to recognize the supremacy of the Lotus Satra. Regardless of their varying notions of ignorance, however, most Buddhists, both Hinayana and Mahayana, have accepted the basic as-sumptions underlying the truth of Origination, which center on the fundamental principle of dependent origination (pratUya samutpiida), i.e., the universal operation of causality. For Buddhist soteriology, per-haps the most important corollary of the \"law\" of dependent origination is its application to the moral realm, in the form of the identified ignorance as that which had to be opposed. 9 The process of the origination of sarp.sara is described in somewhat greater detail byway of the \"twelve links\"(nidanas): (1) ignorance entails defiled ac-tions, which leave (2) (karmic) formations in the mental continuum, some of which will come to fruition as the initial (3) cognition of a particular rebirth. Cognition entails a particular combination of aggregates, a (4) name-and-form, which itself entails (5) six \"entrances,\"five for sense-objects, one for mental objects. Such entrances imply (6) contact between subject and object, which leads to (7) sensations, pleasant, painful or neutral. Sensations entail, in turn, a (8) craving for their continuance or discontinuance, which turns soon to (9) grasping. Grasping is a fundamental mode of action throughout life, and at the end of life; one grasps for continued existence, thereby (10) becoming still another set of aggregates, which, like all others, undergoes the inevitable processes of (11) rebirth and (12) aging and dying. Since the seeds of ignorant actions are being sown at virtually every moment, the rebi.rtJ:ts one is \"sched-uled\"to experience are limitless-especially since this process has been un-derway beginninglessly. ."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"What Buddhists Claim Is True 71 concept of karma. In other words, it is in the very nature of the cosmos that sentient actions have positive or negative\" qualities,\" and actions of a particular quality or intensity will-given the reality of dependent origination-entail reactions, or results, of an \"appropriate\" (if not al-ways\" equal\") quality or intensity.lo Other corollaries of the principle of dependent origination include the assumption that the set of causes and results that is the cosmos is beginningless-since every result pre-supposes a cause, and the chain must therefore be infinite-and multiple-since the variety of results cannot be accounted for by a sin-gle cause. The beginninglessness and multiplicity of the causal realm, in turn, obviates the possibility that there is a single creator of the sort posited by Jews, Christians, Muslims and most Hindus. A final, impor-tant implication of dependent origination is that, since all results have particular causes, to the degree that a cause can be known and con-trolled, the result can be controlled. This includes the idea that if a cause is eliminated, its effect will be, too; thus, if the cause of sal!lsara has been identified, controlled and eliminated, then sal!lsara will be eliminated, too. Sal!lsara, hence, is subject to cessation. D. THE TRUTH OF CESSATION The truth of cessation in its most basic sense is the assertion that there is a state or condition that transcends the suffering cycle of sal!lsara and which, once attained, never is subject to decay. It is the state whose at-tainment permits the Buddha to proclaim, after his enlightenment, \"My liberation is unshakeable, this is my last life, there is no more rebirth for me\"l1; \"birth is destroyed, spiritual practice is complete, what is to be done is done, there is no more of this sort of existence\"; and \"the con-taminants are destroyed, what is to be done is done, the burden is laid down, the true goal is attained, the fetters of becoming are destroyed, I am liberated by perfect knowledge.,,12 This summum bonum is generally known as nirvar:ta, which means, literally, \"extinction.\"Nirvar:ta is said, at 10 Thus, to cite a common example, murder in this life will result in one's being murdered in a future life and/or being reborn in a miserable realm, usually hell. The severity of the \"reaction\"to any action is dependent on the \"heavi-ness\" of the karma, i.e., the attitude, frequency, etc., with which an act is com-mitted. 11 M, i, 167; tr. Chalmers (1926-27) I, 165. 12 For complete references on these various \"victory formulas\" found in the nikayas, see Rhys Davids and Stede (1972) 77; see also Ergardt (1977) 1-8; and Homer (1936) 134-35."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"72 Is Enlightenment Possible? various times, to involve the extinction of contaminants, of ignorance, at-tachment and aversion, and of the five aggregates, and to be \"unborn, unchanging, uncreated, uncompounded.,,13 The question naturally has been raised whether nirvana thus is extinction in the sense of utter anni-hilation. The question is not easily answered, and only can become meaningful when we are careful to distinguish two fundamental usages of the word nirvaI!a: as the state attained by the Buddha under the bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, and out of which he functioned for the next forty-five years of his life; or as the condition an enlightened one enters at death, their \"final\"nirvaI!a (parinirvii1Ja). If we take nirvaI!a as the former, then clearly the\" extinction\" involved is not total, since, although the Buddha had extinguished all contaminants and defilements, he certainly contin-ued to \"exist\" in the sense of possessing aggregates. It is nirvaI!a as parinirvii1Ja that is the more problematic, for once this condition has been attained, the aggregates are extinguished and one ceases to influence or be influenced by the world. This sounds a great deal like complete extinc-tion, and yet we must remember that the question whether the Tathagata exists, does not exist, both exists and does not exist or neither exists nor does not exist was one that the Buddha refused to answer. It is dangerous on our part to speculate what he \"meant\" by this refusal, but it is worth noting that to say that the Tathagata does not exist after death is inappro-priate: this at least leaves the door open for his possible existence in some manner very different from our usual sense of \"existence,\" \"existence\" being excluded as an option because of the misunderstanding its asser-tion is likely to entail. If the Buddhist tradition has generally been consistent in its accep-tance of the specifics of the truths of suffering and origination, there is far less unanimity on the question of the nature of nirvaI!a: consider-able differences exist not only between Hinayana and Mahayana, but within each of these traditional divisions. The summum bonum of the Theravada and, to the degree that we can infer it from the nikiiyas and iigamas, of early Buddhism is seen as a state entirely beyond suffering or change, a sphere of immutable bliss. One who has attained this state is generally characterized as an arhant, a \"worthy one.\" At the very least, an arhant is beyond sa~sara, free from all defilement and suffering, possessed of the certain \"knowledge of the destruction of all contaminants\" (sarviisrava~ayaji'iiina). Depending, then, on the degree of their experience with the dhyanas, they may possess various other \"superknowledges\" (abhijnii), including clairvoyance, clairaudience, 13 Udiina, 80; tr. Woodward (1948) II,98."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"What Buddhists Claim Is True 73 retrocognition, telepathy and magical powers (such as flying, walking through walls, etc.). Arhants who have experienced the full range of the dhyanas possess all of the superknowledges, but they still lack the historical role and pedagogical skill of the highest of all arhants, a buddha. Buddhas appear at regular intervals in the world -cycle, but they are generally separated by thousands of years. Sakyamuni Bud-dha' ne Siddhartha Gautama, was the fourth buddha of this particular kalpa; he lived well over two thousand years ago, and it will be many centuries yet before his successor, Maitreya, descends. It is important to note that although a buddha is cognitively and pedagogically supe-rior to other arhants, spiritually they all are equal, since the essential criterion 'of spiritual \"victory\"is transcendence of s~sara, which has been effected by all arhants. Although the various \"Hinayana\" tradi-tions agree on these basics, as well as on the fact that a buddha no longer is a part of the world-scene once he has left the body in which he attained enlightenment, the Theravada does depart from \"early\" Buddhism in its insistence that a buddha is omniscient, an attribute that is expressly denied him by the nikayas.14 In the Mahayana, the arhant ideal of the Hinayana is disparaged, and the summum bonum redefined as unexcelled perfect enlightenment (anuttarasamyaksa1?tbodhi), or buddhahood (buddha tva) . Arhantship is disparaged for a variety of reasons: its achievement is motivated by a selfish concern with one's own liberation only; arhants are content with a quiescent final nirvar:ta, happy to be off the world-stage; arhants fail to realize the utter voidness (sunyata) of all phenomena, their realiza-tion being restricted to the no-self (anatman) of persons; arhants lack the great skill-in-means that ought to be exercised by an enlightened being; arhants have eliminated the gross obstacles to perfection, but not the subtle ones-or at least not the traces of the subtle ones.1S Ma-hayanists did not deny that an arhant was liberated from saqlsara, but this achievement no longer was regarded as the summum bonum. In some versions of Mahayana soteriology,16 arhants were doomed to an eternity of \"mere\" nirvar:ta, having forever lost the opportunity to pro-gress to the greater goal of buddhahood; in other versions-these 14 See Jayatilleke (1980) passim; and D, i, 17-18, tr. Rhys Davids and Rhys Davids (1952) 1,29; D, iii, 134, tr. ibid. III, 126; and M, i, 482, tr. e.g., Jayatilleke (1980) 468. . 15 The Lotus Sutra (see Vaidya [1960aj, Kern [1963]) is a particularly rich source of polemics such as the preceding. 16 E.g., the writings of certain Yogiicaras, such as Asanga."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"74 Is Enlightenment Possible? came to predominate-it was assumed that after a period of selfish in-dulgence in the bliss of liberation, an arhant would be \"awakened\" by the power of the buddhas, and would continue the ascent to full buddhahood.17 The buddhahood attained at the culmination of the Mahayana path was a state considerably more exalted than that attributed to Sakya-muni Buddha by the nikiiya/iigama or Theravadin traditions. A fully enlightened buddha was eventually said to consist of three \"bodies\" existing on different levels of subtlety: the Dharma Body (dhar-makiiya), which represents the perfection of mental abilities, is totally free from the slightest trace of even the subtlest obscuration,18 and at the same time totally omniscient, totally compassionate, and su-premely powerful in guiding sentient beings; the Enjoyment Body (sarrbhogakiiya), which represents the perfection of communicative abilities, is an \"ethereal\"body, replete with the varibus \"marks\" of a great being, that.is established in the akani~tha heaven, where it teaches the Mahayana to high-level bodhisattvas until (if there is such a time) the end of sal!lsara; the Transformation Body (nirmii1J.akiiya), which represents the perfection of bodily activity, is multiple, the countless \"physical\" forms taken by a buddha in order help sentient beings. Transformation Bodies may be inanimate or animate, animal or human, but the best known are those periodic appearances we call \"historical buddhas,\" such as Siddhartha Gautama in the past and Maitreya in the future. For the Mahayana, it still is theoretically possi-ble for a fully-enlightened being to \"disappear\" into final nirvaI).a, but it almost never occurs, because the force of compassion will prevent the buddha from doing so as long as there are sentient beings yet to be delivered. Thus, Sakyamuni's \"parinirviilJa\" was not the utter disap-pearance of that buddha, but merely the withdrawal of one of his Transformation Bodies. \"Sakyamuni\"is, in fact, eternal in lifespan, and virtually infinite in his manifestations.19 This is the classic Mahayana 17 It ought to be noted that the term nirvii1;za sometimes is used by Mahayanists to denote the limited state achieved by arhants, and sometimes as synony-mous with buddhahood. 18 This \"negative\" aspeCt of the Dharma Body often is referred to in later tradi-tions as the Essential Body (svabhavakaya). 19 For discussions of the late, fully developed Mahayana notions of buddhahood, see, e.g., The Dalai Lama (1985) 99-109 and Williams (1989). The concepts were developed systematically primarily within the Yogacara, and are fully exposed for . the first time in such texts as the Mahiiyiinasutrala1?lkara, attributed to Maitreya, and the Mahiiyiinasa1?lgraha of Asanga."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"TNhat Buddhists Claim Is True 75 view of buddhahood; it was modified, at various times, by different traditions that arose within the Mahayana. Thus, the tantric traditions elaborate still further by positing such \"bodies\" as the Body of Great Bliss (mahiisukhakaya) or Diamond Body (vajrakaya); \"mind\" -oriented meditative traditions such as the Great Seal (mahamudra) and Great Perfection (T. rdzogs chen) \"psychologize\"the three buddha-bodies as the voidness, clarity and referentiality (or compassion) of the mind20; while the Zen tradition tends to de-emphasize (at least rhetorically) the extraordinariness of buddhahood, seeming at times to equate it \"merely\"with a direct realization of the nature of reality-itself some-times simply described as \"ordinary mind.\" There is considerable divergence among the various versions of the summum bonum posited by different Buddhists, but all do agree that the truth of cessation is true, that there does exist some state that tran-scends the suffering of saI!lsara. To assert this, in turn, is to assert that the nature of the mind is such that its faults can be eliminated-since it is the mind that determines whether one is deluded or enlightened. Thus, the mind is held in some sense to be perfectible, capable of knowledge that is both true and salvific, able to comprehend the truth that \"will make you free.\" Thus, the epistemology posited in Bud-dhism-for all its analysis of the delusions that we superimpose on reality-is an \"optimistic\" one, maintaining that we are, in the final analysis, capable of truly and directly knowing reality (how \"reality\"is defined will, of course, vary from tradition to tradition), and that knowledge of reality can be spiritually liberating. E. THE TRUTH OF PATH The truth of path, finally, centers on the assertion that there exists a set of procedures that, ultimately, issues in the cessation of suffering: as the Buddha remarks, the goal and the path flow into each other like the Ganges and Jamuna rivers. 21 It is probably in their definitions of the path that the traditions that call themselves Buddhist are most at variance; in-20 See, e.g., Wang-ch'ug dor-je (1978) 119-20, 144-46; and Jig-me Iing-pa (1982) 96. These two traditions, which are important parts of Tibetan Buddhism to this day (emphasized, respectively, by the bKa' brgyud and rNying rna schools) arose in India among the mahasiddhas, great tantric wonder-workers. Rheto-rically, and viewed in isolation, the Great Symbol and Great Perfection are similar to Zen; in a larger historical and practical context, however, they are in-separable from tantrism, which has had little influence on Zen. 21 D, ii, 223; tr. Rhys Davids and Rhys Davids (1951) II,261."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"76 Is Enlightenment Possible? deed, traditions often are distingiuished from one another primarily on the basis of the path upon which they set their followers. To delineate all the varieties of Buddhist paths is far beyond the scope of a work such as this. We shall have to content ourselves with laying out the general pa-rameters of the main Hinayana and Mahayana versions of the path. It ought to be noted clearly at the outset that the nikiiyas and iiga-mas contain a bewildering variety of path-schemes, some of them quite systematic, like the famous \"eightfold noble path\" that com-prises the fourth noble truth in the sermon at Sarnath,22 or the \"thirty-seven limbs of enlightenment\"spelled out in the Mahiiparinib-biina Sutta23; others somewhat more loosely strung together, like the progression toward knowledge of the destruction of contaminants by way of detachment, the dhyanas, and various psychic powers, as de-scribed in the Samannaphala Sutta.24 There is not, in fact, any single path-scheme that dominates the nikiiyas and iigamas, and it is more than likely that what is represented there is a great number of differ-ent \"authentic\" traditions handed down from earlier times to the writers of the canon, some emphasizing the dhyanas, others stressing dispassion, still others focusing on the centrality of insight into no-self. Which, if any, of these the Buddha himself stressed, historians never will know. The Theravada tradition, especially in the person of its greatest scholiast, Buddhaghosa, organizes the canonical material into a co-herent scheme that centers on the \"threefold\"path of morality (P. sila), concentration (samiidhi) and wisdom (P. pannii). Morality, which con-sists essentially in refraining from such non-virtues as killing, stealing, 22 See above, p. 21. Rod Bucknell (1984) has found a number of places in the nikayas where the path should be ten-fold, with the addition of right insight and right liberation. 23 D, ii, 120; tr. Rhys Davids and Rhys Davids (1951) II, 128-30. The thirty-seven are: the four foundations of mindfulness (of body, sensations, mind and dharmas), four exertions (in preventing non-arisen evil from arising, elimi-nating evil that has arisen, developing good that has not been developed, and maintaining good that has been developed), four powers (of will, thought, energy and investigation), five faculties (faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom), five strengths (identical to the faculties, only in-tensified); seven factors, or qualities, of enlightenment (mindfulness, dis-crimination, energy, joy, tranquillity, concentration and equanimity) and the eightfold path. For an account of the doctrine of the Buddha in terms of the thirty-seven limbs, see Warder (1980) chapter 4. 24 D, i, 51ff.; tr.

Minimally, concentration involves the ability to contemplate an object without any distraction for as long as one chooses. Additionally, concentration may involve exploration of the dhyanas (P. jhiina) and the superknowledges that result from them. Even total familiarity with the dhyanas, however, is considered a basically mundane achieve-ment; in order to be salvific, concentration must be coupled with wisdom. Indeed, with a concentrated mind, one must examine the na-ture of reality, developing insight into the body, sensations, mind and dharmas until one directly realizes the \"truth\" -whether formulated as the four noble truths, the \"three marks\" of phenomena (imperma-nence, suffering, no-self), or in some other way. When a concentrated mind realizes the truth directly (as opposed to intellectually), then a radical transformation has occurred: one has become an arya (P. ariya), no longer subject to rebirth in the lower realms, destined for enlight-enment within, at most, seven lifetimes. Aryas are classed into streamwinners (srotiipanna, P. sotiipanno), who will be enlightened within seven lives, once-returners (sakrdiigiimin, P. sakadiigiimin), who will be enlightened in the next life, non-returners (aniigiimin), who will be enlightened from a heavenly realm after death and, finally, those who actually are enlightened, arhants. Arhants, as we have seen, are divisible in various ways, depending on their experience with the dhyanas; most fundamentally, they are divided into those who are \"liberated through wisdom,\" i.e., have developed one-pointed con-centration and combined it with wisdom, and those who are \"liberated in both ways,\"Le., have experience with the dhyanas and have combined it with wisdom. The former sometimes are referred to as \"dry\" arhants, the latter as \"wet\"arhants.25 Within the Sanskritic schools of the Hinayana, the same basic ma-terial was organized into a five-path scheme. At the point where one has become utterly convinced that sarr-sara is a raging inferno from which one must escape, one enters the first of the paths, that of accu-mulation (sa1?lbhiiramiirga), where one lives a thoroughly moral life, develops some skill at concentrating the mind, and familiarizes one-self with the four foundations of mindfulness. On the path of application (prayogamiirga), one further deepens one's concentrative ability, and contemplates the four noble truths in their sixteen as-25 For details on the Theravada path, see Buddhaghosa (1976)."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"78 Is Enlightenment Possible? pects.26 One ascends through four different stages of the path of ap-plication, culminating in the \"highest worldly dharma,\" which leads directly to the \"union of tranquillity and insight\" (samathavipasyana-yuganaddha) that is applied to a direct realization of the four noble truths (especially of the central truth of no-self). With the first mo-ment of this realization, one has achieved the path of seeing (darsanamarga) and become an arya. On the path of seeing one 'IUp_ roots\" gross defilements, especially those relating to our habitual misapprehension of reality. On the path of development (bhavanamiirga), one uproots defilements of other types and of increasing subtlety, until fi-nally only the subtlest of the subtle defilements remain. When the last of these has been removed, one attains the path of no-more-training (aSai~miirga), and is an arhant. The different types of fuya described above (stream winner; etc.) may be correlated with different degrees of progression on the paths of seeing and development, and the different types of arhants are as in the Theravada.27 Like the material in the nikayas and agamas, much of the \"path -theory\" of the Mahayana siitras is only partially systematized. The Mahayana's ideal path-traveller, the bodhisattva, is enjoined to develop faith in the buddhas, expressed in various acts of devotion, and great compassion (karuna) for suffering sentient beings, while all the time 'realizing that neither they, nor sentient beings, nor suffering, nor buddhas exist in an ultimate sense, all being void. The bodhisattva's path often is said to involve six \"perfections\" or transcendent virtues (paramita): gener-osity, morality, patience, effort, concentration and wisdom, to which sometimes are added skill-in-means, aspiration, power and gnosis. Alternatively, the bodhisattva is said to be accumulating two great \"stores\" (sa1!lbhiira), of merit and gnosis, that will eventuate, respec-tively, in the Form (rUpa, i.e., Enjoyment and Transformation) Bodies and Dharma Body of a buddha. There also developed a scheme of ten stages or \"grounds\" (bhumi) through which a bodhisattva passes be-fore enlightenment, each involving the perfection of one of the paramitas, each endowing one with geometrically expanding powers of magical manifestation for the assistance of sentient beings.28 26 See above, pp. 50-51. 27 The classic source for this path-scheme is AI<, esp. chapter vi. 28 For a good account of the Mahayana path as described in this paragraph, see Dayal (1970)."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"What Buddhists Claim Is True 79 The five-path scheme of the Sanskritic abhidharmikas eventually' was applied to the Mahayana material as well,29 resulting in a paral-lel-but quite different-formulation of the path. Here, after first convincing oneself of the futility of sal'!'saric existence, one goes on to develop the prime \"motive\"of the Mahayana, bodhicitta, the \"thought of enlightenment\"that aspires to buddhahood so that one may best assist other sentient beings. When bodhicitta is utterly spontaneous and natural, one enters the path of accumulation, where, as before, one develops morality, concentration and the foundations of mindful-ness. On the path of application, one continues to deepen one's concentration, and to analyze the nature of reality, which is voidness. When calm and insight have been united with voidness as an object, and a direct realization ensues, one enters the path of seeing, having become an arya. The path of seeing is said to be equivalent to the first of the ten bodhisattva stages. On the path of development, which comprises the nine remaining stages, one uproots all of one's defile-ments, not only those-uprooted by Hinayana sravakas and pratyekabuddhas-that inhibit one's liberation, but also those subtle de-filements or trace-defilements-uprooted only by bodhisattvas-that keep one from the omniscience of a fully-enlightened buddha. Finally, when the last of the subtlest trace of defilement has been removed, one enters the path beyond training, as a buddha. In addition to this \"mainstream\" Mahayana path-scheme, which came to dominate the late Indian and the Tibetan tradition, there are, of course, many others. The tantras describe a whole variety of prac-tices, from visualizing oneself as a buddha-deity at the center of a m~9-ala, to the recitation of complex mantras, to working within one's\" subtle body\" to develop an \"illusory body\" and a \"clear light\" awareness-with or without the assistance of a consort of the oppo-site sex. Zen-as do the Great Seal and Great Perfection traditions-concentrates on the direct realization of the nature of one's mind, seen as essentially luminous and wise. The Pure Land traditions focus on the recitation of the name of Amitabha Buddha so that one may be born after death into his western paradise, Sukhavati-there to enjoy great happiness, and thence eventually to proceed to full buddhahood. 29 By \"Maitreya,\"in the Abhisamaylilarrzklira (fifth century?). See Conze's translation (1954), and E. Obermiller's seminal study, Analysis of the Abhisamayala~ra (1933,1936). The full development of the scheme that was taken over into Tibetan . tradition was effected by Haribhadra (eighth century?), in his Abhi-samayalarrzklimloka."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"80 Is Enlightenment Possible? The Nichiren schools insist that the\" one thing needful\"is recitation of a formula praising the Lotus Sutra. The list could go on and on-Bud-dhist practice is even more varied, perhaps, than Christian-and each new tradition, regarding itself as the highest or most essential of the Buddha's teachings, tends to generate its own path-scheme, which mayor may not be assimilable to the over-arching structures outlined above.3D However bewildering the variety of Buddhist path-schemes may be, every post-nikayalagama scheme has one essential characteristic: it insists that attainment of the summum bonum is dependent on the pro-found realization of one central fact, or truth. Different schools, of course, differ on just what that truth is: it may be no-self, or voidness, or mind-only, or one's own innate enlightenment, or the power of Amitabha's name, or the centrality of the Lotus Sutra. There is, how-ever, at least implicit agreement among nearly all Buddhists that there must be a principle whose realization, or effectuation, assures one's liberation, and that there must be a procedure for realizing that prin-ciple. For the more \"wisdom\" -oriented Buddhist schools, the procedure is what broadly would be called \"meditation\" (the union of tranquillity and insight, of concentration and wisdom) that has the power to effect liberation; for the \"faith\" -oriented traditions, some \"act\" is essential-though an act, of course, must be preceded by some sort of decision, hence a realizatton. In every case, the belief holds that there do exist certain cognitions and/or acts that have the power radi-cally to change the sort of being one is-at the very least, from a saf!1saric into an enlightened being. Thus, just as the truth of cessation entails positing a certain \"nature\" for the mind (as perfectible), the truth of path entails positing certain \"powers\" for the mind (as per-fecting). Neither of these, of course, bears much resemblance to the modern vision of the mind, any more than the theories of rebirth and karma resemble modern cosmology, but they are at the core of what Buddhists traditionally have believed to be the case. 30 The five-path scheme, though not unknown to the Sino-Japanese tradition, has not been nearly as influential there as it has been in Tibetan Buddhism, which subsumes both the varieties of Tantra and the Great Seal and Great Per-fection (which themselves are at least quasi-tantric) under the five paths.,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"6. Religious Argument If, then, Buddhists have been quite serious in their assertion of the four noble truths, how do they go about arguing that these truths are true, that, e.g., past and future lives are real and enlightenment possible? Some an-swers to this question will be forthcoming-indeed, Dharmakirti's arguments for these truths are the main focus of this book-but before we turn to the matter of how Buddhists argue for the truth of those propositions they consider most fundamental, we must first be certain whether they would or should so argue. Whether or not religious truth-claims can or should be demonstrated is a question that has exercised religious people in many places and times, and we shall consider it both generally and with reference to Buddhism. A. THREE ARGUMENTS AGAINST RELIGIOUS ARGUMENT It undoubtedly would be too cynical to suggest that the reluctance of re-ligious people to argue for the validity of their truth-claims is inversely proportional to the amount of evidence they are able to present. At the same time, religious truth-claims are, as we have seen, often extraordi-nary, in the literal sense that they describe realities that are beyond the reach of the sensory capacities of ordinary humans. It is not easy to dem-onstrate the truth of such propositions as \"God exists,\"\"past and future lives are real,\" or \"enlightenment is possible.\"That such propositions are true, however, is of great importance to religious people. Given proposi-tions whose truth is vital yet difficult to prove, religious people often find themselves appealing to the notion that religious truth-claims somehow are different from other sorts of truth-claims, and therefore may be ac-cepted as true without recourse to argument or demonstration of the sort demanded of ordinary truth-claims. One\" argument against argument\" is the appeal to ineffability, to the notion that both the object and the experience at the core of relig-ion are beyond the capacity of any language to describe. It undoubtedly is true that both the subjective and objective poles of re-ligious experience are complex and often mystifying. However, to claim that a transcendent object is indescribable-and therefore not"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"82 Is Enlightenment Possible? subject to ordinary checking procedures-because it is transcendent is both tautologous and contradictory. It is tautologous because the \"transcendent object\" is used as the reason proving its own reality; it is contradictory because if reality is completely ineffable, then any des-ignation of it, even as \"ineffable\"-let alone as \"holy\" or \"void\"-is meaningless. As Peter Moore notes, if religious experiences are utterly ineffable, then those who report them must not be believed, for utter ineffability requires silence, while if reports actually are made, they in-evitably are descriptive, invoking images and terms familiar to the audience, and so presuppose precisely the sort of communicability that the claim to ineffability seems to deny.l Literally, then, ineffability is absurd; taken, however, rather more functionally, we see that it serves at least two purposes: it helps to lo-cate an extreme point on the human experiential continuum, to indicate an experience that is least like other experiences; and it under-lines the inadequacy of language for describing much of our experience.2 Neither of these functions establishes religious experi-ence as unique, however, since there are many candidates for the \"extremity\" of experience, from battle, to sex, to childbirth, to the taste of a fresh baguette; each of these is to some degree ineffable, yet each has been described for people who have not had the experience, hence is not, strictly speaking, ineffable; and even if an experience has been described \"only\"by way of analogies, those analogies assure that the experience finds its way onto the continuum of generally available and comprehensible human experiences. As Renford Bambrough puts it, \"To hold that there may be inarticulate understanding is not to hold that there may be any understanding that could not be articulated.,,3 In short, then, ineffability claimed absolutely is self-contradictory, for nothing then can be asserted meaningfully; while ineffability claimed relatively is not really ineffability, but a statement about the difficulty one is having in explaining a particular experience. Any experience that is de-scribed-and even the most recondite mystical experiences have been described-is susceptible of comparison with other experiences that we have had, and is therefore open to judgment and criticism as to, e.g., the appropriateness of the analogies employed or the reliability of the conclu-sions drawn from the experience. 1 Moore (1978) 101, 105. 2 Smart (1978) 17-18. 3 Bambrough (1978) '212."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Religious Argument 83 Another \"argument against argument\"rests on the claim that relig-ious propositions belong to a different class than, say, scientific propositions, and that they cannot, therefore, be expected to undergo to same sorts of \"rigorous\" or \"empirical\" or \"rational\" confirmation procedures as do the latter. Thus, religious truth-claims must b.e adju-dicated within the \"court\" of religious judgment, which may, in fact, admit as evidence attitudes and experiences that would be deemed in-appropriate if a scientific truth-claim were being tested. It certainly is important to recognize that different statements are made within dif-ferent cultural matrices and conceptual schemes, and that they only can be understood against the background of those matrices or schemes. It is quite another matter, however, to maintain that the truth of statements only can be judged from within their respective matrices or schemes-this is tantamount to an acceptance of truth as localized coherence, and we have already seen that the price for this is relativ-ism. If religious people were, in fact, claiming only such local coherence for their truth-claims, then there would be little problem with appealing to different courts of judgment. Since, however, most religious people have intended their truth-claims to be taken literally and universally, Le., \"correspondently,\" it is disingenuous for them then to try to exempt those claims from the sorts of checking procedures that generally are applied to hard claims of the correspondence sort. A religious person cannot, iI) short, make a hard claim and expect to have\" soft\" evidence accepted. Hard, Le., correspondence claims must, at the very least, be subject to some sort of testing: there must be some way in which they are determined to be true or false. Conversely, in-sists H.D. Lewis, if a religiOUS assertion cannot be proven or disproven, then \"it is without factual significance, and makes no genuine truth-claim.\"4 Peter Donovan agrees: \"Statements which fail to pay the necessary price for factuality (Le., being open to confirming or falsify-ing observations) cannot be counted as statem_ents of fact.\"s W.V. Quine and J.S. Ullian add that \"What stands open to fresh verification may merit special confidence, since such a belief has been withstand-ing greater risk ofdisproof.,,61t is potential falsifiability that is the key to the meaningfulness of a religious assertion, for, as Ninian Smart notes, 4 Quoted in Donovan (1976) 17. 5 Ibid., 20. 6 Quine and Ullian (1970) 39."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"84 Is Enlightenment Possible? Only a statement which sticks its neck out and runs the risk of being refuted in sense-experience is meaningful. If a supposed assertion does not do this, then it is a fraud. It is empty, mean-ingless (unless its truth simply arises from the meanings of the terms used in it). Thus, if I say 'There is a fairy at the bottom of my garden,'but it turns out I am thinking of a fairy which can-not be touched, smelled, seen, etc., then no counterevidence could challenge my': assertion and so by that very fact it is empty, meaningless.7 At the very least, says Donovan, the \"empiricist challenge\" to religion amounts to the contention that for religious statements \"some observa-tions must be agreed to count for or against them, some tests must be accepted as relevant to their credibility.\"B Each of the\" arguments against argument\" discussed above presup-poses that there do exist tests for determining the truth-value of statements, while at the same time seeking to exempt religious state-ments from those tests. A third, and final, \"argument against argument\" springs from a fundamental skepticism-alreadyal-luded to in chapter 2-about all truth-determinations, on the grounds that no statement in any realm really can be said to have been decisively verified, or, for that matter, falsified. Observation is limited, context-dependent and often \"prejudiced\"; logic is only as strong as its own unquestionable presuppositions; and experience is only interesting when the conclusions drawn from it are utterly un-controversial, hence trivial. In short, the very foundations of knowledge are thrown into question, leaving those who seek cer-tainty in any realm forced to admit defeat.9 The curious converse of this skepticism is that, since all knowledge-including the scien-tific-is called into question, there is no realm that enjoys a greater or lesser claim to certainty. Hence, religion, even if un demonstrable, is no more undemonstrable than is science and, in fact, can therefore make an equal claim .to truth.10 Ironically, then, skepticism, which for so long was seen by religious thinkers as vitiating religious truth-7 Smart (1979) 55. It should be pointed out in fairness that Smart beleives there are serious limitations to the application of the falsifiability criterion to relig-ious assertions, the limitations resulting from the limitations of empiricism and its observational techniques. See p. 56 and Ashby (1967) 240-47. 8 Donovan (1976) 24. 9 See Rorty (1979) for a clear exposition of this position. 10 Expressions of this may be found in; e.g., Wolfe (1982) and O'Flaherty (1984)."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Religious Argument 85 claims, now is embraced by some, with something like the philosophi-cal equivalent to the attitude that \"my enemy's enemy is my friend,\" i.e., an undermining of the foundations of science opens up the possi-bility that other-even traditionally religious-explanations of the cosmos may, in fact, be true. It ought to be evident that the evasion of argumentation on the ba-sis of skepticism is really no more satisfactory than that based on ineffability or \"different courts.\" First of all, there is the paradox of skepticism itself: if no knowledge is to be trusted, then skeptical knowledge is not trustworthy, either; hence, if skepticism is true, it must be false. Second, and more importantly, even if there is reason to believe that the foundations of knowledge may be less secure than we would like them to be, it does not mean that there is no basis for any judgments whatsoever. Neither verifiability nor even falsifiability may be an utterly secure standard on which to judge a scientific hypothesis, but judgment is necessary, and one applies the standards that, rela-tively speaking, seem least likely to produce misleading results: hence, whatever their ultimate shakiness as epistemological foundations, ob-servation and rational analysis remain important standards for determining scientific truth. By the same token, if religious truth-claims are to be meaningful in the least, there must be some way in which true and false claims can be separated. It is an open question whether the tests that are applied to religiOUS truth-claims ought to be the same as those applied to scientific ones, but that there must be tests there is no doubt, and to the degree that the sorts of truth-claims made by religious people are hard ones, the evidence will have to be commensurate, hence in some way concordant with observation and rationality. Finally, it ought to be noted that a justification of religion on the basis of skeptiCism is rather a pyrrhic victory, since it leaves one with, at best, a relativism that is contrary to the sort of universality so often sought by religious truth-claimants. B. ARGUMENTS AGAINST ARGUMENT IN BUDDHISM Each of these\" arguments against argument\"has found its champions within Buddhism. Buddhists have been as quick as other religious people to insist that their highest experiences and truths are ineffable-witness the Buddha's imprecision about nirval!a and refusal to discuss the tathagata's fate after death, or the lay bodhisattva Vimalakirti's famous summation of a dialogue about nonduality by his \"thundering silence.\" The exaltation of ineffability perhaps reaches its zenith in the Zen tradi-tion. We may recall that the Ho-shang Mo-ho-yen preferred silence to"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"86 Is Enlightenment Possible? debate when called to account by Indian pandits in Tibet, and that one of the paradigmatic Zen tales is of the Buddha's \"Flower Sermon,\"in which, presented a flower by the gods and asked for a discourse, he simply smiled and held the flower aloft silently. Zen at its best is, certainly, re-freshingly free of the sort of cant-not to mention contradiction-that can afflict a scholastic tradition, but Zen does function within an overall world-view (broadly speaking, a saI!1sara-nirvfu:!a cosmology) that is as-sumed to be true, and it does provide at least a symbol-language by which the ultimate it seeks may be indicated. The fact that a persimmon rather than a proposition may be used to indicate the nature of reality does not make the persimmon any less a form of human symbolization, hence, broadly, of speech. In a similar manner, Nagarjuna's insistence that he makes no propositions is literally self-contradictory and, in any case, to be understood as indicating the limits of language, or the lack of ultimate nature in what language describes-not as eliminating all propositions whatsoever. As in other religions, then, the appeal to ineffa-bility has an important place in Buddhism, but its purpose is to point up the difficulty in communicating or symbolizing certain objects and expe-riences, not to obviate all discussion of religiOUS truth-claims. The insistence that religious truth-claims are somehow of a differ-ent order than other sorts of truth-claims, hence subject to different criteria of judgment, also is encountered in traditional Buddhist litera-ture, albeit most often implicitlyY Thus, ultimate reality often is assumed by Buddhists to be a realm in which conventional epistemol-ogy and criteria of judgment do not apply. The ultimate object, e.g., voidness, is marked by the absence of ordinary signs and designations, including \"true\" or \"false\"; the experience of the ultimate object, e.g., via a wisdom consciousness, similarly lacks the characteristics of ordi-nary sense-perception or inference, hence cannot be described or judged in quite the same way that ordinary knowledge is; and the ex-periencer of the ultimate is held, by virtue of their experience, to be 11 While Buddhists certainly recognized that \"practicing the buddhadharma\"is different from, say, \"practicing medicine,\" and that different sorts of cognition and action were appropriate to each, they did not distinguish utterly different \"spheres\"of, e.g., religion and science, as have many in the West. It is impor-tant to remember that \"religion\"in the abstract is a Western invention; Asians generally have spoken of their particular Dharma or Tao, which is not a sepa-rate sphere of life so much as a \"way\" of seeing and acting that informs all ar-eas of human existence. Obviously, such distinctions become easier for modern Buddhists, who are familiar with Western categories. See, e.g., Conze (1967) I, 1, and Sangharakshita (1980) for arguments based on this distin~tion."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Religious Argument 87 beyond ordinary moral judgments, since their every action is informed by a \"higher\" realization than is available to ordinary people. At the same time, we have seen that the transcendent nature of ultimate re-ality does not preclude the conventional truth of conventional assertions, and conventional assertions presumably will be judged by conventional means, hence by recourse to \"arguments\"based on such criteria as observation and rationality. Furthermore, even the ultimate truths that lie beyond conventional signs and designations are as-serted to be true, hence subject to some criteria for determining what is and what is not so; are said to be objects of \"knowledge,\"hence to lie somewhere on the continuum of states that we conventionally con-sider cognitive; and are asserted to be both \"good\" and the basis for \"good\" actions by enlightened beings, hence to depend on the mean-ingfulness of the conventional distinction between good and evil. Thus, even if Buddhists seek to place certain truths or cognitions out-side conventional judgments of truth or falsity, those judgments still come into play, and so too must standards for judgment, i.e., means for determining truth or falsity. These may not be identical to the stand-ards that would be applied in science, but they must be similar at least to the degree that they are founded on some type of observation and rationality-or, as Buddhists would say, perception (pratyak~a) and in-ference (anumiina).12 Finally, challenges to the \"foundations of knowledge\" are not un-known in Asian philosophy. The Buddha encountered skeptics, such as PIlrana Kassapa, during his own lifetime, and later Buddhists had to contend with the radical skepticism of Carvakas such as JayaraSi, who sought in his Tattvopaplavasirrha (\"The Leonine Upsetting of All Theo-ries\") to refute all pOSSible pramiil,tas, or sources of authoritative knowledge, including those accepted by all Buddhists, perception and inference.13 Attacks on the foundations of knowledge came from within Buddhism, too. Perhaps the best-known such attack is found in Nagarjuna's Vigrahavyiivartani (\"Turning Aside Objections\"), where he argues that none of the traditional pramiil.taS is ultimately justifi-able, since they cannot, on the one hand, simply be presupposed, but cannot, on the other hand, be validated, since if they are self-validated they are tautologous, while if they are validated by some other pramiil.ta, then there will ensue an infinite regress of validating 12 For a provocative discussion of this idea, see Robinson (1971-1972). 13 See Radhakrishnan and Moore (1957) 236-44, for a translation of Jayarasi's demolition of inference."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"88 Is Enlightenment Possible? pram[uJas that only can be ended by resorting to circularity or tautol-ogy.14 Whatever traditional Buddhists may have made of this argument, at least one modern commentator15 has urged that its great value is to overturn any of the possible modes of argumentation that might be used against Buddhist views, hence that Buddhism somehow is more firmly established by the vitiation of conventional epistemol-ogy. Once again, however, the skeptic's path is strewn with paradox, for (a) the attack on epistemology is itself carried out within the framework of an attempt to establish what is the case, which only can, ultimately, be an object of \"knowledge\" and (b) the vitiation of con-ventional epistemology makes Buddhism equally likely and equally unlikely as any other view to be true. In fact, Nagarjuna's critique of the pramiiIJas probably does not entail total skepticism any more than his denial that he makes propositions is an appeal to ineffability; in each case, it is more likely that he is pointing out the limitations (i.e., \"voidness\") of certain conventional concepts and modes of thought-were he to deny them utterly he not only would lose himself in paradox, but would undercut the basis of the \"wisdom\" (prajiiii) that he seeks to establish. Prajna may transcend the limitations of conven-tional knowledge, but it still is knowledge, and for Nagarjuna to assert that it is knowledge, \"knowledge\" must have some meaning, and so, too, must the \"means of knowing,\" the pramiiIJas. If, in turn, the pramar;tas have conventional validity, then argumentation is bothnec-essary and desirable in settling matters of conventional truth-nor, for that matter, can ultimate truths be exempted: Nagarjuna, after all, must argue for voidness, Yogacaras for mind-only, and Zen Bud-dhists-after their fashion-for theindescribability of it all. 14 W, 30ff.; Bhattacharya (1978) 30; tr.

Pre-Dharmakirti Defenses of the Buddhist World-View Perhaps it is true that, as Edward Conze remarks, philosophical disputa-tion is \" [a]t variance with the spirit of Buddhism .... a radical departure from the spirit of ahimsa and tolerance which was so characteristic of Buddhism in its heyday.\"l Certainly, many early texts-perhaps most no-tably the Sutta Nipata-explicitly denounce disputation, opinion-mongering and attachment to particular philosophical views. It also is undeniable that, for most Buddhists at most times and places, philosophical disputa-tion was far from a major concern, and that authority was derived primarily on the basis of the testimony of scriptures or a spiritual teacher. At the same time, it should be evident by now that-at least in their en-counters with critical or curious non-Buddhists-Buddhist intellectuals really have little choice but to argue, since to make correspondent truth-claims about non-ordinary reality, as Buddhists traditionally have, is necessarily to invite some sort of test of the\" accuracy\" of one's state-ments. In fact, a survey of the course of Indian Buddhist thought shows that a small but influential number of Buddhists have argued forcefully and imaginatively for their truth-claims. The texts in which they did so may have been written primarily for a Buddhist audience-most religious texts are written by insiders for insiders-but this does not mean that the arguments reported or framed there did not or could not occur, or that the preoccupations of the authors were entirely intra-systemic: there is simply too much inter-systemic debate recorded in various texts to be-lieve that it did not occur.

At the same time, however, the first thousand years of Buddhist intellectual history hardly are lacking in attempts to justify the Buddhist world-view. They may not be as explicit or systematic as Dharmakirti's and those of his successors, but they do occur, and a review of a number of these argu-ments-and the problems they posed-will help us better to understand the background out of which Dharmakirti's discussion emerged. It ought to be said at the outset that the ultimate Buddhist criterion for unsuccessful or successful argument in religious matters probably is that expressed in the Buddha's famous \"advice to the KaJamas,\" where he warns against accepting statements as true merely on the basis of report, tradition, hearsay, logic, propriety or respect for the speaker; statements are to be verified, ultimately, only through per-sonal experience.2 This tells us two things about Buddhist confirmatory procedures: they are not, in principle at least, based on reliance on testimony or scripture, i.e., they are non-authoritarian; and they are strongly \"empirical\" in their thrust: even when later thinkers attempted to devise sophisticated inferential demonstrations of Buddhist truths, the final appeal offered by most Buddhists has been to confirmatory experience. Thus, the arguments regarded most suspiciously by Buddhist intellectuals are generally those that rely on testimony, while those most favored rely on personal experiential veri-fication. Neverthless, Buddhists have attempted arguments that seem to rest on testimony, or charisma, or analogy, or one or another logical schema, or-perhaps most commonly-applications of the \"law\" of dependent origination (pratltya samutpiida), and we will examine some of them before returning at the end of the section to consider the argument from experience. In spite of the Buddha's warning to the Kalamas not to accept state-ments simply out of respect for the speaker, and his criticism of both opponents and diSciples (e.g., Ananda) who make truth claims not based on personal experience, there seems to be a certain ambiva-lence, throughout the Buddhist literature, toward the value of testimony, charisma and faith. Faith (sraddhii) is, on the one hand, only supposed to be directed toward persons or propositions that have 2 A, i, 19; tr. is that of Woodward and Hare (1951-55) I, 173. Q. also Radha-krishnan and Moore (1957) 345-46."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Pre-Dhannaklrti Defenses 91 been partially verified through personal experience. On the other hand; one cannot even undertake a religious practice, such as the Bud-dhist path, without some prior \"faith\" that is likely to bear spiritual fruit-if one already knew through direct experience that it would bear fruit, one's attitude would no longer be faith, but knowledge. Since be-ginners do not yet know with certainty that the path will issue in success, they must by definition undertake it in part on the basis of faith-which is, in fact, one of the five \"faculties\" (bala; the others are effort, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom) to be applied on the Buddhist path. What, then, is the basis of faith? In part, of course, it must be the conformity of statements with our common-sense no-tions and with previous experience-this fact helps to separate the kind of faith valued in Buddhism from \"blind faith.\" Since, however, the referents of Buddhist religious propositions are matters beyond our ken, we most often will look for other reasons for placing faith in them or the person asserting them. Most often in Buddhist literature the \"reason\" for which faith is placed in the Buddha and what he teaches is, simply, his charisma, i.e., the fact that his behavior (includ-ing posture, countenance, speech, etc.) seems to point to some kind of extraordinary attainment. This is not a bad reason for having faith in someone, but it is not entirely rational, either, for there is no invariable concomitance between inner state and outer behavior: even a cursory look at the history of religions informs us that there are (a) inwardly spiritual people whose behavior is either unremarkable or, occasionally, repellant and (b) inwardly mediocre or evil people whose behavior is charismatic. Charisma, thus may be an indicator of spiritual worth, but it hardly is an adequate basis, by itself, for placing faith in a religious teacher. If a teacher's charisma is not by itself an adequate basis for faith, then what of the reasonableness of what they propound? Despite the Buddha's avowed suspicion of \"mere\"logic or inference, both the Bud-dha himself and early Buddhists adduced a number of arguments that are, explicitly or implicitly, based on logical principles of one sort or another. One of the most frequently used types of argument is that based on analogy. The Pali nikayas are full of analogies, of similes that illustrate a particular doctrinal point and thereby make it more compelling, from the likening of the Dharma to a raft on which one crosses to the . far shore of the river of salTlsara, to the comparison of idle philosophi-cal speCUlation to the ill-timed questions of a man shot by a poisoned arrow. Similarly, Mahayana siitra literature abounds in such analogies. The Lotus Sutra alone contains a number of seminal similes: the par-able of the burning house, which, as we have seen, illustrates the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"92 Is Enlightenment Possible? doctrine of the Buddha's skill-in-means; the story of the phantom city, which describes the provisional nature of the \"Hinayana\"nirvar;a; the image of the rain cloud, which represents the Buddha's impartial com-passion, etc.3 The most explicitly argumentative use of analogy is probably that of the post-nikiiya Pali text, the Milindapalihii, in which the bhikkhu Nagasena seeks to demonstrate a number of Buddhist truths to King Milinda through analogies. How, for example, Milinda asks, can we know that nirvar;a, though unconditioned, exists? We know this by mental perception, replies Nagasena, just as we know the existence of the invisible wind by the sensations it leaves.4 How can arhants ascer-tain that they will never be reborn again? By their knowledge that all possible causes of rebirth have been removed, just as a farmer who has quit farming and rid himself of all the grain in his granary knows that there is no further basis for filling the granary.s Examples from the Milindapaiihii could be multiplied greatly, but these two are typical, and they reveal the basic structure of-and problem with-analogical arguments. The structure is simply: unknown x is related to unknown y just as known x is related to known y; therefore unknown x and yare real. There are, however, both particular and general problems with this formulation. The particular problem is that in most of the analo-gies cited by Nagasena, the known examples are physical in nature, while the unknown objects that he seeks to prov~ are mental (or, at least, distinctly non-physical): to speak of nirvar;a as if it were the wind, or causes of rebirth as if they were grains is, very possibly, to ap-ply inappropriate characteristics to the category of the mental. Granted, Buddhists often apply \"material\"metaphors to \"mental\"top-ics,6 and may even view the mental through concepts borrowed from physical processes (e.g., causation), but that the boundary can be crossed so easily between the example and its probandum is not so clear. The more fundamental problem with analogical arguments'is a general one, namely, that they are not really arguments at all, but, sim-ply, statements of the sort: if such-and-such unknown is the case, it is like such-and-such known; or, such-and such unknown is the case, and it is like such-and-such known. The former statement is pr<;>vi-3 See Vaidya (1960), and the sutra's numerous translations, e.g., Kern (1963). 4 Rhys Davids (1963) II,124-27. 5 Ibid., I, 65-66. 6 See Collins (1982) for a particularly interesting analysis of some of Theravada Buddhism's guiding metaphors."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Pre-Dhannaklrti Defenses 93 sional, hence inconclusive, while the latter is dogmatic, hence incon-clusive. A somewhat more rigorous, and decidedly less poetic, mode of logi-cal argument is that employed in the Kathiivatthu, another post-nikiiya Pali: text, which is an account of early Buddhist doctrinal controversies. Here, the form of argument is as follows: \"You asssert proposition x; proposition x contradicts propostion y, universally accepted to be true; therefore, proposition x is false.\" It may be argued, for example, that arhants can fall from their spiritual pinnacle. However, the definition of arhant is such that they are, by definition, beyond return. Therefore, arhants cannot fall from their spiritual pinnacle.7 This represents an early attempt at systematic inference, but it occurs within the limited scope of intra-Buddhist debates. Therefore, the \"universally accepted\" propositions that are the basis of proof are, in fact, simply bits of Bud-dhist doctrine, drawn from scripture, whose truth-value still is open to question by outsiders. The argument may be conclusive to another Buddhist, who accepts Buddhist scripture as valid, but it cannot have much value for an uncommitted seeker. This, in fact, is-the fundamental problem with many earlier Bud-dhist demonstrations of the truth of Buddhist religious assertions: they beg the question by applying to the demonstration principles that either themselves are questionable or simply are too general to have much probative value. Examples of the former include the above-cited arguments from the Kathiivatthu, as well as such later Mahayana claims as those surrounding the notion of tathagatagarbha, our poten-tial for enlightenment, which is defended not only by recourse to analogies,8 but by the argument that we must be able to attain enlight-enment because (a) our desire to attain enlightenment, which is a \"good\" desire, must come from a \"good\" source, which must be the tathagatagarbha itself 9 and (b) the mind is by nature clear and pure, and its defilements adventitious. Argument (a) fails because the exist-ence of desire for an object does not assure the existence of the object. Argument (b) is problematic because the assertion that the mind is clear and pure by nature is not self-evidently true. Rather, it is derived 7 Aung and Rhys Davids (1960) 64-70. 8 As, e.g., the ten similes of the Tathagatagarbha Satra, cited at RGV i:94-5 (Johnston and Chowdhury [1950] 59ff.), tr.

This concept, which is absolutely fundamental to Buddhist thought, in-volves the application, to all realms of conditioned existence, of the theory of causation: \"This being, that occurs; from the arising of this, that arises; this not being, that does not occur; from the cessation of this, that occurs.\"U In other words, if x, then y; if no x, then no y. Be-cause this principle applies not only to the physical realm in which it most manifestly is valid, but also to the mental realm, Buddhist sote-riology can be stated in straightforwardly causal terms: if craving (x), then suffering (Y); if no craving (x), then no suffering (Y); therefore cessation (z). The obvious problem here is that it still remains to be demonstrated that the particular causal sequence described by, e.g., -the four noble truths, actually obtains. After all, given the general fact of dependent origination, or of universal causality, some causal rela-tions are possible, while others are not; it is entirely possible that craving is not the cause of suffering, or the removal of craving the cause of nirvaI).a. It is, of course, equally possible that these relations do obtain, but the point is that the mere assertion of the validity of a general principle of causation does not, ipso facto, guarantee that this or that particular application of the law is, in fact, the case. Whether particular applications are valid only can be decided on the basis of in-dependent observation or inference. Therefore, dependent origination cannot serve as an a priori argument for Buddhist soteriology. Thus, one cannot argue, as Nagarjuna seems to in his Vigra-havyiivartani, that (a) all entities are void, (b) all entities thW; are dependently originated and therefore (c) the four noble truths are true and enlightenment possibleY (a) may entail (b), but (b) does not nec-essarilyentail (c), for dependent origination may be the case without 10 For a discussion of some of the epistemological consequences of the idea that the mind is by nature luminous, see R.

The iibhidharmika tradition does not seriously question whether the dharmas that make up one or the other scheme correspond to actual features of the cosmos: it is assumed that most of the basic elements (including the cessation of suffering) are legiti-mately included in the schemata, and the problem then simply becomes one of explaining the elements in the most elegant and sat-isfactory manner. In a somewhat circuitous manner, therefore, we find ourselves back with the Buddha's advice to the Kalamas, for we have seen that nei-ther faith, nor testimony, nor analogy, nor narrowly-based inferences, nor a priori principles such as dependent origination can suffice to give an uncommitted seeker certainty that the fundamental assertions of Buddhism, the four noble truths and the spiritual supremacy of the Buddha, are actually true. The Buddha's advice, of course, and the ad-vice of countless Buddhist masters since him is, simply, \"ehi passako,\" come and see for yourself whether what I say is true, and once you have, you will have no need for faith, testimony, analogy, inference or a priori principles, for then you will know by direct acquaintance how things are in the cosmos. In short, the most important pre-Dhar-makirti argument for the truth of Buddhist religious assertions is what in the West would be called the argument from experience. How conclusive is the argument from experience? To do justice to this complex question would require a separate volume; here, I merely wish to focus on one important line of analYSis in recent discussions: the science/religion analogy. It often is suggested by proponents of the argument from experience that to travel a religious path really is no different from undertaking a scientific experiment: one begins with a hypothesis, e.g., enlightenment is possible, or past and future lives ex-ist, and then proceeds to execute a specified sequence of operations (Le., the path), at the end of which one will have one's answer through direct experienceY The analogy seems at first compelling, but there are certain problems with it. Donald Evans claims that there are at least three ways in which religious and scientific assertions are funda-13 For a fuller discussion of this issue, see R. Jackson (1985). 14 See Staal (1975) 51 and Burns (1971) 176."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"96 Is Enlightenment Possible? mentally different: (1) religious assertions are value-colored, while sci-entific assertions are value-free, i.e., logically neutral. In other words, religious\" experiments\" are far more likely than scientific ones to in-volve self-fulfilling prophecies. (2) Religious assertions are not comprehensible impersonally, while scientific assertions are; i.e., re-ligious assertions always have a psychological coloration that limits their universality. (3) Religious assertions, unlike scientific ones, are not testable by intersubjective observation, i.e., they always must re-main to a degree idiosyncratic. IS A fourth argument that might be made is that religious assertions, unlike scientific ones, are not usually designed to be falsifiable: one sets out to verify the hypothesis, and one is not likely to be credited with genuine religious experience by a given tradition if one concludes on the basis of following its path that the initial hypothesis is, in fact, false.16 This, in turn leads to the further problem of who is qualified to judge whether one has followed the ex-perimental procedure (i.e., followed the path) properly and whether one's conclusions are to be taken seriously. An arhant, in Buddhism, is supposed to be able to perceive another arhant, but how is one to be certain that the arhant judging one is really enlightened? If one traces their lineage of recognition back to the Buddha, one begs the ques-tion, for it is the validity even of the Buddha's understanding that is at issue. Furthermore, how does one account for the often contradictory (and sometimes demonstrably mad) statements made by religious vi-sionaries at different places and times? 1£ experience alone is sufficient warrant for the truth of their assertions, then they all must be true; and we can escape the relativism this implies only by arguing somewhat du-biously that all religious visionaries actually experience the same thing, but simply express it differently,17 or by appealing to some other criterion of validity, which removes us from the realm of the experience alone. 15 Evans (1974) 326-27. 16 Cf. Hoffman (1982) and (1987). 17 For several incisive essays attacking this position, see Katz (1978). The basic argument is that we never have access to anything like \"pure experience\"; we only have expressions, and expressions (particularly when contextualized) differ from case to case, forcing us to conclude that experiences differ, too. For a critique of Katz et al. that also is an attempt to establish the possibility of something like \"pure experience,\"see Forman (1990). An intermediate posi-tion is suggested by John Hick (1989), who although he claims (170-71) to side with Katz, might well be regarded as a partial ally by Forman et al., since he insists that there must be a \"Real\" that is the common basis of various re-ligious experiences-even if it nowhere and never is experienced \"purely.\"It"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Pre-Dhannakirti Defenses 97 Proponents of the argument from experience are not without reply. They may note that it has become increasingly clear as the century progresses that science is not nearly so neutral, or value-free, as once believed; that scientific experiments, just like religious quests, often are guided beforehand by what is sought; that many scientific hy-potheses are no more conclusively verifiable or falsifiable than are religious doctrines; and that the scientific community is just as liable as the religious to find itself trying to choose between competing paradigms that seem rationally or experimentally justified. IS In short, science is simply one among a number of discrete and only partially overlapping areas of human inquiry, guided by its own rules and beset by its own problems, and it cannot be taken as final and universally definitive any more than religion can. There is much to be said in favor of these points, yet they do not, by themselves, clinch the argument from experience. In the first place, the uncertainty surrounding a competing theory is not sufficient to es-tablish the truth of one's own: science may not be as certain as once it was, but that does not mean that religion is thereby rendered more certain. Secondly, although there may not exist the difference of kind between religious and scientific assertions claimed by Evans, there still, clearly, is a difference of degree: religious experiences are not only subjective experiences, but subjective experiences of a rather uncom-mon type; not only are they not easily verified intersubjectively, but they are difficult to comprehend even by analogy to more common subjective experiences. Therefore, regardless of whether religious vi-sions involve perception of the truth (and they may very well), claims made strictly on the basis of them cannot have the same general evi-dential weight as do claims that can be checked either intersubjectively or against more common types of subjective experi-ence-for, unless we are to accept a total relativism that is as unsatisfactory to the religious philosopher as to the scientist, we must (and we do, instinctively) accord greater weight to evidence that is more diSinterestedly gathered, more subject to intersubjective check-ing, more buttressed by ordinary perceptions and the inferences based on those perceptions. seems to me but a short step from the admission of such a URealUto the ad-mission that, in some way, all religious experiences must intend it in some . way, even if on a level inaccessible to speech or understanding. 18 On this issue, see especially Kuhn (1962) and Feyerabend (1975)."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"98 Is Enlightenment Possible? Thus, religious experience may convey truth, often helps to buttress the doctrines and beliefs of a particular religious community, and al-most invariably conveys certainty to the experiencer, but it is not a secure basis for convincing an uncommitted seeker that one's doctrine is, in fact, true. In the arena of public discussion,.one must appeal to more commonly accepted perceptual and inferential procedures. Early Buddhists made some attempts at this and, as we have seen, generally· raised as many problems as they solved. With Dharmakirti, a new and far more sophisticated attempt was made to show that those facts about the cosmos experienced as true by Buddhists who had followed the path could be shown rationally to accord with common perception and inference, to the point that any person who followed the Buddhist line of argument would be compelled to accept that its conclusions were true, so that the four noble truths were basic facts about the cos-mos and the Buddha was supremely accomplished in spiritual matters."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"8. The Turn to Epistemology and Logic Though the arguments we reviewed in the last se~tion were treated syn-chronically rather than historically (since our main interest was in types of arguments), we can, at least in general terms, trace an evolution of Buddhist religious arguments. Arguments seem to fall into three main phases, determined primarily by the overall position of Buddhism within the Indian philosophical scene at a given time. The first phase encom-passes Buddhism's formative period of two to three centuries. During this period, Buddhism was simply one of a vast number of religious alterna-tives available in India. The Buddha and his immediate successors were most concerned to differentiate their Dharma from those of Jainas, Ajivakas, Brahmins, and others. Most early Buddhist defenses of the Dharma do not, therefore, self-consciously presuppose its truth. Implicit or explicit arguments based on testimony, analogy or logic do, as we have seen, occur, but we alsQ have seen that the Buddha was aware of the limi-tations of such arguments, and his main appeal was to personal verification of the Dharma through actually practicing the Buddhist path. The Buddha-like Buddhists since him-was probably aware of some of the pitfalls of the argument from experience,l but he still felt that it pro-vided the surest means of guaranteeing to an outsider that the Dharma was in fact valid . . With Buddhism's increasing institutional stabilization and then, af-ter Asoka, expansion, Buddhists began to occupy themselves increasingly with intra-traditional concerns, with constructing and criticizing various arrangements of the basic elements of the Buddhist world-view-which were, for the purposes of discussion, assumed to be true. Early Buddhists had not had the luxury of such assumptions 1 The Buddha is clearly aware, in the nikiiyas, that religious experience can give false as well as true information (otherwise, he could not criticize the \"limited\" visions of non-Buddhist yogins) and various parts of the tradition have ap-. plied appropriate checks to the experience-reports of their adherents. For a discussion of the latter issue, see Girnello (1978)."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"100 Is Enlightenment Possible? in their initial attempts to justify the Dharma, but the authors of the great abhidharma treatises, the Mahayana sutras, and the early sastras of Madhyamaka and Yogacara were less concerned to refute non-Bud-dhist systems (though they did, of course, discuss them) than to refute errors within the Buddhist fold. Such internal discussions could pro-ceed most smoothly when a maximum number of presuppositions were shared by the discussants, and Buddhists, presumably, did not need to question the fundamental validity of their tradition, but sim-. ply the way in which it was to be interpreted most effectively. Thus, even as radical a figure as Nagarjuna, whose Madhyamika dialectic seems to invalidate all possible philosophical positions, is careful to distinguish the ultimate level, on which his dialectic is utterly destruc-tive, from the conventional level, on which dependent origination and causality still obtain, and on which the Buddhist world-view is pre-sumed (though not proven) to be correct.2 Early Buddhists had at their disposal only limited and rather unde-veloped modes of argumentation with which to defend the Dharma, which may in part explain their suspicion of logic and appeal to expe-rience. Buddhists of the second phase absorbed advances in logic and epistemology as they occurred, but their concerns were primarily in-tra-Buddhist, and their efforts directed primarily at better explaining the presupposed elements of the Buddhist world-view or-in the case of someone like Nagarjuna-using logic to criticize the belief that any-thing can be demonstrated conclusively by such traditional sources of knowledge as perception and inference. Nagarjuna's critique remains a fundamental one, and in some ways it represents the most sophisti-cated possible development of the early Buddhist suspicion of logic and argumentation, but it did not spell the end of constructive phi-losophizing in India.3 Indeed, it was in the post-Nagarjuna period, 2 See MMK\" chapter xxiv and VV verse 70. 3 It is a major point of contention in later Madhyamaka thought whether Nagarjuna even would have wanted to put an end to constructive philosophy. The Svatantrikas claimed that the use of formal inference (anumana) was jus-tified in some ultimate-level arguments, while the Prasangikas upheld the use only of the \"reductio,\" the prasanga. See Hopkins (1983) part five and Lopez (1987) 55-82 for detailed analyses. Interestingly, most Tibetan schools claim to be Prasangika, yet there is disagreement on what this means. The dGe lugs pas, for instance, tend to favor widespread use of formal inference, even in re-gard to ultimate truth.

Indeed (ideally, at least), the only assumptions that were to be made were those on which all disputants could agree, although these, of course, had to be the sort of logical and empirical truths that were common and basic enough to be beyond dispute. The central realization of the third phase of Buddhist argumenta-tion thus was, as A.K. Warder expresses it, that We cannot make any assured progress in philosophy or, there-fore, in the practice of Buddhism which is founded onknowl-edge of the truth, unless we first ascertain what sources of knowledge can be accepted. The theory of knowledge, there-fore, becomes the basis of all study and all practice ... going to the root of all philosophical problems.4 In other words, any tradition that concerns itself with \"truth\"must con-cern itself with establishing the foundations for secure knowledge, for without such foundations truth cannot be grasped firmly, and it is appre-hension of the truth-specifically of critical religious or philosophical truths-that is the basis for liberation in so many Indian religions. There-fore, anyone devoted to religiOUS knowledge had to be interested in epistemology, for it was epistemology that provided the basis for under-standing how any truth, religious or otherwise, could be apprehended and validated. Thus, the major preoccupation of an important segment of Buddhist philosophers, beginning with Dignaga (sixth century) is the problem of pramii1Ja, authoritative knowledge,s revolving around such questions as the number of pramii1Jas, their relationship, the intrinsic or extrinsic nature of their validity, and the fields of inquiry to which they could properly be applied. Buddhist philosophers concerned with pramii1Ja often came to dif-ferent conclusions on these issues than did their colleagues in other religious traditions, but there did develop a substantial body of shared assumptions, which greatly facilitated inter-systemic philosophical tradition. For discussions of the dGe lugs approach to rationality, see, e.g., Sweet (1979) and Klein (1986) 13-89. 4 Warder (1980) 449. 5 For a discussion of my translation of pramiilJa as \"authority,\" see below, p. 168, n. 5."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"102 Is Enlightenment Possible? discussion. There was, first of all, agreement (usually unstated) on the fundamental axioms of philosophical thought, which include such no-tions as \"the law of the conservation of being,\" where by something can neither come from nor turn into nothing; the definition of exist-ence as existence in space and time; the law of contradiction, whereby contradictory things cannot occupy the same place at the same time; the reality of causality, in which effects must be similar, but not iden-tical, to their causes; the implication of the existence of non-x simply on the basis of the existence of x; the inferability of the unseen from the seen; and the law of the excluded middle, whereby a thing must be either x or non -x. 6 There was, further, general agreement on rules for argumentation, and a careful cataloguing of the fallacies to be avoided in debate. These included self-residence (CitmCisraya), whereby a term is used il-legitimately to explain itself, much like question-begging in Western thought; reciprocal dependence (anyonyCisraya) and vicious circle (cak-raka), both examples of circularity in which an initial term is explained by a second or subsequent term, which then is explained by the first term; infinite regress (anavasthCi), whereby a term's relation to a sec-ond term is explained by a third term whose relation to the first and second terms must be explained by a fourth term and so on, ad infini-tum; and complexity (gaurava), whereby either entities or concepts are multiplied needlessly, leading to eventua1, if not immediate, explana-tory difficulties. 7 The most important area of agreement was on the nature and proc-ess of formal inference (anumCina), which has been described by many writers as the Indian \"syllogism.\" The term is not entirely unwar-ranted: an Indian formal inference differs structurally from an Aristotelian syllogism, and reflects somewhat different emphases, but is at least partially interchangeable with it, for both are instances of deductive processes rooted in universal principles arrived at through inductive generalization or definitional agreement. The Buddhist form of an Indian formal inference is as follows: 6 Robinson (1967) 63-65. The terminology he employs is, of course, more West-ern than Indian, but that there did exist Indian equivalents for the ideas behind the Western terms is difficult to dispute. 7 See, e.g., Potter (1976) 78-84 and Vidyabhusana (1978) chapter 34."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"SUBJECT (dharmin) is The Turn to Epistemology and Logic 103 PREDICATE (siidhya, dharma) because REASON (hetu, linga) as in ACCORDANT EXAMPLE (sajiinya dr~tiinta) unlike in NON-ACCORDANT EXAMPLE (vijiitiya dr~tiinta) The subject and predicate together form the thesis (pak~a, pratijiiii).

To demonstrate even more clearly the functional similarity between the two forms of inference, let us take the classic Western II chestnut\" example: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. This can be restated as an Indian-style inference based on synonymy (or \"own-nature\": svabhiiva): (SUBJECT) Socrates (PREDICATE) is mortal (REASON) because he is a man, (ACCORDANI) like Pericles (NON-ACCORDAN1) unlike Zeus. The syllogism is correct because (a) the reason is relevant to the subject, since Socrates is a man, (b) the reason is invariably concomi-tant with the predicate, since men are mortal and (c) the non-reason is invariably concomitant with the non-predicate, since if a being is not mortal he will not be a man. The addition of the accordant and non-accordant examples does mark the syllogism as peculiarly Indian, and the interchangeability of the two forms should not be overstated, but there is at least enough similarity that the rough translation I have suggested becomes plausible.There are countless other details of In-dian logical theory, some of which will be encountered later in the introduction or in the translation. This general account should suffice for now.s With the acquisition of a common \"language\" for conducting inter-systemic philosophical discussion, there existed for the first time the possibility that the different Indian traditions could debate among themselves the fundamental truth-claims that each system made, whether about epistemology, ontology, or even the path to spiritual liberation. Indeed, one's opponents were far more likely to criticize one's fundamental beliefs than one's commentarial glosses on re-ceived tradition, so we should not be surprised that the inter-religious debate in India became lively indeed. Buddhist philosophers used to intra-traditional discussions of abhidharma categories that did not re-8 For more detail, see, e.g., Stcherbatsky (1962) I:II:III, Mookerjee (1980) chap-ters XXII-XXIv, Potter (1976) 59-78, Solomon (1976-78), Vidyabhusana (1978) chapter 95, Perdue (1992) and various articles in Matilal and Evans (1986)."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Turn to Epistemology and Logic 105 . quire justification to other Buddhists suddenly found themselves de-fending the existence of past and future lives against Carvaka materialists, the possibility of liberation against both materialists and Mimarp.sakas, their denial of universals aginst the Vaise?ikas, their re-jection of a creator God against the Naiyayikas, the theory of momentariness against the Sarp.khyas and Jainas-and the theory of no-self (anatman) against virtually everybody. It should be evident from this that religion and religious truth-claims were not granted some special exemption from the need to conform to the newly developed canons of evidence and validity. Quite the contrary: to the degree that religion has always been a cen-tral part of Indian philosophical traditions, the justification of religious truth -claims became a major concern of many of those who developed new logical and epistemological tools, for religious truths were the most existentially significant of all possible truths, and therefore the truths most urgently in need of clear demonstration. That Indian phi-losophers genuinely believed that they could, and attempted to, prove religious assertions shows the confidence they felt in the rational techniques that had been developed. It shows, too, their implicit reali-zation that, whatever evidential value personal religious experience may have for the experiencer, it carries considerably less weight in public discussions, where the evidence of greatest value is that which is common to all participants. The basic axiom on which most later Indian philosophical discus-sions rest is beautifully stated by Dharmakirti at the outset of his Nyayabindu (\"Drop of Reasoning\"), where he writes, simply: \"All hu-man accomplishment is preceded by correct cognition.,,9 The focus on \"human accomplishment\"locates the philosophical enterprise within the projects, humble or exalted, that are so central to human existence. We are, quite simply, beings with goals, and the goals may vary from walking into the kitchen to make a cup of tea, to learning a mathe-matical theorem, to achieving total peace of mind. Our goals are valuable to us, and we consider them in some sense \"good,\"yet we cannot accomplish them unless we know what to do and what not to do in trying to achieve them.

To learn a mathematical theorem I must know certain operations by which numbers are combined, and must know not to calculate incorrectly or skip steps in reasoning. To achieve total peace of mind I must, if a Buddhist, know which virtues to practice and which vices to avoid, which views to shun and which to cultivate. In short, then, the accomplishment of human goals requires \"correct cognition.\"We must know what to adopt and what to reject, what to practice and what to avoid in the completion of our projects. If knowl-edge is so utterly vital even to the simplest human activirj, then the ascertainment of what is knowledge and what is not, of which asser-tions are reliable and which are not, becomes fundamental. One must, therefore, strive to understand the way in which knowledge functions, and come to know what is to be accepted and what rejected in the realm of epistemology itself-for once this has been determined, one can have greater confidence in one's knowledge in other areas of hu-man endeavor. Finally, then, Dharmakirti's axiom states that all human accomplishment is preceded by correct cognition. Thus, secure knowledge is required not only for ordinary human projects, but for \"ultimate\" ones, as well, and for most human beings, the \"ulti-mate\"project is the achievement-here or hereafter-of some religiOUS summum bonum. Religious statements, thus, cannot be ex-empted from the sort of checking procedures that must be applied to other kinds of truth -claims, and so some may not stand up to scrutiny. By the same token, however, just as ordinary truth-claims can be con-firmed or refuted through commonly accepted perceptual and inferential processes, so may religious claims. The door, therefore, is open to the secure establishment of the validity of this or that religion, as a result of which one ought to be able to conclude that the people who subscribe to the religion will, in fact, accomplish the goals de-scribed for them by the teachers and scriptures of the tradition. It is important to note that neither Dharmakirti nor most other religiously affiliated Indian logicians believed that the summum bonum described by a religiOUS tradition was actually accessible through rational argu-mentation-to achieve, e.g., nirvar;a, one had to enter the path and experience liberating insights directly-but they nevertheless felt great confidence that the existence of such a summum bonum was de-monstrable through argumentation. Whether the confidence of Dharmakirti and others, that logic and epistemology could settle truth-claims in all but the most hidden mat-ters, is justified or not is not for us to decide here.

Dharmakirti: Life, Work, and Influence Dharmakirti is not the first of the great Buddhist \"logicians\" -that dis-tinction is Dignaga's-but he is the most interesting for our purposes because it is he whose works form the basis of the study of logic and epis-temology in the various Tibetan schools and, most importantly, it was he who first attempted a systematic demonstration of the truth of such basic Buddhist assertions as the four noble truths and the supremacy of the Buddha's spiritual attainment. He did so in the Pramcl1Jasiddhi (\"Estab-lishment of Authority\") chapter of what is generally regarded as his magnum opus, the PramaIJavarttika (\"Commentary on Authority,\" or alter-natively, \"Commentary on [Dignaga's Compendium on] Authority\"). It is a translation of rGyal tshab rje's Tibetan commentary on the PramaIJasiddhi chapter that forms the main part of this book. As is the case with so many ancient Indians, we have little reliable historical information about Dharmakirti. There is general agreement that he lived during either the sixth or, more probably, seventh century C.E., but for details of his life, we must rely on the histories written in Tibetan by Bu ston rin chen grub (fourteenth century) and Taranatha (early seventeenth century), who had in turn to rely on a mixture of fact and legend in their reconstructions of the lost Indian past.1 According to the Tibetan histories, Dharmakirti was the son of a south Indian Brahmin philosopher. He was steeped early in the tradi-tional sciences and in Hindu thought, but was converted to Buddhism by reading Buddhist sastras while in his teens. He became a Buddhist layman (upasaka), and eventually travelled to northern India, where he received ordination as a monk from the acarya Dharmapala. Hewent on to study with a direct disciple of Dignaga, lsvarasena, who exposed him to Dignaga's masterwork, the PramaIJasamuccaya (\"Compendium 1 For English translations, see, respectively, Obermiller (1931-32) and Chat-topadhyaya (1970). Modern scholarship is divided on Dharmakirti's dafes. Long accepted was Frauwallner's (1961) suggestion of 600-660. Lindtner (1980) has recently suggested 530-600."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"110 Is Enlightenment Possible? on Authority\"). Dharmakirti quickly surpassed Isvarasena in his un-derstanding of the work, correcting many errors of interpretation. Isvarasena accepted Dharmakirti's superiority graciously, and asked him to write a definitive commentary on the Pramii1Jasamuccaya. This would be the Pramii1Javiirttika, very possibly the earliest and certainly the most important of the \"Seven Treatises on Authority\" attributed to Dharmakirti by Tibetan tradition. The others are the Pramii1Javiniscaya and Nyiiyabindu (both general treatises on logic and epistemology), along with the Hetubindu (on logical reasons), Sambandhapari~ii (on the relationship between logical reasons and predicates), Santiiniin-tarasiddhi (on perception and the problem of other minds) and Vadanyiiya (on debate technique).2 Dharmakirti became a renowned debater, dedicated enough to the refutation of his opponents that he supposedly lived for two years with the great MimaI!1saka Kumarila, disguised as a servant so as to learn his system and eventually defeat him in debate. He also is supposed to have defeated the Advaita Vedantin Sankara in three of the latter's incarnations-Sankara drowned himself in the Ganges after his first two defeats, and con-verted to Buddhism after the third. Had Dharmakirti been as great a debater as the legends suggest, Hinduism barely could have survived his onslaught. If his forensic leg-acy must be regarded with a bit of caution, there is no doubting the immense intellectual legacy he left the Buddhist philosophical tradi-tion, most importantly in his masterwork, the Pramii1Javiirttika. As noted above, it was written as a commentary on Dignaga's pioneering Pramii1Jasamuccaya. In fact, however, the Pramal).avarttika is far more than a gloss on Dignaga's work: it follows it only generally, and r~for­mulates old issues and raises new ones.31t is divided into four chapters 2 Of Dharmakirti's works, the PramaIJavarttika, Nyayabindu and Vddanyaya sur-vive in toto in Sanskrit.

There is some dispute as to the proper ordering of the chapters. Tibetan scholars accept the ordering just given, while the editors of recent Sanskrit editions have favored the ordering: establishment of authority, perception, inference for oneself and inference for the sake of others.4 The Sviirthanumiina chapter discusses the general structure and types of formal inference (or syllogism), and the apoha theory of meaning. The PramiiIJasiddhi chapter, with which this book is centrally concerned; seeks to define authority and to demonstrate that the Buddha, both because he is genuinely accomplished and because he speaks the truth, is uniquely authoritative for those intent on spiritual freedom. The Pratyak~a chapter establishes that there are two, and only two, sources of authoritative cognition (pramiiIJas), perception and inference, and goes on to discuss the four types of perception that are to be accepted (sensory, mental, apperceptive and yogic). The Pariirthii~umiina chapter discusses the ways in which logical reasons are correct or incorrect. Like many Indian Buddhist philosophers, Dharmakirti never gave an explicit name to his own philosophical standpoint. The tradition that has been most deeply influenced by him, the Tibetan, usually identifies him (as well as Dignaga) as a \"Cittamatrin ('mind-only-ist' = Yogacara,s a Mahayana school) Following Reasoning\" in contrast to such \"Cittamatrins Following Scripture\" (and positing a storehouse consciousness, iilaya vijiiiina) as Asanga and (in his later treatises) Vasubandhu.6 At the same time, some Tibetan writers on tenet-sys-tems (siddhiinta, T. grub mtha') specify that the Sautrantika-a Hinayana school-includes those who \"follow Dharmakirti's Seven Treatises on Valid Cognition.,,7 If Dharmakirti influenced Sautrantikas, might he have been one himself?

Thus, we find among modern scholars of Buddhism some who limit the term to an anti-ab-hidharma Hinayana tradition with no literary remains, others who insist that the school at least may be exemplified by Vasubandhu's Abhi-dharmakosabha~ya, and still others who define the school primarily in terms of the works of Dignaga and Dharmakirti.9 Nor are the Tibetans entirely in accord on the parameters of Sautrantika. Most agree that (a) no purely Sautrantika texts were translated into Tibetan and (b) that there were in India Sautrantikas who followed the style and outlook of Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakosabha~ya-though this need not entail that the text itself was Sautrantika. The dGe lugs pas assert, uniquely, that there also were in India Sautrantikas who followed the style and outlook of Dignaga and Dharmakirti-though presumably, as Hinayanists, they would ignore those elements of his writing that seemed too religiously Ma-hayanist or philosophically idealistic.10 What are we to make of this welter of views? Is Dharmakirti a Hinayanist or Mahayanist? Sautrantika or Cittamatrin? It is undeni-able that, with his predominant interest in logic and epistemology, he writes little that is suggestive of either the style or themes of the great Mahayana siitras or sastras, and that his one major description of Bud-dhist religious doctrines, in the PramaIJ-asiddhi chapter of the PramaIJ-avarttika, is largely in \"Hinayana\"terms, with external objects treated as real existents and arhantship (not omniscient buddhahood) posited as the goal of a path that is completed through the direct re-alization of no-self (as opposed to voidness, the more common Mahayana term). Further, the specific ways in which he explicates his religious and philosophical views, there and elsewhere, are quite close to those found in Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakosabha~ya-considered by all Tibetan traditions to represent the \"Sautrantika\"stangpoint. On the other hand, it is entirely possible that Dharmakirti may simply 8 See Singh (1984); d. Hayes (1986) for a highly critical review.

The view he defends, therefore, need not be his own in every detail. In-deed, Dharmakirti clearly holds views associated with Cittamatra, as, for instance, in the Pratyak~a chapter of the Pramiil.wviirttika (e.g., verses 320ff. and 532ff.), where he explicitly refers to the ultimate non-difference between the epistemic subject and the epistemic object, i.e., the true nature of reality as \"percept-only\" (vijfiaptimiitra).l1 Further-more-though this cannot be counted as strong evidence-Dharmakirti is said by the traditional histories to have been a tantric practitioner, appealing on one occasion to the deity Heruka for inspi-ration, and on another occasion reciting a powerful mantra in order to escape his house, which had been set afire by his opponents.12 Thus, if the denial of external objects is Cittamatrin (or Yogacara), and if Cit-tamatrin ideas (not to mention tantric practices!) are Mahayanist, then Dharmakirti must have been both a Cittamatrin and a Mahayanist. It still might be possible to argue that Dharmakirti is a Sautrantika if Sautrantika is defined in such a way that it does not exclude a mind-only perspective on reality, but this then would leave the problem of how \"Sautrantikas\"who did not accept mind-only could be covered by the term. The best solutions seem to be the acceptance either of the Tibetan idea that Dharmakirti is indeed a \"Cittamatrin Following Rea-soning'\" in effect a \"Sautrantika-Yogacara\" (in this case, assertion of mind-only is taken as definitive of Cittamatra) or the suggestion of some modern scholars13 that Dharmakirti, along with Dignaga, be as-Signed to an epistemologically oriented school of his own, the \"Pramiil.1aviida\" (in this case, assertion of the storehouse conscious-ness, as well as various cosmological and psychological speculations, is taken as definitive of Cittamatra). Whatever Dharmakirti's actual position, he came deeply to influ-ence late Indian Buddhist philosophy, both through his commentators and through those who made use of his theories for their own pur-poses, such as Svatantrika Madhyamikas, whose greatest representatives 11 For a persuasive discussion of this issue, see Dreyfus and Lindtner (1989). 12 Chattopadhyaya (1972) 230,235. It is curious that, if DharmakIrti really was a tantrika, we see this nowhere reflected in his writings, especially in his ac-counts of the rebirth process-a topic discussed extensively in tantric tradi-tions. 13 For instance, Warder (1971, 1980)."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"114 Is Enlightenment Possible? included Jnanagarbha, Santarak~ita and KamalaSila (all eighth cen-tury), and whose philosophical perspective combined a Madhyamika approach to ultimate reality with a Dharmaklrtian analysis of the con-ventional world.14 Partly through Svatantrika Madhyamika influence on early Tibetan scholasticism, Dharmaklrti would become the \"con-ventional\" philosopher par excellence for Tibetan tradition, too. IS The PramaIJavarttika was the most influential of Dharmaklrti's texts, and has received either direct or indirect commentary from almost every important Indian or Tibetan philosopher after Dharmakirti's time. Ironically, though, if the legends be believed, Dharmakirti despaired of finding any diSciple who could understand it. At the same time, Dharmaklrti himself composed a commentary to only one chapter of the Pramal.1avarttika, the svarthanumana (whether because it was the first chapter or the most difficult is uncertain). He permitted his most important disciple, Devendrabuddhi (ca. 630-690), to write a com-mentary on the other three chapters. Dissatisfied with the first draft, Dharmakirti effaced it with water; dissatisfied with the second, he burned it. He finally accepted the third draft, damning it with the rather faint praise that it did, at least, manage to convey the literal meaning-although it had missed the deeper significance.16 Deven-drabuddhi's Pafijika to the PramaIJavarttika was followed by the AlaJ?1kara (or Bha~ya) written by Prajnakaragupta (ca. 850?), who criti-cizes Devendrabuddhi's interpretations in a number of places and comments at length on the religious (particularly the Mahayana) im-plications of Dharmakirti's work. Devendrabuddhi and Prajnakaragupta are considered by Tibetan tradition to be the twin fountainheads of PramaIJavarttika commentary, an opinion that is borne out by the pro-liferation of sub-commentaries to their works: an extensive commentary on Devendrabuddhi's commentary was written by his disciple Sakyabodhi (who may also have studied directly with Dhar-makirti), and subcommentaries on Prajnakaragupta's by Ravigupta (ninth century?) and Yamari (eleventh century).17 14 See, e.g., Eckel (1987). 15 On the other hand, he has had very little influence in East ASian Buddhism, both because the texts that proved most influential in East Asia generally pre-date Dharmakirti, and (perhaps more arguably) because the forms of logical and epistemological analysis favored by later Indian Buddhists found little prece-dent-hence a cool reception-among East Asian Buddhists. 16 Chattopadhyaya (1972) 239. 17 For discussions of Dharmakirti's commentators, see Stcherbatsky (1962) 1,39-· 47 and Vidyabhusana (1978) II:II:III.

Basic Assumltions of Dharmaktrti s Thought As noted above, the Pramiil.1asiddhi chapter of the Pramii7J.aviirttika is de-voted to the\" establishment of authority,\" i.e., to establishing the definition of epistemic authority (pramii1'!a), and then to establishing that the Buddha is uniquely authoritative for those seeking spiritual libera-tion. The latter, in turn, is established through a demonstration that (a) the Buddha can, in fact, have achieved the supremely enlightened state that Buddhist tradition claims (this is shown in large part through a proof of the existence of a multitude of lives in which the necessary causes of enlightenment can be cultivated) and (b) the four noble truths, the core of the Buddha's teaching, are true (the bulk of the discussion here re-volves around a proof of the unique spiritual efficacy of the Buddhist insight into no-self). We also noted earlier that Dharmakirti, like others in the pramiil.1a tradition, was confident (a) that the development of generally ac-cepted inferential procedures assured that the\" correct cognition\" that necessarily preceded any successful human action could be securely grounded, and (b) that human religious knowledge could thus be grounded, strictly through chains of inferential reasoning that, in every case, would ultimately be founded on perceptions and principles common to all humans. One need not, therefore, appeal to principles or experiences unique to one's own religious tradition, for they were of little value in inter-traditional discussions and, furthermore, proof could be provided without them. In the Pramiil.1asiddhi chapter, there-fore, Dharmakirti does not try to demonstrate past and future lives by claiming that if they did not exist, there would be no strong foundation for the Buddhist notion of karma. Rather, he attempts to show that they are possible because the mind-body relation is such as to permit them. Similarly, he does not attempt to argue that the Buddhist insight into the no-self of persons has unique spiritual value because it is stated thus in Buddhist scripture, or because Buddhist meditators have thus experienced it. Rather, he frames a philosophical and psychologi-cal demonstration that belief in a self entails suffering, and that the elimination of that belief entails the elimination of suffering. Thus,"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"118 Is Enlightenment Possible? Dharmakirti is quite sensitive to the problems of what we today call \"philosophy of religion,\" and he strives to set forth an argument for the truth of Buddhist religious assertions that relies as little as possible on idiosyncratically Buddhist assumptions. There are, however, certain assumptions that inform the arguments in the PramalJasiddhi chap-ter-many of them demonstrated elsewhere in Dharmakirti's work or in the writings of other Buddhist philosophers-and it may be worth-while to note some of the more important ones. The assumptions that I will detail might cautiously be described as \"Sautrantika\" (as opposed to Cittamatrin)-though we must bear in mind the definitional difficulties described in the previous section. Be-fore we turn to these, however, something ought to be said about the assumptions borrowed by Dharmakirti from the pre-Sautrantika ab-hidharma tradition. It sometimes is assumed that because Sautrantikas generally are assumed to have been critical of aspects of the Vaibha~ika (or Sarvastivada) abhidharma, and gave much of their attention to logical and epistemological matters, that they \"rejected\" abhidharma categories. Quite to the contrary, however, Dharmakirti is heavily indebted to the abhidharmists who preceded him. Indeed, they gave him much of the \"language\"with which he describes reality. Thus, Dharmakirti makes the central assumption that-questions of their ultimate status as \"external\" or \"percept:-only\" notwithstand-ing-it is legitimate to describe the cosmos in terms of dharmas, elementary units of existence whose conjunction, opposition and in-teraction are the process we call the universe. The dharmas are like \"numbers\" in a universal equation that is, in fact, calculated in quasi-mathematical terms. Dharmas are divided in various ways, e.g., into conditioned (forms, cognitions, mental factors and non-associated compositional factors) and unconditioned (space and cessations, in-cluding nirvar:a), or the five aggregates (matter, sensation, recognition, formations and cognition), or the twelve \"entrances\" (ayatanas: six faculties and six objects), or the eighteen fields (dhatus; six faculties, six objects and six cognitions). The sphere of the physical (or \"form\": rnpa) is divisible into the five \"elements\" (bhUta): earth, water, fire, air and ether (or \"space\"). The sphere of the mental is de-scribed in terms of (a) the primary, bare cognitions (citta) through which an. object is initially apprehended and (b) the constellation of mental factors (caitta), some fixed and some variable, th'\\t give a par-ticular quality, or tone, to a mental moment.1 1 Discussions of these basic categories can be found in most basic works on"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Basic Assumptions ofDharrnaklrti's Thought 119 The central doctrine of Dharmakirti's ontology is the theory of mo-mentariness, whereby the \"objective\" and \"continuous\" world we believe we experience is actually a subsequent imposition onto the ac-tual nature of things, which truly is discontinuous events (k~a1Ja) of infinitesimal extension and duration. The theory of momentariness is closely connected with two even more fundamental Buddhist asser-tions, impermanence and no-self, of both of which it is in a sense a corollary. The theory seems to have arisen among the Sautrantikas, at least in part as a critique of the Vaibha~ika account of impermanence, which divided an \"event\" into moments of arising, subsistence, decay and cessation. According to the Sautrantikas, such a description makes a mockery of the notion of a momentary event, which ought by definition to be irreducible. Furthermore, if such a division is made, then it might be argued that each of an event's sub-moments also ought to be thus divisible, and 50, on, in infinite regress. The Sautran-tikas arrive at their own theory through a forceful application of the law of the excluded middle, maintaining that phenomena must be ut-terly permanent or utterly impermanent. In other words, if events are granted the slightest duration, then there is no reason to believe that they ever would cease, for duration would be their nature, and thus in-eradicable. Thus, their duration must be no duration, or, rather, a duration so brief that an event's cessation is virtually simultaneous with its arising. To allow duration is to open the door for permanence, and where there is permanence-a subsisting self, or atman-there can be no change. Manifestly, the world is one in which change ob-tains, so, finally, the world only can be explained on the basis of momentariness.2 The most common criticism of the theory of momentariness (as of the theory of no-self, aniitman) is that it makes causality unintelligible, since causality implies some sort of continuity, while the momentary events posited by the Buddhist are discontinuous. The Buddhist re-sponse is that momentariness does not vitiate causality, because every Buddhist philosophy, e.g., Warder (1980), Stcherbatsky (1970), Sopa and Hop-kins (1976) and The Dalai Lama (1985). 2 The most complete account of the doctrine of momentariness remains that of Stcherbatsky (1962) I, 79-203, though as both Zwilling (1975) and Klein (1986 [29-30]) have pointed out, Stcherbatsky's interpretation of the Sautrantika notion of ultimate truth is open to criticism for his failure to consider that composite impermanent objects may have as much \"reality\" as the\" events\" that compose them.

Just as the smallest particles known to physiCS are hard to distinguish on an ulti-mate level, and yet are the basis of the diverse world we know, so too the momentary events posited by Buddhism are difficult to charac-terize in their barest sense, and yet they combine in different ways to form the composites of the known world. We know these composites to have particular characteristics and causal efficiency, and logical rigor demands that the elements out of which composites are made be of a non-contradictory nature. Therefore, momentary events must be efficient and have particular characteristics, and so causality must, in fact,obtain.3 For a proponent of momentariness, then, the apparently continu-ous \"things\" that we observe in everyday life are, in fact, series of infinitesimal events, in which an event of a particular type lasts but the shortest instant, to be replaced in the next instant by an event of a similar type. Each event in a series is both the effect of the event (and other cooperative-condition events) that preceded it, and the cause (along with other cooperative-condition events) of the event that suc-ceeds it. A \"seed\"or a \"jar,\"then, is not a continuous thing, but a series of seed-events or jar-events, in which the \"continuity\"is provided by a \"constant\"constellation of causes and conditions. The \"changes\"we describe on the macroscopic level, then, simply are changes in the constellation of events. A seed actually \"becomes\" a sprout in infinitesimal increments through subtle shifts in the effect on the seed of such conditions as moisture and sunlight. A jar is \"destroyed\"when 3 At PV Pratyak~a:3 and SOb-SIb, Dharmaklrti intimates that whatever is efficient, or able to perfonn a function, is (a) ultimately existent and (b) pos-sessed of an own -mark. This, of course, leaves open the question of whether efficient, \"own-marked\"phenomena are just momentary events (as main-tained by Stcherbatsky and a number of TIbetan-especially rNying rna pa-commentators) or also include impermanent composites such as are encountered in \"everyday\"perception (as maintained by the dGe lugs pas).

From the earliest abhidharma treatises, Buddhists have attempted to enumerate and classify the various causes and conditions that apply in different causal situations. These hetus and pratyayas have varied in number and distribution from system to system. I will not discuss here all the causes and conditions posited by Dharmakirti, but will touch only on his general definition of a cause and those specific causes and conditions that are central to his arguments. In general terms, Dhar-makirti views a cause negatively as that factor in the absence of which a result cannot arise, and positively as that factor a variation in which will assure a variation in the result. His specific discussions seem to presuppose a basic division into, on the one hand, the entity under discussion, which is a result of a homogeneous substantial cause, and the cooperative conditions that contribute to its generation. The upadlina hetu (or kara1Ja) is, literally, the\" obtaining cause,\"but it is bet-ter characterized as the\" substantial cause,\" for it is that\" substance\" or entity-moment whose disappearance or \"transformation\" is followed in the next moment by an event of the same type, which is designated as the substantial result. Thus, on the microscopic level, a seed-event is the substantial cause of the seed-event that-conditions permit-ting-follows it; on the macroscopic level, a seed is the substantial cause of a sprout, or milk of butter. Sahakliriya pratyayas are the \"co-operative\" conditions that aid in the generation of a given result, either macroscopic (the transformation of the seed into a sprout) or micro-scopic (the moment-to-moment \"existence\" of the seed). Cooperative conditions may be either indispensable (as in the case of, e.g., the adhipatipratyaya, the principal condition) or assistant (upaklirya). In-dispensable cooperative conditions are those conditions in the absence of which a substantial cause cannot generate its result. Sun-light and moisture are indispensable to a seed's generation of a sprout, because without them there can be no sprout. Assistant cooperative conditions are those conditions that may contribute toward a particu-lar result, but are not essential to it. In the case of the generation of a sprout, assistant cooperative conditions might include, e.g., the par-ticular mineral content of the soil, extra watering done by the farmer, particular methods of planting, etc. It might be noted parenthetically that Dharmakirti's discussion of the mind-body problem revolves"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"122 Is Enlightenment Possible? around his attempt to show that the body is neither the substantial cause nor an indispensable condition of the mind, but is merely an as-sistant condition. One further aspect of Dharmakirti's theory of causality worth men-tioning, especially for its importance in discussions of the mind-body problem, is his insistence that an entity's substantial cause must be \"homogeneous\" (svajati) with it, i.e., of the same \"type.\"Thus, a seed-event only can be preceded by a seed-event; it cannot be preceded by a jar-event (although it may be contained within a jar-event!). By the same token, Dharmakirti will argue, a mind-event simply cannot be generated by an event fundamentally different from it in nature, i.e., a body-event, which is even more different from a mind-event (the one being physical, the other not) thana jar-event is from a seed-event (both of which are material). The insistence on the homogeneity of causal series is an attempt to insure that there is an orderliness to cau-sality such that causes and effects remain compatible. The insistence on homogeneity, incidentally, does not, as it may first appear, rule out \"novelty\"in the universe, for what we describe as \"novelty,\" a Buddhist simply will call a compatible homogeneous transformation (where the lines of compatibility are to be drawn, then, becomes a further issue to be decided).4 How, then, do we come to know the world thus described, with its momentary events coordinated according to discernible causal laws? We know it through valid cognitions, those epistemic authorities known to the Indians as pramafJas. Enumerations of types of authority vary in Indian philosophy from the one (perception) of some materi-alists to the eleven of the Vai§e~ika thinker Caraka. Dharmakirti, like other Sautrantikas and most Buddhists, accepts only two authorities: perception (pratyakf?a) and inference (anumana). The argument against counting such means of knowledge as testimony, comparison and ne-gation as authorities is that they actually can be subsumed under inference. Testimony, for instance, is not an independent source of knowledge, but actually induces knowledge in us throught the follow-ing inferential process: x must be true, because y says so, where y is known (probably through inductive generalization) to be authorita-tive on subjects like x. Knowledge arrived at through comparison also is inferential, for when we see for the first time an x that we have been told is like a y that we already know, we must infer not only that what 4 For accounts of Buddhist causal theory, see, e.g., Stcherbatsky (1962) I:II:II, Kalupahana (1976), Mookerjee (1980) I:I-V and Karunadasa (1967)."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Basic Assumptions ofDharmakirti's Thought 123 we see is similar to y, but that the speaker of the comparison is a reli-able source. The knowledge of negation, similarly, must involve an inference, for an absence cannot be known directly, but, rather, is in-ferred from a change in the constellation of what is present. 5 Dharmakirti regards authoritative perception as a non-deceptive cognition that is free from any conceptual construction. Perceptions are of four types. (1)' A sense perception (pratyak~a) directly cognizes a sensory object (form, sound, smell, taste, tangible) through the me-dium of a sense-faculty (indriya: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body). (2) A mental perception (mcmasa pratyak~a) is, in most people, a brief non-conceptual, non-sensory perception that follows upon and cognizes the object of a previous moment of sense perception. Also counted as mental perceptions are instances of extra-sensory perception, such as clairvoyance, clairaudience, retrocognition, telepathy, etc. (3) An ap-perceptive perception (svasarrvedanii pratya~a) is a perception of perception: each perception has a substantially identical concomitant perception that perceives it, thereby enabling the Sautrantika to ex-plain how perceptions can he remembered. (4) Yogic perceptions (yogi pratyak~a) are the direct \"realizations\" of aryas, who perceive a salvific truth (e.g., the four noble truths or no-self) and thereby begin to up-root defilements from their mindstreams. It is useful to remember that \"the mind,\"just like a material object, is for Buddhists composed of a quantifiable, qualifiable constellation of events: at the \"center\" is a \"principal mind,\" or bare cognition (citta), \"around\"which are arrayed various mental factors (caitta), some ever-present (such as sensation, dis-cernment, intention, contact and attention), others variable (such as various positive and negative mental attitudes). The least commonly accepted of the four types of perception is ap-perception, which is rejected even by a majority of Buddhist schools (let alone by non-Buddhists) on the grounds that a perception is by nature \"subjective,\" and cannot, thus, ever become an object. Mental perception (especially of the extra-sensory type) and yogic perception are accepted by all Buddhists and by most non-Buddhists, as well. Most Hindu schools agree that mental and material events can be per-ceived without direct sensory contact, and most agree, too, that there exists a kind of perception-usually the direct realization of a key re-ligious or philosophical principle-that can serve as the basis of 5 On the numbers and types of inference, see, e.g., PV Pratya~a:lff. and NB 1:2-3. On the question of the knowledge of absences, see, e.g., Klein (1985), chap-ters 5-7, 9."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"124 Is Enlightenment Possible? spiritual liberation. Both mental and yogic perceptions vary from tra-dition to tradition, however, and they are not (for all their authoritativeness within a tradition) the sort of perceptions that can be accepted as independent evidence for truth-claims made on the basis of them. Dharmakirti, thus, does not appeal to them, for some of his op-ponents will disagree With the conclusions drawn from such experiences, while others (the materialists) will deny that such perceptions can be veridical. The one type of perception to which appeal can be made with confidence, then, is sense-perception. Sense-perception, for a Sautran-tika, begins with an instant of direct sensory perception. This is followed by an instant (usually unnoticed) of direct mental perception, and then by a \"subsequent\"sense-perception that still is direct, but no longer is an authority, since it does not ascertain its object inde-pendently, but in the wake of the initial direct perception. Moments following the subsequent direct perception no longer involve directly apprehending the object. Rather, such moments involve the appre-hension of a \"generic image\" (* arthasamanya, T. don spyi) of the object, and hence mental construction-which cannot be involved in any kind of perception.6 The second authority, inference, is said by Dharmakirti to be a proc-ess of reasoning from an evident particular (e.g., there is smoke on the hill) to a non-evident particular (there is fire on the hill) by way of a generally ac(epted principle of concomitance (where there's smoke, there's fire). In other words, one establishes a particular predicate in a particular subject through knowledge of a particular reason that has particular relation to the subject and a general relation of causality or synonymy to the predicate. Unlike perception, inference involves con-ceptual construction, and because it involves apprehension of general principles, i.e., universals, it proceeds at least in part on the basis of negative apprehension, for Buddhists in general reject the existence of real \"universals,\" claiming that we come to know class characteristics of particular phenomena through the\" exclusion of what is other than\" the class characteristic in question, a process known as apoha. By thus arguing that we know a particular entity to be, e.g., a cow through an instantaneous process of excluding everything that is not a cow, the Buddhist is able to avoid claiming-as do, for instance, the Nyaya-6 On perception, see, e.g., Stcherbatsky (1962) I:II:III and II, 1-47, Mookerjee (1980) chapters XVII-XXI, Rabten (1978) 11-17 and Lati Rinbochay (1980) 49-75.

The Buddhist rejection of universals is closely related to a theory of \"meaning,\"whereby words denote entities not by virtue of some abso-lutely inherent relation, but rather by a kind of indirection: words exclude everything but the entity intended by the speaker. Because there is no absolute relation between word and object, the existence of a word need not entail the existence of its (or any!) object, as it does in naively realistic theories of meaning. On the other hand, the fact that a word expresses an entity at least indirectly means that there is some relation that obtains, and that Buddhism therefore avoids extreme nominalism.7 Indeed, it is important to recognize that for Dharmakirti and for most Buddhist epistemologists following him, inferences are\" ef-fected by the force of actual entities,\" or \"objectively impelled\" (vastubalapravrtta), and thus grounded in \"actuality\" or \"the way things re-ally are\"(bhiltatii, T. gnas lugs). The actual inferential procedure accepted by Dharmakirti is the same as outlined above in chapter eight: subject is predicate, because reason, as in accordant example, unlike in non-accordant example, where the reason is relevant to the subject and positively and nega-tively concomitant with the predicate. Dharmakirti also specifies three ways in which a reason can be fallacious: as unproven (asiddha), where it is not relevant to the subject; as uncertain or inconclusive (anaikiin-tika), where its positive and negative concomitance with the predicate is doubtful; and as contradictory (viruddha), where it directly contra-dicts the predicate. There are other topics covered by Dharmakirti in his many discussions of inference, e.g., the classification of reasons into those based on causality, synonymy or negation; and elaborations on the ways in which reasons can be fallacious. Some of these will arise in the course of the translation, and will be dealt with there; for now, a general understanding of the structure of syllogism and the marks of cor-rect and incorrect reasons should suffice. These, then, are the major philosophical underpinnings of Dhar-maklrti's arguments in the Pramiil.1asiddhi chapter of the PramaIJavarttika. It ought to be noted again that there are no real religious assumptions 7 On apoha, see Shah (1967) chapter III, Zwilling (1976), Stcherbatsky (1962) II, Appendix V and Mookerjee (1980) chapter vn.

Thus, although Dharmaki:rti works with a \"lowest-common-denominator\" description of the Buddhist path as a progression from delusion to enlightenment through the direct, salvific realization of a critical principle (no-self), he sets out to demonstrate-and does not pre-suppose-that the path can succeed. And, although his arguments presuppose the truth of the doctrine of no-self (indeed, they rest upon it: \"all human accomplishment is preceded by correct cognition\"), no-self presumably can be demonstrated by independent reasoning.

Dignaga's Pramii1Jasamuccaya, yet in many ways goes beyond the original, so the Pramii7Jasiddhi chapter begins from Dignaga, yet is entirely Dhar-makirti's. Indeed, the departure from the Pramii7Jasamuccaya is perhaps most marked in the case of the Pramii7Jasiddhi chapter, for its 287 complex slokas comment on just one verse of Dignaga's text, the first: To the one who has become an authority, the one who desires to benefit beings, the teacher, the sugata (\"well-gone\"), the sav-ior, I bow down. In order to establish authority, I make here a single compendium of my various scattered writings.1 The greater part of the Pramii1Jasiddhi chapter is, in fact, devoted to explicating just the first half of the verse, for it is there that Dignaga lists the five epithets of the Buddha that provide Dharmakirti with the framework of his arguments: (1) the one who has become an authority (pramii1Jabhiita), (2) the one who desires to benefit beings (jagadhi-tai~in), or, alternatively, the compassionate one (dayiivan), (3) the teacher (siistr), (4) the sugata and (5) the savior (lit., \"protector,\"tiiyin). Dharmakirti's primary purpose in the Pramii1Jasiddhi chapter is to demonstrate that the Buddha is an authority for those intent on spiri-tual freedom, or liberation. To do so, he first must define authority, then show how the Buddha fulfills the definition. To demonstrate that the Buddha fulfills the definition, he shows the cause of his authorita-tiveness, namely the way in which his attainment of buddhahood ':Vas 1 pramiilJilbhUtiiya jagadhitai~ine pranamya sastre sugataya tiiyine / pramiiT}asiddhyai svamatiit samuccaya~ kari~ate viprasrtad ihaikata~.

This demonstration entails showing that the Buddha is the compassionate one, and that therefore he is the teacher, the sugata and the savior. To demonstrate why the Buddha fulfills the definition of authority, Dharmakirti establishes that he is qualified to be the savior, and that therefore he is the sugata, the teacher and the compassionate one. The demonstration of the cause of the Buddha's authoritativeness, much of which is devoted to proving that there exist a multiplicity of lives in which compassion can be \"accustomated,\" was called by later commentators the \"forward system of explanation.\" The demonstration of the reason for the Buddha's authoritativeness, most of which is devoted to a proof of the four noble truths (especially the truth of path), is known as the \"reverse system of explanation.,,2 Though Dignaga undertook n? extensive discussion of the five epi-thets such as Dharmakirti would attempt, he does seem to have been generally aware of their implications. He indicates in his own com-mentary to the first ver~e of the PramiiIJasamuccaya that the latter four epithets (compassionate one, teacher, sugata and savior), which are probative of the fact that the Buddha is the one who has become an authority (the first epithet), correspond to a set of \"excellences\" (sam-pat) that a buddha develops. Generally, a buddha possesses excellence of causes (hetu) and excellence of results (phala). These, then, are sub-divided into the four excellences that correspond to the last four epithets. Excellence of causes includes excellence of intention (asaya), i.e., the Buddha's compassionate intention to assist all beings, and ex-2 There is some disagreement as to precisely which verses are covered by the forward system and which by the reverse. Nagatomi ([1959] 266, note 26) holds that the forward system covers the entire chapter through verse 281 (= Miyasaka's 279), the reverse system only verses 282-285a (280-283a). Tibet-ans, by and large, believe that the reverse system begins atverse 146b, with the discussion of the four noble truths. This system has been presented by Inami and Tillemans (1986), following dGe 'dun grub pa. The point at issue is whether the long proof of the four noble truths is the last argument in the for-ward system or the first in the reverse. I tend to side with the Tibetans in hold-ing the former. Since Dharmakirti sees compassionate one, teacher, sugata and savior as terms in an inferential chain, it is vital for him to prove the first epi-thet in each sequence in detail; the others then follow easily. Thus, the forward system is rooted in the proof of \"compassionate one,\"proof of which takes up much of the first part of the chapter. The reverse system is rooted in \"savior,\" which is a characteristic of the Buddha because of his knowledge of the four noble truths. The correctness of these, then, must be proved in detaiL as Dhar-makirti attempts to do from verses 146b-280a. Dharmakirti's arguments as a . whole are summarized in greater detail in R.

Excellence of results is divided into excellence of one's own aims (svartha) and excellence of others' aims (parartha). The former is the Buddha's sugatahood, his complete liberation from sa1!lsara; the latter is his status as savior, both willing and able to show others the way to liberation.3 Schematized, the excellences and epi-thets appear thus: the Buddha I one who has become an authority excellence of causes excellence of results intention application compassionate one teacher own aims sugata others' aims savior The excellences and epithets that, for Dignaga, simply indicate the Bud-dha's superiority are, for Dharmakirti, the basis of an ambitious attempt systematically to prove the truth of the Buddhist world-view. In order to prove in a general way that the Buddha merits the epi-thet \"one who has become an authority,\" Dharmakirti first must define authority. Authority, he argues, is awareness that is: (1) nonde-ceptive, Le., uncontradicted by either perception or valid inference; (2) cognitive, Le., a mental act rather than the activity of, e.g., some sense-faculty; and (3) new, Le., a cognition that draws certainty to-ward its object independently rather than on the basis of a previous authoritative cognition.4 Having established a definition of authority, Dharmakirti turns to non-existent and existent examples of beings who may be authoritative for those intent on freedom. The negative instance is furnished by the Hindu (especially Nyaya-Vaise~ika) con-3 See Nagatomi (1959) and van Bijlert (1989) for discussions of Dignaga's auto-commentary. 4 PV (Miyasaka ed.)

It ought to be noted that verse references here are to the Sanskrit, while those in the translation are to the TIbetan, so there may be some discrepancy in line-lettering, since the Sanskrit verse usually is divided into two lines (a and b), while the TIbetan is divided into four (a, b, c and d)."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"130 Is Enlightenment Possible? cept of isvara, a permanent, omniscient creator God. Dharmakirti demonstrates that such an entity cannot be authoritative because authority entails cognition, and cognition, being of the impermanent, cannot be predicated of a permanent entity. Furthermore, isvara can-not be proven to be the creator of the phenomenal world, because (a) . his permanence makes interrelation with the impermanent impossi-ble and (b) arguments for his creatorship, such as the Indian version of the argument from design, are logically flawed, since the J( creation\" of the world cannot be shown to be analogous to the creation of a hu-man artifact, such as a pot. In fact, isvara is a superfluous concept, unnecessary for explicating the known world, the Buddhist concepts of karma and dependent origination being perfectly adequate to the task.s The positive instance of an authoritative being is the Buddha, who is generally known to be thus because he, uniquely, knows what is to be rejected (ignorance and other saI!1saric defilements) and what is to be adopted (the path to nirva~a, at whose core is the realization of no-self) by those intent on spiritual freedom. Whether or not the Buddha's authoritativeness extends to an omniscient cognition of all objects of knowledge is, here at least, moot; what makes him authori-tative is his direct, experientially verified knowledge of what is to be done or shunned by a religious practitioner.6 Dharmakirti next turns to a specific demonstration (via the forward system of explanation) of the way in which the Buddha could and did become an authority. He seeks first to prove that the Buddha is the compassionate one. To do so, he must establish that the extraordinary compassion possessed by a buddha really can be \"accustomated,\" or developed. Extraordinary compassion really can be developed only if there exists a multiplicity of lives in which to develop it. Dharmakirti realizes, in turn, that a multiplicity of lives is possible only if the mind-body relation is such as to permit it. He therefore seeks to show that a materialism that reduces the mental to the physical is flawed, and that the true mind-body relation is what in the West would be called an in-teractionist dualism, whereby mind and body both are causal entities, and therefore capable of at least indirect interaction, but substantially different enough that the physical cannot be the substantial cause or indispensable condition of the mental, as they are not invariably con-5 Pramanasiddhi:3-28; see below, section III:2:B.

Dharmakirti analyzes a number of materialist attempts to argue that mind depends upon an invariably concomitant physical ba-sis, and finds that neither the sense-faculties (whether severally or individually), nor the body (whether as a whole or partially), nor at-oms (whether collectively or individually), nor breaths (whether permanent or impermanent) are thus concomitant. The physical, therefore, may serve as an assistant condition of the mind, but cannot be its substantial cause or indispensable condition. Events only can arise out of previous events of the same type, so the basis of mind must be previous mind. Thus, the first mind-moment of this life must have been preceded by a previous mind-moment, which must have been in a past life, and the last mind-moment of this life-if still domi-nated by self-grasping-will be succeeded by a mind-moment that will be in a subsequent life. Rebirth thus is proved, and with it (a) the general concept of salTlsara, the reality of which is required for nirvar:a to be fully meaningful and (b) the multiplicity of lives in which an as-piring buddha may develop extraordinary compassion.7 Dharmakirti completes his discussion of the Buddha's status as compassionate one by replying to charges that, even if there are many lives, compassion may be \"naturally limited,\" like human jumping ability, or boiling water. He argues in response that compassion (and, by implication, other virtues, such as wisdom) differs from the physical examples cited by the opponent, and need not be limited, because it has a stable basis, namely a non-material, concentrated mind, and therefore can increase cumulatively-and even geometrically.8 The Buddha's compassion prompts him in turn to seek an antidote to the suffering of others. He realizes that he can provide only an an-tidote that he himself has tested and validated, so he comes into possession of the teaching, literally \"the teacher,\"that is the antidote: the wisdom directly realizing no-self. This wisdom enables one actu-ally to uproot the defilements that perpetuate one's stay in salTlsara, and when developed to the fullest, it issues in liberation. The Buddha's liberation, his absence of any and all defiling tendencies, is his sugata-hood. Sugatahood is glossed by Dharmakirti as entailing goodness (for it represents the true uprooting of all defilements, hence the high-est good), irreversibility (for one who has attained it never will lapse 7 Pramanasiddhi:34-119; see below, section III:3-4.Cf. also Jha (1937-39) vol.

Understanding the antidote that has re-sulted in his own spiritual\" cure,\" and desiring to benefit others, the Buddha is prompted to pass on what he knows. He is able to in such a way that others follow in his wake, and therefore he is fit to be consid-ered the savior. 9 Since \"all human accomplishment is preceded by correct cogni-tion,\" the Buddha's attainment (traced causally in the forward system of explanation) can be real, and his authoritativeness assured, only if what he teaches is, in fact, true, i.e., if he really has correctly cognized the nature and solution of the problem of saJ.!lsara. Thus, there arises the question of the validity of the Buddha's central teaching, the four noble truths. The truth of suffering involves a description of the nature of saJ.!lsara. The truth of origination describes the causes of the resul-tant suffering analyzed by the first truth. The truth of cessation asserts the existence of a purified, nirvaI).ic state that transcends saJ.!lsara. The truth of path describes what must be known and done in order to ef-fect the cessation described by the third truth. A demonstration that these four propositions are true should clinch the argument that the Buddha is worthy of being regarded as \"the one who has become an authority\" by those intent on freedom, so Dharmakirti sets out to prove the four noble truths in order.lo The truth of suffering is proven (a) through identifying suffering with the five aggregates that, without control, take birth after birth in saJ.!lsara and (b) by showing that the suffering experienced by sentient beings cannot be explained strictly in physical terms (e.g., as an imbal-ance among the bodily humors, or as changes in one's physical elements), but must be seen as stemming from mental causes. The discus-sion of the truth of suffering, therefore, dovetails with the earlier demonstration of interactionist dualism as the mind-body relation; some of the earlier arguments may be applied here, and some of the arguments adduced here may be applied to the earlier discussion. The general outlook is the same: the physical cannot be shown to be the invariably concomitant basis of the mental-which only can be based on homogeneous causes.ll 9 Pramanasiddhi:132-146a; see below, section III:5:B. 10 This is' the section of the PramalJasiddhi chapter translated into German by Vetter (1984). 11 PramalJasiddhi:147-179a; see below, section III:7."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Dhannakirti's Defense of the Buddhist World-View 133· The truth of origination is proven through an examination of the way in which ignorance and craving function together to generate the suffering we universally experience. Ignorance is the fundamental cause: the ignorant belief in the existence of a self of persons, and the ignorant belief that future pleasures or rebirths somehow will entail an improvement over present sufferings. This ignorance leads to the \"efficient\" cause of suffering and suffering rebirths: craving, whether for sense-pleasure, existence, or annihilation. Quite simply, the pres-ence or absence of craving in a being's mindstream determines whether or not conditions are ripe for a suffering result to arise.12 The truth of cessation is proven at least partially by the fact that if there exists an identifiable cause originating suffering, then, given the general validity of the notion of dependent origination, the elimina-tion of that cause ought to entail the elimination of the resultant suffering. Dharmakirti also answers various criticisms raised against Buddhist arhants, e.g., that they are subject to desire or anger, or that their liberation is reversible. The question of the reversibility of libera-tion is crucial, for if liberation is reversible, then the truth of cessation-,-which asserts a complete stopping of suffering-is untrue. rGyal tshab rje will expand on Dharmakirti's discussion by arguing that liberation (hence cessation) is possible because the direct realiza-tion of no-self entails generation of a recognition that is both true and profound. Because it is true (and rGyal tshab rje adduces arguments for its truth, drawn from Madhyamaka), it can precede religious ac-complishment. Because it is profound, direct realization of it has a power that simply does not permit the arising of the contradictory view, namely that there is a self. In the absence of this view, defile-ments simply cannot arise, and they do not.13 The truth of path is proven primarily through a discussion of the salvific value of the realization of no-self. Dharmakirti first argues that the mind is clear and cognitive by nature, capable of accurately appre-hending objects, and that an accurate, or true, representation of an object, once established, cannot be supplanted. Once it is firmly estab-lished, then, the realization of no-self-given that it is true~cannot be supplanted by its contradictory. Therefore, it is the antidote to sarp.saric suffering; it is the path to nirvaJ}.a.14Its value as a path, how-ever, must be upheld not only against those who deny the possibility 12 PramCinasiddhi:179b-190a; see below, section III:8. 13 PramCinasiddhi:190b-205ai see below, section III:9. 14 PramCi~asiddhi:205b-226a; see below, sections ill:10:A-B.

Dhar-makirti, therefore, undertakes detailed refutations of a number of these alternative paths. He argues, against such Hindu schools as the Vai§e~ika, SaI;1khya and (perhaps) Vedanta, that the attempt to disas-sociate one's perfect, unchanging self (whether it be called atman or puru~a) from the defiled, changing body and/or cosmos cannot suc-ceed, in part because the concept of such a self is unproven, in part because desire for such a self inevitably will turn into selfish desire, and thus will entail the generation of defilements. IS He argues against such theist and/or ritualist traditions as the Nyaya that neither divine injunctions nor rituals for which one has been empowered can possi-bly serve to uproot the myriad afflictions suffered by sentient beings; indeed, they are more likely to perpetuate them.16 Finally, he argues against the Jainas that self-mortification and oth'er forms of austerity cannot be the basis of liberation because such activities seek to elimi-nate either karma or the body, which may be causes contributing to suffering, but are not (as ignorance and craving are) the real key to it. Austerities, therefore, may eliminate particular sufferings, or particu-lar karmic seeds, but they do not attack the problem at the root.17 With the four noble truths thus proven, the Buddha has been shown to be a savior, for he teaches truths that are conducive to salvation. A savior must teach from experience, so the Buddha must have com-pleted the path he teaches; he must, therefore, be a sugata. If he is a sugata, he must have developed to the fullest the antidote to suffering, the \"teacher\"that is the wisdom realizing no-self. He will have found and developed the antidote only if he had a motive for doing so. His motive was compassion which, developed through countless lives, in-duced him to discover the teacher/antidote that he could test on himself and-when he had validated it through becoming the sugata-pass on to others as the savior. IS Thus, Dharmakirti has shown to his own satisfaction, and to the satisfaction of generations of Indian and Tibetan Buddhists, that the Buddha is, indeed, the one who has become an authority for those in-tent on freedom, for (a) he has been shown to possess the necessary causes of such authoritativeness and (b) his analysis of those causes 15 Prama/fasiddhi:226b-257a; see below, sections III:I0:C-1l:A. 16 Pramanasiddhi:257b-273a; see below, section III:ll:B. 17 Pramanasiddhi:273b-280a: see below, section III:1l:C. 18 Prama~asiddhi:280b-283a: see below, section III:12."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Dhannakirti's Defense of the Buddhist World-VieuJ 135 has been shown to be true.

On Evaluatin~ D harmaklrti s Arguments I have already said that I do not intend to enter here into a detailed evalu-ation of Dharmakirti's arguments in defense of the Buddhist world-view. On the other hand, many readers undoubtedly will want to evaluate the arguments for themselves, whether out of personal or philosophical in-terest, so it seems worthwhile at least briefly to discuss some of the problems faced by anyone attempting such an evaluation. The first question that must be asked is whether such an evaluation even is pOSSible. Is not the Indian (or Tibetan) philosophical context so different from our own that any attempt on our part to evaluate Bud-dhist arguments will fail virtually by definition? Obviously, there are great differences between the cultural contexts and philosophical lan-guage-systems of the Indo-Tibetan and Western traditions. One must, as a Westerner approaching Asian texts, remain as sensitive as possi-ble to these differences, being careful to evaluate unfamiliar arguments in their own terms as much as possible, while importing one's own instinctive prejudices as little as pOSSible. At the same time, I do not think that such an evaluation is in principle impossible.We al-ready have seen that the logically inclined tradition of which Dharmakirti was a part rested its discussions primarily on common perception and formal inference, and that its criteria of validity, there-fore, did not differ, so greatly as to be incomprehensible, from the criteria applied by Western philosophers. Indeed, we have seen that the Indian Buddhist formal inference can tentatively be translated into Aristotelian terms. Furthermore, Indian philosophers in general and Buddhists in particular have invited evaluation: they are convinced that their argumentative procedures are universally comprehensible and applicable, and that anyone who takes the time to understand the principles involved will be able to follow-and eventually agree to-the arguments proffered. They make their arguments seriously, and we owe it to them to take them seriously.! Once we have agreed that arguments such as Dharmakirti's can be evaluated, however cautiously, we face the problem of how we are to go about the evaluation. ft seems to me that there are three different"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"138 Is Enlightenment Possible? levels on which evaluation must be made: (1) the level of the argu-ments themselves, where we must ask: are they compelling in the light of the logical canons accepted by Indian philosophers?; (2) the level of the assumptions informing the discussion, where we must ask: are the Buddhist ontological and epistemological doctrines presup-posed by Dharmakirti, and undergirding his discussion, valid? and (3) the level of the whole epistemological exercise, where we must ask: are logic and epistemology in fact sufficiently grounded in certainty to permit us to base generally valid ontological statements upon them? We will consider each of these problems briefly in turn. (1) Dharmakirti's actual arguments must be evaluated by examin-ing whether they violate any of the logical canons described earlier, in section 8, Le., whether they are properly constructed inferences to which any reasonable person ought to assent because (a) the reason is correct in all three respects, (b) the rules of argumentation regarding question-begging, circularity, infinite regress, etc., are respected and (c) the fundamental axioms of Indian philosophy regarding causality, existence and non-existence are upheld. Though much of Dhar-makirti's discussion does follow these canons, there are at least two general types of problem that may arise, with respect to (a) hidden as-sumptions and (b) representation of opponents'positions. (a) Two of the central arguments in the Pramcl1;asiddhi chapter are, first, the refutation of materialism and establishment of an interac-tionist dualism as the mind-body relation and, second, the demonstration of the salvific power of the direct realization of no-self. These two arguments comprise nearly two-thirds of the chapter, and clearly are crucial to Dharmakirti's case. In each instance, however, it is possible to argue that Dharmakirti may have imported assumptions not shared by all of his readers. In his mind-body discussion, at least part of his argument seems to be that mind and body cannot be as closely related causally as claimed by the materialist because they ob-viouslyare different types of entity, the one subjective and immaterial, the other objective and material (not entirely unlike Descartes' res cogitans and res extensa). There clearly is such a fundamental difference in common-sense experience and parlance, and yet is not the whole purpose of the mind-body discussion to ascertain whether the com-1 See the discussion above, in section 1:3.

I would not now stand by every criticism made there, but a considerable number of them still seem to me cogent. '"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"On Evaluating Dhannakirti's Arguments 139 mon-sense division is a legitimate one?2 May not, therefore, an argu-ment that presupposes that division beg the question? In the discussion of the salvific efficacy of a direct realization of no-self, Dharmakirti re-lies heavily on the notion that a truth, profoundly realized, is ineradicable from the mind, and, furthermore, that there are some truths (or a truth) sufficiently crucial that their assimilation will entail the total eradication of suffering. That there is any realization suffi-ciently profound to eradicate suffering is not vouchsafed by common experience or psychological observation. How, then, is it vouchsafed? Only, I think, through meditative experience. Meditative experience, as noted earlier, may give truth, and usually.imparts certainty to the ,., experiencer, but its extraordinariness makes it less reliable as a crite-rion of validity in public discussions. Dharmakirti generally avoids basing arguments on appeals to extraordinary experience, yet he seems to have imported an unstated appeal to it in this crucial in-stance. I do not think that these two instances of imported assumptions are sufficient to topple the edifice of Dharmakirti's argu-ments, but they (and others that the reader may detect) may make it a bit less steady than it first appears. (b) Philosophers are notorious for setting up their opponents as straw-men easily blown away by the rhetorical wind of \"truth,\" and we must ask, in all fairness, whether Dharmakirti falls prey to this temp-tation. He appears to make great efforts to represent his opponents' positions in detail, yet some doubts must persist. In the case of his refutation of materialism, we simply cannot be certain that Dhar-makirti is representing his opponents accurately, for the simple reason that we do not have enough Indian materialist literature to make a comparison. Many of the materialist arguments seem foolish, and hardly worthy of response, yet we must remember that (a) they may actually have been held by someone and (b) even if they were not, Dharmakirti is attempting to consider and refute all possible material-ist views. We do have independent literature from the various non -Buddhist schools whose soteriologies Dharmakirti criticizes, and here it seems that he does not always succeed in being completely fair. He rarely misrepresents an opponent's position, but he does not often permit the opponent a response that elucidates the subtleties of their position. Thus, in his concern to show that any system that posits a self automatically entails selfishness, hence the perpetuation of saI!lsara, Dharmakirti does not really allow his opponents to explain that they 2 For a clear discussion of this point, see Shaffer (1967)."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"140 Is Enlightenment Possible? are as radically opposed to self-grasping as he is, but that they seek to transcend it through subsumption by a universal self, whereas the Buddhist seeks to transcend it by recognizing that there is no self any-where, period. The existence or non-existence of a universal self then would become a further topic for debate. A corollary problem that arises from the preceding is whether, even if Dharmakirti is being utterly fair to his opponents, he has refuted all possible opponents. For instance, the materialists whom he refutes ar-gue for the invariable concomitance of mind with such material entities as the body, the sense-faculties, the breath, the humors or the elements. None of these would be argued seriously by a present-day materialist, who would claim, instead, that it is the properly function-ing brain that is the basis of what we call mind. It is uncertain whether Dharmakirti's arguments would have as much force against contem-porary materialism, for (a) much stronger arguments can be made for brain-mind concomitance than for the types of concomitance pro-posed by Dharmakirti's opponents3 and (b) compelling (though not conclusive) materialist\" models\" of the physical basis of consciousness have been offered by cognitive scientists working with computer~ and artificial intelligence.4 (And, of course, there also remains the question whether Dharmakirti's or any interactionism can be adequately de-fended against charges that it is self-contradictory to describe something as both causal and immaterial.) It might also be urged that Dharmaklrti would have more difficulty refuting a Christian or Mus-lim soteriology than those of the Indian traditions he explicitly addresses. A Buddhist undoubtedly would argue that, as long as we can translate philosophical terms adequately across traditions, Chris-tian and Muslim soteriologies could be restated in terms of the self/no-self distinction deemed so crucial by the Buddhist, and there-fore be accepted or rejected unequivocally.s 3 See, e.g., Blakemore (1977), Rose (1976) and Place (1964). A contemporary version of interactionist dualism is proposed in Popper and Eccles (1978). For remarks on Buddhist arguments for the existence of past and future lives, see Willson (1984). 4 See, e.g., the various suggestions in Hofstadter and Dennett (1981), Dennett (1978) and, most recently and interestingly, Edelman, as discussed in Heller-stein (1988). 5 The most ambitious recent attempt to do this, with respect to the' question of God, is Dharmasiri (1974); for at least the beginnings of an engagement, on the question of self/soul, see Griffiths (1991) chapter 6,"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"On Evaluating Dhannakirti's Arguments 141 (2) The question whether Dharmakirti would or could refute a Christian or Muslim world-view takes us to the second general level on which his arguments must be addressed: that of the assumptions that underlie his discussion. His arguments for past and future lives, for instance, rest upon the assumption that the Buddhist analysis of the world into durationless events is, in fact, valid, while his argu-ments for the salvific value of a realization of no-self presuppose that no-self is, in fact, the way things ultimately are. Yet these, and most other Buddhist doctrines assumed by Dharmakirti, have been sub-jected to attack by various non-Buddhist schools. The doctrine of momentariness (as noted earlier) has been criticized in general for vi-tiating causality and, in the particular instance of rebirth from life to life, for failing to account for personal continuity and karmic respon-sibility. In the eyes of the critic, for all the Buddhist's attempts to qualify momentariness by dependent origination, the dilemma seems absolute: either events are utterly momentary, and no continuity can . be posited, or there is some carry-over from moment to moment, in which case some type of permanence-hence a self-is being admit-ted. The doctrine of anatman comes under attack for similar reasons, then: without positing a self, the critic argues, we cannot account for the continuities that obviously exist in the world, so it is Buddhists who are not reporting reality\" truly,\" and they, therefore, who are spiri-tually doomed. Similarly, Buddhist accounts of the initial non-conceptual immedi-acy of perception may be criticized on the grounds that, regardless of how it seems to the perceiver, all perceptions are in fact determined at least in part by physiological, psychological and cultural factors that rule out the pure immediacy posited by the Buddhist. The Buddhist re-jection of the existence of universals may be criticized as requiring the very entities it seeks to refute, for whether one discovers that an ani-mal is a cow \"positively\" or \"negatively,\" one still has encountered a quality that must be accounted for. At a fundamental level, the Bud-dhist division of the world into dharmas of various types may be criticized as a selection, from experience, of categories as arbitrary as .any others. And, most basically, it may be that Buddhist descriptions of the world are based on unstated assumptions about, e.g., the ultimate \"impersonality\" of reality that simply would not be shared by those who select \"personal\" metaphors, like agency, as a way of under-standing things.6 All these issues are moot, and I do not intend to fj For reflections on this issue in relation to the question of the existence of God,"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"142 Is Enlightenment Possible? discuss them here. However, the very fact that they are moot begins to hint to us that perhaps the grounds of agreement among disputants in Indian philosophical discussions were not as broad as they, or we, would like to think, and that many\"arguments simply cannot be un-derstood without the background of tradition-specific ways of thinking that are themselves problematic. Thus, it is entirely likely that a Hindu or Jaina (let alone a Christian or Muslim) will have difficulty accepting Dharmakirti's arguments not only because they may find the arguments themselves problematic, but because there are assump-tions-some logical and some pre-logical-informing those arguments with which they fundamentally disagree. (3) Thus, we arrive at the third, and most general, level on which Dharmakirti's arguments must be assessed. Here, what is questioned is not the validity of particular arguments (level 1) or the validity of particular ontological or epistemological assumptions (level 2), but, rather, the validity of the entire enterprise in which Dharmakirti and so many others were engaged: the attempt to arrive at certain, univer-sal knowledge through securely founded avenues of authoritative cognition. In short, we arrive again at the question of truth. We already have seen that questioning along these lines has been increasingly common in the \"post-modernist\" Western tradition, and that such questioning is present in the Indian tradition, too, e.g., in the works of Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna's critique of philosophical concepts and the ways in which we arrive at them did not appreciably affect the devel-opment of constructive philosophy in India, nor is it clear that this was his intent. When, however, we begin to realize the difficulty we have in attempting to justify even the most basic truth-claims (let alone whole world-views), we begin to wonder whether Nagarjuna should not have been taken more literally, for the entire edifice of construc-tive philosophy does seem wobbly. We think that we have developed universal methods of agreement based on inference and worldly per-ception, yet at every turn we find our \"neutral\" perceptions and inferences structured by presuppositions and assumptions that are themselves problematic-and our very methods of cognition are prob-lematic, too. There seems to be no proposition (even the axioms, or \"laws of thought\"that undergird philosophical discussion) that can be asserted unambiguously or without qualification, no epistemological fulcrum on which dispassionately to balance competing truth-claims. Indeed, as we have seen, the corollaries of the sort of skeptical ques-see R. Jackson (1986)."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"On Evaluating Dhannakirti's Arguments 143 tioning outlined here are (a) the abandonment of a correspondence criterion of truth and its replacement by a pragmatic or coherence cri-terion and (b) the acceptance of a relativism whereby truth is determined within particular \"communities of discourse.\" A Buddhist adopting this position thus would not claim that Dhar-maklrti's (or any other) arguments for the Buddhist world-view can be decisively proven-for inference, religiOUS experience, and even com-mon perception all are problematic to a degree. They probably would maintain modestly that the Buddhist world-view can be verified within a Buddhist frame of reference, and that the world-view thus is \"true,\" for there is no over-arching set of truths that could falsify it. Neither religion nor science may any longer claim universality or ex-clusivity, yet neither thereby forfeits its claim to truth, for truth means not correspondence to some\" objective\" reality, but simply what is co-herent and effective within a particular community of discourse. Thus, whereas traditional and post-modern Buddhists both will insist that the answer to the question \"Is enlightenment possible?\"is \"yes,\"this \"yes\" will mean very different things to each. For the former, it will mean that there exist and have existed people who have attained an actual psychological state corresponding to one or another description of the Buddhist summum bonum. For the latter, it will mean that a given Buddhist community-or crucial members of the community-agree that certain persons are to be recognized as \"enlightened.\"For the for-mer, enlightenment is a \"real\" state; for the latter, it is a social construction that may enhance individual and collective well-being, but its \"truth\" is utterly undemonstrable-and perhaps irrelevant-outside the Buddhist community. We cannot, the latter insist, nor should we care to, ask for more. And yet, as the reader no doubt will surmise by now, I doubt that the degree of relativism implied by the post-modernist position would gain total assent from many of us, let alone from the traditionalist, for whom the universality of a religion's claims are, almost by definition, vital. Are we not, as I have argued before, able to translate from one community of discourse or \"language game\" to another, and does this not imply areas of agreement among us that may be the basis for es-tablishing some truths as \"correspondent\" beyond any taint of subj ectivity or self-contradiction? Does not the logical demolition of logical and epsitemological certainty itself imply a certainty? Do not questions remain about how broadly or narrowly\" communities of discourse\" are to be defined and what their areas of overlap are?

There probably is a way the universe really exists, and rationality is the most generally reliable method our species has developed for ap-proaching what the universe might actually be like. What is more, it is entirely possible that some particular tradition actually has come closer to describing the way the universe is than others have. Most Christians have believed this about their tradition; Dharmakirti cer-tainly believes it about his. Religious people make existentially significant truth claims that they take to correspond to the real nature of the universe, and as long as they do, we owe it to them and to our-selves to try to clarify and evaluate those claims, for the simple reason that, whether we admit it or not, truth matters. Although we cannot ignore the limitations of our very tools of clarification and evaluation, we nevertheless must attempt judiciously to weigh the evidence pre-sented to us, in the hope that, even if \"final\" certainty never will be ours, the world may on some matters move towards becoming a single \"community of discourse,\" and on those others where total agreement is impossible, a community of tolerance and sympathetic under-standing.7 Perhaps in the end Dharmakirti's project, and our own struggles with \"truth,\"may simply have to be accepted as paradoxical: unpromising, yet urgent; unfounded, yet a foundation of human life; probably impossible, undeniably necessary-to paraphrase a charac-ter from Samuel Beckett's Happy Days: we can't goon; we must go on. I hope I have made at least somewhat plausible the claim that, para-dox notwithstanding, \"we must go on\" in our pursuit of truth. In any case, Dharmakirti-in spite of an ontology that denies either a sub-stantial self or real external objects-went on, and it his pursuit of truth, as exposed through his Tibetan commentator rGyal tshab rje, to which the remainder of this book is devoted. The journey through Dharmakirti and rGyal tshab rje's arguments may convince some that enlightenment is in fact pOSSible; others will conclude that the arguments fail, and so enlightenment is impossible; 7 For a thoughtful discussion of these issues, particularly as pertains to the re-lationship between religion and science, see Barbour (1974), which defends \"critical realism\" (cf. above, p. 35, n. 1). It is interesting to note that\" critical re-alism\"is the designation given to Sautrantika thought by Mookerjee (1980). An epistemological position less skeptical than Barbour's is. found in Popper (1963). A more skeptical position (hence, ironically, one that opens the door more widely to religious truths) is represented by Feyerabend (1975); see also the application of this sort of approach to the Indian context, by O'Flaherty .

Nevertheless, readers who follow them all the way-even if to an uncertain end-will be rewarded by the knowl-edge that they have explored some of the most sophisticated arguments ever framed by Buddhists. Convincing or not, the argu-ments are an invitation to \"come and see\"for oneself the depths of the Buddhist philosophical tradition, and whether the acceptance of such an invitation leaves one a skeptic, a believer, or wanting to explore the possibilities in ways that lie beyond the scope of rationality, to accept is worthwhile, because we admit thereby that we take truth and its claimants seriously, and are willing ourselves to \"come and see\"where it is they propose to lead us."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Part Two About the Translation"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"1. Scholarship on Dharmakirti Dharmakirti is indisputably one of the greatest and most influential phi-losophers of Indian Buddhism's classical period, yet the study, translation and understanding of his work is still, relatively speaking, in its infancy. I do not intend to provide here a complete account of Dharmakirti schol-arship, but simply to indicate some of the main trends and works in the field-primarily as a way of more clearly locating my own effort Readers who wish more complete bibliographic information on Dharmakirti or any other figure or movement discussed below are advised to consult Karl Potter's exhaustive and clearly cross-referenced Bibliography of In-dian Philosophies (1983: e.g., 114-117, 621-623)-not the least of whose virtues is its inclusion of Japanese scholarship-as well as the more re-cent bibliographies found in, e.g., Hayes (1988a), van Bijlert (1989) and Dreyfus (1991). Dharmakirti is classed by most writers on Indian philosophy as a \"logician\" or \"epistemologist,\" so his works often are discussed within the broader context of works on Indian logic and epistemology. Works that deal with this area have been appearing for over a half-century now, but reliable monographs still are few and far between. S.c. Vidy-abhushana's History of Indian Logic (1920; rpt. 1978) is an early effort that gives a useful survey of the range of figures and texts, though a fair amount of its historical information must be considered suspect. Reliable guides to modes of inference and argumentation in Indian phi-losophy include Karl Potter's Presuppositions of India's Philosophies (1967; rpt. 1976) and Esther Solomon's Indian Dialectics: Methods of Philosophical Discussion (1976-78). Useful general works on Indian epistemology include Jadunath Sinha's Indian Psychology (1934) and Bimal MatilaI's Perception (1986). Nyaya-Vai§e~ika approaches to logic and epistemology may be gleaned from standard works on Indian phi-losophy' such as those of Surendranath Dasgupta (rpt. 1975) and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1929), as well as Potter's superb volume on Nyaya-Vai§e~ika in the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies (1977). Last, but by no means least, the works of E. Frauwallner, whose masterpiece"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"150 Is Enlightenment Possible? is his Geschichte der Indischen Philosophie (1953), remain a treasury of information on Indian and Buddhist logic and epistemology. As a subcategory of Indian logic and epistemology, Buddhist pramii1Ja literature has received its share of attention, too. If we leave aside the works of those who treat Buddhist logic as a formal logical system-Richard Chi (Buddhist Formal Logic [1969]) and Douglas Daye (Metalogical Studies in Sixth-Century Buddhist Pro to logic [1972]) are two prominent examples-we still find a number of important works that examine the tradition either broadly or through one or more of its rep-resentative figures. F.Th. Stcherbatsky's two-volume Buddhist Logic (1930; rpt. 1962) remains in many ways a classic work. Certainly, one must be wary of Stcherbatsky's tendency to confuse Vaibha~ika and Sautrantika viewpoints (a difficuly noted by both Leonard Zwilling [1975] and Anne Klein [1986]), or to generalize about the whole tradi-tion on the basis of its later representatives (especially Santarak~ita and Kamala§ila), or to apply inappropriate or outdated comparisons from Western philosophy. However, the work as a whole remains a rich source of information and insight, and its second volume, cen-tered on Stcherbatsky's translation of portions of Dharmakirti's Nyiiyabindu, together with Dharmottara's commentary, remains an im-portant source for scholars. Also still of use is Satkari Mookerjee's The Buddhist Doctrine of Universal Flux (1935; rpt. 1980), which consi;:lers the whole tradition, but focuses most on the contributions of San-tarak~ita and Famala§ila; by the same token, Ganganatha Jha's translation of Santarak~ita's Tattvasa1flgraha, together with Kamala-sila's Pafijikii (1937-39), remains one of the finest and most useful sources for our understanding of late Buddhist ontology and episte-mology. Other figures in the Buddhist logical tradition who have received serious scrutiny include Dharmakirti's precursor, Dignaga (most notably by M. Hattori [1968] and Richard Hayes [1988]), and one of the last great Indian Buddhist philosophers, Ratnakirti (by A.c. Senape McDermott [1970]). The only general text on Buddhist thought that contains reliable information on the pramii1Ja tradition is that of A.K. Warder (1980). Dharmakirti probably has received the most attention of any Bud-dhist logician, though monographs devoted to him still are few and far between. Leaving aside the Pramii1Javiirttika for the moment, we find that most of his works-whether extant in Sanskrit or not-have by now been issued in critical editions, and a number have· been trans-lated, too. Thus, for example, the Nyiiyabindu has been edited by C. Sastri (1954), the Hetubindu (in part, 1967) and Pramii1Javiniscaya (in part, 1973-1979) by Ernst Steinkellner, and the Viidanyiiya[prakarm.wl by Dwarikadas Shastri (1972).

General discussions of Dhar-makirti and his philosophy are found primarily in a few monographs and in articles too numerous to mention, but among the most note-worthy are Frauwallner's article on the formation and organization of Dharmakirti's work (1954), Tillman Vetter's book on the problem of knowledge in Dharmakirti (1964), Steinkellner's article on reality and concept in Dharmakirti (1967) and Chr. Lindtner's article on Dhar-makirti's date and corpus (1980). The Pramiinaviirttika, a Sanskrit text of which was discovered in Ti-bet over half ~ century ago by Rahula Sfui.krtyayana, has undergone a number of editions, either partial or complete (by, e.g., Sankrtyayana himself, Raniero Gnoli (1960), Satkari Mookerjee (1968), and Dalsukh Malvaniya and Dwarikadas Shastri (1968», but the edition generally used nowadays is that ofY. Miyasaka (1972-77), which, in addition to the care with which it was prepared, has the advantage of placing the Sanskrit and Tibetan texts together in the same volume. If we except the Pramii1Jasiddhi chapter (on which more below), we find that trans-lations from the Pramii1Javiirttika into Western languages have mostly been sporadic and partial. Frauwallner (1930-36), Gnoli (1960) and Zwilling (1976) have translated significant portions of the Sviirthiinumiina chapter, Georges Dreyfus and Lindtner (1989) small portions of the Pratyii~a chapter and Tom F.J. Tillemans (1986) a small portion of the Pariirthiinumiina chapter. The works just cited contain excellent discussions of a number of elements of the Pramiinaviirttikti, as does Dreyfus's recently completed dissertation (1991).' . The Pramii1Jasiddhi chapter is, with the Sviirthiinumiina, the section of the Pramii1Javiirttika that has received the most attention. It has been translated from the Sanskrit in toto only by Masatoshi Nagatomi, in his still-unpublished dissertation (1957). The second half of the chapter (Miyasaka verses 146c-287) has been translated into German by Vetter (1984). Smaller portions of the chapter have been translated by Katsura (1984: verses 1-7), van Bijlert (1989: verses 1-7) and by me (1986: verses 7-13,21-28; 1990: verses 205b-211a). Analyses of various aspects of the Pramii1Jasiddhi chapter include Nagatomi's article on the chapter's framework and its relation to Dignaga's Pramii1Jasamuccaya (1959), Steinkellner's ground-breaking analysis of the relation be-tween epistemology and soteriology (1982), van Bijlert's examination of the definition of pramii1Ja (1989), analyses by Steinkellner (1983) and me (1988) of the concept of an\" authoritative person,\" and discus-"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"152 Is Enlightenment Possible? sions by me of Dharmakirti's attitude toward theism (1986), omnis-cience (1987) and the nature of the mind (1990). The Tibetan tradition of logic and epistemology, for which Dhar-makirti and the Prama1favarttika are so important, has only in the last decade begun to receive serious study. In terms of historical analysiS, the most important contributions have come from Leonard W,J. van der Kuijp (esp. 1983, 1987) and David Jackson (1987), who have pains-takingly researched the Sa skya pa roots of the Tibetan study of logic and epistemology. The way in which the logical tradition was under-stood by dGe lugs pas-both among themselves and in contradistinction to other schools-has been studied in detail by Anne Klein (1986, 1991). The Tibetan tradition of debate has been discussed by, among others, Lobsang Tharchin (1970) and Daniel Perdue (1992). Outlines of Tibetan commentaries on the Pramanavarttika have been furnished by van der Kuijp (1983: that of the fifteenth-century Sa skya pa Go ram pa bsod nams seng ge), Fukuda and Ishihama (1986 ref.: several; see p. 116, n. 19) and Inami and Tillemans (1986: that of the fifteenth-century dGe lugs pa dGe 'dun grub). I shall say more below about my reasons for translating, and anno-tating so extensively, rGyal tshab rje's commentary to the Prama1fasiddhi chapter of the Prama1favarttika. Let me say by way of conclusion to this survey, however, that my translation is indeed in-tended as a contribution to Dharmakirti studies (as well, I hope, as to our understanding of Indian philosophy, both in its own context, and in relation to relevant Western discussions), but that its contribution is somewhat indirect. Because I have focused on a Tibetan commentary and the Tibetan version of Dharmakirti's text, I am not transposing Dharmakirti unalloyed from his original language and context. I have said before that my primary purpose is to expose a significant vein of Indo-Tibetan philosophical thought. Thus, although I hope I have re-mained sensitive to the various contexts in which different discussions may have originated or evolved, the unending discussion of such mat-ters has not been foremost among my concerns. If I have provided for interested readers-whether Buddhological or philosophical in their interests-a reasonably accessible and comprehensible example of Indo-Tibetan philosophizing, I will be satisfied; if readers find that the translation contributes in ways beyond this, so much the better."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"2. rGyal tshab rje and His World-View rGyal tshab dar rna rin chen (1364-1432), author of the commentary on Dharmaklrti's arguments translated in part below, was, as already noted, one of the great disciples of Tsong kha pa blo bzanggrags pa (1357-1419), the founder of the dGe lugs, the Tibetan Buddhist tradition that eventu-ally, under the Dalai Lamas, came to dominate both religious and political life in Tibet (as well as Mongolia). Like another of Tsong kha pa's great disciples, mKhas grub dge legs dpal bzang po (mKhas grub rje), rGyal tshab rje originally was a Sa skya pal a learned student of the lama Red mda' ba (who also was a teacher of Tsong kha pa). Accounts of rGyal tshab rje's first meeting with Tsong kha pa stress his arrogance and pride. In one version, he and mKhas grub rje go to a hall where Tsong kha pa is to lecture. When they enter, mKhas grub rje is impressed immediately by Tsong kha pa's aura of holiness and erudition, and removes his pandit's hat and sits at his feet. rGyal tshab rje, however, insists not only on keep-ing his hat on, but on sitting on the teaching throne with Tsong kha pa. As Tsong kha pals lecture proceeds, however, rGyal tshab rje be-gins to realize that he is in the presence of genius. By the end, he too has removed his hat and is sitting at Tsong kha pals feet. In another version, rGyal tshab rje and mKhas grub rje have de-cided to listen to Tsong kha pa, but do not know where to find him. Walking along the road, they encounter a woman drawing water. They approach her and ask derisively where they might find \"the big-eared Khampa.\"The woman does not answer, but goes to her house, and re-turns a minute later reverently holding incense between folded palms. She points down the road and says, \"The holy one can be found there.\" Amused, but hardly chastened, mKhas grub rje and rGyal tshab rje proceed to the small hall where Tsong kha pa is to speak. They decide ahead of time not to remove their pandit's hats. mKhas grub rje enters first and, neglecting to stoop under the low door-frame, he loses his hat. rGyal tshab rje, following, remembers to duck, but has his hat knocked off by the door-curtain, which slaps him in mKhas grub rje's wake. The symbolism is not lost on them, and they listen respectfully"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"154 Is Enlightenment Possible? to Tsong kha pa, eventually becoming his greatest disciples. Before Tsong kha pa's death in 1419, he passed on his robe and hat to rGyal tshab rje, who succeeded his guru as the head of dGa'ldan monastery, near Lhasa. rGyal tshab rje remained as dGa'ldan 'khri pa until his death, at the age of 68, in 1432. He was succeeded by the younger mKhas grub rje. The two are now so closely identified with Tsong kha pa, and so thoroughly said to embody his teaching, that they almost invariably are pictured with him on thangkas and in statuary in dGe lugs pa temples: the three together are referred to by dGe lugs pas as the yab sras gsum, the threesome of father and sons.1 rGyal tshab rje did not, of course, acquire his reputation simply by being a loyal disciple to Tsong kha pa; he was a great scholar in his own right. Like those of other great scholars in the Tibetan tradition, his writings cover a wide range of Buddhist subject-matter, from the arcane mysteries of the Kalacakra Tantra, to the subtleties of the Perfec-tion of Wisdom and pramii1J-a, to details of various \"profane\" sciences. It seems safe to say, however, that his reputation among dGe lugs pas rests primarily on his commentaries to Mahayana sastra literature. Among the works that seem to enjoy particular esteem are his com-mentaries to: Maitreya's Abhisamiiyiila1?1kiira, the rNam bshad snying po rgyan; Maitreya's Uttaratantra (as the Ratnagotravibhiiga usually is known in Tibet), the Theg pa chen po rgyud bla ma'i tlkka; Santideva's Bodhicaryiivatiira, the sPyod 'jug rnam bshad; and Dharmakirti's Pramii1J-aviirttika, the rNam 'grel thar lam gsal byed.2 On a superficial reading, the rNam 'grel thar lam gsal byed (\"Eluci-dating the Path to Liberation according. to the Pramii1J-aviirttika\") appears seamless and coherent, as if rGyal tshab rje's mind had been melded to Dharmakirti's.

Many of the differences between the two will be brought out in the notes to the translation, but at least a broad sketch of the sort of assumptions in-forming rGyal tshab rje's world-view is not out of place here. The overall framework of rGyal tshab rje's thought has four crucial characteristics, in descending order of generality. It is: (a) Mahayana, (b) lam rim, (c) Prasangika Madhyamika and (d) dGe lugs pa. (a) As Mahayana, rGyal tshab rje's system accepts as virtually axi-omatic certain ideas about the goal and path of Buddhism. I have discussed many of these in section 1:5, but will briefly recapitulate some of them here. The goal is assumed to be full buddhahood, a con-dition of complete omniscience, infinite compassion and virtually unlimited power. Buddhahood is divisible into three \"bodies\": the Dharma Body (dharmaka.ya), which is, roughly, enlightened mind; the Enjoyment Body (sambhogaka.ya), which is, roughly, enlightened com-munication; and the Transformation Body (nirma.l.1aka.ya), which is, roughly, enlightened form, or enlightened action. The path, traversed by the aspirant buddha, or bodhisattva, is assumed to consist generally of two stores (sambha.ra): that of gnosis and that of merit. The former, which results in a buddha's Dharma Body, is equivalent to the Ma-hayana perfection of wisdom; the latter, which result in a buddha's Enjoyment and Transformation Bodies, is equivalent to the Mahayana perfections of generosity, morality, patience, effort and concentration. More specifically, the path is itself divisible into ten bodhisattva stages (bhumi) and/or five subsidiary paths. Of the latter, two, the paths of ac-cumulation and application, are \"mundane.\" On them, one practices the various Mahayana virtues, develops one's one-pointed concentra-tion and analyzes the nature of reality discursively. On the path of seeing, one combines one-pointed concentration with insight into the nature of reality in such a way that reality is seen directly. Defilements are at last uprooted and the supramundane paths entered. The process of the elimination of subtler and subtler defilements continues through the path of development, until, when no more defilements-or their residues-remain, one achieves the path of no-more-training, the first moment of buddhahood.3 3 On Mahayana, see, e.g., Dayal (1970), Warder (1980), The Dalai Lama (1985), Williams (1988), etc."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"156 Is Enlightenment Possible? (b) As lam rim, rGyal tshab rje's system is rooted in the common stitra -level meditative structures accepted by virtually all Tibetan Bud-dhlst schools. Based on the Bodhipathapradipa of the eleventh-century Bengali traveler Atisa, the lam rim, or \"stages of the path\"to enlight-enment is a graded series of meditations that condenses and organizes the mass of material inherited by the Tibetans from Indian Buddhism. The lam rim is structured most generally by psychological types: beings of lesser, intermediate and great \"scope,\" or aspiration. Beings of lesser scope are capable only of aspiring to a higher rebirth in a future life, and so must become aware of the rarity, preciousness and fragility of a human rebirth, the nature of the lower realms of sarrtsara, and the way in which positive and negative actions (karma) lead to positive and negative results. Aware of these points, they will strive to· act virtuously and thus achieve the higher rebirth to which they aspire. Beings of intermediate scope must be aware of all this, but, aspiring to transcend any sarrtsaric existence (Le., achieve \"HInayana\" nirvaI).a), they also must be aware of the subtle ways in which the higher sarrtsaric realms are suffering and the way in which, through the twelve links of dependent origination, ignorance leads to suffering in saI!\\sara. Aware of these points, they will renounce all ignorance, at-tachment and aversion, meditate one-pointedly on the absence of any self, and achieve the nirvaI).a to which they aspire. Beings of great scope, the bodhisattvas, must be aware of all of the preceding, but, be-cause they aspire to full buddhahood, they also must develop great compassion; the altruistic aspiration to enlightenment, bodhicitta; and the particular Mahayana wisdom that sees phenomena as void and/or mind-only. Having developed one-pointed concentration on this final nature of phenomena, they are ready to practice the more advanced, swifter path laid out in the tantras. It should be noted that, as a \"lat-ter-day\" lam rim system, rGyal tshab rje's entails the assumption that the \"logical\" system of Dignaga and Dharmakirti had necessarily to be understood as part of one's training in wisdom, and the converse as-sumption that the major purpose of learning logic was to assist one toward one's ultimate spiritual goals.4 (c) As Prasaitgika Madhyamika, rGyal tshab rje's system is rooted philosophically in the dialectic of Nagarjuna as interpreted in the sastras of Candrakirti (seventh century), especially the Prasannapadii 4 On lam rim, see, e.g., AtiSa (1983), sGam po pa (1970), Dhargyey (1974), Rab-ten (1984) and Thurman (1981). On the relation of lam rim to the \"logical\"tra-clition, see the references in p. 116, n. 19, above. '"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"rGyal tshab rje and His World-View 157 and the Madhyamakiivatiira. As Madhyamika, Candrakirti's system re-jects not only such Hinayana positions as Vaibhai?ika and Sautrantika, but also the Yogacara description of reality as ultimately mind-only, claiming that this description tends toward a kind of absolutization of mind. In its place, the Madhyamika will insist that the ultimate nature of all phenomena (including dharmas, mind, and anything else) is voidness (sunyatii) of substantial existence. AsPrasangika, Can-drakirti's system specifies that the ultimate nature of phenomena is not only voidness, but, specifically, voidness of inherent existence (T. rang bzhin gyis grub pa). This specification supposedly results in a more subtle understanding than that of the other Madhyamika school, the Svatantrika, which merely specifies that phenomena are void of true existence (T. bdm par grub pa), and maintains (erroneously, Prasangi-kas assert) that on a conventional level phenomena are established by their own-marks, or specific characteristics (T. rang gi mtshannyid kyis grub pa). Prasangika also rejects the Svatantrika's faith in independent syllogisms (S. svatantra), preferring to argue via consequences (S. prasmiga), and asserts, uniquely, that all practitioners (Hinayana and Mahayana) realize the same object-voidness of inherent existence-prior to achieving liberation.5 (d) As dGe lugs pa, rGyal tshab rje's system is rooted in the writings and perspectives of Tsong kha pa. Tsong kha pa accepted the Ma-o hayana, lam rim and Prasangika Madhyamaka, but in a manner that often set him apart from other Tibetan thinkers who accepted the same structures. Thus, he arranged the \"stages of the path\"in a par-ticular way, such that guru-devotion was the \"root of the path,\"prior even to the contemplation of the preciousness and rarity of a human rebirth. Further, he interpreted the various philosophical systems in a manner that sometimes placed him at odds with his contemporaries. At the root of this was his profound concern with and respect for ra-tionality. Thus, he emphasized a \"strong\" relation between the conventional and the ultimate, insisting on the indispensability of a rational understanding of voidness before one can apprehend it non-conceptually. He also tended to view conventional reality through lenses shaded crucially by Sautrantika concepts, and to interpret Sau-trantika itself in a more realistic, less nominalistic manner than was common.6 5 See references in the bibliography to the works of Nagfu\"juna and Candrakirti.

These are some of the more important aspects of rGyal tshab rje's world-view. The way in which it is different from Dharmakirti's will be brought out in some detail in the notes to the translation, but at least a few of the more important points of difference may be summarized here. First, rGyal tshab rie assumes that full omniscience is a fruit of the Buddhist path, and therefore reads Dharmakirti as attempting to prove omniscience in the course of the PramaIJasiddhi chapter; in fact, Dharmakirti nowhere explicitly says that this is what he is trying to do. Second, rGyal tshab rie assumes the applicability of the five-path sys-tem common to many Indian Buddhist schools, and often reads Dharmakirti as making reference to one or another of these paths; in fact, Dharmakirti nowhere in the PramaIJasiddhi chapter mentions any of the five paths. Third, rGyal tshab rie assumes a basic distinction be-tween a no-self of persons and a no-self of dharmas, and claims that Dharmakirti treats the former in the Pramal.wsiddhi chapter and the latter in the Pratyak~a chapter; in fact, Dharmakirti appears nowhere to recognize this distinction explicitly. Fourth, rGyal tshab rie assumes that the most advanced practitioners are Mahayanists, and therefore he reads Dharmakirti as asserting the superiority of Mahayana over Hinayana techniques and practitioners; in fact, Dharmakirti nowhere in the PramaIJasiddhi chapter makes it clear that this is his point. In short, rGyal tshab rje, as a Mahayanist, assumes that Dharmakirti, as a \"Cittamatrin Following Reasoning,\" is a Mahayanist, and therefore embracing a Mahayana soteriology. We have seen above, however (section 1:9), that it is not evident that Dharmakirti is doing this. To re-iterate: Dharmakirti's work shows clear traces of Yogacara epistemology and ontology, but very little evidence of a specifically Mahayana sote-riology-especially not of the elaborate kind taken for granted by rGyal tshab rie.

In attempting to expose the Prama1}asiddhi chapter of that great work to readers of English, I have settled on trans-lating rGyal tshab rje's commentary for a number of reasons: 1. Dharmakirti's verses are terse in the extreme, and cannot easily be read without a commentary to provide needed interpolations and explanations. As noted, Masatoshi Nagatomi translated the Prama1}asiddhi chapter directly from the Sanskrit as his dissertation for Harvard in 1957, but the work has yet to be published. Nagatomi pro-vides excellent cross-references and a useful bilingual glossary, but his occasional interpolation of glosses from the commentaries of Mano-rathiinandin and Prajniikaragupta does not go far enough toward making the philosophical meaning of Dharmakirti's verses accessible. Nagatomi and, more recently, Richard Hayes, have been working on translations of the entire Pramal.1avarttika. These will be important landmarks in Buddhist studies when they appear, but in the meantime it seems useful to expose at least part of the Dharmakirti corpus to readers interested in either Buddhism or philosophy of religion, for any of whom the Prama1}asiddhi chapter ought to be of basic interest. Any commentary, especially one separated from its root-text by seven centuries, several philosophical systems and the highest mountains in the world, necessarily distorts the original, but this distortion is a price that must be paid for comprehensibility-and the commentarial proc-ess of distortion is itself interesting, and will be noted where necessary. 2. rGyal tshab rje's commentary has the specific virtue of having been written after all the great Indian commentaries, and with all of them at hand and under consideration. Thus, rGyal tshab rje-though not, of course, without his prejudices-was able to separate the wheat from the chaff in the commentarial tradition and to give the most weight to the explanations that seemed to him the most reasonable. He has relied most heavily on the commentaries of Devendrabuddhi"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"160 Is EnlightenmentPossible? and Prajfiakaragupta.1 Devendrabuddhi, as we have seen, wrote his PramaIJavarttikapanjika under the direct supervision of Dharmakirti himself, and thus can be assumed closely to have captured the literal meaning, if not the depth and breadth, of his intention. Prajfiakara-gupta's PramaIJavarttikala1flkara, besides being a knowledgeable exposition of the text, is important for its spelling out of many of the Mahayana themes left implicit in the PramaIJasiddhi chapter by Dhar-makirti himself. 3. Unlike most Indian commentaries, rGyal tshab rje's commentary structures the PramaIJasiddhi chapter according to an extremely de-tailed outline. The Tibetan scholastic habit of providing elaborate textual divisions (sa bead) for commentaries undeniably has proven a mixed blessing. There are times when the sa bead threaten fairly to strangle the text under study-particularly when the work is not per-haps as neat and systematic as the scholastic mind would like to imagine. There is the further danger, of course, that the sa bead will represent not the intentions of the work's author but the imagination of the commentator. These dangers must be borne in mind, but sa bead do, in the right hands, possess the enormous advantage of laying bare the structure of a work whose meaning would be far less accessible without such elucidation. I believe that the PramaIJasiddhi chapter of the PramaIJavarttika is such a work, and that rGyal tshab rje's division of the text, while by no means the only one possible (and while clearly going beyond Dharmakirti's explicit intention in a number of in-stances) is a considerable boon to anyone who wishes seriously to study the chapter. 4. Unlike many (though not all) Tibetan commentaries, rGyal tshab rje's commentary not only elucidates the meaning of Dharmakirti's root-verses, but provides in addition extremely helpful summaries and/or extended discussions at a number of points. Of particular inter-1 Ruegg (1966 [37-38, note 1]), citing kLong rdol bla rna and Stcherbatsky (1962 [1,42]), assigns rGyal tshab rje to the Kashmiri \"critical\"school of PV com-mentators, founded by Dharmottara and Saitkarananda, rather than to the \"philological\" school of Devendrabuddhi or the \"religious\" school of Pra-jfiakaragupta (to which mKhas grub rje's commentary is assigned). I confess that I do not understand this assignment. There is scant mention of either Dharmottara or Sankarananda in the rNam 'grel thar lam gsal byed; both De-vendrabuddhi and Prajfiakaragupta, on the other hand, are quoted often. My own sense is that rGyal tshab rje follows most closely on the \"religious\" school, but I admit that there may be subtleties in the scheme of classification that I do not understand."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The Translation: The Whys and Wherefores 161 est are the discussion of the compatibility between the notion that a pramii1Ja must be \"new\" and the Mahayana concept of omniscience (III:2), a summary of arguments on the mind-body problem (III:4), and the proofs of liberation and omniscience interpolated into the discus-sion of the truth of cessation (III:9). Of other Tibetan commentaries, I have looked most closely at those of dGe 'dun grub pa (fifteenth cen-tury, dGe lugs) and Mi pham rgya mtsho (nineteenth century, rNying rna). The former has the virtue of being a concise, syllogistically-framed gloss on Dharmakirti's verses. The latter, despite its prolixity, spells out Dharmakirti's meaning in considerable detail. Tomy mind, however, neither of them digresses as interestingly or as clearly as rGyal tshab rje's commentary. 5. Finally, precisely because the rNam 'grel thar lam gsal byed is the basis of dGe lugs pa Pramii1Javiirttika interpretation, it is part of a large, living philosophical tradition that still has many knowledgeable exponents. Students who ask dGe lugs pa teachers for proofs of re-birth or enlightenment or the four noble truths sooner or later will be referred to rGyal tshab rje's commentary, and it has been my good for-tune to be able to study the text with Tibetan teachers to whom its details and meaning are very familiar. Before unleashing the reader on the translation-or perhaps it is better expressed the other way around!-I want to point out a number of stylis-tic and other idiosyncracies worthy of brief mention. 1. The numbered, capitalized verses that inaugurate each section are, as noted in the preface, translated from the Tibetan version of the Pramii1Javiirttika, since this was the version used by rGyal tshab rje in composing his commentary. The capitalized words and phrases within the commentary highlight rGyal tshab rje's incorporation of Dhar-makirti's verses. Because I have tried to translate the root-text in the light of rGyal tshab rje's particular reading of the Tibetan, my rendition is in some cases two stages removed from the original Sanskrit. Let me simply reiterate what I said in the preface: this book is a translation of rGyal tshab rje's commentary, with a translation of Dharmakirti's verses interpolated for the sake of clarity; it is not a definitive transla-tion of Dharmakirti's original text. I have followed the numbering and text of Miyasaka's edition (1972-77). The corresponding verse in Shas-tri's edition (1968) may be found by adding 2 to Miyasaka's number. By and large, lines a and b of the Tibetan verse will correspond to the first line, and lines c and d to the second line, of the Sanskrit sloka. Because of the peculiarities of Tibetan synt9.x (here reflecting the Sanskrit rather closely), translation order often is the reverse of text order. Fur-thermore, rGyal tshab rje's commentarial choices often dictate"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"162 Is Enlightenment Possible? reversals where translation would not. Therefore, although I have bro-ken the translation of each verse into four lines, seldom does the first line correspond exactly to line a of the Tibetan, the second line to line b, etc. Indeed, as often as not, one of my translated lines includes ele-ments from more than one Tibetan line-such are the exigencies of translation. 2. I have not included the Tibetan text of rGyal tshab rje's commen-tary, since (a) the book would become even larger than it already is and (b) the rNam 'grel thar lam gsal byed is available in book form in a two-volume in-print edition (1974) published by the Pleasure of Elegant Sayings Press {Tibetan Monastery), Samath, Varanasi 221007, India. 3. I have tried to translate rGyal tshab rje's Tibetan into English as readable as possible, but I fear that some turgidity remains. This is un-avoidable, for both the style and subject-matter of rGyal tshab rje's discussion are quite technical. The structuring of much of the material in either syllOgistic or reductio form, as well as the frequent use of technical philosophical vocabulary, make mellifluous rendering rather difficult. I have, I hope, somewhat mitigated the stylistiC difficulties by translating the text as a philosophical treatise, not a debate manual-one way in which it may be read and used. Thus, I have translated the work into sentences rather than syllogisms. I have left untranslated such \"markers\"as chos can, which invariably sets off the logical subject, but I trust that my sentences are clear and regular enough that the syl-logistic structure is evident. I have tried to mitigate the difficulty of the subject-matter by providing a rather large apparatus of notes. These are used partially for bibliographic and linguistic observations, but their primary purpose is to elucidate the meaning of the text. It would be presumptuous of me to treat them as a \"sub-commentary,\"but I do hope they will help make Dharmakirti and rGyal tshab rje's often complex thought somewhat clearer to the reader. 4. In my translation of Tibetan terms and words into English, I have tried to maintain an overall but by no means slavish consistency. Some single English word may translate several different Tibetan terms, as, e.g., \"mind,\"which variously renders the Tibetan blo, yid, or sems, etc.; and \"nature,\"which renders, among others, the Tibetan rang bzhin or chos nyid. Conversely, some single Tibetan word may be given different English equivalents in different contexts, as, e.g., bde ba, which can be either \"happiness\" or \"pleasure\"; 'dzin pa, which means either\" appre-hension\" or \"grasping\"; grub pa, which is either\" accomplishment\" or \"proof\"; and don, which is a \"goal,\"an \"aim\"or an \"object.\"I have at-tempted to make variant translations clear by cross-references ~n the· glossary."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The Translation: The Whys and Wherefores 163· 5. I have translated into their Sanskrit forms a number of words that are most familiar thus, e.g., sal!lsara, nirval!a, arhant, sutra, Mahayana and the names of Indian personages and philosophical schools. 6. Much of rGyal tshab rje's commentary is in \"dialogue\"form, with questions or objections from real or hypothetical opponents setting the stage for the exposition of the\" correct\" position on a given matter. Some of the opposing points actually are contained in Dharmakirti's verses; most of them must be supplied by commentaries. I have de-marcated the sections that usually conclude with the Tibetan zhe na (\"it it is said ... \") as: [OPPONENT:], with the understanding that many of the views expressed by \"opponents\" are merely possible posi-tions' rather than positions actually held by Dharmakirti's or rGyal tshab rje's contemporaries. I have demarcated the \"reply\" sections as [RGYAL TSHAB RJE:]. I realize that in the vast majority of cases rGyal tshab rje is simply fleshing out Dharmakirti's meaning, but the order-ing and phrasing nevertheless remain rGyal tshab rje's, and it seems fairer to attribute the\" correct\" side of the dialogue to him. In those cases where rGyal tshab rje has significantly departed from the most straightforward reading of the root-verses, I have attempted so to in-dicate in the notes. 7. Brackets in the course of the translation indicate either interpo-lations that clarify the meaning of a sentence or nominal phrases that replace pronouns and therefore identify their antecedents. 8. In the body of the translation, I have included all of rGyal tshab rje's section titles, and have numbered them consecutively; the num-ber is indicated parenthetically after the title. Since these sections actually comprise a complex scheme of divisions and subdivisions that is, in effect, rGyal tshab rje's outline of the chapter, an Appendix is de-voted to a listing of all section titles. There, the title is preceded by the consecutive number assigned to it in the body of the translation, and its more detailed enumeration in rGyal tshab rje's outline. Each title is followed by (a) the verse(s) it covers in the Miyasaka edition of the Pramar;.avarttika, (b) the pages it covers in the Samath edition of the rNam 'grel thar lam gsal byed and (c) the pages it covers in my translation.

The TI-betan commentarial tradition considers it the second, and holds the Sviirlhiinumiina chapter to be the first, because (a) DharmakIrti is said to have written the Sviirthiinumiina chapter first, to have considered it the most diffi-cult, and to have written his own commentary only on it and (b) because it is necessary to establish at the outset the structure of syllogisms, which will be used as the argumentative framework throughout the remainder of the Pramii7;laviirttika. Modern scholars who observe the Tibetan ordering include Frauwallner (1954) and Inami and Tlllemans (1986). All three modem editors of the Pramii7;laviirttika, as well as Nagatomi (1959 [263, note 1]) and Stcher-batsky (1962 [I, 38-39]), consider the Pramii7;lasiddhi as the first, reasoning that, since the Pramii7;laviirttika is constructed as a commentary on the Pramii7;lasamuccaya, the Pramii7;laviirttika chapter that comments on the first verses of the Pramii7;lasamuccaya must be the first. It ought to be noted, how-ever, that the first \"chapter\" of the Pramii7;lasamuccaya covers perception (pralyak?a),which has never been considered the topic of the Pramii7;laviirl-tika's first chapter, being relegated to either second (by modem editors) or third (by most Tibetans). Thus, relationship to the precise topic-ordering of the Pramii7;lasamuccaya would seem not to be a manifest determinant of the Pramii7;laviirttika's order, a fact that might lend slightly more weight to the TI-betan ordering. Furthermore-and perhaps most importantly--early Indian commentaries on the Pramii7;laviirttika favor the Tibetan ordering; the ordering favored by most modem editors seems to date from the rather later commen-tary of Manorathanandin (see van Bijlert [1989] XXII, n. 2). 2 In light of the Tibetan ordering of the Pramii~viirttika's chapters, rtogs bya refers to \"what is to be known\" or understood through application of the type of syllo-gism whose structure has been established in the Sviirthiinumiina chapter, namely \"liberation and omniscience and the path leading to them.\""},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"168 Is Enlightenment Possible? of the limbs [2].3 The general meaning [lJ4 [This is divided into:] (1) Setting forth the explanation of acarya Dignaga [2], (2) The way [Dignaga's] meaning was arranged by the author of the Pramiilfaviirttika [3] and (3) The intention of [Dignaga and Dharmakirti] [4].

Nevertheless, it is admitted by TIbetan tra-dition (see Inami and Tillemans [1986]127-28) that a person maybe an authority at least by metaphorical extension. This, then, enables the TIbetans to refer to the Buddha as an \"authoritative person\" (tshad ma'i skyes bu), a term for which there seems to have been no Sanskrit prototype, yet which has helped considerably to shape TIbetan perceptions of the soteriological role of pramiiIJa-study. On this term, see Steinkellner (1983) and van der Kuijp (1987). 6 The Tibetan 'gro ba tends usually to connote \"sentient beings,\"or, more liter-ally, \"transmigrators\"; the Sanskrit jagat, though derived from the verbal root gam, (\"go\") often is translated rather more abstractly as \"the world.\" 7 skyob pa (tiiyin) is probably more accurately rendered as \"protector,\"which seems to me, however, too weak to convey the force of the idea: that the Bud-dha is one who enables others to be freed from samsara.

The second half of Dignaga's verse, however, reads in Tibetan: tshad rna bsgrub phyir rang gi gshung kun las / btus te sna tshogs 'thor rnams 'dir gcig bya (\"In order to establish authority, I make here a single compendium of my various scattered writings\"). The second half of the verse as quoted by rGyal tshab rje appears to be taken from Praji'iiikaragupta (pVA p. 3): rtog ge ngan 'khrul 'gro ba la brtse bas / tshad ma grub pa tshul bzhin bshad par bya).

Therefore, the Buddha, the Blessed One, who from excellence in causes has arisen as an authority who has as his nature excellence of the two resultant aims, must be described as perfectly authoritative.

Fur-thermore, the first is the basis of the four particular qualities that are to be established; the remaining [four] are the particular qualities that establish that [authoritativeness predicated of the Buddha]. The way of explaining that is divided into the forward system of ex-planation, which accords with the order of the verse, and the reverse system of explanation, which is the reverse of that. There is a reason for making such a division. [Some, e.g., Mima~sakas,] saying, \"Because there exists no proof14 / That there is an authority cognizing hidden objects,\"lS argue that someone's accus-tomating a method for obtaining the omniscience of one who has become an authority is not a cause producing omniscience that would 13 In other words, our failure to understand the essentials of epistemology, i.e., what authority is and who is authoritative, contributes to our misapprehen-sion of the\" actuality\" (gnas lugs) of things.

The Mima.!!1saka, therefore, is arguing that omniscience is a condition susceptible of neither logical proof nor actual accomplishment. This dual sense of sgrub byed occurs quite frequently. 15 Phenomena are divided by the Tibetan scholastic tradition into three types of objects; classified according to their accessibility to the observer: manifest (mngon gyur, *abhimukhz), hidden (lkog gyur, *paro~a) and very hidden (shin tu lkog gyur, *atyantaparok~a).

The second mode of explanation first 16 As will be noted below, in notes to section III:2:D, it is very much open to question whether DharmakIrti even accepted, let alone was intent on demon-strating, the Buddha's omniscience--especially in the full sense of the omnis-cience cognizing every aspect of reality (mam pa thams cad thams cad mkhyen pa, sarvakarajfiana). Explicitly, he seeks to prove only the Buddha's authorita-tiveness. For both Prajn.3karagupta and the Tibetan tradition, though, the Buddha's authoritativeness is synonymous with his omniscience, hence rGyal tshab rje's conflation of the two in these introductory remarks. See R. Jackson (1987 and 1988). 17 DharrnakIrti does not himself mention the thought of enlightenment (byang chub sems, bodhicitta), which is rooted in compassion and is itself, in the Ab-hisami'iyaIartlkara path-system followed by rGyal tshab rje, the \"doorway\" through which one enters the Mahayana. The thought of enlightenment is generally glossed as the altruistic aspiration to enlightenment, though it is di-visible in many ways, and has been a topic of much discussion by Mahayana writers. 18 The six transcendent practices, or perfections (pha rol tu phyin pa, pi'iramiti'i) of a bodhisattva are: (1) generosity (spyin pa, dana), (2) morality (tshul 'khrims, sUa), (3) patience (bzod pa, ~antz), (4) effort (brlson 'grus, virya), (5) concentra-tion (bsam gtan, dhyana) and (6) wisdom (shes rab, prajfia). They are transcen-dent because they are coupled with a realization of the voidness of any inherently existing aspects of the practice involved. For a discussion, see, e.g., Dayal (1970), and two great Mahayana poems, Candrakirti's Ma-dhyamakavatara (fully translated by Huntington [1989], partially translated by Poussin [1907-11] and Rabten [1983]) and Santideva's Bodhicaryavatara (translated by Batchelor [1979] and commented upon by Gyatso [1980]), both of which are structured along the lines of the perfections."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"172 Is Enlightenment Possible? establishes the four noble truths; then, having proven by reasoning that because of them [the teacher] must have excellence of realization, and from that that there must be preceding [causes], [this second mode] also correctly shows how he arrived [at his goal] by way of that path.19 The intention of [Digniiga and Dharmakirti1 [41 The purpose of proving the teacher, the Blessed One, to be an authority, through proving that his teaching is flawless, is [to effect] the accomplishment of the goal manifestly desired by those intent on freedom.

This point is made clearly by Mi pham rgya mtsho (n.d.) 257. On the question of which of Dharmaki\"rti's verses cover which system, see above, p. 128, n.2. 20 High rebirths (mngon tho, abhyudaya) and the definitive good (nges legs, ni~sreyasa) are, respectively, the temporary and ultimate goals of religious striving. High rebirths comprise the human, titan (asura) and god (deva) realms of sarp.sara, which, though at least as pleasurable as painful, still can is-sue in rebirth in any of the three lower realms, those of animals, hungry ghosts and hell denizens. The definitive good is a level of attainment from which there is no return to sarp.sara. From the Mahayana point of view, this includes both the nirvar:a of a Hinayana arhant and the omniscient enlightenment of a buddha. Within the lam rim anthropology that rGyal tshab rje derived from Tsong kha pa and Atisa, higher rebirths are the goal of persons of small scope, while the definitive good is the goal of persons of medium and great scope.

This crucial concept, which grounds inference in the commonly observ-able nature of things, and is a token of Dharmaldrti's epistemological realism (perhaps even foundationalism), is discussed by him in the Pariirthiinumiina chapter of the Pramiir;aviirttika, verses 48-71.

A cognition of a patch of blue is immediately and self-evidently authoritative, so the apperception of that cognition cognizes not only the cog-nition's contents, but its nOh-deceptiveness, too. On the other hand, a cogni-tion of fire on a distant hill is subject to subsequent confirmation or disconfirmation, and thus is not immediately and self-evidently authoritative. Thus, the apperception of that cognition cannot cognize the cognition's non-deceptiveness, because the non-deceptiveness-although it is actual-has yet to be confirmed. 3 The TIbetan actually reads ma khyab, or \"nonpervasion,\"which translates the Sanskrit avyapti, but its sense is khyab chung, underpervasion, a condition in which a definition fails to cover all possible instances of the phenomenon defined, and therefore is inadequate.

It attains its object in this sense, not in the sense that it necessarily apprehends anything beyond the mere word, such as, e.g., the word's referent object-which, the opponent correctly notes, one cannot attain through a mere word. S Thus, all types of sense-cognitions are covered by the auditory example. A vis-ual cognition that mayor may not authoritatively ascertain lightning still is authoritative in its apprehension of a visual object (as opposed, say, to a hal-lucination). 6 We cannot infer the reality of a phenomenon simply from the fact that there exist words that express it, for there is no absolute connection of either cau-sality or synonymy (the two chief logical relations in Buddhist epistemology) between words and things. Not everything for which we have a name actually exists. In the case under discussion, the words \"high rebirth\" and \"definitive good\" are verbal entities, and so have as their cause not the reality of the con-ditions described, but simply the speaker's desire to express them. 7 The reason's relevance to the subject (phyogs chos, paJa;adharma) is one of the three characteristics required of a correct logical reason. The other two are the reason's invariable concomitance with the predicate (rjes khyab, anvaya) and the reason's invariable non-concomitance with the non-predicate (ldogkhyab, vyatireka). I have generally translated the latter two, respectively, as positive and negative concomitance.

If (b), that ascertaining authority will also require ascertainment as non-deceptive by another, subsequent [authority], and since that [authority] will depend on still another, there will be an infinite regress. 10 In other words, authority accomplishes direct results because, as above in the case of aural cognition, authority sometimes resides simply in the nondecep-tive cognition of a knowledge-object. Direct knowledge of non-deceptiveness entails direct knowledge of authoritativeness. 11 Superimposition (sgro 'dogs, aropa) generally refers to philosophical hyposta-tization, the superimposition of a metaphysical entity where there is none. It is used frequently in Madhyamika texts, where it refers to the view that there exists an inherent self in the aggregates or dhannas. Here, the tenn simply re-fers to a cognition that is the contradictory of an authoritative cognition. If I am to cognize authoritatively that a lamp is white, I must have a mind that newly cuts off, oris able to cut off, the possibility that it is non-white. Thus, my authoritative cognition of the lamp as white is actually a cognition of it as non-non-white.

Furthermore, the hypothetical definition of self-ascertain-ment is insufficient because it fails to specify that a self-experiencing apper-ception must experience not only its own essence but, specifically, non-deceptiveness. The hypothetical definition of other-ascertainment is in-sufficient because it fails to specify the need for a subsequent designation (tha snyad) to assist in confirming the cognition that cannot induce certainty by its own power. 15 Devendrabuddhi's point (PVP 220/3-4: rGyal tshab rje has paraphrased) seems to be that the authoritativeness of any cognition (even an appercep-tion) is dependent upon a subsequent designation for its ascertainment as authoritative. 16 The following paragraphs are an attempt by the opponent to show the inco-herence of the concepts of self-and other-ascertainment, through a highly specific analysis of the various options entailed by the concepts, which are seen to lead, inevitably, to dilemmas. rGyal tshab rje will not comment in de-tail on the dilemmas posed by the opponent, but will, rather, restate their defi-nitions. . 17 The Tibetan actually reads yul can, \"object-possessor.\""},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Definition and Examples of Authority 183 authority, such as [the cognition] apprehending blue, is either able or unable to ascertain itself independently, [yet] it is unreasonable to dis-tinguish between these two, because it is impossible that an externally directed cognition, such as [the cognition] apprehending blue, could know itself; and because unless a self-experiencing apperception that just exists [simultaneously with the cognition of blue] independently [ascertains the cognition as authoritative], that [cognition] will be un-suitable [to be considered] an authority.

Rather, it reflects the particular concern of rGyal tshab rje and other commentators (e .g., Prajilakaragupta) for whom the Bud-dha's authoritativeness is coextensive with his omniscience. The analysis seeks to establish that the Buddha's omniscience fulfills the definition of authority as new, nondeceptive cognition. The problem the opponent will pose is that since anewly omniscient mind cognizes all phenomena of the past, present and future directly and simultaneously in its very first moment, all subsequent moments must be subsequent cognitions, hence not authori-tative. The essence of rGyal tshab rje's reply will be that subsequent omnis-cience-moments are authorities because phenomena continually change their status, and those changes of status are cognized newly. 34 According to Mahayana soteriological writings, there are two classes of obsta-cles to be eliminated before buddhahood is attained: defilement-obstacles (nyon sgrib, kleso.varalJO.) and knowledge-obstacles (shes sgrib, jfieyavaraYfa). Elimina-tion of the former-and with them the roots of ignorance, attachment and aversion-is a prerequisite for any liberated state, be it that of a sravaka, pratyekabuddha or a buddha. Knowledge-obstacles, which are merely the subtle traces of uprooted defilements, must be eliminated before one can gain the full omniscience of a buddha; they still remain in sravakas and pratyek-abuddhas. In most accounts of the Mahayana path, a bodhisattva has elimi-nated defilement-obstacles by the end of the seventh stage (sa, bhilml), and from that point through the end of the tenth stage, progressively eliminates the knowledge-obstacles.

[RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] This is the reply to be made to that: The sec-ond omniscience-moment either (a) arises or (b) does not arise immediately after the first omniscience-moment. If (b), then it is nec-essary to accept [the first moment] as permanent. If (a), then since the second and subsequent moments cognize newly [what was cognized by the first moment], it is necessary to accept that they are authorities. [OPPONENT:] Since the first omniscience-moment cognizes [the content of] the second and subsequent omniscence-moments as yet-to-arise,35 there is nothing to be cognized again [newly by the second and subsequent moments]. [RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] When there is such cognition, the second and subsequent moments either have or have not already arisen.

It is the path on which most of the work of uprooting defilements is accomplished, via deep meditation (sgom) on the nature of re-ality. In the Mahayana tradition initiated by the Abhisamayalatrlkilra, the path of development coincides with the last nine bodhisattva stages, the first coinciding with the path of seeing. Incidentally, a \"path\"in this sense comprises a series of mental states of a particular type. 38 The path of seeing consists of sixteen \"moments,\" or time-divisions, and marks the point at which a meditator first applies the union of tranquillity and insight (gzhi gnas [hag mthong gzung jug, samathavipasyanayuganaddha) to-ward the salvific truth emphasized in their system. In Mahayana, this salvific truth is voidness (stong pa nyid, sunyata), which is interpreted in Yogacara to be the voidness of a substantial difference between subject and object, and in Madhyamaka to be voidness of any inherently or naturally existing substance in either persons or dharmas. It is only at the point where one cognizes the truth directly that one begins to uproot-as opposed to suppress-the defile-ments that, together with karma, keep us circling in saf!1sara. Attainment of the path of seeing makes one an arya, or \"noble,\" possessing the \"eye of Dharma.\"It should be noted that in the Sautrantika system, with which Dhar-makirti was associated, one cannot directly perceive a negation, or absence, such as that of inherent existence. Thus, the attainment of aryahood is marked for a Sautrantika not by a direct cognition of no-self, but by a direct cognition of, e.g., the aggregates as no longer qualified by a self; no-self thus is realized implicitly, not directly. For rGyal tshab rje, who is a Prasaitgika Madhyamika, . there is no such qualification: voidness, no-self, or any other negation can be cognized directly. See Sopa and Hopkins (1976) 105 and Klein (1986) passim. 39 Dharmata is a venerable and malleable term, whose general sense is simply \"the way things are.\"Since different Buddhist schools have differed on \"the way things are,\"the term has been used in many ways. rGyal tshab rje here is using the term in its Prasangika Madhyamika sense, as voidness of inherent"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"192 Is Enlightenment Possible? cognized, because there is no diminution of the cognition of dharmata already effected during the path of application,40 which is [the path of seeing's] cause.

Dharmakirti, were he to employ the term, would more likely use it to refer to no-self, or perhaps to the lack of a substantial difference between subject and object. 40 The second path, that of application, or linking (sbyorlam, prayogamiirga), is that which leads one to the threshold of the direct cognition of reality afforded by the path of seeing. It consists of four stages, which mark the increasing in-tensity of one's analytical understanding of reality. The path of application is preceded by the path of accumulation (tshogs lam, sambhiiramiirga), on which one familiarizes oneself with the basic types of meditation, both concentrative and analytical. Entrance into it is marked in the Abhidharmakosa system by at-tainment of a spontaneous desire to be fully separated from saI!lSara, and in the Abhisamayiilarrzkara system by attainment of a spontaneous desire to achieve enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings, i.e., bodhicitta. 41 One way to describe the path of seeing is to say that it is the point at which dharmata becomes a manifest phenomenon for one, rather than a hidden phenomenon; on the path of application, it is merely inferred, while on the path of seeing, it is directly realized. 42 This rather sophistic argument by the opponent plays on the definition of\" ex-ists.\" A future object cognized by an omniscient mind is seen to exist as future; since to say that something \"exists\"is to say that it has already arisen, it fol-lows that a future object has already arisen.

Just so, knowledge-objects are impermanent and God's cognition is unstable, but he [himself] is a permanent cognizer God.52 [RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] It follows that, BECAUSE his earlier and later [cognitions] are THINGS THAT ARISE SUCCESSNELY, God's cognition CAN-NOT BE ACCEPTED TO ARISE FROM A PERMANENT God.53 [A permanent God] cannot generate [cognitions] in dependence upon conditions, BECAUSE IT IS UNSUITABLE THAT a permanent [entity] DEPEND on condi-tions.54 Also, if the function of the eye does not [change into] something dissimilar, it must already apprehend a later [object] when it apprehends an earlier one.55 51 In other words, if the opponent admits that there is a permanent conventional authority that is to be refuted, and that that conventional authority is, e.g., a permanent authoritative cognition such as that attributed to God, then what permanent authority could there be that is different from this such that it could be called \"ultimate\"and stand unrefuted? The question is rhetorical, be-cause the opponent cannot, in fact, specify a permanent \"ultimate\" authority that is any different from what is admitted to be conventional and refutable. 52 This argument seems to appeal to a notion somewhat like that of the Aristo-telian \"unmoved mover\": God is essentially unmoving, but there is an aspect of himself that, in contact with the contingent universe, moves. In Indian terms, the argument is that God is essentially permanent but that his cogni-tions are impermanent. 53 It is a contradiction in terms that impermanent cognitions arise from a perma-nent source. 54 If the opponent argues that God is permanent and his impermanent cogni-tions generated not directly from him but in dependence on conditions, they are open to the reply that God cannot be subject to external conditions, or he loses his self-sufficiency. Furthermore, impermanent conditions cannot affect a permanent God any more than impermanent cognitions can arise from him. 55 This argument is typically and fundamentally Buddhist, and is crucial to the establishment of the doctrine of momentariness. Its basic formulation is clearly stated by Koller (1970 [154-155]): \" ... both terms of the following dis-junction are false: either the action of causation is instantaneous and com-plete, or else it is temporally extended.

Furthermore, if the action were instantaneous and complete, the question would arise as to whether the permanent exists after the first moment of change-if it does, then it should give rise to the same effects as it did in the first moment, and the same for each succeeding moment. But this is absurd, for it results in an infinity of complete universes. If the permanent continues to exist after the first moment of causation but not as a cause, then apparently it changed from a cause to a non-cause. Since it is not possible for a self-contradictory thing to exist, such a reality is not possible. The alternative to instantaneous and com-plete causal action is temporally extended causal action. This view is unten-able also, for if it were the case that the permanent cause produced first x, then y, and then z, etc., it could be asked whether or not y or Z could have been pro-duced while x was being produced. If the answer is affirmative, it would tum out that all the effects were producible at once, and this alternative would be incHstin-guishable from the first. But if the first cause could not produce effects y, z, etc., at any given time, say when x was being produced, it would be impossible for it to cause them at any later time, for what is not capable of producing a given ef-fect at a given time cannot produce that effect at any other time, except by as-suming other causal activity .... Even if it is admitted that certain modifications in the cause are required, the Buddhist argument is successful, for this is an admis-sion that the cause has changed. But if the cause has changed, then there are really two things: the cause prior to change and the cause after change. To admit that the substance changes as it produces effects is to deny permanence and to admit different existences at different moments. And this is in accord with the doc-trine of momentariness which the Buddhists wish to support.\"If one substi-tutes \"cognition\" and\" object\" for\" cause\" and\" effect\" in the preceding passage, its applicability to the problem at hand is clear. 56 \"Homogenes\" (rigs lira, svajati) are previous and subsequent instances of the same type of entity as that being discussed.

To arise thus is to be imperma-nent, but to be impermanent is also to be subject to helping and hindering causes and conditions, yet the opponent insists that their God is both imper-manent and free from causes and conditions such as those found in saI!lsara, and that he always has been so. rGyal tshab rje is arguing that it is meaning-less to use the terms \"arisen\"and \"impermanent\"of an entity and then deny to that entity those characteristics that in part define being arisen and imper-manent, i.e., susceptibility to hindrance or assistance by external causes and conditions. It might be noted parenthetically that a Western conception of an impermanent God that might escape the net of Buddhist criticism is the \"process\"theology exposed in the works of, e.g., Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. In process theology, God is an ever-changing, non-om-nipotent force that requires the assistance of particular entities for the unfold-ing of its divine nature and purposes-a conception not entirely different from the Mahayana conception of a buddha. 58 The reason cited by rGyal tshab rje as proving that an impermanent God can-not be an authority, namely, \"because he has not been aided in any way\" (rnam 'gas phan gdags bya min phyir = kathaficinnopakaryatuad), is taken by Deven-drabuddhi as a proof that permanence is impossible: if the opponent argues that God is permanent but generates impermanent cognitions assisted by causes or conditions, this is simply another way of saying that he is depend-ent, and a permanent being cannot depend on anything.

If it is proven that [knowledge objects] are produced by a pennanent mind, then it follows that THE EXAMPLE of that reason IS UNPROVEN, because it is impossible that there exist a permanent functioning entity.61 59 This is an Indian statement of what is known in the West as the teleological argument, or the argument from design. It is similar, if not identical, to syllo-gisms developed in the Nyaya-Vai§e~ika system of Indian philosophy. For the best analysis of Nyaya -Vai§e~ika theology, see Vattanky (1984). For a lucid dis-cussion of the Western form of the argument, see Hospers (1967) 455-78. The second of the three reasons, \"because they have particular shape, like a pot,\" closely resembles Western arguments from design, with the pot serving the same analogical function as a watch has in some Western arguments. The third reason, \"because they achieve purposes,like a battle-axe,\"seems to echo a more strictly teleological argument, of the sort proffered by Aquinas as the fifth of his\" five ways.\" The first reason seems linked to the third. The argument from particular shape is refuted in verses 11-20, the argument from intermittence in verses 21 and 23, and the argument from purpose in verses 22-26. 60 A syllogism, in order to be a true syllogism, must demonstrate something not already demonstrated; if it merely restates what has become axiomatic, it is adding nothing to our store of knowledge. The Buddhists maintain, and are content to have proven already, that worldly abodes, bodies and enjoyments are preceded by mind, i.e., by the karmic intentions (sems pa'i las, cetana) of those beings who use them, so if the theist is merely proving in a general way that they are mind-preceded, nothing new has been proven, and the syllo-gism is irrelevant. How the Buddhists have proven it, rGyal tshab rje does not say, but it is possible that they must do so at least in partial dependence on the authoritative word of the Buddha (who alone is an authority regarding the subtleties of karma). Since the Buddha's authoritativeness is at issue, it is pos-sible that rGyal tshab rje is begging the question.

One cannot, however, simply take the word \"shaped/which belongs to the first proof, and apply it to proving that abodes, etc., are created by God.

Although the word \"physical\"is applied by one of the dispu-tants, it is unproven that it is commonly agreed upon by the disputants. The Vai§e~ikas assert that all knowledge-objects are collected into six categories: substance, quality, generality, particularity, action and inherence. Substance [is divided into] non-ubiquitous substances, viz., the four elements and mind; and four ubiquitous substances, viz., self, time, direction and space. Of the six categories, it is quality [that includes] size. If we divide size, there are big and small and long and short. Big [is divided into] permanent and impermanent. The perma-nent bigis a quality based on a substance that has parts and is composed of three or more atoms. The small is divided [in the same way].

Of course, only an impermanent entity can thus change its nature: seeds and sprouts, and sense-faculties and their objects are imperma-nent, and thus capable of changing nature; God, as a permanent entity, is not. 95 As in a number of previous instances, the Tibetan sgrub byed carries the double sense of\" accomplish\" and \"prove.\"Because there is no way of\" accomplish-ing\" omniscience, omniscience has no identifiable cause.

It follows that mental cognition cannot be [omniscient], because it follows on sense-cognition. It follows that even if the mind relies on scripture it cannot cognize all hidden phe-nomena, because [words] are not necessarily related to meaning-and even if they are, one will not cognize [the meaning] directly.96 Moreover, it follows that it is unacceptable that one cognize all knowledge-objects successively, because if that is the case, you must accept that there is an exhaustive limit [to phenomena].

There is no absolute ontological connection between words and things, and even if there were such a connection, knowledge gained through words still would be indirect, and thus not of the most certain kind. 97 The Mimarytsaka is driving home the logical consequences of claiming that all phenomena can be cognized. To say that all phenomena are cognized succes-sively is to imply that there is a limit to phenomena. If phenomena are-as generally believed in Indian philosophy-infinite, then it is theoretically im-possible to cognize all phenomena successively, for there always will be a new phenomenon to cognize.

They are presentnei-ther in Dharmakirti's verses nor in Devendrabuddhi's commentary (PVP 224-225). Explicitly at least, Dharmaklrti is concerned not with proving the Bud-dha's omniscience, but his authoritativeness. On the evidence of Dhar-makirti's writings, his attitude toward omniscience seems to have been ambivalent at best. Indeed, it is possible to construe the following section as an attack on the idea of universal omniscience (sarvi'iki'irajfiati'i)i at the very most, it is an attempt to establish knowledge of what is to be adopted and what rejected as the sufficient condition of a being's authoritativeness for those intent on freedom.

Indeed, it is with this observation that the discussion of the Buddha as \"one who has become an authority\" concludes. Whether or not a buddha's authoritativeness is coextensive with omniscience is problem-atic.

Since these two categories are exhaustive of all phe-nomena, knowledge of what is to be adopted and rejected in regard to them will be knowledge of everything. 107 Dharmakirti here seems to be clearly distinguishing between omniscience and authority-in Western terms, he is pointing out the difference between \"knowledge\"and \"wisdom.\" 108 This discussion, which is added by rGyal tshab rje, not only describes another type of \"omniscience,\" that is useless for those intent on freedom, but raises what in Western philosophy is called the \"problem of evil\": why should we follow a teacher whose creative abilities extend to the manufacture of tor-tures? rGyal tshab rje, of course, is assuming that the omniscience of the teacher in question is limited to their creative prowess, and that they do not know, e.g., how all things really exist and how sarpsara is engaged and disen-gaged.

To prove that the Bud-dha is the teacher for those intent on freedom, one must establish a motive, which is the compassion out of which he seeks and finds a method for pacifying suffering. which method he then is able to teach to others. 4 Compassion is the seed from which the entire Mahayana path flowers. In Candrakirti's Madhyamakavatara,for instance, the initial homage is directed not-as is customary-to a deity, such as Mai'tju§ri, but to compassion itself. See Poussin (1907-11), Hopkins (1980) 101ff. and Huntington (1989). The term \"Mahayana path\"is used by rGyal tshab rje in a general sense: in order to enter the first of the five \"paths\"of the Abhisamayalaf!1kara path-system (that of accumulation), it is necessary not only to have generated compassion (the de-sire to see others freed from suffering), but great compassion (the desire to free them oneself) and, ultimately, the thought of enlightenment (byang sems, bodhicitta), which is the aspiration to highest enlightenment so that one may assist other beings. It might be noted parenthetically that, in line with the \"ge-neric\"Buddhism being presented here, Dharmakirti nowhere specifies that he is discussing\" great\" compassion. 5 \"Savior\"is the last of the five epithets, so in the forward system of explanation, \"he is the savior\"becomes the logical thesis, for which \"compassion\"will serve as the first in a chain of\" establishers/' or reasons.

Similarly, then, mind is a \"quality\" of the body or brain-a certain set of dispositions, as Ryle would put it-and not a substance.

IS Also, [mental inclinations, etc.,] DO NOT ARISE FROM JUST THE elemental BODY ALONE, BECAUSE they arise from pre-vious homogenes of mind, etc. If such is not the case, there follows the EXTREME CONSEQUENCE that all the elements are living beings, because mind arises from the elements alone.19 16 A moment of breath, sensation or thought is known in general to be preceded (directly or indirectly) by a moment of the same type: indeed, all things have as their substantial cause (nyer len gyi rgyu, upadiinahetu) a preceding event of an appropriate or similar type. Thus, the syllogism proposed is correct, be-cause breathing, sense-clarity and mental inclinations all are phenomena that are known to follow on homogeneous causes. Thus, even the \"first\"moment of breath in this life must be preceded by a breath-moment from a previous or intermediate-state existence. 17 That breath, etc., arise from homogeneous causes is demonstrated by the fact that (a) except at the time of birth, whenever there is a breath-moment, it has been observed to have been preceded by a breath-moment (positive con-comitance) and (b) except at the time of death, whenever there is no breath-moment, no previous breath-moment has been observed (negative concomitance). The fact that homogeneity has obtained during life should in-sure that it obtains before birth and (in most cases) after death. 18 The observation of positive and negative concomtance (rjes su 'gro Idog) be-tween the reason and predicate is fundamental to the inductive generaliza-tions that form the basis of correct reasoning. 'Without positive and negative concomitance, neither general nor particular conclusions may be drawn about causal relations, so all causal inference would be pointless. 19 If mind arises from the elements, and mind is characteristic only of what is liv-ing or sentient, it follows that the elements must be sentient.

It also is unacceptable [to assert] that LATER, at the time of an ordinary being's death, their sense-faculties, etc., do not make a CONNECTION with subsequent homogenes because of SOME reason such as the LACK of some part of the cause, because at that time the homogeneous causes are complete; and in the past WE HAVE SEEN THAT THAT previous homo-gene HAS THE ABILITY TO CONNECT with a subsequent [homo gene ] and that it is unacceptable that there exist any other additional cause.20 In summary, the mind of a just-born ordinary being follows on pre-vious homogenes, because it is a mind.21 The death-time mind [of] that [ordinary being] connects with a subsequent mind, because it is an attached mind.22 spelled out in greater detail below, is a hidden presupposition of this and many other Buddhist attacks on materialism. 20 If breath, etc., are observed during this life to follow in a homogeneous causal series, then not only is it legitimate to infer that the first breath of this life must have been preceded by a homogeneous cause, a breath, but also that the last breath of this life must be followed by a homogeneous effect, a breath. As rGyal tshab rje notes, the validity of these inferences is based on the fact that, apart from the observed homogeneous cause of a breath, we do not see any other additional cause. This being so, what is good enough for this life ought to be good enough for previous and subsequent lives. The assertion that there is no additional cause-even in the form of a necessary condition-seems problematic: functioning lungs, for example, seem at least as indispensable to breath as a \"previous breath.\" Of course, if homogeneity is required, and the lungs and breath are considered to be heterogeneous, this objection cannot apply-but this heterogeneity has not yet been established, so the Buddhist may not be able to appeal to it without begging the question. 21 This syllogism follows the same form as that of which breath, etc., were sub-jects. The initial syllogism merely paved the way for this one, by establishing an observable example oia homogeneous causal series. Once the notion of a homogeneous causal series has been established, it can be applied to a subject somewhat less open to general inspection: the mind. Essential to this view, of course, is the notion that mind, like matter, can be logically analyzed into in-stantaneous, efficient events. If this is the case, then mind too must consist of a homogeneous causal series. Whether mind is, in fact, in the same ontologi-cal category as matter (what might be called\" substance\" [rdzas, dravya]), and thus analyzable \"atomistically,\"is not a question that seems to have beenex-plicitly raised in Indian philosophy, though as indicated above, there may be suggestions of it in some materialist analyses. 22 The qualification, \"attached\"mind, will be explained in greater detail below. It is necessary to specify\" attached,\"because the mind of an arhant, who is de-tached, does not, according to the Sautrantikas, connect at death with a sub-sequent mind, because the arhant will enter parinirv?il!a, which for the Sautrantikas is a totally negative state."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Mind-Body Problem (1) 229 [OPPONENT:] All the elements are not living beings, because those 'that are unable to generate sense-faculties and mind in stone, etc., are not living beings.23 [RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] It follows that ALL the elements HAVE THE NA-TURE OF BEING SEEDS of living beings, because WHERE IS THERE A PART OF THE EARTH and other elements THAT COULD NOT BECOME AT SOME TIME THE SOURCE OF HEAT AND MOISTURE-born beings, ETC.?

They do not, however, provide any criterion for distingUishing life-bearing from inanimate elements, and therefore leave themselves open to refutation. A modem, scientifically trained materialist is able to appeal to the notion of different levels of organization of matter, and thereby to provide a plausible-if not indisputable-explanation of how some \"elements\" generate life while others do not. 24 Moisture-birth is one of four different types of birth recognized in Buddhism, the others being birth from the womb, birth from an egg and miraculous birth, such as is taken by the gods. Birth from moisture is similar to the now-discred-ited Western concept of spontaneous generation. rGyal tshab rje is arguing against his opponent that it is impossible to divide something as fundamen-tally simple as the elements into life-bearing and inanimate parts: if some parts of the elements are life-bearing, then all must be. 25 What is living, rGyal tshab rje maintains, only can come from what is living. If the elements are the cause of a living being, then they must be living to begin with.

Whether genetic the-ory can account for all physiological and behavioral traits is problematic. Karma, on the other hand, can explain all such traits, but the obscurity of its' mechanisms and its ubiquity make its usefulness as an explanatory principle something less than ideal, even for those scientists well-disposed toward non-materialistic explanations. In this sense, karma poses explanatory prob-lems not unlike those posed by the concept of God, who is equally obscure and ubiquitous. 28 This summarizes the Buddhist view: appealing to the elements alone as causes of living beings does not provide us with adequate criteria for distin-guishing the living from the non -living-and the distinction must be made, as it is evident from observation that there are in the world both animate and inani-mate objects. 29 rGyal tshab rje is arguing against the idea that the mind is directly dependent on the activities of the senses. He cites as proof the fact that we see many cases where a person whose sense-faculties have been impaired suffers no impair-ment of their higher mental functions.

For example, a moment of desire-whatever the proximate external conditions-has as its antecedent some previous moment of desire or attach-ment. Even the first instance of desire after birth, e.g., for the mother's breast, must have a homogeneous cause, and therefore must be traced to instances of desire or attachment in a previous life. 32 A \"projecting cause\" ('phan byed kyi rgyu) is, in effect, an indirect substantial cause or indispensable condition.

A physical sensation of touch is followed by an awareness of that sen-sation. The awareness of the sensation can lead to a mental cognition, e.g., the .. thought, \"I am being touched,\"but the sensation does not lead directly to the mental cognition. Mental cognition only can be preceded by another mental cognition or by a sense-cognition; these are considered to be the \"faculty\"or \"organ\" (dbang indriya) of mind. Further, even sense-cognitions do not have the sensations as their substantial cause: they arise on the basis of cognitive capacity when a sense-faculty encounters a sense-object and attention is ap-plied. It might be noted that in Theravada abhidhamma, mental cognition, like the sense-cognitions, has a material basis, the hadayavatthu (lit., \"heart-sub-stance\"). See Karunadasa (1967) 62££. Whatever the basis of a mental cognition, Buddhist views of the mind-body relation tend to be interactionist, maintaining that the mental and physical are alike in being causally conditioned types of phenomena, but heterogeneous enough in nature that the one cannot be the \"direct special basis\"(Le., substantial cause or indispensable cooperative condi-tion) of the other-rather, they interact indirectly. The dualism seems rather more pronounced in Dhannakirti's system than in Theravada, but some sort of dualism is fundamental to the establishment of past and future lives (after all, the body dies, while the mind, in some sense, continues), and few Buddhists will want to disavow it entirely."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Mind-Body Problem (1) 233 Disposing [of the objection that] it contradicts reason: [OPPONENT:] IF THERE IS NO occurrence of MIND without the sense-faculties, it must be based on the body.

The establishment of mutual dependence is undesirable for the materialist, because such a situation goes against the unidirectional (material to mental) causality they wish to establish. 37 This argument parallels almost exactly the one used above (section III:2:C) to refute the existence of a permanent God who is the cognizer or creator of im-permanent phenomena. It is, quite simply, a contradiction in terms for a non-successive entity to produce successive phenomena, whether that non-successive entity be God or a body. 38 This argument, too, is similar to one used against the idea of a permanent creator God, who cannot be said to depend on conditions, because depend-ence on conditions is impossible for a permanent entity."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"234 Is Enlightenment Possible?

Nothing can be said in defense of rGyal tshab rje's opponent, though it might be noted that an opponent who actually argued for the existence of a permanent body might be rather difficult to find-unless in a Buddhist caricature of another school's position. Certainly it is an argument that seems to have little contempo-rary relevance. 40 Restated syllogistically, the proposition is as follows: an ordinary being's death-time mind does not connect with a subsequent homogene, because it is a death-time mind, like a detached one's death-time mind.

Granted, the existence of a liberated being is not the point at issue here, but the opponent's acceptance of one aspect of the Buddhist world-view would-assuming its essential coherence-tend to make acceptance of other aspects of it more likely. In this case, the concept of an arhant cannot be understood without recourse to a concept of sa~siira from which liberation is possible, and sa~siira entails past and future lives. 45 The remainder of this section is taken up with a digressive discussion of vari-0us problems involved in the acceptance of the finality of an arhant's death-time mind, a topic not covered by Dharmakirti. 46 The reason, as already noted, is uncertain because not all minds connect with a subsequent mind, the death-time mind of an arhant being the exception. 47 One must, in other words, either take or leave Buddhist writings. If one ac-cepts them, one must accept both the existence of arhants and the continu-ation after death of an ordinary being's mind.

Nor, for that mat-ter, does he accept an arhant's final mind: he believes that, after death, an arhant's mind continues, endlessly purified of defilement, never taking birth again, but not ceasing, either. 52 The belief in \"three final vehicles\"is characteristic of some Yogiiciiras. It entails the assumption that each of the three spiritual goals-sriivakahood, pratyek-abuddhahood (which two together comprise arhantship) and buddhahood-is an end in itself.

Conscious thought is not necessary for breathing to occur. If each breath necessitated an immediately preceding thought, there could not be breathing during deep sleep, but since such imme-diacy is not the nature of the relation between mind and breath, there is no problem. 73 rGyal tshab rje here makes the general point-in support of his specific obser-vations on breathing-that a cause and effect need not-indeed, they cannot co-exist: a cause always precedes an effect; when the cause is present, the efc fect has not yet arisen, and when the effect has arisen, the cause is no 10n2:er"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Mind-Body Problem (1) 247 It would follow [from your previous assertion] that THE INCREASE .

There may be some connection between the two, but from the Buddhist point of view, the causal direction is the opposite of that posited by the matedalist: it is mind that is the special principal condition of breathing. 75 Quite simply, if breath is the substantial cause of mind, and the body is the substantial cause of breath, then the presence of the body in the case of a corpse should necessitate the presence of breath, and the presence of breath should necessitate the presence of mind. rGyal tshab rje has added numerous glosses to the original1ibetan, which simply says that the consequences (thaI ba) would be the same (mtshungs) with regard to those (de dag), i.e., breathing and mind. 76 The opponent argues that if mind's presence can be projected by previous karma, it can be present in a dead body. rGyal tshab rje replies that this is not the case, because the karma that projects the co-existence of mind and body ceases to function at the time of death."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"248 Is Enlightenment Possible?

Since the term for \"humor\" (nyes pa, do~a) is the same as for\" defect,\" or\" fault,\"it sometimes is ambiguous which is intended. Here, \"defect\" seems to accord better with the sense of the passage. 78 Although rGyal tshab rje will refute this objection, the general point seems well taken: it is not simply the body that is the indispensable condition of mind; it is the body's proper functioning, represented by a proper balance among the humors. A modem materialist might argue in the same vein that mind has as its indispensable condition a properly functioning brain. 79 rGyal tshab rje here is raising the point that, in effect, death is the end of dis-ease. If disease-in this case, a severe imbalance among the humors-is said to cause death, then when the result, death, exists, the cause must be absent, so disease will, as it were, \"deteriorate\"in a dead body. Though technically cor-rect, this reply seems a bit sophistic, playing as it does with definitions of cause and effect. There is nothing to indicate that the humors are either balanced or unbalanced in a dead body; indeed, the concept of humors only is relevant to a living body, as is the concept of disease.

Without the admission of factors other than the dis-ease itself, the opponent cannot assert that any disease cannot be cured. 86 This is a way of making the same point as above: if the cause of mind is the body, and the cause of the body's death, poison, can be removed, then the body ought to be revived and mind present in a corpse from which the poison has been removed, because the substantial cause is present and the contradic-. tory conditions absent. As above, rGyal tshab rje's argument seems a bit so-phistic, but as long as the opponent identifies the causes and conditions as they do, their position will be vulnerable.

It is problematic whether this refutation can as easily be applied to the brain, for, as far as neurophysiologists are aware, there is no mental event that is not-at the very least-correlative with neural activity in the brain; a transformation in the brain invariably will produce transforma-tions of \"mind,\" and no mental event can occur without the \"transformation of\"-Le., without activity in-the brain. The problem of the substantial rela-tion between mind and brain also raises problems, it not being at all obvious how mind can be described in \"substantial\"terms. On the other hand, the ma-terialist position is not without its difficulties, too, the most obvious being how mental functioning can be explained purely on the basis of physiology. Here, as elsewhere in this section, fundamentally opposed concepts of \"mind\" and \"substance\" are at work, and it is not clear that either position is incontestably demonstrable. 89 Molten copper, though seemingly\" one\" collection, in fact consists of a fire ele-ment and a copper element. Since fire and copper are substantially different, the one cannot be the substantial cause of the other. On the other hand, they co-exist because the one acts as the cooperative condition (lhan cig byed rkyen, sahabhupratyaya) of the other. Fire, thus, has a previous moment of fire as its substantial cause and a previous moment of copper as its cooperative condi-tion. Copper has previous copper as its substantial cause and previous fire as its cooperative condition.

The ex-planation given by the Buddhist-in terms of successive moments-is the only one that can account for two substantially different entities acting as sup-port and supported. 101 These are three of the six a priori categories (pado.rtha) recognized in the Vai§e~ika system. The six are: substance (dravya), quality (gul'}a), action (kanna), generality (so.mo.nya), particularity (vise~a) and inherence (samavo.ya). See Vaise~ika Sutra 1:1:4 (tr. Radhakrishnan and Moore [1957] 387), Dasgupta (1975) I,313ff. and Koller (1970) chapter 6. These concepts are introduced here. because the Vai§e~ikas maintain that, e.g., qualities are related to substances as supported to support. 102 The Vai§e~ika categories, therefore, cannot even be said to be supported in a conventional sense, for a pot, e.g., acts to prevent the spilling, falling, or flow-ing of the water inside it. Something that spills, falls or flows necessarily is im-permanent, and thus conventionally can be said to require a support. The Vai§e~ika categories, however, are permanent. They do not change from mo-ment to moment, let alone spill, fall or flow, so they cannot be described as supported, even by the entities in which they are said to inhere. Furthermore, as we have seen above, there cannot be a connection between a permanent and an impermanent entity, so it is impossible for the Vai§e~ika to explain how the categories can inhere in impermanent entities. 103 A somewhat more straightforward reading of the Tibetan of the verse ('dis ni 'phrod pa 'du ba yang / 'ph rod pa 'du ba can rgyu dang / rigs la sags pa mam gnas nyid / rten med phyir na gsal ba yin) yields: \"This clears away [the idea that] there is inherence, inherent cause and the abiding of generality, etc., because"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Mind-Body Problem (1) 259 THIS reasoning,104 which refutes the existence of a basis for the abiding of an already existent entity, also CLEARS AWAyl05 [the idea] . that there is INHERENCE [connecting] substance and quality, AND that substance is· THE CAUSE OF HAVING the [co-] INHERENCE of qualities, BE-CAUSE it has been shown that something that already exists DOES NOT HAVE A BASIS of its abiding.106 It follows that it is unacceptable to say that if there is no cause of having inherence, then there cannot be inher-ence, because even without a refutation of [particulars], UNIVERSALS, ETC., DO ABIDE.107 Alternatively, one can apply the first reason [in the previous para-graph] to the statement, \"There is no basis of the abiding of an already existent universal.,,108 This also clears away [the idea] that there is a cause of inherence [connecting] body and mind, [for] one can apply to that [idea] the reason set forth in relation to substance and quality.l09 [one] cannot be the basis [of the other].\" 104 \"This reasoning\"refers to the statement (above, PV 63) to the effect that there is no point in either a non-existent or an existent entity's having a simultane-ous cause of abiding. 105 In GI, bsal probably is preferable to gsal. 106· Inherence is conceived-at least in the Buddhist reading of Vaise?ika-as an essentially causal factor, for it \"causes\" universals to inhere in particulars.

Additionally, the Vaise?ika categories cannot function causally because they are conceived as permanent, non-successive \"entities.\" (Whether a Vaise~ika would accept the Buddhist's analysis of their categories in terms of \"entities\"is open to question. They might insist that by doing so the Buddhist is committing-pardon the expression-a category mistake.) 107 The opponent attempts to claim that if there is no simultaneous, substantially different cause of inherence, then there can be no inherence at all. Yet, rGyal tshab rje points out, the Vaise?ikas themselves assert that universals exist in-dependently of their particulars, so it is unnecessary for them even to posit the existence of inherence. 108 The syllogism thus would read: \"The particulars are not the basis of the abid-ing of an already existent universal, because even without particulars, univer-sals do abide.\" Since the existence of universals is not dependent on their connection with particulars, the particulars cannot be said to be the basis of the universals' abiding."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"260 Is Enlightenment Possible?

Such, in any case, is the dilemma posed by Dharmakirti's reasoning, which clearly relies heavily on an application of the Indian equivalent of the \"law of the excluded middle\"-entities are either naturally destructible and momentary or abiding and per-manent; there is no \"middle\"altemative. 113 A cooperative condition (lhan cig byed rkyen, sahakaripratyaya) is in general an assistant condition, as soil, moisture and sunlight are to the growth of a plant.

[These assertions] only [reflect] the dis-torted understanding that misconstrues how a collection is formed.12 This \"whole\"is a fundamental assertion of the Vaisel?kas, but when the Lokayatas assert that the body is the special basis of mind, they are partly refuted by an analysis of the essential [aspect of] body that acts as a basis, [so] the Lokayatas are the opponents in this verseY blue, the former on the basis of the fact that a part has been painted, the latter on the basis of the fact that the whole has not-for by the opponent's own ad-mission, the whole is partiess, and thus not logically separable from any parts. 10 This, then, is the Buddhist position: there is no whole above and beyond the sum of its parts, for if there were, then the consequences outlined above would ensue. 11 Even if there exists a gross external object with parts, one discovers upon analysis that the ultimate parts of a gross external object are atoms. A gross object is visible and tangible, and thus has qualities that are contradictory to those of its parts, atoms, which are invisible and non-resistant. For the Vaise!?ika, then, a whole must be substantially different from its parts. 12 rGyal tshab rje criticizes two views: (1) that a gross object does not have sub-stantial existence and (2) that a collection and its parts are substantially differ-ent. A gross object does have substantial existence, because it can be an object of cognition. At the same time, the collection and its parts are not substantially different, because if they were, then the problem of the co-existence of con-tradictory qualities in a unitary collection, raised above, would remain un-solved. 13 The actual position being refuted in this section, rGyal tshab rje reminds us, is that of the Lokayatas.

They only serve to set one predicate or quality apart from other possi-ble predicates or qualities. Specifying the \"form\" of the pot, therefore, excludes as a possible predicate any other quality of the pot. 47 The phrase, \"the conjunction of fingers,\"has the specific purpose of identify-ing one predicate of \"fingers\" for someone who wishes to know just that predicate of \"fingers\"and no other. There is no other way that this can be ex-pressed except genitively, yet it does not entail an ontological distinction be-tween the fingers and their conjunction. 48 Expressions in which the predicate is the base, e.g., \"the conjunction of fin-gers,\" exclude all other possible predicates by making one predicate the gram-matical subject. Expressions in which the subject is the basis-and therefore also the grammatical subject-e.g., \"the fingers are conjoined,\"do not exclude other possible predicates, for fingers just as easily can be long, short, white or black. 49 Thus, the general purpose of applying different predicates and types ofpredi-cate-sentences to an object is to enable one's listener to know either one or a number of predicates of an object, depending on what the listener desires to know and/or the speaker desires to communicate. rGyal tshab tje's approach here is a very \"pragmatic\"one-he simply does not share the Vai§e~ika's ob-"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"286 Is Enlightenment Possible?

There is (1) collection without genus, as in the expression \"Mt.

Since these two bases are iden-tifiable' it is not the same thing to say \"pot\"and \"the form of the pot,\"but the difference between these does not entail the existence of ontologically distinct referents. 54 Depending on one's point of view, \"pot\" is either a collection-expression or a genus-expression. In the expression \"the form of the pot,\"it excludes any predication other than the pot's form, and thus is a collection-expression. In the expression \"the golden pot,\"it does not exclude particular attributes, for it is known to be golden. In the latter case, then, \"pot\"is a genus-expression. 55 (1) \"Mt.

The two types of expression function in different ways and, being purely semantic distinctions, they need have no ontological over-tones such as the Vai§e~ika would like to import. 57 To reiterate, then, the purpose of an expression such as \"the form of the pot\" is to distinguish-for someone who wishes to know-a specific quality (the form) of a general collection (the pot). 58 Again, in an expression such as \"the smell of sandal,\" the smell is the gram-matical subject, i.e., the \"particular base\" (khyad gzhi), and the sandal is its \"particular predicate\" (khyad chos). The phrase is a particular grammatical ar-rangement that fulfills a particular grammatical need, i.e., the need to specify the smell of sandal from among all other possible predicates.

The basic contention is that mind has material origins but, once established, has quasi-independent existence within its own realm. 75 The Buddhist reply is to point out that there is no reason why the body, if it once has the capacity to generate mind, should, at a certain point, cease to generate it, particularly since it is constantly present and the conditions that enabled the initial generation of mind have not been removed.

Since the body's strength or weakness does not thus affect mind, the body is not a special co-operative condition of mind. 81 See PV Svarthanumana:39-184, and Zwilling (1976)."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Mind-Body Problem (2) 299 parents bodies exist, the previous-life body [of the child] should ex-ist. 62 .

They need not do so, however. If a being is about to be born into the desire realm again, their previous karma assures that their death-time mind does have the capacity to act as the cooperative condition for the next life's body.

They either (a) directly generate the first-moment ma-terial sense-faculties of the subsequent desire-realm life or (b) stop before the final mind of the formless-realm birth.

The causal efficiency of the final faculties of the previous desire-realm life somehow continues through the formless-realm life until its final moment when, in combination with the final mind-moment of that existence, it generates the faculties of the subsequent desire-realm life. 94 The opponent's position is unreasonable, because if the causal efficiency of the final faculties of the previous desire-realm life is said to persist through the formless-realm life, then a permanent cause is being asserted. If the efficiency does not persist, then the final faculties of the previous desire-realm life can-not be the direct substantial cause of the faculties of the subsequent desire-realm life, because they already have ceased before the final moment of the formless-realm life, when they would have to be present in order to act as a di-rect substantial cause."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"304 Is Enlightenment Possible? interpret the passage found below: \"Because [the object] is absent at that time, [a result] does not [arise] from that object.\"95 [OPPONENT:] Since the final material sense-faculties of the pre-vious [desire-realm life] exist as [ready to generate] the first-moment material sense-faculties of the subsequent [desire-realm] life, the rea-son is unproven.96 [RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] Well, then, it is necessary to consider: How do you explain the fact that at the time of birth from the desire realm into the formless realm, the mind continues independent of the body, as demonstrated by [the fact that] that death-time body does not ob-tain a renewed direct capacity to generate a subsequent body?97 [OPPONENT:] Therefore, the substantial cause of the subsequent [desire-realm] body still remains in doubt.

If faculties have not arisen, the preceding-moment faculties must not have had the capacity to generate faculties, so they cannot have been the direct substantial cause of any subsequent faculties. 98 If one argues that, since the final faculties of the previous desire-realm life and the first faculties of the subsequent desire-realm life are not separated by any other physical moments, then the former can be the direct substantial cause of the latter, then the same objections as above apply: the final faculties of the previous desire-realm life must be either a permanent cause or have ceased before they can di-rectly generate the initial faculties of the subsequent desire-realm life; and, in any case, since they do not generate faculties in the next instant, they cannot be described as a direct substantial cause."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Mind-Body Problem (2) .305 mind of the formless-realm being.

This seed is momentary throughout the formless-realm life, but its capacity is undiminished from moment to mo-ment. It is not material-despite its capacity to be the substantial cause of something material-because it is classified as a \"non-associated composi-tional factor\" (ldan min 'du byed, viprayuktasar:zskara), which is neither mental nor material, but can, in any case, exist in the formless realm. See AK ii:35-48 (tr. Poussin [1923-31] 1,178-244) and, e.g., Sopa and Hopkins (1976) 70-71. 100 The problem that rGyal tshab rje has outlined is similar-but not exactly par-allel-to that of explaining how awareness is possible after deep sleep. Just as the final faculties of the previous desire-realm life cannot be regarded as the direct substantial cause of the first faculties of the subsequent desire-realm life, so the final moment of awareness before deep sleep cannot be regarded as the immediately preceding condition of the first moment of awareness after waking, because, quite simply, it does not immediately precede it. What is the immediately preceding condition of the first moment of awareness after wak-ing is an \"unclear\" or subtle consciousness that continues-momentarily, of course-through deep sleep. The unclear cognition that is an immediately preceding cognition has the same function as does the \"seed\" of the sense-faculties that continues through the formless-realm life. The philosophical problems posed by the two cases are somewhat different, and two slightly dif-ferent types of causes are involved, but the analogy nevertheless is illuminat-ing.

On the contrary, given that mind is endless, there is no reason why clear cognitions should not be endless, too. A buddha, of course, is a be-ing whose every cognition is perfectly clear and stable. It should be noted that the validity of the Buddhist hypothesis rests on two assumptions: an infinity of lives in which mental qualities can be developed (presumably demon-strated just above), and the natural increase of positive qualities, based in turn on the assumption that stability and clarity are/can become the mind's natural states. Stability and clarity are the mind's natural state (cf. PV 207 -8 and R. Jackson 1990) in that they are the fundamental nature of mind, adventitiously ob-scured by defilement. They can became the mind's natural state in that one can -on the basis of accustomation through meditation -thoroughly imbue the mindstream with them. 7 It is assumed that because they are generated with a stable basis, instances of various positive mental qualities have the capacity to generate increasingly in-tense, or \"exceIlent\"instances of the same quality.

Neither this objection nor rGyal tshab rje's reply is contained or im-plied in Dharmaldrti's root-verse. 33 According to rGyal tshab rje, the Buddha may rightly be regarded as omnis-cient because (unlike arhants) he has been able to familiarize himself over the course of countless lives not only with the essential details of saf!1sara and nirvana, but with all the details. Since samsara and nirvana (= what is to be re-jected and what adopted) are categories exhaustive of all phenomena, if the Buddha knows sarp.sara and nirvfu:1.a in all their details, he is by definition om-niscient. Cf. above, section III:2:D and R. Jackson (1987) for material relating to Dharmaldrti's attitude ,toward omniscience. 34 Because his mind is utterly clear and purified, the Buddha may be said to have eliminated not only the causes of suffering, but also the latent dispositions or propensities (bag chags, viisanii) to originating the cause. This distinction, basic to Mahayana, is not spelled out explicitly by Dharmakirti's verse.

Indeed, he would not attain his own aim were he not already compassionate, for, in Mahayana theory, full buddhahood only can be attained when motivated by the altruistic aspiration to enlightenment (bodhicitta). This seems to raise a paradox: one only can attain one's own aim by considering the aims of others; yet in considering the aims of others, one may be said to be considering one's own aim, so one may be selfish and thus unable to attain one's own aim!

Loosely speaking, these paths are the\" causes\" of the cessation of suffering that is identified with the fifth path, that of no-more-training (mi slob lam, asai~amarga). 38 rGyal tshab rje replies to the opponent's objection about the identification of the teacher by pointing out that one must distinguish between conventional and ultimate teachers. Granted, the ultimate teacher is one who has com-pleted their training in method and wisdom. However, the method and wis-dom that are developed while one is still on training-paths are the causes of the ultimate teacher, hence may themselves figuratively be spoken of as teachers. Among the four epithets that demonstrate the Buddha's authorita-tiveness, those that represent the excellence of results are the sugata (which is excellence of one's own aims) and the savior (which is excellence of others' aims). The causes of these results are the excellence of intention (which is compassion) and the excellence of application (which is the wisdom realizing no-sel±). The description of \"method\" as the teacher is intended to include both method and wisdom. Thus, \"method\"includes the excellences of both in-tention and application, thereby fulfilling Dignaga's definition. 39 The Tibetan of PV 119a reads: grub las dang po 'byung ba .... The reading of the line depends on whether one takes as the subjects the excellences of intention and application or of one's own and others' aims.

A Prasari.gika Madhyamika, such as rGyal tshab rje, would define the knowl-edge-obstacle as non-defiled ignorance regarding the inherent voidness of all phenomena. The ignorance involved in a knowledge-obstacle is \"undefiled\" because defilement already has been abandoned. It is ignorance that has understood the essential to be understood, but not all the details. The ig-norance involved in the defilement-obstacle, incidentally, would be iden-tified just as above by the various schools, but with the proviso that it is defiled ignorance, wherein one has not grasped the essential point. 43 Because Dharmakirti is interested in establishing the lowest common de-nominator for liberation, he discusses no-self in terms of the no-self of per-sons, and the obstacles in terms of ignorance of the four noble truths-with the aspect of no-self the most crucial.

The reason why it has dispensed with the origination of suffering is that it results from an application of the antidote to the origination of suffering, namely the wisdom realizing no-self. Non-Buddhist teachers, since they do not realize no-self, do not possess the true antidote, so their abandonment of the defile-ments that are the causes of the origination of suffering cannot be a complete one. They cannot cut the root of sal!lsara, and so are not liberated. This will be proven in greater detail below, sections HI:1D-l1.

The word \"or\" [in the root-text] includes as abandonments the re-spective abandonments on the paths of seeing and developmentY According,to acihya Devendrabuddhi, when one interprets the quota-tion as \"because of seeing no-self and [because of] reasoning,\" reasoning is praised because it is through the accustomation of the wisdom realizing no-self by the method that sees [no-self] through reasoning, that [the Buddha] is the sugata.48 [OPPONENT:] What is the irreversible abandonment byabandon-ing which one does not revert [to sa~sara]? [RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] A streamwinner who will have seven [more] existences is EXPLAINED AS someONE WHO WILL REVERT to sa~sara, be-cause it is explained that the suffering of continuous BIRTH, AND FLAWS such as attachment, etc., WILL ORIGINATE for seven more existences. The foregoing [ultimate] abandonment is a SUGATAHOOD that IS IRRE-terpretations. The first, listed here, is that the Buddha's abandonment is good and retains no basis for further suffering because it is the result of a good method, Le., the seeing of no-self, which is synonymous with the excellence of application. The key to this interpretation is the rendering of the Sanskrit yukti (usuallyT. rigs pa) as sbyor (which usually translates prayoga). If yukti = sbyor, then it is possible to interpret it as referring to the excellence of application (prayogasampat, sbyor ba'i phun tshogs), which is, of course, synonymous with the realization of no-self, and is the connotation of the Buddha-epithet, \"teacher.\" 47 A second way of interpreting the basis of the Buddha's abandonment's good-ness is to say that it is a result of the abandonments of defilement-and knowl-edge-obstacles that occur on the path of seeing (mthong) and development; the latter is implied by the word \"or\"('am, va). It must be noted, however, that the Tibetan mthong here translates dr~tva, lit., \"having seen,\" not darsana, which is the Sanskrit term used when the path of seeing is the topic. The five paths are nowhere in the Pramat;tasiddhi chapter explicitly mentioned by Dharmakirti. 48 A third way of interpreting the basis of the Buddha's abandonment's good-ness is that of Devendrabuddhi (PW244/4/6), who takes yuktias \"reasoning,\" in other words, as rigs pa rather than sbyor ba. Thus, the goodness of the Bud-dha's abandonment derives from the fact that it results from the accustoma-tion of the antidote, the wisdom realizing no-self. No-self first is cognized by reasoning. This cognition eventually leads to a direct, non-conceptual realiza-tion of no-self. The direct, non-conceptual realization of no-self is the excel-lence of application, and is the basis for the abandonment of defilements. Accustomated on the paths of seeing and development, that realization even-tually issues in buddhahood, in which all obstacles have been abandoned. The wisdom realizing no-self through reasoning thus is an indirect cause of the sugata, or of the abandonments that comprise sugatahood."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"The Buddha's Qualities 331 VERSIBLE, BECAUSE [in it ONE] HAS utterly ABANDONED THE SEED THAT IS THE SELF-VIEW, together with the propensities thereto.49 [OPPONENT:] How does the wisdom realizing no-self damage self-grasping?

[RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] The wisdom realizing the no-self of persons directly damages the grasping at a self of persons, because it is directly contradictory BY WAY OF HAVING the NATURE of a DIFFERENT manner of grasping [reality], one THAT IS a subject that has a TRUE and right man-ner of grasping [reality].51 49 A second special quality of the Buddha's abandonment is that it is irreversible (slar mi gshegs pa, apunariigama). One who has the abandonment of a buddha never again will return to saITlsara, whereas there are beings whose abandon-ments are such that, although they are destined for enlightenment, they have not yet run the course of their saITlsaric existences, for they have not aban-doned all defilements. Examples of the latter are the three lower classes of Hlnayana aryas, the streamwinner (rgyun zhugs, srotiipanna), who will attain arhantship after a maximum of seven more saITlsaric existences; the once-re-turner (len cig phyir 'ong ba, saJo:diigamin), who will attain arhantship after at most one more saITlsaric existence; and the non-returner (phyir mi 'ong ba, aniigiimin), who will attain arhantship from a divine abode after the end of their present saITlsaric existence. According to the Abhidharmakosa path-sys-tem (AK vi), the \"fruits\"of the streamwinner, once-returner and non-returner are attained on the paths of seeing and development, while the first moment of the fourth fruit, arhantship, coincides with the path of no-more-training. Neither bodhisattvas nor those with the three lower Hinayana fruits have ir-reversibly abandoned saITlsara; arhants and buddhas have. 50 The opponent is arguing that if self-grasping and non-self-grasping are de-fined as contradictories, then each should be able equally to damage the other. Thus, there should not be any reason why self-grasping-once replaced by non-self-grasping-might not in tum replace the non-self-grasping that re-placed it. The objection presumably is not just a philosophical appeal to sym-metry; it is based, too, on the observation of the mental states of ordinary beings. 51 The very important reply here is that although self-grasping and non-self-grasping are contradictories, they are not symmetrical, or equally weighted, because the former is a false manner of grasping reality, while the latter is a true manner of grasping reality, and where the truth has become securely es-tablished, falsehood cannot again take root. Thus, non-self-grasping can re-place self-grasping, but self-grasping cannot replace non-self-grasping.

All we really can observe of other people, such as those we meet on the road, is that they speak and have bodies and sense-faculties. We know that most people who have bodies and sense-faculties and speak have not abandoned suffer-ing, and there is no additional information provided by observation of alleged buddhas that would guarantee that they are any different from other people we encounter. 55 The opponent's argument is uncertain for the simple reason that there is no invariable concomitance between speakership and the possession of sense-faculties on the one hand and the quality of having eliminated or not elimi-nated flaws on the other. To argue that the Buddha has not eliminated flaws because he has body and speech is to cite insufficient evidence, for it is not im-possible (a) that someone with an \"impure\"body or speech have a mind that has eliminated flaws or, more importantly, (b) that there exist someone whose body and speech are not flawed in the slightest.

If one argues that the Buddha has not abandoned flaws because his speech is pure only on the basis of what he has been taught by past teachers, or because he speaks with attachment, the syl-logism lacks negative concomitance (/dog khyab, vyatireka), for there is no in-variable concomitance between one's having eliminated flaws and one's not being a speaker, or one's being non-attached. Generally speaking, the fact that one possesses body and speech does not automatically entail that one's body or speech are either pure or impure, for instances of both are held to be possible. 57 \"Those who say that the Buddha's physical form is not the Buddha\"include the Vaibha~ikas, who claim that only the Buddha's mind is truly the Buddha, and that his body and speech are the impure residue of past karma. This po-sition opens the way for the rGyal dpog pa objection just raised. In general, Mahayanists accept that the Buddha is his body, speech and mind, and that all aspects of him are pure. His mind, which is equivalent to the Dharma Body, is the pure result of the storage of gnosis 0Je shes kyi tshogs, jfiiinasambhara)i his speech and body, which are (roughly) equivalent to the Enjoyment and Trans-formation Bodies, are the pure result of the storage of merit (bsod nams kyi tshogs, pU/!yasambhara).

His search for and accustomation to the antidote (the wisdom realizing no-self) is motivated by his desire to help free all beings. His successful development of the antidote issues in his aban-donment of all faults, or sugatahood, a condition from which he actually is able to help free all beings, just as he had originally intended-and one of the methods by which he helps free beings is teaching the path. 61 It cannot be the case that the Buddha teaches distortedly (or invertedly: phyin ci log par), because he has been shown to have abandoned all flaws. He has been shown to have abandoned all flaws because he has accustomated to the ultimate degree the antidote to the origination of suffering. AI:, one who has abandoned all flaws, Le., as a sugata, he is free from error. Thus, when he teaches the path to others in his capacity as savior, he cannot possibly do so distortedly. 62 It cannot be the case that the Buddha does not possess the great compassion that has others as its intentional object, because it already has been shown that great compassion can be accustomated infinitely over a series of rebirths, and that it is the motive on the basis of which bodhisattvas exert themselves in the discovery and development of the antidote to the origination of suffer-ing.

Even prior to one's development of compassion, one enters the paths so as to become an authoritative person, i.e., in order to become knowledgeable about what is to be rejected and what adopted for religious purposes. Still, compassion is the first in the chain of reasons that demon-strate that one actually can become a savior, which is equivalent to an authori-tative person for those intent on freedom. Furthermore, from rGyal tshab rje's perspective, compassion is the first point on the Mahayana path that leads through teacherhood (paths of seeing and development) to sugatahood (path of no-more-training and Dharma Body) and saviorhood (Form Bodies). 68 Thus, the Buddha is an authoritative person for those intent on freedom, be-cause he can and does teach the path to liberation unmistakenly. He is able to teach the path unmistakenly because he has completely abandoned all faults that would hinder his complete knowledge of what is to be rejected and what accepted on the path. He has abandoned all the faults because he has cog-nized and fully accustomated the antidote to all faults, the wisdom realizing no-self. He has cognized and accustomated the antidote because he wishes to aid all sentient beings. He develops the desire to aid all sentient beings after first having set out to become an authoritative person so as to know how to free himself from saf!1sara.

It also may be read as supplying an altemative reason why the Buddha is a savior, it already having been established that he is one because he is compassionate, the teacher and the sugata. 3 By definition, a savior is someone who can lead others to freedom or salvation. The Buddha has attained freedom himself, has formulated his knowledge of the cosmos in the four noble truths, and teaches those truths to others. If the four noble truths are, in fact, true, they will be the basis of the attainment of freedom for those who subscribe to them. If they are true, they will stand up to the tests of perception and inference. If they stand up to those tests, then the status of savior will reasonably have been attributed to their teacher, the Buddha. Thus, the reverse system of explanation will concentrate on estab-lishing the truth, or actuality (gnas lugs) of the four noble truths as the way of establishing that their propounder teaches saving knowledge, and thus is a savior. The cause of the Buddha's authoritativeness has been shown by the for-ward system, which described his progress from compassionate one to savior. The reverse system will show the reason for the Buddha's authoritativeness, the truth of his basic teachings. 4 As before, the\" general meaning\" consists of introductory material furnished by rGyaltshab!je, the \"meaning of the limbs\" of commentary on Dharmakirti's text."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"The Four Noble Truths in General 341 from sa~sara; and the truth of cessation, which is the essential result, freedom.

The assumption of such a division appears at first to beg certain questions, for the establishment of its validity would seem to hinge upon the validity of the four noble truths, which remains to be decided. Perhaps the difficulty can be overcome by arguing that the validity of the twofold division is not presupposed, and that the division represents in a general way the categories, hence the line of inquiry, that would naturally oc-cur to anyone who was concerned with suffering and its elimination. 6 If one were to teach the truths in the order in which they actually occur, i.e., with cause preceding result, then one first would describe origination; then its result, suffering; then the path; then its outcome, cessation. Traditionally, of course, the truths are taught from result to cause, in the pairs suffering-origi-nation and cessation-path. This accords with the way in which they are actu-ally cognized, for their discovery is an inferential process, and inferences proceed from result to cause, not the other way around. 7 One realizes upon even superficial investigation that the desired elimination of suffering is no simple matter, like the plucking out of a thorn.

The path is divis-ible into fifteen \"moments\": one realizes one aspect of each of the truths ex-plicitly (the others are realized implicitly); each of these four explicitly realized aspects is realized with respect to the desire and \"upper\" (form and formless) realms of sa~sara; each realm-realization is divided into an uninterrupted \"path\" and a \"path\" of liberation (or accomplishment). Four aspects with respect to two realms each in a sequence of two paths each yields sixteen \"moments,\"but the path of liberation with regard to the upper realms in respect of an aspect of the truth of path is counted as the first moment of the path of development. 12 Only the suffering of suffering (sdug bsngaZ gyi sdug bsngaZ, du~khadu~kata) covers what in the West is usually thought of as suffering, for only it is mani-festly painful. The suffering of change ('gyur ba'i sdug bsngaZ, pari1Jamadu~k­hata) seems to be pleasure, such as that derived from the anticipation and consumption of a huge meal, but it is suffering because it eventually will be re-placed by the suffering of suffering. For example, our hunger and greed will lead us to overeat, which will result in indigestion, an instance of the suffering of suffering. The suffering pervading formations, also known as pervasive suf-fering (khyab pa'i 'du byed kyi sdug bsngaZ, sa1!lskaradu~khata) is, in effect, the suffering nature of all beings (or aggregate-possessors) whose actions still are contaminated (zag bcas, sasrava) by defilements, and who therefore will con-tinue to take uncontrolled rebirth in sa~sara. Obviously, this broad definition of suffering presupposes the validity of the division of the cosmos into s~sara and nirval!a, for only in a cosmos thus structured would the second and third types of suffering be regarded as suffering.

It has the aspect of (4) definitive emer-gence, because it is a dharmic liberation that is irreversibleY The aspects of path: The wisdom directly realizing no-self has the aspect of (1) path, because it is a path that leads to liberation. It has the aspect of (2) reasonableness, because it acts as a direct antidote to defilement. It has the aspect of (3) accomplishment, because it is the gnosis that perceptually cognizes the ultimate actuality of mind. It has the aspect of (4) definitive removal, because it is a dharmic antidote that cannot revert to suffering.20 the origination of suffering is in part under the sway of particular cooperative conditions, such as craving for existence, it cannot be asserted to result from any sort of permanent being. such as God, because such a permanent being could not generate particular sufferings in accordance with varying conditions and still remain a permanent being. According to Vasubandhu, the aspect of condition counters the view that things come into being preceded by an intel-ligent creator-when, in fact, they come into being through a multiplicity of causes and conditions. 19 (1) The fact that cessation is cessation, and therefore is the abandonment of suffering. counters the idea that cessation never comes about. (2) The fact that cessation is peace, and therefore is the abandonment of defilements, counters the view that some state in which defilements (nyon mongs, kleSa) or contami-nants (zag pa, asrava) still remain can be the cessation that is sought. Accord-ing to Vasubandhu, the aspect of cessation as peace counters the view that cessation somehow entails suffering. (3) The fact that cessation is sublime, and therefore beneficial and pleasurable, counters the idea that just the ces-sation of some particular suffering can be the supreme cessation. The Sanskrit term for this aspect, prmJita, simply means \"supreme,\" and thus is taken by Vasubandhu as countering the idea that particular cessations, such as those entailed by the dhyanas and samapattis (in which, in fact, all defilements have not been eliminated) are the supreme cessation. The Tibetan translation of prar;.ita, gya nom pa, is somewhat more ambiguous, as it implies both supe-riority and pleasure. Thus, it may be taken not only as countering the view that a cessation in which defilement remains is the supreme cessation, but also as countering the view that the cessation that is nirvaJ!.a is merely an absence, devoid even of pleasure. This latter wrong view, incidentally, is like that attrib-uted to some Sautrantikasi it is unclear whether Dharmaklrti subscribed to such a view. 20 (1) The fact that the path has the aspect of being a path counters the idea that"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"The Four Noble Truths in General 347 The eight aspects of suffering and origination are taught by individ-ual. divisions in the text [of the Prama1}avarttika].

Because the wisdom realiz-ing no-self sees reality as it actually is, it has the power to eliminate defilements, and so it reasonably is asserted to be the path, for the path is sim-ply the process of eliminating defilements until the cessation of suffering is at-tained. According to Vasubandhu, the aspect of reasonableness counters the idea that a false or unreasonable path is the path to cessation. (3) The fact that the path entails accomplishment counters the idea that some particular samadhi is the path, for ari \"accomplished\"realization is a complete one, and only a complete realization will have the power to eliminate defilements and thus merit identification with the path.

The ba-sis from which one strives for the great aim is a \"perfect\"human rebirth, which is, negatively speaking, free from certain hindrances, such as being born in the divine or lower realms where Dharma practice is difficult, being born on earth in places or times where the Dharma is unknown, or being oneself a heretic or idiot. Fbsitively speaking, a perfect human rebirth involves being human, being born where the Dharma is known, possessing clear faculties, having committed no inexpiable crimes, having confidence in the moral practices enjoined by the Vinaya, practicing the Dharma assiduously at a time when it still is taught purely, and developing compassion. For this basic category of Tibetan lam rim thought, see, e.g., Sgam po pa (1970) chapter 2 and Dhargyey (1974) 42-52. 25 The vices, sometimes called \"sins\" (sdig pa) are: killing, stealing, sexual miscon-duct, lying, harsh speech, slander, gossip, covetousness, malice and heterodoxy.

Thus, a moment that never has been experienced before must not be sa~sara. The opponent, of course, misunderstands sa~sara's \"repetitive\"nature. One certainly repeats types of experiences-those of a particular realm, and even particular experiences within those realms-but one never repeats experiences in all their particulars. The conditions of particular \"repeated\"experiences invariably will be somewhat different from one instance to another. At the very least, an experience will be unique be-cause it occurs when it does, and not at some earlier or later time. 3 The assertion that a permanent person is, or is the basis of, s~sara, is made by most non-Buddhist schools. A Buddhist will reject it on the grounds that a permanent entity cannot undergo the transformations that suffering is ob-served to entail. 4 Attachment, anger and other defilements are just like the positive qualities of compassion, wisdom, etc.: their substantial causes are previous instances of the same sort of mental attitude. This is shown by the fact that-just like the positive attitudes-they increase or decrease depending chiefly upon the de-gree to which they are accustomated. If defilements increase or decrease through accustomation, and if mind is independent of body, then defilements must have existed beginninglessly.

For a discussion of the medical tradition, see, e.g., Dasgupta (1975) voL II. 7 The opponent's reason is uncertain, because there is no invariable concomi-tance between the preponderance of a particular humor and the expression of a particular defilement. Thus, a person who shows clear physical signs of be-ing dominated by phlegm should be expected to be lustful or attached all the time. In fact, however, we observe that such people often may display little de-sire and much anger-which we would expect only of a bilious person.

Thus, a preponderance of bile has among its results not only anger, but prematurely white hair, jaundice, excessive perspiration and a cer-tain mental clarity.

Put in somewhat more modem terms, rGyal tshab rje's argument amounts to this: the mere fact that one has a body cannot ex-plain why one's body is the size it is; that must be explained through addi-tional factors, such as heredity (in this case, karma) and nutrition (or conditions). Similarly, the fact that one expresses particular emotions cannot be explained by the general fact that one has the potential to express various emotions; that one expresses various emotions only can be explained by other conditions, such as one's previous expression of them-and also perhaps by heredity. 13 rGyal tshab rje here is repeating the same general point he has made before, that there is no invariable concomitance between the humors and the defile-ments, and he cites as a demonstration the fact that an increase in phlegm, which should automatically entail an increase in attachment, sometimes weakens the body, and that in that case, attachment is observed to decrease."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"The Truth of Suffering 357 Proving [that the reason is correct in all three} ways14 [204} (15'Od) ...

It cannot be that anger is generated from all the humors, though, because then each of the humors should be capable of generating all of the defile-ments, and the predominance of one humor then would entail the generation of all the defilements, which manifestly does not occur. 17 The previous basic reason is the assertion that defilements do not result from the humors because their invariable succession on the humors is uncertain. 18 There are results that directly follow an increase in one of the humors: fever, for instance, will increase following an increase in bile.

Thus, females are capa-ble of attachment and lust, too-though Dharmakirti and rGyal tshab rje clearly intend males in this section.) According to rGyal tshab rje, the oppo-nent's reason is uncertain, for there is no invariable concomitance between an equilibrium of the humors and attachment, or semen and attachment. First, attachment is known to arise not only when the humors are in equilibrium, but also when they are in disequilibrium-as in the above-cited case of an ex-cess of phlegm. Second, there are beings whose humors are in equilibrium-such as aryas-who do not develop attachment. Third, attachment is not observed automatically to decrease in people whose semen has been depleted through, e.g., the loss of blood (the connection between blood and semen is an ancient Indian medical notion). A man who has lost semen through the loss of blood should not, by the opponent's theory, feel lust for a beautiful woman, but this is not observed to be the case. Fourth, semen is not certain to in-crease in every case of attachment. Therefore, attachment must be the result of something other than semen. In modem terms, lust is as much a matter of mind as of hormones. 22 The opponent's attempt to argue that beauty is the cause of attachment also fails, because-again-the concomitance between the supposed cause and result is uncertain: there are cases in which men do not generate attachment to women acknowledged to be beautiful, and also cases in which they gener-ate attachment to women not acknowledged to be beautiful. By the oppo-nent's theory, however, all beautiful women should generate attachment in all men, and no non-beautiful women should generate any attachment in any men.

As long as they maintain that, in effect, a beautiful woman is objectively and always beautiful, then any-one who looks at her automatically will hold her to be beautiful, and thus automatically will become attached. Thus, the problem is not resolved, but merely removed one step. Cf. TS 1952. 25 Another consequence of the opponent's original contention-that there is an invariable concomitance between an increase in a particular humor and the increase of a corresponding defilement-is that someone who is phlegmatic could not ever be angry, because the predominance of phlegm should assure constant attachment, and attachment and anger are contradictory qualities: one cannot exist in the same time and place as the other.

This common-sense view; the basis of our instinctive mind-body dualism, is asserted by Dharrnakirti to be supported by the obseIVation of an unmistaken cognition.

The validity of this argument hinges on the opponent's assertion of an unchanging body. If the body is held to be momentary in the same way that mind is, then the body is constantly (though subtly) changing all the time, and thus can-at least in theory-serve as the mind's principal condition. A modem opponent would maintain that the brain, as the particular organ that is mind's principal condi-tion, is, in fact, changing just as rapidly as is the mind, so there is no fallacy such that the principal condition is held to \"remain\" while the result changes. 38 Mental cognition, or conceptual thought, cannot possibly be invariably di-rectly influenced by an extemal object, because if it were, then e.g., memory, imagination and dreaming all would be impossible, for these are mental phe-nomena that occur in the absence of any corresponding external object.

In fact, of course, we do not observe that there is any difference in \"aliveness\"between one being and another-a being is either alive or it is not. On the other hand, we do observe a difference in the degree of defilement manifested by various beings. Defilement, therefore, must not come from the elements, but from a previous homogeneous cause. Thus, the causes of the defilements are quite independent of the elements, and the question of whether or not the defilements can be eliminated does not depend on the status of the elements. 47 In other words, if variations in the\" intensity\" of the elements is responsible for the degree of defilement, then in a case where there is no intensity in the ele-ments, or the elements are not playing an active role, there would be no de-filement. This kind of correlation clearly does not obtain-and if it did, ridding oneself of defilement might be as easy as, say, lowering one's metabolism, or losing weight!

That distorted perception is not causeless, because it arises THROUGH A CAUSE THAT IS ATTACHMENT TO SELF.9 8 At numerous places in the sutras (e.g., D, ii, 308) and sastras (e.g., AK v:29), craving is described as threefold: craving for existence, craving for annihilation (or non-existence, or destruction) and craving for sense-pleasure. Dhar-makIrti points out that his description of craving chiefly in terms of the craving for existence does not contradict these passages, for the craving for existence (the main force impelling the continuation of saI]1sara) entails the other two: the desire for objects in general is roughly synonymous with the craving for existence, the specific desire to enjoy objects is the craving for sense-pleasure and the specific desire to avoid objects that cause suffering (or to avoid the suffering connected with objects we desire) is the craving for annihilation. Thus, the two cravings that operate most of the time in ordinary life are the craving for pleasure and the craving for non-pain (=annihilation). One mis-takenly believes that some sort of ultimate pleasure and ultimate absence of pain can be found within saI]1sara, so one generates the craving for further ex-istences. One gets one's wish, further rebirths, and therefore continues to suf-fer. 9 Craving is a\" condition\"for the origination of suffering, because it is the indis-pensable cooperative condition for rebirth into a subsequent existence. Crav-ing for existence involves the mistaken assumption that what is not pleasurable (du~kha) is pleasurable (sukha), and thus becomes the basis for continued rebirth in realms whose nature ultimately is suffering. The root of the mistaken assumption, in tum, is self-grasping, or attachment to self (bdag 'rizin, iitmagraha).

It might be objected that this argument appears to beg the question, for the existence of a being such as an arhant has not yet conclusively been shown (only a proof of the truths of cessation and path can do that), so the opponent need not accept the arhant's attainment as probative of anything, since the arhant has yet to be proved.

For example, when we see [a cause] having the power to counteract a cold touch, we see that there is an elimina-tion of the continuum of horripilation. Similarly, we see that [an antidote] is powerfully destructive of the type of cause that [causes] this aggregation [of suffering] of an ordinary being. This is a correct, objectively impelled reason; its pervasion is proven by perceptual authority.3 Proof of the reason's relevance to the subject: It is necessarily the case that there exists [an antidote] that is pow-erfully destructive of the type [of attitude] that is a distorted attitude toward the actuality of entities. For example, there is the [mistaken] superimposition that apprehends that there is no fire at a smoky pass. Similarly, [the view] that apprehends a self of persons is a distortion of the actuality of entities.4 2 The following discussions of liberation and omniscience are interpolated by rGyal tshab rje, and do not correspond to anything in DharmakIrti's root-text. 3 The process whereby suffering comes to cease can be likened to the process whereby any condition comes to cease. A given condition, such as horripila-tion, is ascertained to result from contact with cold. The application ofthe \"an-tidote\"to cold, heat, is seen to end the horripilation. Similarly, the suffering of sentient beings has been ascertained through the truth of origination to be due to craving rooted in self-grasping. Therefore, the application of the anti-dote (the wisdom realizing no-self) should entail the cessation of the suffering resulting from self-grasping. rGyal tshab rje is maintaining that the \"psycho-logical\" case is no different from the \"physical\": where we can ascertain spe-cific causes for the generation of a particular result, the removal of those causes must entail the non-generation of the result. 4 rGyal tshab rje here uses \"superimposition\" (sgro 'dogs, aropa) in the same rather general sense that Dharmaklrti usually does. Thus, it has not the par-ticular sense of atmavada, but the general sense of any mistaken apprehension of reality, any cognition involving a belief in what is not the case.

[RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] It is proven from the ascertainment that there is no self of persons. This is divided into: identifying the object of refu-tation, the reasoning refuting that [object of refutation] and the way of meditating on no-self. Identifying the object of refutation: This is taught in a later verse,ll [where it says:] A person knows that they have a different Self-nature from their sense-faculties, BECAUSE THEY WILL STRIVE FOR OTHERS THAT ARE SUPERIOR, And because they have a mind subject to arising and destruction. (247c-248b) Innate to one's mind, there is desire for the ownership of an inde-pendent self of persons that is not the collection of aggregates, a single [aggregate] or the continuum. The desirous [mind] does not im-pute only this collection of aggregates as the person, because [we know that] if one could exhange one's present aggregates for special aggregates, such as those of a god, then clearly one would definitely desire to reject the former and accept the latter. Nor, thus, does one impute just mental cognition as exhaustive of the person, because if one could exchange one's present unclear mind for something like an omniscient mind, then, like a merchant [trading] goods, one clearly would desire whatever exhange one could manage.

It is definitely proven by just this statement.14 Alternatively, [the reason,] that which is neither naturally identical with nor different from the aggregates, does not pervade [the predi-cate,] a naturally existing [entity], as the horns of a hare [do not]. It also should be known that there does not exist anywhere an inde-pendent person that is naturally identical with or different from the aggregates. It is easy to ascertain pervasion. As for the relevance of the reason to the subject: there is no natural identity between an inde-pendent person [and the aggregates], because [the aggregates] are under the power of external causes. [The person] does not exist as naturally different from [the aggregates], because if it did, then it would not be seen as other than suitable as an intentional objectY ified merely with one of them is shown by the fact that we entertain such thoughts as, \"If only I could be in his shoes,\" or \"If only I could have a mind like hers.\" A merchant makes a similarly instinctive distinction between a merchant (= the self) and their goods (= the aggregates). If they did not make such a distinction, then they would have no notion of how to obtain the goods belonging to another or to exchange their own goods for those of another, be-cause there would then be no \"other\"with whom to do business. 13 In Mahayana traditions, especially Madhyamaka, the self of persons (gang zag gi bdag) is generally paired with the self of dharmas (chos kyi bdag) as the two possible types of self to be refuted. The most detailed discussions usually are applied to identifying and refuting the former, since it is the more pernicious and difficult to excise. 14 In other words, if there did exist a self that was more than simply an imputa-tion on the aggregates, an authoritative cognition would recognize it. Some-thing that will be cognized by an authority, however, must stand up to analysis, and the concept of an independent self will not, when we search for it, be found. 15 The actual syllogism proving no-self will read: \"An independent person that is naturally identical with or different from the aggregates is not a naturally ex-isting [entity], because it is neither naturally identical with nor different from"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"The Truth of Cessation 395 Based on those two reasons, we have proven the voidness and no-self, that are the special qualities of the truth of suffering, and which cut off the attachment grasping at an imputed self.

When one has meditated thus, and rises from contemplation, by [the meditation's] power one should be-come mentally certain that the so-called \"person\" is merely an the aggregates. Its non-natUral existence is like that of the horns of a hare.\" The syllogism is correct because an independent self cannot, in fact, exist in relation to the aggregates in either of the two possible ways, i.e., as identical to or different from them. It cannot be identical to the aggregates because the aggregates are known to be impermanent and under the power of extrinsic causes and conditions, whereas a permanent self cannot be under the power of anything but itself. It cannot be different from the aggregates, because then the analysis investigating \"persons\"would discover it as an intentional object separate from the aggregates; in fact, however, analysis reveals that all the qualities and characteristics that we usually attribute to a \"person\" are covered by the five aggregates. Therefore, there cannot be any additional factor that \"really\"is the person. Thus, the person is Simply a designation or imputation on the aggregates, nothing more, nothing less, and the search for any other \"person\" or\" self\"is bound to be futile. In the analogy often used by Tibetan teachers, a farmer believes that he has lost a cow, but knows that there are only two places where she might be found; looking in both places, he fails to find her, and therefore concludes that he has not, after all, lost a cow. The ar-gument framed here by rGyal tshab rje is based on such Madhyamika texts as Candrakirti's Madhyamakavatara (sixth chapter) and Santideva's Bodhi-caryiivatara (ninth chapter), See the citations for these works in the bibliog-raphy. See also, e.g., The Dalai Lama (1985) chapter 6, Thurman (1981) III:b and Hopkins (1983) parts one and two, for fuller expositions of these argu-ments. For a concise exposition of Theravadin arguments about the self, see Col-lins (1982) ll:3.2. Incidentally, though the arguments cited by rGyal tshab rje are rooted in the Madhyamaka, there is nothing in them that contradicts anything in Dharmakirti. In this case, therefore, rGyal tshab rje's proof simply adumbrates and adds rigor to Dharmakirti's own discussions. 16 The proof that there cannot exist a self independent of the aggregates pro-vides one with a basis for extirpating the innate self-grasping that is the root of saI!lsara, and therefore with the basis for attaining a cessation of suffering."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"396 Is Enlightenment Possible? imputation on the aggregates. One should remind oneself of this again and again.17 . Therefore, in summary, it is proven by objectively impelled reason-ing that there is a total elimination of the continuum of suffering by virtue of an antidote. That elimination is called \"the truth of cessation\" and \"liberation.\"18 The way of proving omniscience [239] There necessarily exists a type of powerfui destroyer [that exists] in simultaneous combination with the elimination of all destructibles of [the appropriate] type, just as we see that a powerful fire exists in si-multaneous combination with the elimination of all kinds of destructible cold to which it is proximate. The mind that realizes the actuality of the four noble truths, [in such aspects as] no-self, etc., is a powerful destroyer. It is proven by reason of this statement that the mind that understands the actuality of the four noble truths exists in simultaneous combination with the elimination of all destructible stains that [result from] straying from the actuality of the four noble truths. That mind that realizes the actuality of the four noble truths in combination with being devoid of all stains is known as omniscient.19 17 It is through the power of assiduous meditation on no-self that defilements actually will be eradicated. One contemplates it discursively on the paths of accumulation and application. One realizes it directly on the path of seeing, thereby beginning the actual eradication of defilements, and continues to de-velop this realization on the path of development. Throughout these higher paths, the gap between one's direct meditative awareness of no-self and one's conceptual recognition of it when not meditating narrows, until finally, when one is enlightened, one directly realizes no-self at all times. 18 Thus, liberation is proved by the fact that (a) suffering results from misappre-hension of reality, (b) the belief in self is a misapprehension ofreality, (c) belief in self leads to suffering and (d) the application of the opposite of a particular attitude entails the opposite ofits results. As a consequence, (e) application of the opposite to a belief in self entails an end to the results of a belief in self, hence an end to suffering, which is liberation. 19 The actual syllogism on which is based the proof of omniscience will read: \"The mind realizing the actuality of the four noble truths [in such aspects as] no-self, etc., is the type [of entity that exists] in simultaneous combination with the elimination of all destructibles of [the appropriate] type, because it is a powerful destroyer, like a powerful fire, which exists in simultaneous com-bination with the elimination of all kinds of destructible cold to which it is proximate.\"Contradictory conditions, such as the view of no-self and self-grasping, can be related in one of two possible ways.

An\" asymmetrical\" relation is like that between heat and cold: heat steadily applied will eliminate all cold to which it is proximate, and once the cold has been eliminated, it has no power to return-as long as the heat is present. It is a fundamental as-sumption of Buddhist soteriology that the relation between the realization of no-self and self-grasping is of the second, \"asymmetrical\"kind, Le., that once no-self has been\" directly\"realized, it has the power to eliminate any instance of self-grasping to which it is applied. It is, in short, a powerful destroyer. This view may be-although it is not necessarily-related to the equally funda-mental Buddhist assumption that the mind is naturally luminous and free from defilements, which are merely adventitious (below, PV 208c-d). The pre-vailing Western ·view is considerably different: the mind is considered to be fundamentally imperfect and\" defiled,\" capable of development but not per-fection. Thus, the relation between the realization of no-self and self-grasping is more likely to be considered\" symme trical,\"L e., ultimately cyclicaL There is a fundamental disagreement between the Buddhist and the Westerner over the salvific power of \"truth,\"much of which is, in turn, rooted in the differing sorts of\" empirical\" criteria accepted as having confirmatory power: Western assumptions are based more on the observation of \"ordinary\"psychological states, while Buddhist assumptions take into account \"extraordinary\"medita-tive states. For a discussion of these issues, see R. Jackson (1990). In any case, based on the foregoing assumptions, rGyal tshab rje is able to conclude that the \"powerfully destructive\"realization of no-self is able in principle to elimi-nate all instances of self-grasping, and therefore all defilements and residual \"stains\"based upon it. A mind that is free of all possible stains or obstacles is, by definition, omniscient. 20 As rGyal tshab rje already has pointed out, Dharmakirti takes the \"lowest common denominator\"in the PramiiIJasiddhi chapter, and therefore discusses only the no-self of persons. In the Pratyakfa chapter, however, he discusses an object's voidness of substantial difference from the subject that cognizes it, which rGyal tshab rje takes to be his analysis of the no-self of dharmas-from a Cittamiitrin standpoint, of course. Thus, the realization of the no-self of dharmas, a prerequisite for omniscience, is only implied in the PramiilJO.siddhi chapter. If the no-self of dharmas is implied, then so too by extension is \"full\" omniscience, which Dharmakirti nowhere in his writings specifically upholds. Thus, rGyal tshab rje has found in the PramiiIJasiddhi chapter at least two \"im-plicit\"proofs of omniscience: (1) because the Buddha has knowledge of what is to be rejected and what adopted by those intent on freedom, he knows every detail of saJ.!lsiira and nirviil].a, for those are what are to be rejected and"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"398 Is Enlightenment Possible?

Dharmakirti does not re-fute the skeptic here, though he will attempt to do so below (PV 208f£.) , when he argues that the mind is, in fact, intrinsically free of defilement. The Sa:ql-khya is refuted by the observation that the Buddhist is describing an imperma-nent self (that is equivalent to the aggregates), and that while it may be certain that a permanent self described as bound never could be freed, there is no such certainty in the case of an impermanent self. Furthermore, of course, there can be no permanent self that is the basis of bondage and freedom, because the existence of such a self cannot be proven.

That is not all; the authors of the Vinaya Pitaka and its com-mentaries cut off all doubt: when the wealth of the teacher was stolen after he had shown the way to nirval).a, it is impossible that he was the least bit dejected. Since he said \"I\"and \"mine\"before showing the way to nirvana, doubt in this matter can be cut off. I will leave this [matter] for the time being.35 Thus, the view of [self in] the perishable is a grasping at an inde-pendent \"I\" that is not [merely] imputed on some continuum of composite aggregates. Induced by the power of that are two [types of] grasping: grasping at an independent \"I\" and grasping at a \"mine\" to be controlled by that. The [sources of that are] two: conceptually im-puted [grasping derived from] systems of tenets and the innate [grasping] that aris.es without regard to [systems of tenets].36 Without that being the case, if the view of [self in] the perishable is merely the holding of the conception of \"I,\"then it follows that merely holding [the conception of] a person is grasping at a self of persons. If that is asserted, then since thinking \"that person is Devadatta\" or \"[that person] is Yajan\" is grasping at a self of persons, that person [so named] will be the self of persons. If that is asserted, it follows that the aggregates are impossible, because a [permanent] person is impossible.37 35 While ordinary beings' wish for happiness for themselves is indicative of the presence of an innate belief in an independent self, the mere use of the word \"I\" does not prove that the person using the word believes in a self of persons, since the word is used as a conventional designation of their aggregates by arhants and buddhas, whose behavior otherwise reveals them to be utterly free of any self-grasping. 36 Since liberated beings use the word \"I\" as a designation of their own aggre-gates, yet are not suffering in saJ1lsara, the belief in a self that is the basis of s~sara must be something other than just a designation of the aggregates. In fact, the \"I\"belief in which is the basis of saJ1lsara is an \"I\" independent of the aggregates, which entails belief in both an independent \"I\" and a \"mine\" that is controlled by that self. Such belief in \"I\"and \"mine\"can be either philo-sophical or innate-it is the innate belief that is the actual basis of saY!1sara, for, although abandoning the philosophical belief in a self is a necessary con-dition for freedom, it is not a sufficient condition. 37 If belief in a self, or the view of [self in] the perishable, is simply the designa-"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"The Truth of Cessation 409 If there is some flaw in holding the thought of \"I,\" then it follows that there is some flaw in thinking \"I give charity\" or \"I guard moral-ity.\" Thus, if it is proven that the grasping at a self of persons is the mistaken cognition of a desired object, then the mere holding of \"I\" will be [mistaken], too. Thinking that if one accepts a mere \"I\" one must necessarily accept a self of persons, one's mind will be well dis-posed toward the system that accepts a permanent self.38 Objectifying another person, one has the desire to prove that it is independent, not just an imputation on the aggregates-that is grasping at a self of per-sons, but not the view of [self in] the perishable.39 It follows that ANY streamwinner IS WITHOUT ATTACHMENT TO SELF, because they DO NOT SEE AN \"I\" as independent.

Since a self of persons is a philosophically incoherent concept, so too would the concept of aggregates be; thus, the aggregates would be an impos-sibility in the same way that a self of persons is. 38 Again, if merely designating the aggregates as \"I\"is tantamount to holding a self of persons, then saying \"I give charity\" or \"I guard morality\" (or even \"I re-alize no-self\"!) will involve belief in a self of persons, and thus will only serve to perpetuate one's suffering. Such close identification between the conven-tional designation \"I\" and the self of persons, rGyal tshab rje claims, shows that one is actually well disposed toward belief in a permanent self, since any instance of the word \"I\"will entail such a belief. 39 Finally, it must be noted that grasping at a self of persons is a broader category than the view of [self in] the perishable, for self-grasping involves belief in the existence of an independent self not only in ourselves but in others, too, while the view of [self in] the perishable involves the belief in \"I\"and \"mine\"only in relation to oneself. Grasping at a self of others presupposes the view of [self in] the perishable, but it is not that view. 40 Thus, at whatever point a streamwinner has eliminated the innate view that there is a self in but independent of the aggregates, they will abandon the craving for existence-since they no longer deludedly seek the happiness of a phantom \"I.\"When they have abandoned the craving for existence, they no longer will have the cooperative condition for future rebirth.

The Buddhist reply is that the mental transformation signalled by the attainment of a direct realization of no-self is not temporary, but everlasting, and that in such a mind the conditions condu-cive to defilement never will arise again, because the opposing condition to the self-grasping at the root of defilement, namely, wisdom, will continually be present.

Thus, it can be said that \"fundamentally,\"the mind knows things as without self, or even that it knows all things, and thus is omniscient. This observation is closely correlated with the traditional Buddhist account of perception, in which the very first moment of cognition of an object is unmediated and pure, then subject to a posteriori conceptual construction. It is what might be called an \"optimistic\"epistemol-ogy, since it allows that direct cognition of ultimates is possible for beings. A \"pessimistic\" epistemology (e.g., that of Kant or WIttgenstein) would maintain that although the mind is capable of forming useful approximate repre-sentations of reality, its cognitions never are unmediated by conceptions, and thus not \"pure.\"Indeed, a pure cognition would be regarded in such an epis-temology as impossible, for it is the nature of cognizers to have a point of view and to be limited by the fact of being an organism. Such an epistemology is clearly somewhat materialistic in orientation, whereas Buddhist epistemology assumes the mind's ultimate independence of particular bodies. For further discussion of the issues raised in this section of pv, see R. Jackson (1990). 4 . The opponent raises the understandable objection that if the mind's nature is the cognition of objects as they actually are, then we all should already be freed, since we all have minds.

The conditions that prevent the mind from fulfilling its natural function are the de-filements, the most basic of which is self-grasping.

If self-grasping is absent, there can be neither defilements nor stains, just as, once water has been boiled away, it cannot be heated any more, because there is nothing to heat. Or, to use another stock image from Indian philosophy, the mind that realizes no-self and has been transformed is like that that understands that a rope at first thought a snake is in fact only a rope: once the initial false cognition has been replaced by a true one, the false cog-nition no longer will arise, since truth can replace falsity, but falsity cannot re-place a truth that has become well established. It is, of course, the Buddhist view that truth in general and the realization of no-self in particular are such that they utterly uproot the falsehoods to which they are contrary. Just as Bud-dhist epistemology is \"optimistic\" regarding the nature of the mind, so the Buddhist theory of truth is \"optimistic\" in its conception of the soteriological value a realization of the truth may have. A more \"pessimistic\"view of truth might grant that even if there are fundamental truths the realization of which may greatly alter the way we approach the world, those realizations will not have the power utterly to eradicate all falsehoods, or perpetually to be present in one's mindstream. The disagreement between the optimistic and pessimis-tic views is derived in part from the differing kinds of evidence used to support each: pessimists rely on observations of \"ordinary'psychological states, while optimists rely on observations gleaned from meditative states that are not commonly accessible, but which are, nevertheless, regarded by the optimist as more normative (if not ordinary) than other, more accessible states. 6 If the mind were not perishable, i.e., impermanent, then its delusions would be everlasting. Since it is impermanent, it need not in principle always be de-luded, since the condition obtaining at one moment need not necessarily ob-tain at some future moment in which conditions have changed. It is, of course, conceivable that even though the mind is impermanent, every cognition will partake of delusion because delusion or self-grasping is intrinsic to the mind."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"418 Is Enlightenment Possible? ject that is not covered by stains, but the darkness of self-grasping that has come over the mind does not partake of the nature of [mind]. If it did so partake, then the manner of grasping that grasps a self would be in accord with how the mind actually exists. If that were the case, there would be no no-self, and a self would exist. 7 THE STAINS of attachment, etc., ARE ADVENTITIOUS, bet:ause they are [based upon] minds that partake of the inverse of the actual nature of mind.

The image of the mind as \"clear light\" ('ad gsal, prabhiisvara) goes back at least as far as A i, 10 (for nikaya references, see Collins [1982]246 and notes), and is, of course, cen-tral to the tradition of discussion of tathagatagarbha in Mahayana (see Ruegg [1969])-a tradition that seems to have originated primarily in circles that would be described as Yogacara. 7 Indeed, if self-grasping were intrinsic to the mind, then no-self would have to be false and the view that there is a self true, for it is the intrinsic nature of mind to cognize objects correctly, and the mind's intrinsic cognition in this case would be that there is a self. The effectiveness of this argument, obviOUSly, depends on the effectiveness of the assertion that it is the nature of mind to cognize correctly. 8 Once a mind has attained a state where its cognitions are invariably under the influence of the realization of no-self, i.e., when the realization of no-self is perfectly \"natural\"to the mind, there will be no room for self-grasping, for the mind will have attained its \"real\"nature, and cannot be diverted from that. rGyal tshab rje adds the observation that even before one has attained a direct realization of no-self, one can observe that even one's philosophical consid-eration of the topic helps to generate states of mind that cannot be damaged by self-grasping."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"The Truth of Path (1) 419 WHAT DAMAGES [ITS OPPOSITE], LIKE FIRE [WHICH WILL NOT BURN LONG] ON DAMP GROUND.

Whatever is separate from extra superimposition on the true, ultimate nature of dharmas.\"17 Accordingly, it also says in the Dasabhumika 15 There are, in fact, three types of opposing factors to a particular mental state, e.g., the wisdom realizing no-self: (1) Nescience, or the simple lack of know-ing what is known in that mental state. This is the function of ignorance ac-cording to the opponent. (2) Other opposing conditions, i.e., anything that is not the mental state in question, such as a chair or an orangutan. (3) A contra-dictory opposing condition, which is a mode of apprehension directly in op-position to the mode of apprehension involved in the mental state in question.

Since it apprehends a specific intentional object, ignorance is not just non-knowl-edge, nescience or an unclear cognition: it is the specific \"active\"apprehen-sion of phenomena in a manner opposite to wisdom's mode of apprehending phenomena. 20 Furthermore, if ignorance did not entail self-grasping, the Buddha would not have specified that it does when he set forth the twelve factors of dependent origination (see above, p. 70, n. 9). It is, after alL the self-grasping entailed by ignorance that permits the generation of karmic formations (saJ?lSkaras), which, in tum, ripen as the first cognition (vijiiiina) of a particular rebirth when the appropriate conditions are present. We already have seen that the indis-pensable cooperative condition of rebirth in sa.qlsara is craving, which is rooted in self-grasping."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"424 Is Enlightenment Possible?

Thus, they cite a passage from the Dasabhumika where ignorance and the self-view are said to be II concomitant factors\"(mtshungs ldan). The opponent takes this to mean that they are con-comitant factors in the most technical sense, i.e., that they are mental factors (sems byung, caitta) that are concomitant with a primary cognition in terms of basis, time, aspect, object and substance (see, e.g., Rabten [1980J 65); Since, however, a cognition only can be concomitant with one non-constant mental factor at a time, one cannot assert that both ignorance and the self-view are mental factors associated with the same primary cognition without contra-dicting the definition of concomitant factors. Thus, ignorance and the self-view must be different, with ignorance entailing the self-view, but not being the same as that view. 22 rGyal tshab rje replies that when the Dasabhilmika describes ignorance and the view of [self inJ the perishable as II concomitant,\"it does not mean that they are\" concomitant factors\"in the technical sense used in epistemology, but simply that they are the same. They are not absolutely identical, because ignorance is the broader category and self-view the narrower: every instance of the self-view is an instance of ignorance, but not every instance of igno-rance is an instance of the self-view, since there also is ignorance regarding such matters as permanence, pleasure, etc. Still, it is conventionally acceptable to describe ignorance as the self-view, because the self-view is the most basic and important type ofignorance. Similarly, one may speak of II a palasa forest/be-cause even though the area known as the \"forest\"will contain instances of trees other than palasas, pala5as predominate. 23 Candrakirti's discussion is found in the sixth chapter of his Madhya-makavatara.

(Since Dharrnakirti lived either contemporaneously with or, more likely, before SaTIkara, Vedanta does not seem to have been the important school during his time that it became later.) Now the Buddhist argument is turned against specific soteriologies. The Vai§e~ika view, as summarized by Buddhist critics, is that \"Through having practiced yoga for some time in accordance with the quintessential instructions of a guru, a yogi comes to know the self as a thing other than the senses and so forth, and thereby sees reality. He understands the nature of the six categories of existents, and he knows the self to be an all-pervasive entity that lacks activity. He does not accumulate either virtuous or non-virtuous actions or the predispositions they establish. Because he does not accumulate new actions but extinguishes old ones, the self separates from the body, senses, mind, pleasure, pain, desire, hatred and so forth, and does not assume a new body and senses. Thereby, the continuum of births is sev-ered like a fire which has consumed its fuel. When the self is alone (without any of its nine qualities---desire, hatred, effort, pleasure, pain, consciousness, virtue, non-virtue and activity), this is said to be the attainment of liberation\" (Sopa and Hopkins [1976] 57). See also Radhakrishnan and Moore (1957) chapter XI, Dasgupta (1975) I, Chapter VIII, Potter (1977) passim and Koller (1970) chapter 6. The Vai§e~ika takes disassociation of the self from what per-tains to it as the path to liberation; thus, they do not accept the Buddhist's con-tention that an object must be rejected if desire for it is to be rejected, holding as they do that the self need not be rejected, but that desire for it should be. 41 The Buddhist argues that the Vaise~ika's contemplation and rejection of the suffering of what pertains to the self springs from an insufficiently profound analysis of suffering, i.e., from a concern with the suffering of suffering rather than the suffering pervading the formations. The attempt to abandon suffer-ing merely by disposing of what pains one is bound to fail, because one has not thus abandoned the attachment, to the pleasures of the self, that is the primary force binding one in s~sara.

The basic criterion by which we instinctively judge whether something is worthy of our concern is its \"usefulness\"or \"uselessness\"to the self. Thus, hair and nails that have been cut off are no longer of concern to us, because they no longer can affect the self's happiness, whereas hair and nails still on our bodies can affect our sensations, and thus remain of concern to us. A possible Vai§e~ika response to many of the foregoing Buddhist objections might be to point out that the Buddhist is insightful in their psychological analysis, but that it still is possible for a yogin to overcome their instinctive identification of the self with what pertains to it, and thus to gain a \"higher\"realization of what is conducive to the ultimate happiness of the self, which is its separation from all that one once considered potentially beneficial to it. This would become psychologically compelling at the point where one recognized that the self (which is permanent and utterly blissful) is utterly different from those imperma-nent and suffering things to which one habitually has been attached.

Thus, the whole inheres in its parts; the jug in the clay; the pencil in the wood, etc. The basis for the unity of different categories must, like other categories, have a foundation in reality, as different from other kinds of things. Otherwise, it would appear as one of the other kinds of things, and not as separate. Therefore, the category of inher-ence is recognized as an independent kind of reality.\"\" Conjunction\" (ldan pa, Sa7'!lyoga), which has been discussed above (PV 89ff.) is that quality which is responsible for \"connecting\"two instances of the same category; i.e., two sub-stances when \"the pen is on the table\" or two qualities when sugar is\" sweet and white.\"Conjunction is impermanent, lasting only as long as the\" connec-tion\"of which it is an expression.

The list of types of inherence is supplied by rGyal tshab tje. 45 Since the two types of inherence that relate things other than the self to the self (numbers 1 and 5 above) only relate to the self such \"internal\" qualities as pleasure and pain and the sense-faculties, rGyal tshab tje argues that the Vai§esika eliminates from identification with the self such obvious items as exter-nal food, clothing, housing, etc. It might, however, be pointed out in the VaiSesika's defense that the self, as a substance, would be related to such other subst'ances as food and clothing not by inherence (which is inter-categorial) but by conjunction, which relates itemsintra-categorially, so the exclusion of food and clothing from the list of items related to the self by inherence does not imply that no relation is possible. 46 In any case, according to rGyal tshab tje, the Vai§e~ika's failure to account for all possible objects to which the word \"mine\"might be applied shows that what is considered \"related\"to the self, i.e., as pertaining to the self, is inade-quate as a basis for explaining attachment. One must, therefore, adopt the rather broader Buddhist explanation, which is that anything considered bene-ficial to the self, whether internal or external, is in fact what pertains to the self and is, thus, an object of the word, \"mine,\"hence an object of attachment.

The desirous mind and prakrti are both ascertained to be physical, and [puru~al to be conscious.3 1 For further discussion of the Sa~ya position, see Radhakrishnan and Moore (1957) 424-52; Dasugpta (1975) I, chapter VIII; Koller (1970) chapter 5, Larson and Bhattacharya (1987); and Sopa and Hopkins (1976) 58-62. 2 This is the passage cited by rGyal tshab rje above (section III:9:A) in his dis-cussion of the innate belief in a self independent of the aggregates, which is the object of refutation of a meditation on no-self. Here, the Sa~ya is ridi-culed for asserting as the basis of their soteriology a fact that not only is in-stinctively believed by all beings, but which, if accepted, actually is the basis of all suffering, not liberation. The Sa~ya argues that puru~a (the \"person,\" or self) is utterly different from praIq-ti (the \"procreatrix,\" or nature), which in-cludes the intellect (buddhl), the I-principle (aharrzkara), the sense-faculties, and the elements: in short, everything that we ordinarily list as comprising the cosmos. According to the Buddhist, it is precisely the belief that there is a per-manent \"person\" or \"self\"independent of the impermanent aggregates that is the ignorant view that leads to the self-grasping that insures our continued rebirth in samsara. That such a belief is instinctive is shown by two facts: (1) we instinctively desire to exchange\" defective\" aggregates for better ones, without fearing that thereby we would become a different \"person\" or have a different \"self\" and (2) we recognize that our pleasures and the sense-faculties through which they are enjoyed are transient, yet we continue to strive for perpetual, unchanging pleasure. That such belief is false is shown by the fact that no such self can be found to exist either within or independent ofthe ag-gregates, which are, in fact, exhaustive of the \"person\": in S~khya terms, the Buddhist conclusion is that there is only praIq-ti. 3 Prakrti itself is not a manifest phenomenon, but must be inferred from the various items that evolve from it, such as the faculties, elements, intellect, etc."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"The Truth of Path (2) 451 Thus, THAT ATTACHMENT TO SELF is the cause of resultant samsaric . suffering, because by its own power ATTACHMENT WILL BE NATURALLY drawn TO THE INTERNAL FACTORS, the visual and other faculties THAT INTEND form, etc., and because it is drawn by the power of self-grasp-ing itself. 4 The unacceptability, as a cause of detachment, of having a mind afflicted by the suffering of sUfferinl [298J (249c) RENUNCIATION LIKE THAT [ARISING] THROUGH SOME PRESENT SUFFERING IS AVERSION, BUT (250-251b) ITIS NOT DETACHMENT; AT THAT TIME THERE EXISTS ATTACHMENT, BECAUSE [CRAVING] ANOTHER OCCASION [FOR HAPPINESS], ONE SEEKS IT. THAT [AVERSION] REMAINS ONLY AS LONG AS [THE SUFFERING]; WHEN THAT IS ABSENT, ONE WILL REVERT To ONE'S OWN NATURE, BECAUSE AVERSION HAS SUFFERING AS ITS CAUSE. [OPPONENT:] One will be freed by meditating on suffering, be-cause we see that when one is afflicted by suffering and becomes renounced, having regretted [the suffering], one becomes renounced. Through knowing that the various items that comprise, or are evolutes of, praIq-ti are separate from puru~a, one will be able to infer that prak!1i itself is separate from puru~a. Further, pralqti is said to be inanimate, Le., ultimately physical, while puru~a is said to be conscious. The Buddhist, of course, divides the physical from the conscious differently, disposing of the \"person\" alto-gether, and finding that within \"nature,\" Le., the aggregates, form is physical, while sensation, recognition, formations and cognition are to one degree or an-other non-physical. The \"pure consciousness\" of the S~ya puru~a is most closely approximated by the aggregate of cognition, whose nature is the appre-hension of objects as they actually exist (d. above PV 206-208). 4 Thus, as long as one accepts the existence of a \"person,\" one will be attached to self and to what may benefit the self. Thus, one will continue instinctively to believe that what pertains to the self, Le., pra1qti, is necessary to the sel£ and one thus will continue to identify the two. From the Siir:llchya perspective, of course, as long as one continues to associate puru~a with pra1qti, one cannot be liberated, so the S~ya agrees with the Buddhist about the problems entailed by identifying the two.

It follows that this is so, BE-CAUSE, greatly attached to ANOTHER OCCASION for happiness, ONE SEEKS it.6 [OPPONENT:] When aversion arises continually, one will have de-stroyed [any possible] occasion for the arising of attachment, so one will be detached.

Our affliction by some type of suffering generates aversion to or renun-ciation of that suffering, but it is not detachment from it, because aversion ac-tually is an example of anger, which is a defilement, and because one in whom there is aversion continues to be attached to regaining the \"happiness\" they had enjoyed before the onset of their suffering. Q. above, PV 211c-212, for an analysis of why anger and attachment are opposing conditions without the absence of one entailing the absence of the other. 7 In GT,readgyis, rather thangyi. 8 A presumably hypothetical opponent argues that if aversion is generated con-tinually, then attachment never need arise again. Such an argument is absurd, however, for the suffering of suffering has been shown to arise occasionally.

[RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] He did not teach it with only the suffering of suffering in mind, because he taught the meditation on suffering for the sake of the renunciation of a [sa~saric] existence, WITH THE perva-sive SUFFERING OF THE FORMATIONS IN MIND. ALSO, THAT suffering [pervading] OUR formations is not based on a permanent self, because IT ARISES FROM its own causes and from defiled CONDITIONS.10 9 What is to be adopted and what rejected by worldly beings (objects of attach-ment and anger) is conceived in relation to a self. An arhant no longer believes in such a self, and thus is indifferent to what is ordinarily sought or avoided on its behalf. Thus their equanimity in the face of pleasure and pain-which they may continue to feel, but to which they are quite indifferent, since they do not (excuse the word-play) \"I\" -dentify with it. 10 As we have seen above (p. 351 ff.), suffering is identified with the five aggregates that are under the control of karma and the deffiements, and thus with the third type of suffering, that pervading all formations-not merely with the suffering of suffering or the suffering of change. The latter two types of suffering cover; respec-tively, what we usually call pain and pleasure, while the suffering of formations describes the suffering that pervades all smpsfuic existence.

ALSO, that mind that meditates on suffering like that is not asserted to be a path that directly frees one from [saI!lsaric] existence, because [freedom] HAS AS ITS BASIS or highest method the generation of THE VIEW that realizes NO-SELF. It also is necessarily the case that the medi-tation [on suffering] is not the path that directly frees one from [saI!lsaric] existence, because ONE IS directly FREED from [saI!lsaric] ex-istence BY accustomating THE VIEW that realizes VOIDNESS, and [because] THE REMAINING MEDITATIONS, realizing composites to be im-permanent and realizing contaminated phenomena to be suffering, ARE necessarily contemplated FOR THE PURPOSE OF effecting THAT wis-dom realizing no-self. THUS, the reason the Blessed One TAUGHT THAT FROM the realization of composites as IMPERMANENT originates the re-alization of contaminated phenomena as SUFFERING, and that FROM the realization of SUFFERING [originates] the realization of NO-SELF, is because-as just explained-he taught that the method and the result of the method exist thus. According to the siitra: \"0, monks, is form permanent or is it impermanent?\" ''It is impermanent, Lord.\" \"Is what is impermanent suffering or is it happiness?\" \"It is suffering, Lord, and what is impermanent has the nature of changing to suffering.\" \"Is it proper to say of that, 'This is mine,' 'This is I,' or 'This is myself?\" \"It is not, Lord.\"ll seen, based on a permanent self, because it arises through causes and condi-tions. 11 The passage is found at, e.g., M, i, 232. It is not furnished by Dharmakirti, but by his various commentators, who see it as a scriptural basis for ordering the three \"marks of existents\"according to Buddhism: all composites are imper-manent, all contaminated phenomena are suffering and all dharmas are with-out self. (A fourth, nirvar:a is peace, sometimes is added.) Only the direct realization of no-self can directly effect the peace of nirvar:a, but the realiza-tion of no-self can be assisted by the prior recognition of impermanence and suffering. The realization that all composites are impermanent leads to the re-alization that no saI!lsaric happiness can endure, and thus that there is suffer-ing. The suffering of contaminated phenomena, however, is seen to be under the power of various defilements and karma, and thus not to be a permanent self-for a self could not thus be under the power of causes and conditions. Thus, the aggregates that are identified with suffering are seen to be empty of self.

Formerly, from the combination of grasping at the happiness of self as obtainable and grasping at it as permanent, one grasped at the happiness as unalterably reliable. When one realizes that happiness is impermanent, the realization induces a suffering mind. Also, in the samadhi on the contamination of the upper realms, there arises the renounced mind that sees [birth in the upper realms] as like entering into a burning house-this definitely depends on the prior realization of subtle impermanence. When one sees that one is under the power of karma and defilements, one also understands that there is no independent person. The ordering of rough impermanence, suffering and no-self is thus comprehensibleY Summary [301J (254c-255b) ONE WHO HAS CRAVING, IS NOT FREE FROM ATTACHMENT, DEPENDS ON ALL EFFORTS, [AND] Is NOT FREE FROM THE DEFILEMENTS AND KARMA-SUCH A [BEING] IS CALLED \"SA¥SARIC.\" It follows that the self that is II freed\"HAS CRAVING, because IT IS NOT FREE FROM ATTACHMENT to self.

Gener-ally, it is sufficient to recognize that one's happiness is impermanent and that it therefore is suffering, and that the conditionality of suffering insures that that which suffers is without self. One cannot, of course, utterly renounce sarnsara until even the sublimest divine existence is understood to have a suf-fering nature, but the general recognition of one's impermanence and suffer-ing provides a sufficient basis for a preliminary appreciation of the fact of no-self. 13 The chain of reasoning is this: when a self is \"freed,\" a self still is conceived to"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"456 Is Enlightenment Possible?

One will, thus, continue to commit defiled actions based on craving, and thereby to circle in saI]1sara. In short, then, when the opponent asserts that a \"self\"is freed, they are, in fact, asserting an impossibility, for where a self is asserted there can be no freedom, and only where there is a recognition of no-self can there actually be freedom. This argument is reminiscent of that found in Candrakirti's Madhyamakiivatara, chapter vi. 14 Although the view opposed here is not clearly identified, it may be that of Vedanta, which maintains that only the self is real, and that what pertains to the self is ultimately non-existent or illusory. If that is asserted, however, then the self, too, must be non -existent, for the self is said to be the experiencer of what pertains to the self, and if what pertains to the self is non-existent, then so too must be the self, since the experiencer and the experienced must have the same ontological status, or their interaction cannot be explained. Further-more, a permanent self such as posited by all Atmavadins cannot possibly be both the creator of karma and the experiencer of karmic results, because such a self would have to change its nature from the time it was a \"creator\" to the time it was an \"experiencer,\"but only an impermanent entity can change its nature."},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"The Truth of Path (2) 457 COMPOSITES, WHICH BEGINNINGLESSLY ORIGINATES FROM THE SEEDS OF APPROPRIATE HOMOGENEOUS CAUSES.

Dharmakirti makes it clear here that delusion has no beginning, but has been with us eternally, perpetuated from moment to moment by appropriate ho-mogenes rooted in ignorance. Though beginningless, delusion is not endless: application of the appropriate antidote will result in a state in which wisdom is natural to the mind, homogeneously proceeding from moment to moment, in unending liberation. 16 The following section, concerned chiefly with refuting the idea that liberation can be attained through divinely empowered rituals recorded in scripture, seems to be aimed chiefly at the practices of the Nyaya school, rather than at the better-known ritualism of Mimar;-tsa, for the rituals criticized by Dharmakirti are empowered by lsvara-in which most Mimii.r;-tsakas did not believe-and involve the \"Unseen,\" a concept central to Nyaya cosmology.

Thus, one can sweat or scorch or starve oneself to the point of emaciation, shedding a great deal of physical weight, but one will not, thereby, lighten in the least the weight of the defilements that pollute the mindstream-for only mental changes will be able to lessen one's defilements."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Ii 460 Is Enlightenment Possible?

When intention is concomitant with craving, saI'flsaric rebirth will continue; when intention no longer is concomitant with craving, as in the mind of an arhant, rebirth need no longer occur. 21 Thus, when a Buddhist says that karma is a cause of continued sal11saric ex-istence, they actually are saying that an intention concomitant with both crav-ing and a distorted cognition of reality is a cause of continued sal11saric existence. The qualification that intention must be concomitant with craving and distorted cognition is important, because it is not intention as such that is saI'flsaric, since a buddha's cognitions invariably will be concomitant with intention.

The Buddhist reply is that if that is the case, then intention must have been neutralized as well, for craving and ignorance will invariably accompany intention in any mindstream that lacks a direct realization of no-self. Thus, intention's capacity to focus upon a particular object also will be neutralized as soon as the empowerment has been received-which clearly does not happen in those who have re-ceived empowerment. A possible opponent's reply to this alleged absurdity, not considered by Dharmakirti or rGyal tshab rje, is that the empowerment has the power not to destroy intention as such, but simply to disassociate in-tention from craving and ignorance. The Buddhist reply to this contention would, of course, be to point out again that a ritual that does not presuppose or entail a direct realization of no-self simply will not have the power to dis-associate intention from craving and ignorance. 25 The opponent shifts their tack slightly, arguing that an empowerment has the capacity to assure that at death-time there will be no more intention and thus no craving or rebirth.

In fact, there is no concomitance between empowerment and the presence or absence of mental faults; the concomitance is between the faults and different types of mental directionality: negative, ignorance-based direc-tionality leads to an increase in faults, while positive directionality, based upon wisdom, leads to a decrease in faults.

Furthermore, a permanent self cannot even be asserted to be an assistant cause in the generation of some re-sult, because an assistant cause must be such that its presence is correlated with the result's arising, and its absence with the result's non-arising, and a permanent self never can be absent.

The Buddhist, on the other hand, believes that both karma and the body are rooted in craving, and that as long as craving remains there will be karma and continued rebirth, while if craving is eliminated there will be no further basis for rebirth or the fruition of previously created karma. The Bud-dhist will be unable to accept that the Jaina path can eliminate craving, karma or the body, because craving is the basis of the other two, and craving only can be eliminated through a direct realization of no-self, a doctrine not held by the Jainas (who maintain that the soul's states are impermanent, but that its na-ture is permanent)."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"470 Is Enlightenment Possible?

Accordingly, by re-citing dharar:.i:s, etc., one is able to render some karmic obstacles suitable to arise [as a different] resultant ripening, but without aban-doning craving, no one has an antidote able to eliminate all karmas.43 Alternatively, the [third, fourth and fifth] lines [of verse 278-279b] show that if there is an abandonment without craving, then after that, one will be able to negate the ripening of even the smallest karmic po-tency; and the [last] line shows that without abandoning craving, one will be unable to render [karma] impotent to bring about the results of any previously created [karma]. [Some explain the third, fourth and fifth] lines [as saying that] one is able to abandon karma [whose re-sults] one need not definitely experience and [the last as saying] that one cannot abandon karma [whose results] one must definitely expe-result, and a bad one at that, the experience of which will entail the elimina-tion only of the seed of that specific experience. In other words, if one asserts that many karmas of differing strength and quality can be eliminated by a sin-gle austerity, then if austerity is not identical with pain, a mild austerity or even a pleasant experience that is a result of one of the karmas to be elimi-nated should suffice as an \"austerity.\"If austerity is identical with pain, then the Jaina faces the same problem as before: austerity only can eliminate the single karma of which it is a result. 43 The abandonment of craving through the realization of no-self can prevent the generation of further defilements and the experience of the results of de-filed karmas already created (since craving is the basis for either of these, and now is absent). It cannot \"repeal\"karma whose results already have been ex-perienced. Thus, an arhant whose body was crooked before their enlighten-ment will remain crooked afterwards, but they no longer create karma for future crooked bodies, nor need they experience the results of future-body karma created but unripened before their enlightenment, because their enlight-enment represents the utter destruction of the craving that is the indispensable condition for deilled karma's creation or fruition."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"474 Is Enlightenment Possible? rience. This explanation is not the meaning of the verse, and is ration-ally unacceptable, because it is said by many Mahayanists that a full confession with the four [opponent] powers prevents the ripening [even] of karma that one must definitely experience, and that it puri-fies one.44 [OPPONENT:] Well, then, this contradicts [the idea] that [there is karma whose result] definitely must be experienced. [RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] [Mahayanists] say that the meaning of IFdefi-nitely must be experienced\"is that [the karmic result will definitely be experienced] if one does not meet the antidote.45 Refuting [the idea} that kanna and craving are equally to be abandoned [319} (279c-280b) THE FAULTS ARE NOT FROM KARMA; ONE WILL EFFECT [KARMA THROUGH] HAVING THE FLAW [OF CRAVING], NOT FROM THE REVERSE [WHERE THERE IS NO CRAVING]; 44 The lines in question are PV 278c-279b: skye 'dod nyes pa beom pa'i phyir /gang yangskyon rnams 'gogbyed pal des skyed las la nus 'gyurgyilji Itarbyas pa nyams par 'gyur. An incorrect interpretation takes them to mean that the realization· of no-self will insure that weak karmas, the experience of whose results is un-certain, will be eliminated, but that those stronger karmas, whose results defi-nitely must be experienced, will not be eliminated. If this interpretation were correct, then enlightenment would be impossible, since there are in the mind-stream infinite karmas whose result\" definitely must be experienced.\"The cor-rect interpretation sees the entire verse as referring to all karmas, both weak and strong. The meaning then is that (a) if craving is eliminated, all karma (ex-cept that whose results already have been experienced) can be prevented from ripening and (b) if craving is not eliminated, no other karma can be prevented from ripening. Mahayanists hold that a full \"confession\"involving (1) recog-nition of the non-virtue committed, (2) regret for its commission, (3) a vow never to repeat the offense and (4) application of an antidote, has the power to prevent the experience of the results of the negative action, be it \"strong\" or \"weak.\" Antidotes vary, but the most potent-as we might expect-is consid-ered to be a meditation on no-self or voidness. 45 Thus, the designation of some karma as that whose results definitely must be experienced does not mean that there is karma whose results absolutely can-not be avoided-again, that would make enlightenment impossible. Karma whose results\" definitely must be experienced\" simply is karma sufficiently forceful that its fruition cannot be prevented unless mitigated or destroyed by the power of an antidote. A mitigating antidote is, e.g., a dharal)i, which can alter the manner in which a karmic result will be experienced. A destructive antidote is the direct realization of no-self, which uproots craving and thus eliminates the indispensable condition for the ripening of previously created karma."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"The Truth a/Path (2) 475 [IN THE LATTER CASE,] THERE WILL NOT BE ATTACHMENT EVEN FROM HAPPINESS, [SINCE] ONE IS WITHOUT DISTORTED IMPUTATIONS. [OPPONENT:] Since karma occurs when there is craving and crav-ing occurs when there is karma, each is equally to be abandoned. [RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] The FAULTS of attachment, etc., ARE NOT arisen FROM KARMA that is without craving, because ONE WILL EFFECT accumulation [of karma] through HAVING THE FLAW of craving; but one does NOT accumulate [karma] FROM THE REVERSE [type of action, where there is] no craving.46 [OPPONENT:] Since happiness originates from virtuous karma, [from happiness] will originate the craving to attain the [pleasurable] object again. [RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] It follows that for an arhant, THERE WILL NOT BE the arising of ATTACHMENT EVEN FROM HAPPINESS, because they ARE WITHOUT THE DISTORTED IMPUTATIONS of inappropriate mental judg-ments.47 Thus, we have identified and refuted the four principal factors op-posing the truth of path, which are analyzed as paths to freedom by others: (1) meditating on the sense-faculties and other things that pertain to the self as suffering, (2) cognizing prakrti and puru?a as separate, (3) [practicing] rituals in which one has been empowered and (4) eliminating karma and tormenting the body.48 46 There may be a correlation between craving and karma, but the concomitance is not invariable, for karma can still exist (although impotent) where there is no craving; nor are the two equally fundamental as causes of sa.qlsara, since craving is the invariable basis of the creation of negative karma, while negative karma is not necessarily the basis of craving-for residual negative karma will not generate craving in the mindstream of a person who has eliminated crav-ing. 47 An arhant cannot possibly be attached to the pleasure they experience, be-cause they are free from any notion of a self to whose pleasure they could be attached. Their pleasure is a genuine pleasure, unlike the spurious and tran-sient pleasures of ordinary beings, but their enjoyment of it is unsullied by grasping or desire, which, after all, are based on the belief in a self. 48 These correspond, of course, to the Vai§e~ika, Sa.qlkhya, Nyaya and Jaina sote-riologies. They do not correspond to the opposites of the four aspects of the truth of path, nor, for that matter, do the four aspects themselves seem to be explicitly discussed by Dharmakirti.

The aspect of de-finitive removal, for instance, seems to be covered by the refutation of the idea that the wisdom realizing no-self cannot utterly eliminate mental stains. The other two aspects are covered in passing. 49 However arguable the details of the various soteriologies refuted, the central fact that each of them is based on the belief in a permanent self that is the ba-sis of bondage and freedom is itself sufficient in Buddhist eyes to make them inconsistent, contradictory and, quite simply, false. Since false cognition can-not be the basis of the successful attainment that one expects, the liberation expected by those who believe in a self never will come to pass. The realization of no-self, on the other hand, is rational and true, and thus can be the basis of the attainment to which it points. Thus, Atmaviidin liberation is impossible, while Buddhist liberation is possible. 50 This presumably would include various Western systems, as well: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and any philosophical system that posits any sort of un-changing substance.

[RGYAL TSHAB RJE:] [The sugata] is preceded by THE TEACHER, which IS APPLICATION TOWARD complete KNOWLEDGE FOR THE SAKE OF OTHERS and which is the accustomation [of wisdom], because he pos-sesses excellence of realization. It follows that this [reason] pervades, because the path that is the cause of his applying himself thus is dem-onstrated in this case to be the teacher. If it is not for the sake of others, it is impossible that his knowledge be proven specia1.3 or knowledge. See Nagatomi (1957) 254. 2 Since in the forward system of explanation, the emphasis was on proving the Buddha's accomplishment, the three special characteristics of the sugata were described in terms of abandonments of various sorts of obstacles (cf. above, PV 139c ff.). In the reverse system, the emphasis is on the Buddha's knowl-edge, which is saving knowledge. Thus, from the fact that the four noble truths are true, we can infer that the Buddha must be a sugata who is cognitively spe-cial in three ways: (1) unlike non-Buddhist yogins, he knows the truth about samsara and nirvana, encoded in the four noble truths; (2) unlike Buddhist pra\"ctitioners who a\"re not yet rid of all mental faults or stains, he has knowl-edge that is utterly firm and coherent, and not in the least conducive to further rebirth; (3) unlike ordinary arhants, he has knowledge that is complete, for he knows all possible paths to liberation and all sal!lsaric dharmas that are to be rejected. Dharmakirti's characterization of the Buddha's knowledge as \"com-plete\" (rna Ius, a§e~a) comes close to an assertion of his omniscience, but it is not explicitly so; it may merely imply that the Buddha knows all that is neces-sary for salvation, not that he knows all phenomena. Similarly, while rGyal tshab rje sees the completeness of the Buddha's knowledge as surpassing that of \"Hlnayana sravakas and pratyekabuddhas,\"Dharmaklrti's meaning may not be so relentlessly Mahayanist: it may simply be that the Buddha, as the su-preme arhant, has knowledge more complete than that of other arhants-a view common in HInayana scholasticism. 3 If the Buddha is the sugata, with the knowledge needed by those intent on freedom, he also must be the teacher who, altruistically motivated, has discov-ered the truth and developed its salvific power to the utmost.

Without developing his wisdom to the utmost, he can-not possess the \"complete\"knowledge that is the third characteristic of a sugata. Without being a sugata, he cannot be a savior. Without being a savior, he cannot be an authority for those intent on freedom. Thus, it is necessary that he be motivated by altruism.

In rGyal tshab tje's reading, to accustomate completely the wisdom realizing no-self is to cognize the no-self of every possible object, which entails cognizing every object, which is, of course, omniscience.

We already have seen that it is meaning, not words, that is of primary importance in philosophical analYSis, and it thus is both possible and necessary to maintain that all Buddhist scrip-tures touch on the problem of authority. It is possible because the meanings embedded in, e.g., the sutras, can be shown to presuppose or entail under-standings of authority that only are made explicit in a few places. It is neces-sary because without presupposing or entailing a correct understanding of authority, the texts cannot be the basis for correct understanding by those who hear or read them, since all correct understanding is based on authorita-tive cognition.

It may, in fact, be the case that everything taught in Buddhist scripture is true, but a Buddhist will maintain that this is the case not simply because it is scriptural, but because it is reason-able. Such validity as scripture may have derives not from its being a special or separate source of knowledge, but from its conformity to what can be under-stood perceptually and through objectively impelled inference. Thus, scrip-tural testimony is not itself an independent authority, for it cannot be accepted unless it conforms to what already is established by perceptual and inferential authority. See Cabezon (1981). 9 The fact that a perceptual authority is unmistaken, or unsublated, establishes the fact that it fulfills the definition of authority discussed by Dharmaklrti above, PV 1; the fact that it is non-conceptual establishes that it cannot in-volve inference, and thus must be perceptual.

With this criterion in mind, the siitras can be shown to contain all recognized types of syllogisms. Thus, the statement that \"Any entity that has a self-nature such that it arises has a quality such that it will cease\" can be recast as a syllogism based on synonymy: '~y entity (subject) will cease (predicate), because it has a self-nature such that it arises (reason).\"The reason is relevant to the subject because any entity must have arisen; the reason is positively and negatively concomitant with the predicate because generation entails destruction and non-generation entails non-destruction.

When all defilements and their stains have been eliminated, of course, one is oneself a sugata, able and will-ing to be a savior of beings. Thus, this chapter should inspire the reader to strive to become an authoritative person. 13 rGyaltshab rje here rather imaginatively relates the Dharma-jewel to a more general theory of knowledge. Knowledge in Buddhist usage involves cutting off incorrect superimpositions on what really exists or really is the case. Thus, the Dharma-jewel, most often spoken of as the wisdom realizing no-self, can be described epistemically as any correct cognition that eliminates the seeds of further superimposition. Furthermore, any attempt to cut off superimposi-tion, even in present mundane matters, may be considered as a \"part\"(yan lag) of refuge, since it is a mental action that exists on the same continuum as such exalted instances of cutting-off-superimposition as the wisdom realizing no-self.
