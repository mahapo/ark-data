It purports to record events that took place during Gautama B uddha’s time (sixth to fifth century B.C.), but no text was apparent in India until after Nagarjuna (c. first century B.C. to first century a.d.) had revived the Mahayana traditions, discovering the Mahayana Sanskrit Scriptures, the Vimalakirti text am ong them. This text was subsequently translated into Chinese seven different times, starting in the third century, the version o f Kumarajiva (a.d. 406) being the most popular, and that o f Hsiian Tsang (a.d. 650) the most technically accurate. It was translated into Tibetan twice, the definitive version completed in the ninth century by the well-known translator Chos N id Tshul Khrims. It was also translated into Sogdian, Khotanese, and U ighur. Unfortunately all basic Sanskrit texts are now lost, except for some fragments found in Mahayana philosophical works. The Japanese chose Kumarajiva’s version for their translation, and the majority o f modern translations have been based on this text. Recently, Dr. E. Lamotte set forth to rectify this situation by basing his fine French translation on the Tibetan and the Hsiian Tsang versions. The history comes full circle finally, as the Rev. E.

Voidness itself is m atter.” 1 This statement, com m on in Maháyana Scriptures, expresses the quintessence o f the Middle W ay (mad- hyamapratipat). It is also fundamental to the message o f Vimalaldrti. It is utterly profound, yet so simple it is all too easy to overlook its astounding implications. “ M atter” represents the familiar world, the w orld o f relativity, whereas “ voidness” represents the goal o f spiritual longing, the ultimate, the transcen­dental, the infinite and eternal. If the tw o are just the same, w hat is the purpose o f religion? O f philosophy? O f the austerity o f spiritual practice? O f this statement or any statement or teaching? Is this not the most blatant form o f nihilism ?Indeed, a great many scholars, ancient as well as m odern, have mistaken the Middle W ay taught by Vimalaldrti, Nagarjuna, and the Mahayana Buddha as leading to the annihilation o f all values, m undane and spiritual, and the main purpose o f this introduction is to avert this disastrous mistake. The key lies in the concept o f “ voidness.” The w ord is carefully chosen, and does not mean “nothingness.” Thus, the equation o f “ m atter” w ith “ voidness” tells us some­thing about the condition o f matter, not that m atter does not exist at all. And the equation o f “ voidness” w ith “ m atter” emphasizes the fact that this teaching is, far from being nihilistic, the very cure for nihilism.Nagarjuna expounds the same theme in his Vigrahavyávartam: “ I salute the incomparable, perfect Buddha, w ho made the declaration o f the equivalence in meaning o f voidness, relativity, and the Middle W ay .” 2 Here we find, instead o f “ m atter,” the term “ relativity” (pratityasamutpáda), which is another key term o f the Middle W ay philosophy. It means that all finite things are interdependent, relative, and mutually conditioned, and implies that there is no possibility o f any independent, self-sufficient, permanent thing or entity. An entity exists only in relation to other entities. It must be composed o f parts, which came together when it was produced and which separate at the time o f its dissolution. All things that can be observed, imagined, or conceived by our finite minds are relative insofar as they are limited at least by having a point o f contact, hence a relationship,l"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"2 T h e H o l y T e a c h in g o f V im a la k ir tiw ith our perceptions or imaginations. H owever, as we make our way through the relative world, our minds are accustomed to constructing pairs o f opposites such as “ long and short” or “ light and dark.” Thus we hypothesize an opposite to every fmite, dependent, temporal, relative entity we can know or imagine, and we call it infinity, independence, eternity, absolute— that is, usually some etymologically negative term (in-finite = not finite, etc.). This is quite harmless and useful, until we begin to make the unconscious assumption that since most names seem to refer to entities, these must also, and we begin to think o f “ an independent being” and similar concepts. If we then attach these false notions o f ultimate being to whatever we are disposed to value, we fall short o f full awareness o f thoroughgoing relativity.So the teachers o f the Middle W ay use “ voidness” to remind us that all such false notions are delusive; that is, they use it to free us from our ow n concep­tualizations. Hence “ matter is voidness” does not negate matter as a relative phenom enon; it negates any false notion o f matter as an ultimate thing, as having any independent, substantial being, as having any ultimately true status. M atter in itself does not need to be felt to have some sort o f ultimate, independent substance, to stand in its diverse configurations and undergo its various relative trans­formations. In fact, were matter to have any sort o f independent, ultimate status (such as the true being we tend to attribute to all things because o f our habit o f confusing name w ith reality), it w ould become obstructed in its functional roles o f interdependency since, by definition, an independent “ thing” cannot be dependent. Therefore, all negative statements in the teachings o f the Middle Way, from the Scriptures to the systematic treatises o f the M adhyamika by the great masters such as N ig aiju n a and his successors, do not negate relative things per se but only their ultimate existence, which is initially attributed to them by habitual, delusive, mental constructions.Most people are so accustomed to such notions that the world m ight seem impossible if there were no enduring substance in things. In his major work, “ W isdom ” (Prajhd nama mulamadhyamakakdrikd),3 N ig aiju n a quotes a famous objector: “ If all this were void, then there w ould be no creation and no destruc­tion. ...” A nd N agarjuna’s answer comes as a shock at first: “ If all this were not void, then there w ould be no creation and no destruction.. . . ” 4 Thus voidness, far from annihilating everything, is the necessary condition for all relative existence. In other words, voidness here is not “ the void” we imagine in microspace or macrospace, a dark nothingness in which galaxies or atoms are contained; nor is it a substratum. It is infinity, which is only a term for the ultimate ineffability o f the relative reality to which we can see no ending or beginning.The difficulty o f correct understanding o f this principle may lie in its very"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"In tro d u c tio n 3simplicity. W hen minds are conditioned to discover truth in subtle complexities, it may become em otionally repugnant to accept a principle so simple that it seems to make intellect obsolete. This principle therefore will not lead to resolution in one’s deeper being, unless analytic intellect has succeeded in throw ing out every possible alternative. Hence it is as delusive to grasp the principle as a solution in itself as it is delusive to reject it out o f hand.The principle is that the fact that matter is voidness is absolutely affirmative o f matter, not negative o f matter. Indeed, o f all theories it is the only one that is thus affirmative.H ow is this so ?There are basically tw o kinds o f theory about ultimate reality: nihilism and “ absolutism.” O f course, intellectual history abounds in theories vastly different in detail, but all share one or the other o f these basic postulates about reality. They either deny it altogether or they posit some sort o f ultimate entity, substratum, or superstratum that serves as foundation, essence, container, or whatever, o f the immediate reality. And this absolutism, while appearing to affirm something ultimately, actually negates the immediate reality in favor o f the hypostatized ultimate reality. For if “ G od,” “ Brahm an,” the “ universe,” “ the void,” “nir­vana,” “ pure m ind,” “ the T ao,” “ pure being,” and so forth, make an ultimate reality beyond the imperfection o f our world, the spiritual man must naturally strive to escape this imperfection to reach his ultimate and eternal well-being. However widely the absolutes posited may differ, they all impel us in practice to negate our immediate reality.N o w we may better appreciate the first implication o f the statement that the immediate, relative reality is the ultimate, perfect reality: that m atter is voidness. If it is so, our immediate reality is ultimate, cannot be escaped or negated, and must be accepted as it is— at least to start with, before we try to do something about it in a relative w ay— w ith no false hope o f ever making it ultimate, since it already is so. W e are left w ith the seemingly contradictory tasks o f becoming conscious o f its ultimacy on the one hand and, on the other hand, o f devoting our energies to the im provem ent o f the unavoidable relative situation as best we can. For the successful accomplishment o f this dual task we need, respectively, wisdom (prajha) and great compassion (mahakarund), and these tw o functions are the essence o f the Great Vehicle (Mahayana), and o f the M iddle Way.W isdom does not allow us to settle for our habitual involvem ent w ith sensory objects (as just being “ given” “ out there”), and causes us to learn and practice probing beneath the surface o f apparent “ reality” to gain direct awareness o f the ultimate reality o f all things. At the same time, great compassion does not allow us to set up any hypostatized “ ultimate reality,” immerse ourselves in any"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"4 T h e H o l y T e a c h in g o f V im a la k ír tisort o f quietistic trance, or accept any sort o f illogical escapism from relativity, but imperatively compels us to act selflessly, as if already enlightened, even when we do not yet feel enlightened. Thus, the correct intellectual understanding o f the voidness o f m atter (rüpasünyatá), the voidness o f consciousness (vijhana- sünyata), or even the voidness o f voidness (sünyatasünyata) is the indispensable first step in the long meditational cultivation o f our tolerance o f incomprehensibility (anupalabdhidharmaksanti), as well as the supreme cure for self-defeating selfish­ness in daily action. And thus the way is difficult, not because o f any complexity, but because we cannot grasp matter, we cannot grasp mind, we cannot even grasp any doctrine o f the “ ungraspability o f m atter and m ind.” A nd still, matter, mind, and ultimate voidness remain before us in ineluctable relativity, like the reflection o f the m oon in water. It is clear that this subtle, profound, yet simple teaching can be inaccessible or even frightening to those either intellectually or emotionally unprepared, while the gem-like being properly prepared need only hear it, and all mental blocks are instantly shattered.5Thus, this teaching o f the Middle W ay is not for everyone. And hence the Buddha and the great masters w ho inherited his teachings devised other teachings intended to develop those w ho m ight be overwhelm ed by introduction through this teaching, to develop them to a point where they w ould be ready to confront the “ royal reason” equating voidness with relativity. There is the Hinayana teaching, which teaches a liberation (nirvana) that appears to be a release from the relative w orld short o f perfect enlightenment. There is the “ m ind-only” teaching (vijhánaváda), which teaches the reality o f pure mind, beyond all miser­able phenomena. Nevertheless, in all cases, these teachings serve in the develop­m ent o f an individual only up to a point: the point where he m ight meet with a Vimalakírti, w ho w ould bring hom e to him the ultimate message o f the Middle Way.In the words o f Nagarjuna, from the RatnavalT: “Just as the grammarians make one read the gram m ar, the Buddha teaches the D harm a according to the tolerance o f the disciples. He teaches the D harm a to some people to refrain from sins, to some to accomplish virtue, to some to depend on dualism, and to some to be independent from dualism; finally, to some, he teaches the profound, awe­inspiring practice o f enlightenment, whose essence is compassion and voidness.” 6In keeping w ith an alternative title o f the Scripture (“ Inconceivable Libera­tion” ),7 Vimalakírti lays great emphasis on the theme o f inconceivability, that is, the ultimate incomprehensibility o f all things, relative or absolute. He thus spells out the furthest implication o f the application o f voidness: that the finite, ego- centered m ind cannot even conceive o f the ultimate nature o f things and, hence, as far as such minds are concerned, their ultimate reality is itself inconceivability."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"In tro d u c tio n 5This accords with the degree o f attainm ent o f the bodhisattva, so frequently reached by VimalakTrti’s audiences, called “ the tolerance o f the ultimate birth- lessness o f all things” (anutpattika-dharmaksanti). It is extremely significant that the term “ tolerance” (ksanti) is used here, rather than “ conviction,” “ under­standing,” or “ realization” ; it emphasizes the fact that where the ultimate is concerned, the m ind is unable to grasp anything in the pattern o f dualistic know l­edge, for there is no finite object in this case and only relative objects can be grasped with relative certainty in the m undane sense. Yet that is not to say that the student’s task is to simply put a label o f “inconceivability” on all things and rest complacent w ith a sense o f having reached a high state. Indeed, there are three stages o f this tolerance: the verbal (<ghosdnugd), conforming (anulomikT), and true tolerance o f birthlessness. This indicates the difficulty o f attainment o f true tolerance, which occurs only at the eighth stage o f bodhisattvahood.* Incon­ceivability as a verbal concept is only a principle to be applied to the mind, just like the verbal concept o f voidness, or even o f infinity.W hen we reflect intensively on any o f these concepts, our minds open gradually in an ever widening sphere whose limits proceed from preconceived limitation to preconceived limitation. W e discover to our surprise that there is always something further, and we logically discard the possibility o f any limit being ultimate because any limit serves as the near boundary o f the next larger space or dimension or time. If we adhere rigorously to this process, we soon find ourselves lost in the stars, as it were, with less and less security about ever having started from anywhere. It takes time for such a process to permeate one’s whole being, for this can be a shattering experience to one whose conditioned notions are firmly ingrained and not previously brought into the light o f analytic exami­nation. The great master Atisa once likened the process to a m ound o f butter melting in a broth, or to an iron pressing sm ooth the wrinkles in a piece o f cotton cloth.The Buddha gave this type o f deepest teaching only to disciples able to deal w ith it. Nagarjuna himself rarely spelled it out explicitly, restricting himself to providing the means whereby the disciplined intellect can strip away its own conceptualizations and habitual notions. But VimalakTrti felt that such a message should be available to a much larger circle o f people, for he expressed himself definitively on all occasions, as recorded in this Scripture. Thus I have ventured to follow his example by spelling out the essence o f his message in order to insure that his speech w ould not be utilized falsely as a justification for nihilism or sophistry. O f course it need not be repeated that no formula, no phoneme, and no spelling out can do more than point the way to an understanding beyond words, which, however, includes words as relative things from another point"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"6 T h e H o l y T e a c h in g o f V im a la k ir tio f view. In fact, the very existence o f this introduction betrays m y inadequacy to live up to Vimalakirti himself, w ith his famous silence on the subject o f non­duality when questioned by Manjusri.The Method of VimalakirtiThe second chapter, “ Inconceivable Skill in Liberative Technique,” introduces Vimalakirti as a person w ho represents the consummate em bodim ent o f skill in liberative technique.9 This makes even more plain the'im plication o f the Scripture that he is an incarnation (nirmana), like Sakyamuni Buddha himself, and, as such, indistinguishable from the Buddha in the ability to do the right thing for each particular person. His eloquence is supreme, his behavior is exemplary, and his miraculous feats are in no way inferior to those o f the Buddha himself. A lthough he is respectful to the Buddha and usually polite with everyone, even the disciples, he is in no way intimidated in the august presence o f the Tathagata, as he proceeds to tell him to his face that he does not really exist.10The main technique Vimalakirti uses that is o f interest here— dichotom y— is found in his discourse, which relates to another alternative title o f the Scripture, “ Reconciliation o f Dichotomies” (yamakavyatyastdhdra).u This is in keeping with the traditional m ethod o f the Middle W ay masters, w ho had great skill in pitting polar opposites against each other to eliminate the fixedness o f each and to free the mind o f the student w ho applies himself to the polarities to open into a middle ground o f reality beyond concepts. The “ Great Sorcerers” (imahasiddhas) o f first-millennium India refined this technique to a consummate degree in their songs and extraordinary deeds, and the Great C h ’an and Zen Masters wielded the same “ double-edged sw ord” in their earthshaking statements and their illuminating activities. The singular quality o f such teachers’ use o f dichotomies lies in the fact that they relate them to the actual practice o f the hearers, forcing them to integrate them in their minds and actions. Thus, they expect them to be liberated inconceivably, while being totally engaged in the w ork o f helping other living beings.12 They recom m end their full cultivation of great love and great compassion while maintaining total awareness o f the total absence o f any such thing as a living being, a suffering being, a being in bondage. In short, they show the way to the full nonduality o f wisdom and great compas­sion, the latter being expressed as skill in liberative technique— the integrated approach acknowledged by all the masters as the essence o f the M ahayana.13This brings out Vimalakirti’s main bone o f contention w ith the disciples, such as Sariputra, w hom he finds to be too complacent in their sense o f liberation"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"In tro d u c tio n 7and superiority o f wisdom. It also further emphasizes the positive aspect o f the Middle W ay in general, which has all too often been overlooked by its Western critics, w ho have mistaken it for nihilism at w orst or at best for a sophistic, dry intellectualism. VimalakTrti makes it clear that the sole function o f wisdom, gnosis, or any state o f liberation is its function as a necessary com plem ent to the indispensable great compassion that has no object (anupalambha) and is not a sentimentally conceived em otion (ananunayadrstimahdkaruna). W isdom as a solitary possession, not integrated with liberative technique, is plainly declared to be bondage;14 even meditation, trance, concentration, and so on, are declared to be vain unless they aid in reconciliation o f the basic dichotom y o f world versus liberation, samsara versus nirvana. That some m odem scholars could think that this fundamental point o f VimalakTrti’s message, this fundamental procedural basis o f the entire Mahayana, m ight have been overlooked or neglected by such masters as Nagarjuna or CandrakTrti is indeed surprising.VimalakTrti’s reconciliation o f dichotomies is so thoroughgoing that he shocks the disciples by his advocacy o f the most horrible things as being part o f the bodhisattva’s path. The bodhisattva may com m it the five deadly sins,15 may follow the false heterodox teachings, may entertain the sixty-two false views, may consort w ith all the passions, and so on. Even the Maras, or devils, that plague the various universes are said to be bodhisattvas dwelling in inconceivable liberation16 — playing the devil, as it were, in order to develop living beings.This leads to an extraordinary fact that cannot be om itted, as startling as it may be to some because o f their historical convictions about the origins o f various Buddhist teachings. VimalakTrti’s method in integrating the intellectual and behavioral dichotomies is one o f many blatant hints o f Tantric ideas in the background o f his teaching method. Futher research is needed to determine w hether these connections prove the existence o f Tantrism at a time earlier than m odem scholars generally believe or w hether later Tantrics found VimalakTrti’s teachings a source o f inspiration. However, in a discussion o f VimalakTrti’s method, it must be noted that in the foregoing instances o f reconciliation o f extreme dichotomies VimalakTrti is actually teaching pure Tantric doctrine, as can be found in such works as the Guhyasamdjatantra.17 T he concept o f the adept using paths generally considered evil for the attainm ent o f enlightenment and the buddha-qualities is basic in Tantric doctrine and practice. Sakyam uni’s revelation o f the Saha w orld as a jeweled buddha-field accords w ith Tantric m ethod. T hat m ethod starts from the premise o f Buddhahood, in a sense, as the devotee cultivates his perception o f him self as a Buddha, o f all living beings as Buddhas and deities, o f the w orld as a pure realm o f Tathagatas, o f his ow n residence as a crystal sky-palace, and so fo rth .18 VimalakTrti’s discussion o f how a"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"bodhisattva in inconceivable liberation can transfer M ount Sumeru, or an entire universe, into a mustard seed is reminiscent o f the yogic practices for transmuting dimensions o f time and space found in the Guhyasamaja.19 The description o f Vimalakirti as versed in “ esoteric practices” ;20 the description o f the “ Family o f the Tathagatas” ;21 Vimalaklrti’s verse identifying wisdom as the m other and liberative technique as the father, exactly corresponding w ith the central Tantric symbolism o f male and female as vajra and bell, and the like;22 the yogic powers ascribed to the bodhisattva in inconceivable liberation, such as the ability to take fire in his stom ach;23 the mention o f the appearance o f many Tathagatas— including Aksobhya, Amitabha, Ratnavyuha, Sarvarthasiddha, and others— in the house o f Vimalakirti, teaching the esotericisms o f the Tathagatas (tathdgata- guhyaka) ;24 and the culmination o f the sutra in the vision o f the Buddha A ksobhya:25 All these lend the sutra a certain aura o f T antra.26 W hatever the “ historical” relationship may be, it is safe to say that Vimalaklrti’s m ethod o f the reconciliation o f dichotomies, as based on the inconceivable liberation o f the bodhisattva, forms a Tantra in its ow n right, that is, a rapid, effective m ethod o f simultaneously developing wisdom and great compassion to a high degree. Certainly, there is no doubt that the “ Great Sorcerers” (mahdsiddhas) o f later times w ould have felt at hom e in the house o f Vimalakirti.The Miracles of VimalakirtiVimalakirti claims inclusion am ong the “ Great Sorcerers” most o f all, perhaps, for his generous use o f miraculous feats in the course o f teaching his fellow men and wom en. In view o f the spirit o f m odern times, miracles merit some introduction in order to clear the air o f prejudice so they may serve their proper function. Actually, modern scholars and the traditional scholars o f Tibet, China, and Japan agree, albeit unwittingly, on a fundamental point: M odern scholars do not normally believe in “supernatural” miracles, but neither do they believe the events in the life o f Vimalakirti to be historical. They see the Scripture as a literary creation by an imaginative artist o f the Mahayana trad itio n : an allegorical presentation o f certain basic philosophical and religious teachings, set in the ancient and hallowed times o f the Buddha Sakyamuni and using fictitious Tathagatas and bodhisattvas to dramatize the doctrines. Tradi­tional scholars do believe in the historicity o f Vimalakirti, the other bodhisattvas, and the Buddha in his Mahayana manifestations, as well as in the “science- fictional” w orld view o f interrelated universes or buddha-fields. Nevertheless, because o f their technical evaluation o f the compassionate motives and miraculous8 T h e H o l y T e a c h in g o f V im a la k ir ti"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"In tro d u c tio n gpowers of these Buddhas and bodhisattvas, they agree about the allegorical natureo f the Scripture. T hat is, they believe Vimalakírti to be an emanated incarnation (inirmdnakaya) o f the Buddha, a living allegory, and a vehicle o f the highest teaching; they believe that everything he does and says is solely for the purpose o f developing and liberating living beings. Therefore, there is general agreement on the point that the events in the Scripture are allegorical, and we shall leave aside the question o f whether they are living or literary allegory.This attitude should be maintained to reap the full benefit o f the miracles portrayed in the Scripture. M odem and traditional scholars agree that the miracles are not simply displays o f magical prowess, either clamoring for belief or challenging disbelief, but rather are intended to stretch the imagination, w hether by Vimalakírti himself,\"as an artist o f life-forms, in their magical accomplishment or by the master literary artist in their creation; they are intended to shake the student’s ingrained preconceptions o f possibility and impossibility and make him receptive to the message o f inconceivability. Certainly the H w a Yen masters w ould agree, pointing out the cosmic vision in the jeweled parasol (p. 12), the thrones im ported from the universe M erudhvaja (p. 51), the inexhaustible food (p. 81), the miniaturization and display o f the universe Abhirati (p. 94), etc., as perfect illustrations o f the principle o f mutual nonobstruction o f phenom ena (shih shih w u ai; Thus Vimalakírti clearly demonstrates the effectivecom plem entarity o f the supposed “ positive approach” o f the Avatamsaka and the “negative approach” o f the Prajhaparamita, showing the ultimate miracle to be the utter equivalence o f voidness and the dazzling relativity o f inter­penetrating universes.As we hear V imalaklrti’s exhortation to strive for tolerance o f inconceivability and the inconceivable liberation and as our rigid boundaries for exclusion o f possibilities soften and give way before ever expanding frames o f reference, our contemplation o f the message o f Vimalakírti through opening our mental horizons on the ever widening scope o f infinitude will enhance our enjoym ent and appreciation o f the beauty and splendor o f the miraculous displays effected by the Buddha and by Vimalakírti. Similarly, our imaginative visualization o f the mental pictures created by the descriptions o f the buddha-fields and by the distortions o f dimensions, distances, times, and spaces will contribute to our sensitivity to the profound and subtle implications o f Vimalaklrti’s eloquent teaching, that we may be so fortunate to come to hear the great lion’s roar o f his profound silence."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"IPurification o f the Buddha-Field1Reverence to all Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Aryasravakas, and Pratyekabuddhas, in the past, the present, and the future.Thus have I heard at one time.

I see the splendid expanse o f the buddha-field o f the Lord Sakyamuni as equal to the splendor of, for example, the abodes o f the highest deities.” 54Then the venerable Sariputra said to the Brahma Sikhin, “ As for me, O Brahma, I see this great earth, w ith its highs and lows, its thorns, its precipices, its peaks, and its abysses, as if it were entirely filled w ith ordure.”Brahm a Sikhin replied, “ The fact that you see such a buddha-field as this as if it were so im pure, reverend Sariputra, is a sure sign that there are highs and lows in your mind and that your positive thought in regard to the buddha-gnosis is not pure either.

It is selfless, because it is free o f the dust o f desire. It is lifeless, because it is free o f birth and death. It is w ithout personalities, because it dispenses with past origins and future destinies.“ ‘The Dharm a is peace and pacification, because it is free from desire. It does not become an object, because it is free o f words and letters; it is inexpressible, and it transcends all m ovem ent o f m ind.7“ ‘The D harm a is omnipresent, because it is like infinite space.

You should beg your food in awareness o f the ultimate nonexistence o f food. You should seek alms for the sake o f eliminating the materialism14 o f others. W hen you enter a town, you should keep in mind its actual voidness, yet you should proceed through it in order to develop men and women. You should enter homes as if entering the family o f the B uddha.15 You should accept alms by not taking anything. You should see form like a man blind from birth, hear sounds as if they were echoes, smell scents as if they were winds, experience tastes w ithout any discrimination, touch tangibles in awareness o f the ultimate lack o f contact in gnosis, and know things with the consciousness o f an illusory creature.

Thus, when you eat, after offering, you should be neither affected by passions nor free o f passions, neither involved in concentration nor free from concentration, neither living in the world nor abiding in liberation.

As soon as their ow n spirits o f enlighten­ment had become clear to them, they bow ed at the feet o f that good man and pressed their palms together in reverence.

W hy? Lord, I rem em ber one day when, after the Lord had given some brief instruction to the monks, I was defining the expressions o f that discourse by teaching the meaning o f impermanence, suffering, selflessness, and peace;31 the Licchavi Vimalakirti came there and said to me, ‘Reverend Mahakatyayana, do not teach an ultimate reality endowed with activity, production, and destruction! Reverend Mahakatyayana, nothing was ever destroyed, is destroyed, or will ever be destroyed. Such is the meaning o f “ impermanence.” The meaning o f the realization o f birthlessness, through the realization o f the voidness o f the five aggregates, is the meaning o f “ suffering.” 32 The fact o f the nonduality o f self and selflessness is the meaning o f “ selflessness.” That which has no intrinsic substance and no other sort o f substance does not bum , and what does not burn is not extinguished ;33 such lack o f extinction is the meaning o f “ peace.” ’“ W hen he had discoursed thus, the minds o f the monks were liberated from their defilements and entered a state o f nongrasping.

Reverend Upali, all things are w ithout production, destruction, and duration, like magical illusions, clouds, and lightning; all things are evanescent, not remaining even for an instant; all things are like dreams, hallucinations, and unreal visions; all things are like the reflection o f the m oon in water and like a m irror-im age; they are born o f mental construction.

Reverend Rahula, renunciation is not material but is free o f matter. It is free o f the extreme views o f beginning and end.44 It is the path o f liberation. It is praised by the wise, embraced by the saints, and causes the defeat o f all Maras. It liberates from the five states o f existence, purifies the five eyes, cultivates the five powers, and supports the five spiritual faculties. Renunciation is totally harmless to others and is not adulterated w ith evil things. It disciplines the heterodox, transcending all denominations. It is the bridge over the swamp o f desire, w ithout grasping, and free o f the habits o f “ I” and “ mine.” It is w ithout attachment and w ithout disturbance, eliminating all com m otion. It disciplines one’s ow n mind and protects the minds o f others. It favors mental quiescence and stimulates tran­scendental analysis. It is irreproachable in all respects and so is called renunciation. Those w ho leave the m undane in this way are called “ truly renunciant.” Young men, renounce the w orld in the light o f this clear teaching! The appearance o f the Buddha is extremely rare. H um an life endowed w ith leisure and opportunity is very hard to obtain. T o be a human being is very precious.’45“ The young men complained: ‘But, householder, we have heard the Tathagata declare that one should not renounce the w orld w ithout the permission o f one’s parents.’“ Vimalakirti answered: ‘Y oung men, you should cultivate yourselves intensively to conceive the spirit o f unexcelled, perfect enlightenment. That in itself will be your renunciation and high ordination!’46“Thereupon, th irty-tw o47 o f the Licchavi youths conceived the spirit o f unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.

W hy? Lord, I remember one day w hen the body o f the Lord manifested some indisposition and he required some milk; I took the bowl and went to the door o f the mansion o f a great Brahm an family.49 The Licchavi Vimalakirti came there, and, having saluted me, said, ‘Reverend Ananda, what are you doing on the threshold o f this house w ith your bow l in your hand so early in the m orning ?’“ I replied: ‘The body o f the Lord manifests some indisposition, and he needs some milk.

H ow could disease or discomfort affect such a body?“ ‘Reverend Ánanda, go in silence, and do not belittle the Lord. D o not say such things to others. It w ould not be good for the powerful gods or for the bodhisattvas coming from the various buddha-fields to hear such words.“ ‘Reverend Ánanda, a universal monarch, w ho is endow ed only with a small root o f virtue, is free o f diseases. H ow then could the Lord, w ho has an infinite root o f virtue, have any disease? It is impossible.“ ‘R everend Ánanda, do not bring shame upon us, but go in silence, lest the heterodox sectarians50 should hear your words. They w ould say, “ For shame! The teacher o f these people cannot even cure his ow n sicknesses. H ow then can he cure the sicknesses o f others?” R everend Ánanda, go then discreetly so that no one observes you.“ ‘R everend Ánanda, the Tathagatas have the body o f the D harm a— not a body that is sustained by material food. The Tathagatas have a transcendental body that has transcended all mundane qualities. There is no injury to the body o f a Tathagata, as it is rid o f all defilements. T he body o f a Tathagata is uncom ­pounded and free o f all formative activity. Reverend Ánanda, to believe there can be illness in such a body is irrational and unseemly!’“ W hen I had heard these words, I wondered if I had previously misheard and misunderstood the Buddha, and I was very much ashamed. Then I heard a voice from the sky: ‘Ánanda! The householder speaks to you truly. Nevertheless, since the Buddha has appeared during the time o f the five corruptions, he disciplines living beings by acting lowly and humble. Therefore, Ánanda, do not be ashamed, and go and get the m ilk!’51“ Lord, such was my conversation52 w ith the Licchavi Vimalakírti, and therefore I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness.”In the same way, the rest o f the five hundred disciples were reluctant to go to the Licchavi Vimalakírti, and each told the Buddha his ow n adventure, recounting all his conversations with the Licchavi Vimalakírti."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"4The Reluctance o f the BodhisattvasThen, the Buddha said to the bodhisattva M aitreya,1 “ Maitreya, go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness.”Maitreya replied, “ Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness. W hy? Lord, I rem em ber that one day I was engaged in a conversation w ith the gods o f the Tusita heaven,2 the god Samtusita and his retinue, about the stage o f nonregression o f the great bodhisattvas. At that time, the Licchavi Vimalakirti came there and addressed me as follows:“ ‘Maitreya, the Buddha has prophesied that only one more birth stands between you and unexcelled, perfect enlightenment. W hat kind o f birth does this prophecy concern, Maitreya? Is it past? Is it future? O r is it present? If it is a past birth, it is already finished. If it is a future birth, it will never arrive. If it is a present birth, it does not abide. For the Buddha has declared, “ Bhiksus, in a single m om ent, you are born, you age, you die, you transmigrate, and you are reborn.”“ ‘Then m ight the prophecy concern birthlessness? But birthlessness applies to the stage o f destiny for the ultimate,3 in which there is neither prophecy nor attainment o f perfect enlightenment.‘“ Therefore, Maitreya, is your reality from birth? O r is it from cessation? Your reality as prophesied is not born and does not cease, nor will it be born nor will it cease.4 Furtherm ore, your reality is just the same as the reality o f all living beings, the reality o f all things, and the reality o f all the holy ones. If your enlightenment can be prophesied in such a way, so can that o f all living beings. W hy? Because reality does not consist o f duality or o f diversity. Maitreya, whenever you attain Buddhahood, which is the perfection o f enlightenment, at the same time all living beings will also attain Buddhahood. W h y ? Enlightenment consists o f the realizations o f all living beings. Maitreya, at the m om ent when you attain ultimate liberation, all living beings will also attain ultimate liberation. W hy ? The Tathagatas do not enter ultimate liberation until all living beings have entered ultimate liberation. For, since all living beings are utterly liberated, the Tathagatas see them as having the nature o f ultimate liberation.34"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"T h e R e lu c ta n c e o f the B o d h is a ttv a s 3 5“ ‘Therefore, Maitreya, do not fool and delude these deities!

Enlightenment is the eradication o f all marks. Enlightenment is free o f presump­tions concerning all objects. Enlightenment is free o f the functioning o f all intentional thoughts. Enlightenment is the annihilation o f all convictions. Enlightenment is free from all discriminative constructions. Enlightenment is free from all vacillation, mentation, and agitation. Enlightenment is not involved in any commitments. Enlightenment is the arrival at detachment, through freedom from all habitual attitudes. The ground o f enlightenment is the ultimate realm.6 Enlightenment is realization o f reality. Enlightenment abides at the limit o f reality.7 Enlightenment is w ithout duality, since therein are no minds and no things. Enlightenment is equality, since it is equal to infinite space.“ ‘Enlightenment is unconstructed, because it is neither born nor destroyed, neither abides nor undergoes any transformation. Enlightenm ent is the complete knowledge o f the thoughts, deeds, and inclinations o f all living beings. Enlighten­ment is not a door for the six media o f sense.8 Enlightenment is unadulterated, since it is free o f the passions o f the instinctually driven succession o f lives. Enlightenment is neither somewhere nor nowhere, abiding in no location or dimension. Enlightenment, not being contained in anything, does not stand in reality. Enlightenment is merely a name and even that nam e is unm oving. Enlightenment, free o f abstention and undertaking, is energyless. There is no agitation in enlightenment, as it is utterly pure by nature. Enlightenment is radiance, pure in essence. Enlightenment is w ithout subjectivity and completely w ithout object. Enlightenment, which penetrates the equality o f all things, is undifferentiated. Enlightenment, which is not shown by any example, is incomparable. Enlightenment is subtle, since it is extremely difficult to realize. Enlightenment is all-pervasive, as it has the nature o f infinite space. Enlighten­ment cannot be realized, either physically or mentally. W hy? The body is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and hallucinations.

W hy? The body is the issue o f the four main elements, and in these elements there is no ow ner and no agent. There is no self in this body, and, except for arbitrary insistence on self, ultimately no “ I” which can be said to be sick can be apprehended. Therefore, thinking ‘ “ I” should not adhere to any self, and “ I” should rest in the knowledge o f the root o f illness,’ he should abandon the conception o f himself as a personality and produce the conception o f himself as a thing, thinking ‘This body is an aggregate o f many things; when it is bom , only things are b o m ; when it ceases, only things cease; these things have no awareness or feeling o f each other; w hen they are born, they do not think, “I am born .” W hen they cease, they do not think, “ I cease.” ’“ Furthermore, he should understand thoroughly the conception o f himself as a thing by cultivating the following consideration: ‘Just as in the case o f the conception o f “self,” so the conception o f “ thing” is also a misunderstanding, and this misunderstanding is also a grave sickness; I should free myself from this sickness and should strive to abandon it.’13“ W hat is the elimination o f this sickness? It is the elimination o f egoism and possessiveness. W hat is the elimination o f egoism and possessiveness? It is the freedom from dualism. W hat is freedom from dualism ? It is the absence o f in­volvement with either the external or the internal. W hat is absence o f involve­ment with either external or internal? It is nondeviation, nonfluctuation, and nondistraction from equanimity. W hat is equanimity ? It is the equality o f every­thing from self to liberation. W hy? Because both self and liberation are void. H ow can both be void? As verbal designations, they both are void, and neither is established in reality. Therefore, one w ho sees such equality makes no difference between sickness and voidness; his sickness is itself voidness, and that sickness as voidness is itself void.14“ The sick bodhisattva should recognize that sensation is ultimately nonsensa­tion, but he should not realize the cessation o f sensation. A lthough both pleasure and pain are abandoned w hen the buddha-qualities are fully accomplished, there is then no sacrifice o f the great compassion for all living beings living in the bad migrations. Thus, recognizing in his ow n suffering the infinite sufferings o f these living beings,15 the bodhisattva correctly contemplates these living beings and resolves to cure all sicknesses. As for these living beings, there is nothing to be applied, and there is nothing to be rem oved; one has only to teach them the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"4 6 T h e H o l y T e a c h in g o f V im a la k ir tiD harm a for them to realize the basis from which sicknesses arise. W hat is this basis? It is object-perception.16 Insofar as apparent objects are perceived, they are the basis o f sickness. W hat things are perceived as objects? The three realms o f existence are perceived as objects. W hat is the thorough understanding o f the basic, apparent object? It is its nonperception, as no objects exist ultimately. W hat is nonperception? The internal subject and the external object are not perceived dualistically. Therefore, it is called nonperception.17“ Manjusri, thus should a sick bodhisattva control his ow n mind in order to overcome old age, sickness, death, and birth. Such, Manjusri, is the sickness o f the bodhisattva. If he takes it otherwise, all his efforts will be in vain. For example, one is called ‘hero’ when one overcomes all enemies. Just so, one is called ‘bodhi­sattva’ w hen one conquers the miseries o f aging, sickness, and death.18“ The sick bodhisattva should tell himself: ‘Just as m y sickness is unreal and nonexistent, so the sicknesses o f all living beings are unreal and nonexistent.’ T hrough such considerations, he arouses the great compassion tow ard all living beings w ithout falling into any sentimental compassion.19 The great compassion that strives to eliminate the accidental passions does not conceive o f any life in living beings. W hy? Because great compassion that falls into sentimentally purposive views only exhausts the bodhisattva in his reincarnations. But the great compassion which is free o f involvement with sentimentally purposive views does not exhaust the bodhisattva in all his reincarnations.20 He does not reincarnate through involvement with such views but reincarnates with his mind free o f involvement. Hence, even his reincarnation is like a liberation. Being reincarnated as if being liberated, he has the power and ability to teach the Dharma which liberates living beings from their bondage. As the Lord declares: ‘It is not possible for one w ho is himself bound to deliver others from their bondage. But one who is himself liberated is able to liberate others from their bondage.’ Therefore, the bodhisattva should participate in liberation and should not partic­ipate in bondage.“ W hat is bondage? And w hat is liberation? To indulge in liberation from the world w ithout em ploying liberative technique is bondage for the bodhisattva. T o engage in life in the w orld w ith full em ploym ent o f liberative technique is liberation for the bodhisattva. T o experience the taste o f contemplation, medita­tion, and concentration w ithout skill in liberative technique is bondage.

The bondage o f liberative technique not integrated with wisdom consists o f the bodhisattva’s planting o f the roots o f virtue w ithout dedicating them for the sake o f enlightenment, while living in the grip o f dogmatic convictions, passions, attachments, resentments, and their subconscious instincts.23“ W hat is the liberation o f liberative technique integrated w ith wisdom? The liberation o f liberative technique integrated w ith wisdom consists o f the bod­hisattva’s dedication o f his roots o f virtue for the sake o f enlightenment, w ithout taking any pride therein, while forgoing all convictions, passions, attachments, resentments, and their subconscious instincts.24“ Manjusri, thus should the sick bodhisattva consider things. His wisdom is the consideration o f body, mind, and sickness as im perm anent, miserable, empty, and selfless. His liberative technique consists o f not exhausting him self by trying to avoid all physical sickness, and o f applying himself to accomplish the benefit o f living beings, w ithout interrupting the cycle o f reincarnations. Furtherm ore, his wisdom lies in understanding that body, mind, and sickness are neither new nor old, both simultaneously and sequentially. And his liberative technique lies in not seeking cessation o f body, mind, or sicknesses.“ That, Manjusri, is the way a sick bodhisattva should concentrate his m ind; he should live neither in control o f his mind, nor in indulgence o f his mind. W hy? To live by indulging the mind is proper for fools and to live in control o f the mind is proper for the disciples. Therefore, the bodhisattva should live neither in control nor in indulgence o f his mind.

These thrones were so tall, spacious, and beautiful that the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Sakras, Brahmas, Lokapalas, and other gods had never before seen the like. The thrones descended from the sky and came to rest in the house o f the Licchavi Vimalaklrti.

But the beginner bodhisattvas were not able to transform themselves to sit upon the thrones. Then, the Licchavi VimalakTrti taught these beginner bodhisattvas a teaching that enabled them to attain the five superknowledges, and, having attained them, they transformed their bodies to a height o f forty-tw o hundred thousand leagues and sat upon the thrones. But still the great disciples were not able to seat themselves upon the thrones.The Licchavi VimalakTrti said to the venerable Sariputra, “ Reverend Sariputra, take your seat upon a throne.”He replied, “ Good sir, the thrones are too big and too high, and I cannot sit upon them .”VimalakTrti said, “ Reverend Sariputra, bow dow n to the Tathagata M erupra- dlparaja, and you will be able to take your seat.”Then, the great disciples bow ed dow n to the Tathagata Merupradiparaja and they were seated upon the thrones.Then, the venerable Sariputra said to the Licchavi VimalakTrti, “ Noble sir, it is astonishing that these thousands o f thrones, so big and so high, should fit into such a small house and that the great city o f VaisalT, the villages, cities, kingdoms, capitals o f JambudvTpa, the other three continents, the abodes o f the gods, the nagas, the yaksas, the gandharvas, the asuras, the garudas, the kimnaras, and the mahoragas— that all o f these should appear w ithout any obstacle, just as they were before!”T he Licchavi VimalakTrti replied, “ Reverend Sariputra, for the Tathagatas and the bodhisattvas, there is a liberation called ‘Inconceivable.’10 The bodhisattva w ho lives in the inconceivable liberation can put the king o f mountains, Sumeru, which is so high, so great, so noble, and so vast, into a mustard seed.

The bodhisattva w ho lives in the inconceivable liberation, for the sake o f disciplining those living beings w ho are disciplined through immeasurable periods o f evolution, can make the passing o f a week seem like the passing o f an aeon, and he can make the passing o f an aeon seem like the passing o f a week for those w ho are disciplined through a short period o f evolution. The living beings w ho are disciplined through an immeasurable period o f evolution actually perceive a week to be the passing o f an aeon, and those disciplined by a short period o f evolution actually perceive an aeon to be the passing o f a w eek.13“ Thus, a bodhisattva w ho lives in the inconceivable liberation can manifest all the splendors o f the virtues o f all the buddha-fields within a single buddha-field.

Thus, the disciples can never appreciate those qualities.8“ Therefore, Manjusri, the ordinary individual is grateful to the Tathagata, but the disciples are not grateful. W h y ?

Having seen the nature o f life, one neither belongs to it nor is one utterly liberated from it. Such understanding is the entrance into nonduality.”The bodhisattva Pratyaksadarsana declared, “ ‘Destructible’ and ‘indestructible’ are dualistic. W hat is destroyed is ultimately destroyed. W hat is ultimately destroyed does not become destroyed; hence, it is called ‘indestructible.’ W hat is indestructible is instantaneous, and w hat is instantaneous is indestructible. The experience o f such is called ‘the entrance into the principle o f nonduality.’” 8 The bodhisattva Parigüdha declared, “ ‘Self’ and ‘selflessness’ are dualistic.

Likewise, it is dualistic to dedicate morality, tolerance, effort, meditation, and wisdom for the sake o f omniscience. Omniscience is the nature o f wisdom, and total dedication is the nature o f omniscience. Thus, the entrance into this principle o f uniqueness is the entrance into nonduality.”The bodhisattva Gambhlramati declared, “ It is dualistic to say that voidness is one thing, signlessness another, and wishlessness still another. W hat is void has no sign. W hat has no sign has no wish. W here there is no wish there is no process o f thought, mind, or consciousness.

The intrinsic nature o f all such actions is voidness, wherein ultimately there is neither merit, nor sin, nor neutrality, nor action itself. The nonaccom plishm ent o f such actions is the entrance into non­duality.”The bodhisattva Padm avyuha declared, “ Dualism is produced from obsession with self, but true understanding o f self does not result in dualism. W ho thus abides in nonduality is w ithout ideation, and that absence o f ideation is the entrance into nonduality.”The bodhisattva Srigarbha declared, “ Duality is constituted by perceptual manifestation. N onduality is objectlessness.

W h y so ? Because, prince o f gods, the enlightenment o f the Buddhas arises from the Dharm a, and one honors them by the D harm a worship,5 and not by material worship. Thus it is taught, prince o f gods, and thus you must understand it.”The Buddha then further said to Sakra, the prince o f gods, “ Once, prince o f gods, long ago, long before aeons m ore num erous than the innumerable, im ­mense, immeasurable, inconceivable, and even before then, the Tathagata called Bhaisajyaraja6 appeared in the w orld: a saint, perfectly and fully enlightened, endowed w ith knowledge and conduct, a blissful one, know er o f the world, incomparable know er o f men w ho need to be civilized, teacher o f gods and men, a Lord, a Buddha.7 He appeared in the aeon called Vicarana in the universe called Mahavyuha.“ The length o f life o f this Tathagata Bhaisajyaraja, perfectly and fully en­lightened one, was tw enty short aeons.

Then, prince o f gods, the prince Candracchattra, out o f his great faith in the Tathagata, left the house­hold life in order to enter the homeless life o f a m onk and, having done so, lived making great efforts tow ard the attainment o f virtue. Having made great effort and being well established in virtue, he soon produced the five superknowledges, understood the incantations, and obtained the invincible eloquence. W hen the Tathagata Bhaisajyaraja attained ultimate liberation, Candracchattra, on the strength o f his superknowledges and by the pow er o f his incantations, made the wheel o f the D harm a turn just as the Tathagata Bhaisajyaraja had done and continued to do so for ten short aeons.“ Prince o f gods, while the m onk Candracchattra was exerting himself thus to protect the holy Dharm a, thousands o f millions o f living beings reached the stage o f irreversibility on the path to unexcelled, perfect enlightenment, fourteen billion living beings were disciplined in the vehicles o f the disciples and solitary sages, and innumerable living beings took rebirth in the hum an and heavenly realms.“ Perhaps, prince o f gods, you are w ondering or experiencing some doubt about whether or not, at that former time, the King Ratnacchattra was not some other than the actual Tathagata Ratnarcis.13 You must not imagine that, for the present Tathagata Ratnarcis was at that time, in that epoch, the universal monarch Ratnacchattra.

But if they hear such a teaching, they will rejoice, will believe, and will accept it upon the crowns o f their heads. Hence, in order to protect those future noble sons and daughters, you must spread a teaching such as this!“ Maitreya, there are tw o gestures o f the bodhisattvas.15 W hat are they? The first gesture is to believe in all sorts o f phrases and words, and the second gesture is to penetrate exactly the profound principle o f the D harm a w ithout being afraid. Such are the tw o gestures o f the bodhisattvas. Maitreya, it must be know n that the bodhisattvas w ho believe in all sorts o f words and phrases, and apply themselves accordingly, are beginners and not experienced in religious practice. But the bodhisattvas w ho read, hear, believe, and teach this profound teaching with its impeccable expressions reconciling dichotomies and its analyses o f stages o f developm ent— these are veterans in the religious practice.“ Maitreya, there are tw o reasons the beginner bodhisattvas hurt themselves and do not concentrate on the profound Dharma. W hat are they ? Hearing this profound teaching never before heard, they are terrified and doubtful, do not rejoice, and reject it, thinking, ‘W hence comes this teaching never before heard?’ They then behold other noble sons accepting, becoming vessels for, and teaching this profound teaching, and they do not attend upon them, do not befriend them, do not respect them, and do not honor them, and eventually they go so far as to criticize them. These are the two reasons the beginner bodhisattvas hurt them­selves and do not penetrate the profound Dharma.“ There are tw o reasons the bodhisattvas w ho do aspire to the profound D harm a hurt themselves and do not attain the tolerance o f the ultimate birthless- ness o f things. W hat are these tw o? These bodhisattvas despise and reproach the beginner bodhisattvas, who have not been practicing for a long time, and they do not initiate them or instruct them in the profound teaching. Having no great respect for this profound teaching, they are not careful about its rules. They help living beings by means o f material gifts and do not help them by means o f the gift o f the Dharma. Such, Maitreya, are the tw o reasons the bodhisattvas w ho aspire to the profound D harm a hurt themselves and will n o t quickly attain the tolerance o f the ultimate birthlessness o f all things.”Thus having been taught, the bodhisattva Maitreya said to the Buddha, “ Lord, the beautiful teachings o f the Tathagata are wonderful and truly excellent.

Your w ord is well given!-The Tathagata rejoices and commends your.good promise.”Then all the bodhisattvas said together in one voice, “ Lord, we also, after the ultimate liberation o f the Tathagata, will come from our various buddha- fields to spread far and wide this enlightenment o f the perfect Buddha, the Tathagata. May all noble sons and daughters believe in that!”Then the four Maharajas, the great kings o f the quarters,16 said to the Buddha, “ Lord, in all the towns, villages, cities, kingdoms, and palaces, wherever this discourse o f the D harm a will be practised, upheld, and correctly taught, we, the four great kings, will go there with our armies, our young warriors, and our retinues, to hear the Dharma. And we will protect the teachers o f this Dharma for a radius o f one league so that no one w ho plots injury or disruption against these teachers will have any opportunity to do them h arm .”Then the Buddha said to the venerable Ananda, “ Receive then, Ananda, this expression o f the teaching o f the Dharma.
