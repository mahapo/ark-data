Later, after he had been teachings for some years, he ex-plained that he had been presenting his teaching in stages, with each stage showing an increasingly profound meaning; for example, he stated in the Great Vehicle siitra called Unravelling the Intent Sutra, that he had presented the exo-teric or siitra teachings in three stages. In addition to that, it is accepted by his followers that his presentation of the eso-teric or tantra teachings was a fourth stage. Each of these four stages was called a \"turning of the wheel of dharma\", with \"wheel\" meaning a \"complete level or sphere\" of dharma or spiritual truth, and \"turning'' meaning that the teaching of that particular level of spiritual truth, one which had been either lost from or not previously taught in human society, was being set in motion. v"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"vi INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS The Buddha also explained in the Unravelling the Intent Sutra, that he taught in stages like that for the sake of his disciples, so thatthey could gradually led from their state of confusion into full realization of the truth and illustrated his method with the analogy of spoon-feeding children. Thus, the Buddha himself said before he began teaching that emptiness would be a fundament of his teaching. However, when he turned the wheels of dharma, he showed emptiness in varying degrees of profunqity and it is not always obvious exactly how he taught emptiness within them. Therefore, it became essential for. all of his followers to determine exactly how emptiness had been taught through the various turnings of the wheel. This matter of emptiness and how it is to be understood throughout the turnings of the wheel of dharma is very subtle, so his followers arrived at varying ways of explaining it in accordance with their own capacity to understand the subtlety involved. Generally speaking, their determinations resulted in four main schools of Buddhist philosophy: two for those who accepted only the first turning of the wheel of dharma-called Particularist and Sutra Followers-and two for follow-ers who either accepted all three sutra turnings or accepted both those three and the fourth tantra turning-called Mind Only and Middle Way. Of the four main schools, the Middle Way school is regarded as the one having the highest presentation of how the Buddha taught emptiness. Many sub-schools of the Middle Way arose in India, as the great Indian masters who were both"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION vii studied and practised turned their attention to this matter and arrived at their own determinations of them. The various schools of thought mentioned spread from India to other countries. Three of the four major schools of Ti-betan Buddhism-the Nyingma, Kagyu, and Sakya schools-and a couple of smaller schools-such as theJonang school which is important to this book and about which more will be said later-were direct continuations of Indian Buddhist schools of thought that received their views on emptiness and the turnings of the wheel directly from Indian sources. These schools arose in the period from the eighth to twelfth centu-ries C.E. Much later, in the fifteenth century, a fourth major school of Tibetan Buddhism-the Gelugpa school-arose based on the teachings of its founder Lord Tsongkhapa [13 57-1419]; it is noteworthy that this school was not a direct continuation of an Indian school of Buddhism and therefore did not get the teaching regarding emptiness and the turnings of the wheel directly from Indian sources. All of these Tibetan Buddhist schools accepted and followed all four turnings of the wheel of dharma, and all of them followed one or another of the Middle Way sub-schools of thought regarding emptiness. Generally speaking, the Nyingma, Kagyu, Jonang, and some followers of the Sakya school had a common approach to emptiness and howithad been taught through the four turn-ings and agreed that, in essence, their views were the same. The remaining Sakya school followers and the Gelugpa school had their own, common approach to this matter that was different to that of the first group. The difference"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"viii INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS between the two groups succinctly stated is that the first group claims that emptiness was taught in both the second and third turnings and that the ultimate teaching on empti-ness is to be found in the third turning, whereas the second group claimed that it emptiness was only to taught in the second turning and that the presentation of emptiness found there is ultimate. There are many other points of difference that follow on from that, for instance differences of under-standing how emptiness was taught in the fourth turning, but to go into that here would complicate this discussion un-necessarily. The view of emptiness held by the Gelugpa school was, as could be guessed from the foregoing information, a minority view in Tibet. However, the school became the established church in Lhasa, the seat of political power in Central Tibet, and made a concerted effort during many centuries to domi-nate the other schools in Tibet. Its views spread widely and even today it is still thought by many outside Tibet that the view of Tsongkhapa and his Gelugpa school is the accepted view within all schools of Tibetan Buddhism. In fact, it is a minority view, with the majority of Tibetan Buddhists not subscribing to Tsongkhapa's explanations of emptiness. Thus, one reason for writing this book is to draw attention to the majority view of emptiness in Tibet in which the ultimate teaching on emptiness is found in the third turning of the wheel."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION ix In the early fourteenth century C.E., the head of the Jonang school, Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen [1292-1361], stated in his writings that the view of emptiness which his school found within the teachings of the third turning should be called \"empty-of-other emptiness\" or \"other emptiness\" (\"zhan-tong\" in Tibetan1) and, in relation to that, that the emptiness taughtwithinin the second turning should be called \"empty-of-self emptiness\" or \"self emptiness\" (\"rangtong\" in Tibet-an). As a result, they become !mown as a school that followed the Other Emptiness system of view and meditation. Fallowing that, the other schools with the same basic view-the Nyingma, Kagyu, and so on as mentioned above-also proclaimed that they foxllowed the Other Emptiness system of view and meditation. Of importance here is that the third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje [1284-1339], who was the head of the Karma Kagyu school at the time, visited Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen and, after discussions with him, announced that the view of the Kagyu school was exactly that of Other Empti-ness. In fact, the Kagyu school had, since its inception in ancient India, followed the system of view and meditation which was now being called \"Other Emptiness\" in Tibet-the only change involved was the name being used to describe the approach. The author of the text in this book, the firstJamgon Kong-trul, was a principal holder of the Karma Kagyu lineage in the nineteenth century, and is well-known for having been a major advocate of the Other Emptiness view. J amgon Kong-trul was famous for travelling through Tibet to obtain teach-ings from various schools, then writing them down and propagating them so that they would not be lost. In this case,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"x INSTRUCfiONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS he went to Dzam Thang, which had become the headquarters of the Jonang school in East Tibet, received the full instruc-tions on the view and meditation of other emptiness from the head of the school at the time-as mentioned at the end of the text, then wrote them down in a manual of instructions for practising Other-Emptiness. That manual forms the body of this book. Another reason then, for writing this book, is to show that Other Emptiness is a practical teaching of the Buddha intended as a means for the attainment of enlighten-ment. The J onang school gets its name from] omo, a place south of Lhasa in Central Tibet, which had become the headquarters of the followers of Yumowa Mikyo Dorje, a highly realized yogin of the Kalachakra Tantra. When a later throne holder of the Jonang school, Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, ·made his presentations of \"other emptiness\" mentioned above, it greatly upset the hierarchs of the established Buddhist church in Central Tibet. They proclaimed that their presentation of emptiness based on the logic ofTsongkhapa was correct and that the presentation of \"other emptiness\" was heretical. They eventually closed down the Jonang school by force, leaving the followers of the school no choice but to leave Central Tibet for East Tibet where they re-established them-selves out of reach of further harm. Since that time, followers of the Gelugpa school have held a running verbal battle with all the schools who uphold the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xi other emptiness position. That has led to the Other Empti-ness system of teaching becoming thought of as a philosophi-cal teaching full of all sorts of debatable topics, which is a complete mistake. The Other Emptiness system is based on the Buddha's teachings of the third turning of the wheel. Its view is very profound, being essentially the same as the view of the tan-tras. Moreover, it is a complete teaching, with view, medita-tion, and conduct, taught by the Buddha as a means for attaining enlightenment. When it is taught as a view and meditation-or theory and practice-for the attainment of enlightenment, much of the philosophical argument that its opponents drummed up is not only not needed but is simply not presented to disciples. When Other Emptiness is pre-sented for what it is, it is a very profound yet straightforward teaching of view, with a profound yet straightforward medita-tion practice to go with it. Therefore, this book does not to bother with dissertations of the polemic which have come to surround the system of Other Emptiness. Rather, it takes its place amongst our several books on Other Emptiness\\ all showing that the Other Emptiness teaching is not an academic exercise for deep philosophical discussion but a teaching given by the Buddha as a profound means for the attainment of enlighten-ment. This book has the specific feature of presenting a manual of instructions for actually practising the path to enlightenment according to the Other Emptiness view as presented by the J onang lineage, the lineage whose followers first coined the name \"other emptiness\" in Tibet."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Xll INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS The Text in this Book, \"Instructions for Practising the View of the Other Emptiness Great Middle Way\" One of our several books on Other Emptiness is a large tome called Other Emptiness, a Complete Exposition of the Zhantong System3 which features extensive explanations of the theory and practice of Other Emptiness; it is recommended reading for those who would like to examine Other Emptiness in depth. The book starts with my own extensive explanations of Other Emptiness given in plain English, then continues with a rich set of translations of the writings and teachings of Tibetan teachers of the Karma Kagyu school, a tradition which has been based in the Other Emptiness approach from its very beginning in ancient India. Teachings of the Nying-ma and J onang lineages are included in order to give a very complete picture of the theory and practice of the Other Emptiness system. The following five paragraphs are excerpted from Other Emptiness, a Complete Exposition of the Zhantong System to show the resources available in it and to give the reader an idea of how the text in this book fits into the teaching of Other Emptiness: In the traditional Buddhist way of thinking, before a teaching on a profound view is given, the audience has to be shown the lineage in order to have faith in it. Accordingly, a very clear presentation of the history, given by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyatso when he was teaching at Rumtek Monastery in Sikkhim, is provided."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION Following that, the view should be presented suc-cincdy. Emptiness of Other was fully taught by the Buddha in the siitras and tantras, though the teach-ing of his regent Maitreya, which comes in a set of five texts called The Five Dharmas ofMaitreya, is especially focussed on this view, and, in particular, the presentation contained in the one called Great Vehicle Highest Crmtinuum Treatise expounds the view very clearly. Jamgon Kongtrul the Great wrote a major commentary to the Highest Crmtin-uum from the Empty of Other perspective which he called The Lion's Roar of the Non-Regressing Commen-tary to the Highest Crmtinuum. The lengthy intro-duction of the Lion's Roar Commentary has been included because it contains a wealth of background material. That is followed by a key selection from Jamgon Kongtrul's very famous Treasury ofKnO'Wl-edge with the ascertainment of provisional and de-finitive meaning4 within the three wheels and within the two truths, ascertainments which are crucial to determining the view of Emptiness of Other. The selection also includes ascertainment of the view of each of the main tenet systems of Buddhism culminating in the view of the Empty of Other Middle Way. These presentations are also crucial to developing a correct understanding of the Empty of Other view. Once the view has been succinctly presented in a theoretical way, it has to be followed by oral in-struction that makes the view come alive. Several chapters based on teachings given by Khenpo xiii"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xiv INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS Tsultrim Gyatso as oral instruction to his disciples, address this need. After the view has been understood theoretically and some certainty has been gained through oral instruction, the next step is to meditate on the view in order to bring it forth as fact within one's mind-stream. Khenpo Tsultrim's complete explanations of the view and especially the meditation of Empty of Other, as shown in two of the most important songs of Milarepa, are available in another book on Other Emptiness called The Theory and Practice of Other Emptiness Taught Thruugh Milarepa's Smg;. Finally, a practice manual for Other Emptiness is needed, and this is provided through an excerpt of the text Instructi(JflS for Practising the View of the Other Emptiness Great Middle Way, \"light Rays of Stainless Vajra MO(Jfl\". The textlnstructi(JflSfor Practising the View of the Other Empti-ness Great Middle Way just mentioned is the text which forms the body of this book. The colophon of the text indicates that it was written by Jamgon Kongtrul Yon tan Gyatso, one of the several names of the firstJamgon Kongtrul It has the feature of being what is called a \"lta khrid\" in Tibetan, which is a set of instructions for doing the meditation practice that goes with any given view. Within Buddhism, there are many scholarly works that go into the depths of the various views found within Buddhist philosophy, but there are only a few of these instructions manuals that show how to actually practise those views."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION XV These instruction manuals are of no interest to those who spend their lives in scholarly pursuit of the Buddhist teaching, but for those few who are determined to take the view they have studied and turn it into direct experience through meditation, these guides are exceptionally valuable and are treated with great reverence. All in all, the text in this book is not just another of many Tibetan philosophical texts on the view but is a complete rarity, one of very few texts that ex-plain how to practise the view of Other Emptiness. Pertinent to this book is that I received extensive, private teachings on Other Emptiness from the Karma Kagyu Khen-chen Thrangu Rinpoche in which he explained the entirety of Ju Mipham's famous text on the subject called The Lion's Roar that Proclaims Zhantonl. When I asked for information on the meditation of Other Emptiness rather than its view, Thrangu Rinpoche pointed me to this text Instructions for Practising the View by J amgon Kongtrul, provided me with the necessary reading transmission, then asked me to translate it. I found that The Lion's Roar that Proclaims Zhantong and this Instructions for Practising the View complement each other well, the former being a guide to the theory and the latter being a guide to the practice of Other Emptiness. Counteracting the Effects of Opposition to Other Emptiness As mentioned earlier, the Gelugpa school concluded that the Other Emptiness system of teaching was heretical and be-came vehemently opposed to it. Followers of the Gelugpa school in general presents themselves with the belief that they alone are the ones who correctly understand the Buddha's teaching on emptiness. That they have this attitude is not my"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xvi INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS idea; it is frequendy mentioned in writings of the followers of the schools they opposed. For example,Ju Mipham repeat-edly castigates them in his The Lion's Roar that Proclaims Zhantong for their close-minded attitudes, including their well-lmown unwillingness even to listen to the views of others before condemning them. And Jamgon Kongtrul says of them in his Instructions for Practising the View of the Other Emptiness Great Middle Way: ... the group with the pretentiousness of taking the empty experiences of general concept and analysis as being the dharmata who say, \"The Great Middle Way is like ours alone; everyone else is mistaken!\" are lost regarding the path ... and makes other derogatory comments about them too. Driven by these attitudes, Gelugpa scholars wrote trenchant criticisms of Other Emptiness in order to eliminate it. In reply, experts among the followers of Other Emptiness wrote texts to counter their arguments. Both sides had scholars with great lmowledge, so the arguments became extensive and subtle, and are not easy to follow without a very sharp mind, significant knowledge of the Buddha's teachings throughout the siitras, and Buddhist philosophies of perception. For example, The Lion's Roar that Proclaims Zhantongwas written in defence of Other Emptiness and provides an excellent example of how extensive, subtle, and difficult to understand the arguments became. The result of this warfare was that Other Emptiness became, in Tibet, something which seemed to be all about philosophi-cal argument. Because of that, Westerners have developed"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xvii the notion that Other Emptiness is only about philosophical argument and, with that, the understanding that it is about practice seems to have been lost. In regard to this, The Lion's Roar that Proclaims Zhantong contains a thread of argument that Other Emptiness is based in direct perception of reality arrived at through meditation practice, yet it does not show the actual practice of the view, and its style of composition supports the idea that the system of Other Emptiness is all about deep philosophical argument. In· comparison, this Instructions for Practising the View explicitly shows that Other Emptiness is not intended for academic pursuit but, like all Buddhist theory, is meant as a basis for practice done to return us to our original, enlightened condition. Another of our books on Other Emptiness, called The Theory and Practice Of Other Emptiness Taught Through Milarepa's Songs, was compiled and published to assist with dispelling the wrong notions that Other Emptiness is a philosophical view meant for argument and that it has no practical application. It shows the view of Other Emptiness as part of the path to enlightenment and shows the meditation for practising it. The book is especially noteworthy for its thorough treatment of Milarepa's song An Authentic Expression of the Middle Way, a song which is famous for showing all levels of the Kagyu view in a compact presentation of Milarepa's realization. The song is regarded in the Kagyu school as one of the most important ofMilarepa's songs and is frequently used as a basis for teaching the Kagyu view, including Other Emptiness."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"XVln INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS A Brief Introduction to the System of Other Emptiness The Buddha presented his teachings in steps, each one called a \"turning of the wheel of dharma\": In the first turning, he did not address emptiness directly but focussed on showing his disciples that they were in an unsatisfactory condition and that they needed to escape from it. He used the analogy which has become famous, of being in a house on fire. In the second turning, he explicitly taught emptiness in what were called \"the Prajiiaparamita siitras\". In these siitras, he taught that the self-nature that ordi-nary beings see in their own persons and in the phe-nomena of their worlds is a mistake. He taught that all such persons and phenomena are absent or empty of that kind of self-nature. Thus, he taught emptiness in these siitras and the emptiness that he taught was the emptiness of a self of persons and of phenomena. In the third turning, he taught in various ways, but all those ways pointed to the fact that sentient beings have within their normal, complicated minds a subtle core which is the same type of thing as the mind of an enlightened being. The teachings of the third turning are generally understood to mean that all sentient beings have in them the cause of enlightenment. However, a very profound understanding of emptiness was also taught in conjunction with them. Unlike the emptiness of self-nature teaching given in the second turning of the wheel, the teaching of this profound"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xix understanding does not focus on the mistaken side of phe-nomena in order to remove that mistakenness but focusses on the core of mind taught as the cause of enlightenment. That core of mind, or sugatagarbha as it is referred to in these teachings, is the same type of thing7 as enlightened mind; it is not the same kind of thing as the samsaric mind which sees mistakenly. Therefore, this core of enlightened mind is different in entity from the samsaric mind. Therefore, the core of enlightened mind does not have, within its own entity, the samsaric mind. Therefore, this kind of teaching was called \"empty of other\" meaning that the core of enlightened mind is \"empty of everything which is other than it\", where everything other than it is the samsaric mind and all of its paraphernalia. The Buddha did teach that meaning, then officially entrusted it to his regent, Maitreya, who then passed it on to Indian masters. From them, it went into some of the Tibetan schools, one of which, the J onang, gave it the name \"Other Emptiness\" or \"Zhantong'' in Tibetan and gave the name \"Self Emptiness\" or \"Rangtong\" in Tibetan to the teachings of the second turning of the wheel. These two names were then used by the followers of the Other Emptiness system but not by others. The Tibetan schools who followed only the emptiness teach-ings of the second turning of the wheel of dharma, the Gelug-pa and Sakya schools, did not accept the emptiness of other · teaching. For them, the teachings of the second turning were where the Buddha taught emptiness and the teachings of the third turning were where the Buddha taught that all sentient beings have the cause ofbuddhahood in them"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"xx INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS That brings us to a crucial point about the Other Emptiness system of teaching: it does not reject the teaching of the emptiness of self found in the second turning of the wheel in favour of the teaching of other emptiness which it finds in the third turning. Instead, it regards the teaching of emptiness of self in the second turning as an indispensable step towards the teaching of emptiness of other found in the third turning. Understanding this is useful in two ways. Firstly, it is an important point of the view of Other Emptiness and has to be understood by anyone who follows that system as a practical path to enlightenment. Secondly, opponents of Other Emp-tiness often argue that the system of Other Emptiness rejects the Buddha's teaching of emptiness of a self-nature in the second turning of the wheel; an understanding of the crucial point just mentioned allows one of their important arguments against Other Emptiness to be readily dismissed. Having understood this crucial point that the Other Empti-ness schools require that the emptinesses taught in both the second and third turnings be understood and then practised in the order in which they were taught, various issues con-cerning how the two emptinesses should be understood and practised come to light. One issue is the style of definition of the two emptinesses. The siitras of the second turning consistently teach that emptiness is to be understood and practised through the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xxi absolute negation of mistaken phenomena; for example, this can be seen in the Heart Prajiiaparamita Sutra when says, ... no path, no wisdom, no attainment, and also no attainment ... The siitras of the third turning do not absolutely negate in order to remove something which is mistaken, because that step has already been completed by determining emptiness of a self-nature in the second turning. They take the next step of negating yet affirming in order to distinguish clearly what is left after the mistaken parts have been removed. The particular thing that they affirm is wisdom, in the form of a seed of enlightenment, called sugatagarbha. In this two-step approach, the siitras of the second turning will say that the core of mind which is innate wisdom, sugatagarbha, does not truly exist, meaning that a wisdom conceived of as a truly existent thing does not exist in fact. However, the siitras of the third turning, following on from that, say, \"Wisdom truly is existent\" meaning that, of the two possibilities of wisdom existing and not-existing, it has to be said that wisdom exists. For someone who has become used to the approach of the siitras of the second turning, the words \"wisdom truly is existent\" will seem to be in direct contradiction to what the Buddha taught in the second turning, which is that phenom-ena do not truly exist. One can easily understand how someone who is clinging tightly to the style of emptiness taught in the second turning would conclude that the teachings of Other Emptiness, which emphasise the approach of saying that the core of mind, innate wisdom, does indeed exist, go directly"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"xxii INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS against the Buddha's teaching. One can even see how one group might become very upset and raise cries of \"heresy!\" Nevertheless, one can also see that there is a progression of teaching, just as the Buddha said, and that each approach has its place and that both are equally important. The key here is to understand that the emptiness of self taught in the second turning relies on one type of negation, where the emptiness of other taught in the third turning relies on another type of negation. The teachings on emptiness of the second turning negate a false existence using logic based in what is called \"non-affirming negation\", whereas the teachings on emptiness of the third turning differentiate whether something can be said to be a certain way or not using what is called \"affirming negation\". Then one can easily understand that the Other Emptiness followers have not rejected the emptiness of self the second turning of the wheel but have put that first and then, on the basis of that, have moved to a much more subtle presentation of innate wisdom which is empty of other. A more complete presentation of the two types of negation and how they relate to the two types of emptiness-self and other-is outside the scope of this book; the reader is again referred to Other F:mptiness, a C01'1tplete Exposition of the Zhan-tong System for a thorough treatment of the issue. From this point on, the explanations of the view of Other Emptiness become more difficult to understand and require for their comprehension expertise in both the Buddha's teachings and logical argument. Nevertheless, the approach of Other Emptiness can be summed up as follows."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xxiii In general, to become enlightened means to put an end to mistaken, samsaric mind and to return to enlightened mind, called wisdom, which has been completely purified of that samsaric mind. The self-empty approach to doing that, shown in the second turning of the wheel, is one in which the samsaric mind is used against itself to overcome itself-this can lead into wisdom but only in an indirect way, because it is an approach which stays in samsaric mind while trying to end samsaric mind. The other-empty approach of the third turning acknowledges, using simple logic, that every sentient being has wisdom innately present in the form of the core of enlightened mind called sugatagarbha. Unlike the things of samsaric mind which had to be removed in the second turn-ing of the wheel, this is not a mistaken entity, but something which is present and could be direcdy accessed if one knew how to do it. The most profound teachings given by the Buddha in connection with sugatagarbha included instruc-tions on how to access that mind direcdy, without the need of logic. The style of the view and meditation of those most profound siitra teachings is the same as the view and medita-tion of the tantras taught in the fourth turning of the wheel. The difference between these two very profound approaches is that the siitra teachings show them a little less clearly whereas the tantric teachings expose them fully and in the most uninhibited way possible. As mentioned earlier, a more technical description of Other Emptiness can be found in the books Other Emptiness, a C01'1tplete Exposition of the Zhantong System and The Lion's Roar that Proclaims Zhantong. There is also a presentation of the non-dual view of Kalachakra Tantra in which the Other Emptiness system is clearly exposed by the second Drukchen,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"xxiv INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS Gyalwang Je8• Finally, Maitripa's Writings on the View, The Main Indian Suurce of the Tibetan Views of Other Emptinesl shows very clearly the view c:f Maitripa, who is the pivotal Indian source for all the Other Emptiness teachings that came into Tibet. Validating the Source of the Teaching As mentioned above, Other Emptiness is a teaching of the Buddha intended as a means for the attainment of enlighten-ment. It is a complete teaching of the path to enlightenment with a view, meditation, and conduct at both siitra and tantra levels. Wishing to eliminate this system in its entirety, the opponents to Other Emptiness dismiss it by claiming that it is an invention of heretics. To assess their claim, it is neces-sary to look at the history of the Other Emptiness system and investigate whether it is actually the teaching of the Buddha. The text which forms the body of this book begins with a clear explanation of the source of the Other Emptiness teaching presented in the text. It shows that the Other Emptiness system is the teaching of the Buddha but does not prove the matter so convincingly as the excellent history contained in the book Other Emptiness, a Cumplete Exposition of the Zhantong System, mentioned earlier. Very briefly, the siitra teaching of Other Emptiness begins with the Buddha himself. Sets of ten and twenty siitras from the third turning of the wheel have been picked out by Other Emptiness followers as the core siitras which teach Other Emptiness10• Maitreya in particular taught the Other Empti-ness view to his disciples and the lineage went from him to noble one Asaiiga to the Indian master Maitripa. From there,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION XXV it went into the Tibetan tradition in various ways, such as through Marpa the Translator and through the exceptionally learned Sajjana of Kashmir who taught it to his disciples, who then took it into Tibet. The tantric system specifically connected with the Tibetan term \"zhantong\" was the Kalachakra Tantra as practised by the} onang school. However, the tantras as a whole have the approach of Other Emptiness and were taught by the Buddha himself or his appointed holder of the tantras, Vajrapiil}.i. Thus, Other Emptiness as seen in the tantric teachings is also a teaching of the Buddha and not something made up by later followers of the Buddha. Whole Schools Follow Other Emptiness The Instructions for Practising the View puts the oral instruc-tions of the Other Emptiness tradition, both siitra and tantra, into one text that shows the view and how to practise it according to theJonang school of Tibet. However, as was mentioned earlier, Other Emptiness is not restricted to the Jonang school. The Kagyus and Nyingmas as a whole, and some parts of the Sakya tradition, maintain that the view underpinning all of their practice is Other Emptiness. The Kagyus and Nyingmas lay out their practice of tantra in a way that embodies Other Emptiness fully, though for the Nying-ma, when it comes to the practice of Dzogchen, most masters teach that Other Emptiness is a slightly hidden presentation of what Dzogchen teaches explicitly. Thus, the text here shows theJonang approach to practising Other Emptiness per se, though it is applicable to everyone"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"xxvi INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS who is a follower of the Tibetan Buddhist schools which base themselves on the Other Empty approach. Disclaimer It is important for me to say and for the reader to understand that I do not write here with a bias against one school or for another. In particular, I am not using this book as a platform to denigrate the Gelugpa school. In fact, I started my dharma journey in this life as a monk ordained in that school and was one of the founders of the first Gelugpa monastery in my homeland, Australia, where I spent many years studying and practising the Gelugpa teachings on emptiness in forest retreats. I have nothing but the greatest respect for the school's kindness.

GENERALLY In general, the conqueror's word is not classified into provi-sional and definitive12 on the basis of something in it being mistaken or untrue, but on whether or not a person's intellect is unable or able, respectively, to engage the object which is outside the reach of conceptn. There was, in the manner of spoon-feeding children, the first wheel of the word bringing renunciation of sarpsiira, the middle one turning away grasping at characteristics, and the final one precisely distinguishing the meaning of actuality as existent and non-existent, is and is not, and so on. Based on that progression of meaning, the first one has been made out to be provisional meaning, the middle one to be mixed provi-sional and definitive, and the final one to be unsurpassable definitive meaning. That cannot be condemned because it is established by authentic statement in the classifications made by the conqueror and his sons in Unravelling the Intent Siitra14, and so on, and in addition, because the profound 5"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"6 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS meaning is also established in a process of gradually becoming clearer that culminates in perfectly complete, direct percep-tion of it15• Still, because the mode of the fictional's appearance was taught in the middle turning as \"not existent in non-exis-tence\" and the mode of the superfactual's emptiness16 was taught in the final turning as \"existent in existence\", Shantipa and the others maintained17 that the intents of both middle and final wheels18 and of the two great charioteers who initiated their systems19 too, come down to the same point. They relied on the twenty siitras of the final wheel collec-tively known as the heart of definitive meaning siitra section, on Maitreya's Five Dharmas, and on the textual systems of Nagarjuna and Asanga, fathers and sons20• And then here in Tibet, too, starting from the time of the two, Zu the transla-tor and Tsan21 there were various systems of explanation of this view which became known as \"The Other Emptiness Middle Way\" and in the time up until no~2 there have been three great system-setting charioteers of this teaching-All-Seeing Rangjung Dorje, All-Knowing Dolpopa, and All-Knowing Drimey Ozer. Then, there were the Seventh Lord23, Zilung Pa!fchen, Taranatha, Tenpay Nyinje24, and others who were definitely seated on the levels of the noble ones and who were fully complete spiritual friends of the teaching possessing the eye of dharma which does not fall into sides who also determined the matter through listening, explaining, and meditating and whose recorded words as a whole have become supports for the tradition25• There is more to it than that though-the ultimate mind of the noble beings who see unmistaken actuality through"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE TEXT 7 integrated hearing, contemplation, and meditation, arrive at only this26• 8. SPECIFICALLY Specifically, an instruction manual for the profound view could present two systems of the view. There is the common system of guidance on the view which was skilfully exposed by the one who had complete mastery of the meaning intended in the Highest Continuum, Maitripa, and his lineage consisting of Ratnavajra the Great Central Pillar, Sajjana of Kashmir, and so on. Then there is the system that derives from the path of empowerment in which there is transference of blessings; coming to life in Jetsun Lhodrakpa27 and well known as the Kagyu, this is the uncommon system of the Mahiimudrii of sutra and mantra united. The former of the two will be explained here."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE ACTUAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRACTISING TO THE VIEW I. THE SUTRA SYSTEM THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN FEET A. What is to be understood The Buddha's teaching that trusts in the infallibility of cause and effect is the correct view for a worldling; this is set as the basis. Then, on top of that, in order to transcend the three realms, it is necessary to rely on an unmistaken view of the profound. For that, shravakas will meditate on the meaning that comes from the determination oflack of self of a person, pratyekabuddhas on lack of self in what is grasped28, Yoga-charms on wisdom of emptiness of both, and ordinary Middle Y\\-Tayists on all phenomena themselves being empty of self-entity. By meditating on the meanings that come from those determinations they gain experience but, because they remain totally constrained by the three things of mind, .perceptions, and mistaken views, they do not get to a determination of non-dual wisdom and with that, buddhahood is a long way off. 8"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE TEXT 9 This brings the question: who does experience that non-dual wisdom? The answer is that it is seen by the wisdom of a fully characterized noble one and, in accordance with that, by those individualized beings29 whose mindstreams are cleansed with uncommon hearing, contemplating, and meditating. The latter type falls into two categories as follows. The advocates of lack of essentiality decide, using the five great reasonings of the Middle Way0, that all phenomena from form up to omniscience are emptiness-that in actuality they are, like the horns of a rabbit and the son of a barren woman, not referenced at all and not existing as anything whatso-ever-that shines forth unceasingly in appearances of interde-pendent origination. Then, at the time of the main part31, just as both a rubbing stick and its supporting stick are con-sumed by the fire produced from rubbing them together and finally the fire itself disappears of itself, similarly, when clinging concept has been evaluated by individually discrimi-nating concept32, the prajiia itself of the individually discrimi-nating concept settles into non-referencing in which there is no mind process33 whatsoever, no involvement in mentation about anything whatsoever3\\ but realization oflack of self in a space-like state. If meditation is done like that as a no meditation done in that kind of state, many doors of unified Shamatha-vipashyana type concentration, such as the Jewel Lamp, and so on, will be born. When that happens, if a good introduction using authentic statement and foremost instruc-tion35 is received, then the mistaken graspings will be purified and prajiia will leap up, and there will be a realization of the view of the uncommon Great Middle Way6•"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"10 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS That being so, when it says in Volume on Accumulations for Samadhi17, One might have developed an utterly stable samadhi, But if there is overt clinging happening within it, It can only be called \"the usual behaviour of children\" And it will not obtain nirval).a ... it means that the group with the pretentiousness of taking the empty experiences belonging to generic examination and analysis as being the dharmata38, the ones who say, The Great Middle Way is like ours alone; everyone else is mistaken! are lost regarding the path39• Then, there is a group who, not having liberated self-entity into a state beyond rational mind, enumerate birth and cessation and confuse that with Mahamudra; they are lost regarding the character that is definite experience40• Both groups are the same in that they have some degree of attribute analysis of names41 but other than that are incapable oflifting themselves up above the three realms. Thus, no-one will disagree that, in terms of passing through the door of all-knowing wisdom, unmistaken authoritative statement, rea-soning, and foremost instruction will produce understanding, experience, and realization when rock meets bone, neverthe-less, it does require that a view, meditation, and conduct that is superior to all is brought to bear42•"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE TEXT 11 As for the Yogacharins relying on Maitreya's dharmas, the ones who have used the textual systems belonging to the mid-dle wheel of the word together with the commentaries on its intent to cut the elaborations of adventitious, confused appearances of dharmins43 as a preliminary are the best ones. People who cannot deal with that degree of elaborateness definitely must study Maitreya's Five Dharmas or at least the Highest Continuum to the point of having certainty in such. For those for whom even that is not possible, then, as has been said44, That there is nothing other than mind is known rationally; Then from that, mind also is realized to be non-existent; Those with good rational mind will know both as non-existent·45 , Then one dwells in that without it, the dharmadhatu.46 That is to say, without beginning, one's own mind, due to the factor of ignorance, adventitious stains, has had various appearances like dreams' confusions, coming on its non-examining, non-analyzing face yet, if the appearances are analyzed, because each one, not being established at ali, is empty of self-entity, all of them are just mind's trickery. Thus, the grasped47 appearances that shine forth seemingly as outer objects but which lack any nature and which are like moons in water, are the actuality of fictional truth. They and the grasping mind which also does not reside anywhere outside or inside and does not exist as a thing of shape and colour, together with its parts, the eightfold group48 which arises from the stream of grasping at a self which is the"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"12 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS confusion of taking something to exist where there is nothing, are, like a sky-flower, primordially empty. They are primor-dially empty yet there is the wisdom empty of both the grasped and grasping that pervades everything from buddha ·through to sentient beings-the dharmata sugatagarbha49-which has the nature ofluminosity0• To correcdyrecognize that luminosity which has, primordially, never been covered by the adventitious stains, which is the actuality of superfactu-al truth, then to put yourself in equipoise on its state is the understanding that goes with Maitreya's dharmas. Just that much analysis must be done as a preliminary for the purpose of ascertainment. Freedom from extremes is determined with that and then there is what is called \"practising unification\" which is to remain in the actuality that is the innate, self-arising wisdom. The style of emptiness here is called \"being empty of the concepts that come from grasping at the ex-tremes of elaboration\". The style of realization here is called \"realization by individual self-knowing wisdom 51\". B. How to practise that i. The preliminaries In accordance with the progressive sequence of purification of the gross, subde, and very subtle stains of the wish-fulfilling-jewel-like sugatagarbha52, to begin with, you are to meditate on thoughts consistent with the dharma siitras which correspond to the first wheel. Meditate on this: It is like this: birth ends in death, coming together ends in separation, accumulation ends in dissipa-tion, rise ends in fall. Every one of these composite dharmas are even more impermanent than bubbles and lightning. In dependence on the appropriation"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE TEXT of karma and affliction53, I cycle in and outflow54 into the three realms in the five aggregates of form, and so on, and outflow into the three realms, like an insect trapped in a jar.

And while you are doing that, say this over and over: All composite things are impermanent. Whatever has outflow is unsatisfactory. All phenomena are empty and without self. NiiViilfa is peace. 13 To expand it, mix the ordinary preliminaries found in \"Stages of the Path\" texts56 with your mindstream to the point of having certainty in them. H. The main part a. To make this the path of extraordinary Great Vehicle, first take refuge: As for mind, its nature is luminosity, The virtuous sugatagarbha57• As for sentient beings' appropriation58, The extremes of existence and non-existence are completely abandoned."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"14 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS Just as by burnishing gold colour And Sa-le-dram59 and five-metal alloy Are seen, likewise In the aggregates, sentient beings and persons Do not exist and aggregates do not exist but Buddha wisdom without outflow, Permanent peace is fully meditated on-In that I take refuge.60 Arouse enlightenment mind61: The supreme advocate fully taught That mind's nature which is luminosity Falls into association with the afflictions of Mentation, and so on, and a self.

Setting yourself in equipoise on no-thought freedom from elaboration corresponding to the middle wheel, then crossing ouer to the profound dharmata On a comfortable seat, set your posture according to the usual points of the body62• Cultivate yearning devotion. If you have previously determined the view by hearing and contem-plating, remembering that view, put yourself into equipoise on it. If you do not have the needed hearing and contempla-tion, determine that this mind of yours has no entity at all-which is lack of self of a person-then decide that every appearing object does not exist other than as an appearing factor of your own mind-which is the lack of self of dhar-mas-and then also understand that mind and appearances"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE TEXT 15 are inseparable in the way that water and waves are not different-which is the equal taste of grasped-grasping. Having aroused that understanding, do not be distracted outside; do not withdraw inside; do not grasp in between; and, not going astray into indeterminate states63 or equanim-ity64, rest in an empty way, like space. If your mind does not stay put but starts to have movement, given that whatever appearances of the sixfold group shine forth are empty, if you preserve65 the meditation in self-pacification, self-liberation without engaging at all in acceptance and rejection, hope and fear, suppression and furtherance66, the signs of an abiding mind will gradually occur. Then, by searching for mind as described in the instruction texts, a decision about the nature being primordially free from elaboration will be produced and, because there is no meditation to be done except only for the recognition of that actuality free from elaboration, you must rely simply on a mind that stays inseparable from it. That has also been taught as \"uncontrived freshness\" and as \"whatever arises, the innate\". Thus, no matter how your own luminous, empty, free-from-grasping mind shines forth-abiding or moving, happy or sad, and so on-you preserve just that without alteration. Do not bind yourself up in the conceptual efforts that go with having things to be abandoned and antidotes for them! Instead, put yourself in the non-meditation of supportless rigpa67 and through that the final-ized shamatha-vipashyana of the Great Vehicle will happen.

That understanding frees you from fault that was expressed in these words: Everything the Buddha said taught emptiness and lack of self.

In that way, all the phenomena belonging to the adventitious, totally imaginary75 mind, are empty like the image of gathered clouds, yet the dharmata sugatagarbha, an uninterrupted stream of illumination and knowing76 which has been intro-duced as self-arising wisdom, must be taken into practise. To do so, take refuge and arouse enlightenment mind as de-scribed above.

Tantra to be intellectually understood These appearances of an outer world with its containers and contents of the three becomings104 are, similar to the images that appear on the surface of a mirror, the illusory displays of inner channels, winds, and drops and, as well, the three are present as the superficies of the supreme other maQ.c;lala's sphere together with support and supported 105• All of that also is suchness sugatagarbha's self-light, self-lustre, dharma-kaya itself, supreme unchanging wisdom shining forth as all superficies, which was taught in the tantric sense as super-factual dharmadhatu, unified bliss and emptiness, whose nature is unchanging yet uninterrupted. That, atthe time of the ground when it is suchness with stains, is called \"cause tantra\"; at time of the path it is dharmata's meaning gradually becoming visible, so it is called \"the path, method tantra\"; and when it has been manifested possessing the two purities106, it is called \"highest level of complete purity fruition tantra\". This uncommon view is not even partially seen by the ones who hold the mode \"emptiness of the fictional\" to be su-preme, something that seems barely worth a mention107•"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE TEXT 29 The path of the siitra system explained earlier stands on its own feet but takes a very long time.

Then, by relying on the details of praQ.a and holding of it, melting-bliss is brought on. Recollection and concentration accomplish the ultimate one, the supreme unchanging bliss, and the wind of the latencies of shift is stopped which forces an end to fictional truth's confused appearances. Then, the appearances without any-thing holding them back are ignited without limit or restric-tion. That is the pure self gone to the other shore of bliss and permanence, the dharmakaya freed of stains, the pervasive original buddha primordially residing in oneself made mani-fest. During that time on the path.completely pure friends, samayas, and conduct are necessary; the way to do that has been taught by the dharma lord, and father and sons follow-ing him. And then, having understood what is to be done in accordance with the guru's foremost instructions, you must go and meditate one-pointedly. 3. AN EXPlANATION OF ITS BENEFITS At the end of this age of strife the five dregs111 start up causing the twenty-eight dregs of view112 to arise.

It is taught in the Highest Continuum that the benefits of hearing this profound dharma are greater than especially good generosity, disci-pline, and absorption that result from practise during many aeons. And, generally, there are the benefits of having ori-ented yourself towards the Great Vehicle; as it says in a siitra, Someone who develops a very strong intention towards the Great Vehicle will not go to bad migra-tions for one thousand aeons. For five thousand aeons, he will not be born as an animal or preta. For twenty-five thousand aeons, he will be born in the god worlds and the Brahma worlds. And the Mother114 says, Someone who hears the Prajfiaparamita goes at death and transference to a buddha-field and while alive approaches and honours every sentient being with all enjoyable items. Compared to someone who listens to Prajfiaparamita for an aeon of time, the merit of someone who meditates on it for a period as short as a finger-snap is greater. Especially!ls, the Unravelling the Intent Siitra says, For the atoms in a fingernail and the water in an ox's hoof-print, if the atoms of a great land or the waters of four oceans were made known, they would not be a hundredth, a thousandth, or one"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"32 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS hundred thousandth of them and the matter could not be expressed with example or cause116• Similarly, if you explained what the merit is that accrues from meditation done based on having an intention towards the siitras of provisional meaning, you would not be able to come up with a factor, exa~ple, or cause that showed how small it was compared to the merit accrued from having an intention towards and meditating on the definitive siitra section. Furthermore, a siitra says, My nirviil).a is not from the outside, It is something from within. In sentient beings of every type There is the sugatagarbha. If they are capable of making a completely pure intention, They will be sustained by the buddha's kindness. The Angulimala says, The exposing of tathagatagarbha can be done by anyone, whether he be with affliction or without affliction; whoever succeeds is known as a \"com-plete buddha\".

Son of the family who wishes for the holy dharma, those who have done countless evil deeds will be cured of brain disease, contagion, pain, and denigration. And, If there is trust that the tathagata has the item of permanence, that person becomes extremely rare, like the U~umbara flower.-After my nirval)a, if someone hears this extremely profound siitra sec-tion of the Great Vehicle, then arouses the mind of faith, it should be known that he will, in future 33"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"34 INSTRUCfiONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS times, for one hundred thousand kalpas not fall into bad migrations.

Therefore, the experts who have compassion should teach it even at the cost of giving up their own lives, and so on. And those who seek emancipation should seek it and prostrate to and listen to it, even if it comes from a great pit of fire.

The object outside the reach of concept is wisdom, which is the final teaching of the Buddha and the aim of Other Emptiness practice. 14. This is a siitra of the third turning which is frequendy used as a scriptural support for the Other Emptiness view. 15. Not everyone agrees that the division of the turnings of the wheel into provisional and definitive meaning which the author has just given is correct. Therefore, he gives the two main kinds of validation (Skt. pramal).a) which show it to be correct: authentic statement and direct perception. For the first, there are a number of third turning siitras in which the conqueror and his sons state that this is the intended mean-ing-it is hard to think of condemning that, because it is authoritative statement of the Buddha and his bodhisatva sons. Secondly, in practice, the profound meaning does become increasingly clear to a person in the sequence shown until finally the whole meaning is understood in direct per-ception, which is regarded as the best kind of validation. 16. For fictional and superfactual, see the glossary. Fictional and superfactual here are defined as appearance and empti-ness respectively. There are other ways to define them which are important to the Other Emptiness view; for an explana-tion of this point see The Lion's Roar that Proclaims Zhantong. 17. Shantipa refers to Shantira~hita who came to Tibet in Padmasabhava's time, one of the great exponents of the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"44 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS Yogachara Middle Way view and a mainstay of what became called in Tibet, the Zhantong view. The others refers to the others of the time in India, such as Maitripa, who held the same VIew. 18. \"Middle and final wheels\" are the names commonly used in Buddhist literature to refer to the second and third turn-ings, respectively, of the wheel of dharma. 19. Nagarjuna championed teachings which emphasized the second turning of the wheel as ultimate and Asa:tiga champi-oned ones which emphasized the third turning as ultimate. Their teachings developed into the two main systems of teaching on emptiness that came into Tibet. 20. \"Fathers and sons\" means the gurus and disciples of a lineage, so here it is the gurus and disciples ofNagarjuna and Asa:tiga. 21. The Illuminator Tibetan-English Dictionary gives: \"The two, translators Zu and Tsan, were individuals of the late 1Oth and early 11th centuries C.E. who became important figures in the lineage of the profound meaning teachings coming from Maitreya and Asa:tiga. Zu was a student of Maitripa who stayed with him for many years and heard all of his teachings on Maitreya's texts. Tsan was a Chinese Buddhist who came down to India shordy before his death looking for a special teaching.

The mid-1800's. After this, the writer Jamgon Kongtrul, and his subsequent incarnations became mainstays of the system and their followers such as Khenpo Tsultrim Gyatso in recent times, likewise. 23. \"The Seventh Lord\" is Karmapa Chodrag Gyatso, who explained the Zhantong system in his Ocean ofTexts on Reason-ing and Pramarta as follows. Regarding the self-empty system, the view of the middle turning, it is said that, if it is first realized that all appearing phenomena are lacking existence by way of self entity, which is a coarse approach using the coarse phenomena of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches that is easy for a beginner, then from that coarse determination one can enter what is more subtle, mind's actuality. Then, in the other-empty system, the root of all phenomena is mind, so if the actuality of mind is determined principally in relation to mind, then, having already under-stood the emptiness of coarse phenomena-that sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches are not truly existent-which is easy to realize, the actuality itself becomes expanse-knowing (expanse-rigpa) inseparable in the entity of the actuality. 24.

There have also been a number of other great masters-the seventh Karmapa, Zilung Pal).chen, Taranatha oftheJonang school, and the eighth Situ Panchen Tenpa'i Nyinje-who were noble beings with the validating eye of direct perception of wisdom whose works were in favour of this system. 26. All history aside, anyone who practises the Buddha's teaching and arrives at a correct view of reality will arrive at the view of this system-there is simply no other possibility. Saying so is not polemic; when everything is understood, this is the ultimate teaching of the siitras. 2 7. Marpa Lotsawa, Tibetan founder of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition called the Kagyu. 28. What is grasped is the external objects of a dualistic consciousness-see grasped-grasping in the glossary. 29. Individualized beings are the ordinary beings of sarp.sara; they have cut themselves off into an individualized existence. 30. These are those who advocate the second turning of the wheel with its emphasis on negation of dharmas as the place where the Buddha taught the ultimate teaching of emptiness. They use the reasonings: 1) The Vajra Slivers; 2) Existence and Non-existence in Production and Cessation; 3) Four limits of production and cessation; 4) Great Dependent Relationship; 5) Freeing From One and Many. 31. The previous sentence shows the view with two aspects-emptiness and appearance-arrived at intellectually through contemplation. This sentence shows the actual view which"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"ENDNOTES 47 one settles into during the actual practice of meditation. 32. This is also known as individually discriminating prajfiii but the point is being made that, even though it is correctly operating mind, it is still dualistic mind. 3 3. See the note on \"mind\" in the glossary. 34. Skt. manaskiira, Tib. yid la mi byed pa. Mentation is an important term in discussions of meditation on emptiness. It could mean that there is no mentation but in this case it means that the whole process of mind is gone and therefore there is none of the usual activity in which mentation itself is actively stirred up. 35. For foremost instruction, see the glossary. 3 6. The previous sentences concerned the understanding and meditation on emptiness of the second turning of the wheel. Once that has been realized, a practitioner can continue on to gain realization of the emptiness taught in the third turning of the wheel. This view is not developed with intellectual process as is the case with the previous step, but is communi-cated directly using authentic statement and foremost oral instruction as the means of giving an introduction to the realization in direct perception. This use of introduction based on foremost instruction is usually considered to be a feature only of the Vajra Vehicle. It shows that the instruc-tions for the Other Emptiness practice are a secret type of instruction which corresponds to the innermost teachings of the Vajra Vehicle."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"48 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS 37. By the Indian master Acharya Bodhibhadra, this text explains what must be bought together (the meaning of accumulations in the title) in order to develop a good one-pointedness of mind. 38. For dharmatii, see the glossary. 39. What has just been described is how it actually is. Still, and as it says in the quotation given, it is possible to be mis-taken over this. The followers of the Gelugpa school histori-cally have made exactly that mistake. They were renowned for their insistence on the use of intellect, with its two generic mental events called examination (Tib. rtog pa) and analysis (Tib. dpyod pa), to find emptiness and then their insistence that the very subtle concept of emptiness achieved through that was the dharmatii, that is, reality seen in direct percep-tion. They were very conceited about their approach and were known for proclaiming that they were the only ones in Tibet who understood emptiness as taught by the Buddha. They were regarded by others, such as the Kagyu, Nyingmas, and J onangs, as having lost the true path of the Middle Way. 40. Now the author moves on 1D people who are following the tantric path. They have the instructions on Mahiimudrii practice but do not know how to liberate according to the instructions. Therefore, they find themselves in a meditative state in which concepts, with their attendant birth and cessa-tion, are still being used. They believe this to be Mahiimudrii but in fact it has not transcended saxpsiira; it is still a concep-tually enumerated understanding of the dharmatii."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"ENDNOTES 49 41. \"Attribute analysis\" is one of a pair of terms used to specify the type of mind doing an analysis. Attribute analysis is done using the names or labels which are conceptual constructs, so never exceeds the scope of rational mind. Therefore, even those both of these groups definitely have analysis for emptiness in their meditation, it is a conceptual type and they never get to liberation because of it. The other type of analysis, called \"overall analysis\", refers to direct knowledge through wisdom. 42. Everyone will agree that correct instructions for practice are needed and that they will produce wisdom when applied. However, to get to the all-knowing wisdom of a buddha, the instruction must be the one above all others which is consis-tent with actual exit from samsaric existence. 43.

The Other Emptiness teaching mainly speak of sugatagarbha because of emphasising that one really could achieve buddhahood by practising this view. Adding \"dharmatii\" to indicates that it is the wisdom mind seeing reality. 50. For luminosity, see the glossary. 51. There are individually discriminating prajfiii, which is what is used to see emptiness in the approach of the second turning of the wheel, and there is individual self-knowing wisdom, which is what is used to see the actual dharmatii of reality in the approach of the third turning of the wheel. The two are not the same. The word individually in the first means one by one-each phenomenon known individually by prajfiii. The word individual in the second means that every being does possess self-knowing wisdom. 52. This is the progression taught in the Highest Continuum. 53. For appropriation, see the glossary. Appropriation hap-pens based primarily on karma and affliction which in turn happen based on ignorance of reality as it is. 54. Samsaric beings do not stay within the sphere of their own complete purity, wisdom, but have corrupt discharges of ignorance which keep them cycling in the sphere of cyclic existence.

The ordinary preliminaries in them are the four contemplations of Precious Human Birth, Imperma-nence and Death, Karmic Cause and Effect, and Disadvan-tages of Cyclic Existence. 57. \"Virtuous sugatagarbha\" is the original dharma term which Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche famously translated as \"basic goodness\".

Now, instead of taking as the reference point for practice something which is close to reality but not quite it, one moves to taking a reference point of the authentic itself and goes on from there.

Therefore, even though it i~ often tr~si~ted as \"sudden\", that only cqnveys half of the meaning. In ·Buddhist literature, something adventitious comes up as a surface event and disappears again precisely because it is·not actually part of the thing on whose surface it appeared. It is frequently used in relation to the afflictions because they pop up a'n the surface of the mind of buddha nature but are not part of. the buddh~ nature itself, which ~s one of the k~y points. of Other Emptiness _theory."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"66 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS Affliction, Skt. klesha, Tib. nyon mongs: This term is usually translated as emotion or disturbing emotion, etcetera but Buddha was very specific about the meaning of this word. When the Buddha referred to the emotions, meaning a movement of mind, he did not refer to them as such but cal-led them \"klesha\" in Sanskrit, meaning exactly \"affliction\". It is a basic part of the Buddhist teaching that emotions afflict beings, giving them problems at the time and causing more problems in the future. Alaya, Tib. kun gzhi: This term, if translated, is usually translated as all-base or thereabouts. It is a Sanskrit term that means a range that underlies and forms a basis for something else. In Buddhist teaching, it means a particular level of mind that sits beneath all other levels of mind. However, it is used in several different ways in the Buddhist teaching and changes to a different meaning in each case. Alertness, Tib. shes bzhin: Alertness is a specific mental event that occurs in dualistic mind. It and another mental event, mind-fulness, are the two functions of mind that must be developed in order to develop shamatha or one-pointedness of mind. In that context, mindfulness is what remembers the object of the concentration and holds the mind to it while alertness is the . mind watching the situation to ensure that the mindfulness is not lost. If distraction does occur, alertness will know it and will inform the mind to re-establish mindfulness again. All-Knowing, Tib. kun mkhyen: Every century in Tibet, there were just a few people who seemed to know everything, they were given the title \"All:-Knowing\". Note that \"All-Knowing\" does not mean \"omniscient one\" even though it is, unfortu-nately, often translated that way.

It is the crucial point in the process at which a"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY 67 karma that has been previously planted is selected and acti-vated as ~e karma that will propel the being of the time into its next existence. In other words, it is the key point in a being's existence when the next type of existence is selected. Authentic statement, Skt.agama, Tib l~g. Although often trans-lated as \"scripture\", authentic statement means statement made by someone who has the true knowledge needed to make fully reliable statements about a subject. It is oft~n l1Sed · to indicate dharma taught by the Buddha or his :disciples which is authoritative because of its source. It is also·used in the pair \"authoritative statement and realization\" which, the· Buddha explained, summed up the ways of transmitting his reaiization. . Becoming, Skt. bhavana, Tib. srid pa: Becoming refers to the style of existence that sentient beings have within samsara. :f3eings in samsara have a samsaric existence but, more than that, they are conStantly in a state of becoming. They are constantly becoming this type of being or that type of being in this abode or that, as they are driven along without choice by the karmic process that drives samsaric existence. Bodhisatua, Tib. byang chub sems dpa': A bodhisatva is a person who has engendered the bodhichitta, enlightenment mind, and, with that as a basis, has undertaken the path to the en-lightenment of a truly complete· buddha specifically for the welfare of other beings. Note that, despite tb;e common ·appearance of\"bodhisattva\" in Western books on Buddhism, the Tibetan tradition has steadfastly maintained since the time of the earliest translations that the correct spelling is bodhisatva. Clinging, Tib. zhen pa: In Buddhism, this term refers specifically to the twofold process of dualistic mind mis-:-taking things that are not true, not pure, as tnie, pUre, etcetera ari.d, ~en, because of seeing them as highly desirable even though they"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"68 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS are not, attaching itself to or clinging to those things. This type of clinging acts as a kind of glue that keeps you with the unsatisfactory things of cyclic existence because of mistakenly seeing them as desirable. Complete purJty, rnam dag: This term refers to the quality of a buddha's mind, which is completely pure compared to a sentient being's mind. The mind of a being in samsara has its primordially pure nature covered over by the muck of dualis-tic mind. If the being practises correctly, the impurity can be I removed and mind can be returned to its original state Of complete purity. Confusion, Tib. 'khrul pa: In Buddhism, this term mostly refers to the fundamental confusion of taking things the wrong way that happens because of fundamental ignorance though it can also have the more general meaning of having lots of thoughts and 'being confused about it. In the first case, it is defined like this, \"Confusion is the appearance to rational n;llnd of something being present when it is not\", and refers for example to seeing an object, such as a table, as being truly present when in fact it is present only as mere, interdepen-dent appearance. Cyclic existence, Skt. sarp.sara, Tib. 'khor ba: The type of existence that sentient beings have which is that they continue on from one existence to another, always within the enclosure of births that are produced by ignorance and experienced as unsatisfactory. Although the Tibetan term literally means \"cycling\", the original Sanskrit has a slightly different mean-ing; it means to go about, here and there. Dharmakaya, Skt. dharmakaya, Tib. chos sku: In general, this refers to the mind of a buddha, with dharma meaning reality and kaya meaning body. However, the term has special significance· in the practice of Great Completion where it is"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY 69 the·means by which one rapidly imposes liberation on oneself. Dharmata, Skt. dharmata, \"rib. chos nyid: This is a general term meaning the way that something is, and can be applied to anything at all; it is siniilar in meaning to \"actuality'' q.v. For example, the dharma~ of water is wetness and the dharmata of the becoming bardo is a place where beings are in a sam-saric, or becoming mode, prior to entering a nature bardo. It is used frequently in Tibetan Buddhism to mean \"the dharinata of reality'' but that is a specific case of the much larger meaning of the term. To read texts which use this term successfully, one has to understand that the term has a general meaning and then see how that applies in context. Dharmin, Tib. chos can: Generally speaking a dharniin is a con-ceived-of phenomenon, so by implication belongs to the world of saxp.sara. It is not only a phenomenon in gencrral, a dharma, but has become a conceptualized phenomenon because of the samsaric context. Padma.Karpo defines it as \"awareness possessing a phenomenon\" which puts the em-phasis on the samsaric awareness knowing the phenomenon. Discursiue thought, Skt. vikalpita, Tib. r~am rtog: This means more than just the 511perficial thought that is heard as a voice in the head. It includes the entirety of conceptual process that arises due to mind contacting any object of any of the senses. The Sanskrit and Tibetan literally mean \"(dualistic) thought (that arises from the mind wandering among _the) various (superficies perceived in the doors of the senses)\". Elaboration; Tib. spro ba: a general name for what is given off by . dualistic mind as it goes about its conceptual process. In general, elaborations prevent a person from seeing emptiness directly.

Emptiness hauing the excellence of all superficies, Tib. rnam kun mchog ldan gyi stong pa nyid: This term is taught in the"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"70 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS Kalachakra Tantra to emphasize the fact that emptiness is always unified with appearance. The tantra teaches, in con-junction with this-term, that emptiness always has the excel-lence of all superficies, that is, always has the fullness of appearance with it. The name is employed in philosophical writings to imply that emptiness is never the bare kind of emptiness that can come from mistakenly understanding the PrajfUiparamita teachings on emptiness. The term is usually mistakenly translated as \"emptiness endowed. with the supreme of all aspects\" because of mistak-ing the Tibetan term \"mchog\" to mean the buddha qualities. However, the translation as given is the correct understand-ing of the term, an understanding which is standard through-out Tibetan literature. Furthermore, grammatically speak-ing, this is emptiness which is not \"endowed with\" anything but simply \"has\" or \"possesses\" something. Enlightenment mind, Skt. bodhicitta, Tib. byang chub sems: A key term of the Great Vehicle. It is the type of mind that is connected not with the lesser enlightenment of an arhat but the enlightenment of a truly complete buddha. As such, it is a mind that is connected with the aim of bringing all sentient beings to that same level ofbuddhahood. A person who has this mind has entered the Great Vehicle and is either a bodhisatva or a buddha. It is important to understand that the term is used to refer equally to the minds of all levels ofbodhisatva on the path to buddhahood and to the mind of a buddha who has completed the path. Therefore, it is not \"mind striving for enlighten-ment\" as is so often translated, but \"enlightenment mind\", that kind of mind which is connected with the full enlighten-ment of a truly complete buddha and which is present in all those who belong to the Great Vehicle. The term is used in the conventional Great Vehicle and also in the Vajra Vehicle. In the Vajra Vehicle, there are some special uses of the term"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY 71 where substances of the pure aspect of the subtle physical ·body are understood to be manifestations of enlightenment mind~ Entity, Tib. ngo bo: The entity of something is just exactly what that thing is. In English we would often simply say \"thing\" rather than entity but there is the problem that, in Buddhism, \"thing\" has a very specific meaning and not the general meaning that it has in English. Equipoise ~nd post-attainment, Tib. mnyam bzhag and rjes thob: Although often called \"meditation and post-meditation\", the actual term is \"equipoise and post-attainment\". There is great meaning in the actual wording which is lost by the looser translation. Fictional, Skt. sarp.vrti, Tib. kun rdzob: This term is paired with the term \"superfactual\" q.v. Until now these two terms·have been translated as \"relative\" and \"absolute\" but the transla-tions are nothing like the original terms. These terms are extremely important in the Buddhist teaching so it is very important that they be corrected but more than that, if the actual meaning of these terms is not presented, then the teaching connected with them cannot be understood. The Sanskrit term sarp.vrti means a deliberate invention, ·a fiction, a hoax. It refers to the mind of ignorance which, because of being obscured and so not seeing suchness, is not true but a fiction. The things that appear to the ignorance are therefore fictional. Nonetheless, the beings who live in this ignorance believe that the things that appear to them through the filter of ignorance are true, are real. Therefore, these beings live in fictional truth. Fictional truth, Skt. sarp.vrtisatya, Tib. kun rdzob bden pa: See under \"Fictional\" for an explanation of this term. Field, Field realm, Tib. zhing, zhing khams: This term is often translated \"buddha field\" though there is no \"buddha\" in the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"72 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS term. There are many different types of \"fields\" both in sarpsara and in nirvat).a. Thus there are fields that belong to enlightenment and ones that belong to igD;orance.

Foremost instruction, Skt. upade5ha, Tib. man ngag: there are several types of instruction mentioned in Buddhist literature: there is the general level of instruction which is the meaning contained in the words of the texts of the tradition; on a more personal and direct level there is oral instruction which has been passed down from teacher to student from the time of the buddha; and on the most profound level there is upade5ha which are not only oral instructions provided by one's guru but are special, core instructions that come out of personal experience and which convey the teaching concisely and with the full weight of personal experience. Upade5ha are crucial to the Other Emptiness and Vajra Vehicle systems because these are the specia~ way of passing on the profound instruc-tions needed for the disciple's realization. Great Vehicle, Skt. mahayana, Tib. theg pa chen po: The Buddha's teachings as a whole can be summed up into three vehicles where a vehicle is defined as that which can carry you to a certain destination. The first vehicle, called the Lesser Vehi-cle, contains the teachings designed to get an individual moving on the spiritual path through showing the unsatisfac-tory state of cyclic existence and an emancipation from that. However, that path is only concerned with personal emanci-pation and fails to take account of all of the beings that there are in existence. There used to be eighteen schools of Lesser Vehicle in India but the only one surviving these days is the Theravada of south-east Asia. The Greater Vehicle is a step up from that. The Buddha explained that it was great in"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY 73 comparison to the Lesser Vehicle for seven reasons. The first of those is that it is concerned with attaining the ~y com-plete enlightenment of a truly complete buddha for the sake of every sentient being where the Lesser Vehicle is concerned only with a personal liberation that is not truly complete eiilightenment and which is achieved only for the sake of that practitioner. The Great Vehicle has two divisions. There is a conventional Great Vehicle in which the path is taught in a logical, conventional way. There is also an unconventional Great Vehicle in which the path is taught in an unconven-tional and very direct way. This latter vehicle is called the Vajra Vehicle because it takes the innermost, indestructible (vajra) fact of reality of one's own mind as the vehicle to enlightenment. Ground, Tib. gzhi: This is the first member of the formulation of ground, path, and fruition. Ground, path, and fruition is the way that the teachings of the path of oral instruction are presented to students. Ground refers to the basic situation as it is. Intent, Tib. dgongs pa: The honorific term for the way that something is understood or for a mind that has a certain un-derstanding. Introduction and To Introduce, Tib. ngos sprad and ngos sprod pa respectively: This pair of terms is usually translated in the U.S.A. these days as \"pointing out\" \"and \"to point out\" but this is a mistake that has, unfortunately, become entrenched. The terms are the standard terms used in day to day life for the situation in which one person introduces another person to someone or something. They are the exact same words as our English \"introduction\" and \"to introduce\". In the Vajra Vehicle, these terms are specifically used for the situation in which one person introduces another person to the nature of his own mind. Now there is a term in Tibetan"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"74 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS for \"pointing out\" but that term is never used for this purpose because in this case no-one points out anything. Rather, a person is introduc.ed by another person to a part of himself that he has forgotten about. Kagyu, Tib. bka' brgyud: There are four main schools of Bud-dhism in Tibet-Nyingma, Kagyli, Sakya, and Gelug. Nyingma is the oldest school dating from about 800 C.E. Kagyu and Sakya 'both appeared in the 12th century C.E. Each of these three schools came directly from India. The Gelug school came later and did not come directly from India but came from the other three. The Nyingma school holds the tantric teachings called Great Completion (Dzogchen); the other three schools hold the tantric teachings called Mahamudra. Kayas and wisdoms, Tib. sku dang ye shes: Enlightened being might be empty of samsaric phenomena but it does have en-lightened content. \"Kayas and wisdoms\" or \"bodies and wisdoms\" is a stock phrase used to indicate either the content of enlightenment or to imply that it does have content. Latency, Skt. vasana, Tib. bag chags: The original Sanskrit has the meaning exactly of \"latency''. The Tibetan term translates that inexactly with \"something sitting there (Tib. chags) within the environment of mind (Tib. bag)\". Although it has become popular to translate this term into English with \"habitual pattern\", that is not its meaning. The term refers to a karmic seed that has been imprinted on the mindstream and is present there as a latency, ready and waiting to come into manifestation. Lesser Vehicle, Skt. hmayana, Tib. theg pa dman pa: See under Great Vehicle. Luminosity, Skt. prabhasvara, Tib. 'od gsal ba: the core of mind, called mind's essence, has two aspects, parts, or factors as they are called. One is emptiness and the other is knowing."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY 75 Luminosity is a metaphor for the fundamental !mowing qua-lity of the essence of mind. It is sometimes translated as \"clear light'' but that is a mistake that comes from not under-standing how the words of the Sanskrit and the Tibetan,, too, go together. It does not refer to a light that has the quality of clearness (something that makes no sense, actually!) but refers to the illuminative property which is the hallmark of mind. Mind lmows, that is what it does. Metaphorically, it is a luminosity that illuminates itS own content. In both Sanskrit and Tibetan Buddhist literature, the term is fre-quendy abbreviated just to gsal ba, \"clarity\", with the same meaning. Mind, Skt. chitta, Tib. sems: the complicated process of mind which occurs because then; is ignorance. J'his sort of mind is a samsaric phenomenon .. It is a dualistic mind. Mindness, Skt. chittata, Tib. sems nyid. Mindness is a specific term of the tantras. It is one of many terms meaning the essence of mind or the nature of mind. It conveys the sense of \"what mind is at its very core\". It has sometimes been translated as \"mind itself\" but that is a misunderstanding of the Tibetan word \"nyid\". The term does not mean \"that ·thing mind\" where mind refers to dualistic mind. Rather, it means the very core of dualistic mind, what min4 is at root, without all of the dualistic baggage. Mindness is a path term. It refers to exacdy the same thing as \"actuality'' or \"actuality of mind\" which is a ground term but does so from the practitioner's perspective. It conveys the sense to a practitioner that he might still have baggage of dualistic mind that has not been purified yet but i:here is a core to that mind that he can work with. Noble one, Skt. arya, Tib. 'phags pa: In Buddhism, a noble one is a being who. has become spiritually advanced to the point that he has passed beyond cyclic existence. According to the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"76 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS Buddha, the beings in cyclic existence were ordinary beings, spiritual commoners, and the beings who had passed beyond it were special, th~ nobility. Non-regressing, Tib. phyir mi ldogs pa: This is a standard term used to describe the ultimate teachings on emptiness of the third turning of the wheel of dharma, called Other Empti-ness. When a person has heard and comprehended these teachings, he immediately understands that all other teach-ings of the second and third turnings of the wheel are not ultimate and assumes the position that he will never turn back from these teachings and regress to taking one of the lesser views as ultimate. Outflow, Skt. sasrava, Tib. zag pa: Outflows occur when wisdom loses its footing and falls into the elaborations of dualistic mind. Therefore, anything with duality also has outflows. This is sometimes translated as \"defiled\" or \"conditioned\" but these fail to capture the meaning. The idea is that wis-dom can remain self-contained in its own unique sphere but, when it loses its ability to stay within itself, it starts to have leakages into dualism that are defilements on the wisdom. See also un-outflowed. Post-attainment, Tib. rjes thob: See under equipoise and post-attainment. Prajna, Skt. prajfia, Tib. shes rab: A San~krit term for the type of mind that makes good and precise distinctions between this and that and hence which arrives at correct understanding. It has been translated as \"wisdom\" but that is not correct because it is, generally speaking, a mental event belonging to dualistic [\\lind where \"wisdom\" is used to refer to the non-dualistic knower of a buddha .. Moreover, the main feature of prajfia is its ability to distinguish correctly between one thing and another and hence to arrive at a correct understanding."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY 77 Preserue, Tib. skyong ba: In general, this term means to defend, protect, nurtl.ire, maintain. In explanations of meditation, it means to keep something just as it is, to.nurture that some-thing so that it stays and is not lost. Prouisional and definitiue meaning, Skt. neyartha and nitartha, Tib. drangs don and nges don: This is a pair ofterms used to distinguish which is an ultimate or final teaching and which is not. A teaching which guides a student along to a certain understanding where the understanding led to is not an ulti-mate understanding is called \"provisional meaning\". The teaching is not false even though it does not show the final meaning; it is a technique of skilful means used to lead a stu-dent in steps to the final meaning. A teaching which shows a student the final meaning directly is called \"definitive meaning\". The understanding presented cannot be refined or shown in a more precise way; it is the final and'actual understanding to be understood. These terms are most often used in Buddhism when discussing the status of the three turnings of the wheel of dharma. Rational mind, Tib. blo: The Kagyu, Nyingma, anclJonang tradi-tions use this term pejoratively for the most part, using it to mean dualistic mind. It is the villain, so to speak, which needs to be removed from the equation in order to obtain enlightenment. This term is commonly ·translated simply as mind but that causes confusion with the many otlier words that are also translated simply as mind. It is not just another mind but is specifically the sort of mind that creates the situation of this and that (ratio in Latin) and hence upholds the duality of saq1sara. It is the very opposite of the essence of mind. Thus, this is a key term which should be noted and not just glossed over as \"mind\". Rigpa, Tib. rig pa: Rigpa literally means to lmow in the sense of \"I see!\" It is used at all levels of meaning from the coarsest everyday sense of !mowing something to the deepest sense of"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":".78 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS knowing something as presented in the teachings on wisdom. To translate it as \"awareness\" which is coronion practice these days is a poor practice; there are many kinds of aware-ness but there is only one rigpa and besides, rigpa is substan-tially more than just awareness. Since this is such an impor-tant term and since it lacks an equivalent in English, I choose not to translate it. However, it will be helpful in reading the teXt: to u.nderstanding the meaning as just given. This is the term used to indicate enlightened mind as 'experi-enced by the practitioner on the path of these practices. The term itself specifically refers to the dynamic knowing quality of mind. It absolutely does not mean a simple registering, as implied by the word \"awareness\" which unfortunately is often used to translate this term. There is no word in English that exactly matches it, though the idea of\"seeing\" or \"insight on the spot\" is very close. Proof of this is found in the fact that the original Sanskrit term \"vidya\" is actually the root of all words in English that start with \"vid\" and mean \"to see\", for example, \"video\", \"vision\", and so on. Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, who was particular skilled at getting Tibetan words into English, also s~ted that this term rigpa really did not have a good equivalent in English, though he thought that \"insight\" was the closest. My own conclusion after hearing extensive teaching on it is that rigpa is just best left untranslated. Shamatha, Skt. shamatha, Tib. gzhi gnas: The name of one of the two main practices of meditation used in the Buddhist system to gain insight into reality. This practice creates a foundation of one-pointedness of mind which can then be used to focus the insight of the other practice, vipashyana. If the develop-ment of shamatha is taken through to completion, the result is a mind that sits stably on its object without any effort and a body which is filled with ease. Altogether, this result of the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY 79 practice is called \"the creation of workability of body and mind\". State, Tib. ngang: A state is a certain, ongoing situation. In Buddhist meditation in general, there are various states that a practitioner has to enter and remain in as part of developing the meditation. Sugatagarbha, Tib. bde war gshegs pa'i snying po: A Sanskrit term literally meaning \"the birthplace of those who go to bliss\" and used as a name for the buddha nature. The buddha nature is the potential that we all have which allows us to go to the state of enlightenment, the blissful state beyond all the unsatisfactoriness of normal existence. Sugatagarbha has the same basic meaning as tathagatagarbha though its use indi-cates a more practical way of talking whereas tathagatagarbha is more theoretical. A discussion which uses the terril suga-tagarbha is one that is talking about the practical realities of an essence that can be or is being developed into enlightened being. . Superfactual, Skt. paramartha,Tib. don dam: This term is paired with the term \"fictional\" q.v. Until now these two terms have been translated as \"relative\" and \"absolute\" but those transla-tions are nothing like the original terms. These terms are extremely important in the Buddhist teaching so it is very important that their translations be corrected but, more than that, if the actual meaning of these terms is not presented, the teaching connected with them cannot be understood. The Sanskrit term paramartha literally means \"a superior or holy kind of fact\" and refers to the wisdom mind possessed by those who have developed themselves spiritually to the point of having transcended Salllsara. That wisdom is superior to an ordinary, un-developed person's consciousness and the facts that appear on its surface are superior compared to the facts that appear on the ordinary person's consciousness. There-"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"80 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS fore, it is superfact or the holy fact, more literally. What this wisdom sees is true for the beings who have it, therefore what the wisdom sees is-superfactual truth. Superfactual truth, Skt. paramarthasatya, Tib. don dam bden pa: See under \"Superfactual\" for an explanation of this term. Superfice, superficies, Tib. mam pa: in discussions of mind, a distiliction is made between the entity of mind which is a mere !mower and the superficial things that appear on its surface and which are lmown by it. In other words, the su-perficies are the various things which pass over the surface of mind but which are not mind. Superficies are all the specifics that constitute· appearance, for example, the colour white within a moment of visual consciousness, the sound he~d within an ear consciousness, and so on. Suppression and furtherance, Tib. dgag sgrub: Suppression and furtherance is the term used to express the way that dualistic mind approaches the path to enlightenment. In that case, some states of mind are regarded as ones to be discarded, so the practitioner takes the approach of attempting to suppress or stop them, ·and some are regarded as ones to be developed, so the practitioner takes the approach of trying to go further with and develop them. These two poles represent the way that dualistic mind always works with itself. Tathagatagarbha, Skt. tathagatagarbha, Tib. de bzhin gshegs pa'i snying po: See under sugatagarbha. Temporary experience, Tib. nyams: The practice of meditation brings with it various experi~nces that happen simply because of the meditation. These experiences are temporary experi-ences and not the final, unchanging experience, of realization. The nature, Tib. rang bzhin: The nature is one of the three char-acteristics-entity, nature, and un-stopped compassionate activity-of the core.of mind. Using this term emphasizes that the empty entity does have a nature. In other words, its"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY 81 use explicitly shows that the core of mind is not merely empty. If you ask \"Well, what is that nature like?\" The answer is that it is luminosity, it is wisdom. Unaltered or uncontriued, Tib. rna bcos pa: The opposite of \"altered\" and \"contrived\". Something which has not been altered. from its native state; something which has been left just as it is. Un-outflowed, Skt. asrava, Tib. zag pa nied pa: See also \"outflow-ed\". Un-outflowed dharmas are ones that are connected with wisdom that has not lost its footing and leaked out into a defiled state; it is self-contained wisdom without any taint of dualistic mind and its apparatus. Un-stopped, Tib. rna 'gags pa: An important path term in the teaching of both Mahamudra and Great Completion. The essence of mind has two parts: ·emptiness and luminosity. Both of these must come unified. However, when a practitio-ner does the practice, he will fall into one extreme or the other and ~at is called \"stoppage\". The aim of the practice is to get to the stage in which there is both emptiness and. luminosity together. In that case, there is no stoppage of falling into one extreme or the other. Thus non-stopped luminosity is a term that indicates that there is the luminosity with all of its appearance yet that luminosity, for the practi-tiqner,.is not mistaken, is not stopped off. Stopped luminos..: ity is an experience like luminosity but in which the appear~ ances have, at least to some . extent, not been mixed with emptiness. Upadesha, Tib. man ngag: See the glossary entry \"Foremost Instruction\". Vajra Vehicle, Skt. vajrayana, Tib. rdo rje'i theg pa: See under \"Great Vehicle\". View, meditation, and conduct, Tib. lta sgom spyod: A formulation of the teachings that contains all of the meaning of the path."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"82 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS Vipashyana, Tib. lhag mthong: The Sanskrit name for one ~f the two main practices of meditation neede~ in the. Buddhist system for gaining insight into reality. The other one, shamatha~ keeps the mind focussed w~e this one, vipa5hya-na, looks piercingly into the nawre of things. Wisdom, Sk.t. jiiana, Tib. ye shes: This is a fruition term that refers to the kind of mind, the kind of knower possessed by a buddha. Sentient beings do have this ki.t:ld ofknower but it is covered over by a very complex apparatus for knowing, dualistic mind. If they practise the path to buddhahood, they will leave behind their obscuration and return to having this kind of knower. The original Sanskrit term has the sense of knowing in the most simple and immediate way. This sort of knowing is present at the_ core of every being's mind. Therefore, the Tibetans ~alled it \"the particular type of awareness which is there primordially\". Because of their wording, it is often c~lled \"primordial wisdom\" in English translations but that is too much. It is just wisdom in the sense of the most funda-mental knowing possible. ·"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"SUPPORTS FOR STUDY I have been encouraged over the years by all of my teachers to pass on the knowledge I have accumulated in a lifetime dedicated. to study and practice, primarily in the Tibetan tradition of Buddhism. On the one hand, they have encour.:. aged me to teach. On the other, they are concerned that, while many general books on Buddhism have been and are being published, there are few books that present the actual texts of the tradition. Ther~fore they, together with a num-ber of major figures in the Buddhist book publishing world, have also encouraged me to translate and publish high quality translations of individual.texts of the tradition. My teachers always remark with great appreciation on the extraordinary amount of teaching that I have heard. in this life. It allows for highly informed, accurate translations of a sort not us1:1ally seen. Briefly, I spent the 1970'·s studying, practising, then teaching the Gelugpa system at Chenrezig Institute, Australia, where I was· a founding member and also the first Australian to be ordained as a monk in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. In 1980, I moved to the United States to study at the feet of the Vidyadhara Chogyam Trungpa:Rinpo-83"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"84 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER EMPTINESS che. I stayed in his Vajradhatu community, now called Sham-bhala, where I studied and practised all the Karma Kagyu, Nyingma, and Sl'\\anibhala teachings being presented there and was a senior member of the Nalanda Translation Com-mittee. After the vidyadhara's nirvana, I moved in 1992 to Nepal, where I have been continuously involved with the study, practise, translation, and teaching of the K.agyu system and especially of the Nyingma system of Great Completion. In recent years, I have spent extended times in Tibet with the greatest living Tibetan masters of Great Completion, receiv-ing very pure transmissions of the ultimate levels of this teaching direcdy in Tibetan and practising them there in retreat. In that way, I have studied and practised extensively not in one Tibetan tradition as is usually done, but in three of the four Tibetan ·traditions-Gelug, K.agyu, and Nyingma-and also in the Theravada tradition, too. With that as a basis, I have taken a comprehensive and long term approach to the work of translation. For any language, one first must have the lettering needed to write the language. Therefore, as a member of the Nalanda Translation Commit-tee~ I spent some years in the 1980's making Tibetan word-processing software and high-quality Tibetan fonts. After that, reliable lexical works are needed. Therefore, during the 1990's I spent some years writing the Illuminator Tibetan-English Dictionary and a set of treatises on Tibetan grammar, preparing a variety of key Tibetan reference works needed for the study and translation of Tibetan Buddhist texts, and giving our Tibetan software the tools needed to translate and research Tibetan texts.

The committee focusses on producing books containing the best of Tibetan literature, and, especially, books that meet the needs of practitioners.

profound view taught by the Buddha. It is the very basis of the teaching of the majority offiberan Buddhi t schools, though has been overwhelmed by some reactive Tibetan Buddhi t schools who have argued against it. As a result, it has not been well understood in the West, where ir is often thought of as a complicated philosophical view enshrouded in argument. In fact, Other Emptiness is the penultimate teaching of the sutras and the root of all ranrras. This book unequivocally shows that the Buddha did not teach this uJrimare of views as a complicated philosophy for scholarly • rgument but as a practical view ro be used for the :mainment of enlightenment. 11le author has received extensive explanations on the Middle Way view during nearly forty years of do e association with eminent teachers of all four 'f1betan Buddhist schools, so has an unusually clear and comprehensive undersmnding of the Other Emptiness view. He has recently written a series of books which show Ocher Emptiness from Kagyu, Nyingma, and Jonang perspectives. This book showcases an instruction manual for the actual practise of the Other Emptiness view. 'The manual was written by Jamgon Kongrrul. one of the grc:u masters of the Kagyu school. He wrote the manual after going to the throne-holder of rhe Jonang school, who gave him the entire Jonang transmission of Other Emptiness. 1his book has an extensive introduction which will go far towards clarifying Other Emptiness for scholars and practitioners alike. The introduction examines Other ·mptincss from many sides, so that even reader who are nor rechni lly inclined can understand it. For those who arc technically inclined, the rexr irself provides a wealrh of detail on how co develop the view and do the medication of Other Emptiness. Padma Karpo Translation Committee P.O.
