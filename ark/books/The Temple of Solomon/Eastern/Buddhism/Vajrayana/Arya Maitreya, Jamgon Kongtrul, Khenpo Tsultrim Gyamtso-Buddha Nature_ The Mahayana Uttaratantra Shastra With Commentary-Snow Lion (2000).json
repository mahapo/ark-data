This is the first time an En­glish translation of this commentary has been published. The book is the fruit of twenty years of study by Rosemarie Fuchs, a member of the Marpa Translation Committee and a devoted student of the very Venerable Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche.This commentary has been taught by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche to many Buddhist students around the world. In 1997, he taught it at the Rigpe Dorje winter program in Pullahari, Nepal, the main seat of His Eminence Jamgon Kongtriil Rinpoche. At the end of the teachings Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche gave the responsi­bility of finding ways to publish this commentary to the Jamgon Kongtrul Labrang, with his heartfelt wish that the activity of the Fourth Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, Lodro Chokyi Nyima, would flourish auspiciously.Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche has been the spiritual advisor of Pullahari since His Eminence the Third Jamgon Kongtrul passed away in April 1992, and has clearly fulfilled the Third Jamgon KongtriiTs wish in establishing Pullahari as a place for the study and practice of Buddhadharma.The Jamgon Kongtrul Labrang is profoundly grateful to Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, Rosemarie Fuchs, and Snow Lion"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Publications for making this teaching available to students and prac­titioners today and in the future.

It is the first translation of this par­ticular commentary into a Western language. Throughout Buddhist history, the words of the Buddha and the scriptures explaining their meaning were translated when they were imported into different cul­tures. Though the first translation was never a final or flawless one, it constituted a basis for better ones to come in the future. I hope that this present text may continue this tradition. As it has been created at the advice and under the guidance of a truly accomplished master, there should be some virtue in it, and I wish that it may be of utmost benefit to any reader.The introduction to Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche's commentary is not translated here, but can be found in S.K. Hookham's book The Buddha Within (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), pp. 263-288.I would like to express my deep gratitude to Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, Sangja Nyenpa Rinpoche, Ringu Tulku Rinpoche, Acharya Lama Tenpa Gyaltsen, the late Acharya Tenpa Gyaltsen Negi, and Burkhard Quessel for their kind and invaluable help in the transla­tion of passages that I found myself unable to do on my own. My further thanks go to Ani Jinpa for kindly proofreading the root text, to Lama Alaisdar MacGeaugh, and to Alexander Wilding for his"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Preface 11incessant willingness to share his knowledge of dharma, improve my command of English, and to eliminate my old-fashioned reluc­tance to use computers. Special heartfelt thanks are owed to Katia Holmes who translated Khen Rinpoche's teachings on the root text in 1978 and thus made his instructions accessible for me and was my first teacher of his native language. Finally, I would like to thank Chris Hatchell for his careful and considerate help in editing the text.The stanzas of the root text are presented in accordance with their explanation in the commentary. To stay as closely as possible to the original, the translation keeps the number of lines of the Tibetan text. As to the use of brackets, the content therein was added when it seemed necessary to facilitate understanding. In the case of the root text, these interpolations are derived from the commentary by Jamgon Kongtriil Lodro Thayé; in the case of the commentary they are based on the explanations given by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche.One final point should be noted. Unlike Tibetan, the English lan­guage frequently requires the introduction of a pronoun, so a choice between \"he\" and \"she\" seemed necessary to avoid clumsiness. As buddha nature is neither male nor female, the term \"he,\" when used for a buddha or bodhisattva, should be understood as meaning \"he or she.\" Being a woman myself and convinced of the possibility of reach­ing enlightenment in female appearance, I thought it permissible to make this decision and hope it will not cause offense.Rosemarie Fuchs Hamburg, 23rd of July, 1999"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introductioni.The content of this volume is of the following essence: the teacher who explains the ground, path, and fruition of practice is the perfect Buddha, and from among all philosophies in the world his words are the highest and most genuine. The greatest commentary on their in­tention is the Mahayana Uttara Tantra Shastra, the Treatise on Buddha Nature, which is translated here.This text can be considered as being the speech of the Buddha him­self for the following two reasons: Firstly it was spoken by Maitreya, whom the Buddha empowered to be his regent in Tushita Heaven by placing his crown on Maitreya's head before he left this realm for the human world. Secondly it is stated in the Sutra Compendium:All the rivers in the world, carrying the waters that ripen flowers and fruit and cause forests to thrive, flow due to the power of the Naga King who resides in Lake Madrôpa. Similarly any explana­tion, debate, composition, practice, and attainment of fruition achieved by his retinue of disciples depends solely on the power of the Victorious One himself.For these reasons the Uttara Tantra Shastra can be considered either as the words of the Buddha spoken with his permission, or as those ut­tered by the power of his blessing. However, since according to Lord Maitreya's own words the Uttara Tantra Shastra contains a commen­tary on the intended meaning of the perfect speech of the capable and mighty Buddha himself, it is formally accepted as such. Furthermore, we should bring to mind that there is not the slightest difference be­tween the pure speech of the Buddha on one hand, and that of Maitreya,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"the Lord of the Tenth Level, or of Manjushri, Avalokiteshvara, and Vajrapani, the Lords of the Three Families, on the other. From among all the innumerable commentators on the Buddha's words, their likes have never been seen in this world. For these reasons all the scholars and meditation masters of India and Tibet revere this great commen­tary called the Uttara Tantra Shastra and place it respectfully on the crowns of their heads.II.As to the question of which of the Buddha's sutras are commented upon by the Uttara Tantra Shastra, numerous scholars make many dif­ferent assertions. The glorious Third Karmapa Rangjung Doije, how­ever, clarifies that it is mainly a commentary on the Tathagatagarbha- sutras explaining buddha nature, which the Buddha expounded dur­ing his third turning of the Wheel of Dharma and which express the definitive meaning of all his teachings. Rangjung Dorje explains that the Buddha in his omniscience saw that complete enlightenment is within all sentient beings in terms of their true nature. Yet, due to their ignorance they cannot see this and thus continue to wander through the cycle of existence. To provide the means to clear away the stains of this ignorance, the Buddha taught the Dharma, doing so in a gradual way that corresponded to his disciples' faculty of comprehending the meaning of his words. Initially the Buddha did not expressedly reveal the true nature of reality. Eventually he spoke directly of it, until fi­nally he revealed it in full clarity, as it truly was.The final and supreme among all the Buddha's countless teachings are those that express the definitive meaning and will ripen bodhi- sattvas with sharpest faculties whose mindstreams are thoroughly purified. These teachings are to be found in several sutras containing the profound and secret words of the most evolved philosophical te­net imaginable. Four of these elucidate the Chittamatra philosophy. They are the Sutra Unraveling the Intention (Tib. dgong pa nge par 'grel pa'i mdo), the Travel to Lanka Sutra (Tib. lang kar gshegs pa'i mdo), the Sutra Taught in the Highest Pure Land \"Greatly Adorned\" (Tib. rgyan stug po bkod pa'i mdo), and the Flower Ornament Sutra (Tib. phal po chen). Further sutras conveying the highest view are the Sutra on Buddha Nature (Tib. bde gshegs snyingpo'i mdo), the Sutra of the Great Drum (Tib. rnga po che'i mdo), the Sutra For the Benefit ofAngulimala (Tib. sor mo'i phreng wa la phen pa'i mdo), the Sutra Requested by the Goddess \"Glorious Garland\" (Tib. lha mo dpal phreng gis zhus pa'i mdo), and others.Introduction 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"14 Buddha NaturePeople like us, however, are of dull wits and our wrong views and lack of realization prevent us from being able to understand these sutras directly. In order to sustain the likes of us, Maitreya clearly taught their full content in the Seven Vajra Points that form the Uttara Tantra Shastra.III.Commentators on the words of the Buddha are classified by the schol­ars as being of three types: those of superior, middling, and faint quali­fications. The author of the Uttara Tantra Shastra is not only renowned for possessing the highest qualities, such as profound learning in all sciences and direct vision of the truth of pure being. He is furthermore the undefiable Lord Maitreya who resides on a Dharma-cloud on the tenth bodhisattva level, who is the Buddha's great regent wielding all the powers and mastery that go along with that rank, who has infi­nitely excelled in the practice of the ten perfections, and who due to these achievements stands ready to become the fifth Buddha of this fortunate eon.The one who preserved and spread these teachings of the Uttara Tantra Shastra within the world of humans was the master of learning Asanga. He was born as the son of the former nun Salwe Tsultrim, who out of her superior and altruistic motivation of benefitting the Dharma gave up her robes in times of a severe decline of the Buddha's teachings, married, and had two sons who she prayed would become great masters. Following his mother's wishes, Asanga first studied the Great Vehicle's teachings on \"Manifest Knowledge.\" He found these studies incredibly difficult, however, and eventually turned to the practice of meditation on the deity Maitreya. He went into retreat and continued this practice for twelve years, during which he met with great difficulties again and again, as is related elsewhere in de­tail. After that time, though, Maitreya appeared to Asanga, accepted him as a disciple, and took him to Tushita Heaven. Asanga stayed there at Maitreya's feet for fifty human years, receiving many teach­ings, especially those now known as Maitreya's \"Five Treatises.\" Bring­ing these back to the human world he wrote them down, and propa­gating them widely caused them to flourish. He himself wrote a com­mentary on the Uttara Tantra Shastra and, as was predicted by the Bud­dha in The Root Tantra of Manjushri (Tib. 'jam dpal rtsa rgyud), he be­came one of the two most sublime proponents of the teachings of the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Introduction 15Great Vehicle. In view of his wondrous deeds, all true scholars and meditation masters of India and Tibet would have deepest devotion for Asanga and place him respectfully on the crowns of their heads.IV.There are many commentaries on the Uttara Tantra Shastra written in India and Tibet from the perspectives of both the Empty of Self and the Empty of Other views of the Middle Way philosophical traditions. Especially outstanding is the commentary written by Jamgon Kongtrul Lodrô Thayé. He was a saintly being prophesized by the Buddha in many sutras and tantras. His wisdom and achievement were such that he knew and assimilated every aspect of the philosophies and pith instructions of the eight practice lineages. His commentary is called the Unassailable Lion's Roar.V.In the unequaled tradition of the Dhagpo Kagyii, there are three lines of teachings on the Great Seal or Mahamudra. These are Sutra, Man­tra, and Heart-Essence. Sutra-Mahamudra is the name the incompa­rable Dhagpo Rinpoche, Gampopa, lent to the view expressed in the Uttara Tantra Shastra. He did so in order to soothe the hearts of those who wanted to receive Mahamudra instructions but were not capable of fully comprehending the meaning behind them. He presented Sutra- Mahamudra as a means to guide these disciples towards the under­standing of its latter two types.In a similar way, the Venerable Jamgon Lodrô Thayé presents the Uttara Tantra Shastra as a background and context for the Mahamudra teachings. He explains it in the light of the Empty of Other School and makes its view quite easy to understand. Through his activity he has provided utmost benefit to all practitioners of Mahamudra. Especially nowadays, when centers for the study and practice of the teachings of the Kagyii Lineage have spread to all parts of the world, his instruc­tions become equally important. In order to help the practitioners in these centers worldwide, Lodro Thaye's commentary has been trans­lated into English and been printed in this book.♦ At the request of Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche this was writ­ten by Drupôn Khenpo Acharya Lodrô Namgyal, at Pullahari Maha­mudra Retreat Centre, Kathmandu, Nepal."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Ary a Asanga"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Part OneRoot Text"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"C h ap ter O ne TathagatagarbhaIntroductionI bow down to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.If condensed, the body of the entire commentary [consists of] the following seven vajra points:Buddha, Dharma, the Assembly, the element, enlightenment, qualities, and then buddha activity.In the above order, which presents them in a logical sequence, these [vajra points] should be known to be derived from the Sutra Requested by King Dharanishvara.The [first] three stem from its introductory chapter and the [latter] four from [its chapters] on the properties of those who possess understanding and the Victorious One.From the Buddha [stems] the Dharma, from the Dharma the Assembly of noble ones, from the Assembly the attainment of buddha nature, the element of primordial wisdom.This wisdom finally attained is supreme enlightenment, the powers and so on,[thus] possessing the properties that fulfill the benefit of all sentient beings."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 Buddha NatureThe First Three Vajra Points: The Three Jewels BuddhaBuddha is without beginning, middle, or end. He is peace itself, fully self-awakened and self-expanded in buddhahood.Having reached this state, he shows the indestructible, permanent path so that those who have no realization may realize. Wielding the supreme sword and vajra of knowledge and compassionate love, he cuts the seedling of suffering and destroys the wall of doubts along with its surrounding thicket of various views. I bow down to this Buddha.Being uncreated and spontaneously present, not a realization due to extraneous conditions, wielding knowledge, compassionate love, and ability, buddhahood has [the qualities of] the two benefits.Its nature is without beginning, middle, or end; hence [the state of a buddha] is uncreated.Since it possesses the peaceful dharmakaya, it is described as being \"spontaneously present.\"Since it must be realized through self-awareness, it is not a realization due to extraneous conditions.These three aspects being realized, there is knowledge.Since the path is shown, there is compassionate love.There is ability since the mental poisons and suffering are relinquished by primordial wisdom and compassion.Through the first three there is benefit for oneself.Through the latter three there is benefit for others.DharmaThe Dharma is neither non-existent nor existent. It is not both existent and non-existent, nor is it other than existent and non-existent.It is inaccessible to such investigation and cannot be defined. It is self-aware and peace.The Dharma is without defilement. Holding the brilliant light rays of primordial wisdom, it fully defeats attachment, aversion, and dull indifference with regard to all objects of perception. I bow down to this sun of the sacred Dharma."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Root Text 21Inconceivable, free from the two [veils] and from thought, being pure, clear, and playing the part of an antidote, it is free from attachment and frees from attachment.This is the Dharma with its features of the two truths.Freedom from attachment [as fruit and means] consists of the truths of cessation and path.Accordingly these should also be known by means of three qualities each.Not being an object of conceptual investigation, being inexpressible, and [only] to be known by noble ones, the Dharma is inconceivable. Since it is peace, it is free from the two [veils] and free from thought. In its three [aspects of] purity and so on it is similar to the sun.SanghaThis mind being by nature clear light, they have seen the poisons to be essencelessand therefore truly realize [the nature of] every being as peace, the ultimate non-existence of a self. They perceive that the Perfect Buddha pervades them all.They possess the understanding that is free from the veils. Thus seeing that beings are utterly pure and that [this purity pervades] their limitless number, they are endowed with the vision of primordial wisdom. I bow down to this [Sangha].The assembly of those who have understanding and thus do not fall back has unsurpassable qualities, since their vision of inner primordial wisdom, which knows correctly and knows completely, is pure.Realizing beings in their state of peace [the noble ones] know correctly, for [the mind] is by nature utterly pure and the poisons were always exhausted.Their understanding, which realizes the knowableas well as [its] ultimate condition, seesthat the state of omniscience is within all beings.Thus the [noble ones] know completely."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"22 Buddha NatureSuch realization is the vision of wisdom that is self-aware. This wisdom is pure, since it [sees] the undefiled expanse, free from attachment and obstruction.Their vision [of] primordial wisdom is pure and [nears] unsurpassable buddha wisdom.The noble ones who do not fall back are therefore a refuge for all beings.The Three RefugesThere being the teacher, his teaching, and his disciples leads to respective aspirations towards three vehicles and to three different activities [of veneration].Viewing this, the refuge is shown as threefold.[The Dharma] will be abandoned and is of an unsteady nature.It is not [the ultimate quality], and [the Sangha] is still with fear. Thus the two aspects of Dharma and the Assembly of noble ones do not represent the supreme refuge, which is constant and stable.In a true sense only the Buddha is beings' refuge, since the Great Sage embodies the dharmakaya, and the Assembly also reaches its ultimate goal when these [qualities of dharmakaya are attained].Their occurence is rare, they are free from defilement, they possess power, they are the adornment of the world, they are sublime, and they are unchanging.Thus [they are named] \"rare and sublime.\"The Last Four Vajra PointsThe virtuous Three Jewels, which are rare and sublime, arise from suchness bound up with pollution, from the one free from pollution,from the qualities of unpolluted buddhahood, and from the deeds of the Victor.This is the object of those who see the ultimate truth.The disposition of the Three Rare and Sublime Ones is the object [of vision] of those who see everything."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Root Text 23Furthermore, these four aspects in the given order are inconceivable, for the following four reasons:[The buddha element] is pure and yet has affliction. [Enlightenment] was not afflicted and yet is purified.Qualities are totally indivisible [and yet unapparent].[Activity] is spontaneous and yet without any thought.Constituting what must be realized, realization, its attributes, and the means to bring it about, accordingly the first is the cause to be purified and the [latter] three points are the conditions.The Fourth Vajra Point: The ElementThe perfect buddhakaya is all-embracing, suchness cannot be differentiated, and all beings have the disposition.Thus they always have buddha nature.The Buddha has said that all beings have buddha nature \"since buddha Wisdom is always present within the assembly of beings,since this undefiled nature is free from duality, and since the disposition to buddhahood has been named after its fruit.\"Essence, cause, fruit, function, endowment, manifestation, phases, all-pervasiveness of suchness, unchangingness, and inseparability of the qualities should be understood as intended to describe the meaning of the absolute expanse.Just as a jewel, the sky, and water are pure it is by nature always free from the poisons.From devotion to the Dharma, from highest wisdom, and from samadhi and compassion [its realization arises].[Wielding] power, not changing into something else, and being a nature that has a moistening [quality]: these [three] have properties corresponding to those of a precious gem, the sky, and water."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"24 Buddha NatureEnmity towards the Dharma, a view [asserting an existing] self, fear of samsara's suffering, and neglect of the welfare of fellow beings are the four veils of those with great desire, of tirthikas, shravakas, and pratyekabuddhas.The cause that purifies [all these veils] consists of the four qualities [of the path], which are outstanding devotion and so on.Those whose seed is devotion towards the supreme vehicle, whose mother is analytical wisdom generating the buddha qualities, whose abode is the blissful womb of meditative stability, and whose nurse is compassion, are heirs bom to succeed the Muni.The fruit is the perfection of the qualities of purity, self, happiness, and permanence.Weariness of suffering, longing to attain peace, and devotion towards this aim are the function.In brief, the fruit of these [purifying causes] fully divides into the remedies [for the antidotes], which [in their turn] counteract the four aspects of wrong beliefs with regard to the dharmakaya.The [dharmakaya] is purity, since its nature is pure and [even] the remaining imprints are fully removed.It is true self, since all conceptual elaboration in terms of self and non-self is totally stilled.It is true happiness, since [even] the aggregates of mental nature and their causes are reversed.It is permanence, since the cycle of existence and the state beyond pain are realized as one.Their analytical wisdom has cut all self-cherishing without exception.Yet, cherishing beings, those possessed of compassion do not adhere to peace.Relying on understanding and compassionate love, the means to enlightenment,noble ones will neither [abide] in samsara nor in a [limited] nirvana."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Root Text 25If the buddha element were not present, there would be no remorse over suffering.There would be no longing for nirvana, nor striving and devotion towards this aim.That with regard to existence and nirvana their respective fault and quality are seen,that suffering is seen as the fault of existence and happiness as the quality of nirvana, stems from the presence of the disposition to buddhahood. \"Why so?\" In those who are devoid of disposition, such seeing does not occur.Like the great sea it holds qualities immeasurable, precious, and inexhaustible.Its essence holds indivisible properties.Thus [the element] is similar to a lamp.Unifying the elements of dharmakaya, a victor's wisdom, and great compassion, it is shown as being similar to the sea by the vessel, the gems, and the water.Clairvoyance, primordial wisdom, and absence of pollution are totally indivisible and native to the unstained abode.Thus it has properties corresponding to the light, heat, and color of a lamp.Based upon the manifestation of suchness dividing into that of an ordinary being, that of a noble one, and that of a perfect buddha, He who Sees Thatness has explained the nature of the Victor to beings.[It manifests as] perverted [views in] ordinary beings,[as] the reversal [of these in] those who see the truth, and [it manifests] as it is, in an unperverted way, and as freedom from elaboration [in] a tathagata.The unpurified, the both unpurified and purified,and the utterly purified [phases]are expressed in their given order[by the names] \"being,\" \"bodhisattva,\" and \"tathagata.\""},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"26 Buddha NatureThe element as contained in the six topics of \"essence\" and so on is explained in the light of three phases by means of three names.Just as space, which is by nature free from thought, pervades everything,the undefiled expanse, which is the nature of mind, is all-pervading.As the general feature [of everything], it embraces [those with] faults,[those with] qualities, and [those in whom the qualities are] ultimatejust as space [pervades everything] visible, be it of inferior, average, or supreme appearance.Having faults that are adventitious and qualities that are its nature, it is afterwards the same as before.This is dharmata ever unchanging.[Though] space permeates everything, it is never polluted, due to its subtlety.Likewise the [dharmadhatu] in all beings does not suffer the slightest pollution.Just as at all times worlds arise and disintegrate in space, the senses arise and disintegrate in the uncreated expanse.Space is never burnt by fires.Likewise this [dharmadhatu] is not burnt by the fires of death, sickness, and aging.Earth rests upon water and water upon wind.Wind fully rests on space.Space does not rest upon any of the elements of wind, water, or earth."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Root Text 27Likewise skandhas, elements, and senses are based upon karma and mental poisons. Karma and poisons are always based upon improper conceptual activity.The improper conceptual activity fully abides on the purity of mind.Yet, the nature of the mind itself has no basis in all these phenomena.The skandhas, entrances, and elements are to be known as resembling earth.Karma and the mental poisons of beings should be envisaged as the water element. Improper conceptual activity is viewed as being similar to the element of wind.[Mind's] nature, as the element of space, has no ground and no place of abiding.The improper conceptual activity rests upon the nature of the mind.Improper conceptual activity brings about all the classes of karma and mental poisons. From the water of karma and mental poisons the skandhas, entrances, and elements arise.As this [world] arises and disintegrates, they will arise and disintegrate as well.The nature of mind as the element of space does not [depend upon] causes or conditions, nor does it [depend on] a gathering of these.It has neither arising, cessation, nor abiding.This clear and luminous nature of mind is as changeless as space. It is not afflicted by desire and so on, the adventitious stains, which are sprung from incorrect thoughts.It is not brought into existence by the water of karma, of the poisons, and so on.

Generosity only yields wealth, discipline leads to the higher states of existence, and meditation removes affliction.Discriminative wisdom fully abandons all afflictions and [hindrances to] knowledge.It is therefore supreme, and its cause is studying these.The presence [of the element], its result, its qualities, and the achievement of benefit are the objects of understanding of a buddha.When towards these four, as explained above, one of understanding is filled with devotion to their presence, ability, and qualities, he will be quickly endowed with the fortune by which one attains the state of a tathagata.Those who realize: \"This inconceivable object is present and someone like me can attain it; its attainment will hold such qualities and endowment\" will aspire to it, filled with faith.Thus becoming vessels of all qualities, such as longing, diligence, mindfulness, meditative stability, wisdom, and so on, bodhichitta will be ever-present in them.[Bodhichitta] being ever-present in them the heirs of the Victor will not fall back.The perfection of merit will be refined until being transformed into total purity.Once these five perfections of merit are not ideated in threefold division, they will become perfect and fully pure, as their opposite facets are abandoned."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Root Text 7iThe merit of generosity arises from giving, that of morality arises from moral conduct.The two aspects of patience and meditative stability stem from meditation, and diligence accompanies all.Whatever ideates [in terms of] the three circles is viewed as the veil of the hindrances to knowledge.Whatever is the impulse of avarice and so on is to be regarded as the veil of the mental poisons.Since apart from discriminative wisdom there is no other cause to remove these [veils], this discriminative wisdom is supreme.Its ground being study, such study is supreme.Based on the trustworthy words of the Buddha and on scriptures of logic,I have explained this for the sole purposeof purifying myself and supporting all thosewhose understanding has the best of virtue and devotion.As someone with eyes sees by relying on a lamp, or on lightning, a jewel, the sun, or the moon, this has been truly explained by relying on the Muni, brilliant in meaning, words, phenomena, and power.Whatever speech is meaningful and well connected with Dharma,which removes all afflictions of the three realmsand shows the benefit of the [attainment] of peace,is the speech of the Sage, while any different speech is other.Whatever someone has explained with undistracted mind, exclusively in the light of the Victor's teaching, and conducive to the path of attaining release, one should place on one's head as the words of the Sage.There is no one in this world more skilled in Dharma than the Victor. No other has such insight, knowing everything without exception [and knowing] supreme thatness the way it is.Thus one should not distort the sutras presented by the Sage himself, since this would destroy the Muni's manner [of teaching] and furthermore cause harm to the sacred Dharma."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"76 Buddha NatureThose blinded by poisons [and possessed of] the nature of ignorance revile the noble ones and despise the teachings they have spoken. Since all this stems from a fixated view, mind should not be joined with polluted vision.Clean cloth is totally transformed by color, but never is cloth [to be treated] with oil.Due to a feeble intellect, lack of striving for virtue, reliance on false pride, a nature obscured by neglect of pure Dharma, taking the provisional for the definitive meaning—for thatness, craving for profit, being under the sway of [inferior] views, relying on thosedisapproving [of Dharma], staying away from those who uphold the teachings,and due to mean devotion, the teachings of the Foe-Vanquishers are abandoned.Skillful beings must not be as deeply afraid of fire and cruel poisonous snakes, of murderers or lightning, as they should be of the loss of the profound Dharma.Fire, snakes, enemies, and thunderbolts [can] only separate us from this life,but cannot take us to the utterly fearful states of [the hells] of direst pain.Even someone who has relied on evil friends again and again and thus heeded harmful intentions towards a buddha, who has committed one of the most heinous acts—killing his father, mother, or an arhat, or splitting the sublime Assembly— will be quickly released from these, once genuinely reflecting the dharmata.But where would liberation be for someone whose mind is hostile to Dharma?Having properly explained the seven [vajra] points of the jewels, the utterly pure element, flawless enlightenment, qualities, and activity, may any virtue I harvest from this lead all sentient beings to see the Lord of Boundless Life who is endowed with Infinite Light.Upon seeing, may their stainless Dharma-eye open and may they reach highest enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Root Text T,On what basis, for what reason, and in what way [this has been given], what it explains and what cause is conducive [to understanding it] have been taught by means of four stanzas.Two stanzas [show] the means to purify oneself and one [shows] the cause of deterioration.Thereupon, by means of two further stanzas the fruit [sprung from deterioration] is explained.[Being bom] in the mandala of a buddha's retinue, attaining patience and [then] enlightenment: expressing these qualities, the two aspects of fruit are explained by the last in a summarized way.♦ This was the section \"Benefit,\" the fifth chapter of The Commentary on the Highest Continuity of the Mahayana Dharma which Analyzes the Disposition of the Rare and Sublime Ones."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Jamgön Kongtrill Lodrö Thayé"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"part twoCommentary: The Unassailable Lion's Roar"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Table of ContentsA.

Combination of the two languages [not translated]B.L12. Explanation of their meaning [not translated]B.I.2. Salutation of the translatorI bow down to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.For the term \"buddha/' as he is called in his native language, in Tibetan the term sangs rgyas [pronounced \"sanjay\"] is used, which lit­erally means \"awakened and expanded.\" This refers to two aspects: abandonment and realization. A buddha has awoken from the sleep of ignorance just as, for example, one wakes up from ordinary sleep. This is the aspect of abandonment. Similar to a fully blossomed lotus, his understanding has expanded with regard to the knowable. This is the aspect of realization.The Tibetan equivalent for the Sanskrit term \"bodhisattva\" is byang chub sems dpaf [pronounced \"jang chub sem pa\"], the three compo­nents of which can be literally translated as \"enlightenment\" (Tib. byang chub), \"mind\" (Tib. sems), and \"courage\" (Tib. dpa'). This refers to the fact that a bodhisattva has two objectives. By means of his discrimina­tive wisdom he focuses on enlightenment, and by means of his com­passion he focuses on beings [literally, \"on those who have a mind\"]."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"98 Buddha NatureThe term sems dpa' can also be understood as \"courageous mind\" in terms of mental steadfastness, curative capacity, inner strength, and courage, which refer to the fact that a bodhisattva is capable of endur­ing great hardships for the sake of enlightenment.To all these buddhas and bodhisattvas I bow down respectfully with body, speech, and mind.Before the great translators undertook a translation work, they first paid homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas. Likewise, we should follow their example and also begin by bowing down to our yidam deity before we engage in an explanation or a similar task.B.II. The actual commentary, which has supreme meaning B.II.l. Presentation of the body of the textB.II.1.1. Explanation of the body of the commentary as consisting of sevenvajra pointsIf condensed, the body of the entire commentary [consists of] the following seven vajra points:Buddha, Dharma, the Assembly, the element, enlightenment, qualities, and then buddha activity.In a condensed way, the entire content or body of the commentary to be explained is taught in terms of seven vajra points. The term \"vajra\" is used since a precious vajra is composed of indestructible material, and the subject to be expressed is difficult to penetrate by means of the discriminative wisdoms resulting from study and reflection.The first point contains the explanation of perfect buddhahood, which constitutes what is to be attained—this being the ultimate level of the two benefits, which are benefit for oneself and benefit for others.The second point explains the sacred Dharma as having the charac­teristics of the two truths, which are free from attachment.The third point is the Sangha of the noble ones, the assembly of those who do not fall back since they possess the two types of primor­dial wisdom (Skt. jhdna, Tib. ye shes).The fourth point explains the expanse (Tib. dbyings) or the element of beings that is by nature completely pure. This is what needs to be truly realized, its realization constituting the way in which Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are attained.The fifth point is unsurpassable enlightenment, the essence of real­ization, the state in which this element is purified from all defilements without the slightest remainder."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The sixth point describes the qualities accompanying great enlight­enment. They are the attributes of realization and consist of [two] fruits: those of freedom and complete maturation.Finally, the seventh point explains buddha activity, which is spon­taneous and uninterrupted. This is the power or ability of the quali­ties, the means causing others to gain realization. (See also Part Three, annotation 1.)B.1I.1.2. Reference to the sutras constituting their sourceIn the above order, which presents them in a logical sequence, these [vajra points] should be known to be derived from the Sutra Requested by King Dharanishvara.The [first] three stem from its introductory chapter and the [latter] four from [its chapters] on the properties of those who possess understanding and the Victorious One.The order in which these seven vajra points are explained here, where they are presented in a logical sequence corresponding to their essence or characteristics, is the same as given in the sutra famed as The Explanation of the Great Compassion of the Tathagata, or the Sutra Requested by King Dharanishvara (Skt. Tathagatamaha-karunanirdesa- sutra/ Dharanlsvarardjapariprcchd, Tib. de bzhin gshegs pai thugs rje chen po bstan pai mdo/ gzungs kyi dbang phyug rgyal pos zhus pai mdo). In this context the first three vajra points, the explanation of the Three Jewels, should be known as being derived from the introductory chap­ter of this sutra. The bodhisattva Dharanishvararaja says there [in an­swer to a question of the Buddha]:0 Bhagavan! He is directly and perfectly awakened and expanded within the equality of all phenomena. He faultlessly turns the wheel of Dharma. He possesses a limitless assembly of extremely well trained disciples...,and so on.As for the remaining four vajra points, first the buddha element is elucidated by means of \"The Explanation of the Sixty Methods of Com­pletely Purifying the Qualities or Properties of the Path of a Bodhi­sattva who Possesses Understanding,\" which follows upon the intro­ductory chapter. In relation to this [Nagarjuna], in the Dharmadhatustava (Tib. chos kyi dbyings su bstod pa), says:The Unassailable Lion's Roar 99"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"If the element is present and one labors, pure natural gold will be seen. If the element is not present, no matter how much one la­bors, one only exhausts oneself in weariness and pain.Since a ground to be purified from the defilements is present in the form of the tathagatagarbha or the dharmadhatu, which is by nature pure, it is justified to show ways of complete purification for the sake of its direct manifestation.The sixty methods of complete purification are the four ornaments of a bodhisattva, the eight aspects of appearance, the sixteen kinds of great compassion, and the thirty-two kinds of activity.The last three vajra points should be understood as being derived from \"The Explanation of the Eighty Types of Qualities of the Victori­ous One.\" Following the explanation of the dharmadhatu, enlighten­ment is elucidated from the explanation of the sixteen kinds of great compassion. After that, the qualities are clarified by means of the ex­planation of the ten powers, the four kinds of fearlessness, and the eighteen exclusive or unmixed features of a buddha. Subsequently, activity is elucidated by means of the explanation of the thirty-two aspects of the unsurpassable activity of a tathagata. With the passage: \"O Son of Noble Family, the action of a tathagata consists of these thirty-two!\" action and actor are expressed simultaneously.Due to the formulation in the root text [the last syllable of the stanza (Skt. sloka) explained here being a particle that could either be under­stood as a finishing or a combining particle] some scholars hold that the way in which the seven vajra points are explained is derived from different sutras. According to this opinion the Three Jewels are de­rived from the Sutra Teaching Higher Reflection (Skt. Drdha-parivarta, Tib. lhag pa'i bsam pa bstan pa'i mdo). The element is derived from the Sutra that is Free from Increase and Obscuration (Skt. Anunatvdpürnatvá- nirdesa-parivarta, Tib. 'phel ba dang 'grib pa med pa'i mdo). Enlighten­ment stems from the Lion's Roar of Shrimaladevi Sutra (Skt. Srimaladevi- simhanádasütra, Tib. lha mo dpal 'phrenggi sengge'i sgra'i mdo), the quali­ties from the Sutra that is Free from Increase and Obscuration (Skt. Anun- atvapümatvd-nirdesa-parivarta, Tib. 'phel 'grib med pa'i mdo), and activity from the Sutra Showing the Realm of the Inconceivable Qualities and Wis­dom of the Tathagata (Skt.

From having become [a member of] the Sangha, this primordial wis­dom of a buddha is finally attained at the end of the process in which the defilements obscuring the buddha nature are removed. This is the attainment of supreme enlightenment. This enlightenment possesses the qualities, which consist of the powers and so on.

I bow down to this Buddha.Since buddhahood is free from an initial coming into existence, an abiding in the meantime, and a final cessation, it is uncreated. Since all thoughts and conceptual elaborations are pacified, it is spontane­ously present. Since a buddha is fully self-awakened and self-expanded without a teacher by means of self-aware primordial wisdom, buddha­hood is not a realization due to extraneous conditions. These are the qualities constituting one's own benefit.Since a buddha has awoken from the sleep of ignorance and his understanding has expanded to embrace the knowable, he has gained possession of the most excellent knowledge. By means of this knowl­edge he shows within samsara the permanent path, the meaning of the indestructible true state (Skt. dharmata, Tib. chos nyid). This is com­passionate love.

Since it is free from delib­erate effort, it has the quality of being spontaneously present (2).

Since he brings about the relinquishment of the causes of suffering of all other beings, thereby eradicating the suffering that is the fruit of these causes, he has the quality of being endowed with ability (6).In terms of subject matter there are six different kinds of qualities. If classified according to aspects, the first three form the quality of best possible benefit for oneself, and the latter three form the quality of best possible benefit of others. Considering these as a whole, buddhahood possesses eight qualities. (See also Part Three, annotation 5.)B.ll.2.1.1.3. Detailed explanation by combining the praise and its meaningIts nature is without beginning, middle, or end; hence [the state of a buddha] is uncreated.Since it possesses the peaceful dharmakaya, it is described as being \"spontaneously present.\"Since it must be realized through self-awareness, it is not a realization due to extraneous conditions.These three aspects being realized, there is knowledge.Since the path is shown, there is compassionate love.There is ability since the mental poisons and suffering are relinquished by primordial wisdom and compassion.Through the first three there is benefit for oneself.Through the latter three there is benefit for others.Here buddhahood is explained in such a way that the statements made in the foregoing section on the different types of qualities are successively proven on the basis of the reasons taught in the praise:(1) Whatever is compounded or created consists of the three as­pects of beginning, middle, and end, or in other words, has the prop­erties of coining into existence, of abiding, and then being destroyed. Since buddhahood is of a nature that is free from these, it is uncreated.Generally speaking there are four teachings with regard to the term \"uncreated.\" Depending upon the following criteria, the subject in"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"104 Buddha Naturequestion is considered as being created or uncreated: The first crite­rion is whether or not there is arising and cessation due to causes and conditions. The second is whether or not there is arising and cessation of karma and mental poisons. The third is whether or not arising through a body of mental nature and cessation in terms of an incon­ceivable death take place. The fourth is whether or not the subject in question appears to the disciples as something that arises and ceases.In this context, Rongtonpa holds that in the light of these four crite­ria the dharmakaya of all buddhas is uncreated, in the sense of not appearing to the disciples as something that comes into existence and ceases.It is therefore necessary to understand that buddhahood possesses the quality of being uncreated. Yet if one takes it as a whole as being uncreated, one needs to understand that this contradicts its having knowledge, compassionate love, and ability.(2) Buddhahood is endowed with the dharmakaya itself, which is complete peace. It is peace in the sense of freedom from any deliber­ate effort in terms of the concept-bound activity of body and speech, the conceptual activity of the mind, and so on. Therefore it is described as \"spontaneously present activity.\"(3) Since it must be realized by means of self-sprung primordial wisdom being self-aware, it is not a realization due to outer condi­tions such as other people's utterances and so on.(4) Having realized the dharmadhatu in its three aspects of quali­ties, which are uncreatedness and so on, a buddha [also] realizes that it is within all sentient beings alike. Thus he possesses the most excel­lent primordial wisdom of knowledge.(5) In order to lead all other beings who are to be trained to this ultimate purity, he clearly demonstrates the path beyond the world in accordance with their respective karmic fortunes. Therefore he pos­sesses the most excellent love and compassion.(6) By means of his primordial wisdom and his great compassion mentioned before, he is able to cause the relinquishment of the suffer­ing of beings, eradicating their skandhas, which attract suffering, and their mental poisons, which cause these skandhas, up to their very end. Therefore he possesses the most excellent activity or ability.In this context it is explained that by the first three qualities the best possible benefit for oneself is accomplished, while the latter three ac­complish the best possible benefit of others.

Presentation of the subject matter by means of a praiseThe Dharma is neither non-existent nor existent. It is not both existent and non-existent, nor is it other than existent and non-existent.It is inaccessible to such investigation and cannot be defined.It is self-aware and peace.The Dharma is without defilement. Holding the brilliant light rays of primordial wisdom,it fully defeats attachment, aversion, and dull indifference with regard to all objects of perception. I bow down to this sun of the sacred Dharma.(1) The sacred Dharma in terms of the truth of cessation does not fall into the extreme of nihilism, which is the belief in non-existence, since the absolute truth, or in other words, the dharmadhatu, suchness, the true nature, exists as the field of experience of self-aware primor­dial wisdom.It does not fall into the extreme of etemalism, which is the belief in existence, since it has been free from arising as a relative adventitious thing since beginningless time.It is also not the common basis of a collection of the two aspects \"existent\" and \"non-existent,\" since on one hand it is neither of these, both having been refuted, and since on the other hand they contradict each other.Since it is impossible for something to be both existent and non­existent, it cannot be investigated as their contrary either, as some­thing other than both existent and non-existent.For this reason the Dharma is completely liberated from the con­ceptual elaboration consisting of the four extreme views (Tib. mu bzhi).Since it is inexpressible by means of symbols and terms and since it is truly beyond the field of experience of speech, it cannot be verbally defined.It cannot be explained by means of examples, logical reasonings, and so on. Not being an object of experience of an other-aware per­ception, it must be perceived by the noble ones through self-aware­ness. For these reasons it is inconceivable.Since karma and the mental poisons, the root of samsara, are paci­fied, it is free from these two aspects.

In terms of subject matter the Dharma has six qualities:The first three consist of the facts that it is inconceivable in that it cannot be grasped by a conceptual understanding (1), it is free from the two [veils] of karma and the mental poisons (2), and it is free from their cause, which is improper conceptual activity (3).The latter three consist of the facts that it is pure, since the defile­ments that [obscured] the essence have been purified (4), it is clear, since it illuminates all phenomena (5), and it plays the part of the very antidote that counteracts the three poisons (6).If classified in terms of aspects, the first three qualities constitute the fruit, the truth of cessation, which must be freed from attachment [and will then be revealed as being freedom from attachment] (7). The latter three constitute the cause, the truth of the path, which frees one from attachment (8). Thus it has the characteristics of the two truths, which comprise full purification.

Summary of the categories in terms of the truth of cessation and the truth of the pathFreedom from attachment [as fruit and means] consists of the truths of cessation and path.Accordingly these should also be known by means of three qualities each.Freedom from attachment or desire is called the Dharma. This con­sists of the truth of cessation, which is the fruit—that which is free from attachment—and of the truth of the path, which is the means to free oneself from attachment. In the given order these two truths should also be known as being explained by means of three qualities each. The truth of cessation, when it has twofold purity, is explained by means of the three qualities of being inconceivable, free from the two veils, and free from thought. The truth of the path, which causes puri­fication, is explained by means of the three qualities of being pure, clear, and an antidote. (See also Part Three, annotation 9.)B. 11.2.1.2A. Explanation of the reasons by combining the praise and its meaningNot being an object of conceptual investigation, being inexpressible, and [only] to be known by noble ones, the Dharma is inconceivable.Since it is peace, it is free from the two [veils] and free from thought.In its three [aspects of] purity and so on it is similar to the sun.Taking the reasons from the above section, where the Dharma is explained in the form of a praise, its different categories are succes­sively proven and explained as follows:The Dharma to be attained, the truth of cessation, is not an object to be investigated by means of an understanding that perceives in terms of the four extreme views of existence, non-existence, and so on. It is not an object to be expressed by means of words, terms, definitions, and so forth, and it has to be known by the noble ones through self- aware primordial wisdom, which is present during meditation. For these three reasons it is inconceivable for a worldly understanding.Since the karma bound up with pollution and the mental poisons fully raising this karma have come to peace, the truth of cessation is free from these two [veils]. It is free from thought since the improper conceptual activity that acts as their cause has been pacified."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"108 Buddha NatureThe three aspects of purity and so on, that is, purity, clarity, and acting as an antidote, are the three qualities of the paths of seeing and meditation, which cause the attainment of this truth of cessation. These are to be understood as being like the sun in that there are three corre­sponding properties. Just as the orb of the sun is completely pure, the truth of the path is free from all the defilements of [even] the second­ary mental poisons. In the same way as the sun illuminates the vis­ible, the truth of the path illuminates all the aspects of the knowable, or in other words, all phenomena. Just as the sun acts as an antidote that overcomes darkness, the truth of the path acts as the antidote against all obstructions preventing the seeing of suchness.

They perceive that the Perfect Buddha pervades them all.They possess the understanding that is free from the veils.Thus seeing that beings are utterly pure and that [this purity pervades] their limitless number, they are endowed with the vision of primordial wisdom. I bow down to this [Sangha].Of the different types of Sangha, the bodhisattvas who do not fall back are an especially noble assembly. Since their own minds have directly revealed themselves as being by nature clear light and func­tioning as the antidote itself, they have seen that the essence of the mental poisons to be abandoned has been free from arising since be- ginningless time. Therefore the bodhisattvas truly realize the nature of every being just as it is. They realize it as a state of peace or as freedom from any conceptual elaboration: the ultimate selflessness of persons and of phenomena. By means of this realization they have primordial wisdom that knows correctly.They see that the nature of a perfect buddha—the dharmakaya, the true state—has always been present within beings whose state is rela­tive, such that it pervades them all. By means of this seeing they have the primordial wisdom that knows completely.These two types of primordial wisdom are the quality of awareness."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 10$In the given order, these are also an understanding that is free from the veil of attachment and one that is free from the veil of obstruc­tions. With these understandings the bodhisattvas possess the discrimi­native wisdom beyond the worldly. By means of this discriminative wisdom, they have the perception that knows the utterly pure dharma­dhatu of beings, and furthermore knows that this dharmadhatu per­vades their limitless number. Therefore they possess the completely pure vision of primordial wisdom with regard to the entire range of the knowable.This is the quality of liberation.I bow down to these [bodhisattvas] with open faith. (See also Part Three, annotation 11.)B.1L2.1.3.2. The Sangha is established as having two or six qualitiesThe assembly of those who have understanding and thus do not fall back has unsurpassable qualities, since their vision of inner primordial wisdom, which knows correctly and knows completely, is pure.(1) By the preceding section the rare and sublime Sangha is shown as having two qualities:Focusing on the true state as their object, noble ones perceive the presence of suchness just as it is. They see this in a way that is not held in common with other beings: by means of inner self-aware primordial wisdom. This vision is purified from the veil of attachment. For this reason they have the quality of primordial wisdom that knows correctly.Focusing on those whose state is relative as their object, noble ones perceive that the dharmadhatu is all-pervasively present within all sentient beings alike, no matter how many there are. This is also seen in a way that is not held in common with others: by means of inner self-aware primordial wisdom. This vision is purified from the veil of obstruction.

It knows completely since it realizes that this dharmadhatu pervades all knowable things, and since it is free from the veil of the hindrances to knowledge, which are bound up with obstruction.

Explanation of the three kinds of refuge B.II.2.1.4.1. The necessity to present three types ofrefigeThere being the teacher, his teaching, and his disciples leads to respective aspirations towards three vehicles and to three different activities [of veneration].Viewing this, the refuge is shown as threefold.For the following reason the refuge is presented as being threefold:The fact that the qualities of the Buddha who is the teacher are taught entails two different reactions. On one hand there are those [individu­als] who see the qualities of this teacher and thereupon strive for the attainment of buddhahood. Of the three vehicles they follow the Mahayana. On the other hand there are those who of the three types of activities of veneration have the aspiration of venerating the Bud­dha as being supreme among gods and humans. Considering this, buddhahood is presented as the first of the three refuges.Likewise, the fact that the qualities of the sacred Dharma are taught leads to two reactions. On one hand there are those [individuals] who see the qualities of this teaching and thereupon wish to realize and attain the profound Dharma of interdependent origination on their own. They follow the Pratyekabuddhayana. On the other hand there are those who have the aspiration of venerating the Dharma as being supreme among that which is free from desire. Considering this, the Dharma is presented as the second refuge.The fact that the qualities of the Sangha, of the assembly of dis­ciples, are taught leads to the following two reactions: On one hand there are those [individuals] who see the qualities of these disciples and thereupon wish to attain their state, [the state of an arhat], by practicing the teaching [of the Buddha] as taught by others. They fol­low the Shravakayana. On the other hand there are those who have the aspiration of venerating the Sangha as supreme among assem­blies. Considering this, the Sangha is presented as the third refuge.Put briefly, the refuge is presented as being threefold in consider­ation of the fact that the three aspects [of teacher, teaching, and dis­ciples] result in six types of individuals. This presentation is taught in order to enable beings to gradually gain access [to the path].

Explanation ofiuhich is the ultimate refuge and which are not[The Dharma] will be abandoned and is of an unsteady nature.It is not [the ultimate quality], and [the Sangha] is still with fear. Thus the two aspects of Dharma and the Assembly of noble ones do not represent the supreme refuge, which is constant and stable.In a true sense only the Buddha is beings' refuge, since the Great Sage embodies the dharmakaya, and the Assembly also reaches its ultimate goal when these [qualities of dharmakaya are attained].One may wonder whether the three kinds of refuge explained above equally represent an ultimate refuge. This is not the case.The Dharma in terms of teaching is to be abandoned like a boat is left behind once one has crossed the water. Of the two aspects of Dharma in terms of realization, the realization of those who travel the path of training proceeds from one level to the next and is therefore of an unsteady or changing nature. The truths of cessation of the lesser vehicles and of [bodhisattvas] traveling the path of training do not constitute the ultimate quality. The Sanghas of arhats of the lesser ve­hicles and of noble bodhisattvas who are on the path of training are still with the fear of the veils. As long as they have not arrived at the level of a buddha who is free from fear, they themselves will take ref­uge in the Buddha as well. For these reasons, neither the two aspects of Dharma, that is, teaching and realization, which constitute the train­ing, nor the assemblies of the noble ones who are the trainees, are the constant and stable supreme refuge.In a true or definitive sense only a buddha is the ultimate refuge of the limitless number of sentient beings, since the Great Sage, the Bud­dha, is the embodiment of the dharmakaya, which is the completion of freedom from desire and attachment, and since the members of the assembly, the Sangha, also reach their ultimate [goal] when they at­tain the qualities of this [dharmakaya].Here [in the context of the Mahay ana Uttara Tantra Shastra) the Bud­dha is called \"the inexhaustible refuge,\" \"the permanent refuge,\" \"the immutable refuge\" (Tib. g.yung drunggi skydbs), and \"the absolute ref­uge.\" In the given order this explanation refers to the fact that a buddha is free from death, free from birth, free from aging, and that he is un­failing.

It is derived from the term \"ratna\" [Skt. for \"jewel\"] and is here defined by means of six aspects corresponding to the properties of a precious [wish-fulfilling] gem.A [wish-fulfilling] jewel is difficult to find. Its essence is free from defilements. It possesses the power to fulfill needs and wishes. Due to its beauty it becomes an adornment. It is more sublime than an artifi­cial gem and it does not change through being praised, blamed, and so on. Likewise, the occurrence of the three refuges is also rare, since those who have not cultivated the roots of virtue will not meet them even in the course of many kalpas or eons. The three refuges are free from the pollution of the two veils. They possess the inconceivable power of the qualities of clairvoyance and so on. Since they are the cause of all virtuous thoughts and intentions of sentient beings in the world, they have become its adornment. Since they are beyond the world, they are more sublime than anything worldly. Since they are not created by karma, mental poisons, and so on, they are unchanging. For these reasons they are similar to a precious [wish-fulfilling] gem and are therefore expressed by means of the name \"rare and sublime.\"THE LAST FOUR VAJRA POINTSB.II.2.2.

In the phase"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 115of the level of buddhahood this dharmadhatu is called \"the dharma­kaya of the Tathagata.\" The level of a buddha is characterized by a complete change or transformation of state, in that through cultivat­ing the path this tathagatagarbha has become free from all the adven­titious defilements up to their very end. This is suchness free from pollution. What is linked with this dharmakaya are the buddha prop­erties such as the powers and so on, constituting the fruits of freedom and of complete maturation. These properties are the qualities of un­polluted buddhahood. Through the power of these qualities there is unsurpassable activity accomplishing the benefit of sentient beings, spontaneously and uninterruptedly, in ways corresponding to each individual. This activity consists of the deeds of the Victor.These four points constitute the cause and the conditions for the arising of the fruit, of the virtuous Three Jewels, which are rare and sublime. The way in which this arising takes place is inconceivable to shravakas, pratyekabuddhas, noble ones, and so on. This is solely the object of perception of buddhas who possess the ultimate primordial wisdom that directly sees the true state of everything or the absolute truth. (See also Part Three, annotation 17.)B 1122.1.2. Explanation that they are inconceivableThe disposition of the Three Rare and Sublime Ones is the object [of vision] of those who see everything.Furthermore, these four aspects in the given order are inconceivable, for the following four reasons:The [last] four [vajra] points are the disposition bringing about the accomplishment of the Three Rare and Sublime Ones, constituting the cause and the conditions that give rise to this fruit. Their actual cor­rect meaning is the object of perception of the primordial wisdom of buddhas alone who directly see all the aspects of the knowable. Fur­thermore, as for the meaning of the element and so on, these four as­pects are inconceivable to ordinary beings. This is due to four reasons which will be explained in the next section according to the given se­quence [of the last four vajra points].B1L22.1.3. Explanation why they are inconceivable[The buddha element] is pure and yet has affliction. [Enlightenment] was not afflicted and yet is purified.Qualities are totally indivisible [and yet unapparent].[Activity] is spontaneous and yet without any thought."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"116 Buddha NatureOur nature of mind has been completely pure since beginningless time, and yet at the same time it has the affliction through the adven­titious defilements which are temporarily present. For this reason the meaning of the element is inconceivable.Previously, enlightenment was not afflicted at all by the adventi­tious defilements, and yet later it has become utterly purified from all defilements up to their very end through the cultivation of the path. For this reason the meaning of enlightenment is inconceivable.On one hand the absolute qualities exist in the true state, which is also completely indivisible during the phase of an ordinary being who is bound up with affliction. On the other hand, these qualities do not become apparent since their power does not unfold until buddhahood is reached. For this reason the meaning of the qualities is inconceivable.The activity of a buddha fulfils the wishes and hopes of the dis­ciples in correspondence to their respective karmic fortunes, and does so in a way that is free from deliberate effort, spontaneous, and at all times uninterrupted. Nevertheless it is completely free from thought and consideration, such as \"this or that needs to be done\" and so on. For this reason the meaning of activity is inconceivable.These [four points] are inconceivable, as seemingly two contradic­tory statements are made in relation to the same basis. In fact there is no contradiction: The element is a completely pure nature empty of the essence of the defilements. Its impurity consists of the fact that it has adventitious defilements.\"Previous freedom from defilements\" means that the defilements do not exist as the nature of the element. \"Later purity\" means that purification from the defilements is to be considered like gold being purified from the surrounding dross. Although there is an absence of purity during the phase of an ordinary being, whereas later complete purification from the defilements is achieved, this later purity is na­tive to the true state in a completely indivisible way. For this reason there is no contradiction.Since in the phase of an ordinary being there is no purification from the defilements, the qualities are not [apparently] present. Neverthe­less, when later purification from the defilements is achieved, [it proves that] the qualities exist in the true state in such a way that they are not able to be separated from it. This is similar to the following example: Though in the phase in which gold is not purified from the surround­ing dross there is no luster, later luster will manifest in an inseparable way. Therefore again there is no contradiction.Activity will be explained below in its own chapter by means of nine examples.

The qualities linked with enlightenment are the attributes of this realization. Activity is the power of these qualities causing all other [sentient beings] to real­ize this element as well. For this reason, the first of the four vajra points in their given sequence, that is, suchness bound up with pollution, is the cause to be purified. This is because the Three Rare and Sublime Ones arise from the fact that this suchness has been completely puri­fied from any defilement.

With regard to suchness or the true state of the entirety of samsara and nirvana, there is not the slightest differentiation.

The first is the dharmakaya. This is the real Tathagata, whereas the nature of beings is only named after it. Since it is able to be attained by beings, it is explained as being all-pervasive. The second is the real nature of both a Tathagata and beings. When merely considered from the aspect of suchness being by nature completely pure, the sugatagarbha [or tathagatagarbha] is really present within a Tathagata and be­ings alike. The third is the real nature of beings. Since it is the cause of the Tathagata, it has been named after it.At this point the noble Asanga states [in his commentary]:In brief, there are three reasons for which all beings have the na­ture of the Tathagata. The Bhagavan has said: \"All beings have buddha nature, since buddha wisdom is always present within the assembly of beings, since this undefiled nature is free from duality and since the disposition to buddhahood has been named after its fruit.\" These three reasons have been taught extensively in all the words of the Buddha. With respect to this they are ex­plained as follows: due to the fact that the dharmakaya of the Tathagata embraces all beings, that the suchness of the Tathagata is completely indivisible and that they have the disposition of the Tathagata...In some commenting scriptures these lines do not appear. Yet they have been quoted and explained extensively by Golo (Tib.

These individuals are the basis for four types of veils that arise in their streams of being and are to be abandoned. These four veils are hostility towards the Mahayana Dharma, a view asserting the person and so on to be an existing self, desire for personal happiness and peace that results from fear of the suffering of samsara, and unconcern about the accomplishment of the"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 121welfare of fellow beings. In the given sequence [these correspond to the following individuals]: Firstly there is a correspondence to those who desire existence. These áre beings who have the disconnected disposition and beings of great desire who have definitely fallen into the cycle of existence. Secondly there is a correspondence to those who desire freedom from existence. These are the tirthikas [and so on] who desire freedom from existence but apply inappropriate means, and the shravakas and pratyekabuddhas who desire freedom from exist­ence and apply appropriate means. Due to [the presence of these indi­viduals] there are four types of veils preventing the immediate mani­festation of the tathagatagarbha. The first obscures the aspect of the purity of the dharmakaya. The second obscures the aspect of its being true self. The third obscures the aspect of its being true happiness, and the fourth obscures the aspect that the dharmakaya is of true perma­nence. The cause that purifies these veils consists of the four qualities of the path, which are outstanding devotion towards the sacred Dharma and so on, that is, the perfection of discriminative wisdom, immea­surable samadhi, and great compassion.

These are the seed of the king, his pure queen, the unimpaired abode of her womb, and the exceptional nurse who nourishes the child as he grows. Using this example it can be said that devotion towards the supreme vehicle is the seed of the Buddha. Discriminative wisdom that realizes the true nature of everything is like the mother, generating all buddha qualities. Since the happiness of meditative stability, such as \"the trea­sury of space\" and so on, augments these qualities, it is similar to the abode of the womb.

Put briefly, the fruit of these four [purifying] causes consists of four aspects: With regard to the dharmakaya, the children entertain a strong attachment in terms of the belief in purity, in the existence of a self, in happiness, and in permanence. Shravakas and pratyekabuddhas reverse these four as­pects of an exaggerated view [of a view wrongly asserting reality where it is not present]. In doing so they get attached to [their vision of] im­purity, non-existence of self, suffering, and impermanence. Tire four aspects of the [true] purity of dharmakaya and so on act as the rem­edies for this attachment. [The four purifying causes] are the means to bring about their perfection.

Thus it constitutes the perfection of purity.The conceptual elaboration consisting of the belief in the existence of a self as it is imputed by the tirthikas and so on, and the conceptual elaboration consisting of the belief in the non-existence of a self as it is imputed by the shravakas and so on, have been totally stilled and pacified without any remainder. Thus it is the perfection of true self.All suffering has been ceased without any exception. This is be­cause karma and the mental poisons have been totally eliminated, up to the point that [even] the skandhas, which are of mental nature, and their causes have been exhausted.

Thus the two benefits are uninterrupted and the dharmakaya constitutes the perfection of permanence.In this context the great omniscient Dolpopa has stated:Furthermore, since the absolute expanse is by nature completely pure, there is not even the slightest need to remove a fault in terms of the impermanence of samsara. Therefore it does not fall into the extreme of nihilism. Since it has been spontaneously present since beginningless time, there is not even the slightest need to add a quality in terms of the permanence of nirvana.

These consist of the fact that one relies on a saintly being, lives in a favorable place, has formerly practiced virtue, and makes genuine and pure wishing prayers. With regard to samsara and nirvana, or to existence and peace, such an individual sees them for what they are. He per­ceives their respective fault and quality and sees that suffering is the fault of samsara and that happiness is the quality of nirvana. Upon seeing this, such a person feels weariness with the fault, which is the suffering of samsara, and joy over the quality, which is the happiness of nirvana. This weariness and joy arise from the presence of the dis­position to buddhahood. One might wonder for what reason this can be said. The reason is that this understanding of what is to be adopted and what is to be rejected will not be present in someone who is subject to craving for what is wrong and does not have the awakened disposi­tion. Such a person does not see the respective fault and quality of existence and peace until he has developed devotion towards the teach­ing of one of the three vehicles, depending upon which of these is suitable for this particular person. In this context [the root text speaks of there being no disposition]. Since it is impossible that the naturally present disposition is not there, this explanation is rather [to be un­derstood] by means of the different kinds of disposition, and it seems that by the term \"non-present disposition\" the unawakened disposi­tion is taught.

Since ordinary beings who are children [in comparison to noble ones] believe in permanence, it manifests as a perverted or wrong sense-perception, as a wrong way of thinking, and as wrong views. Noble ones who follow [the path of] practice and thus see the Four [Noble] Truths have reversed this distortion. In them it manifests in the manner that the firm belief in permanence is aban­doned. A tathagata has abandoned the two veils. Therefore it mani­fests as it is, in accordance with reality, in an unperverted way, and as freedom from any conceptual elaboration. In this way the individuals who constitute the basis divide into three different kinds. Accordingly, suchness or the dharmadhatu, which is supported by this basis, also gains three different aspects. It should be noted that the topic \"mani­festation\" will be explained below in yet another manner by means of four aspects. (See also Part Three, annotation 32.)B.JJ.2.2.2.L2.2.5.

The utterly purified phase is the one in which the tathagatagarbha is completely purified from the two veils. These three phases are expressed and explained by means of three different names, which are \"being,\" \"bodhisattva,\" and \"tathagata.\" Considering the fact that there are three different ways of manifestation, one might wonder whether there are different kinds of suchness.

Therefore this dharmadhatu pervades all phases. It equally permeates the phase of an ordinary being who is beset with faults, the phase of a bodhisattva who has qualities, and the phase of a tathagata in whom the qualities are ultimate. Taking an example, this is similar to the way in which space pervades everything visible, permeating a visible object of inferior appearance, such as a vessel made of clay, in the same way as one of average appearance, such as a vessel made of copper, and one of supreme appearance, such as a ves­sel made of gold."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"130 Buddha NatureB.11.2.2.2.1.2.2.7.

Explanation of the difference as far as the accom­plishment of the tzuo benefits is concernedThe way the bodhisattvas [unfold activity] in the post-meditative phase equals the tathagatas' [action] in the world for beings' true liberation.Though this is true, indeed, whatever difference lies between the earth and an atom or else between [the water in] the sea and in an ox's hoofprint, is the difference between a buddha and a bodhisattva.The way in which a bodhisattva who dwells on the tenth bodhi­sattva level engages in activity equals that of all tathagatas who em­body ultimate abandonment and realization. With respect to leading others to complete maturation in the post-meditative phase they are equal. Such a bodhisattva has attained the particular qualities of the six types of clairvoyance, of the ten kinds of mastery (Tib. dbang bcu), and so forth. Therefore he also acts in the world spontaneously and without deliberate effort in order to truly liberate all sentient beings who have become disciples from samsara's ocean of suffering. Though it is true indeed that such a bodhisattva is like a buddha as far as the [fulfillment of] others' benefit is concerned, there is an extremely great difference with respect to personal benefit, which consists of the quali­ties of abandonment and realization. Consider, for example, the dif­ference between the great globe of the earth and an atom, or between the amount of water contained in the large ocean and in the hoofprint of an ox. In this measure, the difference between the ultimate qualities of a perfect buddha and the qualities of the path of a bodhisattva who dwells on the tenth bodhisattva level is extremely great.The way reference is made here to the bodhisattva levels corresponds to the way in which the omniscient Dolpopa has clearly elucidated the intended meaning of Asanga's great commentary. On the other hand the omniscient Rangjung Dorje [the third Karmapa]'makes a slight difference.

It does not change into something else in the sense of one physical form being abandoned to be replaced by an­other. This is because, even in the expanse of the nirvana free from any remainder of skandhas, it possesses immeasurable properties, these being the inexhaustible absolute qualities. Likewise it has the attribute of steadfastness (Tib. brtan). It is the supreme refuge of all sentient beings, unfailing and undeceptive. This is because it possesses qualities protecting them without any limit of time, until the final end, as long as samsara may last. This undefiled dharmadhatu has the at­tribute of peace (Tib. zhi). It is always free from the duality of samsara and nirvana. This is because it is without any ideation as to the pun­ishment and comfort represented by these.

Likewise the two sentences \"It is the refuge of beings...\" and \"Steadfast it does not die...\" refer to the attribute of steadfastness. The two sentences \"It is always free from"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 143duality.. and \"Since it is peace...\" refer to the attribute of peace, and the two sentences \"It is also an indestructible state...\" and \"Since it is immutable...\" refer to the attribute of immutability. In the same sequence in which these four attributes are given in the foregoing sec­tions, the true state, the expanse not created by causes and conditions, is to be known from the sutras [teaching the meaning of buddha na­ture] as being permanent and so on, that is, permanent, steadfast, peace­ful, and immutable.B.//.2.2.2.2.2.2.7.2.3.2.3. Explanation of the reason for its establishment as being permanent and so forthSince it is endowed with inexhaustible qualities, [the dharmakaya]is unchangingness itself and thus [has] the attribute of permanence.Equaling the uttermost end it is refuge itself and thus [holds] the attribute of steadfastness.Since absence of thought is its nature, it is dharmata free from duality and thus [has] the attribute of peace.Hosting uncreated qualities, it is immutability itself and thus [possesses] the attribute of indestructibility.Even in the expanse of the nirvana without remainder, this dharma­kaya by nature completely pure is endowed with an endless number of inexhaustible qualities. Therefore, not undergoing the slightest trans­formation into something else, it is unchangingness itself and thus pos­sesses the attribute of permanence. It is protective and uninterrupted in a way that equals the uttermost end of samsara. Therefore it is refuge itself forever unfailing and thus possesses the attribute of steadfast­ness. Its nature is absence of thought. There is no ideation in terms of the two extremes. Therefore it is the dharmata, the true state free from the duality of existence and [mere] peace, and thus possesses the at­tribute of [true] peace. It has qualities that are not created, that are not an artifice brought about by causes and conditions. Therefore it is last­ingly indestructible and thus possesses the attribute of immutability.iu*>B.II.2.2.2.1.2.2.8. Inseparability of the qualities B.I1.2.2.2.12.2.8.1.

The svabhavikakaya is therefore stated as being equivalent to nirvana. And again, the absolute qualities such as the ten powers and so forth are completely inseparable.

This dharmadhatu has been by nature utterly pure since beginningless time and the adventitious defilements have been totally pacified up to their very end.

Detailed explanation of their essential meaning B M 2 2 2 1 2 2 .8 2 2 1 . Detailed explanation of the fact [that a buddha and nirvana] are no differentDirect perfect enlightenment [with regard to] all aspects, and abandonment of the stains along with their imprints [are called] buddha and nirvana respectively.In truth, these are not two different things.All aspects of the knowable—all absolute and relative phenomena— are directly known. Through this knowledge one is immediately and perfectly enlightened. This is the aspect of realization. All the adventi­tious defilements—the two veils along with their remaining imprints— are abandoned without any exception. This is the aspect of abandon­ment. These two qualities have been led to ultimate perfection. They are therefore named \"perfect buddha\" [\"perfectly awakened and ex­panded\"] from the viewpoint of the former aspect, and \"nirvana\" [\"gone beyond any torment and pain\"] from the viewpoint of the lat­ter aspect. These two aspects are contained in one and the same mean­ing, the meaning of the tathagatagarbha, whereas a difference only lies in the convention of the different terms. In the sense of the abso­lute field of experience of the noble ones' primordial wisdom the quali­ties of realization and abandonment are therefore completely insepa­rable and do not exist as two different things.B .U 222.122.8222. Detailed explanation of the meaning of liberationLiberation is distinguished by indivisibility from qualities present in all their aspects: innumerable, inconceivable, and unpolluted.Such liberation is [also called] \"tathagata.\"Since the qualities are not incomplete, all aspects are fully present.

Since one cannot fathom their number and inherent power, they are"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"146 Buddha Natureinconceivable. Since the two veils along with the remaining imprints are eliminated, they are unpolluted. The dharmakaya has the charac­teristic of being inseparable from these four qualifications. The fact that this dharmakaya has become directly manifest is called ultimate nirvana, or in other words, liberation. In the light of the fact that suchness (Skt. tathata) is directly realized, such true qualified libera­tion (Tib. tharpa mtshan nyid pa) is also called \"tathagata.\"B.IL222.122.82.3. Detailed explanation of these by means of examples B.U222.122.82.3.1. The fictitious example of the painters B .U 222122.82.3.11. ExampleSuppose some painters mastered their craft, each with respect to a different [part of the body], so that whichever part one would know how to do, he would not succeed with any other part.Then the king, the ruler of the country, hands them a canvas and gives the order:\"You all together paint my image on this!\"Having heard this [order] from the [king] they carefully take up their painting work.While they are well immersed in their task, one among them leaves for another country.Since they are incomplete due to his travel abroad, their painting in all its parts does not get fully perfected.Thus the example is given.The cause through which one accomplishes the four qualities men­tioned above is primordial wisdom realizing emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects (Tib. mam k m mchog Man gyi stongpa nyid). There­fore this primordial wisdom is taught by means of the example of the painters as given in the Ratnacudasutra (Tib. rin chen gyis zhus pa'i mdo). The example is as follows:Suppose there is a gathering of many painters, each of whom is highly specialized and has mastered his craft with respect to a different part of the body, such as the head and so forth. Whichever part of the body one of them knows how to do, he will not succeed with any other part.

In their given se­quence they illuminate, radiate, and purify, and these three [aspects] are not separate from each other.

These are the remaining imprints of desire, aversion, and ignorance, which is mental blindness with re­spect to thatness.The fourth aspect provides the condition of virtuous and unvirtuous karma. It consists of the fiercely active state of these three poisons, the state in which they immediately manifest. These three are presented as one aspect."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The fifth aspect provides the condition producing a body of mental nature.

Only their elimination generates the pure [bodhi- sattva] levels.The ninth aspect comprises the defilements based upon the stream of being of an individual dwelling on one of the pure [bodhisattva] levels. Their elimination generates the end of the continuum.In their given sequence these nine aspects are fully and thoroughly explained by the nine examples of the shroud of the lotus, the bees, and the following [seven].When the shroud of the secondary mental poisons that obscure the element is fully classified in terms of subject matter, there are eighty- four thousand different major types, which in their turn split up into ever further kinds. This process is beyond any end and corresponds to the different kinds of primordial wisdom of a tathagata, which are similarly endless in number.The lines starting with \"But when it is comprised concisely...\" and ending with \"... and the subsequent examples,\" have been elucidated in the foregoing sections and are easily comprehended from the words of [Asanga's] commentary.B.ll.2.2.2.1.3.3.2.

Yet later, without a long time passing, it changes and becomes faded and undelightful. The dormant tendencies of the mental poison of desire are similar to this. When greed bom from improper mental activity directly manifests, joy and delight are present. When later it ceases, there is no longer any delight. This greed is therefore said to be simi­lar to the delight upon seeing the lotus, while the dormant tendencies of desire are similar to the lotus [itself]."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 165Bees are attached to their honey. When someone else takes the honey away, their minds are extremely agitated by anger. They fiercely at­tack and sting this person, causing a burning pain.

Thus the dormant tendencies of hatred are said to be similar to bees.The kernels of rice and other grains cannot be seen since they are concealed by their husks, by the beards and different layers of skin. Likewise the vision of the meaning of the tathagatagarbha, of the dharmadhatu, which is by nature clear light, is also obscured by the dormant tendencies of mental blindness, of ignorance, and so on, which are similar to an eggshell. Thus they cause it not to be seen. In this way the dormant tendencies of mental blindness are said to be similar to the husk.B.11.22213332. The defect of their fiercely active state Filth is repugnant.Being the cause for those bound up with greedto indulge in sense pleasures,the active state [of the poisons] resembles it.Filthy and rotten things belong to the repugnant part. They involve danger, and are to be feared. The state in which the three poisons rise up and become directly manifest is the cause for beings in the desire realm who are bound up with greed to get immersed in many forms of evil conduct, to indulge in sense pleasures and pursue various other inferior aims.

This is the tathagatagarbha, the dharmadhatu, which is utterly free from defilement and by nature clear light. It exists as the field of experience of the self-aware primor­dial wisdom of all buddhas. The imputed aspect is the dharmakaya in the sense of teaching. This is the cause conducive to the attainment or realization of this actual or real dharmakaya. It consists of the teach­ings of the words of the Buddha, from which true awareness will emerge in accordance with the respective karmic fortunes of the dis­ciples. These two aspects are classified in terms of the object to be expressed and the means of expression, or in other words, in terms of fruit and cause.When the dharmakaya in the sense of teaching is categorized into an internal classification, there are also two aspects: The first is teach­ing in the way of the deep Dharma.

Explanation of the way the three kayas are attainedfrom theseThe attainment of the three kayas of a buddha is seen to stem from the twofold disposition.By the first aspect there is the first [kaya], through the second there are the latter two.The attainment of the three kayas of a perfect buddha is seen as the fruit stemming from the twofold disposition. These are the disposi­tion in terms of the nature and the expanded disposition acting as the cause of the three kayas.(1) Once the numerous accumulations of primordial wisdom have been led to final perfection, the disposition that exists as the nature will have become free from all the adventitious stains without any remainder. Through this the first kaya is attained. This is the svabhavi- kakaya, the true state possessing the two types of purity.(2) Through final perfection of the accumulation of merit, the dis­position that is expanded has room to unfold. Due to this, the latter two kayas are attained. These are the sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya, which appear to the near and distant disciples, respectively.In this context the venerable Karma Thrinlàpa states the following:Nowadays most of those who interpret the five Dharmas of Maitreya hold that the expanded disposition is compounded, in that it has come about through causes and conditions. As a proof they quote the above statement [which is also contained in the Mahayanasutralamkara (Tib. mdosde rgyan)\\. \"it has become supreme [through] right cultivation\" (B.II.2.2.2.1.3.4.3.3.1). On this basis they say: \"The disposition that is expanded is the proper cultivation of the roots of virtue.\" This can only be considered as an assertion comparable to the noise of the rabbit."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"172 Buddha NatureThe glorious Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje said in The Pro­found Inner Meaning (Tib. zab mo nang don): \"Moreover, when some think that the expanded disposition is newly arisen, this is not the case...\" This quote, as well as further statements he made, corre­sponds in content to this present text. It is therefore not held here that the expanded disposition consists of the proper cultivation of the roots of virtue. On the contrary, it has been present since beginningless time. Yet, in the phase of an ordinary being it is obscured by the veils so that complete maturation and activity cannot unfold. Therefore it lacks the ability to accomplish the ben­efit of sentient beings to a large extent. The [inherent] ability of this disposition unfolds, though, when the roots cf virtue that form the accumulation of merit are properly cultivated on the path of training. For this reason, once the veils are purified, the activity of the form kayas, which are adorned with the thirty-two qualities of complete maturation, unfolds in the phase of a buddha. This is expressed in the passage: \"it has become supreme [through] right cultivation.\" This passage corresponds in content to the passage: \"Similar to...the fruit of a tree\" (B.II.2.2.2.1.3.4.3.3.1) and to the passage further above: \"The seed contained in the fruit of a mango or similar trees\" (B.II.2.2.2.1.3.2.2.6.1). If with regard to this fact one sees the necessity to claim that this disposition [as it is ex­plained in the context of the nine examples and their respective meanings by means of the example of the fruit-skin and the shoot] is the proper cultivation of the roots of virtue, this is, I think, an exaggerated interpretation.(See also Part Four, note 8.)B.11.2.2.2.1.3A.3.3.3. Combination of these with their examplesThe beautiful svabhavikakaya is like the statue of precious material, since [it exists] naturally, is not created, and is a treasure of gem-like qualities.W ielding the sublime majesty of the Great Dharma, the sambhoga[kaya] resembles the Chakravartin.Being of the nature of a [mere] representation, the nirmana[kaya] is similar to the golden image.The svabhavikakaya, which is the absolute kaya, is by nature clear light and is supremely beautiful due to the glory of its qualities. It should be known as being similar to the statue of the Buddha made from precious material, since it has naturally existed since beginning­less time. It is not newly created by means of deliberate effort and it has qualities, the powers and so on, similar to an inexhaustible trea­sure of gems."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 173The sambhogakaya [the kaya of perfect enjoyment], which appears to beings of pure vision, wields the sublime glory of the majesty of the Mahayana Dharma in its deep and vast aspects.

(See also Part Four, note 9.)The nirmanakaya, which appears to all sentient beings in common, is like the golden image. Because of the power resulting from the real­ization of the absolute kaya, it has the effect or nature of appearing to the minds of the disciples as a mere representation of whatever form is suitable to train any of them.B.II.2.2.2.1.3A.3A. The way these are to be realized through faithThis truth of the Self-Sprung Ones is to be realized through faith.The orb of the sun blazes with light,[but] is not seen by the blind.This true nature of all self-sprung buddhas, who have not come about through conditions but have been spontaneously present from the very beginning, is within all sentient beings. Nevertheless ordi­nary beings, shravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and those bodhisattvas who have newly entered [the path] do not realize it directly, as it is. Relying on the trustworthy words of the Buddha they [first] have to realize it in a general way by means of faith, devotion, and finally firm convic­tion. This is similar to the example of the orb of the sun, which blazing with light is still not seen by the blind.B.IL2.2.2.1.3.5. Explanation of the very nature itself B.1I.2.2.2.1.3.5.1.

The perceiving subject is the au­thentic discriminative wisdom, which knows the absolute. Through looking directly at this true dharmadhatu by means of this discrimi­native wisdom, and through resting within it in meditative equipoise, one will become supremely familiar with it, and primordial wisdom, which directly sees the authentic meaning of the actual true state, will gradually arise. Through this [seeing] one attains complete liberation from the adventitious stains that are to be abandoned. [First] one will be completely freed from the stains to be abandoned through seeing on the path of seeing. [Subsequently] one will be completely freed from the stains to be abandoned through meditation on the path of meditation.

The way it is empty and not emptyThe element is empty of the adventitious [stains], which are featured by their total separateness.But it is not empty of the matchless properties, which are featured by their total inseparability.The true nature of mind is free from there being anything to be re­moved or added, and thus is devoid of extremes.This element is empty of the adventitious stains, which have the feature of being totally separate from it, along with the fact that they are able to be removed. For this reason the element is free from the extreme of assertion or overstatement (Tib. sgro 'dogs) in the sense of [falsely] stating existence.Yet, this element is not empty of the powers and so on, the unsur­passable properties or qualities, which have the feature of being to­tally inseparable from it and thus are not able to be removed. For this reason the element is free from the extreme of denial or understate­ment (Tib. skur 'debs) in the sense of [falsely] stating non-existence.Since the simultaneous presence [of existence and non-existence] is a contradiction, it is also freed from the extreme of there being both existence and non-existence."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lions Roar 175Since this is so, it is also freed from the extreme of there being nei­ther of these two that have been refuted, of there being neither exist­ence nor non-existence.For this reason it is completely freed from the two extremes, or in other words, from the four extreme views. This complete freedom from the four extreme views is the way unperverted emptiness is. This is thatness [the simple state of everything].B.II222.1A. The necessity to explain the element B.1I222.1A.1. Short explanation of question and anszoer B.1I222.1A.1.1. Question[The sutras of the second turning of the wheel of Dharma] state in numerous places that all knowable [phenomena] are in all ways empty like a cloud, a dream, or an illusion.Why is it then, that in [the sutras of the third turning of the wheel of Dharma] the Buddha, having said this, declared that buddha nature is present within beings?In the transition to the following verses it is said in [Asanga's] com­mentary:The element being so difficult to see that it is not [even] the object of experience of the supreme noble ones who dwell on the level where freedom from attachment is finally perfected, one may wonder why its presence was taught to the children.This question is implicitly contained in the section commented here. The literal question is as follows: It is said in numerous places in the great, the middling, and the other prajnaparamitasutras, in which on the occasion of the second turning of the wheel of Dharma the teach­ing on the absence of characteristics was expounded:... Appearance, but not true and devoid of entity like a cloud, a dream, or an illusion; thus all knowable phenomena starting from form up to omniscience appear, but are empty in all ways and devoid of entity, without the slightest exception.Why is it then, that after having extensively taught this, the Buddha taught on the occasion of the third turning of the wheel of Dharma in numerous lectures, the tathagatagarbhasutras, and so on, which finally identify the absolute: \"Buddha nature, the dharmadhatu, which is by nature completely pure and luminous clarity, has been spontaneously"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"176 Buddha Naturepresent within all sentient beings since beginningless time\"?

They explain the necessity for which the presence of buddha nature is taught in the tathagatagarbhasutras and so on.The teaching that buddha nature is present within every sentient being is necessary, since the Buddha has given it in order to persuade those who have any of the following five faults to abandon these: The first of these faults is faintheartedness, which hinders one from exert­ing effort and striving for enlightenment. The second is contempt for \"inferior beings,\" which hinders one from [developing] love and com­passion for others. The third is distorted perception, which comes about through not perceiving an object in its true way of existence. The fourth is disparaging the true nature [by] denying the existence of the sugata- garbha, and the fifth is exceeding self-cherishing and attachment to oneself.B 1 I2 2 2 1 A 2.

With the words \"like a cloud and so on\" they are said to be like a cloud, a dream appearance, an illusion, or a deceptive apparition.B.11222.1A2.12. Detailed explanationThe mental poisons are like a cloud.Karma resembles a dream experience.The skandhas produced by the poisons and karma are similar to an illusion or a deceptive apparition.The omnipresent afflictions of desire and the other mental poisons are like a cloud, since they pervade the sky-like nature of mind and since they are adventitious. The omnipresent affliction of karma, unvirtuous action, and so on, which is fully activated by attachment and so forth, is similar to a dream experience. This is because it is generated by a distorted understanding and [thus] is a deluded imagi­nation. The omnipresent affliction of birth is due to the skandhas and so on, which are the fruit of the full ripening of karma and mental poisons. This is similar to an illusion or a deceptive apparition, since it depends upon conditions and is not real.B .U 222.1A 22. The reason for the teaching of the third turning of the wheel of DharmaFor the time being it was thus expounded.Additionally in this unsurpassable continuity it was then taught: \"The element is present,\" so that the five evils would be abandoned.[The teachings of the three turnings of the wheel of Dharma were given] in order to guide the disciples gradually. With respect to the first turning of the wheel of Dharma, which consists of the teachings on the Four Noble Truths, some might think that form and so on are truly existent. In order to cause the abandonment of this attachment to the immediate semblance, the Buddha said for the time being, on the occasion of the second turning of the wheel of Dharma, which expresses the absence of characteristics: \"All phenomena are empti­ness, appearance but devoid of entity, like a cloud, a dream, or an illusion.\" Thus he gave an explanation that mainly and almost exclu­sively teaches the absence of an existing essence. Without abandoning his explanation that solely elucidates this [essencelessness], he then additionally gave the cycle of teachings pertaining to the highest or"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"178 Buddha Naturethe last of the three turnings of the wheel of Dharma, which finally defines the absolute. He did so in order to demonstrate the deepest aspect. His aim was to cause the abandonment of the five evils of faint­heartedness and so on and the subsequent attainment of qualities such as delight in the Dharma and so forth. With this intention he said here in the context of the explanation of the ultimate, which is comparable to a continuity, since the uninterrupted dharmadhatu is taught: \"This element that is by nature completely pure, the tathagatagarbha, is all- pervasively present within all [sentient beings].\" And he explained this extremely clearly by means of a vast number of examples, rea­sons, and so forth.B.ll.2.2.2.1.4.2.3. Detailed explanation of this reason B.ll.2.22.1.4.2.3.1. The way the five evils come aboutAs long as they have not heard this, bodhichitta will not be born in those whose minds are feeble and fainthearted, stirred by the evil of self-contempt.Having engendered [a little] bodhichitta, some proudly imagine: \"I am supreme!\"Towards those who have not developed it they are imbued with notions of inferiority.In those who entertain such thoughts, true understanding will not arise.They hold the untrue [to be true] and thus will not realize the truth.Being artificially produced and adventitious, these faults of beings are not truly [existent].In truth these evils do not exist as self, but exist as the qualities by nature pure.While they hold the evils, which are untrue, [to be true] and disparage the true qualities, [denying their presence,] even those of understanding will not attain the love that perceives the similarity of oneself and others.If the Buddha had not taught: \"This buddha nature is all-pervasively present within all beings\" and one could therefore not hear this teach­ing, there would be the following consequences. As long as sentient beings have not heard this, five faults will arise within them:Some individuals' minds are feeble and fainthearted because of the evil of self-contempt and lack of drive, so that they think: \"How could someone like me attain unsurpassable enlightenment?\" Special"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 179bodhichitta expresses itself in the wish: \"May the true Buddha, which is my own nature, reveal itself!\" In those beings this special bodhichitta will not be born.Bodhichitta consists of the wish: \"May I accomplish buddhahood for the sake of the others!\" Some, through having developed this only a little bit, get arrogant and conceited so that they imagine: \"I follow the Great Vehicle! Therefore I am extraordinary and supreme!\" To­wards other beings who have not engendered bodhichitta they are imbued with the notion: \"These are inferior!\" This is due to their igno­rance of the fact that suchness is present in these other beings as well.In those individuals who entertain such thoughts, who believe that buddha nature does not exist, true understanding free from assertion and denial will not arise. Therefore they fall into the evil of overstate­ment and hold what is not true—the relative, adventitious stains—to be truly existent.On the other hand they also fall into the evil of understatement. They will not realize that the dharmadhatu, which contains the abso­lute qualities, is spontaneously present. In this way they do not real­ize the truth. Thoroughly analyzing, one finds that these faults of be­ings are artificially produced by causes and conditions and are adven­titious, being able to be removed. These adventitious stains are there­fore not truly existent. In truth these adventitious evils, since they do not exist in terms of a self of the person or a self of phenomena, exist as the powers and so on, as the absolute qualities that are by nature completely pure.When one falls to assertion or denial, believing that the adventi­tious evils, which are not the truth, exist as the nature, or believing that the dharmadhatu, which contains the true qualities, has not been spontaneously present since beginningless time, the evil of exceeding self-cherishing and attachment to oneself will arise. Thus not even bodhisattvas possessing understanding will attain the great love that sees oneself and all sentient beings as having the same nature, as be­ing equally the absolute buddha.Therefore the dharmadhatu has been clearly elucidated in order to cause the abandonment of these evils.In this context the venerable Mikyo Dorje [the eighth Karmapa] has said:Here some Tibetan scholars consider the words in the Mahayana Uttara Tantra Shastra: \"The tatagathagarbha is present within all beings\" as a statement requiring interpretation, inasmuch as to"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"180 Buddha Naturetheir opinion this was only said in order to eliminate the five faults.If this was so, it would follow that there would be no need to eliminate the five faults. It would also not be a fault to have con­tempt for inferior beings. The tathagatagarbha would not be present within sentient beings. There would be no need to take the teachings on the tathagatagarbha as being a valid truth. This would be a statement requiring interpretation. To deny the exist­ence of the sugatagarbha as dharmakaya would also not be a fault, but a correct statement expressing the actual way of existence, since with regard to something that never existed one cannot fall into the extreme of understatement. Also faintheartedness would be justified, since no sugatagarbha would be present in one's own stream of being and a teaching aimed against faintheartedness would therefore be a statement that does not correspond to real­ity. Further, it follows from this opinion that the noble Asanga, for instance, was not a person of authority, since in his system he would not present the holy teachings of the Buddha, of Maitreya, and so on, which \"have been given for a specific purpose and when taken literally lead to contradiction,\" as a statement that is \"not to be understood in the literal sense.\" Since we find ourselves unable to follow those who are capable of walking over the Pro­tector Asanga, we will follow the Noble One himself.B.IL222.1A 2.32. The way qualities are attained once the five evils are abandonedOnce one has heard this, joy will be bom.Respect as towards the Buddha, analytical wisdom, primordial wisdom, and great love will arise.Through the arising of these five qualities, one is rid of the faults and sees similarity.[By realizing] the absence of defects and the presence of qualities,and through love, [seeing] the equality of oneself and [all] beings,buddhahood will be quickly attained.Through the fact that in the context of the Buddha's words contain­ing the definitive meaning (Tib. nges don, Skt. nitdrtha), it is said that \"the dharmadhatu of the Tathagata is all-pervasively present within all beings,\" and through the disciples having thoroughly heard this, [five qualities will arise]:Through the notion, \"direct revelation of my own nature is great enlightenment,\" joy and willingness towards the hardships and bur­dens of the path will be bom."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 181Through knowing that the nature of others is also buddha, the re­spect one has for one's teacher will equally arise towards anyone else.With regard to the relative, adventitious stains, which do not exist in terms of the two aspects of self, the discriminative wisdom know­ing them to be non-existent arises.With regard to the absolute dharmadhatu, which exists in terms of the nature, the primordial wisdom knowing it to be existent arises.Through seeing one's own nature and that of others equally as buddha, great love, which wishes to do others good, is born.Since in this way five qualities arise, this results in the benefit that one is free from the defects of faintheartedness and so on and sees buddha nature to be equally present within all.Through the realization that the faults, the adventitious stains, do not exist, whereas the naturally pure qualities exist and everyone has them, and through the great love seeing the equality of oneself and all beings in that all have the tatagathagarbha, one will gradually accom­plish the path.

The meaning of the stainsBy nature not existent, pervasive, and adventitious, the veils of the poisons and of the hindrances to knowledge are described as being similar to a cloud.Since beginningless time the stains by their very nature have never been truly existent. In the unpurified phase they pervade everything, and they are adventitious since they are able to be removed. For these three reasons the veil of the mental poisons, which constitutes the obstacle to liberation, and the veil of the hindrances to knowledge, which constitutes the obstacle to omniscience, are said to be similar to a cloud. Just as a cloud veils the sun and the sky, these two veils ob­scure the nature of clear light in the phase of ordinary beings. (See also Part Three, annotation 55.)B .H 2222.312.4. The cause by which one becomes free from these [veils]Twofold wisdom causes release from the two veils.Since there is the one that is free from ideation and the one ensuing from this in post-meditation, it is held that there are [two] primordial wisdoms.Through freeing oneself from the two veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge, the vimuktikaya (Tib. mam par grol ba'i sku, \"the kaya of complete liberation\") and the dharmakaya (Tib. chos kyi sku, \"the kaya of qualities\") are directly revealed.

In the post- meditative phase ensuing from [meditative equipoise], they cultivate the primordial wisdom that fully and thoroughly discriminates all ob­jects of knowledge, as many as there are, in their deep and vast aspects, and so on. This cultivation mainly purifies the veil of the hindrances to knowledge. For this reason these are considered as being two primor­dial wisdoms.

Since it is the abode of all unstained [lit. \"white\"] properties, it also finally perfects the benefit of others. A buddha who has gone into the very essence of suchness, into the true state itself, is similar to uncreated space. The own essence of space is not such that it fulfils a function, and yet it unfolds activity, providing the prerequisite for visible ob­jects to be seen and so forth. Similar to that, a buddha acts as a cause with respect to the six sense-faculties of a saintly being who has karmic fortune.

This perception occurs through the power of having previously gathered the accumulations. The objects perceived are non-arisings in that they are not made from the elements. One beholds [pure] physical form, hears the good and pure speech of the Mahayana Dharma, smells the pure scent of the moral conduct of the Sugata, and tastes the flavor of the nectar of the sacred Dharma that is the object of experience of the great noble ones. Through samadhi one attains suppleness or malleability (Tib. shin sbyangs).

Yet, as for the meaning it is better to translate it as \"wielding power,\" having in view the point of its taking form, which is equivalent to wielding or being possessed of power.(See also Part Three, annotation 59.)B.11222233.2. Detailed explanation of the meaning B.1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 2 1 . Explanation of the way the two benefits are accomplished,combined with their respective classificationIn brief, [two kayas] are to be understood as functions of the two primordial wisdoms: the vimuktikaya [representing] perfection, and the dharmakaya [representing] refinement.Vimuktikaya and dharmakaya are to be known in terms of two aspects and [a common] one, as they are free from pollution and all-pervasive, uncreated and thus embody the ground [of virtue].Briefly speaking, the functioning of the two kayas is to be under­stood as the function of the two primordial wisdoms, which are present on the path of training during meditative equipoise and during the post-meditative phase, respectively.During meditative equipoise one contemplates [the true nature] as it is [and thus gains correct knowledge]. Through this contemplation one perfectly attains final ultimate abandonment. This is equivalent to the vimuktikaya, the kaya in terms of being completely liberated from anything to be abandoned. During the post-meditative phase one trains oneself in an unperverted way with regard to the manner in which [anything relative], as much as there is, exists [and thus gains complete knowledge]. Through this training one fully refines final ultimate realization. This is equivalent to the dharmakaya.In this context the kaya in terms of complete liberation from the veils and the dharmakaya, which is the support of primordial wis­dom, are each to be known as having an individual aspect, namely192 Buddha Nature"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 193the two aspects of freedom from pollution and all-pervasiveness, re­spectively. They are further to be known as having one [common] as­pect in that they are both uncreated. This is because the vimuktikaya is free from even the slightest pollution and thus has [the aspect of abandonment], and the dharmakaya pervades all objects of knowl­edge without any remainder and thus has [the aspect of] realization. Their common aspect is due to the fact that they are both of a nature that is not created by causes and conditions. It is taught that these constitute the best possible benefit for oneself. Since they are the abode [of all virtue], of all unstained [lit. \"white\"] properties, they also pro­vide the best possible benefit for others.B. J/.2.2.2.2.3.3.2.2. Particular explanation of the best possible benefit for oneselfSince the mental poisons along with their remaining imprints are ended,[the vimuktikaya] is free from any pollution.Since there is no attachment and obstruction,[the dharmakaya] is considered as pervasive primordial wisdom.Being of a nature forever indestructible [neither kaya] is something that is created.While \"indestructibility\" is the [concise] explanation [of uncreatedness], it is taught in more detail through [the topic] \"steadfast\" and so forth.\"Destructibility\" is to be understood [in terms of] four aspects, since it constitutes the contrary of \"steadfastness\" and so on.These are decay, drastic change, being cut-off, and transmigration,which is inconceivable [and] a transformation [in various] ways. Since [the vimuktikaya and dharmakaya] are free from these [features],they are to be known as steadfast, peaceful, permanent, and unchanging.Since all the adventitious mental poisons along with their remain­ing imprints are ended, having been eliminated without exception at their very root, the vimuktikaya has the aspect of being free from any pollution. Likewise the dharmakaya is considered as having the as­pect of pervading the full range of the knowable, as much as there is, by means of the realization of primordial wisdom. This is equivalent to correct and complete knowledge. Correct knowledge results from the fact that perverted perception has been exhausted; hence there is"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"194 Buddha Natureno attachment and fixation to objects. Since all aspects [of the relative world] have become apparent, there is no hindrance with regard to objects [of perception]. Thus there is complete knowledge. Further­more, both kayas have the aspect of not being created by causes and conditions in their own right. For this reason they are of a nature that is forever indestructible, or in other words, unchanging. In this con­text their indestructibility is briefly explained by means of the reason of their uncreatedness. \"Indestructibility\" is then taught in detail through the four topics of steadfastness and so forth, the latter [three] being peace, permanence, and unchangingness.Then, if these are analyzed from the viewpoint of their opposite sides, all created or composite things are found to be subject to four ways of destruction for the following reasons: Contrary to being stead­fast they are not stable; contrary to being at peace they are unpeaceful; contrary to being permanent they are impermanent; and contrary to being unchanging they are subject to manifold changes.One may wonder in what way they are mutable. Mutability has four aspects: Reaching the point when they are fully ripened, all com­pounded things become rotten and old; this is the process of aging, which is equivalent to putrefaction and decay. The elements undergo a total change; this is the aspect of sickness, which consists of suffer­ing. The course of the previous existence is cut and the following one is achieved; this is the aspect of being bom. Then there is the process of dying; this implies a change that is inconceivable and takes place in manifold ways.Since with respect to the vimuktikaya and dharmakaya these four aspects of destruction are not present, in the same sequence they are to be considered as being the embodiment of steadfastness, peace, per­manence, and immutability.

Particular explanation of the best possible benefit for othersAs absence of pollution and [primordial] wisdom are the support for the unstained properties [to come forth in the disciples], they are [also] the abode [of the best possible benefit for others].Space is not a cause, and yet the cause for all visible things to be seen, for sound, odor, flavor, touch, and phenomena to be heard and so on.Just so, they cause the unstained qualities"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 195to arise as objects sensed by those [whose vision is] stable by junction with the unveiled [seeing of] the two kayas.Thus these aspects of abandonment and realization, which are free­dom from any pollution and primordial wisdom having revealed it­self directly, are the support or ground for the outstanding qualities, for the unstained properties of virtue, to come forth within the dis­ciples' streams of being in accordance with their respective karmic fortunes. For this reason they are also the abode of the best possible benefit of others.This can be shown by means of an example: Space does not consti­tute a cause that brings about any generation, and is devoid of the characteristics of the visible and so forth. Yet it is still established as being a cause in that it provides the prerequisite and opportunity for visible things to be seen by the sense faculty of the eye, for sounds to be heard by the ear, and so on—which is to say, for odors to be smelled by the nose, for flavors to be tasted by the tongue, for touches to be felt by the body, and for phenomena to be thought by the mind. In the same way, [the aspects of abandonment and realization] act as a cause: Cultivating the path of junction, one becomes free from the veils that prevent one from seeing the two buddhakayas. Through the cultiva­tion of this path one's understanding is profound and stable. The six sense-faculties of heirs of the Victorious One who are endowed with karmic fortune have become supreme by means of [this cultivation]. Thus their object of perception or field of experience is the dharma­kaya and the visible kayas. By the power of seeing the visible kayas, and so forth, the unpolluted qualities—such as the marks, signs, and so on—arise on the relative level. From seeing the dharmakaya, and so forth, the numberless unstained qualities—such as the powers, fear­lessnesses, and so on—will reveal themselves directly on the absolute level.

Similar to the example, all children without ex­ception have never before seen unpolluted suchness directly, not even to the slightest extent.

The visible kayas endowed with these three par­ticular properties are the nirmanakayas, which appear in various ways. They remain forever in this world as long as samsara lasts.

Detailed explanation of their meaning B.II.2.2.2.2.3.5.2.1 Common classificationThe Omniscience of All the Self-Sprung Ones is given the name of \"Buddhahood.\" Its meaning is [also termed]:\"Most Supremely Beyond Torment,\" \"The Inconceivable,\"\"Foe-Vanquisher,\" and \"Quintessence of Self-Awareness.\"When these are categorized, they can be fully divided into [three] properties, which are the qualities of depth, vastness, and greatness, or the nature [kaya] and so on.[The benefits] are fulfilled through these three kayas.Great enlightenment is self-sprung (Tib. rang byung) (1) in that it does not depend upon extraneous conditions. The Self-Sprung Ones [who have reached great enlightenment] are omniscient (2); they know all aspects of the knowable (Tib. shes bya thams cad mkhyen pa) and thus possess primordial wisdom. With respect to their having primordial wisdom, there are the aspects of best possible abandonment and real­ization. From the viewpoint of there being these aspects, the Omni­science of the Self-Sprung Ones is called Buddhahood (Tib. sangs rgyas nyid) [sangs rgyas means \"awakened and expanded\" and is explained as \"awakened from the sleep of ignorance and expanded with regard to the knowable,\" this being equivalent to the aspects of abandon­ment and realization, or correct and complete insight] (3). What this expresses is also called Supremely Beyond Torment, or Highest Nir­vana (Tib. mchog tu mnya ngan las 'das) (4), since great enlightenment does not abide within the two extremes of existence and peace. It is"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 20ccalled The Inconceivable (Tib. bsam du med pa) (5), since it is beyond any object of experience of reasoning and argumentation. It is the Foe- Vanquisher or arhat (Tib. dgra bcom pa) (6), since it has gained victory over the objects of samsara [having vanquished all enemies, which are karma and the mental poisons]. It has become the Quintessence ol Self-Awareness (Tib. so so rang gis rig pa'i bdag nyid) (7).When great enlightenment expressed by means of these seven syn­onymous names is categorized, it can be fully divided into three prop­erties, which are the qualities of depth, vastness, and greatness. It is deep since it is difficult to realize. It is vast since it wields power, and it is the embodiment of greatness since it corresponds to any karmic forturxe. In the same sequence there are therefore three kayas: the sva­bhavikakaya, the kaya of the nature or essence that is deep, and so forth. \"And so forth\" refers to the sambhogakaya, which is vast, and to the nirmanakaya, which is the embodiment of greatness. Through these three kayas benefit for oneself and others is achieved spontane­ously and without interruption. (See also Part Three, annotation 66.)B.IL2.2.2.2.3.5.2.2.

It is uncreated since it is far away from the aspects of arising, abiding, and disintegration, which are the properties of anything compounded, that is, created [by causes and conditions]. And it is totally indivisible since the unpolluted dharmadhatu and final ultimate primordial wisdom are entirely mixed into one.(2) The two extremes of etemalism and nihilism are completely abandoned, eternalism being equivalent to an exaggerative [view in that existence is asserted where it is not present] and nihilism being equivalent to a depreciating [view in that existence is denied where it is present].(3) It is definitively freed from the three veils, which are the veil of the mental poisons, the veil of the obstructions to knowledge, and the veil of the obstructions to meditative equipoise. The first-mentioned veil consists of avarice and so forth. The second-mentioned veil does not contain any mental poisons but constitutes the obstacle that hin­ders one from understanding the knowable. The third-mentioned veil is a particular aspect of the veil of the obstructions to knowledge. It consists of not knowing how to rest evenly in meditative equipoise just as one wishes. Freedom from these [three] constitutes the charac­teristics of being free from the veils or obscurations.(4) It is free from the pollution of the mental poisons and is not an object or field of experience for any thought or conceptualization.(5) It is the field of experience of the self-aware primordial wisdom of those ultimate yogis who always rest evenly in the meditative equi­poise in which means and discriminative wisdom are in union. The deep dharmadhatu has been by essence utterly pure since beginning- less time. For these reasons it has the characteristic of being by nature luminous clarity.

Those who have perfectly followed these paths have attained arhathood or self-enlightenment, respectively. When this is achieved, they hold the belief that they have attained nirvana, though they have not yet reached the final ultimate state.

But is there also a necessity [to stay]?\" (2) There is the necessity to always stay for the benefit of others due to the following reason: When they initially generated bodhichitta in order to benefit all sentient be­ings, they vowed to free all disciples without any exception from the cycle of existence. There is the necessity to fulfill this vow to its full extent. [Thus they will stay permanently] since the number of dis­ciples is inexhaustible.Then one may wonder: \"So there is necessity, but is there also such a noble wish?\" (3) There is the wish to accomplish the benefit of all oth­ers, since buddhahood supremely expresses itself as great compassion,"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 213cleansed of karma and mental poisons and purified from the veil of the hindrances to knowledge.Then one may wonder: \"So there is the wish to accomplish the ben­efit of others, but is it not satiated and exhausted by rendering benefit in the course of one lifetime?\" (4) There is the ability to always stay for the sake of others. The reason is that they possess ability provided by the support [lit. \"feet\"] of miraculous powers, on the basis of which the appearance of the visible kayas is displayed. Through these mi­raculous powers they have the ability to act forever, as long as sam­sara may last.There are three reasons why they do not forsake the world:\"So there is permanent abiding for the sake of others. But will there not be an urge to leave samsara, there being the view of samsara and nirvana being different in that samsara is considered as something to be abandoned, whereas nirvana should be adopted?\"(1) They do not have any notion of abandoning and adopting with respect to samsara and nirvana. This is because they know the nature of all objects of knowledge just as it is, they know the way they are. By this knowledge they are freed from the belief that is fixed on the dual­ity of samsara and nirvana, wherein samsara is viewed as being some­thing to be abandoned, while nirvana is viewed as being something to be adopted.\"When they abide in samsara, are they not harmed by the suffering experienced in the cycle of existence?\"(2) They are not harmed, since they always possess the best pos­sible bliss of samadhi, which is inconceivable and beyond any end.\"So they are not harmed by suffering, but are they not affected by its faults?\"(3) It is impossible for them to be harmed by the faults of samsara for the following reason: When they act within the world for the sake of others, they are not sullied by worldly phenomena such as karma, mental poisons, suffering, and so forth.B.1L22.2.2.3.6.2.2.

Explanation of the way it is difficult to realizeSince through peerless primordial wisdom, great compassion, and further attributes all qualities are finally perfected, the Victor is inconceivable.Thus the last mode of the Self-Sprung Ones is not even seen by those Great Sages who have received \"the Empowerment [of Splendorous Light Rays].\"Through peerless primordial wisdom, great compassion, and its further attributes it constitutes the final ultimate perfection of [all] qualities. For this reason, the state of all victors, embracing the dharma­kaya and the visible kayas, does not abide in either extreme of samsara or nirvana and is therefore inconceivable. Thus \"the last mode of the Self-Sprung Ones\" is not even seen as it is by the Great Sages who have received the Empowerment of Splendorous Light Rays and thereby dwell on the tenth bodhisattva level.[The formulation in the root text: \"the last mode of the Self-Sprung Ones\" can be explained in two ways]:There are eight qualities of the Self-Sprung Victorious Ones. The last, being the mode in which they are inconceivable, is not even seen as it is [by a tenth level bodhisattva].Or else: Bringing to mind how bodhichitta was developed for the first time, the final mode in which one directly and perfectly awakens and expands [in buddhahood] is not even seen as it is [by a tenth level bodhisattva]."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 217In this context the Lion of Speech Rongtön remarks:Since this mentions the term dbang [which is here explained as being short for dbang bskur, \"empowerment\"], it is commented:\"It is not even known by those who have attained the eighth [bhumi] by attaining the ten powers (Tib. dbang bcu).u Drawing that connection does not correspond to the meaning of the chapter.♦ This was the section \"Enlightenment,\" the second chapter of The Commentary on the Highest Continuity of the Mahayana Dharma which Analyzes the Disposition of the Rare and Sublime Ones.With this the complete explanation of the second chapter, teaching enlightenment or the means of realization, is achieved."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Chapter ThreeThe Sixth Vajra Point: QualitiesB.ll.2.2.2.3.

Concise explanation of the essencePerfectly enlightened [in] all phenomena, setting an end to [all] hindrances, teaching the path, and showing cessation are the four aspects of fearlessness.On the path of training, buddhas have taught the Dharma without greed and avarice, being guided by a calm and impartial mind. In the meantime [while following the path] they have not relied on adverse phenomena. They have kept to the path of all virtuous [lit. \"white\"] phenomena and taught the Dharma without any pride. For these rea­sons, no opponent can defeat their sacred words when they state: \"I am directly and perfectly enlightened within the sphere of all phe­nomena!\" proclaiming this to be the best possible realization and ben­efit for oneself (1). No one whosoever can contest them when they state: \"Set an end to attachment and so forth, the hindrances to libera­tion!\" teaching these to be the impediments to the benefit of others(2). No other follower of Dharma can oppose them when they teach the path that definitively brings forth the benefit of others, showing the thirty-seven dharmas conducive to enlightenment as being the path of liberation (3). And no one whosoever can defeat them when they demonstrate having attained cessation itself, where everything that is to be abandoned has been ceased, declaring this to be the best pos­sible abandonment and benefit for oneself (4).For these reasons buddhas have attained physical well-being, free­dom from intimidation, and mental dauntlessness. There are there­fore the qualities in terms of the four aspects of the fearlessness native to all buddhas. (See also Part Four, note 12.)B.77.2.2.2.3.2.2.2.2.2.

Thus the Great Sages are unhindered anywhere.The function of these [four fearlessnesses] is as follows: Perfect buddhas themselves know the truth of suffering in every respect. They know all the things that are to be known in relation to oneself and others, and they cause the other beings to gain this knowledge (1). They themselves have abandoned everything contained in the truth of origination. They have abandoned all things to be abandoned in relation to oneself and others, and they lead the other beings to aban­don them as well (2). They themselves have relied on the truth of the path. They have relied on everything that needs to be relied upon in relation to oneself and others, and cause the other beings to gain ac­cess to this reliance (3). They themselves have attained the truth of cessation. They have attained the peerless and stainless state that is to be attained by oneself and others, and they manifest for all other sen­tient beings so that they attain it as well (4). Having themselves made the meaning of the Four Noble Truths immediately apparent, they truthfully relate this meaning to all other beings. For these reasons the perfect buddhas are the great sages who manifest in an unhindered way with respect to teaching the sacred Dharma in any assembly, be it a gathering of monks, of Brahmins, and so on.B.7/.2.2.2.3.2.2.1.2.3.

As far as his verbal behavior is con­cerned there is no idle talk (2). Likewise the Teacher's mindfulness does not suffer any impairment (3). His mind is never such that it does not rest evenly in meditative equipoise (4). There is also no har­boring of various ideas (5).

His vision of the primor­dial wisdom of total release does not get diminished (12).Here the reason why the different kinds of samadhi are enumer­ated is the intention [of showing them] to stand collectively for the fact that a buddha never has a mind that does not dwell in meditative equipoise.(c) The three unmixed features of activity: The activities of body(13), speech (14), and mind (15) are preceded by primordial wisdom and are achieved manifesting in its likeness.(d) The three unmixed features of primordial wisdom: Since his in­tellect has been purified with respect to all knowable phenomena of the three times (16-18), he has attained the unobscured vision of pri­mordial wisdom that is free from obstruction and without attachment with regard to the three aspects of time [these being past, present, and future]."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lions Roar 225Such are the eighteen features; in addition to these there are further ones: His physical body is beyond measure and [the height of] his ushnisha cannot be perceived.

Any of the individual features of space, such as not obstructing other phe­nomena, offering an opportunity [for their arising], and so on, are not native to anything visible.

The mark of the Muni is espe­cially excellent through its being perfect, clear, and situated in its place.(28) Since his mind was suited to seek the Dharma, and since he has given housing and so on to others, his skin is pure and delicate.(29) Since a buddha who is supreme among all sentient beings has offered clothing and seats pleasant to the senses, his skin is of the color of gold.(30) lie has forsaken the worldly hustle and bustle and increased any virtue he had genuinely adopted, such as having a mind suited to seek the Dharma and so on. For this reason the hairs on his body are extremely fine and soft; each grows from one pore and curls to the right upwards towards the crown of his body.(31) Because of his compassionate love towards all, and because he has abandoned any impulse to strike or use weapons, his hair is im­maculate and resembles in color a deep-blue gem.(32) He has donated monasteries, groves, and so on, and he has connected others with [the practice of] samadhi. For this reason his physical stature is well-proportioned, like the mandala of a perfect nyagrodha tree. And the all-good Buddha, the Great Sage who is with­out any example, has a firm and unbreakable body possessing the strength of Narayana.These thirty-two [marks], which one cannot conceive of or grasp and which are resplendent in their brightness and beauty, the Teacher has described in the Ratnadarikasutra (Tib. bu mo rin chen gyis zhus pa'i do) as being the signs of a buddha, a lord of humans."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 231This passage differs from the way in which the pure marks [of a buddha] are defined in the Abhisamayalamkam (Tib. mngon rtogs rgyan), where each is only mentioned, but the meaning is the same. When here the number of thirty-two is established, this mainly refers to the body being taught as the basis of thirty-two qualities. Differing from other [scriptures], the fact that [his soles] are perfectly even and marked with wheels is taken as one [mark]. The fact that [his feet are] broad and his ankles not visible is [also] considered as one. So is the fact that the hairs on his body are extremely fine and grow from one pore, curl­ing to the right upwards to his crown. This is the intended meaning of the Ratnadarikasutra. Then, one may wonder what other ways there are besides summarizing [the marks of a perfect buddha] into thirty- two. Apart from [their classification] into thirty-six as was just ex­plained, elsewhere examples are also given of eighty pure [marks] being the qualities of complete maturation. Other than that, all buddha qualities, as many as there are, are [described as] those of complete maturation, being equivalent to the fruit of the complete ripening of the accumulation that has been gathered on the path of training.

Viewing the fruit of meditative equipoise, which is the accumulation of primordial wis­dom, there are thirty-two qualities of freedom. Viewing the fruit of the phase ensuing from meditative equipoise, which is the accumula­tion of merit, there are thirty-two qualities of complete maturation.

Illustration of the unmixedfeatures by means of examplesThe understanding of worldly beings, of listeners, of biased practitioners, of those who have insight, and of self-sprung buddhas getting ever subtler and progressively refined, there are five similes:Sustaining the life of all worldly beings, [buddhas] are likened to earth and water and to fire and air.Away from the features of the worldly and of those being beyond the world, they are similar to space.Earlier the unmixed features were described by the example of space, and in addition to that earth, water, fire, air, and so on were men­tioned to supplement it. One may wonder for what purpose these ex­amples are given. The understanding of ordinary worldly beings, of listeners (Skt. shravakas), of pratyekabuddhas practicing their own benefit in a biased, one-sided way, of bodhisattvas who have insight, and of buddhas who are self-sprung, is progressively more subtle and profound [and] finally supreme. The characteristics of earth, water, fire, and wind, which are taken as examples, are progressively subtler from the former to the next. Since, therefore, understanding is facili­tated when combining the meaning with these examples, the five ex­amples of earth and so on are given. Furthermore, these five examples are applied since buddhahood constitutes the ground providing sus­tenance of life for all the worlds. Earth forming the basis, water bring­ing about cohesion, fire bringing about ripening, air preventing pu­trefaction, and space offering the opportunity for all of these, they proffer the possibility of life. Similar to the last-mentioned [example of space], the unmixed features of a buddha are far away from the characteristics or qualities of ordinary worldly beings, as well as from those of noble shravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who are beyond the worldly. They have nothing in common with these characteristics. For this reason they are similar to space, which is beyond the characteristics of the four [other] elements.B M 2 2 2 .3 2 A 2 1 A .

They adhere to the nirmanakaya and the sambhogakaya, which is to say, the illusory kaya and the kaya that perfectly rejoices in Dharma. These are the two visible kayas, since they embody the buddha qualities appearing to the disciples.B./J.2.2.2.3.2.4.2.2.2. The way the two kayas are illustrated by the example of the moonThose far from and close to purity [see them] as the mandalas of the world the Victor, like the form of the moon in water and sky.Thus these [kayas] are beheld in two ways.There are disciples who are far away from being utterly purified from the veils that constitute the hindrance to seeing the visible kayas, and there are others who are very close to it. The former are ordinary beings, shravakas and so on, and the latter are bodhisattvas who dwell on the ten bhumis. In the given sequence, the nirmanakaya appears to ordinary beings in the mandala of the world and its circumstances, and the sambhogakaya appears to the bodhisattvas in the mandala of the Victorious One and his retinue. This is, for example, like seeing the form of the moon in pure water and like seeing it in the sky. Thus there are two kinds of disciples who see these two kayas which are embellished by the pure marks.

These constitute the supportive cause (Tib. nye barston pa'i rgyu). Through these, all vehicles or paths of beings are definitively accomplished without any exception.

This path is the condition or cause of [buddha] activity and is equivalent to the ten"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"242 Buddha Naturebodhisattva levels. While one gradually travels through these ten lev­els, the qualities they represent will ever increase. The supportive cause of [buddha] activity is the two accumulations of primordial wisdom and merit, or in other words, of wisdom and [skillful] means. The ultimate fruit of these causes and conditions is the attainment of great enlightenment, which is authentically perfected, unsurpassable, and supreme. Once enlightenment is attained, it is seen that there is an object for the manifestation of [buddha] activity, as all sentient be­ings also possess buddha nature. When this is seen, sentient beings are fully sustained. This buddha nature [within beings] is obscured by the endless afflictions, the secondary afflictions, and the accom­panying latencies or karmic imprints. These adventitious defilements must be overcome; the condition that at all times vanquishes these veils is great compassion, out of which the path is taught. For the first-mentioned reasons and the latter-mentioned as well, buddha activity is uninterrupted.In this context Rongtonpa the Great has said, explaining this sec­tion very well:Therefore, what is the cause for activity to be uninterrupted? It stems from having formerly traveled the paths and gone through the accumulations. Through the attainment of what fruit is it un­interrupted? Through the attainment of enlightenment. What ob­ject is there for it to be uninterrupted? Since the nature of enlight­enment is present in all sentient beings and is identical [with en­lightenment itself] (Tib. tshul du), the veils obscuring it are cleared away by great compassion.B./J.2.2.2.4.2.2.3. Illustration of these by means of examplesThese six points, being similar to an ocean, the sun, space, a treasure, clouds, and wind are to be grasped accordingly.Six points or meanings serve as the reasons why the activity of a tathagata is uninterrupted or ever-present. These are to be understood through combining one meaning with an example, respectively. In their given sequence they are to be grasped as being similar to a vast ocean, to the unpolluted sun, to the element of space, to a great treasure, to a multitude of clouds that are to be dispelled, and to the force of a mighty wind dispelling [these clouds]."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lions Roar 243B .U 222A 22A .

For this reason the ten bodhisattva levels, being the cause that definitively reveals release, are like an ocean. Since they benefit all sentient beings, sus­taining them with happiness and well-being, the two accumulations of merit and primordial wisdom, which constitute the supportive cause, are like the sun. Pervading everything it is vast, and being with­out middle or end it is deep and profound. For this reason gTeat en­lightenment, which is the fruit of these [causes], is like the element of space. Dharmata, the actual state of a truly perfect buddha, has been spontaneously present since beginningless time [and] contains an in­exhaustible wealth of qualities. For this reason sentient beings must be fully sustained and the tathagatagarbha, their element that is by nature pure, is similar to a great treasure. They are adventitious, being able to be removed; they pervade the nature and ultimately do not truly exist. For this reason the afflictions obscuring the element that is by nature utterly pure are similar to a dense host of clouds.

The way of appearanceThose endowed with unpolluted faith and so forth, having cultivated the qualities of faith and so on, will see in their own minds the Buddha's appearance, which is perfect and has special signs and marks.They will see the Buddha while he is walking, while he is standing, sitting, or resting in sleep.They will see him in manifold forms of conduct: when explaining the teaching leading to peace, when silently resting in meditative equipoise, or when displaying various forms of miracles.Possessed of great splendor and magnificence,[the Buddha] will be seen by all sentient beings.As is shown by the example, [first] one has to rid [one's mind] of the pollution of distrust and so on, of everything that belongs to the opposite side of faith, diligence, and so forth. Once this pollution is eliminated, one has to gradually cultivate all the qualities, such as faith, diligence, mindfulness, and so on. Through the power of this cultivation one's own mind will become clear and the visible kaya of the Perfect Buddha, endowed with the thirty-two pure signs and the eighty special marks, will appear in it. He will be seen in manifold forms of conduct, at times walking or standing, sitting on a seat or resting in sleep, going somewhere, and so forth. He will be seen while explaining the teaching of the peace of nirvana to the disciples, and at other times while not teaching the Dharma but resting in meditative equipoise, immersed in the truth within. Beings will see him display­ing various forms of miracles, such as magical illusions and so on. Thus all sentient beings of karmic fortune will see the Buddha in an endless number of illusory appearances, such as an appearance sur­rounded by a mandala of light and thereby endowed with great splen­dor and magnificence, and so forth."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"248 Buddha NatureB.U.2.2.2A.3.2.1.1.2.2.

Out of this wish and in order to quickly attain buddhahood, one will fully unite with the practices of virtue, such as studying [the Dharma] and so forth. In a genuine manner one will adopt the causes that accom­plish this [aim].

Detailed explanation of the exampleIf the whole earth became rid of fearful places and turned into an even surface of lapis lazuli that was flawless, radiant, and beautiful, having a gem's qualities and unstained luster, various divine abodes and the form of their Lord would shine forth within it because of its purity.Then, as the earth gradually lost these properties, they would be invisible again and appear no more.Yet, for their real attainment the men and women would side with the vows of individual release, with penitence, authentic giving, and so forth, scattering flowers and so on with longing minds.Suppose through the power of virtue, the great earth, the whole of Zambuling, became rid of rocky ravines and other fearful places and turned into an even surface, smooth as the palm of a hand and made from flawless lapis lazuli. Radiant and beautiful, it would possess a luster free from any stain such as containing flaws of less precious materials (Tib. rngul) and so on, and all the qualities of a precious gem would be complete. Thus it would be arranged in the likeness of an ornament. Since this ground would be extremely pure, the various divine abodes such as the Lord of the Gods' sublime palace called \"the All-Victorious,\" and so on, would shine forth within it. And the reflections of the King of the Gods and his retinue would clearly ap­pear. Later these properties of [the earth] would gradually be lost. Due to that, these reflections would become invisible again and appear no more: they would have arisen and ceased. Yet, through the power of"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"250 Buddha Naturehaving seen these reflections all the men and women would side with [the practice of virtue]. To attain the state of Indra in its real substance they would [adopt] the vows of individual release, speaking the truth and so forth, and would practice penitence (Tib. brtul zhugs). They would genuinely train in generosity, giving material goods and so on, and then proceed to moral discipline, to meditation, and so on. With longing minds they would scatter flowers and so forth, and joining the palms of their hands would utter prayers to be reborn as gods. In this way they would train on the path in order to attain the visible kaya [they had formerly seen].B.II.2.2.2A.3.2.1.1A. Precise depiction of the meaningLikewise, to attain the state of a Lord of Munis shining forth in their minds, which are similar to pure lapis lazuli, the heirs of the Victor, their vision filled with sheer delight, give rise to bodhichitta in the most perfect manner.Those human beings who have seen the reflection of Indra are filled with aspiration towards him. Likewise, the bodhisattvas, the heirs of the Victor, whose minds are filled with sheer delight in the Buddha, give rise to bodhichitta, to the mind aspiring to unsurpassable en­lightenment, in the most perfect manner. They do so since they [feel the] need to attain the state of the Lord of Munis, whose appearance shines forth in their own pure minds, which are similar to pure lapis lazuli.B.II.2.2.2A.3.2.1.1.5. Summary of the way in which there is freedom from arising and cessationJust as mirrored by the purified lapis lazuli ground the physical appearance of the Lord of Gods is seen, likewise the kaya of the Lord of Munis is reflected in the purified ground of sentient beings' minds.Whether these reflections will rise or set in beings owes to their own minds being sullied or unstained.Like the form [of Lord Indra] appearing in the worlds, they are not to be viewed as \"existent\" or \"extinct.\"When in the world of human beings the ground consists of lapis lazuli, having become purified and free from any pollution of dust and so on, the reflection of the Lord of Gods will appear in it together with all his wealth. In the same sense the reflection of the kaya of the Lord of Munis possessed of the pure marks will shine forth in the"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 251ground of the minds of beings. This will happen once the disciples' minds have become purified and are free from the stains of distrust and so forth. Also, just as described in the example, the reflection of the buddhakaya will seem to appear and disappear in sentient beings to be trained. This is due to the way their own minds manifest. When their minds have become pure and are not stained by lack of faith and so on, then through the power of this mental condition the visible kaya will seem to rise [in them]. Whereas, when their minds are ut­terly impure and sullied by distrust and so on, then through the power of this frame of mind the visible kaya will seem to have set. In the example the reflection of the Lord of the Gods seems to appear and disappear, depending upon the ground in the worlds of human be­ings, which is either pure or impure. Yet, the Lord of the Gods himself does not move away from his own abode. In the same sense, the vis­ible kaya seems to arise and cease depending upon the disciples being pure or impure. Yet the ultimate dharmakaya is not to be viewed in any way in terms of \"arising and ceasing\" or in terms of \"existent and extinct.\" This is because it is both uncreated and uninterruptedness itself.

Presentation of the exampleBy the power of the gods' former virtue the Dharma drum [arose] among them.Involving no effort, origin, or thought, no vibration and no intention at all, the drum resounds again and again with \"impermanence\" and \"suffering,\"\"non-existence of self\" and \"peace,\" admonishing all the careless gods.In the sky above the roof of the beautiful palace \"the All-Victori­ous\" there is the great drum of Dharma called \"Donator of Teaching's Sound,\" which arose among the gods by the power of their former unstained virtuous deeds. From this drum articulate sound arises with­out involving any effort in terms of someone beating it and so on. There is no origin that produces the sound such as a tongue, throat, and so on, no intention in terms of a thinking mind, and no visible basis in terms of vibration. It is free from any ideation such as think­ing: \"I will produce a sound.\" Without there being any of these, the sounds of: \"All compounded things are impermanent!\" \"Everything bound up with pollution is suffering!\" \"All phenomena are devoid of"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"252 Buddha Natureself!\" and \"Nirvana is peace!\" arise from it again and again. Thus it admonishes all the gods who have become careless, seeking distrac­tion in the pleasures of the senses, to turn [their minds] to Dharma.B .II222A.32.122. Teaching the meaningLikewise, though free from effort and so on, the buddha speech of the All-Pervading Ones permeates sentient beings without exception, teaching Dharma to those of karmic fortune.Similar to the foregoing example, the perfect buddhas who pervade existence and peace are without the five [aspects mentioned above]. Though they are free from the deliberate effort of articulating the Dharma and so on, they permeate all sentient beings without any ex­ception by means of their buddha speech. To those of karmic fortune they teach the Dharma in correspondence to their respective capaci­ties and gifts.B.IL222A.32.12.3. The function of the meaning and the example B.II222A.32.12.3.1. Detailed explanationJust as the sound of the drum arises among the gods from their own deeds, the Dharma spoken by the Muni arises in the world from beings' own deeds.Just as the sound [of the drum] accomplishes peace without effort, origin, visible form, or intention, likewise the Dharma causes accomplishment of peace without deliberate effort or any other such feature.The sound of the great drum arises among the gods due to the power of their own virtuous deeds. Similar to that, the appearance of the Munis who utter Buddha Dharma in the world of the disciples arises from the virtuous deeds done by all sentient beings themselves. The sound of the drum [comes about] without the effort of someone [beat­ing it], without any place of origin, without basis in terms of a visible form, and without thinking in terms of intention. And yet, the sound of the drum, though it has none [of these features] at all, admonishes the gods to [turn their minds towards] Dharma and thus accomplishes peace. Likewise a buddha is free from any deliberate effort of teach­ing the Dharma and so on. And yet this Dharma, though it has none [of these features] at all, causes the disciples to pacify their suffering and to accomplish nirvana, the state beyond any torment and pain."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 253B.II.2.2.2A3.2.1.232. Summary of the meaningThe sound of the drum in the city of the gods acts as the cause, yielding the gift of undauntedness and granting them victoryover the host of the asuras, when these, driven by their poisons, make war upon them, and it dispels the gods' reveling in play.Likewise, arising in the worlds from the cause of meditative stability, formless dimension, and so on, it expresses the modeof the unsurpassable path, which will fully overcome all affliction and suffering and thus lead all sentient beings to peace.The sound of the great drum that is present in the city of the gods, suspended in the sky above the sublime palace \"the All-Victorious,\" acts as the cause yielding the gift of fearlessness to the gods. At the time when the gods have gone into the dense forests, and the asuras, generating the mental poison of hatred, make war upon them, this fearlessness grants them victory over the host of the demigods. The sound of the drum dispels the gods' reveling in various plays, their distraction and indulgence in sense pleasures, and thus gradually leads them to enlightenment. Similarly the speech of the Buddha arises in the worlds of the disciples from their reliance on virtues such as the practice of the samadhis of meditative stability and of the formless dimensions (Tib. gsugs med), and so on. Due to this cause, buddha speech fully overcomes the afflictions of all sentient beings, which constitute the cause, and their suffering, which constitutes [its] fruit. It perfectly expresses the Great Vehicle, the mode of the unsurpass­able path [leading to] peace, to the pacification of all suffering with­out exception.B.II.2.2.2A.3.2.1.2A. Expressing its specialtyUniversal, of benefit, bestowing bliss, and endowed with threefold miracle, the Muni's melody is by far superior to the cymbals treasured by the gods.Being there for all the endless number of disciples, [manifesting] in tune with the very own wishes and motivations of each, it is univer­sal, the quintessence of freedom from any smallness and limitation (Tib. nyi tshe ba ma yin pa nyid). Since ultimately it joins them with the"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"State representing the definitive good, it is the quintessence of benefit. Since meanwhile it joins them with the joy of the higher states of exist­ence, it is the quintessence of bliss. It is endowed with three types of miraculous display. These are displaying miraculous powers (Tib. rdzu 'phrul gyi cho 'phrul), displaying all-pervasive expression (Tib. kun tu brjod pa'i cho 'phrul), and displaying the miraculous effects of teaching the Dharma (Tib. rjes su bstan pa'i cho 'phrul). Through these it is the quintessence of definitive release from all suffering. Since it possesses these four qualities or properties, the melody of the Muni articulating the teaching of all perfect buddhas is superior to and by far more ex­cellent than the cymbals that are in the possession of the gods. These cymbals are limited and of small reach. They neither constitute ben­efit nor happiness or definitive release. (See also Part Three, annota­tion 76.)B.ll.2.2.2.4.3.2.1.2.5. Explanation in combination with the three miraculous displaysThe mighty sound of the drum in the divine realms does not reach the ears of those dwelling on earth, whereas the drumming sound of Buddha's [speech] even reaches the subterranean worlds of samsara.Millions of divine cymbals resound among the gods to set the fire of lust ablaze and to fan its flames.The single melody of Those of Compassionate Being manifests to fully quench all the fires of suffering.The beautiful and bewitching sound of the cymbals causes among the gods increase of their distraction, whereas the speech of the compassionate Tathagata exhorts [us] to reflect and commits the mind to samadhi.Any cause of happiness for earthly beings and gods in whichever sphere of the world without exception, briefly spoken, fully depends upon this melody that pervades all the worlds, not forsaking one.Though the mighty sound of a heavenly drum pervasively reaches all the endless abodes of the gods, it is still limited and does not reach the ears of those sentient beings who dwell on the surface of the earth. Whereas, when a buddha utters Dharma at the right time, the sound of this drum reaches everywhere, pervading even those disciples who dwell in the subterranean worlds of samsara. For this reason [the speech of a buddha] is totally unlimited and is therefore of special excellence.254 Buddha Nature"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 255In this context the noble Karma Thrinlapa has said:The drum m entioned here is to be taken as belonging to the [class of] ordinary heavenly cymbals and drums, which are different from the great drum [of Dharma]. This passage is an expanded explanation of the foregoing section starting with: \"Universal, of benefit, bestowing bliss...,\" whereas the great drum has been ex­plained in an earlier section by means of one stanza in terms of a particular property that is distinct from the ordinary [heavenly] cymbals. To think that the line:\"... does not reach the ears of those dwelling on earth\" includes the statement that the great drum is not heard by human beings and so on w ho dwell on the earth is therefore erroneous. This opinion contradicts the statement that the Four Guiding Principles of Dharma and so forth, which arise from the sound of the great heavenly drum, admonish the gods and turn them away from their careless pursuit [of sensual plea­sures]. So if w e nowadays heard this from som eone and there­upon spoke accordingly, w e would insult our ow n [intelligence].That w e should not do!(See also Part Three, annotation 77.)T^iere are many millions of different kinds of divine cymbals among the gods. Yet, these only resound in order to set ablaze the fire of crav­ing for the happiness derived from sense pleasures, and to increase it, fanning its flames. Thus they are of no benefit. The melodious speech of perfect buddhas, who are the embodiment of great compassion, is just of one kind. Yet, with its single melody it leads all disciples of karmic fortune to fully quench the fires of their manifold suffering along with its causes, and to attain the state beyond torment and pain. Since [the speech of the Buddha] manifests for this purpose, it is ben­eficial and thus again especially excellent.In the divine realms, the sound of the cymbals, which are beauti­fully shaped and bewitching the very moment one hears them, is var­ied and manifold. Yet, it acts as the cause that makes the mind yearn for objects and increases its being totally distracted and scattered. Therefore, this sound does not constitute [any true] happiness. Con­trary to that, the speech of tathagatas who are endowed with great compassion itself acts as the cause that exhorts the disciples to reflect and to commit their minds to meditative stability and samadhi. For this reason it constitutes happiness and thus is also especially excellent.In brief, the cymbals treasured by the gods do not constitute what will definitively reveal release. As opposed to that, there is a cause relinquishing all suffering and the sources of suffering experienced"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"256 Buddha Natureby gods, by humans dwelling on the earth, and so forth, in whichever sphere of the world without exception. All suffering being ended, it will increase unpolluted great bliss. Such a cause is said to fully de­pend upon the melody of buddha speech, which wielding three types of miraculous display pervades all world spheres, not forsaking one. For this reason it constitutes definitive release from suffering and is therefore also especially excellent.Here, through these four stanzas [each consisting of four lines], what is limited or unlimited, what is beneficial or non-beneficial, what [yields] happiness or non-happiness, and what definitively reveals release or does not, is taught extensively.B.//.2.2.2.4.3.2.2.2.6. Where the power of speech does not enter and where it is unhinderedWithout [an intact sense of] hearing one cannot experience subtle sound, and all [its manifold variations] do not even reach the ears of a god.Likewise, as the field of experience of the very finest primordial wisdom, the subtle Dharma only reaches the ear of someone whose mind is rid of poison.Just as, for example, without an intact sense of hearing one does not experience subtle sound and cannot hear it, similarly those who do not have the [respective] karmic fortune do not hear the melody of buddha speech. All the different variations and particularities of sound do not even reach the ears of someone who has attained divine hear­ing, and are only heard by some. Likewise, the extremely subtle and profound teaching of a buddha does not reach the ears of all the dis­ciples. This Dharma is exclusively the field of experience of the very finest primordial wisdom. As such it only reaches the ears of someone who has great karmic fortune, having become a supreme disciple whose mind is rid of the mental poisons.

Yet, on the surface of the earth, through its contact with salty and other grounds, with good and poor soils that are present there, it acquires very many tastes, such as a sweet or a bitter flavor and so on. In the same sense, when raining from the heart of the extremely high and vast cloud of compassionate love, the waters of the teachings of the noble eightfold path are one and the same. Yet, due to the ground, which is the mindstream and make-up of beings to be trained, due to their different aspirations, it acquires many kinds of tastes, such as the flavor of the shravaka vehicle and so on. In this way it seems to be of various kinds.In his commentary to Vasubandhu's Treasury of Knowledge (Skt. Abhidharmakosatika, Tib. chos mngon pa'i mdzod kyi 'grel bshad), Yasho- mitra describes the eight properties of water as follows:It is cool, delicious, light, and soft, of clear transparency and unpolluted.Drinking it does not cause any harm to the stomach or to the throat.In this context the Venerable Seventh [Karmapa] has said:The Victorious One has spoken all his sublime words solely in the light of the definitive meaning (Tib. nges don). Due to the various ways of understanding of the disciples, they are grasped as being provisional, as being a meaning requiring interpretation (Tib. drang don), and so forth. The presentation in terms of \"definitive\" and \"provisional\" is therefore made from the viewpoint of the dis­ciples. Yet, from the viewpoint of the own essence of the teach­ings itself they are all exclusively a definitive meaning.This seems to finally conclude the intended meaning of this present text, the Uttara Tantra.

The second is uncertain in that beings of that group are neutral, dwelling between faith and non-faith towards this vehicle. The third group is certain in a perverted way in that there is animosity towards the supreme vehicle.

Combination of example and meaning in terms of corresponding propertiesAt the end of spring, when there are no clouds, human beings and the birds that rarely fly [are unhappy or neutral, respectively]. When rain is falling in summertime, the craving spirits suffer.Similar to this example, the arising and non-arising of the Dharma-rain from the host of clouds of compassion also [leads to opposite reactions] in worldly beings who long for Dharma or are hostile to it, respectively.In the hot season at the end of spring, when there are no clouds, human beings are unhappy, the peacocks who [rarely fly and thus] do"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"260 Buddha Naturenot continuously move in the sky react with indifference, and the crav­ing spirits are happy. When in summertime the rain falls onto the earth, human beings are happy, peacocks are again indifferent, and it causes suffering to the craving spirits, since to them it transforms into a rain of hailstones. Similarly, when the rain of the sacred Dharma brought forth by the host of the clouds of compassion arises in the worlds, it leads those who long for Dharma to be happy, leaves those who are neutral indifferent, and makes those who are hostile to Dharma un­happy. Its non-arising again makes the hostile ones happy, leaves the neutral ones indifferent, and makes those longing for Dharma unhappy.

Likewise the cloud of knowledge and compassionate love releases the drops of emptiness and skillful means such as generosity and so on, of [teaching] in the subtle and the vast way. In doing so, it does not attend to the fact at all that these will purify the afflictions of those who have devotion to­wards the Great Vehicle, whereas they may increase the dormant ten­dencies towards holding the view of an [existing] self in those who are hostile to it.

Depiction of suffering and its eliminationIn this cycle of beginningless birth and death five paths are open for sentient beings to tread.Just as no sweet scent is found in excrement, no happiness will be found among the five types of beings.Their suffering resembles the continuous pain arising from fire and weapons, or [from a wound] being touched by salt, and so on.The great rain of sacred Dharma pours down in cascades from the cloud of compassion, fully soothing and appeasing this [pain].The twelve branches of interdependent origination, which are com­pounded by and consist of the active state of the three mental poisons repeatedly evolve in an ongoing cycle. Due to this cycle there is the suffering of being bom, of dying, and so on. [To beings caught in this cycle, the suffering it involves] is without beginning and end. They do not have the certainty that it has only arisen from these [poisons]. And those who do not practice the path of release do not have any cer­tainty either that [suffering] will be ended when [the practice of] this [path] is finalized. In this place of beginningless and endless suffering there are five paths open for sentient beings to tread. These are the three kinds of evil wanderings (Tib. ngan song: of hell beings, craving spirits, and animals) and the two paths of gods and men. Just as in excrement and similar unclean things no sweet scent is to be found at all, there is also not the slightest opportunity for happiness in the cycles of existence of the five kinds of beings. This is because [the cycle of existence] is the abode of suffering itself, being direly and utterly steeped in the three kinds of suffering, the eight kinds of suffering, and so on. The specific suffering ingrained in this cycle of existence is comparable to the feeling of pain arising from being forever burnt by an enormous fire, from being continuously cut by sharp weapons, or from a raw wound coming in touch with salt, and so on. For anyone who abides in this [state] extremely hard to endure, a buddha [mani­fests] the cloud of great compassion, consisting of the wish to liberate all these [beings] from their suffering.

This is its cause!And this is cessation of misery!\"\"Even gods are subject to the suffering of death and transmigra­tion, which will lead them to fall [into a lower state of existence]. And human beings suffer as well—they have the suffering of holding on to and protecting whatever is there and of desperately striving for what­ever is not there for them. Beside that, they are subject to other suffer­ings, such as hunger and thirst, weariness and fatigue, and many oth­ers.\" Those skillful ones who possess the discriminative wisdom that understands the nature of samsara and nirvana realize this. For this reason they have no desire, not even for the highest state of a god or a human being. They neither long for the state of Indra, the lord of the gods, and so on, nor do they long for the state of a Chakravartin, the lord of mankind, and so on. Throughout their former existences they have attained discriminative wisdom and [generated] utter faith in the sublime words of the Tathagata, which are free from any pollu­tion. By the power of this faith they continue to follow these words in this life as well, and carry out the aspects of study and reflection in the right fashion. Resulting from this [practice] there is completely pure discriminative wisdom that realizes the non-existence of a self and thus constitutes the path. Through this wisdom they truly and unmistakenly see: \"The aspect of the fruit, anything that is bound up with pollution, constitutes in its entirety nothing but suffering. The entirety of the mental poisons and karma, anything that is of this kind, constitutes its cause, the origination of all suffering.

Thereupon they have to abandon the cause that has generated this disease, such as unhealthy food and so on. They have to attain the happy state of freedom from sickness and to do so rely on good medicine, the means to achieve this aim. Similar to this example, those who have the intelligence of wish­ing to get rid of the suffering of samsara and to attain the happiness of nirvana must first understand what suffering is. They must recognize that the whole of samsara, which consists of the fruit of anything bound up with pollution, is in its entirety nothing but suffering. Upon this recognition they have to remove its cause, the origination of all suffer­ing, to its full extent. This consists of karma and the mental poisons. They must come into direct contact with the cessation [of suffering], which is free from these stains, and attain the happiness of nirvana.

The way the immediate purpose and the intrinsic pur­pose is achievedIt is not obvious that one could act without exerting deliberate effort.Therefore nine examples are taught to cut the doubts of the disciples.The place where these nine examples were explained in very great detail is the sutra which through its very name teaches their necessity and purpose.Adorned with the far-reaching light of knowledge arisen from hearing it, those of insight will quickly enter the field of experience of a buddha.For ordinary beings it is not at all obvious that someone could act in spontaneous ways and that his actions could come about without the slightest need of deliberate effort and labor. Ordinary beings can­not see that, as such activity does not form an object of their under­standing. For this reason, doubts will arise when the disciples reflect: \"If the activity of a buddha is free from deliberate effort, and [yet] acts in such a way that it spontaneously fulfils the benefit of sentient be­ings, there is a contradiction!\" In order to eliminate and cut such doubts, [arisen from] mental poisons, the nine examples of the reflection of Indra and so on are used to explain very clearly in what way action is carried out without involving deliberate effort.

It says there:Bodhisatttvas who have gained insight will understand these su­preme words of the Buddha and the commentaries on their in­tended meaning.

Applying the examples in three waysAll streams of effort being fully appeased and the mind being free from all ideation is similar to Indra's reflection appearing within stainless lapis lazuli and so forth.Appeasement of effort is the proposition; mind free from ideation its justification.In order to establish the meaning of this nature the similes of Indra's form and so on are given.When perfect buddhas accomplish the benefit of others, they mani­fest in such a way that all streams or channels of deliberate effort in­volving a focus [of perception] are totally appeased without any ex­ception. This is because final and ultimate compassion, which is by nature clear light, has revealed itself directly. This compassion is such that all thoughts are totally eliminated, and it is without any ideation. This is similar to the example of the reflection of Indra, the lord of the gods, appearing in the world of humans once the ground has turned into flawless lapis lazuli. Here, as in the other examples, action takes place though there is no exertion of deliberate effort. [Buddha activity is to be understood] accordingly. In this context, with the statement: \"All streams of deliberate effort involving a focus [of perception] are totally appeased\" the proposition or thesis (Tib. dam bca) is evolved. And the statement: \"since the final and ultimate mind free from all ideation has revealed itself directly\" constitutes the justification or proof of this thesis (Tib. gtan tshigs). In order to establish the meaning of a nature that represents spontaneous accomplishment of the ben­efit of others, and yet is free from any deliberate effort whatsoever, as an object of understanding of the disciples, there are the examples of the reflection of Indra, the sound of the great drum, and so on, as given in the foregoing sections. Through these this nature is illustrated.B.IL2.2.2.4.3.2.2.1.4. The meaning of the chapter is freedom from deliberate effortHere the meaning of the chapter is as follows:The nine aspects of physical display and so on [show] that the Teacher has no birth and death, and yet perfectly manifests without any effort.Here, in this chapter treating buddha activity, its meaning illustrated by means of examples is as follows: Through the nine points explained before (i.e. the aspects of display of illusory physical appearance,"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"276 Buddha Natureverbalizing instruction, and so on), the Teachers, the perfect buddhas, are shown to perfectly manifest, though they are free from being born, dying, and so on—they are rid of all compounded phenomena.

The different kinds of examplesSomething that, similar to Indra, the drum, clouds, Brahma, the sun, the precious king of wish-granting gems, an echo, space,and the earth, effortlessly and as long as existence may last fulfils others' benefit is only conceived of by [supreme] yogis.Buddha activity is something spontaneous and uninterrupted. It is explained in nine examples that illustrate it quite closely. In these it is shown as being similar to the reflection of Indra, to the sound of the great drum, to the way in which clouds pervade the sky, to the illu­sory emanation of Brahma, to the light rays of the sun, to a mighty king of supremely precious wish-fulfilling gems, to an echo resound­ing from a rock, and so on: that is, to the great element of space, and to the ground of the earth, which provides the support for everything else. The way in which activity unfolds, accomplishing the benefit of others in such a way that it is spontaneous and free from deliberate effort, and at the same time uninterrupted, [not ceasing] as long as the existences of endless samsara may last, is [only] conceived of by those yogis who are utterly supreme [i.e. a buddha himself]. For ordinary beings, though, it is inconceivable.B.I1.2.2.2A.3.2.2.2.2.

Similar to this example there is the appearance of physical form. A buddha, without moving from the dharmakaya, dis­plays an endless number of illusory form kayas to disciples who have karmic fortune.(2) Likewise, in order to incite those not practicing meditation to do so, and to fully liberate those who practice meditation, there is the advice of speech. The way in which the teaching resulting from this advice is well explained is similar to the great drum of the gods ex­pounding the Four Great Guiding Principles of Dharma.(3) Buddhas embody pervasiveness in that their minds embrace all the knowable. Thus there is primordial wisdom that knows correctly and completely. They have great compassionate concern, consisting of the wish to free [all sentient beings] from the suffering of samsara. Filled with this wish they are like hosts of clouds reaching everywhere. Their manifestations pervade all sentient beings, all their disciples be­yond any count, wherever they dwell, up to the peak of existence.(4) Just as Brahma shows appearance in the desire realm without moving away from the realm of form, a buddha perfectly displays a manifold number of different physical and verbal appearances in ac­cordance with his own aspiration, and yet does not move away at all from the unpolluted abode of the dharmadhatu.(5) As the sun disperses the brilliance of its light rays, a buddha based upon primordial wisdom perfectly radiates brilliant light rays of the sacred Dharma, beyond any end in number.(6) A buddha has the inconceivable secret aspect of mind which, though totally free from ideation, grants all wishes and needs. In this respect there is similarity to a supremely precious wish-fulfilling jewel, which is utterly pure and free from stain."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"278 Buddha Nature(7) Just like an echo resounding from a rock and so on, the secret aspect of the speech of all perfect buddhas is heard in various ways, and yet does not exist as the essence of letters [the basis of words and names].(8) The secret aspect of the body is similar to space in that it per­vades everything, is permanent, and appears in various shapes and so on, and yet does not exist as form.(9) As the earth provides the basis for the arising and growth of crops and so on, a buddha is the basis for all medicinal plants without excep­tion, these being the unstained virtuous qualities of all sentient beings, immeasurable in number. Buddhas provide the ground that makes all these crops flourish in the streams of being of the disciples, making them firm, stable, wide, and expanded in every respect. Such is the at­tainment of the level of all buddhas who are endowed with great com­passion; it represents a total transformation of state in every respect and without exception.

The zoay there is appearance and yet freedom from birthand deathB.II222A.32.3.1.1. The example of [dependence on] facultiesThe cause for the Buddha to be seen in the mind similar to pure lapis lazuli is the purity of this ground,[achieved] by a firm faculty of irreversible faith.Since virtue arises and ceases,the form of a buddha arises and ceases.Like Indra, the Muni who is dharmakaya is free from arising and ceasing.If buddhas are always free from arising and ceasing, one may won­der for what reason they are seen as if they were arising and ceasing. Based upon the gathering of the roots of virtue, the surface of the earth transforms into pure lapis lazuli. The kaya of all perfect buddhas will be clearly seen in one's own mind once the mind has become lucid and free from pollution, being thus [comparable to] the pure lapis la­zuli. The cause of this seeing, or in other words, the means that purify the mind, are the faculties of faith and so on (i.e. of diligence, mindful­ness, samadhi, and discriminative wisdom) having become extremely firm and stable through no longer being reversed by anything belong­ing to the unconducive side, such as lack of confidence and so on. In the context [of the example], the reflection will appear and disappear"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 279due to the surface of the earth being pure or impure, respectively. Simi­larly the roots of virtue of the disciples, their faith and other qualities, arise and cease. Due to this arising and ceasing, respectively, the rela­tive form kayas of all buddhas appear as if they were arising and ceas­ing. Nevertheless, the own essence of Indra does not move away from the thirty-three [divine] abodes. Likewise the omniscient Muni is the ultimate dharmakaya, which does not suffer any change. For this rea­son the own essence of a buddha is free from arising and ceasing.3.11212.4.32.312. The way it is free from birth and death, since it is uninterruptedEffortlessly, like [Indra] he manifests his deeds, displaying [physical appearance] and so forth, from birthless and deathless dharmakaya for as long as samsaric existence may last.Further, one may wonder for what reason activity emerges effort­lessly and uninterruptedly. Though Indra and the other examples are free from deliberate effort, they bring about the benefit of others through their reflection shining forth and so on. Likewise, all buddhas \"are also free from any kind of deliberate effort in terms of ideation, intention, and so on. They do not depart from birthless and deathless dharmakaya, which has immediately revealed itself. In this effortless and unmoving way they manifest their spontaneous deeds uninter­ruptedly and ever-presently, as long as samsara is not emptied and the endless existences of the disciples may last. They display illusory appearances through [the aspect of] body, express instruction through [the aspect of] speech, pervade everything with their knowledge and compassionate love through [the aspect of] mind, and so on.3.1122.2.4.3.2.3.2.

Whatever aspect is a non-corresponding property is gradually eliminated by the following examples. Thus it is expressed by teaching in terms of corresponding qualities.B.1L2.2.2.4.3.2.3.2.2. Detailed explanationA buddha is like the reflection, and yet dissimilar, since the reflection is not endowed with his melody.He is like the drum of the gods, and yet dissimilar, since the drum does not bring benefit everywhere.He is similar to a vast cloud, and yet dissimilar, since a cloud does not eliminate worthless seeds.He is like the mighty Brahma, and yet dissimilar, since Brahma does not continuously cause maturity.He is like the orb of the sun, and yet dissimilar, since the sun does not always overcome darkness.He is like a wish-granting gem, and yet dissimilar, since the gem's appearance is not so rarely found.He is similar to an echo, and yet dissimilar, since an echo arises from cause and condition.He is similar to space, and yet dissimilar, since space is not a ground of pure virtue.Being the lasting basis for every goodness, the best possible for all without exception, for worldly beings and those beyond the world,[activity] is similar to the mandala of earth.Because based upon all buddhas' enlightenment, the path beyond the world will arise, as will the path of virtuous deeds, mental stability, and the immeasurable and formless contemplations.(1) The unfolding of the activity of all perfect buddhas is similar to the reflection of Indra appearing in the lapis lazuli surface of the earth, inasmuch as an endless number of illusory physical manifestations is displayed. Nevertheless, the form [of Indra] does not wield a melody, whereas a buddha possesses the melody of his speech expounding the Dharma. For this reason there is a dissimilarity and [a buddha] is more excellent than that.(2) [Buddha activity] is similar to the great drum of the gods teach­ing the Four Guiding Principles of Dharma, inasmuch as through the melody of his speech expounding the Dharma various instructions are given. Nevertheless, the great drum is not such that it brings benefit"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lions Roar 281in whichever direction wished for, whereas a buddha accomplishes benefit pervading all the worlds of the disciples. For this reason there is again a dissimilarity and [a buddha] is more excellent than that.(3) Viewing the aspect that it pervades all world spheres, buddha activity, which matures all disciples by means of knowledge and com­passionate love, has properties similar to those of a vast cloud, which all-pervasively causes the ripening of crops. Nevertheless, a cloud does not eliminate worthless seeds, whereas a buddha causes the elimina­tion of everything that is worthless, of all afflictions such as desire and so on. For this reason there is a further dissimilarity and [a buddha] is more excellent than that.(4) Viewing the aspect of eliminating worthless seeds, the display of an endless number of illusory appearances is similar to the illusory manifestation of Mahabrahma eliminating the attachment to sense gratifications. Nevertheless, Brahma only brings benefit one time and thus does not continuously cause maturity, whereas a buddha always and uninterruptedly leads the disciples' streams of being to full matu­ration. For this reason there is again a dissimilarity and [a buddha] is more excellent than that.(5) Viewing the aspect that all crops, which are the disciples, are continuously lead to maturation, the radiation of an infinite number of light rays of primordial wisdom is similar to the orb of the sun con­tinuously ripening all crops by means of its light beams. Neverthe­less, the sun only shines alternately. It does not always overcome dark­ness, doing so day and night, whereas a buddha always and uninter­ruptedly overcomes the darkness of unknowing. For this reason, again there is a dissimilarity and [a buddha] is more excellent than that.(6) Viewing the aspect of darkness being overcome continuously, the secret aspect of mind, radiating the light of totally thought-free primordial wisdom, is similar to a wish-fulfilling gem that through its brilliance continuously overcomes darkness, doing so day and night. Nevertheless, the jewel being present among Nagas and so on, and even among animals, its occurrence is not so hard to find, whereas a buddha does not appear to sentient beings who lack karmic fortune and is thus very hard to find [for those beings]. For this reason there is another dissimilarity and [a buddha] is more excellent than that.(7) Viewing the aspect of his appearance being difficult to encoun­ter, the secret aspect of speech excellently explaining various teach­ings is similar to an echo being difficult to encounter, since it does not truly exist either outside or inside [its source]. Nevertheless, an echo"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"282 Buddha Natureoccurs in dependence on adventitious conditions, whereas a buddha, being self-sprung and uncreated, does not appear due to causes and conditions. For this reason there is a further dissimilarity and [a buddha] is more excellent than that.(8) Viewing the aspect that [buddha activity] is truly uncreated and does not arise from causes and conditions, the secret aspect of body, displaying an infinite number of totally illusory manifestations, is simi­lar to space, which appears as a variety of things and is yet uncreated. Nevertheless, space does not become a basis or ground for virtue, whereas a buddha becomes the basis or ground of all unstained virtu­ous properties. For this reason there is again a dissimilarity and [a buddha] is more excellent than that.(9) [Buddha activity] becomes the basis and lasting ground of ev­ery goodness without exception, of everything that is best for worldly beings and beings beyond the worldly. For this reason it is similar to the great mandala of the earth, which provides the basis for every­thing. One may wonder why [a buddha] forms the ground of all [good­ness]. This is because the attainment of the great enlightenment of all buddhas constitutes the basis on which the sacred teachings arise. These consist of the three vehicles and so on, constituting the path that leads beyond the worldly. As it is stated in the Madhyamakavatara (Tib. dbu mci la 'jug pa): . .the shravakas, the mediocre buddhas, andthe Lords of Munis [i.e. pratyekabuddhas and perfect buddhas] will arise.\" Based upon this [great enlightenment], the paths of the ten vir­tuous actions will arise, constituting the cause of the best possible [feat] of the desire realm. The four stages of meditative stability and the immeasurable contemplations will come about, constituting the cause of the best possible [achievement] of the realm of form. And the form­less states of resting evenly in meditative equipoise, constituting the cause of the best possible [feat] of the formless realm, will arise as well.

The phase in which this buddha element is completely and thoroughly purified from all the adventitious stains is the attainment of the great awakening or enlightenment of a buddha.

Presentation of the reason for this excellenceWhy [is it so beneficial]? Generosity only yields wealth, discipline leads to the higher states of existence, and meditation removes affliction.Discriminative wisdom fully abandons all afflictions and [hindrances to] knowledge.It is therefore supreme, and its cause is studying these.One may wonder why it has such great benefit. When not held by discriminative wisdom, extensive generosity will only yield material wealth, extensive discipline will only lead to the higher states of exist­ence, and meditation will only remove the afflictions in terms of sup­pressing them and keeping them down. As opposed to that, the dis­criminative wisdom realizing the four vajra points totally abandons all the veils of the afflictions and hindrances to knowledge along with their remaining imprints. For this reason, discriminative wisdom re­alizing the profound ultimate nature is supremacy itself, and by far more excellent than generosity and so on. Therefore, there are special benefits of a training in the frame of which one studies and reflects upon the sublime words of the Buddha teaching the four vajra points. This is due to the fact that there is only one cause for the realization represented by the discriminative wisdom, which is far more excel­lent than the virtue resulting from the three [practices] of generosity and so on. This single cause consists of studying the sublime words of the Buddha teaching the four vajra points, of thereupon having faith in them, and training oneself [as to their meaning].B.II.3.1.5. Very detailed explanation of the benefit B.II.3.1.5.1. Attainment of enlightenmentThe presence [of the element], its result, its qualities, and the achievement of benefit are the objects of understanding of a buddha.When towards these four, as explained above, one of understanding is filled with devotion to their presence, ability, and qualities, he will be quickly endowed with the fortune by which one attains the state of a tathagata."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 287The element forming the ground to be realized, which has been present since beginningless time, enlightenment, which is tire realiza­tion transforming the element's state, the qualities, which are the branches of enlightenment, and its action, which is the activity ac­complishing the benefit of others, are the objects of understanding of a buddha. Those bodhisattvas possessed of understanding who train themselves in an unperverted way with regard to these four points, as explained above, will quickly harvest the benefit of attaining enlight­enment. Devotion towards the fact that the element is present in all sentient beings, that it wields the ability of reaching enlightenment, and that enlightenment has been indivisibly endowed with qualities since beginningless time, will transform into the karmic fortune of quickly attaining the state of a tathagata.B.II.3.1.5.2.

There will be discriminative wisdom perfectly and thoroughly discerning all phenomena, and so on.

Attainment of complete perfection[Bodhichitta] being ever-present in them the heirs of the Victor will not fall back.The perfection of merit will be refined until being transformed into total purity.Once these five perfections of merit are not ideated in threefold division, they will become perfect and fully pure, as their opposite facets are abandoned.Since bodhichitta, as explained before, is ever-present in them, the heirs of the Victor will not fall back from unsurpassable enlightenment. Wholeheartedly inspired and uplifted by this particular motivation they will fully refine the first five perfections, and transform these into total purity. The first five perfections represent the aspect of ap­plication or the accumulation of merit, of generosity, and so on, con­stituting the means to be of benefit and help to all sentient beings. Then further, not ideating the three circles of actor, action, and the one towards whom the action is directed, these perfections are refined into supremacy.

Definition of the accumulationsThe merit of generosity arises from giving, that of morality arises from moral conduct.The two aspects of patience and meditative stability stem from meditation, and diligence accompanies all.Formerly, merit was explained as the three aspects of generosity, ethical conduct, and meditation. So one may wonder whether it does not follow that, of the six perfections, three are to be considered as the accumulation of merit and three as the accumulation of primordial wisdom. The first five perfections are considered as being the accu­mulation of merit.

Depiction of the veils to be abandonedWhatever ideates [in terms of] the three circles is viewed as the veil of the hindrances to knowledge.Whatever is the impulse of avarice and so on is to be regarded as the veil of the mental poisons.When it is said: \"Discriminative wisdom totally abandons all the afflictions and [hindrances to] knowledge,\" one may wonder which are the two veils to be abandoned by discriminative wisdom. Any ideation in terms of the three circles—of the giver, the object to whom one is giving, and the action of giving—and so forth is considered to be the veil of the hindrances to knowledge. It constitutes the obstruc­tion to the first five paramitas becoming fully perfected. Any ideation of avarice, desire, anger, sloth, total distraction, and so on is consid­ered to be the veil of the mental poisons. It constitutes the obstruction to the first five perfections becoming totally pure. Thus these [two veils] are to be abandoned.B.II.3.1.5.5.2. Explanation of wisdom being the supreme remedySince apart from discriminative wisdom there is no other cause to remove these [veils], this discriminative wisdom is supreme.Its ground being study, such study is supreme.Since it realizes points such as those [discussed here] in the most excellent way, apart from discriminative wisdom there is no other cause that will eliminate the two veils at their very root. Generosity and so on, when devoid of discriminative wisdom, can only suppress the di­rect manifestation of the veils but cannot eliminate them to the extent of uprooting their seeds. As opposed to that, the perfection of dis­criminative wisdom has the ability to eliminate the seeds of the two veils and their remaining imprints up to their very root. For this rea­son, discriminative wisdom, which forms the accumulation of primor­dial wisdom, is supreme and more excellent than the five perfections of merit. The ground that will increase such discriminative wisdom is learning the sublime words of the Buddha, which teach subjects such as these four vajra points, along with the commentaries explaining their intended meaning, and doing so in the proper fashion.

Equally it is based on direct recognition in yoga, and on many logical arguments that cut all exaggerative and depreciating [views]. I have composed this Commentary on the Highest Continuity in a meaningful way [for two reasons. The first is] to purify the nature of the veils up to the last single seed and remaining im­print. [The second is] to support all those disciples who have the dis­position to the Great Vehicle and whose understanding is endowed with the best possible virtue of devotion.B.1I.3.2.2. The basis on which it was composedAs someone with eyes sees by relying on a lamp, or on lightning, a jewel, the sun, or the moon, this has been truly explained by relying on the Muni, brilliant in meaning, words, phenomena, and power.Relying on the outer primary condition, which is the light of a butter- lamp, of lightning, a gem, the sun, or the moon, an individual en­dowed with a clear consciousness of sight, forming the inner primary condition, will perceive visible things. Seeing them in an unperverted way this individual can also explain them to others. Likewise this Com­mentary on the Highest Continuity has been well explained by relying on the sublime words of the Muni as the outer primary condition. The Muni is endowed with insight into all knowable phenomena by radi­ating the light of the four kinds of individual and authentic awareness (Tib. so so yang dag par rig pa bzhi). [The first of these four is] individual"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 291and authentic awareness of the meaning (Tib. don), which is equivalent to knowing the intrinsic and general characteristics of all phenomena. [The second is] individual and authentic awareness of the words (Tib. tshig), which is equivalent to knowing all denotations without excep­tion. [The third is] individual and authentic awareness of phenom­ena, which is equivalent to knowing all synonymous names without exception. [The fourth is] individual and authentic awareness of self- reliance and fearless power (Tib. spobs), which is equivalent to know­ing all knowable objects in an unhindered and unobstructed way. The inner primary condition that was relied upon [when composing this text] is the immediate seeing of the tathagatagarbha by means of the eye of discriminative wisdom. (See also Part Three, annotation 81.)B.1I.3.2.3. Definition of the words of the BuddhaWhatever speech is meaningful and well connected with Dharma, which removes all afflictions of the three realms and shows the benefit of the [attainment] of peace, is the speech of the Sage, while any different speech is other.Any exalted speech having the four following particular properties islhe command of the Victorious One, the sublime speech of the Great Sage, the Buddha: Whatever is expressed holds great meaning and benefit. The words that are the means of expression are well connected with stainless Dharma. Its function is such that it causes elimination of all the afflictions of the three realms of existence. It demonstrates the fruit, showing the benefit of nirvana as being peace, [the state be­yond any torment and pain]. Any speech connecting one with [the elimination of all affliction and the attainment of peace] is equivalent to the sacred words of the Buddha. As opposed to that, anything else, since it is different from his command, should not be followed.B.IL3.2.4. Explanation that everything according with the Buddhas words should be acceptedWhatever someone has explained with undistracted mind, exclusively in the light of the Victor's teaching, and conducive to the path of attaining release, one should place on one's head as the words of the Sage.Whichever scriptures have been composed by an author with undistracted mind, solely in the light of the Victor's teaching, exclu­sively expressing its meaning, and thus elucidating all the words of"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"292 Buddha Naturethe Buddha and granting excellent explanation conducive to the at­tainment of the fruit, which is the path leading to liberation, should be placed on the head as the words of the Sage, of the Buddha himself. The reason is that these completely pure scriptures, which comment the intended meaning of the [Buddha's words], are in the likeness of these words themselves.B.1I.3.2.5. One should not teach contradicting the Buddhas zuordsThere is no one in this world more skilled in Dharma than the Victor.No other has such insight, knowing everything without exception [and knowing] supreme thatness the way it is.Thus one should not distort the sutras presented by the Sage himself,since this would destroy the Muni's manner [of teaching] and furthermore cause harm to the sacred Dharma.Compared to the Victor, the Perfect Buddha, there is no one in this world as skilled in Dharma. There is no other who has such knowl­edge consisting of the primordial wisdom that directly knows all as­pects, perceiving them the way they are and in an unperverted man­ner. The Buddha's primordial wisdom knows completely and knows correctly. Thus he knows the whole range of the knowable, as much as there is, without any exception, and he knows everything as it is, in terms of supreme thatness. For this reason whichever sutras the great Sage himself has presented in terms of a definitive and a provisional meaning should not be adulterated and explained in a false way. They should not be distorted through self-styled artifices, such as calling a meaning requiring interpretation a definitive meaning, and a defini­tive meaning a provisional one. For if one does so, the way in which the Perfect Buddha [has expounded] his pure teaching will be de­stroyed. One will further cause harm to the sacred Dharma and fall into the great evil of abandoning it.B.1I.3.2.6. Explanation of the fault of contradiction B.ll.3.2.6.1.

All of this is produced by an inferior view fixated upon one's very own doctrine. Since any holding on to inferior tenets twists what is self-sprung into something bound up with pollution, one should not join one's mind with such fixed and opinionated view. It is suit­able, for instance, to transform a clean cloth that is free from stains through color into various hues, but it is not suitable to [treat] such cloth with oil.BAI.3.2.6.1.2. The ten direct causes for abandoning the DharmaDue to a feeble intellect, lack of striving for virtue, reliance on false pride, a nature obscured by neglect of pure Dharma, taking the provisional for the definitive meaning—for thatness, craving for profit, being under the sway of [inferior] views, relying on those disapproving [of Dharma], staying away from those who uphold the teachings, and due to mean devotion, the teachings of the Foe- Vanquishers are abandoned.It is taught [in the scriptures]: \"Thus the definitive meaning, the final and ultimate essence of the teachings of the Great Vehicle, is su­premely profound and possesses great benefit.\" This being so, one might wonder: How could anyone not have devotion and thus totally abandon it? This is not the fault of the Dharma but the fault of such an individual. This relates to the fact that a person will abandon the sa­cred Dharma for the following [ten] reasons:(1) Discriminative wisdom thoroughly investigating the profound meaning is faint and a person's understanding and intellectual capac­ity are extremely feeble.(2) Since the disposition to be expanded has not been awakened, there is total lack of striving for unstained virtuous properties.(3) A person relies on false pride, nourishing the conceited idea: \"I have qualities!\" while what he believes to be a quality is not one at all.(4) In former lives a person has accumulated the karma through which the sacred Dharma is abandoned, doing so very intensively"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"294 Buddha Natureand to a great extent. For this reason this person has the nature of being obscured [and blinded] with respect to truth.(5) The sublime words of the Buddha expressing the provisional meaning are mistakenly held to be a definitive meaning, which is that- ness, [the true nature] of all phenomena.(6) A person is in the grip of very strong craving and greed for the profits of sense gratifications, such as food, clothing, wealth, and so on.(7) A person is under the sway of being totally fixated upon and indoctrinated by inferior views, such as the views belonging to the transitory collection, and so on.(8) A person has fallen to the influence of evil friends, having relied on them for a very long time, having totally forsaken the sacred Dharma, and having disapproved of and noisily opposed its deep and vast aspects.(9) Likewise, for a very long time, a person has stayed away from those who have the characteristics of a saintly being, from spiritual friends who uphold the sacred teachings of the Great Vehicle.(10) A person has mean devotion and aspiration, in that he delights in what is harmful and wrong, while there is no faith and confidence in the true Dharma and in pure beings.These are the reasons why the sacred teaching of the tathagatas who have vanquished all foes is abandoned; there is hardly any need to mention that in this way especially the instructions on profound that- ness are forsaken. Since this will also damage and cause deterioration of one's own being, those who are skillful will not act like that.B.U.3.2.6.2.

They should not be as afraid of being burnt by a raging fire, eaten by a cruel poisonous snake, killed by a murderer, or struck by lightning. These"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"The Unassailable Lion's Roar 295are irrelevant, since the loss of Dharma is to be feared far more than them. When we die from fire, a snake, an enemy, or a thunderbolt, this only has the power to separate us from this very life; it cannot make us go into the evil wanderings, into the utterly fearful states of the hells infested with direst pain (Skt. Avici). Whereas, when abandoning the sacred Dharma, one will experience the suffering of the Avici hell.B.ll.3.2.6.3. Explanation that abandoning the Dharma is more grave than the immeasurably negative actsEven someone who has relied on evil friends again and again and thus heeded harmful intentions towards a buddha, who has committed one of the most heinous acts—killing his father, mother, or an arhat, or splitting the sublime Assembly—will be quickly released from these, once genuinely reflecting the dharmata.But where would liberation be for someone whose mind is hostile to Dharma?An individual may have relied again and again on evil and mis­leading friends and thus may have wounded a buddha's body, spill­ing his blood in the harmful intention of wanting to kill him. He may have committed one of the three most severe acts of killing his father, his mother, or an arhat. Or he may have created a rift in the sublime Assembly, causing division among its members. Even such a person will be quickly released from the karma of the immeasurably nega­tive acts once he closely and genuinely reflects suchness or the dharmata, which is the way in which everything really exists. But where would liberation be for an individual whose mind is hostile to the teaching of the Great Vehicle and who therefore abandons the sa­cred Dharma? There is no [possibility of] release for such an individual. Since the negativity of abandoning the Dharma is even more severe than having committed the immeasurably negative acts, one should always refrain from this great evil.B.II.3.3.

They are called \"noble\" since due to this realiza­tion they have reached a higher level of mental development than an ordinary being.(4) Within the system of the Madhyamaka, \"Rangtong Madhya- maka\" and \"Shantong Madhyamaka\" (Tib. dbu ma rang stong dang dbu ma gzhan stong) are distinguished. Literally, Rangtong means \"self- empty\" and Shantong \"empty of other.\" In the view of the Rangtong Madhyamaka, \"the expanse by nature completely pure\" refers to the fact that all phenomena are by nature not truly existent. It is equiva­lent to emptiness in the sense of complete freedom from conceptual elaboration (Tib. spros pa). In the view of the Shantong Madhyamaka it is the nature of mind, being the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness (Tib. dbyings rig dbyer med).(5) The defilements from which the element or the tathagatagarbha is purified in the state of enlightenment are the adventitious stains of delusion with regard to appearances, or in other words, the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge.(6) The term \"fruit of freedom\" is used from the viewpoint of com­plete freedom from all the defilements consisting of delusion with re­gard to appearances. With this freedom, the thirty-two qualities of the dharmakaya are attained. The fruit of complete maturation results from the fact that the accumulation of merit has been led to complete matu­rity. It consists of the thirty-two qualities of the form kayas.(7) When having reached ultimate direct realization, one has dis­posal over the means causing all other beings to gain this realization. This is buddha activity, which consists of the power or ability of the qualities, or in other words, of the fact that one wields great qualities, those of freedom and complete maturation.Annotation 2:When speaking of the qualities, those of the path and the fruit are to be distinguished. The qualities of the path are those present while the state of buddhahood is not yet reached, which are present on the paths of accumulation, of junction, of seeing, and of meditation. The qualities present on the path of no more learning are the qualities of the fruit."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"302 Buddha NatureNagarjuna's words are to be understood as follows: If the element is present and one practices the sacred Dharma, thus purifying one­self from the defilements, one will attain the fruit on the support of this purification. If the element was not present, not the slightest fruit would be attained, even though one practiced the Dharma and puri­fied oneself from the defilements. This can be illustrated by means of an example: If ore bears gold and is processed, one will obtain gold. If ore is not gold-bearing, no gold will emerge, no matter how long one processes it. The view as it is expressed by Nagarjuna's words corre­sponds to that of the Uttara Tantra Shastra. Nagarjuna has composed two collections of works, which are called \"Collection of Reasonings\" (Tib. dbu ma rig pa'i tshogs drug) and \"Collection of Praises\" (Tib. dbu ma stod tshogs). The Dharmadhatustava belongs to the latter. The collec­tion of reasonings contains the view of the second turning of the wheel of Dharma, while the collection of praises contains the approach of the third turning of the wheel of Dharma, which corresponds to the Shantong view.When the element, or in other words, the dharmadhatu, the insepa­rable union of spaciousness and awareness, is described as being by nature completely pure, this means that it is not to be considered as something that is formerly impure and later purified. It is equivalent to the way the mind exists—as the inseparable union of emptiness and clear light. It is always by nature pure, even though the adventi­tious defilements, which do not affect this purity, have to be removed, just as the dross needs to be removed in order to obtain the pure gold contained therein.Annotation 3:\"The expanse of the equality of all phenomena\" can be explained as follows: The term \"phenomena\" refers to all outer and inner phenom­ena, that is, to the phenomena of the basis and to those of the fruit. The phenomena of the fruit consist of the fruits of the three vehicles; the phenomena of the basis comprise all phenomena of samsara with­out exception. The fact that there is no difference with regard to the essence of phenomena is called \"equality.\" How this is to be under­stood is often explained through the example of dream. While dream­ing, fire and water are equal, as are light and darkness, in that they are equally not truly existent. With regard to their essence there is no dif­ference. The expanse of equality is therefore the expanse of the empti­ness of all phenomena."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"The term \"primary condition\" is to be understood by the way in which, for example, the sense faculty of the eye constitutes the pri­mary condition for the eye to perceive visible objects. Without its sense faculty the eye could not perceive anything. Likewise, the presence of the qualities is necessary as they are the primary condition for the manifestation of the inconceivable activity of a buddha's body, speech, and mind. If the qualities were not present, a buddha would not be able to act spontaneously and without deliberate effort for the benefit of all sentient beings.Annotation 4:The term \"name and form\" (Tib. minggzugs) refers to the five skandhas: form (Skt. rüpa, Tib. gzugs), feelings (Skt. vedaná, Tib. tshor ba), dis­crimination (Skt. samjña, Tib. fdu shes), compositional factors (Skt. samskara, Tib. 'du byed), and consciousness (Skt. vijñána, Tib. mam shes). The term is used because, other than form, the remaining four can only be grasped by a name.When speaking of doubts about the truth and about action and its fruit, this refers to two things: the first are doubts about the meaning or validity of the Four Noble Truths or of the two truths, which are the absolute and the relative truth. The second are doubts about the fact that the practice of virtue acts as the cause giving rise to the fruit of happiness, the fact that suffering will arise on the basis of unvirtuous action, and so on.The views belonging to the fearful or transitory collection (Skt. satkáyadrsti, Tib. fig tshogs la Ita ba [the text translated here reads 'jigs tshogs) are views such as taking the skandhas as a self or as something that belongs to this self, and so forth. There are twenty of these de­scribed, for instance, in the Madhyamakavatara (Tib. dbu ma la 'jug pa) by Chandrakirti. For further information in English, see Jeffrey Hopkins, Meditation on Emptiness (Boston: Wisdom Publications, 1983), pp. 176 f., 258 f.Annotation 5:The usage of the terms \"subject matter\" (Tib. rdzas) and \"aspect\" (Tib. Idog pa) can be explained as follows: Taking a flower as an example, the flower itself is the subject matter. From the point of view that it has come into existence due to causes and conditions, the flower is com­pounded. From the point of view that it undergoes a process of de­struction taking place from instant to instant—that it is continuouslyExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 303"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"304 Buddha Naturenearing cessation—the flower is impermanent. This way of distinguish­ing two different features with regard to the flower is a classification in terms of different aspects. On the basis of the flower itself, however, whatever is compounded is impermanent and whatever is imperma­nent is compounded. These two aspects have just one essence. With regard to the essence there is no variety. Nevertheless, since the flower is able to appear to thought as having various different features, it gains an according variety in terms of verbal expression. These as­pects are a mere difference of terms; on the basis of the subject matter as such, all different aspects are indivisible.The terms \"subject matter\" and \"aspect\" play a very important role in the explanations of valid cognition (Tib. tshad ma). Having gained a proper understanding of the meaning of these terms, one will come to understand the way mind manifests. A subject matter is the object of the sense consciousnesses, which are free from thought. An aspect is the object of thought. When the eye-consciousness perceives a flower, it only perceives the subject matter. It does not perceive the flower in terms of \"this flower is white, red, compounded, impermanent,\" and so on. The conceptual mind makes these differences and divides the flower into various aspects, whereas the sense consciousness perceives the subject matter, or the individual characteristic (Tib. rang mtshan), of the sense-object just as it comes within the range of perception (Tib. bzhin shar du). Therefore the terms \"subject matter\" and \"aspect of the subject matter\" refer to the way in which an understanding that is free from thought and one that is bound up with thought manifest. It is very important that these two different ways of manifestation are un­derstood well.Annotation 6:Contrary to other worldly beings, arhats have an arising through a body of mental nature and a cessation in terms of an inconceivable type of death.The omniscient Rongton was an eminent scholar and the teacher of the Sixth Karmapa Tongwa Donden. He holds that buddhahood is uncreated in the sense of the fourth criterion of uncreatedness. Ac­cording to Rongton, the dharmakaya has the quality of uncreatedness since it does not appear to the disciples as something that arises and ceases, whereas the form kayas are created or compounded since these appear to the disciples as something that arises and ceases.When it is said that a buddha shows the path in accordance with the respective karmic fortune of the disciples, this means that he adapts"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"his teaching to their respective intelligence and mental capacities. To less gifted disciples he gives a teaching enabling them to reach the state of a shravaka arhat on the basis of the Shravaka Vehicle. He teaches the path of the pratyekabuddhas to disciples of middling gifts, while highly gifted disciples receive the teaching of the path of the Mahayana.The first three qualities of buddhahood, that is, those of being un­created, spontaneously present, and not a realization due to extrane­ous conditions, are the qualities of the dharmakaya, which constitutes the most excellent benefit for oneself. The last three qualities, that is, those of primordial wisdom of knowledge, compassionate love, and ability, are the qualities of the form kayas, which bring about the most excellent benefit of others.Annotation 7:(1) The expanse or the open dimension (Tib. dbyings), which is com­plete peace beyond any conceptual elaboration, having neither up nor down, neither middle nor end, is called the dharmadhatu (Tib. chos kyi dbyings). It is similar to the depth or sphere of space, which is extremely vast and open and does not obstruct anything. Suchness is equivalent to emptiness. The terms \"dharmadhatu,\" \"suchness,\" and \"absolute truth\" are synonymous in that both \"dharmadhatu\" and \"suchness\" denote emptiness, and the absolute truth is the way everything exists, which is also emptiness. In the context dealt with here, which is to say in the Shantong view, this emptiness is to be understood mainly in the sense of ultimate emptiness or the ultimate expanse. This is the nature of mind or the way the mind truly exists, being the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness or of emptiness and clear light. Ac­cording to the Madhyamaka, however, the nature of mind is to be understood solely from the point of view that all phenomena do not truly exist. In this view it is nothing but empty in the sense of not being accessible to any conceptualization. It is very important to gain a proper understanding of these two different views. What is mainly taught in the system to which the Uttara Tantra Shastra belongs is the aspect of awareness (Tib. rig pa) or clear light (Tib. od gsal), whereas in the system of the Madhyamaka the aspect of emptiness in the sense of freedom from conceptual elaboration is exclusively taught. If one un­derstands well what is meant by the inseparable union of emptiness and clear light, one comes very close to the path of the Vajrayana. In the system of the Vajrayana the nature of mind is then described as the inseparable union of clarity-emptiness (Tib. gsal stong), of bliss-Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 305"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"306 Buddha Natureemptiness (Tib. bde stong), of appearance-emptiness (Tib. snang stong), and of awareness-emptiness (Tib. rig stong). These are called the four \"joint manifestations\" (Tib. zung 'jug bzhi). Without knowing the mean­ing of the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness one will not be able to understand these. Not having studied the views as pre­sented in the Uttara Tantra Shastra and in the Madhyamaka system, one will not come to an understanding of the Vajrayana where the four joint manifestations are introduced. One would find oneself forced to leave the level of the Vajrayana \"already reached,\" in order to study the vehicle of characteristics that forms its basis. It is therefore advis­able to study this first. If, for example, someone learns how to fly a plane without being able to drive a car, he might one day have to learn how to drive while he can already fly. Since the first is also much more difficult than the latter, one had better keep the appropriate order. In brief, one should endeavor to study and understand the views of the Uttara Tantra Shastra and the Madhyamaka properly, since they equally constitute the cause of one's ability to follow the Vajrayana path.When it is said that the truth of cessation does not fall into the ex­treme of nihilism, this means that it does not fall into the extreme view of considering the absolute truth as being just empty in the sense of a bare nothingness or non-presence of anything. To describe this, the commentary partly uses words from the terminology of the Prasangika Madhyamaka. In this terminology the reasoning would be as follows: the truth of cessation does not fall into the extreme of nihilism, since it exists as the object of experience of self-sprung primordial wisdom.The literal meaning of the Tibetan term \"kiinzob\" (kun rdzob), which is here translated as \"relative,\" is \"false from every angle\" or \"decep­tive.\" A phenomenon is called \"adventitious\" when it comes into exist­ence as something fleeting and when it is able to be removed or aban­doned. An example for this is water containing mud, which will settle by itself when the water is not stirred, and which does not affect the purity of the water itself. Another example is defilements in the sky such as clouds or smoke, which also do not impair the purity of the sky and are dispelled by a breeze. By means of these examples one should understand that there are defilements in terms of mental poisons and obstructions to knowledge as long as the state of buddhahood is not reached, but that the nature or essence of mind has been pure since beginningless time and is not afflicted in the slightest by the adventi­tious stains of confusion, by the mental poisons and so on, which are"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"able to be removed. For this reason one can say: \"The dharma-dhatu, the absolute truth, does not fall into the extreme of etemalism, since it has been free from arising as a relative, adventitious thing since be­ginningless time.\" Generally speaking, the term \"etemalism\" refers to a view considering a subject that undergoes an arising and a ceas­ing as something that cannot be destroyed in any way. Here, in this context, the extreme of etemalism consists of a view holding a subject to be truly existent, to be inherently or of itself existent.The statement that the truth of cessation is completely freed from the conceptual elaboration that consists of the four extreme views, again stems from the terminology of the Prasangika Madhyamaka. According to this terminology the truth of cessation, that is, the dharmadhatu, the absolute truth, is completely freed from the four extreme beliefs in the non-existence of a subject, the existence of a subject, the simultaneous existence and non-existence of a subject, and a presence of a subject that is neither existent nor non-existent. There­fore it is completely freed from the conceptual elaboration that con­sists of the four extreme views.In the terminology of the scriptures explaining the dharmadhatu or the absolute truth, the name or the designation of a subject in ques­tion is called \"symbol\" (Tib. brda), whereas its properties are called \"terms\" (Tib. tha snyad). When a flower is called a \"flower,\" this is a symbol. When the flower is described as being white, red, or yellow, or as being impermanent, faded, and so on, these are terms. The dharmadhatu, or the ultimate absolute truth, is beyond symbols and it cannot be expressed by means of terms. As such it is completely beyond the field of activity of speech and is therefore inexpressible.The terms \"self-aware\" and \"other-aware\" denote two different types of perception. Whatever is perceived by the different sense consciousnesses—of the eye, the nose, and so on—is an other-aware perception. A self-aware perception does not focus outwards and per­ceive something else, but perceives its very own essence. At the time when emptiness or Mahamudra is realized, the essence of one's own mind is realized by itself in such a way that there is no duality be­tween an object to be realized and a realizing subject.The Dharma in terms of the truth of cessation has three qualities, the first being the fact that it is inconceivable. The commentary sub­stantiates this by successive proofs. When these are traced back, the reasoning is as follows:Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 307"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"308 Buddha Nature(1) The true nirvana of the noble ones, constituting the absolute truth, is the object of perception of the self-aware, or self­sprung, primordial wisdom of the noble ones, since it is not an object for an other-aware perception.(2) The absolute truth is not an object for an other-aware percep­tion since it cannot be explained by means of examples, logi­cal reasonings, and so forth.(3) It cannot be explained by means of examples, logical reason­ings, and so forth since it is inexpressible by means of symbols, terms, and so on and thus beyond the field of activity of speech.(4) It is beyond symbols, terms, and so on since any ideation is completely pacified.(5) All ideation is completely pacified since it is beyond the con­ceptual elaboration consisting of the four extreme views.An improper conceptual activity (Tib. tshnl bzhin ma yin pa'i mam par rtog pa) is a wrong way of thinking, such as taking something that is impure to be pure, something that does not exist as a self to be a self, and so on.(2) The literal meaning of the Tibetan term \"nyonmong\" (nyon mongs), which is here translated as \"mental poisons,\" is \"affliction.\" The mental poisons are an affliction since they oppress and afflict the mind and above all cause it suffering. The \"remaining imprints\" (Tib. bag chags) are to be understood as the after-effect or the remaining force (Tib. nus pa) of the mental poisons. If, for instance, a person has been drinking a considerable amount of alcohol over a long period of time and then stops doing so, he will still feel an urge from time to time, although he has given up his habit completely. The preceding behavior has an af­ter-effect, a remaining force. The traditional example is musk that has been put on a piece of paper. Even after a long time, when the musk itself is completely gone, the smell will still be noticeable.The truth of the path is mainly equivalent to the primordial wis­dom that directly realizes emptiness. The essence of this primordial wisdom is its utter purity, which is to be understood as complete pu­rification. It is utterly pure in the sense that the defilements of the mental poisons and their remaining imprints are eliminated and no longer present.The veil of the hindrances to knowledge mainly consists of the fol­lowing three aspects: the first is the fact that the so-called three circles (Tib. 'khor gsum) or complexes, that is, actor, object, and action, are perceived as something truly existent. This is the coarse aspect of the"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"obstructions to knowledge. A subtler aspect is the fact that the three complexes are perceived in terms of their characteristics. The third aspect consists of the fact that the three complexes appear as two. This perception of mere duality as such is the subtlest aspect of the veil of the hindrances to knowledge.Thus the truth of the path is primordial wisdom, which is free from the veil of the hindrances to knowledge. The \"brilliant light rays of the direct knowledge of all aspects\" are this primordial wisdom that directly realizes the true nature of all phenomena, or in other words, the absolute truth.Annotation 8:A conceptual understanding is any worldly understanding that per­ceives the relative.The three poisons are desire, aversion, and mental blindness.When speaking of the two truths comprising complete purification, the term \"complete purification\" refers to the following: Two parts are to be distinguished: that of complete purification (Tib. mam byang phyogs) and that of the mental poisons (Tib. nyon mongs phyogs). The first part includes the fruit of the process of purification, which is the state of utter purity from any defilement, as well as the means to bring about this purification. In the same way, the latter part includes the veils or obscurations as well as their causes.Annotation 9:The term \"freedom from attachment\" covers three aspects: the means that frees one from attachment, the basis to be freed from attachment, and the state of freedom from attachment.When one speaks of the two types of purity, the first type is the utter purity of the nature, which is to say that the nature of mind, or the element, the sugatagarbha, has been free from all defilements such as the mental poisons and so on since beginningless time. From the viewpoint of the essence, gold contained in ore is also pure gold. Cor­responding to this example, the nature of mind is completely pure. The second type of purity is freedom from the adventitious defile­ments. This is comparable to the purity achieved through processing the ore and removing the dross. Once the dross is completely removed there are two types of purity, the first being the purity that is also present while gold is contained in ore, and the second being the pu­rity achieved through the complete removal of the dross.Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 309"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"310 Buddha NatureAnnotation 10:When speaking of self-aware primordial wisdom present during medi­tation, this is to be understood as follows: \"meditation\" here refers to a condition of balanced equipoise in which one directly dwells within the true state (Skt. dharmata), or in other words, within emptiness, the nature of mind, which is the absolute truth or reality.The term \"self-aware\" is also part of the terminology of the Chitta- matra system (the Mind-Only School), yet is used there in another meaning. The system of the Chittamatra speaks of a self-aware con­sciousness. While the consciousnesses of the five senses focus out­wards and perceive outer objects, the mental sense-consciousness fo­cuses inwards and experiences by itself its own essence (Tib. rang gi ngo bo ranggis myong ba). In the system to which the Uttara Tantra Shastra belongs, however, the term \"self-aware\" denotes a realization that is self-sprung, by means of which the true state, the nature of mind, is realized directly, free from the duality of perceived and perceiver.A worldly understanding is the understanding of an ordinary being. This is any understanding that does not directly realize emptiness.Synonyms of the term \"suchness\" (Tib. de bzhin nyid) are the terms \"true state\" (Tib. chos nyid), \"emptiness\" (Tib. stong pa nyid), \"dharma­dhatu\" (Tib. chos kyi dbyings), or \"absolute truth\" (Tib. don dam pa'i bden pa).Annotation 11:When one has directly realized emptiness, one does not fall back to the level of the smaller vehicles. Since a bodhisattva, that is, a noble one, an heir of the Buddha (Tib. rgyal sras), has this realization, one speaks of the bodhisattvas who do not fall back.By the phrase \"their own minds have directly revealed themselves as being by nature clear light and functioning as the antidote...,\" the following is expressed: In the context explained here, \"one's own mind\" is equivalent to the nature of mind or to the way the relative mind truly exists. This is the true state of the mind, which is tire inseparable union of emptiness and clear light. It can be said to be an antidote since it is only the mind in terms of its true existence or state that counteracts the illusory appearances or the appearance of duality (Tib. gnyis snang).The fact that it has directly revealed itself (Tib. mngon sum du gyur pa), or in other words, that it is realized as it is, means the following: Two kinds of realization, direct realization (Tib. mngon sum) and inferred"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"realization (Tib. rjes dpag), are to be distinguished. These terms are also used within the teachings on valid cognition (Tib. tshad ma). Gen­erally speaking, the teachings on valid cognition represent \"that which makes the mind free from being confused and deluded.\" In this con­text all inferences and deductions taking place on the basis of sym­bols, characteristics, and logical reasonings are inferred valid cogni­tions (Tib. rjes dpag mtshan ma). A realization taking place without the support of these is a direct valid cognition (Tib. mngon sum tshad ma). Simply because it is in front of us, a flower, for instance, is perceived directly by means of the sense consciousness of the eye. This seeing, which is to say the sense consciousness perceiving the flower, is called direct valid cognition. If one makes inferences about the flower and finds that it is empty or does not exist as a self, the understanding perceiving it in such a way is an inferred valid cognition, since this understanding had to be derived. Put briefly, there are two ways of realizing any phenomenon: an inferred and a direct realization. The first takes place on the basis of symbols, characteristics, and logical reasonings. In the context of the second, the object is realized directly, without any obscuration and just as it appears.When the statement that the mind has revealed itself as being by nature clear light is seen in the light of the Shantong or Mahamudra views, it is equivalent to the direct or immediate realization of the nature of mind, or of the way the mind truly exists. The point at which one faces the nature of mind, the inseparable union of emptiness and clear light in which all conceptual elaboration has finally subsided, is called direct realization.The statement that the essence of the mental poisons has been free from arising since beginningless time refers to the following: The term \"arising\" means that something is by nature existent, truly existent, by its individual characteristics existent, and so on. Freedom from aris­ing is therefore equivalent to the fact that the subject matter in ques­tion is not truly existent and so on.Generally speaking, we all can notice that the mental poisons arise within us. Yet, this arising is but a relative one. It only comes about as a dependent origination, due to the meeting of causes and conditions. In truth the mental poisons are free from arising. This can be shown by the example of dream. While dreaming, all kinds of images arise. Whatever arises comes about interdependently as an illusory appear­ance. In truth these appearances are free from arising. Whatever ap­pears during a dream does not exist, not even in the form of a singleExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 311"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"322 Buddha Natureatom. Arising as something adventitious and being able to be removed like mud in water or clouds in the sky, the mental poisons are not truly existent. Their essence has been free from arising since beginning- less time. When one dreams, for example, and the appearances in this dream are seen differently as friend and enemy, aversion in view of the enemy and affection and desire in view of the friend will arise. These mental poisons are free from arising; they do not truly exist. Since the object is free from arising, the subject perceiving it is also free from arising, or in other words, not truly existent. In this sense one should reflect thoroughly. While one has a dream containing the duality of friend and enemy, and while as a reaction desire and aver­sion arise, the objects, that is, friend and enemy, do not truly exist. While friend and enemy do not truly exist, at the same time they form the basis for the arising of the mental poisons. These arise fleetingly and do not have an arising in terms of being truly existent. When the perceived object does not truly exist, it is not permissible to state that the perceiving subject is truly existent.When reflecting in this way, in my opinion the Chittamatra view constitutes a very deep approach for a beginner. The view of the Madhyamaka, for instance, is not directly realized until the first bodhi- sattva level is reached. Its realization will be attained when, on the path of junction, a view is cultivated that corresponds to that of the Chittamatra system. This has been stated by the omniscient Pema Karpo and others in many scriptural passages. When, while traveling the path of junction, one believes in the truth of the Madhyamaka view, but for the sake of its direct realization cultivates that of the Chitta­matra during one's meditation, these two aspects will become one.The passage \"therefore the bodhisattvas truly realize the nature of every being...\" is to be understood as follows: The nature of beings is equivalent to the way all beings truly exist. With regard to any subject matter, its way of existence (Tib. gnas lugs, gnas tshul) and its way of appearance (Tib. snangs tshul) are to be distinguished. The way in which all beings appear consists of the fact that they have the nature of an illusory appearance, which has come into existence due to the predomi­nating influence of extraneous factors, that is, due to karma and mental poisons. We all are sentient beings. Our way of appearance is to wan­der about in the cycle of existence, driven by the attachment to a self. We perceive as a self what does not exist as a self, as mine what does not exist as mine, and experience manifold suffering under the sway of this perception. The fact that something that does not exist as a self"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 313is perceived as a self, and that something that does not exist as be­longing to this self is perceived as belonging to this self, has the effect that the aspects \"friend\" and \"enemy\" are perceived, that \"my friend\" and \"my enemy\" come into existence. These two aspects of attach­ment and aversion act as the basis giving rise to the manifold forms of suffering. This is the way in which beings appear.The way of appearance of fire, for example, is that it is hot and burning. The way of existence of fire is the fact that it is by nature empty. When one dreams of being burnt by fire, this fire appears as something that is by nature hot and burning. Yet, the true nature or way of existence of this fire is emptiness in the sense that it is free from any conceptual elaboration, or in other words, free from the three aspects of arising, abiding, and ceasing.In the same way, the nature of all beings is the ultimate selflessness of persons and phenomena. The five skandhas do not exist as a self. Nevertheless the two aspects of perception, which contain the beliefs that the person exists as a self and that phenomena exist as a self (Tib. gang zag gi bdag dang chos kyi bdag), arise within us on the basis of these skandhas. When on the basis of the physical body the thoughts \"I\" and \"mine\" arise, these result in a perception taking this body as be­ing a self in the sense that a person truly exists. When these thoughts are not present, but the body is taken to be real and perceived as being truly existent, this is an understanding containing the belief that phe­nomena exist as a self. Yet this body exists neither as a self of the per­son nor of phenomena. Taking the mind for an example, thoughts such as \"my mind is uneasy,\" \"I am unhappy,\" and so forth represent the fault of the belief in the existence of a self of the person. If the mind is viewed as being by nature existent, this is the belief in the existence of a self of phenomena. The mind does not exist as a self. This is the selflessness of persons. The mind is by nature not existent. This is the selflessness of phenomena. This difference should be understood well.The ultimate selflessness of persons and phenomena is non-exist­ence of self as taught by the Prasangika Madhyamaka. Non-existence of self is taught in gradual stages. In the view of the shravakas, for instance, it is to be understood solely as the selflessness of persons, whereas in the view of the Svatantrika Madhyamaka it denotes sheer voidness (Tib. stong kyang) comparable to empty space. In the view of the Prasangika Madhyamaka, non-existence of self is complete peace in the sense of complete freedom from the conceptual elaboration (Tib. spros pa) consisting of the appearance of duality (Tib. gnyis snang). This"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"314 Buddha Natureis the true state or nature of everything (Skt. dharmata, Tib. chos nyid). With regard to the nature of mind, the two aspects \"spaciousness\" or \"expanse\" (Tib. dbyings) and \"primordial wisdom\" (Tib. ye shes) are to be distinguished. Spaciousness is the aspect of emptiness, primordial wisdom that of clear light. The term \"peace\" in the sense of freedom from conceptual elaboration refers mainly to the aspect of emptiness, synonyms of which are the terms \"true state\" (Tib. chos nyid), \"dharma­dhatu\" (Tib. chos kyi dbyings), \"suchness\" (Tib. de bzhin nyid), \"abso­lute truth\" (Tib. don dam pa'i bden pa), and \"thatness\" (Tib. de kho na nyid). In the Mahamudra or Maha Ati systems one speaks of \"the great symbol,\" \"the great gesture,\" or \"the great seal\" (Tib. phyag rgya chen po) and of \"the great perfection\" (Tib. rdzogs pa chen po), respectively.As to peace or freedom from conceptual elaboration (Tib. spros pa zhi ba), two aspects are to be distinguished. The first is the fact that the object, the true state, is beyond conceptualization, and the second is the fact that the understanding realizing this object is free from con­ceptual elaboration.When the object, the true state, is described as being beyond con­ceptualization, this means that emptiness is not equivalent to either non-existence or to sheer voidness that merely refutes this non-exist­ence (Tib. med dgag), nor is it truly existent and so forth. Put briefly, it is a state of complete peace, of freedom from the extreme views hold­ing it to be existent, to be non-existent, both existent and non-existent, or neither existent nor non-existent.Nagarjuna has said in this context:Permanence, impermanence and so on, where are they in this state of peace?Emptiness, non-emptiness and so on, where are they in this state of peace?The state of complete peace beyond permanence and impermanence, emptiness and non-emptiness, is called freedom from conceptual elabo­ration. This is the aspect of the object, or in other words, of emptiness being beyond any conceptualization.The aspect of the understanding, the realizing subject, being free from conceptual elaboration should be understood as follows: When realizing that the object, the true state, is beyond conceptualization, the subject, the realizing understanding, attains the state of freedom from conceptualization while abiding at balance within this realiza­tion. If the object is not free from being conceptualized, accordingly"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"the realizing subject will not attain the state of freedom from concep­tual elaboration. If the object is viewed as being just empty and is realized as such, the realizing subject will reach a state of mere empti­ness, in which nothing whatsoever is present. This understanding still contains an idea, or in other words, a conceptual elaboration. When the object is viewed as clarity, the subject gains a corresponding real­ization and perceives clarity. Similarly, the subject appears as peace, as freedom from thought and conceptual elaboration, when the object is realized as being beyond conceptualization.The fact that the realizing understanding is free from conceptual elaboration means that all thoughts, all perceptions bound up with or tinged by conceptual grasping (Tib. 'zin pa), are completely pacified.In this context some followers of the Mahamudra system are of the opinion that the explanation of the two aspects of freedom from con­ceptual elaboration, as given in the Sutrayana system, means that one absorbs oneself into the object, the true state free from conceptual elabo­ration, and into the subject, the realizing understanding, separately during meditation. This is an error. The proponents of the Sutrayana say on the contrary that one first gains conviction that the object is beyond conceptualization and then absorbs the subject within this free­dom from conceptual elaboration.The system of the Mahamudra teaches that one has to absorb one­self into the nature of mind itself in such a way that one naturally dwells within it just as it appears. Some who receive this teaching without understanding the explanations given in the Sutrayana sys­tem will undergo a second error. The Pandita Atisha said:With regard to the fact that the true state is beyond conceptual elaboration, the realizing understanding is absorbed into a condi­tion of freedom from conceptual elaboration.Some who practice Mahamudra meditation misunderstand this, think­ing that according to the Madhyamaka view one has to absorb the understanding into the true state, into emptiness, which is free from conceptual elaboration. On this basis they believe that the object into which one has to absorb oneself and the understanding that absorbs itself are the same and not two different aspects. They believe this, since according to the Mahamudra system absorption means to natu­rally abide within the nature of mind itself. This is a slight error due to misunderstanding the teachings of the Madhyamaka, according to which one gains conviction that the nature of mind is beyondExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 315"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"316 Buddha Natureconceptualization and then absorbs the realizing understanding into freedom from conceptual elaboration. This error, however, is but a mis­understanding of words. It does not mean that one necessarily errs with regard to one's own true nature as well. From the point of view of one's own realization, realization will arise from naturally abiding within the essence of mind. There are numerous examples of persons who did not know the meaning of absorption as it corresponds to the Madhyamaka view and yet directly realized Mahamudra, the nature of their own mind. This difference should also be understood well.The system of the Madhyamaka contains many different kinds or levels of explanations on the way in which one should meditate ac­cording to this system.It is said, for instance, in the scriptures teaching the gradual stages of meditation on the highest aspect of the knowable (Tib. shes bya'i mchog):Perceived phenomena are empty according to their very own es­sence (Tib. rang rang ngo bos stong). The perceiving mind is also emptiness; it is free from conceptual elaboration. To rest unmoved within the state of freedom from conceptual elaboration, the union of emptiness and clarity, is the main practice of the highest aspect of the knowable.In the context of the gradual stages of meditation on the perfection of discriminative wisdom, the most excellent kind of practice is de­scribed as follows:One gains conviction that all perceived phenomena are empty ac­cording to their very own essence. One gains conviction that the perceiving mind is also empty, free from conceptual elaboration. Then one absorbs oneself into the state of freedom from concep­tual elaboration.Similar statements are to be found in many scriptural passages. It is important that these different kinds of explanation are understood well. Sakya Pandita remarks in this context that there is not the slightest difference between the view of freedom from conceptual elaboration as taught in the system of the Paramita Yana [the vehicle of the six perfec­tions] and the views of the Mahamudra or Mantrayana. One should be aware that if on the level of the Mahamudra or Secret Mantrayana one develops a view that does not include freedom from conceptual elaboration as taught in the Prasangika Madhyamaka system, one holds a view that is flawed with ideas, with conceptual elaboration."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"When speaking of the two types of primordial wisdom, those know­ing correctly and completely, this means the following: The literal meanings of the Tibetan terms here translated as \"correctly\" and \"com­pletely\" are \"as it is\" (Tib. ji lia ba) and \"as much as there is\" (Tib. ji snyed pa). Generally speaking, the term \"correctly\" refers to empti­ness, to the absolute truth, while the term \"completely\" refers to the relative truth. Correct knowledge knows what truly is. If, for example, we dream of a burning fire, what is true about this phenomenon of fire? This fire is without the three aspects of arising, abiding, and ces­sation and as such is empty. What is not true about it? The burning of the fire is not true; it is an illusory appearance and comes about through delusion. The term \"completely\" refers to what is not true or correct, to the aspect of appearance that manifests as a variety.The understanding that perceives what is true or correct is there­fore called \"primordial wisdom that knows correctly,\" and the under­standing that perceives what is not true, the relative aspect of appear­ance, is called \"primordial wisdom that knows completely.\" A buddha possesses these two kinds of primordial wisdom. His correct knowl­edge is the immediate seeing of emptiness. His complete knowledge extends to anything relative.The statement \"they see that the true state has always been present within beings whose state is relative\" should be understood as fol­lows: The literal meanings of the Tibetan terms translated here as \"true state\" and \"those whose state is relative\" are \"nature\" or \"quality\" (Tib. chos nyid) and \"that which has this nature or quality\" (Tib. chos can). In the context of the Uttara Tantra Shastra the first refers to the absolute aspect, to the way a subject matter truly exists, while the lat­ter refers to the relative aspect, to the way a subject matter appears. When one dreams of fire, the state of this fire is relative. Its true state is the fact that it is free from the three aspects of arising, abiding, and ceasing. This is the true nature of fire. When speaking of beings, this refers to whoever possesses a mind (Tib. sems can). What these beings are in truth is the way in which their relative nature or relative state actually exists, this being their true state. The true state of beings is the nature of a perfect buddha, or in other words, the tathagatagarbha, the all-pervading dharmakaya. In the view of the Rangtong Madhya­maka this dharmakaya is solely considered as emptiness in the sense of complete freedom from conceptual elaboration. In the view of the Shantong Madhyamaka it is the inseparable union of emptiness andExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gy am t so Rinpoche 317"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"318 Buddha Natureclear light. In the speech of Dharma this is occasionally also called the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness (Tib. dbyings rig dbyer med). The term \"spaciousness\" refers to the aspect of emptiness or freedom from conceptual elaboration; the term \"awareness\" refers to the aspect of clear light.In the following section of the praise, the two primordial wisdoms constituting the quality of awareness are shown from the viewpoint of being liberated from the veils.Primordial wisdom that knows correctly is freed from attachment to objects—it is free from the veil of the mental poisons. Primordial wisdom that knows completely is freed from obstructions, which is to say, freed from the veil of the hindrances to knowledge. They are called \"obstructions\" since one will not attain the unhindered knowledge of all relative phenomena as long as they are not removed. In order to reach the omniscient primordial wisdom that knows all phenomena, all aspects of the knowable, the veiling net of the hindrances to knowl­edge has to be eliminated.The correctly realizing understanding free from the veil of the men­tal poisons and the completely realizing understanding free from the veil of the hindrances to knowledge are the two aspects of the dis­criminative wisdom beyond the worldly (Tib. 'jig rten las 'das pa'i shes rab). By means of this discriminative wisdom, noble bodhisattvas know the utterly pure dharmadhatu, or way of existence of beings, as being by nature not truly existent. This is the absolute truth, emptiness, the buddha nature. They know furthermore that this dharmadhatu per­vades the limitless number of all sentient beings. Buddha nature is called \"all-pervasive\" since it is present within all beings alike. As far as buddha nature goes, there is no distinction between \"good beings\" who have attained a precious human body and \"inferior beings\" such as animals and so forth. It undifferentiatedly pervades all sentient beings, no matter whether they are happy or suffer, whether they dwell in the higher or lower realms of existence.Since they have these two types of understanding, bodhisattvas possess the completely pure vision of primordial wisdom with regard to the entire range of the knowable. Whatever is able to be an object of understanding is part of the knowable (Tib. shes by a), this being its characteristic. The term \"vision\" of primordial wisdom is here equiva­lent to the discriminative wisdom beyond the worldly. When it is said"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"that this vision is completely pure, this means that it is an authentic seeing that is undistorted, free from error, and complete.In this way the bodhisattvas have the quality of liberation. The ele­ment or the sugatagarbha is present within all beings, yet is not freed from the fetter of the veil of the mental poisons and from the net of the veil of the hindrances to knowledge. When these are removed one has attained the quality of liberation.One may wonder whether someone who has reached the bodhisattva levels is freed from all the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge. This is not the case. At this point the veils are partly purified. This process of purification continues while one travels through the bodhisattva levels, in a degree corresponding to each level. From the point of view that buddha nature in the state of the basis is also completely free from the mental poisons and obstructions to knowledge, and not in the slightest sullied by these, there is utter pu­rity. From the point of view of the gradual removal of the adventitious defilements there is a continuous process of purification. This is ex­pressed in the explanation of the fourth vajra point, where it is said: \"[The element] is pure and yet has affliction. [Enlightenment] was not afflicted and yet is purified.\" An example for this is the fact that ore also contains pure gold, but that a second type of purity, a state of purification, is achieved through the removal of the dross.Annotation 12:The object to be realized is the true state, or in other words, suchness, the way all phenomena actually are. This is emptiness: the nature of mind, the element, or the sugatagarbha. The means necessary to real­ize this object is the primordial wisdom of the noble ones.When the noble ones are said to perceive this object as being present just as it is, this means that they realize the element, or the way in which beings exist, as being the luminous buddha nature, the insepa­rable union of spaciousness and awareness or of emptiness and clear light. This is the object of perception of the primordial wisdom of the noble ones.This object of perception is seen in a way that the noble ones do not have in common with others. This can be illustrated by a general ex­ample: Whenever we have a mental experience, this is an experience we do not have in common with others. Whatever a sentient beingExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 319"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"320 Buddha Natureexperiences is the experience of his or her own mind, which is not shared with anybody else. Corresponding to this example, the noble ones experience or realize the nature of their own minds, just as it is.This realization is a vision by means of inner self-aware primordial wisdom, which is to say that it is not a seeing that focuses outwards. Contrary to that, the tathagatagarbha, the true nature of mind, is called self-aware. On the level of explanation, the object, the true state, and the subject realizing this true state are both to be understood as self-sprung primordial wisdom (Tib. rang byunggi ye shes). During meditation these self-sprung primordial wisdoms are simultaneously realized as peace, as being free from conceptual elaboration. While receiving explanations, one gains the understanding that the object, the true state, as well as the realizing subject, are self-sprung primordial wisdom. During medita­tion, when a condition is reached in which all conceptualization con­taining the duality of subject and object has subsided and come to peace, perception proves to be self-aware. It proves furthermore to be \"seeing itself by itself\" or to be \"self-seeing according to its own essence.\" The two aspects of perception, an object that is seen and a seeing subject, are no longer present. When an ordinary being first hears that \"self- aware\" is equivalent to \"seeing itself by itself,\" this statement is a mere thought, since it is only during meditation that the object, the true state, proves to be self-aware. On this level, the term \"self-aware\" means that the conceptual elaboration that contains subject and ob­ject, a perceived object and a perceiving mind, is completely appeased, that both aspects manifest as self-sprung primordial wisdom, and that one dwells within this condition of self-sprung primordial wisdom wherever it manifests, in its very own place (Tib. rang sar du gnas pa). When the system of the Chittamatra speaks of \"self-aware,\" this means that the consciousness experiences itself by itself. Self-awareness in this context is therefore equivalent to the self-experience of the con­sciousness (Tib. mam shes rang myong).When it is said that the state of beings is relative or, literally speak­ing, that they are those who have a particular state or nature (Tib. chos can), this means that all beings have a true state (Tib. chos nyid), which is the dharmadhatu, the buddha nature, or the tathagatagarbha. This dharmadhatu pervades all beings no matter how many there are, which is to say that it is undifferentiatedly present within all beings, in those of low or high rank, in those who are good or evil alike. Here, the term \"dharmadhatu\" is equivalent to inseparable spaciousness and aware­ness or inseparable spaciousness and primordial wisdom (Tib. dbyings dang ye shes dbyer med pa). This inseparable union of spaciousness and"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 321primordial wisdom is the buddha nature, the tathagatagarbha. In the view presented by the Madhyamakavatara (Tib. dbu ma la 'jug pa) the dharmadhatu is to be understood exclusively as freedom from con­ceptual elaboration. The aspect of primordial wisdom is not explained there. This difference should be understood well.The object of perception of the noble ones is the fact that the dharmadhatu or buddha nature is all-pervasively present within all sentient beings. This means that their perception first focuses on the state or nature of sentient beings and that in this way the true state is perceived. The perception focused on the entirety of beings, on all those who have this state, is the aspect of the primordial wisdom that knows completely.Generally speaking, the aspects of correct and complete knowledge refer to the knowledge of a buddha. In this context the realization of emptiness, the fact that the absolute truth is seen, is called correct knowledge. The realization of each and every aspect that is part of the relative is called complete knowledge. Noble bodhisattvas do not have a realization equaling the correct and complete knowledge of a buddha. Merely the same terms are being used here. Noble bodhisattvas mas­ter correct and complete knowledge to a certain extent, correspond­ing to the level they have reached, yet their realization does not cover all the fields and kinds of the knowable. When a bodhisattva realizes the absolute truth, this is a realization free from the veil that hinders this very realization. What is realized at this point is the fact that the true state of a sentient being is peace. This is the correct knowledge of a bodhisattva. From this knowledge the recognition results that this peace, which is the true state of a sentient being, pervades all, no mat­ter how many there are. This is the complete knowledge of a bodhi­sattva. The realization of a buddha means that he directly sees the nature of all phenomena. This is his correct knowledge. He has com­plete knowledge from the point of view that he sees the entire range of the knowable, all phenomena in all their aspects, in a completely unobscured way. As opposed to that, the passage explained here only refers to a being or to beings respectively. When the nature of one's own mind is realized directly, the power of this realization leads one to see that all sentient beings are the same in that their true state is equally peace; one realizes that the true state that has been realized pervades them all. In other words, there are two objects of realization. The na­ture of one's own mind is realized directly. From this realization a second is deduced. The first object of realization is the true state of beings, which is peace. From this viewpoint there is correct knowledge."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"322 Buddha NatureThe second object of realization is the fact that not a single being is exempted from this true state, that it pervades them all. From this viewpoint there is complete knowledge.When it is stated that bodhisattvas see these objects of realization in a way that they do not have in common with others, this means they have command of a knowledge unequaled by that of an ordinary being, a shravaka, or a pratyekabuddha. In the view presented by the Madhyamakavatara and similar scriptures, the three kinds of noble ones, that is, shravaka arhats, pratyekabuddha arhats, and bodhisattvas who have reached the bhumis, are considered as being on the same level. In this view the noble shravakas and pratyekabuddhas have also real­ized emptiness. Yet, when talking about emptiness in this context, this refers only to the aspect of spaciousness (Tib. dbyings), to freedom from conceptual elaboration. In the context of the Uttara Tantra Shastra the object of realization is buddha nature, the tathagatagarbha, being the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness. This is very diffi­cult to understand. With this understanding bodhisattvas have a real­ization that they do not hold in common with shravaka and pratyeka­buddha arhats. For bodhisattvas who have reached the bodhisattva levels, different names are used. They are also called \"those who have understanding\" (Tib. bio Idem), \"the heirs of the Victorious One\" (Tib. rgxjal sras), or \"shoot of the Victorious One\" (Tib. rgyal ba'i nyu gu). The noble bodhisattvas are more excellent than the shravakas and pratyeka­buddhas since they excel these in understanding.When one speaks of the inner primordial wisdom, this means that noble bodhisattvas realize the nature of their own minds, the sugata­garbha, independently from extraneous conditions, by means of self­sprung primordial wisdom. This realization takes place in such a way that the conceptual elaboration, containing the duality of an object realized and a realizing subject, has come to complete peace. Through the power of inner realization there is correct and complete knowl­edge. Since noble bodhisattvas have directly realized the nature of their own minds, they possess the inner realization. Through the power of this realization they see that the true state of a sentient being is peace. This is correct knowledge. Subsequently they see that this peace pervades all beings without exception. This is complete knowledge. These three aspects are the quality of awareness.Noble bodhisattvas are purified from the two veils of attachment and obstruction, which is to say, from the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge. With regard to both veils, a coarse, a subtler, and an extremely subtle aspect are distinguished. Having"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 323reached the first bodhisattva level, one is purified from the gross as­pects of the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge. The coarse aspect of the veil of the hindrances to knowledge is the belief in true existence. The two subtler aspects, that is, the perception of characteristics and the appearance of duality as such, are to be re­moved gradually while traveling the bodhisattva levels. The quality of being unsurpassable means that noble bodhisattvas are freed from inferior views, from the understanding derived from the lesser ve­hicles. These are the three aspects of the quality of liberation.Annotation 13:The vision of primordial wisdom that knows completely arises from the first bodhisattva level onwards, since at the time when one reaches this level the meaning of the true state is seen directly.Annotation 14:One speaks of the path beyond the worldly or the path of the noble ones, since bodhisattvas who have reached the bodhisattva levels have a realization that is beyond the stage of an ordinary being. They see the dharmadhatu in a way that they do not have in common with others, that is, with ordinary beings, shravakas, and pratyekabuddhas, just as it is, by means of self-aware or self-sprung primordial wisdom. When this dharmadhatu is called \"by nature undefiled,\" this means that the defilements cannot touch the essence of mind at all, that the essence of mind is free from pollution. This undefiled basis is the ele­ment, the buddha nature, or sugatagarbha, which pervades all beings without exception. The fact that bodhisattvas realize this, is called com­plete knowledge.There are two ways of explaining complete knowledge. In the sec­tion commented here it is described as the realization that the dharma­dhatu pervades all knowable things. In this case the dharmadhatu is to be understood as emptiness in the sense of complete freedom from conceptual elaboration, as it is explained in the Rangtong Madhya­maka system. When exclusively viewed as emptiness or as being be­yond conceptual elaboration, the dharmadhatu pervades everything, all sentient beings as well as all things. When viewed in the light of the Shantong Madhyamaka, the dharmadhatu is the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness. This is the nature of mind or the way the mind truly exists. As such it does not pervade outer objects.An ephemeral primordial wisdom is to be understood as a tempo­rary or provisional one, such as that of shravakas and pratyekabuddhas"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"324 Buddha Naturewho only see the selflessness of persons. In comparison with such provisional primordial wisdom, the bodhisattvas' primordial wisdom knowing correctly and completely is of extreme purity. From the view­point of the primordial wisdom of a buddha, however, this is not the case. From this perspective the primordial wisdom of a bodhisattva who has reached the first bodhisattva level is similar to the new moon, whereas the realization of a buddha is like the full moon. A buddha and a bodhisattva are equal as far as the realization of the meaning of the dharmata or the true state is concerned, but there is a great differ­ence in terms of the power or ability of their understanding, in terms of its clarity and expandedness.When it is said that the primordial wisdom of bodhisattvas is free from the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge, this does not mean that a bodhisattva is free from all these veils without any remainder. Utter purification from the veils is not achieved until the level of buddhahood is reached. When a bodhisattva attains the first bodhisattva level he has freed himself from the veils that obstruct the direct realization of the true state, which is to say, he is free from veils during meditation while one-pointedly abiding within the true state itself, seeing the buddha nature. This can be compared to the way in which the sense consciousness of the eye is unobscured and free from veils when it perceives a flower just as it appears. In other words, the primordial wisdom of a bodhisattva is a selective or individual per­ception and understanding. It is not comparable to the primordial wisdom of a buddha, which covers all aspects without exception.This is due to the fact that a bodhisattva who has reached the first bhumi has purified the veils to a certain extent. Taking the veil of the hindrances to knowledge as an example, a coarse, a subtler, and a very subtle aspect are distinguished. The attainment of the bodhisattva levels is equivalent to the moment in which emptiness is seen directly, in such a way that there is not only a passing experience but an imme­diate realization that cannot be lost. This realization takes place when the coarse aspect of the veil of the hindrances to knowledge, that is, the belief in true existence, is abandoned. As long as one holds things to be truly existent, one cannot realize emptiness. Once one has at­tained this realization and thereby the first bodhisattva level, the sub­tler and very subtle aspects of the veil of the hindrances to knowl­edge, which are the perceptional grasping of characteristics and of duality as such, are to be given up gradually while traveling the nine levels above."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 325There are three different explanations as to the way in which the veils are gradually abandoned. Two of these hold that the main part of the veil of the mental poisons and the coarse aspect of the veil of the hindrances to knowledge are abandoned when the bodhisattva levels are reached. According to the third it is only the coarse aspect of the veil of the mental poisons that is eliminated at this point. The subtler aspects of this veil are gradually purified until the seventh bodhisattva level is reached; the purification from the veil of the hindrances to knowledge only starts when the eighth level is attained. This is the explanation of the Gelugpa tradition, when the Prasangika Madhya­maka system is presented. There are further differences according to the Svatantrika Madhyamaka system.Annotation 15:During their last existence those who follow the pratyekabuddha ve­hicle concentrate exclusively on the twelve links of interdependent origination. Relying on this means as their sole support they endeavor to attain the fruit on their own. While traveling the path of training, pratyekabuddhas rely on numerous spiritual friends. Their last exist­ence is the one in which they attain the state of a pratyekabuddha arhat. During this last existence they absorb themselves in their own interdependent origination without the help of a spiritual friend and reflect how this interdependent origination is to be reversed. Through their investigation of interdependence they realize that ignorance gives rise to karmic activity, which in its turn gives rise to birth up to aging and death, that in this way the entirety of samsara comes about. This leads to the understanding that death and old age have ceased when birth is ceased, that birth has ceased when karmic activity is ceased and that karmic activity has ceased when ignorance is ceased. While reflecting on the way in which this dependent origination is gradu­ally reversed, they come to realize what ignorance means. When they are able to see and understand ignorance, they realize that ignorance is by nature not truly existent. They realize the profound meaning of interdependence and thus attain the fruit they have been striving for.Annotation 16:Dharma in terms of teaching comprises all the teachings of the great and lesser vehicles. When speaking of abandoning, two aspects are to be distinguished. These are abandonment by means of an antidote, and a natural process of abandonment taking place through attaining"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"326 Buddha Naturethe ultimate fruit. The veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge are to be abandoned by means of an antidote suitable to each, respectively. As far as the Dharma in terms of teaching is con­cerned, no antidote is needed. It is abandoned in a natural way by attaining the ultimate fruit. Once this fruit is attained, it is no longer necessary to rely on teachings, just as a boat is no longer needed once one has reached the far bank of the river.The two aspects of Dharma in terms of realization are the truth of the path, being the means freeing one from attachment, and the truth of cessation, which constitutes freedom from attachment. The path of training consists of four aspects: the paths of accumulation, junction, seeing, and meditation. The realization of those who travel the path of training is fleeting, since it undergoes a continuous development and progresses from one stage to the next. While following the path of junction, for instance, one meditates on emptiness in such a way that one has a view or an opinion of it. One attributes a certain meaning to emptiness. Once one goes beyond this stage during which emptiness is realized as a complete non-presence of anything and so on, and realizes emptiness directly, the preceding meditation proves to be a changeable phenomenon. During the path of accumulation one medi­tates on suffering and impermanence, and realizes these to be facts. During the path of junction one sees them in the light of emptiness. When emptiness is realized directly, suffering and impermanence do not truly exist. In this way realization changes on the path of training, developing gradually from one stage to the next.The truths of cessation of bodhisattvas who travel the path of train­ing up to the tenth bodhisattva level and of arhats of the lesser ve­hicles are not an ultimate refuge since they do not constitute the ulti­mate quality. In other words, they do not embody the true ultimate fruit, since the ultimate quality is not realized. A refuge that does not embody the ultimate quality is not suited to be an ultimate refuge.To a respective extent, the Sanghas of arhats of the lesser vehicles and of bodhisattvas who have attained the bodhisattva levels have not yet purified the subtle parts of the veils, and are therefore bound up with the fear of these veils. They have not reached the state of utter fearlessness, which is the state of a buddha. Until this is achieved, the members of these Sanghas themselves take refuge in the Buddha. Therefore they are also not an ultimate refuge.In truth, only a buddha who is purified from the two veils and the corresponding remaining imprints, and whose understanding"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 327is expanded to cover the highest object of knowledge, is the ultimate refuge of all sentient beings without exception. When the commen­tary speaks of the completion of freedom from desire and attachment, this refers to freedom from the two veils. Only a buddha is ultimately free from the two veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowl­edge, while arhats and noble bodhisattvas are freed from these veils to a certain extent, corresponding to the respective level they have reached. Only when a member of the Sangha reaches the level of buddhahood has he attained his ultimate fruit, having become a buddha himself.Abuddha is an inexhaustible refuge since he is free from death. He is a permanent refuge since he is free from birth. He is an immutable or unchanging refuge since he is free from aging. He is the absolute or true refuge since he is not fleeting or unsteady, and therefore is unfailing.Annotation 17:In the phase of ordinary beings the dharmadhatu is completely veiled by the net of the mental poisons. In this phase, while not freed from the covering of the mental poisons to even the slightest extent, the dharmadhatu is called \"the element,\" \"the tathagatagarbha,\" or \"the sugatagarbha.\" This is described in the fourth vajra point.Through cultivating the path of the Great Vehicle, this sugatagarbha is completely and utterly freed from all the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge, which are present in the phase of an ordinary being. This is possible since these veils are adventitious, which is to say that they are not defilements by nature and do not truly exist. When, for instance, gold contained in ore is totally freed from the dross surrounding it, the phase in which the gold was contained in ore has changed into another. Nevertheless the nature of this gold has not changed. Due to the fact that the dross was removed, the state of the gold has been completely transformed. On the basis of this transfor­mation the pure gold is obtained.When speaking of the dharmakaya, two aspects are distinguished. These are the dharmakaya that is by nature pure and the dharmakaya that has the two types of purity, which in addition to the first type of purity is also freed from the adventitious defilements. The nature of mind that is within all beings, whether they are good or evil, is the dharmakaya by nature pure. When this primordial dharmakaya is purified from all the adventitious defilements, a second type of purity has joined the first. On the basis of the purity of the nature of mind,"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"328 Buddha Naturewhich is present from the very beginning, the purification from the adventitious defilements has been completed. This results in the fact that two types of purity are present, the first being the primordial pu­rity of the nature and the second being the purification from all obscu­ration. When this second purity in terms of freedom from all defile­ments without exception is achieved, one has reached the state endowed with twofold purity. This is the true dharmakaya. This true or ultimate dharmakaya is suchness, which is free from pollution. This is equiva­lent to enlightenment, which is described in the fifth vajra point.The sixth vajra point describes the buddha qualities. Suchness when freed from any pollution is the dharmakaya possessing the two types of purity. Linked with this dharmakaya are the powers and so on, the qualities of a buddha, consisting of the fruits of freedom and of com­plete maturation.When speaking of a link or connection, two kinds are to be distin­guished. The first is a link in the sense that the same essence or nature is present. The second is a link in the sense of one giving rise to an­other, or in other words, a link in terms of cause and fruit. The first kind of connection means that with regard to the same essence or nature different aspects are present. The link between the buddha qualities and the dharmakaya is to be understood in this light. Considering the connection of fire and smoke, this is a link in terms of cause and fruit, as the first gives rise to the latter. Yet, on the basis of the essence or the nature, there is no connection. The connection of father and son is a link in that one thing has arisen from another—the son has arisen from the father. Between aspects such as compoundedness and imperma­nence there is a link in the sense of having the same essence or nature. A flower, for instance, is compounded by causes and conditions, and it is impermanent, undergoing a progressive process of destruction tak­ing place from instant to instant. When first hearing this, one tends to think that these are different things. Nevertheless the two aspects of compoundedness and impermanence have the same essence or na­ture on the basis of the flower. Of the two types of connection de­scribed here, the link between the dharmakaya and the buddha quali­ties is to be understood in the sense of there being no difference with regard to their essence (Tib. ngo bo la dbye ba med pa'i 'brel ba).The seventh vajra point describes buddha activity. The deeds of a buddha bringing benefit and welfare to sentient beings are called \"ac­tivity.\" With regard to this term two aspects are distinguished: the"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 329activity of the object of action and the activity of the actor. This means that not only the actor possesses his proper power or capacity, but so does the object of action. The capacity of the object of action is to be understood as follows: In all sentient beings buddha nature or the tathagatagarbha is present. This constitutes the capacity enabling sen­tient beings to develop faith in the Three Jewels, compassion for oth­ers, and so on. This is the power, or the activity, of beings who are the object of action. The power of the actor consists of the fact that due to the inherent ability of the buddha qualities there is the capacity to accomplish the benefit of beings. This is the activity of the actor.The last four vajra points, that is, the element or the tathagatagarbha, enlightenment, the qualities, and buddha activity, are the cause and the conditions giving rise to the Three Jewels as their fruit. In this context the tathagatagarbha constitutes the cause. Enlightenment, the qualities, and buddha activity are the necessary conditions. The pri­mary cause for the growth of a flower is the seed. Earth, water, warmth, wind, space, and so on are the necessary conditions. Without these conditions a flower will never grow, although the seed may be present. Only due to the meeting of the cause with the necessary conditions does the growth of the flower take place. The cause for an individual to reach the state of buddhahood is his or her own buddha nature. The necessary conditions are enlightenment, or in other words, the Buddha, his qualities, and his activity.The way the Three Jewels, constituting the fruit, arise from this cause and these three conditions is inconceivable, even to noble shravakas and pratyekabuddhas and to noble ones who have reached the bodhi­sattva levels. Here the term \"inconceivable\" means \"inconceivable by way of direct realization.\" By way of inference or deduction the four vajra points and their link with the Three Jewels are conceivable. It is, for instance, possible to study them or reflect upon them. When speak­ing of realization, two kinds are distinguished. These are inferred valid realization and direct valid realization. As long as one has not real­ized emptiness directly, one has an inferred valid perception of it. This becomes redundant when emptiness is realized directly. Through this direct realization one reaches the first bodhisattva level. The true con­dition of this realization, such as it is, is inconceivable to ordinary be­ings. They can only conceive of it by means of deduction. Noble ones who have reached the bodhisattva levels have direct realization, but not the ultimate one. This is inconceivable to them."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"330 Buddha NatureThe object realized directly, just as it appears, is the true state (Skt. dharmata, Tib. chos nyid). This is equivalent to emptiness, which in this context is to be understood mainly as the buddha nature, the tathagata­garbha. The capacity to perceive this true state arises from the first bodhisattva level onwards. Yet only a buddha possesses the ultimate primordial wisdom directly seeing the true state in everything. This ultimate realization is exclusively the object of perception of buddhas. Shravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats and noble bodhisattvas are ca­pable of direct realization, each to a respective extent. They are not yet capable of ultimate realization. To explain this, Nagarjuna has taken the moon as an example. Arhats of the lesser vehicles and bodhisattvas who have reached the bodhisattva levels see a new moon, while buddhas see the full moon in its utter brightness.Annotation 18:The element is inconceivable to ordinary beings since on one hand the nature or the way of existence of mind has always been completely pure, and yet on the other hand during the impure phase it has the mental poisons, which form on the basis of adventitious defilements. This seems to be a contradiction. It is not, since the defilements are merely adventitious and cannot touch the inherent purity of the na­ture of mind. The fundamental defilement is the veil that comes about through delusion, through mistaking illusory appearance. It is called \"adventitious,\" since on one hand it arises from causes and condi­tions and on the other hand it is able to be removed. Its more active aspect consists of the mental poisons such as desire, hatred, and so on. They are called \"afflictions,\" since they darken and disturb the mind by destroying its peace and torturing it. In a dream, for instance, illu­sory appearances will occur. On the basis of these appearances one develops desire, hatred, and so on. When these mental poisons gain strength and grow, suffering arises. The mental poisons contain the nature of suffering and are therefore an affliction.Enlightenment is inconceivable to ordinary beings since on one hand mind exists in such a way that it is by essence always free from defile­ment, and since on the other hand the purification from the defile­ments has been newly added through the cultivation of the path. This also sounds like a contradiction. It is only a seeming one, as even when the defilements are present, they cannot touch the nature of mind. The nature of mind does not have the slightest fault. Gold contained in ore is also pure gold. In the stage when it is not purified from the surrounding dross it does not have the slightest fault either."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"The buddha qualities are inconceivable, since on one hand during the phase of an ordinary being the tathagatagarbha also exists in the true state, which is completely indivisible, and yet on the other hand it does not become apparent until the state of buddhahood is reached. These statements also seem contradictory. The absolute qualities are the qualities of the dharmakaya. When the true state is said to be com­pletely indivisible, this means that the basis tathagatagarbha, the path tathagatagarbha, and the fruit tathagatagarbha are equally native to it and that it comprises all these aspects. The fact that the power of the qualities does not unfold before buddhahood is reached can also be explained by the example of gold. Even while contained in ore, gold possesses the luster native to pure gold. Yet as long as it is not purified from the surrounding dross, this luster cannot shine forth.Buddha activity is inconceivable to ordinary beings, since on one hand a buddha fulfils the wishes of the disciples in correspondence with their respective capacities and does so spontaneously and with­out deliberate effort, whereas on the other hand he is completely free from thought and ambition. This also seems to be a contradiction. That this is not the case will be shown at a later stage, when buddha activ­ity is explained by means of nine examples in its own chapter.The capacities of the disciples vary depending upon whether they have the shravaka disposition, the pratyekabuddha disposition, or the disposition to the Mahayana. If, for example, one has the shravaka disposition, one is capable of following the Shravakayana and of gain­ing the state of a shravaka arhat as one's fruit, on the basis of the prac­tice of the shravaka teachings. (For the explanation of the term \"dis­position\" see also Part Four, note 2.)When it is stated that a buddha is free from thought when unfold­ing activity, this means the following: The general characteristic of a thought is the fact that an object and a name or term are combined and perceived together as if they were just one thing. This perception is called \"thought\" or \"concept.\" When, for example, a flower is in front of us, the sense consciousness of the eye sees or perceives this object directly, just as it is. When on top of this direct perception the object is given a name and perceived in terms of this name, this is a thought, a conceptual perception. In this context two different things, that is, the object and a term, are linked into just one thing and perceived as such, although the link thus created is completely arbitrary. There is not the slightest need or reason for this particular sense-object to be called \"a flower.\" Nevertheless this name is attached to it in such a way that, merely upon seeing it, it is perceived in those terms.Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 331"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"332 Buddha NatureAnnotation 19:All objects of knowledge are contained within the last four vajra points, which are the element or the tathagatagarbha, enlightenment, quali­ties, and buddha activity. Of these, the tathagatagarbha, or suchness bound up with pollution, is what is to be realized. During the time in which suchness is present in such a way that it is obscured by the defilements, the whole of samsara is contained in this state. Samsara consists of the mental poisons and karma, which give rise to the skandhas, the elements, and the entrances. These mental poisons in their turn are the defilements causing the obscuration of suchness or the tathagatagarbha. For this reason it is said to comprise all objects of knowledge.When this tathagatagarbha is freed from all adventitious stains of delusion without any remainder, these stains having been removed by means of the discriminative wisdom realizing the non-existence of a self, this is enlightenment, the very essence of realization.Linked with enlightenment, in the sense that there is one and the same essence, are the sixty-four qualities of freedom and complete maturation, which are thus the attributes of realization.Realization holds power, which is buddha activity. This means that a buddha has not only attained ultimate realization himself, but causes the other disciples to realize their buddha nature, or sugatagarbha, as well. Thus his activity is the means or method to bring about the real­ization of the other disciples.The tathagatagarbha bound up with pollution, as it is described in the fourth vajra point, is the cause or the basis to be purified. This is because the Three Rare and Sublime Jewels arise when this buddha nature is purified from the obscuration of all the adventitious defile­ments without exception. Once an individual has purified the defile­ments hindering the direct realization of the tathagatagarbha, and thus immediately sees his own buddha nature, he has become a member of the Sangha of noble ones. Due to the power of the direct realization of the sugatagarbha, the mind of a member of the .Noble Sangha is im­mersed in the truth of cessation and the truth of the path. The truth of cessation is freedom from defilements. The truth of the path is the realization freeing one from defilements. These truths are the two as­pects of the sacred Dharma in terms of realization. Once a member of the Noble Sangha has finalized the practice of this Dharma, he has himself turned into a buddha. Therefore the three Rare and Sublime Jewels arise from the fact that the buddha nature is purified from all pollution without any remainder."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"The remaining three vajra points, that is, enlightenment, the quali­ties, and the activity of buddhahood, are the conditions bringing about the purification from the adventitious defilements. This is comparable to the way in which gold is freed from the surrounding dross. The action of removing the dross is the necessary condition to obtain the pure gold.Annotation 20:The fact that the dharmakaya is all-embracing can be compared to the way in which light diffuses and embraces everything within its reach. The dharmakaya pervades all phenomena as, for example, butter per­vades milk, in the sense that all milk can be turned into butter.Samsara is equivalent to conditioned existence, the nature of which is suffering. When going beyond the suffering of samsara one has reached the state of nirvana. Samsara and nirvana are the same in that with regard to their true state or suchness, there is not the slightest differentiation. There are not two different types of suchness, one of samsara and another of nirvana. The dharmadhatu, or emptiness, is by nature utterly pure. It never suffers the slightest impairment through the veils obscuring it until buddhahood is reached. These veils in their turn are able to be removed. When gold, for example, is contained in ore, the gold itself is completely pure. Its essence is not touched by the surrounding dross. The dross in its turn constitutes a defilement that is removable up to the point where not the slightest trace is left. The nature of beings is called the disposition of the Tathagata or the dispo­sition to buddhahood (Tib. sangs rgyas kyi rigs), since it holds the power or ability to become a real buddha who possesses the two types of purity. This is comparable to the way in which the seed will inevitably become a flower once it meets with the necessary conditions.The quotation from Lodán Sherab points out that the three reasons why the tathagatagarbha can be said to be present within all sentient beings refer to three different aspects, these being the fruit, the nature, and the cause. According to his view the first reason refers to the dharmakaya being the real Tathagata. The nature of beings is not the Tathagata. It is merely named after it. The difference between the real subject itself and a subject that is named after it is to be understood as follows. Taking the term \"lion\" as an example, this can be used as the name of the real subject itself and as a name attached to another sub­ject respectively. When the animal himself is called \"lion,\" this is the real name. When an individual who has great strength and power is called \"lion,\" this is an attached or imputed name given for the reasonExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 333"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"334 Buddha Naturethat this individual wields great power as does a lion. Similar to this example, beings do not have the dharmakaya possessing the two types of purity, that is, the inherent purity of the nature and the additional purity that has come about through the total purification from all the veils. Yet beings are able to attain this dharmakaya, which is the real Buddha or Tathagata. Therefore the dharmakaya is explained as be­ing all-pervasive. In the view presented by Lodán Sherab, the dharma­kaya is to be understood as that which has the two types of purity, whereas suchness is equivalent to emptiness. This suchness is the na­ture of both a buddha and beings because, when considered from the aspect of the utter purity of the nature, the tathagatagarbha is present without any differentiation within a buddha and beings alike.According to this view, the disposition to buddhahood is the real nature of beings. Being the cause of the Buddha, or Tathagata, it has been given the name of the fruit.In short, according to Lodán Sherab, the nature of a buddha is the dharmakaya, the nature of beings is the disposition to buddhahood, and suchness, which is equivalent to emptiness, is the nature of both a buddha and beings, pervading them undifferentiatedly.In the quote from the words of the Buddha [\"since buddha wisdom is always present within the assembly of beings...\"] it is the primor­dial wisdom of a buddha that pervades all beings. \"The undefiled nature\" refers to the dharmakaya, and \"freedom from duality\" refers to suchness or the true state. In this context, Jamgôn Kongtrül the Great clarifies that the above words of the Buddha, which are contained in the version of the root text he comments, neither appear in all the translations of the root text nor in every commentary, especially not in those of his time. Yet he points out that these words have been quoted, explained, and commented by many eminent scholars. Golo was a great translator; Karma Konchôn and Rongton were both great schol­ars. The latter belonged to the Sakya school. The Jonangpas, that is, Dolpopa, Taranatha and others, were the first to establish the Shantong view. Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, also known as Kiinchen Dolpo Sangjà, is especially famous and revered for his giving the practice of the Kalachakra Tantra, which belongs to the Vajrayana system.

When the sky is obscured by clouds, these clouds have arisen as something fleeting: they are but an adven­titious obscuration that does not touch the nature of the sky itself. The sky is by nature completely pure. When water is mixed with mud and the like, this does not affect the purity of the water. The water itself is by nature completely pure and has never been defiled in any way. These three are examples for the fact that the tathagatagarbha or the dharmadhatu is by nature utterly pure and never touched by the slight­est defilement. Here the dharmadhatu is to be understood as being equivalent to the way the mind truly exists, which is the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness or of emptiness and clear light. When viewed in the light of the Rangtong Madhyamaka, the dharmadhatu is nothing but emptiness in the sense of freedom from conceptual elaboration, whereas in the Shantong and Mahamudra views it is spaciousness-awareness inseparable. On the basis of sheer emptiness it could not become the cause for the attainment of buddhahood. The fact 'that the dharmadhatu is the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness or of emptiness and clear light consti­tutes the reason why the fruit, the level of buddhahood, can be reached. Thus the power allowing the arising of the primordial wisdom and the kayas of a buddha is present. For this reason the view of the dharmadhatu being the inseparable union of spaciousness and aware­ness plays a very prominent part in the Shantong Madhyamaka and Mahamudra traditions.When it is said that the dharmadhatu is by nature always free from the stains of the mental poisons, this explains the way in which the essence is by nature utterly pure and at no time affected by the slight­est fault, though adventitious defilements are temporarily present, until the state of buddhahood is reached. This is expressed above (B.II.2.2. 1.3) where the fourth vajra point is described as being inconceivable, by stating: \"[The element] is pure and yet has affliction.\" Even while it is present the pollution of the veils cannot touch its essence. The essence itself has been utterly pure since beginningless time. The way it is pure is to be understood by means of the three examples of a"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"336 Buddha Natureprecious jewel, the sky, and water. The essence of a jewel itself is free from any defilement, the essence of water itself is free from mud, and the essence of the sky itself is free from clouds. Thus they are by na­ture completely pure.It is very important to understand that there is not the slightest pol­lution as far as the essence is concerned, that defilements, though present, cannot touch the essence. In the light of this view, the Maha­mudra and Maha Ati traditions speak of \"freedom from bondage and liberation.\" On the basis of this complete purity of the essence, the view of \"purity and equality\" is introduced on the level of the secret Mantrayana. The reason why one can speak of the purity and equality of all phenomena is the fact that no stain has ever impaired their es­sence, that this essence has been completely pure since beginningless time, as it is taught in the Uttara Tantra Shastra. Once this fact is under­stood well, one will be able to understand the view of purity and equal­ity or of \"utter purity\" (Tib. dag pa rab 'byams) as taught in the system of the secret Mantrayana. In order to gain the understanding that the essence is completely pure, one should reflect on the process of dream­ing: No matter how many impure appearances arise during dream, this impurity does not have the slightest substance in the sphere of the mind; the impure things do not really exist in any way. When re­flecting in this way, first understanding, then certainty, and finally firm conviction, will arise. As long as individuals like us do not thoroughly reflect by means of suitable examples, as for instance dreaming, ap­pearances are viewed as being different in that there is the duality of pure and impure appearances. There is perception of a multitude of pure and impure things, of a beautiful flower, revulsive filth, and so on. This is not worthwhile to reflect upon. Such perception is present in the phase in which understanding is polluted by the belief in true existence and all appearances are perceived in the light of this under­standing. From the viewpoint of correct valid cognition this phase can be illustrated by means of the example of drunkenness. It is a state marked by confusion and delusion, this delusion being due to the pre­dominating influence of the belief in true existence. When reflecting upon the dream appearances, one will understand that their essence is pure. Once one has gained a firm conviction of the complete purity of the essence, one is able to develop an equal conviction of the teach­ings of the Vajrayana. On this basis one will find it easy to practice these teachings, whereas not understanding the purity of the essence one will have difficulties in gaining conviction of the Vajrayana level"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"of teachings and will develop doubts with regard to the view of utter purity as presented there.(2) Although the essence is by nature completely pure like the sky and so on, and thus free from bondage and liberation, there are ad­ventitious defilements that have to be removed. The method by which these adventitious defilements are purified is the cause of the accom­plishment of the fruit. This cause is fourfold.The first cause is devotion towards the Mahayana Dharma. This is because in the view of the Mahayana, the basis to be purified is the element, the sugatagarbha. On this basis the defilements to be removed are ultimately purified up to their very end. Contrary to this, in the view of the shravakas, for instance, the basis to be purified is not the sugatagarbha. Accordingly, the followers of this vehicle do not rely on the ultimate means to purify the adventitious stains. Since the teach­ings of the Mahayana are the only ones to provide the means to purify all defilements preventing the direct manifestation of the sugatagarbha, devotion towards the Mahayana Dharma is needed as the unsurpass­able means of purification.The second purifying cause is highest discriminative wisdom, which realizes the non-existence of a self. There are many other kinds of dis­criminative wisdom among worldly beings. Higher than these is the discriminative wisdom realizing the non-existence of a self. This wis­dom arises on the basis of the sacred Dharma. The highest discrimina­tive wisdom is the one not only realizing the selflessness of persons, but realizing the selflessness of both persons and phenomena. This arises on the basis of the Mahayana Dharma.The third purifying cause is limitless samadhi endowed with bliss, or in other words, having the nature of bliss.The fourth purifying cause is great compassion focusing on beings as its object or point of reference. It utters itself in the wish: \"If only all sentient beings were free from their suffering up to its very end!\" There are three types of compassion, as they are described for instance in the Madhyamakavatara (Tib. dbu ma la 'jug pa). The first is compassion fo­cusing on beings as its object. The second is compassion focusing on the [impermanent] nature of beings and things, and the third is com­passion free from any focus. This last-mentioned type of compassion is what mainly needs to be given rise to, once one has realized empti­ness. This is stated in many passages, as for example in the Supplica­tion for the Realization of Mahamudra (Tib. phyag chen srnon lam) by the Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje, where it is said:Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 337"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"338 Buddha NatureThe nature of beings is always buddha. Yet, not realizing this they wander through the endless cycle of existence. For all beings in their boundless suffering, may unbearable compassion be bom in our streams of being.Even as the skillful activity of unbearable compassion unfolds without hindrance, may at the same time the meaning of its empty essence nakedly shine forth. Inseparable from this supreme un­erring path of union may we meditate at all times, day and night.These three types of compassion will arise gradually. As a begin­ner, one first has to give rise to compassion focusing on beings as its object. Once one realizes the impermanent nature of beings and phe­nomena, understanding that all compounded phenomena are imper­manent in that they undergo a process of destruction taking place from instant to instant, compassion focusing on the nature arises. Finally, the realization of the emptiness of all phenomena gives rise to com­passion free from any focus. As far as the purification of the defile­ments is concerned, this last-mentioned type of compassion is the most efficient means. Until compassion free from any focus has arisen, com­passion towards sentient beings is still flawed by attachment in terms of the belief in their true existence. Once one realizes that beings do not truly exist and yet feels compassion for them, this is the most ex­cellent type of compassion.The realization resulting from these four purifying causes is enlight­enment. This is the fruit achieved once the adventitious defilements are completely purified, as described in the fifth vajra point.Annotation 22:Of the three types of individuals mentioned in the commentary, those who desire existence are beings who have the cut-off disposition and beings who have great desire and are completely immersed in the cycle of existence. Those who desire freedom from existence are tirthikas, shravakas, and pratyekabuddhas. Those who desire neither existence nor freedom from existence are not specifically mentioned in the com­mentary. This refers to bodhisattvas who abide in neither of the ex­tremes of cyclic existence or of the individual peace that is the fruit of the small vehicles. The term \"tirthika\" (Tib. mu stegs pa) is here used as a general name and refers to the proponents of the various non- Buddhist tenet systems. The Tibetan term mu stegs pa is sometimes translated as \"heretic,\" which has a strongly negative connotation. Jamgôn Kongtrül the Great, who holds an unbiased view, has clari­fied in his Treasury of Knowledge (Tib. shes bya kun khyab) that it refers to"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"proponents of tenets who have not quite entered the path to liberation and whose conduct is not altogether conducive to this aim, but who are very near to it and will eventually reach it. The term mu literally means \"edge\" or \"boundary\" and the term stegs means \"support\" or \"platform.\" Based on these literal meanings, Jamgon Kongtriil the Great points out that mu refers to the view and stegs refers to the con­duct. Thus he explains that the term mu stegs pa denotes individuals whose view is not altogether in correspondence with the truth but is at the very edge of a correct view, and whose conduct is not quite the right support but also very near to proper conduct.Annotation 23:Discriminative wisdom realizing the way everything exists is equiva­lent to discriminative wisdom realizing the non-existence of a self, or in other words, emptiness.There are many different kinds of samadhi, many hundreds of thou­sands, such as the samadhi of earth, of water, of fire, of red, yellow, and so on. Whatever object of perception one focuses upon during meditation will eventually result in an according samadhi. The medi­tation on many different objects serves as a means to strengthen one's power of concentration and one's mental capacity. When gaining mas­tery over samadhi, any object one meditates on becomes limitless and one is able to actually transform oneself into this object. When practic­ing, for instance, the samadhi of water, one meditates upon every­thing as being of the nature of water, until it directly manifests in the appearance of water. When Jetsiin Milarepa had gained mastery over this particular samadhi, he was able to transform his physical form into water and was seen by others as a pond into which they threw pebbles. The term \"treasury of space\" refers to the fact that when true samadhi is developed and mastered, one has the power to prevent the exhaustion of any material goods that other beings need to dispel their poverty. Accounts of this capacity are to be found in the life stories of many eminent lamas and realized beings, as it is, for example, de­scribed in the Bible that Jesus was able to feed a great multitude with just five loaves of bread and two fish.The terms \"samadhi\" and \"meditative stability\" (Tib. bsam gtan) are being used synonymously here. They refer to a state in which the mind rests one-pointedly, in peace. The literal meaning of the word bsam is \"reflection\" and the meaning of gtan is \"stable.\" Thus bsam gtan is defined as the mind abiding stably focused on a wholesome object.Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 339"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"340 Buddha NatureAnnotation 24:\"The absolute expanse\" is equivalent to the .element or the sugata­garbha. It has two particular features in that it can be considered in terms of fruit and function. The fruit consists of four perfect qualities: \"True purity\" refers to the fact that buddha nature in terms of the fruit is beyond the extremes of purity and impurity. \"True self\" refers to the fact that all conceptual elaborations in terms of the existence of a self and the non-existence of a self have been completely stilled and come to peace. \"True happiness\" denotes the fact that it is beyond the extremes of happiness and suffering, and \"true permanence\" stands for the fact that all conceptual elaboration in terms of permanence and impermanence is completely pacified.The fact that the sugatagarbha is present within all sentient beings is not without effect. Buddha nature has a function inducing weari­ness of the suffering of samsara, a longing for nirvana, which is peace in that it is free from this suffering, and finally devotion towards this aim. The Tibetan equivalent for the Sanskrit term \"nirvana\" is mya ngan las 'das pa. The term mya ngan means \"misery\" or \"affliction\" and the term las 'das pa means \"beyond.\" Thus \"nirvana\" is a state free from or beyond any torment and pain.Annotation 25:The fruit is achieved through applying the four causes, that is, devo­tion, discriminative wisdom, meditative stability, and compassion, and thus purifying the adventitious defilements. This fruit has four as­pects. These are true purity, true self, true happiness, and true perma­nence. The dharmakaya has always been utterly pure. Nevertheless the children entertain four wrong beliefs with regard to this dharma­kaya, or in other words, with regard to the nature of all phenomena. The term \"child\" (Tib. byis pa) is used in two different ways. On one hand it is used for someone who is very young of age as opposed to an older person, and on the other hand it is used for someone who is very ignorant and foolish as opposed to someone who is capable and skilled in both learning and practice. Here the term \"child\" is to be understood in the latter meaning. It stands for a deeply ignorant per­son who does not understand the nature of phenomena at all. When an image appears in a mirror such a person will think that it is real and hold it to be truly existent. A child in that sense is deluded in that he or she takes things that do not truly exist as being truly existent and thus turns reality upside down. This delusion consists of four wrong perceptions: Impure things are mistakenly perceived as being"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 341pure. Suffering is mistakenly perceived as happiness. What does not exist as a self is mistakenly perceived as an existing self to which one is strongly attached. Finally, that which is impermanent is mistakenly perceived and clung to as being permanent.When following the Shravakayana one applies four antidotes to counteract these four wrong beliefs. To remedy the perception of some­thing impure as being pure, one meditates on the fact that one's own body and others' bodies are impure. As a remedy for the wrong con­cept consisting of the attachment to a truly existing self, one meditates on the non-existence of a self. To remedy the attachment that takes suffering to be happiness, one meditates on the fact that the entirety of samsara is of the nature of suffering. As a remedy for the percep­tion of permanence, one meditates on impermanence. Thus according to the shravaka tradition the four remedies for the four wrong con­cepts of the children are the meditations on impurity, non-existence of self, suffering, and impermanence.Yet, in the light of the ultimate nature of phenomena these four rem­edies of the shravaka tradition imply a fault as well. Though through the recognition of impurity, non-existence of a self, suffering, and im­permanence one achieves the reversal of the four wrong concepts held by the children, these recognitions do not correspond to the ultimate nature of phenomena and thus represent in their turn wrong concepts of a subtler kind. If, for instance, while dreaming one sees the attrac­tive physical appearance of a man or woman and develops attach­ment, viewing this body as being pure, this belief is wrong. If one reflects upon it as being impure and meditates accordingly, so that finally it actually appears as an impure phenomenon, this is a wrong vision as well. The dream appearances of one's own and others' bod­ies, no matter how they may be, are beyond the extremes of both pu­rity and impurity. They represent a state of peace in terms of freedom from any conceptual elaboration. They are spacious and relaxed, move­ments of clear light, which is the mind itself. They are in the state of emptiness, beyond purity and dirt. This emptiness is not an empti­ness in terms of \"non-existent,\" as is a rabbit horn, nor is it nothing at all like sky. It is a state of utter peace, of complete freedom from any conceptual elaboration. This is experienced as relaxation and spacious­ness within clear light, which is the nature of the mind itself.While one applies the methods of the Shravakayana and reverses the four beliefs of the worldly beings by means of the four antidotes taught in this system, one will develop an attachment to these remedies. When, for instance, following the shravaka tradition one meditates upon the"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"342 Buddha Natureimpurity of one's own body and that of others, one will gradually develop the actual consciousness realizing them as being impure and dirty. Once this consciousness has arisen, in consequence there will be attachment to this concept of impurity. At that stage one has to prac­tice meditation until this attachment does not arise at all any more. In the tradition of the Mahayana the four aspects of the true purity of the dharmakaya and so on act as the remedies for the four kinds of at­tachment that form by applying the four methods of the Shravakayana.While worldly beings perceive the body as being pure, shravakas counteract this perception through the meditation on impurity. The fruit is beyond both these extremes. It is beyond purity and impurity and thus constitutes the perfection of true purity.Worldly beings take what does not exist as a self for an existing self and are attached to this self. In the shravaka tradition one counteracts this belief in an existing self through meditating on the non-existence of a self, yet only in terms of sheer voidness. These concepts, and mainly the latter one, are purified by the understanding that the fruit is a state of peace, of complete freedom from the conceptual elaboration of an existing self or of the non-existence of a self. Thus it is the perfec­tion of true self.Worldly beings are attached to happiness and mistake suffering for happiness. Shravakas counteract this belief by means of the under­standing that all feelings of ordinary happiness are in fact suffering. Thus they meditate on the entirety of samsara as being of the nature of suffering. In the tradition of the Mahayana one gains the under­standing that the fruit is beyond any extreme, that it is beyond both happiness and suffering and as such free from all conceptual elabora­tion. Thus it is the perfection of true happiness.Worldly beings take what is impermanent as being permanent and are attached to permanence. In the shravaka tradition one recognizes and contemplates the fact that whatever appears to be permanent undergoes a process of destruction taking place from instant to in­stant and thus is of an impermanent nature. In doing so one develops attachment holding the very subtle aspect of impermanence to be real or truly existent. In order to reverse this attachment one has to medi­tate as taught in the Mahayana tradition. One has to understand that while permanence does not exist, impermanence, which is merely its contrary or opposite, cannot exist either. Light cannot exist without darkness and darkness cannot exist without light. If there is no light in this world, darkness will not appear. If there is no darkness, there"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"will be no light. The same is true of hearing and sound. Without sound there is no hearing. Without hearing there is no sound. These can only exist together in that they mutually presuppose each other. One has to understand that the fruit is beyond this mutual implication, being beyond permanence and impermanence and thus constituting the per­fection of true permanence.In short, in the state of children the dharmakaya is obscured by four wrong beliefs. Once these have been reversed by means of the four antidotes as taught in the shravaka tradition, four kinds of at­tachment have formed, which in their turn obscure the true state of the dharmakaya. The obscuration caused by the four antidotes of the shravaka tradition has to be removed subsequently by the understand­ing that the dharmakaya is true purity, true self, true happiness, and true permanence. The means leading to the perfection of these four qualities are the four causes mentioned above, which are outstanding devotion, highest discriminative wisdom, meditative stability, and compassion.Annotation 26:The term \"perfection of true self\" is to be understood as follows: The tirthikas, such as different Hindu traditions and so on, hold the belief of there being a self or atman that is eternal (Tib. rtag pa), unique (Tib. gcig), and independent (Tib. rang dbang). This self or atman is called \"true self.\" The shravakas and so on remedy this belief by the medita­tion on the non-existence of a self. They meditate that everything does not exist as a self at all, that everything is nothing but sheer voidness. The belief in the existence of an eternal, unique, and independent self is a wrong concept and perception. While the recognition that every­thing is utterly non-existent constitutes a valid remedy for this wrong perception of the tirthikas, it is in its turn also distorted in that it does not correspond to the ultimate nature of everything either. The ulti­mate nature of everything is a state of peace completely beyond the conceptual elaboration in terms of the existence of a self or the non­existence of a self. If, for instance, while dreaming one thinks in terms of \"self\" and \"I,\" attachment to one's body will arise born from the belief in an existing self. This is a mistaken reaction based on a de­luded concept. If, while dreaming, one thinks that a self does not exist at all and therefore takes this body to be nothing but empty, this is also a deluded thought. In truth it is beyond any of these conceptual elaborations. There is a great difference between \"true self\" as taughtExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 343"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"344 Buddha Naturein the Hindu traditions and as taught in the Mahayana system. In the first sense the term \"true self\" denotes a self that is eternal, unique, and independent. \"True self\" as taught in the Uttara Tantra Shastra is equivalent to the state of peace in terms of complete freedom from any conceptual elaboration. This state of peace has only been given the name of \"true self.\" There is a mere similarity in terms. The Mahayana system does not hold the view of an eternal, unique, and independent self. Between light and darkness, for instance, there is only a similarity inasmuch as they are both things (Skt. bhdva, Tib. dngos po) fulfilling a function. Apart from that they contradict each other; there is not the slightest similarity.Arhats who have reached the fruit of the lesser vehicles still have subtle skandhas, or in other words, a body of mental nature. These skandhas are due to the fact that arhats still have an undefiled type of karma resulting from the mental poisons, which consist of the remain­ing imprints of ignorance. When the state of an arhat is reached, igno­rance itself is eliminated. Nevertheless the remaining influence of ig­norance, which constitutes a very subtle obscuration, is still present and needs to be abandoned. When these subtle remaining imprints of ignorance are called \"mental poisons,\" this is merely an imputed name. Arhats have ceased all mental poisons, and the remaining imprints of ignorance are in fact a subtler part of the veil of the hindrances to knowledge.When Dolpopa states that the absolute expanse is spontaneously present, this refers to the fact that the qualities of buddhahood have been spontaneously present since beginningless time. In the Shantong tradition the faults are viewed as being adventitious and the qualities are viewed as being spontaneously present, whereas in the Rangtong tradition the faults are also held to be adventitious, while the qualities are to be newly attained.Annotation 27:The literal meaning of the Sanskrit term \"skandha\" (Tib. phung po) is \"heap.\" [This term arose from the fact that, when the Buddha explained the skandhas, he heaped up various grains into five piles to represent the categories of impermanent phenomena.] The five skandhas repre­sent all impermanent phenomena, those of the personal continuum as well as those of the external world.Those who are dominated by great desire are beings who are at­tached to and crave for the happiness of existence. They believe that"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"the five skandhas are an existing self or entity and perceive them ac­cordingly. Thus they fall into the extreme of existence. The only means to cut this belief in the existence of a self and the wrong perception resulting from it is the discriminative wisdom realizing that neither a self of the person nor of phenomena exist. As long as this wisdom is not present, one cannot cut the attachment to a self.One speaks of \"dormant tendencies\" (Tib. bag la nyal) as opposed to something that directly manifests. At the time, for example, when strong faith or great love arises, feelings of anger and the like are po­tentially present in a dormant state. When one gets angry, this changes into a direct manifestation.Shravakas and pratyekabuddhas are mainly concerned about their own suffering and therefore strive to free themselves from this suffer­ing and to attain a state of peace for themselves. Thus they fall into the extreme of mere individual peace. The means to remedy this limited motivation is great compassion uttering itself in the wish that all sen­tient beings without exception may be free from all their suffering.When thoroughly cultivating these two means, one does not abide in any extreme. Discriminative wisdom realizing emptiness prevents one from abiding in the extreme of existence. Inspired by great com­passion, one will not strive to attain a state of mere peace. Thus one will eventually reach the non-abiding nirvana, which is the ultimate fruit.Annotation 28:The fact that an individual is able to feel weary of the suffering of samsara and to develop longing for the attainment of the state of lib­eration is considered as being due to the presence of the disposition to buddhahood. Without this disposition these feelings would not arise. This refers to the fact that the mind is not just the power of this body of flesh and blood, but constitutes a particular force.Generally speaking, any human being, although he has not devel­oped love as taught in the Dharma, is able to feel love and compas­sion for another. Furthermore, the mind will undergo changes and manifest a great number of different expressions. At one time one gives rise to love, at another time it does not arise. Even towards a friend whom one loves, one may suddenly get angry. At that time love is no longer present. These changes could not take place if the mind was simply the power of this body of flesh and blood. If that was the case, whatever had arisen would be there to stay. Once love had arisen, anger could not arise. Once anger had arisen, love could not arise.Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 345"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"346 Buddha NatureThe fact that the mind undergoes these changes is the sign that the mind constitutes a particular power, which is not the power of this body but comes from previous lives. The body depends on this par­ticular power. When a person is mentally unhappy, his body is not able to be happy. It does not have an independent force of its own.As long as the disposition to buddhahood is not awakened, an un­derstanding of what is to be adopted and what is to be rejected will not arise. The awakening of the disposition can be illustrated by the following example: while a pig likes to dwell in mud and filth and cares little about a flower garden, a human being finds filth revulsive and delights in a beautiful garden. Once this pig has been reborn as a human being its attitude will have changed. It will no longer delight in filth and mud, but prefer the flower garden.Annotation 29:Whereas according to the Rangtong view the qualities in terms of the fruit are something that is developed and newly attained, the Shantong view holds that the qualities in terms of the cause and the qualities in terms of the fruit are equally inherent to the element or the buddha nature. According to this view the three aspects of the tathagatagarbha in terms of basis, path, and fruit are only distinguished from the view­point of the purification from the adventitious stains of delusion. The buddha nature itself does not change, and the qualities that become apparent, once all the adventitious stains have been completely re­moved, are inseparable from it and have always been present. This can be understood by means of the example of muddy water. It con­tains the qualities in terms of the cause as well as those in terms of the fruit. Water containing mud of itself has the power to become clear, in that the mud will settle by itself once the water rests unmoved. These are the qualities in terms of the cause. While water is muddy, it will not show a clear reflection of the moon, whereas once the mud has settled by itself and the water has become clear, the reflection of the moon will appear extremely clearly. These are the qualities in terms of the fruit. Both types of quality are equally inherent to the water, even while it is muddy.The qualities in terms of the cause are devotion towards the Mahayana Dharma, discriminative wisdom, samadhi, and compas­sion. They are called causes since they bring about the removal of the adventitious stains.

They all have one and the same basis, or essence, which in itself is completely indivisible. This essence is the buddha nature.Annotation 30:The seven properties of no-more-leaming, that is, the first five kinds of clairvoyance, unpolluted primordial wisdom, and abandonment free from defilement, correspond to the level of a buddha.Annotation 31:The topic \"manifestation\" refers to the fact that with regard to suchness three phases are to be discerned. The first phase is that of an ordinary being who has not directly realized the meaning of emptiness. The second phase is that of a noble bodhisattva who has directly realized the nature of the mind, or truth. The third phase is that of a perfect buddha who has eliminated the two veils along with all their remain­ing imprints without any exception, who has perfected the two as­pects of abandonment and realization. These three phases are called the suchness of an ordinary being, the suchness of a noble one, and the suchness of a perfect buddha. In this context it is important to understand that these three \"types of suchness\" are just three differ­ent aspects in terms of its manifestation in three different phases. As far as the essence is concerned there is not the slightest differentiation. Suchness itself is indivisible.\"The Omniscient One who Directly Sees Thatness\" is an epithet of the Buddha. A buddha is called \"omniscient\" since he possesses the unhindered knowledge of all aspects of the knowable. The direct vi­sion of thatness (Tib. de kho na nyid) is synonymous with the vision of reality as it is, with the direct realization of emptiness, of the absolute truth, of the dharmadhatu or the sugatagarbha.A being is called \"fortunate\" (Tib. skal pa dang Idan pa) when he has the karmic fortune or gift enabling him to practice the Dharma. The term \"fortune\" (Tib. skal pa) is equivalent to the frame of mind and the ability of a person. If, for instance, one wants to practice the teachings of the secret Mantrayana, one needs the respective karmic fortune orExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 347"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"348 Buddha Naturegift that consists of faith and pure vision. Without these one can study those teachings but will not be able to put them into practice.\"The Victorious One\" is another epithet of the Buddha. The com­mon explanation why this term is used is the fact that a buddha has been victorious through overcoming the four maras or demons (Tib. bdud). (See also Part Four, note three.)Annotation 32:Through the topic \"manifestation\" the following is explained: Al­though in terms of the essence, suchness cannot be divided, there is a division into three different kinds due to the different individuals who are its basis. Therefore the classification presented is only a classifica­tion by means of the basis. As to space itself, for instance, there are no different kinds, nevertheless there is an eastern, a western, a south­ern, and a northern space, when space is viewed from the basis of the earth. Likewise, there is an inner and an outer space on the basis of a house and so on. Without such bases space cannot be divided at all. Corresponding to this example, the dharmadhatu is classified into three kinds, that is, into the unpurified suchness, the partly purified and partly unpurified suchness, and the completely purified suchness, on the basis of three respective types of individuals.When it is said that suchness manifests in the phase of a buddha in an unperverted way and as freedom from any conceptual elabora­tion, this refers to the following: In this phase the ordinary concept- bound mind (Tib. sems) is no longer present, but has been replaced by primordial wisdom (Tib. ye shes). The ordinary mind is characterized by the fact that there is the appearance of duality through the percep­tion of an outer object by a perceiving inner subject or consciousness. In the phase of a buddha, the mind is equivalent to primordial wisdom. Thus it is unperverted, which is to say that it is free from any delu­sion. The different ways in which understanding will manifest can be shown by the example of dreaming: The understanding present while one recognizes that one is dreaming, and the understanding present while one does not recognize the dream for what it is, are not the same. There are two different ways of manifestation.The terms \"conceptual elaboration\" (Tib. spros pa) and \"freedom from conceptual elaboration\" (Tib. spros med) are to be understood as follows: All thoughts (Tib. rtogpa) are conceptual elaborations. These elaborations are of two kinds: those of the perceiving subject and those"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"of the object perceived. The thoughts that constitute the perceiving subject are conceptual elaborations. By means of these thoughts the conceptualization of the perceived object will come about. When, for instance, while dreaming one thinks \"this is fire,\" \"this is water,\" etc., or \"this is pure,\" \"this is dirty,\" and so on, these thoughts are concep­tual elaborations of the perceiving subject. Accordingly there are \"wa­ter,\" \"fire,\" \"friend,\" \"enemy,\" etc., a multitude of conceptualized out­ward appearances. Once the conceptual elaboration of the perceiving subject has arisen, the elaboration of the object will arise in the same measure. There is an interdependent origination in terms of the initial thought forming the support and the perceived object being supported by this thought. This is best understood by the example of dream. To body and speech themselves, thoughts do not arise, yet with regard to body and speech, perceiving thoughts will occur. All thoughts arise either on the basis of body or speech. Thoughts such as \"my body,\" \"my head,\" \"my legs,\" \"my hands,\" and so on arise on the basis of the body. Thoughts such as \"this is good,\" \"this is bad,\" \"this is pure,\" \"this is dirty,\" \"this is a friend,\" \"this is an enemy,\" and so on arise on the basis of terms, the expression of speech. All thoughts that arise on the basis of the body and the ones that arise on the basis of speech equally occur in connection with names. Thus all thoughts arise on the basis of terms and are therefore just nominal. Freedom from con­ceptual elaboration is the state of peace in which all thoughts have subsided.Annotation 33:The unpurified phase corresponds to the tathagatagarbha in terms of the basis (Tib. gzhi de gshegs snying po). The partly unpurified and partly purified phase corresponds to the tathagatagarbha in terms of the path (Tib. lam de gshegs snying po), and the utterly purified phase corresponds to the tathagatagarbha in terms of the fruit (Tib. 'bras bu de gshegs snying po).When it is said that during the partly unpurified and partly puri­fied phase buddha nature is purified to a certain degree, this means the following: Once the buddha nature is purified from all the defile­ments that are to be abandoned on the paths of seeing and medita­tion, the level of the fruit, the state of buddhahood, is reached. A bodhi- sattva has not attained this fruit, but is purified from these defilements to a certain degree, corresponding to the level he has reached. When,Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 349"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"350 Buddha Naturefor instance, the first bodhisattva level is attained, one is purified from the veil to be abandoned through seeing. When one has reached the second or third bodhisattva level, one is purified from the veil to be abandoned through seeing; in addition to that, one is purified from the coarse aspect of the defilements to be abandoned through medita­tion, to a degree corresponding to each of these levels.One may wonder why buddha nature, although it pervades all sen­tient beings, is expressed by the three different names of \"being,\" \"bodhisattva,\" and \"tathagata.\" This is due to a different degree of purification from the adventitious stains of delusion. The true state itself is not of different kinds. Nevertheless there is a difference con­cerning the individuals who are the basis of this true state or buddha nature: There are those who have not purified the adventitious stains at all, those who have purified them to a respective degree, and fi­nally those who have completely purified all defilements without ex­ception. These three different types of individuals are explained by means of the aforementioned three names.Annotation 34:This section clarifies that as far as the essence is concerned there is not the slightest difference between the three aspects of the basis tathagata- garbha, the path tathagatagarbha, and the fruit tathagatagarbha. This is the view of the Shantong Madhyamaka. If one understands it well, one will find it easy to understand the teachings on Mahamudra. These teachings also introduce the three aspects of basis, path, and fruit. In this context one speaks of basis Mahamudra, path Mahamudra, and fruit Mahamudra, the essence of which is considered as being insepa­rable. The fact that the essence is unchanging has been shown in de­tail by means of the examples of the sky, of water containing mud, and of gold. The different phases of basis, path, and fruit as they are explained in this section are presented from the viewpoint of there being a difference only in the degree of purification from the adventi­tious defilements. With regard to the essence itself, to the tathagata­garbha, there is not the slightest difference. When the system of the Rangtong Madhyamaka speaks of the essence being undifferentiated, this essence is synonymous with emptiness, with freedom from con­ceptual elaboration. It does not refer to the inseparable union of spa­ciousness and primordial wisdom, as is the case in the Shantong Madhyamaka system."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 351Annotation 35:Space is characterized by being empty and providing an opportunity. Space is empty in that it is nothing at all, and it provides an opportu­nity in that it does not constitute the slightest obstruction and thus allows the appearance of any visible object. The quality of the dharma- dhatu is peace in the sense of freedom from all conceptual elaboration.Annotation 36:The characteristic of a thing (Tib. dngos po) is the power to fulfill a function (Tib. don byed pa'i nus pa).Annotation 37:When it is stated that the skandhas, the elements, and the sense facul­ties are bound up with pollution (Tib. zag bcas), this refers to the fact that they are subject to arising and disintegration.Annotation 38:The skandhas are said to attract suffering (Tib. nye bar len pa dang bcas pa) since they come into existence due to the predominating influence of the karma and mental poisons of previous existences. Since former actions and mental poisons are the source of the skandhas, from the mere presence of these skandhas suffering will ensue. A human be­ing, for instance, will invariably experience suffering by the mere fact that he or she has a physical bodyImproper conceptual activity (Tib. tshul bzhin ma yin pa'i yid la byed pa) is equivalent to wrong or perverted thoughts, such as taking some­thing that is impure to be pure, something that does not exist as a self to be an existing self, something that is impermanent to be perma­nent, suffering to be happiness, and so on.Annotation 39:The view expressed in this and the following section is very similar to the view as it is presented in the Mahamudra system. When the na­ture of mind is described as being the luminous dharmadhatu (Tib. od gsal chos kyi dbyings), this is to say that the nature of mind is not just empty, but has the aspect of clarity as well. The term \"luminosity\" or \"clear light\" (Tib. od gsal) refers to this aspect of clarity, whereas the term \"dharmadhatu\" refers to the aspect of emptiness. Thus the nature"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"352 Buddha Natureof mind is the inseparable union of emptiness and clear light (Tib. gsal stong dbyer med). This nature of mind is similar to space, which pro­vides the basis for all things but in itself has not come into existence on the basis of a cause, and is thus uncreated. Likewise the nature of mind does not depend upon productive causes (Tib. nyer len gyi rgyu), nor on simultaneously active conditions (Tib. lhan cig byed pa'i rkyen). The productive cause of a flower, for example, is the seed. The simul­taneously active conditions befriending and furthering its growth are earth, water, warmth, and so forth. Since the nature of mind is not dependent upon causes and conditions and therefore also not depen­dent upon a gathering of these, it is free from an initial arising. If there is no initial arising due to a gathering of causes and conditions, there is also no final cessation, nor an abiding in the meantime. Thus the nature of mind is free from arising, abiding, and ceasing, which are the three properties of anything created.Annotation 40:Bodhisattvas who have reached the bodhisattva levels have directly realized thatness, or the nature of the tathagatagarbha. As long as one is an ordinary being, one only realizes this nature by way of deduc­tion. Thus one's meditation is tinged by a concept of it. When empti­ness is realized directly, one has reached a state of freedom from the obscuration of thoughts. Emptiness is not an object for thoughts and concepts. It is realized immediately, just as it appears, in a state of freedom from conceptual elaboration in which all thoughts have sub­sided. Even now, for example, people like us will have meditative ex­periences connected with thoughts, and at times we will have experi­ences that are free from thought. These thought-free experiences, how­ever, are not very subtle. At our stage a very subtle thought-free un­derstanding will only occur while we are sleeping or, sometimes, while our mind is immersed in great bliss. Nevertheless, for the time being our mind is a coarse, conceptual one that constantly focuses outwards and conceptually perceives a conceptualized object. In this state one does not know experience that is free from thought. Within direct re­alization of emptiness there is neither conceptual perception nor a conceptualized object. It is nakedly realized, just as it appears.Due to their direct realization of emptiness, bodhisattvas have devel­oped great compassion for all those sentient beings who have not yet gained this realization and must therefore undergo an immeasurable"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"amount of suffering. This can be understood by means of the example of dreaming: If someone dreams that he is burnt by fire, he knows the suffering connected with this experience. Once he recognizes it to be a dream appearance, no matter how often he dreams of being burnt by fire, he will no longer feel the slightest suffering. Yet, when seeing others who have the same dream but do not recognize that they are dreaming, his own experience of suffering and his recognition of its being just a dream will generate compassion for these other beings. If at the time when one has recognized that one is dreaming and thus does not experience any suffering oneself, one sees one's friends or one's own father and mother dreaming that they are caught in a fire and, not recognizing their dream for what it is, being helplessly deliv­ered to their suffering, one will give rise to heartfelt compassion for them. In this way the bodhisattvas have great compassion for all those beings who in their state of unknowing are bound to the cycle of exist­ence and the suffering it involves.Once one has directly realized buddha nature, one is free from karma and the mental poisons and thus free from birth, which comes about through their predominating influence. Being free from birth, one is also free from death, sickness, and aging, which occur as a consequence of birth. Thus one is free from the process of disintegration starting with birth and ending with death. One is not subject to any change. Though through their direct realization of buddha nature they are freed from birth and so on, bodhisattvas are fully activated and alert be­cause of the power of their great love and compassion. Therefore they demonstrate birth, sickness, aging, and death and appear to the vi­sion of others as if they were subject to disintegration and change.In this context, one's own vision (Tib. rang snang) and the vision of others (Tib. gzhan snang) are to be distinguished. From the viewpoint of their own vision, the bodhisattvas do not have real skandhas in terms of the individual characteristic of the skandhas (Tib. rang mtshan par med pa). They appear in the form of skandhas to the vision of others. In order to understand this, one can look into the question of what kind of body is possessed by a person of whom one dreams. The body of this dream person does not have the individual characteristic of an outer physical body. It appears in the likeness of it. It appears as an enemy or friend, and one can see it experience suffering and misery. As shown by this example, bodhisattvas, once they have directly realized empti­ness, do not have real skandhas themselves, but demonstrate realExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 353"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"354 Buddha Natureskandhas to the other beings. Though changeless, they show them­selves to the vision of others as if they were actually changing. Al­though they are not subject to this process, they show themselves as if they were born, falling ill, aging, and finally dying, in order to help all ordinary beings gain the realization they themselves have attained.The main force enabling bodhisattvas to take birth in an existence corresponding to their intention is the power of their former wishing prayers for the benefit of others. Even while a bodhisattva is still an ordinary being, and throughout the time that he travels the bodhi­sattva path, a very important means for his future ability to accom­plish the benefit of beings is his vast and sincere wishing prayers. These will contain the wish that he may gain this future ability and be only of help to others. An example is the Wishing Prayer for Entering the Bodhisattva's Path by Shantideva, in which he prays that he may trans­form into food for the hungry, into clothes for the naked, into a bridge for wanderers who are stuck by turbulent water, and so on. In short, wishing prayers such as these are the cause that will lead one to gain the power to dispel the suffering of beings.Annotation 41:\"The four means of attraction\" (Tib. bsdu ba'i dngos po bzhi) are the giving of desired material necessities (Tib. mkho ba sbyin pa), speaking agreeably (Tib. snyan par smra ba), teaching in accordance with the ben­efit of the worldly beings (Tib. 'jig rten don mthun pa), and conduct that is of benefit to the disciples (Tib. gdul bya'i don ¡a spyod pa). Once one has become a bodhisattva who dwells on the bodhisattva levels, one makes use of the four means to gather beings into an assembly and thus help them to reach realization themselves. The first means of at­traction is the giving of material things that a disciple needs or de­sires. The second is the fact that a bodhisattva knows what will make each individual sentient being happy. Thus he will speak to them in friendly words, he will sing, tell stories, and do whatever makes sen­tient beings feel warm and cozy. The third is the fact that a bodhi­sattva knows which of the teachings of the smaller or greater vehicles will be of benefit to each individual being. Due to this knowledge, he will teach them accordingly. The fourth is the fact that a bodhisattva's conduct will always be in accordance with the respective level of teach­ing he gives."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 355Annotation 42:A bodhisattva who dwells on the eighth bhumi has attained the level of non-returning in that he will not fall back to a stage in which one perceives in terms of characteristics during the post-meditative phase. Such a bodhisattva has completely abandoned the conceptual elabo­ration consisting of the perception of objects in terms of their character­istics, such as \"this is a flower,\" \"this is white,\" \"this is red,\" and so on.Annotation 43:Bodhisattvas who dwell on the tenth bodhisattva level are called \"those who have reached the last existence,\" since the next step in the career of such a bodhisattva is the attainment of buddhahood.When it is said that these bodhisattvas are free from all thoughts and ideation, having eliminated these in the process of a complete transformation of state (Tib. ngas yongs su gyur pa), this means that the ordinary consciousness has been transformed into primordial wisdom. Through this transformation all concepts are also transformed and thereby relinquished.A bodhisattva who has reached the tenth bhumi is capable of ema­nating an almost unimaginably great number of form kayas, of physi­cal bodies, which are illusory appearances (Tib. sprul pa). A small amount of this capacity is first attained when one reaches the first bodhisattva level, and it will grow gradually throughout the follow­ing levels. On the first bodhisattva level one is able to emanate a hun­dred illusory physical bodies, on the second level one is able to ema­nate a thousand, and so forth. (For further information see Hopkins, Meditation on Emptiness, p. 100.) These emanations, however, are not equivalent to the sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya of a buddha.A bodhisattva who dwells on the tenth bodhisattva level appears to the disciples as an ordinary being, but is of a different nature. His or her very nature is the accomplishment of the welfare of all sentient beings.Annotation 44:Dolpopa Sangja, the founder of the Jonangpa school, has written a famous commentary on the Uttara Tantra Shastra.

While according to Dolpopa and Jamgon Kongtriil the Great the root text does not differentiate between the qualities of a bodhisattva who dwells on the ninth bodhisattva level and those of a bodhisattva who has reached the tenth bodhisattva level, the Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje interprets the three stanzas starting with \"By the power of their former [prayers]...\" slightly differently. In his opinion the first two describe the qualities of a bodhisattva who dwells on the ninth bodhi­sattva level, while the last stanza starting with \"Always [acting] spon­taneously and without obstruction...\" describes the qualities of a bodhisattva who has reached the tenth bodhisattva level.Annotation 45:When one has reached the highest state of a shravaka arhat, one is an arhat without remainder. This refers to the fact that at this point even the subtle remainders of the skandhas have been overcome. In this state the stream of being is cut. There is no activity whatsoever and therefore no possibility to bring about the benefit of beings. Such an arhat abides in a state of extinction similar to an extinguished fire or stagnant water. Once the stream of being is cut there will be no further birth. One has reached the nirvana equivalent to mere peace. Even in the expanse of this nirvana without remainder the dharmakaya pos­sesses inexhaustible and immeasurable qualities and is therefore per­manent. When one attains the dharmakaya, one possesses these quali­ties. While the shravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats who are without any remainder of skandhas are like an extinguished fire and their streams of being are cut, a buddha does not cut the stream of being. In the expanse of the nirvana without remainder he also has the thirty- two qualities of the dharmakaya. Arising on the basis of these quali­ties are the form kayas, which have the quality of being uninterrupted in appearance. They are the means that bring about the benefit of all sentient beings.When someone who follows the Shravakayana or Pratyekabuddha- yana reaches the nirvana without remainder, any remainder of skandhas is merely extinct and has gone into nothingness, whereas someone who follows the bodhisattva path and employs the specific means of the Vajrayana will realize emptiness directly and thereby attain the form kaya of emptiness. Through the immediate vision of emptiness, the ordinary body, which is of the nature of flesh and blood,"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsui trim Gyamtso Rinpoche 357is transformed into the nature of light and one attains what is called \"the rainbow body.\" On the level of buddhahood all skandhas are utterly purified and the form kaya of emptiness is finally achieved.Annotation 46:As has been explained before, arhats have a birth in a body of mental nature. In consequence they undergo a subtle process of falling sick and aging, until they finally die in a way inconceivable to an ordinary being. This is because they have not yet overcome the very subtle ob­scuration consisting of the remaining imprints of ignorance. The dharmakaya is even free from these types of birth, death, sickness, and aging.Annotation 47:The tathagatagarbha (Tib. de bzhin gshegs pa'i snyingpo, lit. \"essence or heart of a tathagata\") in the utterly purified phase is the dharmakaya of all buddhas. With respect to the classification in terms of the three kayas, the dharmakaya of all buddhas is considered to be of one and the same essence. Of the form kayas, which manifest on the basis of this dharmakaya, the sambhogakaya is considered to be one and the same, whereas the nirmanakaya is considered as being of different kinds. This different manifestation comes about due to the wishing prayers uttered by a buddha while traveling the bodhisattva path.The tathagatagarbha in the utterly purified phase is also the Tathagata. The term \"Tathagata\" (Tib. de bzhin gshegs pa), an epithet of the Buddha, can be explained as follows. De bzhin is short for de bzhin nyid (Skt. tathata, suchness) and gshegs pa is a honorific term meaning \"the One who has gone.\" Thus the Tathagata can be described as the One who has traveled the path of suchness, of the true state (Skt. dharmata, Tib. chos nyid), or in other words, the One who has relied on the path of suchness that abides in neither of the extremes of existence and peace, and thus has truly gone to great enlightenment. An equiva­lent for the term \"Tathagata\" is the term \"Sugata\" (Tib. bde bar gshegs pa). Accordingly the tathagatagarbha is also called the sugatagarbha (Tib. bde bar gshegs pa'i snyingpo). The Tibetan term bde ba means \"hap­piness\" or \"bliss.\" The term bde bar is an adverb and means \"comfort­ably.\" Thus a buddha is called the Sugata, since he or she can be de­scribed as the One who has relied on the bodhisattva vehicle, which constitutes a comfortable path, and thus has gone to the fruit, the level of perfect buddhahood, which is bliss."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"358 Buddha NatureThe tathagatagarbha in the utterly purified phase is the noble truth, since it is the truth of cessation of all noble ones.It is also the absolute nirvana. Only the state of buddhahood consti­tutes the ultimate nirvana, whereas the nirvana reached by shravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats is a limited and temporary one.The dharmakaya of all buddhas, the Tathagata, the noble truth, and the absolute nirvana are but synonymous terms, being just different aspects that have the same essence.Furthermore, the ten powers and so on, that is, the thirty-two quali­ties of the dharmakaya, are also completely inseparable from the dharmakaya itself. In terms of essence there is no differentiation.For these reasons there is no actual or true nirvana except for per­fect buddhahood.Annotation 48:\"Emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects\" (Tib. mam kun mchog Idan stong pa nyid) is a name for the true nature of mind, or the way the mind truly exists, which is the inseparable union of emptiness and clear light. The emptiness of all outer objects, such as forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangible objects, and so forth, is called \"emptiness endowed with the aspect of matter\" (Tib. hem po mam bcas kyi stong pa nyid).Annotation 49:The painter who is the only one to know how to paint the head of the king stands for discriminative wisdom fully and thoroughly discrimi­nating all phenomena. His having gone abroad and the painting stay­ing unfinished signifies the fact that without this discriminative wis­dom, by means of the first five perfections alone, it is impossible to accomplish the direct manifestation of the dharmakaya. This direct manifestation of the dharmakaya, or in other words, of emptiness en­dowed with all the supreme aspects of means, corresponds to the well- painted image of the king being fully perfected.Annotation 50:What is to be understood by primordial wisdom and discriminative wisdom is explained slightly differently in the Rangtong and Shantong systems.(1) According to the Rangtong view, there is a relationship between these in terms of cause and fruit. Discriminative wisdom is consid­ered as being the cause and primordial wisdom as being the fruit. In"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 359this view discriminative wisdom is equivalent to the three discrimi­native wisdoms arising from learning, reflection, and meditation (Tib. thos bsam sgom byunggi shes tab). According to the Rangtong tradition, ordinary beings do not possess primordial wisdom. This is only true of noble ones, of bodhisattvas who have reached the bodhisattva levels. In this context two aspects are distinguished: primordial wisdom present during meditation and the one present in the post-meditative phase (Tib. mnyam bzhaggi ye shes dang rjes thob kyi ye shes). Once emp­tiness is no longer a passing experience but realized directly, one has reached the first bodhisattva level by means of this direct realization. From this moment onwards, the two primordial wisdoms are present. The primordial wisdom present during meditation is the one that re­alizes emptiness. It manifests while a noble bodhisattva rests in medi­tative equipoise, one-pointedly within emptiness itself. The wisdom present in the post-meditative phase is wisdom that realizes all phe­nomena as being mere appearances, as being dream-like or like magi­cal illusions. This wisdom manifests whenever a noble bodhisattva does not dwell in meditation.(2) According to the Shantong tradition, primordial wisdom is what is to be realized and discriminative wisdom is the means to realize it.In this view, discriminative wisdom is of two kinds, these being the discriminative wisdom focusing outwards and the one focusing in­wards. Generally speaking, discriminative wisdom is the ability to individually discriminate each and every object. This ability in its as­pect of focusing outwards is also native to ordinary beings. In the Shantong view, discriminative wisdom constitutes the ability to dis­cern all relative phenomena, each individually, and to know them for what they are. While the relative phenomena are examined by means of discriminative wisdom, their way of existence and their way of appearance are understood. It is seen that they are empty, lacking in­herent existence, that they do not truly exist and yet appear on a rela­tive level like a dream image or a magical illusion.In the Shantong view, primordial wisdom is considered as being within all sentient beings. This is because in this view it is no other than the mind itself in terms of its true existence. The essence of mind is emptiness and its nature is clear light. These two aspects being in­separable, primordial wisdom is equivalent to the inseparable union of emptiness and clear light, or of spaciousness and awareness. With regard to this primordial wisdom three aspects are distinguished: those of the basis, path, and fruit. The primordial wisdom present within all"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"360 Buddha Naturebeings needs to be realized in order to reveal itself immediately or di­rectly. This realization has to take place in such a way that primordial wisdom itself recognizes its own face (Tib. ye shes rang ngor shes pa). The primordial wisdom present from the very beginning within the stream of being, which is the true nature of the minds of all sentient beings, the inseparable union of emptiness and clear light, is called the basis primordial wisdom and also \"ever-present wisdom\" or \"ever­present dharmakaya.\" The phase in which this nature of mind is ini­tially realized and during which this realization is cultivated is called the path primordial wisdom. At the time when all the adventitious stains of delusion are eliminated, this inseparable union of emptiness and clear light is called the fruit primordial wisdom.(3) The view of Mahamudra is very similar to the Shantong view. In this context one speaks of basis Mahamudra, path Mahamudra, and fruit Mahamudra. Once the primordial wisdom present since the very beginning, which in this context is called \"the joint manifestation of emptiness and clear light,\" sees its face through discriminative wis­dom having become self-liberated, the realization of Mahamudra has become immediate.Annotation 51:(1) The topic \"essence\" shows enlightenment as possessing two as­pects of purity. The term \"sphere\" refers to the dharmadhatu being concept-free or free from any mental elaboration. The second type of purity marks the difference between an ordinary and a fully enlight­ened being. In the foregoing chapter the inconceivability of buddha nature was described by the words: \"[The buddha element] is pure and yet has affliction.\" While the nature of mind is primordially pure, it is obscured by the adventitious stains of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge in the state of an ordinary being. A second type of purity needs to be achieved—this consists of the elimination of all these veils. Once total purification has joined the ever-present purity of the nature of mind, there is the enlightenment of a buddha endowed with twofold purity.(2) The cause bringing about this twofold purity is described as the practice of the path of the meditative and post-meditative phases. These consist of two types of primordial wisdom, which are \"utterly non­conceptualizing wisdom in meditation\" and \"wisdom thoroughly dis­criminating all knowable objects in post-meditation\" (Tib. mnyam bzhag mam par mi rtog pa'i ye shes dang rjes thob shes bya mam par 'byed pa'i ye"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"shes). While abiding in total pacification of any mental elaboration one will eventually come to feel the nature of mind itself, which is the union of spaciousness and awareness. When during meditation one dwells evenly balanced and one-pointedly immersed in this nature of mind, there will be insight called \"utterly non-conceptualizing wis­dom in meditation.\" This means that there is primordial wisdom that is not bound up with or does not involve any concept. By the power of this thought-free wisdom, there is \"the wisdom thoroughly discrimi­nating all knowable objects in post-meditation.\" While not meditat­ing, all phenomena are seen in their ultimate and relative aspects. Ul­timately they are seen as being by nature not truly existent, as being luminous emptiness, and at the same time their way of appearance is known. On the relative level all phenomena are seen as being dream­like or like a magical illusion. This means that in post-meditation a firm and invincible certainty of knowing the absolute and relative truths will arise. Taking these two primordial wisdoms as one's path, one will attain twofold purity, which is the essence of ultimate enlightenment.Moving towards this aim, a noble bodhisattva will abide in the in­divisible union of spaciousness and awareness while resting in medi­tative equipoise, and thereafter gather the accumulation of merit to the vastest possible extent. This accumulation is carried out while knowing that it is ultimately empty and relatively illusory, like a dream or a magical illusion. In the language of the Dharma there are various ways of expressing this. Here non-conceptualizing wisdom and wis­dom discriminating each and every phenomenon are described as the causes of buddhahood.(3) Through relying on the path of these two primordial wisdoms one attains the fruit, which is freedom from the two veils of the men­tal poisons and hindrances to knowledge. The topics \"essence\" and \"fruit\" are partly similar in meaning, but emphasize different aspects. While the first describes enlightenment as a state of utter purity, the second stresses the fact that there is freedom from the pollution of the two veils.(4) Through eliminating both veils—the mental poisons and hin­drances to knowledge—a function unfolds, which is the accomplish­ment of the benefit of oneself and others. Without achieving benefit for oneself, one is not able to achieve the benefit of others. Though a bodhisattva mainly concentrates on bringing about the good of others and will not do so with his or her sake in mind, still one's own benefit or enlightenment has to come first. Otherwise one lacks the powerExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 361"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"362 Buddha Naturenecessary to achieve the benefit of others, just as someone who does not know English himself could not communicate in this language with others.(5) The basis for the fulfillment of the two benefits is provided by those buddha qualities that are the thirty-two qualities of the dharma­kaya. These are called \"inconceivable\" since they are very hard to fathom and an ordinary being cannot understand them as they truly are.(6) Enlightenment manifests in terms of the three kayas, which are the svabhavikakaya or dharmakaya, the sambhogakaya, and the nirmanakaya. The term \"sambhogakaya\" (Tib. longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku) literally means \"body of perfect enjoyment\" and is explained as the kaya perfectly enjoying the Dharma of the Great Vehicle. The dis­ciples of the sambhogakaya are the bodhisattvas who dwell on one of the ten bhumis. To them it manifests visibly as the five buddha fami­lies and so forth, teaching the Dharma by means of different aspects, such as ornaments, gestures, and so on, without needing to express the instructions in words. The term \"nirmanakaya\" (Tib. sprul pa'i sku) literally means \"emanation body\" or \"body of illusory appearance.\" It teaches the ordinary beings by manifesting in various illusory ap­pearances corresponding to their different kinds. To a human a nirmanakaya appears in human form, to a god in god's form, to an animal in animal form, and so on.Generally speaking, when explained in accordance with the Shantong view, the three kayas are to be understood as follows: The joint mani­festation of the realization of the essence and of liberated primordial wisdom of awareness is called dharmakaya (Tib. snying rtogs dang rig pa'i ye shes sgrol ba zung 'jug chos kyi sku). The form kayas manifest without moving away or being apart from this dharmakaya. The as­pect appearing to bodhisattvas of the ten bhumis in the form of signs and symbols is called the sambhogakaya, and the aspect appearing to ordinary beings in accordance with their aspirations, manifesting a reflection of buddhahood in whichever form appropriate, is called the nirmanakaya.When buddhahood is presented in terms of five kayas, two further aspects are distinguished, which are called \"the kaya of actual enlight­enment\" and \"the vajra kaya\" (Tib. mngon par byang chub pa'i sku dang rdo rje sku). The first refers to the fact that the realization of the three kayas does not involve any pride. When, on the path of training, we think of \"reaching enlightenment,\" we will believe that someone who has achieved this feat will feel extremely capable and special. In truth,"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 363though, the actual reaching of enlightenment does not entail any such notion. The vajra kaya denotes the fact that buddhahood is indivisible and that the three kayas, therefore, are of one and the same essence.(7) Buddhahood is permanent in that the dharmakaya is as unchang­ing as space and the form kayas are uninterrupted in appearance as long as sentient beings exist.(8) When the first bodhisattva level is reached, the dharmakaya or the dharmata, the true state of everything, is realized directly and an ordinary being becomes a noble bodhisattva. Until this realization has taken place the final ultimate truth is inconceivable.Annotation 52:In the teachings pertaining to the middling turning of the wheel of Dharma, all the direct instructions on emptiness contain the defini­tive meaning (Skt. nitártha, Tib. nges don), whereas anything else is relative and conveys a provisional statement (Skt. neyartha, Tib. drang don) leading up to the absolute truth, the direct vision of emptiness. Literally drang ba means \"leading towards.\" In the Shantong view, which the Buddha taught during his third turning of the wheel of Dharma, the definitive meaning as presented by the second turning is not the final and ultimate one. Definitively true are the teachings on the nature of mind clearly showing it as the indivisible union of spa­ciousness and awareness. (For the meaning of \"nitartha\" and \"neyartha\" see Part Four, note 10.)Annotation 53:As shown above (annotation 51) the enlightenment of a buddha comes about through two types of primordial wisdom. When one attains the utterly non-conceptualizing wisdom of meditation, the wisdom thor­oughly discriminating all knowable objects in post-meditation will arise as well. Jetsiin Milarepa, for instance, directly realized Maha- mudra through the utterly non-conceptualizing wisdom of medita­tion. On the basis of this realization his mind became totally clear as to all phenomena, and in post-meditation he knew and remembered ev­erything without having to rely on books. The Buddha himself has said that when firm realization of his words is achieved, full clarity of mind with regard to any relative phenomenon will be present simultaneously. In the light of the two types of primordial wisdom one will know all phenomena as being ultimately empty and like a dream appearance or a magical illusion on the relative level. Someone who has this vision"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"364 Buddha Naturewill carry out any action, such as being generous, making offerings, and so forth, with the perception of discriminative wisdom not fo­cused on the three spheres, or wheels, of subject, object, and action.Luminous clarity, or clear light, is inseparable from the nature of primordial wisdom. This means that the qualities of enlightenment are inseparable from those of the basis, which is the nature of mind. They are of one and the same essence. If there was no clarity in the state of the basis, there could not be the realization of clarity when attaining the fruit. In the Shántong view the true nature of mind is the inseparable union of emptiness and clarity. Once it has been freed from all the adventitious defilements, the realization of clarity will come about. If, as according to the Rangtong view, the basis did not hold any clarity, primordial wisdom would be something that newly arises. If this was the case, it would come about on the basis of causes and conditions. As such it would be created, and being created it would not last and would finally be destroyed. Furthermore, if the nature of mind was solely empty, there could not be the inseparable union of spaciousness and primordial wisdom in the state of the fruit. Spacious­ness is equivalent to emptiness. If spaciousness and awareness or clar­ity were not already inseparable in the state of the basis, they could not become inseparable in the state of the fruit.Annotation 54:When it is said that the dharmakaya is indivisibly manifest in the na­ture of all sentient beings, this means the following:The only difference between the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness, which is the nature of the minds of all sentient beings, and this union being endowed with twofold purity is the fact that the latter is free from all the adventitious stains, while the former is still obscured by these. The essence of the true state of mind is naturally pure, and with regard to this aspect there is not the slightest differ­ence between an ordinary and an enlightened being. The empty sphere of space, for instance, is the same in all empty vessels. Nevertheless, a difference comes about due to the different kinds of vessels. Space itself is not of different kinds and without there being different kinds of vessels there will not be different kinds of space. Once the vessel is broken, the space around it and the space within will become insepa­rable. In the same way, the dharmakaya is indivisibly manifest in the nature of all sentient beings. Both the dharmakaya and the nature of the minds of beings are the inseparable union of spaciousness and"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 365awareness. As to their essence there is no difference. For this reason, basis, path, and fruit are undifferentiated according to the terminol­ogy of the Shantong and Mahamudra traditions. Though basis tathagata­garbha, path tathagatagarbha, and fruit tathagatagarbha are no dif­ferent in essence, still the adventitious stains need to be abandoned in order to attain the fruit. In this respect, there is a difference, which is expressed in the lines: \"All sentient beings are buddha but obscured by adventitious stains.\" As has been said before, this can be under­stood by means of the example of gold when still contained in ore and when totally freed from all the surrounding dross. As far as the purity of the gold is concerned, there is no difference in both cases. Never­theless, it will appear as if it has changed once all the dross is removed.There is only a seeming change, though, and the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness within all sentient beings will reveal itself as the ever-present dharmakaya, once freed from all its adventi­tious veils. The nature of beings and the dharmakaya will merge and prove to be inseparable. This is shown in the Mahayanasutralamkara (Tib. mdo sde rgyan) and similar scriptures by means of many examples. As was said before, space only appears as a variety due to vessels of various shape. Similarly, all small and great rivers on this planet fi­nally flow into the great ocean. Each takes its individual course through an individual country and has its individual name, but the moment it reaches the sea, its waters become inseparable from the ocean. Thus all water is the same. When many thousands of different butterlamps are burning in one place, each gives off its light and yet all these lights merge and become inseparable.When it is said that the dharmakaya has spontaneously possessed all the properties of a buddha since beginningless time, this means that the qualities of buddhahood are not something newly attained. If they were, they would be conditioned. The empty nature of mind is not brought about by causes and conditions, and thus is uncreated and spontaneously present. If this was to be joined by newly arising— and therefore conditioned—qualities, these qualities could never be­come inseparable from the true state of the mind, which is emptiness present since the very beginning.Annotation 55:The statement that the stains obscuring the pure nature of mind have not been truly existent since beginningless time can be understood by the example of dream. When one dreams of being burnt by fire or"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"366 Buddha Naturecarried away by a flood, this fire and water have never existed in any way. If during a dream attachment towards pleasant objects and aver­sion towards unpleasant objects arise, these objects of attachment and aversion have had no existence since the very beginning. Therefore, the mental poisons based upon these objects are also not existent in the light of the ultimate truth. They come into the mind as something fleeting and adventitious, like clouds in the sky.While all faults are adventitious, the qualities are spontaneously present. In the Shantong view, all faults are self-empty (Tib. rang stong), while the qualities are not empty of their own essence. They are other- empty (Tib. gzhan stong). This is to say that the nature of mind is empty of all faults, of everything foreign to it, but it is not empty of the spon­taneously present qualities, of everything native to it. As it is stated in the section explaining the tathagatagarbha (B.II.2.2.2.1.3.5.2):The element is empty of the adventitious [stains], which are featured by their total separateness.But it is not empty of the matchless properties, which are featured by their total inseparability.While dreaming of being burnt by fire, carried away by water, and so forth, all these outer faults that arise when the mind focuses out­wards will prove to be adventitious once the dream is recognized. They come and go. Yet while this happens, the nature of mind, the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness, does not undergo any change. Based upon this fact, the practice of the secret Mantrayana unfolds its power. If the true state of mind was not the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness, what benefit could arise from the meditation on a yidam deity? If there was no coexistence of the body having an impure nature and the mind being inherently pure, there would not be the slightest benefit in meditating on any deity. Since the mind in terms of its true existence is spaciousness and aware­ness inseparable, the meditation on the pure form of a yidam deity will purify the impure appearance and perception of the physical body. Then the true deity, which is this spaciousness and awareness insepa­rable, will reveal itself and become immediately apparent. All yidam practices, such as meditating on Avalokiteshvara, Amitabha, Vajravarahi, and so forth, singly serve the purpose of purifying this impure appearance that the physical body seems to be. When the true deity is the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness, the meditation on a deity being visualized in its likeness has the power to lead one to the achievement and realization of the true deity, of the"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"nature of mind. If spaciousness and awareness inseparable was not present in the impure phase already, if everything was nothing at all or mere emptiness, and if both faults and qualities were like space, one could not attain any quality.The faults consist of the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge, the former being the obstacle to liberation and the lat­ter the obstacle to omniscience. When one has attained the level of a shravaka or pratyekabuddha arhat, one has only purified the veil of the mental poisons and thereby reached liberation to the extent of be­ing liberated from the cycle of existence. One has not yet attained the state of omniscience. In order to reach that state as well, one must abandon the veil of the hindrances to knowledge.Annotation 56:Generally speaking, correct realization or \"realizing as it is\" (Tib. yz Ita ba rtogs pa) refers to the direct understanding of emptiness; complete realization or \"realizing as much as there is\" (Tib. ji snyed pa rtogs pa) refers to all relative appearances. In the explanations pertaining to the Shantong system, ultimate correct realization is direct understanding of the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness, and com­plete realization is direct understanding of all relative, artificial ap­pearances.The three realms are the desire realm, the realm of form, and the formless realm. Primordial wisdom, which is completely free from ideation, acts as the remedy for the mental poisons of the three realms, or in other words, for the concepts entertained by the beings of these realms. As for the term \"concept\" or \"thought,\" the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge, when put concisely, are noth­ing but concepts. While the veil of the hindrances to knowledge con­sists of very subtle kinds of concepts, the veil of the mental poisons constitutes the very coarse types. If, for instance, desire arises on the basis of something pleasant, and aversion comes up on the basis of something unpleasant that is viewed as being hostile, these are very gross and rough concepts and a sentient being with these reactions has a coarse mind. The veil of the hindrances to knowledge has three aspects in terms of progressively subtler concepts. The first is holding on to true existence (Tib. bden par 'dzin pa), the second is holding on to characteristics (Tib. mtshan mar 'dzin pa), and the third is the appearance of duality (Tib. gnyis snang). Towards the last-mentioned aspect people like us will develop an extremely subtle concept, whereas a bodhisattvaExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 367"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"368 Buddha Naturewho dwells on the tenth bhumi will perceive the mere appearance of duality as such without conceptualizing it any further. Here again the dream example is helpful to develop an understanding. What will happen if during a dream one realizes that one is dreaming? When one recognizes one's dream for what it is, appearance will be there but holding on to its true existence will be ended. Then the power of direct recognition will arise. Similarly, bodhisattvas who dwell on one of the ten bodhisattva levels have realized the meaning of emptiness. Not leaving it at this initial realization but cultivating it to ever subtler levels, one will gain a respectively firm ability that, having become unshakable, will lead one to attain the state of a buddha.Primordial wisdom completely free from ideation is to be under­stood as thought-free primordial wisdom or primordial wisdom re­leased from any thought or concept. It can be explained, for instance, through the teachings on valid cognition. In this context four types of valid cognition are distinguished: direct valid cognition of the senses (Tib. dbang po mngon sum tshad ma), direct valid cognition of intellect (Tib. jid mngon sum tshad ma), self-aware direct valid cognition (Tib. rang rig tshad ma), and direct valid cognition in yoga or in meditation endowed with bliss (Tib. rnal 'byor mngon sum tshad ma). The last-men­tioned is described as \"knowing, which arising from meditation, is free from mental elaboration and undeluded.\" The term \"knowing\" is to be understood as being equivalent to primordial wisdom. Through cultivating the knowing or primordial wisdom which arising from meditation is free from mental elaboration and undeluded to its final unlimited extent, one will reach the level of buddhahood.The term \"cultivation\" or \"meditation\" (Tib. sgom pa) is defined as follows: Once direct realization of the true nature is reached, one leaves the mind unwaveringly within this realization without giving rise to distraction and thus purifies one's stream of being. In the traditions of Mahamudra and the Mantrayana it is appropriate to apply this culti­vation in all daily activities and any form of conduct. Especially when one has attained a good realization of Mahamudra, one has the power to meditate on the meaning of Mahamudra while carrying out any work or activity. Since the ultimate true nature of Mahamudra is the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness, one will be able to work and act within this vision of spaciousness and awareness in­separable. If, as in the Rangtong system, the true nature of Mahamudra is viewed as being merely empty, one will meditate evenly balanced in mere emptiness and the consciousnesses of the six senses will cease."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"According to this tradition, the consciousness of all outer appearances, such as the eyes seeing form, the ears hearing sound and so on, must be stopped, whereupon one has to meditate one-pointedly on emptiness. According to the Mahamudra tradition, one has to gain the ability to meditate in everyday life while carrying out any kind of activity. This is what is meant by the inseparable union of spaciousness and aware­ness or of emptiness and clarity. The presence or non-presence of emp­tiness and clarity inseparable leads to different types of meditation. The difference is mainly marked by the aspect of clarity, by the ques­tion whether the nature of mind is viewed as holding clear light or not.In his song for Rechungpa on turning daily behavior into a prac­tice, Jetsiin Milarepa said:At times I eat, and while eating I meditate.When meditating while eating and eating,I know eating and drinking to be a ritual feast.These instructions I have, while others have not.At times I sleep, and while sleeping I meditate.When meditating while sleeping and sleeping,mental blindness shines forth as clear light.These instructions I have, while others have not.Once one understands well the view of the Mantrayana, and espe­cially that of Mahamudra, one will be able to meditate in connection with any form of conduct and any mental poison that arises. At the time when the mental poisons are extremely coarse, one will purify one's mental poisons by means of the mental poisons themselves. This is the principle of Mantrayana practice. One has to purify desire on the basis of one's desire, anger on the basis of one's anger, and so on. The term \"secret Mantrayana\" is used since it contains these deep and subtle methods of purification.Though, generally speaking, this is not the time to explain the se­cret Mantrayana, a short introduction is given here since the Shantong view leads up to the secret Mantrayana. The Mahayana Uttara Tantra, which itself belongs to the Sutrayana level of teaching, is a shastra building a bridge between sutra and tantra, since the views presented by the Shantong and Mantrayana systems are almost identical. On the basis of the essence of mind being the inseparable union of spa­ciousness and awareness, the ultimate nature of mind is explained as emptiness and bliss inseparable on the level of the secret Mantrayana. The aspect of clarity or clear light is experienced as bliss and the as­pect of spaciousness is identical to emptiness. Without viewing theExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 369"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"370 Buddha Naturemind as the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness the ex­perience of the inseparable union of emptiness and bliss will not arise. \"Inseparable\" means that the essence is undifferentiated and not able to be divided.Annotation 57:\"Calm abiding\" (Skt. samatha, Tib. zhi gnas) and \"special or vivid in­sight\" (Skt. vipasyand, Tib. lhag mthong) are defined as follows: \"Calm abiding\" means that all movements of the mind towards the outside are totally appeased or stilled and one abides one-pointedly focused on the virtuous or authentic object. \"Vivid insight\" means that within this state of calm abiding, or in other words, while the mind is free from thought, the authentic object is truly and individually discerned or analyzed. On the level of an ordinary being these two aspects of meditation are developed. This is not yet qualified special insight (Tib. lhag mthong mtshan nyid pa), which in the Mahayana tradition is de­fined as direct realization of emptiness. With this realization, quali­fied special insight arises in one's own stream of being. This is the path of seeing whereby one reaches the first bodhisattva level and goes beyond that of an ordinary being.The two benefits are benefit for oneself (Tib. rang don) and benefit for others (Tib. gzhan don). Through abandoning the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge without leaving a trace, one achieves final ultimate benefit for oneself, and final ultimate realization provides the benefit of others. Without the vision of supreme realiza­tion one is not able to truly benefit other sentient beings. \"Ultimate\" (Tib. mthar phyin pa) means that there is nothing beyond or further. The bodhisattvas who dwell on the ten bhumis, for instance, achieve their own benefit and that of others to a certain respective extent, but only a buddha embodies the final ultimate perfection of the two benefits. The same is true of nirvana, the state beyond the cycle of existence or be­yond torment and pain. A shravaka or pratyekabuddha arhat has only reached nirvana from the viewpoint of the coarse defilements being eliminated. Similarly, someone who attains the bodhisattva levels within the direct realization of emptiness has only gone beyond samsara from the viewpoint of this coarse level. With respect to the extremely subtle defilements, an arhat or a noble bodhisattva is not yet beyond the cycle of existence. In order to reach the ultimate nir­vana one must attain the state of buddhahood. As is said above in the"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"explanations of the tathagatagarbha (B.II.2.2.2.1.2.2. 8.2.3.2.2): \"One will therefore not attain nirvana without attaining the state of buddhahood.\"When it is said that a buddha teaches in accordance with the dis­ciples' streams of being, this means that he teaches in accordance with their different temperaments, aspirations, wishes, mental capacities, and dispositions.Annotation 58:When it is said that true buddhahood is of an uncompounded nature, this means that it is not compounded due to causes and conditions. The Tibetan term here translated as \"nature\" is chos can. It is widely used in the context of the teachings on valid cognition (see above, annota­tion 11) and its literal translation is \"that which has or is qualified by a property.\" Here the term chos can is to be understood as being equiva­lent to the Tibetan term rang bzhin, which means \"nature\" in the sense of something unable to be separated from a particular phenomenon.The nature of something compounded by causes and conditions can be understood, for instance, from the teachings on impermanence, where the samsaric condition is described as follows:All those who are born have the property of dying.All those who desire each other have the property of getting separated.All things that were gathered have the property of getting exhausted.We are born from causes and conditions and thus have the prop­erty of dying. Death cannot be separated from our nature and we will have to die sooner or later. Nevertheless, truly mastering the practice of the creation and completion phases of the Vajrayana, one can attain deathlessness. If one knows all appearances to be of mental nature, illusory manifestations of the mind, and thus realizes the meaning of the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness or of Maha­mudra, which is unborn clear light, one attains the power of becom­ing deathless. As Jetsiin Milarepa said in one of his songs to Pachig Dhampa Sangja:Within unborn mind there is supreme immortality.The characteristics of being born and dying are liberated of themselves.How happy I am in the firm vision of the highest view!Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 371"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"372 Buddha NatureGenerally speaking, first one needs to understand that everyone who is born is of the nature of dying. To think: \"I am still young and will not die as yet\" is of no benefit. One will surely die and it can happen any time. Yet, if one practices the sacred Dharma well, and especially if one manages to carry out the practices of the Vajrayana in the proper fashion, one can be liberated from death and go beyond dying. Padmasambhava, for instance, attained an immortal body, and the disciples of Milarepa known as \"the three sons and four daugh­ters,\" Rechungpa and so on, did not die. Their bodies became like rainbows and they departed into the pure fields. This is called \"the great transmigration in rainbow body\" (Tib. 'ja lus 'pho ba chen po). There were very many in Tibet who attained the kaya of great trans­migration in rainbow body. A person who departs from the world in this way will leave hair and fingernails behind, while his or her body will transform and become rainbow-like, thus vanishing from the earth. In order to achieve this, one does not have to be a very learned or important person. Anyone who receives the special oral instructions and puts them into practice as it should be can become a siddha (Tib. grub thob), an accomplished being.One should therefore apply the means to go beyond having the property of dying and to accomplish deathlessness, the kaya of im­mortality (Tib. 'chi mcd kyi sku). Only the Vajrayana holds these means, whereas the vehicle of characteristics (Tib. mtshan nyid kyi thegpa) does not. Nevertheless, one needs it as a basis. In the context of the vehicle of characteristics, or in the course of the second turning of the wheel of Dharma, the two truths and the meaning of their equality are pre­sented. If one does not understand this thoroughly, one will not un­derstand the meaning of purity and equality (Tib. dag pa dang mnyam pa'i don), which forms the basis of any Vajrayana practice. As long as this view is not understood well and is not truly adopted, the medita­tion on a deity, though it constitutes the heart of Vajrayana practice, will seem very easy and will become equally shallow. Any small child could do it, once he or she was taught what to visualize: \"Oh yes, there is a body with one head, two arms, and two legs, and there is also a flower in the left hand...\" With this approach one might won­der why the recognition of the absence of a personal self as taught in the Shravakayana is so much more difficult and why the Vajrayana is called \"secret.\" To be able to practice the Vajrayana one needs the ulti­mate view. This is the inseparable truth of purity and equality (Tib. dag mnyam bden pa dbyer med), meaning that all appearances that could"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"possibly occur are equal in their state of utter purity (Tib. dag pa rab 'byams). One needs to develop unshakable certainty that all phenom­ena are equally pure and inseparable in their nature of purity, since otherwise doubts will arise. One day one will meditate very well with pure faith, but the next day it will be gone and one will wonder what one is doing. In this way, one's diligence, discriminative wisdom, and faith will deteriorate. Once one has developed firm conviction of one's own inner view, there will be no doubt, and one's diligence, wisdom, and faith, not getting weakened, will ever increase and lead one to the state of a siddha. What this means can be seen from the biographies of saintly beings such as Tilo, Naro, Marpa, Mila, and so forth.In Tibet some among those who attained great transmigration in rainbow body mainly worked during their lives, as for instance cut­ting \"Om Mani Peme Hung\" in stones. The Vajrayana holds instruc­tions on how to combine work with meditation. Someone who really understands these deep instructions will manage to meditate while working and carrying out everyday activities. This is a sign that prac­tice is profound. Lacking profundity, one's meditation will go away while one is working, and while meditating one will not be able to engage in any kind of conduct. Yet, once one has acquired the neces­sary skill, both one's work and the innermost heart of Dharma will go well. One will benefit the truth, benefit sentient beings, and benefit oneself. In my view this aspect is especially important nowadays, as the manners and customs on this earth have changed. The way to ben­efit sentient beings best is not the same as it was at the time of the Buddha or of Jetsün Milarepa. When in those days a practitioner of Dharma renounced the world and stayed in the wilderness to medi­tate, people liked that very much and developed great faith. Thus this form of practice was extremely beneficial for other beings as well.The Buddha and his following of bhikshus, for instance, gave up all worldly activities. Yet, in order to communicate with people and to give them the opportunity to gather virtue, they went into the cities and begged for alms. Then the people, before eating themselves, would offer food to the Buddha and his many thousands of monks, and would dedicate their own food to Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. In this way their faith and supplications were greatly strengthened. At the time when Jetsün Milarepa appeared, people greatly admired anyone who withdrew into a cave to dedicate his life to meditation, and felt deep devotion towards such a person. Therefore, a single man such as Mila­repa, by meditating in the wilderness, would attract an extremely largeExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 373"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"374 Buddha Naturenumber of disciples who would follow his example, and there would be many sponsors who would joyfully sustain this lifestyle. Thus it was very good for everyone.Times have changed, though, and the present situation is different. When in our time someone decides to follow the ancient examples in the literal sense and gives up all work in order to meditate solely, he or she will be considered a very bad and useless person. One will be called \"work-shy\" or \"sluggard\" and no one will have respect, let alone any faith. Yet, if on the contrary one works very hard and efficiently in ev­eryday life, and at the same time manages to practice the Dharma, this is in my opinion very good for oneself and will become an equally good example to others. Working hard will increase one's own capacity of diligence, and being seen to combine work with the practice of Dharma will arouse faith in one's fellow beings. In this way one will manage to benefit others and oneself as well.With respect to the manners and customs of the world in these days, it is therefore extremely good to learn how to meditate while one is working. If there were no such instructions, this would be very diffi­cult. Nowadays many people think: \"In order to practice as the Buddha taught I have to give up all worldly activities. Since this is not pos­sible, I cannot practice Dharma. Therefore, a new style of Buddhism must be found.\" This is not true. The Buddha taught gradually in three turnings of the wheel of Dharma. Following the system of the Shravaka- yana, which belongs to the first turning of the wheel of Dharma, one has to abandon all worldly activities. In the teachings of the Great Vehicle, and especially in the context of the Mantrayana, the Buddha has taught how it is possible to practice while being engaged in any worldly activity. Thus we do not have to invent anything new, but are able to practice as the Buddha taught in our modem days as well.When it is said that buddhahood is equivalent to one's own benefit being finally perfected, one may wonder whether a buddha desires personal welfare and strives for this aim. There is no such intention. Even while being a bodhisattva, a buddha never had any egoistic mo­tives but solely strove to bring about the benefit of others. Yet in doing so one naturally achieves best possible benefit for oneself.When the text speaks of a saintly person with karmic fortune whose sense faculties have become supreme, this refers to a bodhisattva who has reached the bhumis.

In the state of an ordinary being, for in­stance, the eyes only perceive visible things but are shut to sound, and the nose only grasps smell but cannot experience taste or touch, and so on. On the path of seeing, though, the senses become utterly pure and the single sense-faculty of the eye can perceive all sensory objects at the same time. The consciousness behind the visual faculty of a bodhisattva is able to grasp every form, sound, odor, taste, and touch occurring in the ten directions simultaneously. This and many other qualities of the senses are attained once the first bhumi is reached.Annotation 59:When it is said that manifold sensory objects are perceived as being merely relative (Tib. kun nob tsam du) or merely nominal (Tib. tha snyad tsam du), this is to be understood as follows: The various appearances arising in a dream, for instance, such as visible things, sounds, odors, tastes, and different kinds of touch, are not really there. They only exist relatively or nominally. Yet when the mind is deluded during the dream phase, these merely relatively existent sense-objects will seem [to be] real and be perceived accordingly. When while dreaming one recognizes that one is dreaming, one will know that whatever one perceives is only a dream appearance and does not really exist. Still, as long as one does not wake up from sleep, appearances will arise, but to the perception of someone who recognizes them for what they are they will only have a relative or nominal existence. There will be the perception of mere appearance (Tib. snang tsam du). Similarly, in ultimate truth all phenomena are luminous emptiness free from any mental elaboration; nevertheless, appearance is there, but only in terms of mere appearance, in terms of something relative or nominal. We practice the Dharma in order to exhaust all impure appearances, all delusions of impurity. As long as we have not managed to do so, these impure appearances will be there. Once all delusion of impurity has been exhausted, everything will shine forth as pure physical form and the appearance of primordial wisdom (Tib. dag pa'i sku dang ye shes kyi snang bar shar ba). The way in which this actually takes place is very difficult to understand and people like us, lacking the actual realiza­tion, can only imagine it slightly through inference.When it is said that pure vision comes about through the power or on the basis of having previously gathered the accumulations, this refers to the time when one has followed the path of training and accumulatedExplanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gy am t so Rinpoche 375"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"376 Buddha Naturemerit in enacting the bodhisattva conduct. This power or ability will therefore be of different kinds.The elements are of four kinds: earth, water, fire, and air. \"Being made from the elements\" means that there are many phenomena in terms of visible things, sounds, odors, tastes, and different kinds of touch, all of which are made from or composed by these elements. As opposed to that, the form kayas are not made from the elements. They are not of the nature of these. The form kayas are the sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya, and one may wonder whether they are other than the dharmakaya. They are not, since the dharmakaya itself holds power or ability (Tib. nus pa), a multitude of qualities and types of activity.Generally speaking, \"a noble one\" (Tib. 'phags pa) is anyone who has transcended the level of an ordinary being. \"A great noble one\" is someone who has reached the pure bodhisattva levels—the eighth up to the tenth, inclusively. (See also Part Four, note 5.)Suppleness (Tib. shin sbyangs) means that both body and mind have become extremely malleable, so that during meditation one does not experience any physical discomfort no matter what hardships one undergoes in order to practice the Dharma, and the mind is able to meditate on any subject. When this is reached, one's meditation will go well, whereas until then one will feel physical pain and the body will not be spacious and relaxed. The mind will not keep its focus, but will wander and not rest evenly. Once one has attained physical and mental suppleness, one should not listen too much to other people regarding the proper way to meditate. Otherwise another fault would arise. When, unlike before, the body is continuously relaxed and spa­cious during meditation, and the mind has a strong aspect of lucidity, managing to meditate on anything without thinking, this is samadhi itself manifesting naturally and spontaneously (Tib. ting nge 'dzin de kar rang). Then one will attain the fruit of samadhi, which is the touch (Tib. reg bya) or experience of bliss arising from physical and mental malleability. This touch is not comparable to contact felt by the body. It is attained through samadhi and arises of its own force, so that body and mind are pervaded by bliss. This is not the same as the bliss prac­ticed in the Mantrayana, but is the bliss of shamatha or calm abiding. Once the mind is fully settled and abides unwaveringly, bliss will arise in body and mind.Generally speaking, this is a sign that the true nature of mind is the inseparable union of clarity and emptiness. When resting within this"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"inseparable union of clarity and emptiness, bliss will arise in the mind and by the power of this mental bliss the body will become blissful as well. Especially on the level of the secret Mantrayana, one needs this quality, since according to this system, realization is equivalent to the direct revelation or actualization of the inseparable union of empti­ness and bliss. Leading up to this view of bliss-emptiness inseparable is the view of the Shantong system, in which the final ultimate truth is the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness. If the final ulti­mate truth is considered as being merely empty, one will absorb one­self into a condition of total absence of thought and the mind will gain an according experience. In this state of just empty emptiness (Tib. stong pa stong kyang), no bliss will arise. By knowing the ultimate na­ture of the mind as being the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness, one will rest within this spaciousness and awareness in­separable during meditation, and when true samadhi is attained, mind and body will be filled with bliss. With this basis one will understand the view of the true nature of mind being jointly manifest bliss-empti­ness as taught in the Vajrayana or secret Mantrayana.The phrase \"the mode of the Dharma that is deep according to its own essence\" (Tib. rang gi ngo bo nyid kyis) means that it is by nature deep, as a butterlamp is by nature radiant.\"The intelligence that analyzes the absolute\" (Tib. don dam dpyod byed kyi rig pa) is equivalent to the intelligence or awareness analyzing emptiness. Mainly there are five kinds of intelligence, which are ana­lyzing the essence, the cause, the fruit, both cause and fruit, and mere appearance. They are called \"the Five Great Established Meanings\" (Tib. gtan thsigs chen po Inga). What is referred to here is the fifth, of which Jamgon Kongtriil the Great has said in his Treasury of Knowledge that analyzing or discerning mere appearance is the established mean­ing of interdependent origination (Tib. snang tsam la dpyod pa rten 'byung gi gtan thsigs) in that mere appearance is the appearance of interde­pendence. Elsewhere, in other traditions, the fifth aspect of awareness is also called \"the established meaning of the King of Awareness\" (Tib. rig pa'i rgyal po'i gtan thsigs).The term translated here as \"goodness\" is dge legs, which consists of the words \"virtue\" (dge ba) and \"definitive good\" (nges legs). This means that the Sugata provides benefit both temporarily and ulti­mately. Temporarily it is experienced as bliss, and ultimately it consti­tutes the cause through which one attains the fruit, the level of buddhahood.Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 377"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"378 Buddha NatureThe term dbang 'byor can also be explained as dbang po'i 'byor pa, which means \"the treasure or wealth of the senses.\" This refers to the fact that the sense faculties of a bodhisattva undergo a complete change of state once emptiness is seen directly, and thereby acquire a great multitude of qualities. As was said before, the single sense-faculty of the eye of a noble bodhisattva, for instance, can perceive all visible things, sounds, odors, tastes, and forms of touch simultaneously. These qualified senses are beyond the ordinary sense-faculties and the sense-objects they ex­perience are extremely subtle. The bodhisattvas who dwell on the ten bhumis perceive forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and contacts that are beyond the elements and all phenomena consisting of them. They appear through the power or creative ability of the dharmakaya. Thus the tathagata, though it is free from any reason generating a fruit, gen­erates all goodness, displaying the illusory appearance of mandalas, the reflection of the sambhogakaya, and teaching Dharma by means of signs and symbols. All these appearances are not made from the elements and are seen by noble bodhisattvas whose sense faculties have been transformed through the path of seeing.Annotation 60:Of the five paths, the first four, which are the paths of accumulation, junction, seeing, and meditation, constitute the path of training (Tib. slob lam). The fifth is the path of no more training (Tib. mi slob pa'i lam).The two aspects of ultimate abandonment and realization, which are presented here as the vimuktikaya (Tib. mam par grol ba'i sku, \"the body of complete liberation\") and the dharmakaya (Tib. chos sku, \"the body of qualities\") are also called the svabhavikakaya (Tib. ngo bo nyid kyi sku, \"the essence body\") and the jnana dharmakaya (Tib. ye shes chos kyi sku, \"the body of the quality of primordial wisdom\").When it is said that both the vimuktikaya and the dharmakaya are uncreated or uncompounded (Tib. 'dus ma byas), this means that they are not made from causes and conditions. Anything made from causes and conditions is a created or compounded phenomenon (Tib. 'du byed) and defined as follows:All compounded phenomena have the quality of being de­stroyed.All compounded phenomena have the quality of being imper­manent.All compounded phenomena have the quality of being unreli­able."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"In the terminology of the teachings on valid cognition, created and uncreated phenomena have two opposite characteristics: \"Being wont to arise, cease, and abide are the three characteristics of the created. Not being wont to arise, cease, and abide are the three characteristics of the uncreated\" (Tib. skye 'gaggnas gsum rung ba 'du byed kyi mtshan nyid/skye 'gaggnas gsum mi rung ba 'dus ma byas kyi mtshan nyid). Ulti­mately buddhahood is truly uncreated in that it is beyond both the extremes of createdness and uncreatedness. This is to be understood in the sense as, for instance, the dharmakaya is described as being \"true self\" in the section explaining the tathagatagarbha (B.H.2.2.2.1.2.2. 2.2.1.2): \"It is true self since all conceptual elaboration in terms of self and non-self is totally stilled.\" In the Shantong view, ultimate buddha­hood is already present in the state of the basis, and will reveal itself once all the pollution caused by the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge is abandoned without leaving a trace. If it was to be newly attained and arose from something created, there would be no reason for it to become uncreated later. Having to be newly attained, it would be compounded, and being compounded it would have the quality of being unreliable, impermanent, and subject to destruction. Viewed ultimately, though, buddha is no other than the nature of mind when purified from all the adventitious stains. The nature of mind being clarity-emptiness or space-awareness insepa­rable, nothing else or further needs to be achieved.Annotation 61:Meditative equipoise (Tib. snyoms 'jug) is equivalent to samadhi. The obstacles to samadhi are mainly of two kinds: agitation (Tib. rgod pa) and dullness (Tib. 'hying ba). The first means that the mind is scattered and wanders towards the outside, engaging, for instance, in thoughts about past, future, or present doings. Dullness means that the mind, though it is not distracted by outer objects but stays within, lacks the aspect of lucidity and its focus is not clear. Another fault is called rmugs pa in Tibetan, which might be translated as \"stupor,\" and is very simi­lar to dullness. It means that the mind is very dense and hazy. Since these are mental states, they are difficult to describe exactly.Annotation 62:The noble ones who have a wisdom body are those bodhisattvas who dwell on one of the three pure bhumis.

Claim­ing something that does not exist to be existent is an overstatement and claiming something that exists to be not existent is an understatement. If one said, for instance, that a human being has horns, this would be a [false] assertion, and if one said that a human being does not have two legs, this would be a [false] denial. Similarly, if one claimed that the mind was the power of flesh and blood, this would be an over­statement, since there are reasons to refute this assertion. The clear and aware essence of the mind could not arise from a gathering of flesh and blood. If, on the contrary, one claimed that the mind did not have intelligence, this would be an understatement, since the mind is able to understand many things even without requiring any study.A reasoner (Tib. rtogge pa) is someone who is very skilled in reason­ing and argumentation (Tib. rtog ge ba), which generally means es­tablishing or defining all phenomena by means of proofs and logical conclusions. Thus the insight derived from reasoning (Tib. rtogge ba'i rig pa) consists mainly of very good and pure thoughts. The dharma­dhatu is not an object for reasoning. Its nature of clarity has always been beyond the reach of any such thoughts. In order to realize it one has to meditate, as it is only to be experienced through the power of meditative equipoise. This marks a main difference between the Rangtong and Shantong systems. According to the Shantong view, anything defined by means of proofs and logical conclusions (Tib. rtags dang gtan thsigs) is the field of experience of thinking, to which the final ultimate meaning is not accessible at all. Whatever is able to be grasped by thought is part of the relative, which is self-empty in that it is empty according to its own essence (Tib. rang rang gis ngo bo'i stong pa) or empty of an existing essence. As such all aspects of the"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 381relative can be shown by means of logical reasoning. The ultimate object of experience, the true nature of mind, is empty of the adventi­tious stains that are other than it, but not empty of qualities that are native to it. It is spaciousness and awareness inseparable. This can neither be shown nor experienced by those means, but needs to be realized in yoga while dwelling evenly balanced within spaciousness- awareness itself. If one tried to establish the experience of clear light by means of logical reasoning, one would be immersed in thoughts. While thinking, there is no way to experience it. The true nature of mind is only to be realized through valid cognition in yoga (see above, annotation 56), which, arising from meditation, is free from mental elaboration and undeluded. When freedom from mental elaboration and from delusion has arisen, the ultimate truth reveals itself and be­comes immediately apparent.When it is said that a tathagata never rises from the dharmata, this means that the vision and understanding of the true state of every­thing is uninterruptedly present throughout all meditative and post- meditative phases.Annotation 65:The three methods of teaching employed by a supreme nirmanakaya can be understood from the way Buddha Shakyamuni trained his dis­ciples gradually. First he provided the means for a worldly being to gain access to the path of individual release resulting in the nirvana in terms of pacification of all suffering. Towards this aim he taught the Four Noble Truths, saying:Monks! One must understand suffering.One must abandon its origination.One must actualize its cessation and rely on the causal path.To those who had entered the path of release and generated firm con­viction with respect to the Dharma, he granted the teachings of the Great Vehicle in order to mature them thoroughly. In this context he started by giving instructions that were easy to understand, and then proceeded to ever profounder levels. In terms of the two emptinesses, for instance, he first explained the relative level from the viewpoint of self-emptiness, whereupon he elucidated the ultimate level as being spaciousness-awareness inseparable from the viewpoint of emptiness of other. Finally, in the course of the teachings pertaining to the secret Mantrayana, he expounded the unchanging realization of a buddha as being the realization of the utter purity of all appearances that could"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"382 Buddha Naturepossibly occur (Tib. snangsrid dag pa rab 'byams). He gave these teach­ings in many gradual stages, explaining the view, meditation, and ac­tion in the light of the Vajrayana system throughout four or six classes of tantras. Thus the Buddha taught in gradual stages, refining his in­structions ever further up to the most sublime level. To those who were ready he granted prophecy as to their future enlightenment, pre­dicting at what time, in what place, by what name and so forth they would reach buddhahood. This process can be compared to the way in which one cultivates a flower. First one will employ the means to make it grow, then the ones to make it ripen, and finally those to pre­vent it from decaying.Annotation 66:Self-awareness (Tib. rang rig) means that the duality of an object to be aware of and of an aware consciousness is not present (Tib. rig bya dang rig byed gnyis med pa). Through abiding within spaciousness- awareness inseparable itself, one frees oneself from the two veils along with their remaining imprints. When this freedom is achieved, there is individually discerning self-awareness, which is equivalent to ulti­mate direct realization in yoga.Annotation 67:When the union of means and discriminative wisdom (Tib. thabs dang shes rab zung du 'brel ba) is explained on the sutra level, means or method is equivalent to the practice of great compassion and so forth, and discriminative wisdom is equivalent to the wisdom realizing the non­existence of a self and so on. On the level of the Mantrayana it is to be understood as the joint manifestation of bliss and emptiness in that means is equivalent to great bliss and discriminative wisdom to emptiness.The Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit term \"yogi\" is \"naljorpa\" (rnal 'byor pa) and can be explained as follows. The word rnal ma is synonymous with the words gzhi and ngo thog, and thus means \"ba­sic, fundamental state\" or \"real, actual condition.\" The word 'byor ba, which means \"to stick or adhere to,\" is the intransitive form of sbyor ba, which means \"to fasten together\" or \"to apply.\" Rnal 'byor, or \"yoga\" as it is called in Sanskrit, is therefore generally defined as \"applying primordial wisdom to the meaning of the basic state\" (Tib. rnal ma'i don la ye shes sbyor ba); a rnal 'byor pa is someone who adheres to this application. The content of yoga in view and practice differs accord­ing to the progressive levels of the Buddha's teaching."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 383In the Sutra tradition, yoga is \"applying primordial wisdom to the meaning of the dharmata, which is the real condition of everything\" (Tib. rnal ma chos nyid kyi don la ye shes shy or ba).In the Rangtong system one has applied primordial wisdom to the meaning of the basic state when one has realized the meaning of free­dom from conceptual elaboration. This realization is reached once the nature of all phenomena is seen as their being empty of an existing essence, or literally speaking, self-empty according to their own es­sence (Tib. rnal ma chos thams cad rang bzhin rang rang ngo bos stong pa'i spros pa dang bral ba'i don rtogs pa).According to the Mahamudra tradition one applies primordial wis­dom to the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness itself (Tib. dbyings rig dbyer med kyi rang du ye shes sbyor ba). This means that primordial wisdom is no other than spaciousness-awareness insepa­rable. Apart from that there has never been any primordial wisdom. There is no external realizing subject that could be applied. Once one has gained the capacity of resting in this very union of spaciousness and awareness, it itself holds the power to appease all the adventi­tious veils.When one practices according to the tradition of the secret Mantra­yana, primordial wisdom is applied to the inseparable union of bliss and emptiness itself (Tib. bde stong byer med kyi rang du ye shes sbyor ba). This is done by applying primordial wisdom to the meaning of purity and equality being inseparable (Tib. dag mnyam byer med kyi don la ye shes sbyor ba) or by applying primordial wisdom from within the understanding of purity and equality (Tib. dag pa dang mnyam pa nyid kyi nang nas ye shes sbyor ba). For someone who has gained the realiza­tion of the unsurpassable ultimate view of the Mantrayana, there is not the slightest impurity. When people like us, who are bound to an understanding perceiving the truth of the relative, hear this statement, they will not believe their ears and it will not enter their minds. At our present stage we mainly experience the worldly deluded mind that perceives duality, having \"valid cognition\" based upon terms and names. Yet, when taking the dream as a basis of one's reflection, any impure appearance that may arise does not exist in terms of impure matter. Whatever is there while dreaming is spaciousness-awareness inseparable. If there was not the inseparable union of spaciousness and awareness, no dream could ever occur.Following the view of the highest tantra, one applies primordial wisdom to utter or universal purity (Tib. dag pa rob 'byams la ye shes sbyor ba), whereby one will eventually dwell within bliss-emptiness"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"384 Buddha Natureinseparable. This is the highest view and practice as it accords with the Annuttarayoga Tantra. Within the system of the Mantrayana the Buddha taught four classes of tantras: Kriya, Charya, Yoga, and Annuttara-yoga or Mahayoga Tantra. These are practiced gradually, and in their course view and meditation are refined ever further up to the ultimate level. In Kriya Tantra, for instance, there is the duality of purity and impurity and a lot of emphasis is given to creating purity in every respect. Nevertheless, when practicing the highest Tantra, the un­derstanding of the utter purity of all appearances that might possibly occur is indispensable. One has to apply primordial wisdom to this true state of everything. There is no such wisdom to be imported from elsewhere. The understanding of utter purity is the application of pri­mordial wisdom. When doing so, one is a yogi who will equally un­derstand and experience the inseparable union of bliss and emptiness. An ultimate yogi is a buddha.Annotation 68:The way in which a supreme nirmanakaya unfolds activity without moving from meditative equipoise within the dharmakaya can be il­lustrated by the modem example of television: a single person who is recorded in a studio will be seen by many people on a multitude of screens without this person moving away from the studio at all.Annotation 69:The three vehicles referred to here are the Shravakayana, Pratyeka- buddhayana, and Mahayana.Annotation 70:When the dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya are de­scribed as being permanent in terms of nature (Tib. rang bzhin gyi rtag pa), of uninterruptedness (Tib. rgyun mi 'chad pa'i rtag pa), and of con­tinuity (Tib. rgyun gyi rtag pa) respectively, this means the following: The dharmakaya has always been unchanging according to its own essence. The essence of the sambhogakaya is not permanence in terms of being unchanging but it uninterruptedly appears to the pure dis­ciples, the bodhisattvas dwelling on the ten bhumis. A supreme nirmanakaya cuts the stream of his physical existence, but from the time of having reached buddhahood onwards he will display mani­fold different illusory appearances as they are fit to train all sentient beings. Thus there is continuity of appearance."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"Explanations by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche 385Annotation 71:When it is said that the great enlightenment of a buddha does not consist of existence or peace (Tib. srid bzi ma bsdus pa), this means that it is not contained in samsara and nirvana, since the state of buddha­hood does not dwell in either of the extremes of existence and peace. Shravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats, for instance, have attained a state of mere peace and abide within this peace itself. When doing so, the continuity necessary to bring about the benefit of beings is cut. Thus their state consists of peace in terms of extinction. As opposed to that, a buddha neither adheres to existence nor peace. By means of great discriminative wisdom he knows the nature of existence as being free from arising and thus does not abide in samsara. At the same time, by means of great compassion, he brings about the benefit of beings and thus does not abide in a nirvana limited to pacification. Conduct car­ried out through the power and force of great compassion is like a magical illusion, and in the chapter on buddha activity is described as being free from any deliberate effort. To gain an impression, an ordi­nary being should reflect upon the question of how someone would act in a dream while realizing that he is dreaming. Buddha activity is conduct in terms of mere appearance.Annotation 72:According to the Shantong view the ultimate dharmakaya is to be understood as spaciousness and awareness inseparable, in which all illusory appearances along with their remaining imprints are totally uprooted and exhausted. The visible kayas are said to be relative, since they become an object of perception for the sense faculties of sentient beings. Anything perceived by the sense faculties of beings, such as forms, sounds, and so on, is a relative appearance. A buddha has to rely on these relative appearances in order to bring about the benefit of beings, since the ultimate truth, the total pacification of whatever illusion, is not a field of experience for the sense faculties. Thus a buddha benefits all sentient beings within the frame of their faculty of perception. He does so on the basis of the relative form kayas, which are the power or ability of the dharmakaya.Annotation 73:A supreme nirmanakaya in all his beautiful signs and marks is only seen by a sentient being who has purified the veil of negative karma, whereas to someone whose mind is still obscured by former very"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"386 Buddha Naturenegative actions he may appear in a very ordinary or even revulsive form, just as the clear reflection of the moon is only seen in unpolluted water.

Thus someone with the shravaka disposition, for instance, would not grasp the Buddha's words when he gave the instructions pertaining to the second or third turnings of the Wheel of Dharma. For this reason the followers of the Shravakayana and Pratyekabuddhayana claim that the Mahayana and Vajrayana teachings do not originate from the Buddha.Annotation 79:In the Madhyamakavatara (Tib. dbu ma la 'jugpa) by Chandrakirti, three types of compassion (Tib. snying rje) are described: compassion focus­ing on sentient beings (Tib. sems can la dmigs pa'i snying rje), compas­sion focusing on the nature (Tib. chos la dmigs pa'i snying rje), and com­passion free from focus (Tib. dmigs pa med pa'i snying rje). The first type is compassion as it is developed by an ordinary being. It still goes along with the perception of duality and with attachment in terms of the belief that sentient beings truly exist. The second type is com­passion that arises in recognition of their impermanent nature, while the third type is the compassion of a noble bodhisattva who has real­ized that sentient beings do not truly exist. All these three types of compassion, however, are given rise to by means of progressively sub­tler thoughts. As opposed to that, the great compassion (Tib. thugs rje chen po) of a buddha manifests without any thought or deliberate ef­fort, since upon reaching buddhahood one undergoes a complete trans­formation of state (Tib. gnas yongs su gyur pa).Annotation 80:A buddha is the ground of everything that is best within the world and beyond it, since he has given the teachings of the three vehicles— the Shravakayana, Pratyekabuddhayana, and Mahayana. The latter again divides into the vehicle of characteristics and into the secret Mantrayana, which offers innumerable individual paths to liberation. If one practices these teachings, one will attain the best possible achievement within the world and beyond it. If, for instance, one medi­tates on patience as it accords with the Buddha's words and cultivates this practice, one will temporarily achieve the happiness consisting of the appeasement of anger and hatred. Ultimately one will attain the level of a perfect buddha, as patience is one of the six perfections, which will lead one beyond one's ordinary perception and thoughts. Thus, through the power of practicing one teaching of the Buddha, such as patience, one will attain the best possible goodness in the world and beyond.

Likewise, if following the Mahayana tradition one has cultivated love and compassion, and resulting from that has devel­oped a genuinely benevolent heart towards all sentient beings, one will be convinced of the truth of the Buddha's words and will take them to heart in their entirety. Thus one will temporarily harvest hap­piness through the practice of virtue, through everything beneficial for oneself and all others, and ultimately achieve the level of buddhahood.The best possible goodness to be achieved within the desire realm is mainly a very agreeable and pure sensation through the five doors of sense-perception, which comes about through the practice of virtue. Bad and hurtful visible form, sound, smell, taste, and touch are the main obstacles for a being of the desire realm to experience the good­ness it can provide. The causes for the best possible achievement within the realm of form are the four levels of meditative stability and the four immeasurable contemplations—the cultivation of limitless love, compassion, joy, and equanimity. When one has developed the latter four, one will attain a rebirth comparable to that of Brahma, the lord of the gods. The best possible achievement within the formless realm consists of the modes of resting evenly in meditative equipoise. These are the experiences of boundless space (Tib. nam mkha'mtha'yas skye melted), of boundless consciousness (Tib. mam shes mtha' yas skye mched), of nothingness itself (Tib. ci yang med pa'i skye melted), and of conscious non-conscious intuition (Tib.

As to a general explanation, all phenomena that become an object of thought are included in the term \"general characteristic.\" The appearance of every form, sound, smell, taste, and touch that is unmixed with thought and yet experienced as other than oneself is the intrinsic characteristic (Tib. rang mtshan) of a thing.

They do not have the slightest faith, modesty, or compas­sion, and they do not feel the slightest remorse. [The term \"cut-off disposition\" is used as it refers to sentient beings who are totally cut off or estranged from their true nature, not feeling its basic goodness, warmth, and light at all.](2) Those with the uncertain disposition depend upon conditions: When they rely on a spiritual friend who is a shravaka, or have friends who are shravakas, or see the shravaka sutras and thereupon develop faith in the shravaka view, their disposition turns into the shravaka disposition and they themselves really become shravakas. This is equally true when they rely on a spiritual friend who is a pratyeka­buddha, etc., or when they rely on a spiritual friend who is a follower of the Mahayana, etc.(3) Those with the shravaka disposition are characterized by the fact that they are afraid of samsara, that they have faith in the quality of nirvana, that they strive for its attainment, and that they have but little compassion.(4) Those with the pratyekabuddha disposition have the following six characteristics: They are afraid of samsara. They have faith in the quality of nirvana and strive to attain it. They have but little compas­sion. They are very proud. They keep their teacher secret and delight in dwelling in solitude.(5) The disposition to the Mahayana is thoroughly presented by means of the following six points, which are (a) types, (b) essence, (c) synonyms, (d) the reason why it surpasses the other dispositions, (e) manifestation, and (f) signs.(a) The disposition to the Mahayana is of two types, these being the naturally present disposition and the disposition accomplished through correct cultivation.Translator's Notes 393"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"394 Buddha Nature(b) The essence of the naturally present disposition consists of the fact that it constitutes the power giving rise to the buddha qualities, that it has been present within beings since beginningless time, and that all sentient beings have attained it in terms of their true state.The essence of the disposition accomplished through correct culti­vation consists of the fact that it constitutes the power giving rise to the buddha qualities, that it unfolds through the former practice of the roots of virtue, and that it is the cause of the sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya.(c) Synonyms of the term \"disposition\" are the terms \"seed,\" \"ele­ment,\" \"nature,\" and \"essence.\"(d) The reason why it surpasses the other dispositions: The two dis­positions to become a shravaka or a pratyekabuddha are lesser, since they turn into a completely purified disposition by the mere purifica­tion of the veil of the mental poisons. The disposition to the Mahayana is most excellent, since it turns into a completely purified disposition through the purification of both the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge.(e) The disposition to the Mahayana has two ways of manifesta­tion, which are the awakened and the unawakened disposition. In the case of the awakened disposition, the actual manifestation of the fruit is present and the signs are apparent. In the case of the unawakened disposition the actual manifestation of the fruit is not present and the signs are not apparent.There are four conditions obstructing the awakening of the disposi­tion. These are a birth in unfavorable circumstances, the non-presence of remaining imprints, the entertainment of wrong views, and the fault that consists of the presence of the veils.There are two conditions conducive to the awakening of the dispo­sition: an outer and an inner. The outer condition is the fact that the sacred Dharma is taught, and the inner condition is conceptual activ­ity that corresponds to reality or truth.(f) The signs of the disposition to the Mahayana, or in other words, the signs of a bodhisattva, are the following: Body, speech, and mind are naturally gentle without there being the need of applying an anti­dote. Deceit and hypocrisy are very minute and there is love for sen­tient beings. Love for sentient beings is the primary sign of a bodhi­sattva.The above explanations are taken from the chapter \"The Cause is the Sugatagarbha\" of the text Jewel Ornament of Liberation (Tib. dam chos yid bzhin nor bu thar pa rin po chei rgyan) by the Noble Gampopa."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Translator's Notes 395There are three English translations of this work: Herbert Guenther, The Jewel Ornament of Liberation (London: Rider & Company, 1959); Ken and Katia Holmes, Gems of Dharma, Jewels of Freedom (Forres: Altea, 1995); and Khenpo Konchog Gyaltsen Rinpoche The Jewel Ornament of Liberation (Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications, 1998).Note 2:For further information on non-Buddhist tenets see, for example, Hopkins, Meditation on Emptiness, pp. 186,317-333.Note 3:Generally speaking the term \"demon\" (Skt. mdra, Tib. bdnd) refers to various difficulties and obstacles met by a person who endeavors to practice the teachings of the Buddha. The \"four demons\" are the de­mon of the skandhas (Skt. skandha-mdra, Tib. phung po'i bdud), the de­mon of the mental poisons (Skt. klesa-mdra, Tib. nyon mongs pa'i bdud), the demon of the lord of death (Skt. mrtyu-mdra, Tib. 'chi bdag gi bdud), and the demon of the divine child (Skt. devaputra-mara, Tib. lha'i bu'i bdud). The first consists of the fact that one mistakenly believes the five skandhas to be an existing self. The second consists of the fact that one is overcome and steered by the mental poisons. The third represents death, which interrupts one's practice of Dharma unless one has learned how to make the process of dying a part of it. The fourth represents the seduction that can be induced by the bliss expe­rienced during meditation, as long as one is still on the level of the god realms within samsara.Note 4:(1) The five skandhas or aggregates (Tib. phung po) are forms (Skt. rupa, Tib. gzugs), feelings (Skt. vedana, Tib. tshor ba), discriminations (Skt. samjhd, Tib. 'du shes), compositional factors (Skt. samskdra, Tib. 'du byed), and consciousnesses (Skt. vijhdna, Tib. mam shes).(2) The eighteen elements or constituents (Skt. dhdtu, Tib. khams) consist of the six sense-objects, the six sense-faculties, and the six sense- consciousnesses.The six sense-objects are forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangible ob­jects, and phenomena.The six sense-faculties are the eye sense-faculty, the ear sense-faculty, the nose sense-faculty, the tongue sense-faculty, the body sense-faculty, and the mind sense-faculty."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"396 Buddha NatureThe six sense-consciousnesses are the eye-consciousness, the ear- consciousness, the nose-consciousness, the tongue-consciousness, the body-consciousness, and the mental consciousness.(3) The twelve entrances or sources (Skt. dyatana, Tib. skye mched) consist of the six sense-objects and the six sense-faculties, as mentioned above.(For further information see, for example, Hopkins, Meditation on Emptiness, p. 271-274.)Note 5:On one hand the ten bodhisattva levels (Skt. bhumi, Tib. byang chub sems dpa'i sa bcu) are related to the ten perfections (Skt. pdramitd, Tib. pha rot tu phyin pa), which are successively accomplished while one travels these levels. On the other hand they are related to the gradual process of purification during which the two veils of the mental poi­sons and hindrances to knowledge are eliminated. They are called:(1) Supremely Joyful(2) Stainless(3) Luminous(4) Radiant(5) Very Difficult to Overcome(6) Directly Manifest(7) Gone Afar(8) Immovable(9) Excellent Understanding (10) Cloud of Dharma.These names can be explained as follows:(1) The first bodhisattva level corresponds to the path of seeing. It is called \"Supremely Joyful\" since it is on the path of seeing that for the first time the nature of mind is realized directly and as it is. This realization is not just an experience, but is lasting and will not fade. It contains the certainty of henceforth wielding the ability to be of true benefit to all fellow beings. The dawning of this certainty is accompa­nied by great joy. The path of seeing, through which the first bodhi­sattva level is reached, contains the far-reaching transformation of an ordinary being into a bodhisattva. At this level the perfection of giv­ing is achieved.(2) On the second bodhisattva level, ethics reach their perfection. Through this attainment the conduct of a bodhisattva who dwells on"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Translator's Notes 397this level has become utterly pure. Since there are no faults of behav­iors whatsoever, the second bhumi is called \"the Stainless.\"(3) \"Luminous,\" the name of the third bodhisattva level, refers to an experience arising to a bodhisattva who dwells on this level dur­ing the post-meditative phase. At this time a copper-colored glow is seen, which is due to the fact that primordial wisdom shines through the phenomena perceived. In the system of the Sutrayana this experi­ence is not developed, whereas in the Vajrayana system it is cultivated until gradually the streams of rainbow-colored light in which the dei­ties appear are seen. On the third bodhisattva level the perfection of patience is achieved.(4) The fourth bodhisattva level is called \"the Radiant,\" since at this stage the copper-colored light, which is seen for the first time on the third bodhisattva level, gains an extraordinary intensity. The Sutrayana system of teachings does not contain any further explanation, whereas in the Vajrayana teachings this light is described extensively in terms of ten stages covering all the colors of the rainbow. On the fourth bhumi diligence is perfected.(5) On the fifth bodhisattva level the perfection of meditative sta­bility is attained. Its name \"Very Difficult to Overcome\" can be ex­plained in two ways. On one hand it is difficult to purify the veils that obscure the nature of the mind at this point. On the other hand it is difficult to incite the disciples' effort towards serious discipline and practice.(6) The sixth bodhisattva level is called \"Directly Manifest\" since a bodhisattva who dwells on this level has gained the ability of directly seeing the illusory nature of samsara. Samsara and nirvana are seen to be one and the same. There is no longer the slightest difference between them. On the sixth bodhisattva level discriminative wisdom reaches perfection.(7) \"Gone Afar,\" the name of the seventh bodhisattva level, can also be explained from two angles. On one hand it refers to the fact that the seventh bodhisattva level represents a state of development higher than that of a shravaka or pratyekabuddha arhat. When the Buddha sends forth light rays from his forehead to awaken these arhats from the state of extinction in which they abide, thus causing them to gain access to the Mahayana path, they take up this path at the beginning of the sev­enth bodhisattva level. On the other hand the name refers to the fact that during the seventh bodhisattva level the conceptual elaboration consisting of the perception of characteristics is completely abandoned,"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"398 Buddha Natureand that a bodhisattva on this level goes beyond this obscuration. On the seventh bhumi the perfection of means is achieved.(8) The eighth bodhisattva level is called \"the Immovable\" since a bodhisattva who dwells on this level is neither shaken by the concept that thoughts are present nor by the concept that no thoughts are present. On the eighth bhumi the perfection of wishing prayers is accomplished.(9) The ninth bodhisattva level is called \"Excellent Understanding\" since a bodhisattva who dwells on this level has gained the capacity of seeing all phenomena that are objects of knowledge, as well as their true state, in an all-embracing way. On the ninth level power is perfected.(10) The name of the tenth bodhisattva level is \"Cloud of Dharma\" since a bodhisattva who dwells on this level conveys the sacred Dharma to beings in a way that is spontaneous and free from any deliberate effort. This is similar to the sky in which rain clouds gather and release their abundant waters spontaneously and without effort onto the earth, where the rain provides for a good harvest. On the tenth bodhisattva level the perfection of primordial wisdom is achieved.The ten bodhisattva levels represent progressive stages of purifica­tion from the two veils, which are the veils of the mental poisons and hindrances to knowledge.(1) The two veils are defined as follows:(a) The veil of the mental poisons (Skt. klesdvarana, Tib. nyon mongs pa'i sgrib pa) consists of the primary mental poisons, which are desire, hatred, and mental blindness, and of the secondary defilements stem­ming from these. The literal meaning of the Tibetan term nyon mongs is \"affliction.\" This term is used since the arising of the mental poi­sons causes suffering and torment to the mind. The way in which the mental poisons arise can be illustrated by the example of dreaming. Suppose one dreams of friends and enemies. A dream has a nature that is illusory and the dream-appearances do not truly exist. In spite of this, desire and aversion will arise when facing a friend and an enemy respectively, as long as one does not recognize that one is dream­ing. This example shows that it is the affliction of ignorance that con­stitutes the cause for the arising of all the other mental poisons.The three primary mental poisons are eliminated by means of the following methods: Ignorance is abandoned by means of discrimina­tive wisdom realizing the non-existence of a self. Aversion and hatred are eliminated by means of love and compassion. With regard to the abandonment of desire, different methods are used within the systems"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Translator's Notes 399of the three vehicles. When following the shravaka path, desire is elimi­nated by means of its antidote. This is the meditation on revulsive­ness, in the course of which one absorbs oneself into the fact that ob­jects, which appear to be pleasant and are therefore desired, are in truth revulsive and thus undesirable. In the system of the path of the Mahayana, desire is abandoned by referring it back to emptiness and thus transforming it into this emptiness. Within the system of the Vajra- yana desire itself is made use of as the means to overcome it.(b) The veil of the hindrances to knowledge (Skt. jheydvarana, Tib. shes bya'i sgrib pa) consists mainly of the fixation resulting from the fact that the so-called three circles or complexes, that is, subject, ob­ject, and their interaction, are taken to be truly existent. A subtler as­pect of the veil of the hindrances to knowledge consists of the fixation upon characteristics. This is to say, a perception that is freed from the belief in true existence is present, but it conceptually identifies an ob­ject of perception by means of its characteristics, which are simulta­neously labelled by a name. The subtlest aspect of the veil of the hin­drances to knowledge is called \"the appearance of duality as such.\" This means perception is no longer ruled by the belief in the true ex­istence of the perceived object nor by the concepts of its characteris­tics, but identifies a mere \"appearance as two\" (Tib. gnyis su snang ba). These three types of hindrances to knowledge can also be illustrated by means of the example of dreaming. Suppose one dreams of giving a gift to somebody else. As long as one does not recognize that one is dreaming, one takes oneself (the giver), the other person (the receiver of the gift), and the action of giving to be truly existent. This action is virtuous since it springs from a good motivation. It cannot be said to be utterly pure, though, since the belief in the true existence of sub­ject, object, and their interaction obscures the way of existence of these three aspects, which is the fact that they are empty of an existing es­sence. As soon as one recognizes that one is dreaming, the belief in the true existence of the giver, the receiver, and the action of giving is no longer present. What is present in the state of this realization is merely the perception of the appearance of these aspects, the characteristics of which are identified by a name. They appear as relative phenom­ena and are realized for what they are, as something empty by its very essence. Once the fixation on the conceptualized characteristics of phe­nomena is abandoned as well, there is nothing more than a mere \"ap­pearance as two,\" which is completely free from any further ideation.(2) The relation of the ten bodhisattva levels to the gradual removal of the veils is as follows: All beings who have not realized the way of"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"400 Buddha Natureexistence of phenomena, who have not realized that phenomena are empty according to their essence, are infested by the fixation consisting of the belief in their true existence. This fixation is eliminated by di­rect realization of emptiness. Through this realization, by which the veil of the mental poisons and the coarse aspect of the veil of the hin­drances to knowledge are removed, an ordinary being reaches the first bodhisattva level and becomes a noble bodhisattva. From the first up to the seventh bodhisattva level inclusively, the belief in the true exist­ence of phenomena is no longer present. What is present is the subtler aspect of the fixation upon characteristics. For this reason these stages are also called the \"impure bodhisattva levels.\" From the eighth up to the tenth bodhisattva level inclusively, the fixation upon characteris­tics is also overcome and no longer present. At this stage there is merely the appearance of duality as such, not accompanied by any fixation or concept. The last three are therefore called \"the pure bodhisattva lev­els.\" At the time when a bodhisattva leaves the tenth bodhisattva level, this subtlest aspect of the veil of the hindrances to knowledge is also eliminated and the state of buddhahood is reached. This implies com­plete freedom from any concept whatsoever. It is the state of a tathagata, a vast and open space, which is by essence empty and by nature clear light in a completely indivisible way.The division into the ten bodhisattva levels is therefore only due to a respective degree of purification from the two veils. With regard to the nature of mind itself, which has been utterly pure since beginning- less time, there are no different stages. This nature of mind is always the same, just as, for instance, the new moon and the full moon are equally the moon, and there is no difference between these as far as the moon itself is concerned.(The above is a rendering of oral teachings by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche. They were given while he explained the Jewel Ornament of Liberation by Jetsiin Gampopa in the spring of 1978, in La Poujade, France, and in the course of his explanations of this present text in the summer of 1979 in Karma Zopa Ling, Langwedel, Germany.

Thus it is complete mastery of meditation.(3) Mastery of necessaries is the capacity to cause an immeasurable rain of precious goods to fall onto beings.(4) Mastery of karma is the capacity to transform the karma of other beings. A bodhisattva who has reached the tenth bodhisattva level is able to transform negative karma, the result of which would have to be experienced in a certain realm, in a certain place, as a certain being, as a certain type of birth, and at a certain time, into another karma that will result in a rebirth in the higher realms of existence.(5) Mastery of birth means that such a bodhisattva is able to take birth in the realm of desire without leaving the state of meditative stability in which he is dwelling and without this state suffering the slightest deterioration. Although he is bom there, he is not polluted by its faults.(6) Mastery of intentions is the capacity to transform earth and so on into water and so on, just as one wishes.(7) Mastery of wishing prayers is the capacity to utter wishing prayers that bring about the best possible benefit of others and to ac­complish the fulfillment of these prayers.(8) Mastery of miraculous powers is the capacity to demonstrate powerful miracles in order to awaken aspiration towards the Dharma in beings.(9) Mastery of primordial wisdom is supreme and ultimate knowl­edge with respect to all phenomena, to their meaning and definition, and with respect to one's own courage. The former means that a bodhi­sattva who dwells on the tenth bodhisattva level knows the absolute and the relative truths. The latter refers to his capacity of fearlessly teaching the Dharma in every aspect and to any assembly.(10) Mastery of Dharma means that a bodhisattva who has reached the tenth bodhisattva level is able to transmit the teachings of the sutras and so forth to all sentient beings by using the linguistic instruments, such as words, terms, names, and so on, in such a way that in manner and amount they correspond exactly to the respective mental capacity"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"of each individual being.

That is whatever genuine experience has dawned within one's own stream of being through practicing the actual meaning of the words of the Buddha, through cultivating the qualities resulting from the three trainings and from the developing and perfecting stages [of the Vajrayana system], respectively.(The above is taken from Clarifying Suchness: A Fool's Note on the Developing and the Perfecting Stages [Tib. bskyed rdzogs kyi zin bris bluti gtam de nyid gsal ba bzhugs so] by Dzogchenpa Shonnu Yeshe Dorje, who is also known by the name Do Khyentse Rinpoche.)Note 8:Karma Thrinlapa lived in the late fifteenth/early sixteenth century and was an eminent teacher belonging to the Sakya school.

The four kinds of mindfulness are cultivated on the small path of accumulation. They consist of the meditations on imper­manence, suffering, emptiness, and on the fact that one's own body, thoughts, emotions, and the other inner phenomena do not exist as a self. A bodhisattva would extend his or her meditation to embrace the bodies, thoughts, and so forth of all other beings as well.(2) The second section consists of the four aspects of thorough aban­donment (Skt. samyakprahdna, Tib. yang dag par spong ba bzhi): aban­doning mental poisons that have already arisen, not giving rise to mental poisons that have not yet arisen, generating pure dharmas that have not yet been generated, and increasing pure dharmas that have"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"already been generated. The four kinds of thorough abandonment are cultivated on the middling path of accumulation. They are called \"thor­ough\" since their practice is suited to lead one to buddhahood, pro­vided they are supplemented by the aspiration of wanting to reach supreme enlightenment in order to become able to benefit all sentient beings. The development of pure dharmas or virtues is also called an \"abandonment,\" since in order to develop any virtue its respective contrary needs to be abandoned.(3) The third section consists of the four supports of miraculous powers (Skt. rddhipada, Tib. rdzu 'phrul gyi rkangpa bzhi), which are the samadhis of longing (Skt. chanda, Tib. dun pa), of diligence (Skt. virya, Tib. brtson 'grus), of intention (Skt. citta, Tib. sems), and of discrimina­tion (Skt. mimdmsa, Tib. dpyod pa). They are called \"supports\" since they are the prerequisites for a manifestation coming about miracu­lously. They are cultivated on the great path of accumulation.(4) The fourth section consists of the five capacities (Skt. indriya, Tib. dbang po Inga), which are faith (Skt. sraddhd, Tib. dad pa), diligence (Skt. virya, Tib. brtson 'grus), mindfulness (Skt. smrti, Tib. dran pa), samadhi (Tib. ting nge 'dzin), and discriminative wisdom (Skt. prajhd, Tib. shes rab). They are attained on the levels \"heat\" and \"peak\" of the path of junction.(5) The fifth section consists of the five powers (Skt. bala, Tib. stobs Inga), which are faith, diligence, mindfulness, samadhi, and discrimi­native wisdom (see above) as they are attained on the levels \"forbear­ance\" and \"highest mundane dharma\" of the path of junction.(6) The sixth section consists of the seven branches of enlighten­ment (Skt. bodhyahga, Tib. byang chub kyi yan lag bdun), which are mind­fulness (Skt. smrti, Tib. dran pa), discrimination of phenomena (Skt. dharmapravicaya, Tib. chos mam par 'byed pa yang dag), diligence (Skt. virya, Tib. brtson 'grus), joy (Skt. priti, Tib. dga' ba yang dag), suppleness (Skt. prasrabhdi, Tib. shin tu sbyangs pa yang dag), samadhi (Tib. ting nge 'dzin), and equanimity (Skt. upeksa, Tib. btang snyoms yang dag). These are accomplished on the path of seeing.(7) The seventh section consists of the noble eightfold path (Skt. dryamdrgdhga, Tib. 'phags pa'i lam yan lag brgyad) the branches of which are right view (Skt. samyagdrsti, Tib. yang dag pa'i Ita ba), right thought (Skt. samyaksamkalpa, Tib. yang dag pa'i rtog pa), right speech (Skt. samyagvac, Tib. yang dag pa'i ngag), right action (Skt. samyakkarmdnta, Tib. yang dag pa'i las kyi mtha'), right livelihood (Skt. samyagdjiva, Tib.404 Buddha Nature"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"Translators Notes 405yang dag pa'i tsho ba), right effort (Skt. samyagvydydma, Tib. yang dag pa'i rtsol ba), right mindfulness (Skt. samyaksmrti, Tib. yang dag pa'i dran pa), and right concentration (Skt. samyaksamddhi, Tib. yang dag pa'i ting nge 'dzin). They are attained on the path of meditation.When arhathood is reached, all the thirty-seven dharmas condu­cive to enlightenment are accomplished.(The above is taken from the eighteenth chapter of the Jewel Orna­ment of Liberation [Tib. dam chos yid bzhin nor bu thar pa rin po che'i rgyan] by the Noble Gampopa, teaching the five paths. For further informa­tion see, for example, Hopkins, Meditation on Emptiness, pp. 205,206).Note 11:As a general guideline for a practitioner to take to heart, the Buddha advised that one should rely on four principles rather than upon four others. This advice is as follows:Rather than on the words rely on the meaning.Rather than on personalities rely on Dharma.Rather than on any relative truth rely on the ultimate truth.Rather than on the provisional rely on the definitive meaning.As for the last statement there are, generally speaking, two ways in which the Buddha taught and in which his teachings are therefore presented. The first is called \"neyartha\" in Sanskrit (Tib. drang don), which can be translated as \"provisional meaning\" or \"meaning re­quiring interpretation.\" This refers to teachings that are given for a specific purpose and are not identical to truth itself: they are meant to lead one gradually to the understanding of the actual truth. This does not mean that these teachings are false. They are true but not totally so. They are valid to a certain extent and on the relative level. One might call them a half-truth that will guide one into truth as it actually is. The Buddha has described these teachings by means of the follow­ing example:Suppose there is a house with many children inside and this house is abundantly filled with all kinds of beautiful toys and very attractive pleasurable things. Then you suddenly see that the house has caught fire and will go up in flames any time. So you call the children: \"Come out! Come out! Quickly! The house is burning!\" Yet, being so immersed in their toys and pleasures they will not listen. All these playthings are far too exciting to be left behind and the children do not realize the danger. Therefore you have to decoy them arid shout: \"There are so"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"406 Buddha Naturemany wonderful toys out here, much more and far nicer ones than in the house! You should come outside and have a look!\" Hearing that, the children become curious and run from the house. There may not be any toys outside but the children are saved from the fire!This illustrates what is to be understood by the teachings conveying the provisional meaning: in a way one is not telling the full truth, but this is done for a purpose that otherwise would not be achieved. Then again it cannot be said to be totally untrue. One may not have any toys out there but it is possible to find and provide some later. Since the children did not die, they are still able to play. If they had died, there would be no other chance for them to enjoy any toy. A statement that was not totally truthful at the time saved their lives and thus pro­vided a future opportunity. For this reason it is called a provisional truth. All the teachings expressing the relative level are contained in this aspect. The second is called \"nitartha\" in Sanskrit (Tib. nges don). This can be translated as \"definitive meaning.\" It refers to those teach­ings that directly express the truth, the ultimate level, the way every­thing really is.(The above is an explanation by Ringu Tulku Rinpoche, as given 1997 in Theksum Tashi Choling, Hamburg.)Note 12:Rahu (Tib. sgra gcan) is the name of a planet that, according to Chinese and Brahminical astrology, exercises malignant influences on the des­tinies of mankind. It is especially known for its being at enmity with the sun and the moon on which it takes continuous vengeance by swallowing them and thus causing eclipses.Note 13:The four essentials of partnership (Tib. bsdu ba'i dngos po bzhi) are: giv­ing the necessities of life (Tib. mkho ba sbyin pa), speaking in an agree­able and conciliatory way (Tib. snyan par smra ba), acting in accordance with the manners and customs of the world (Tib. 'jig rten don mthun pa), and fulfilling the benefit of the disciples (Tib. gdul bya'i don la spyod pa).Note 14:Generally speaking, ten sciences (Tib. riggnas bcu) are distinguished of which five are higher and five are minor. The latter are the sciences of healing or medicine (Tib. gso ba rig pa), of words or language (Tib. sgra rig pa), of valid cognition (Tib. tshad ma rig pa), of dialectics (Tib."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"Translator's Notes 407gtan tshig rig pa), and of mechanical crafts (Tib. bzo rig pa). The five higher sciences referred to here consist of the knowledge of the inner meaning of the three pitakas (Tib. nang don sde snod gsum rig pa). The three pitakas are the vinayapitaka, the abhidharmapitaka, and the sutrapitaka; these comprise all the teachings of the Buddha."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"DedicationMay the merit resulting from the work with this text contribute in the greatest possible measure to the temporary and ultimate welfare of all sentient beings."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"PHILOSOPHY/RELIGION/TIBETAN BUDDHISMAll sentient beings, without exception, have buddha nature, the inherent purity and perfection of the mind, untouched by changing mental states.The Mahayana Uttaratantra Shastra, one of the \"Five Treatises\" said to have been dictated to Asanga by the Bodhisattva Maitreya, presents the Buddha's definitive teachings on how we should understand this ground of enlightenment and clarifies the nature and qualities of buddhahood. This seminal text details with great clarity the view which forms the basis for Vajrayana, and especially Mahamudra, practice.
