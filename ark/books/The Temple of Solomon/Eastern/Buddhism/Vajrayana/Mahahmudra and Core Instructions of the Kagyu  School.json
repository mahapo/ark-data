As evidenced from the historical writings, this flowering of Buddhist tradi­tion in the country brought about the fulfillment of the deep spiritual aspi­rations of countless sentient beings. In particular, it contributed to the inner peace and tranquility of the peoples of Tibet, Outer Mongolia-a country historically suffused with Tibetan Buddhism and its culture-the T uva and Kalmuk regions in present-day Russia, the outer regions of mainland China, and the entire trans-Himalayan areas on the southern side, including Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh, Kinnaur, and Spiti. Today this tradition of Buddhism has the potential to make significant contributions to the welfare of the entire human family. I have no doubt that, when combined with the methods and insights of modern science, the Tibetan Buddhist cultural heritage and knowledge will help foster a more enlightened and compassionate human society, a humanity that is at peace with itself, with fellow sentient beings, and with the natural world at large. It is for this reason I am delighted that the Institute of Tibetan Classics in Montreal, Canada, is compiling a thirty-two-volume series containing the works of many great Tibetan teachers, philosophers, scholars, and practitio­ners representing all major Tibetan schools and traditions. These important writings will be critically edited and annotated and will then be published in modern book format in a reference collection called The Library of Tibetan Classics, with their translations into other major languages to follow later.

Today, I am happy to see this special anthology of Dakpo Kagyii texts published in English translation as part of The Library of Tibetan Classics, a series envisioned by Thupten Jinpa, the principal English translator to His Holiness the Four­teenth Dalai Lama. These teachings are intended to create experiences and realizations in the mind. They contain two kinds of instructions: those that engage with the essential points of the body and those that engage with the essential points of the mind. Engaging with the essential points of the body is accomplished through the stationary channels, the moving winds, and so on. These instructions for attaining buddhahood are the path of methods, which is comprised of the six Dharmas of Naropa, such as caQ.<;iali and the illusory body. The teach­ings of the six Dharmas are based upon the Guhyasamaja, Mahamaya, Heva­jra, Cakrasa111vara, and Four Seats tantras. These six Dharmas constitute the ultimate completion-stage practice for all highest yoga tantras, especially the nondual tantras. The instructions..for attaining buddhahood in one lifetime and in one body through engaging with the essential points of the mind are the path of liberation, which is comprised of the profound mahamudra instructions. The teachings on mahamudra explain that there is no stain whatsoever to be removed from the luminous nature of the mind and no additional quality that needs to be created in it. There are both sutra and tantra traditions of mahamudra. The former is meditation on luminosity free from conceptual elaboration, while the tantra tradition's mahamudra is the accomplishment of the unity of bliss and emptiness. The Dakpo Kagyii tradition is an unin­terrupted lineage-sustained until the present-of the stainless realization of mahamudra.

This volume, Mahamudra and Related Instructions: Core Teachings of the Kagyu Schools, which is volumes of The Library of Tibetan Classics, brings into the world's literary heritage a collection of a very special genre of spiritual writ­ings of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Compiled by the Most Venerable Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, a senior master of the Kagyii school, the texts featured in this anthology present the heart of the meditative tradition of the Kagyii school. Distilled in these translations are the insights and instructions of the Tibetan spiritual lineage of such great luminaries as Marpa Lotsawa, Milarepa, and Gampopa, a school that is acclaimed for its profound and rich meditative practices. It is with both joy and honor that the Institute of Tibetan Classics offers the translation of these precious Tibetan texts to the contemporary reader, especially to those who seek to engage deeply with the Tibetan tradition and its wisdom. Two primary objectives have driven the creation and development of The Library of Tibetan Classics. The first aim is to help revitalize the apprecia­tion and the study of the Tibetan classical heritage within Tibetan-speaking communities worldwide. The younger generation in particular struggle with the tension between traditional Tibetan culture and the realities of mod­ern consumerism. To this end, efforts have been made to develop a compre­hensive yet manageable body of texts, one that features the works of Tibet's best-known authors and covers the gamut of classical Tibetan knowledge. The second objective of The Library of Tibetan Classics is to help make these texts part of global literary and intellectual heritage. In this regard, we have tried to make the English translation reader-friendly and, as much as possi­ble, keep the body of the text free of unnecessary scholarly apparatus, which can intimidate general readers.

The texts in this thirty-two-volume: series span more than a millennium­from the development of the Tibetan script in the seventh century to the first pan of the twentieth century. when Tibetan society and culture first encountered industrial modernity. The volumes are thematically organized and cover many of the categories of classical Tibetan knowledge-from the teachings specific to each Tibetan school ro the classical works on philoso­phy, psychology, and phenomenology. The first category includes teachings of the Kadam, Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyii, Geluk, and Jonang schools, of mis­cellaneous Buddhist lineages, and of the Bon school. Te xts in these volumes have been largely selected by senior lineage holders of the individual schools. Te xts in the other categories have been selected primarily in recognition of the historical reality of the individual disciplines. For example, in the field of epistemology, works from the Sakya and Geluk schools have been selected, while the volume on buddha nature fe atures the writings ofButon Rinchen Drop and various Kagyii masters. Where fields are of more common inter­est, such as the three codes or the bodhisattva ideal, efforts have been made to represent the perspectives of all fo ur major Tibetan Buddhist schools. The Library of Tibetan Classics can function as a comprehensive library of the Tibetan literary heritage fo r libraries, educational and cultural institutions, and interested individuals. It has been a profound honor fo r me to be part of this important trans­lation project. I wish first of all to express my deep personal gratitude to H.

Buddhism had been introduced into Tibet four centuries ear­lier under royal auspices, and the schools that originated later were known as Sarma, \"new:' to distinguish them from the Ny ingma, or \"old;' tradition. Among the numerous Tibetan translators and teachers of that time, the Kagyii meditator Milarepa is perhaps the most famous, and his biography and songs remain popular today. Three feature films have even been made about him recently-in India, Bhutan, and Tibet. His life of simplicity and austerity completely dedicated to meditation is a touchstone for a school that emphasizes meditation practice over scholarship. He is the peerless exemplar of reaching buddhahood in a single lifetime through only guru devotion and dedication to meditation, without any formal studies. Nevertheless, although the Kagyii is based upon the teachings of a non­monastic meditator, it became a monastic tradition in the twelfth century through the efforts of Milarepa's pupil, Gampopa, the first author repre­sented in this compilation. Since Gampopa's founding of the first Kagyii monastery, the Kagyii tradition has seen a proliferation of subschools, most of which now have a limited or minimal existence. The Karma Kagyii, now the most popular Kagyii tradition in both Eastern countries and in the West, originated with a pupil of Gampopa who became, retrospectively, the First Karmapa, and the Karmapa lineage was the first line of transmis­sion in Tibet based on identifying the reincarnation of its principal lama. Various Kagyii factions competed for secular rule of Tibet via the Phak­modru and Rinpung dynasties beginning in the fourteenth century, and by the sixteenth century the Karma Kagyi.i school dominated Central Tibet. 1 It was eclipsed by the rise to power of the Fifth Dalai Lama in the middle of the seventeenth century, but it continued to have a strong following in the eastern regions of the Tibetan plateau. Another one of our authors,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"1 l\\-f,tbdmudrd .md Related lmtmctiom the eighteenth-century Karma Kagyii hierarch Situ Tenpai Nyinje, built Palpung Monastery in the eastern kingdom ofDerge with royal patronage, and although Tsurphu Monastery in Central Tibet was the official center for the Karma Kagyii, Palpung became the most important of its monas­teries as a result of the teaching and meditation practice that took place there. Situ Tenpai Nyinje's successor, the Ninth Tai Situ, established the tra­dition of the three-year retreats, in which the deities Cakrasarpvara and Vajravarahi in particular are practiced and the six Dharmas of Naropa may be mastered. These practices together with mahamudra meditation repre­sent the ancient core of advanced Kagyii practice. In the last few decades hundreds of Westerners have accomplished the Kagyii three-year retreats in centers established in Europe and North America. Every Kagyii monastery of note has a khenpo, who is the head of scholastic studies, and a monastic col­lege called a shedra, in which there is an intensive program of study for many years. But the heart of the Kagyii monastery is in its retreat centers, where one finds not only shedra graduates but also monks who become lamas with­out undergoing intensive scholastic training. Palpung was also the seat of the polymath Jamgon Kongtriil (1813-99 ), the nonsectarian author and editor of numerous volumes that have had enor­mous impact in both the study and practice of the Karma Kagyii.2 Because of the Kagyii emphasis on meditation over scholarship, the Kagyii lineage before Jamgon Kongtriil did not have an extensive literature. The literature that did exist is well represented by the works included in the present vol­ume, teachings in which study is clearly unified with, and at the service of, meditation practice. Ka gyu Origins The Kagyii tradition inherited the higher yoga tantric tradition that had become widespread in northern India in the closing centuries of the first millennium, particularly those tantras known as the yogini tantras or, more commonly in Tibet, the mother tantras. This esoteric Buddhism was quite different from the Buddhism that was preserved in the Pali Canon. Trans­formed by the Mahayana ideal, Buddhist philosophical scholasticism, and tantra's antinomian ism, the Indian Buddhism inherited by the Kagyii school had undergone an astonishing process of evolution and assimilation since the lifetime of Siddhartha Gautama in the fifth century B.C.E."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Trtlnslator:( Introduction � The Buddha himself did not found his religion in a vacuum; he had assim­ilated and transformed the religious traditions he was born into, including the very titles buddha and muni, the Brhadtirtt1J.Yttka Upani$ad's champion­ing of the nontraditional practice of abandoning the lay life at a young age in order to overcome ignorance and attain liberation frorn Jamsara (itself a pre­Buddhist term), and the lifestyle of a shaven-headed renunciate with yellow robes known as a bhik$u, already a venerable tradition. Nevertheless, the Buddha's teachings were revolutionary in many aspects, and they proved also a fertile ground for later development of views and prac­tices. Buddhist canonical literature enlarged to many times its original size as accomplished masters received, through meditation and vision, sutras and tantras that had not been previously divulged into the human world. This diverse and remarkable evolution and often bewilderingly rich array of teach­ings culminated in the Indian siddhas, practitioners of the mother tantras. Their views, practices, and conduct may seem far removed from those of the founder of their religion, yet they retained the essence of the original liberat­ing message. This combination of both continuity and innovation within this ancient tradition-now almost a thousand years since the first beginnings of the Kagyii tradition in Tibet and two and a half millennia since the Buddha's lifetime-are clearly testified in the teachings compiled in this book. The Kagyii school is one of seven religious traditions of Tibetan Bud­dhism that continue today as independent organizations; the other six are the Nyingma, Bon, Sakya, Geluk, Jonang, and Bodong.3 Of the antecedents to the Tibetan schools in India, there is no precedent in terms of exclusive institutions, for in India the transmissions of Buddhist practices were pri­marily between individual gurus and their personal pupils and not specif­ically identified with formal organizations such as the great monasteries.-� These large sectarian organizations encompassing a variety of transmission lineages became more solidified in Tibet once secular rule became the prov­ince of religious institutions headed by reincarnate lamas, and lineages vied with one another not just for adherents but for political influence and the resources of the state. The term Kagyii as the name of a school is said to have originated as a shortened form of kabap shiyi gyu, which means the \"lineage of four instruction transmissions.\"s This refers to the teachings compiled by the tenth-century Bengali now generally known as Tilopa (these four trans­missions are discussed in the next section). Tilopa's Indian pupil, Naropa, became the teacher of the Tibetan translator and tantric master Marpa"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 Mahtimudrti and Related Instructions Chokyi Lodro, who in the eleventh century introduced many of Naropa's teachings into Tibet. All Kagyii schools, extant and extinct, trace their origin to Marpa Chokyi Lodro, and therefore Marpa Kagyii is sometimes used as a generic term for ali Kagyii lineages. Marpa in turn became the teacher of Milarepa. Of the more than fifteen Kagyii lineages that have appeared since the elev­enth century, those that currently survive as major independent schools are the Karma Kagyii, Drukpa Kagyii, and Drigung Kagyii. The Barom Kagyii has over a dozen monasteries in Golok, a region in the northeast of the Tibetan plateau, and most of the other lineages have a small but continuing existence. There are also the Surmang Kagyii and Nedo Kagyii, though they in prac­tice function as a subschool within the Karma Kagyii.6 The Shangpa Kagyii is technically a distinct, separate lineage from the Marpa Kagyii traditions. Nev­ertheless, while it can be classified as a school in its own right, it is currently primarily preserved as a lineage of practices within the Karma Kagyii tradi­tion. Volume 8 in this series will feature teachings of the Shangpa school. .Khcnchen Thrangu Rinpoche, the principal scholar in the Karma Kagyii tradition, chose the eleven texts that comprise this volume. This volume therefore primarily represents a Karma Kagyii perspective and usage, with five texts from authors of importance within that lineage. The Dakpo Kagyii is a general term for all the lineages that derive from Gampopa, also known as Dakpo Lhajc, but also refers to his own specific lineage. This lineage is represented by a compilation of lcctures by Gampopa himself and by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, the abbot of Gampopa's monastery four centuries later. The works of both authors arc studied in the Karma Kagyii as well. The Drukpa Kagyii is represented by a short mahamudra text by Perna Karpo that is none­theless used tor instruction by Karma Kagyii teachers. The Drigung Kagyu is represented by Shcrap JungnC's Sing/� Virwpoint and three associated texts, which codify the viewpoints ofJikten Sumgon, the founder of the Drigung lineage. Two texts from the Tsal� Kagyii. a lineage that no longer exists, arc also included. These Drigung and Tsalpa Kagyu texts arc induded within Jamgon Kongtriil's TrtAsury oflnstruaions.

Kambala's instructions on dreams (svapna) 4· Sukhasiddhi's instructions on the bardo (antardbhava )8 and transfer­ence of consciousness into another body (purapraveia )9 Tilopa briefly described these six practices in a short verse text entitled Instructions on the Six Dharmas.10 In Tibet these practices became known as the six Dharmas of Ndropa. In English they became known as the six yogas of Naropa through their being first translated in 1935 by Evans-Wentz in Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, even though Evans-Wentz only referred to them as \"six doctrines,\" which is the equivalent of six Dharmas.11 The term yoga (sbyor ba) is never used for this set of practices in Tibetan, and they should not be confused with the Kalacakra tradition's group of six practices that are called yogas. The six Dharmas of Naropa are intended solely for advanced practitioners and are normally taught within a three-year retreat. In this volume they are the subject of Shamar Chokyi Wangchuk's text, the Quintessence of Nectar. They are also described in Dakpo Tashi Namgyal's overview of the tantras, Light Rays from the Jewel of the Excellent Teaching.12 Many teachings and practices of the Kagyii school, however, originally came from other Tibetan schools. The monastic Kagyii practitioner follows a tradition of ordination derived from the Kadam tradition, which formed in the eleventh century based on the teachings of the Indian pai)Qita Atisa (982-1054), who spent his final years in Tibet. Kagyii scholastic studies have origins in both the Kadam and other traditions. For example, the dis­tinctive empty of other (gzhan stong) philosophy13 that is particularly pro­pounded within the Karma Kagyii is derived from the Jonang school. The Jonang also provided the Kalacakra practices. Mind training (blo skyong) and White Tara come from the Kadampas, and the severance (gcod) practices come from the lineage of that name. Practices of deities such as Green Tara. Avalokitcsvara, Vajrakilaya, and various guru yogas ofPadmasambhava were introduced from the Nyingma school. Some Nyingma tertiins (who by vari­ous methods reveal or discover Ierma: teachings, ritual objects. and relics). such as Jatson Nyingpo (•sHs-r6s6) and Yongc Mingyur Dorjc (1628/ .. p-1708 ), were closely affiliated with the Kagyii. ·1 he term�\\ of NJnKh<) l\\lin­gyur Dor;e ( 164-s-67 ), whkh tc)rm rhc basis of ch\"· Palyul Nyin�ma lineo.tgc."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"also supplied the Kagyi.i with such deity practices as Amitabha and Bhai�ajya Guru (Medicine Buddha). There are also terma from within the Kagyi.i tradition itself. For exam­ple, the founder of the Drukpa Kagyi.i school, Tsangpa Gyare (u6I-I2.II), revealed a terma concealed by Rechungpa, one of the Kagyi.i's earliest mas­ters, that became of central importance to the lineage. Of great importance in the Drigung Kagyii school are the termas ofRinchen Phi.intsok (IS09-S7) and Drigung Ni.iden Dorje (I8oi-S9). Thus, although the Kagyi.i identity is that of a lineage of instructions descended from Marpa Chokyi Lodro, the majority of common Kagyi.i prac­tices are derived from other lineages. Much of Marpa's own transmission, such as Mahamaya and Buddhakapala, have fallen into disuse and are only nominally maintained as a ritual transmission of their empowerments. Cer­tain higher tantra practices introduced by Marpa, however, continue to be the central practices for advanced Kagyi.i practitioners and form the main part of the traditional three-year retreats. The Quintessential Kag.yu Practices The advanced higher tantra practices that do derive from Marpa-and that could therefore be said to form the core of the Kagyii identity-appeared in India between the eighth and tenth centuries. They were among a small group of tantras that have been variously named yogini tantras, mother tan tras, hi gh er yoga (yogottara) tantras, and none-higher or unsurpassable yoga (yoganu tta ra ) tantras, which in English are usually referred to as the highest yoga tantras.1� For the Kagyii, the most important of these are the Cakrasarpvara tantras. It is taught that the deity Cakrasa.rpvara originates from a Heruka who defeated Siva and assumed his form, retinues, and sacred sites. He is a blue deity in sexual union with the red goddess Vajravarahi. The original Indian tantric texts play only a small role in contemporary Kagyii study and practice, as advanced Kagyii practitioners of Cakrasarpvara or Vajravarahi focus primarily on meditation texts of Tibetan origin. For the Karma Kagyii, Vajravarahi is the principal deity, holding Cakrasarpvara in the form of a kha tvanga scepter in the crook of her arm.1s According to the Tibetan view, the practices derived from the higher tan­tras are classified into two groups-the stage of gen eration and the stage of completion .16 The generation stage entails the visualization of oneself as the deity within a divine palace. The deity is called the yi dam, or \"commitment"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"TranJlator's In troduction 7 deity;' in Tibetan and iftadevatd, or \"chosen deity,\" in Sanskrit. The prac­tice consists primarily of mantra repetition and a variety of chants, offerings, and visualizations. The practitioner's habituation to the \"pure perception\" of the deity and the environs is intended to eliminate habituation to ordi­nary perception and reveal the intrinsic purity of all mental and physical phenomena.1:-The Kagyii school divides the completion stage into two kinds of practice: the path of methods and the path of liberation. The path of methods consists especially of the six Dharmas of Naropa mentioned above, and the path of liberation is primarily the practice of mahamudra, the main subject of the present volume. The Six Dharmas oJNdropa The principal practice among the six Dharmas of Naropa is ca1J4ali. The pri­mary, though not exclusive, Tibetan word for this practice is tumo (gtum mo ), which literally means a \"fierce or savage woman.\" The Sanskrit ca1J4ali or candalika also conveys the meaning of \"hot\"-as in a hot, wild, passionate woman. In particular, it was the name for the female of the most impure of the untouchables: the ca.Q.Qalas. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, during his seventh-century visit to India, recorded how ca.Q.Qalas were obliged to make noises to warn villages that they were passing through so that the inhabit­ants could hide indoors and avoid being polluted. It is indicative of the anti­nomian tendency of the highest yoga tantras that these and other female untouchables, deemed the lowest of human beings, were sought out as con­sorts in sexual yoga and were deified in such practices as Hevajra, where a Ca.Q.Qali appears in that deity's entourage. Heat was that goddess's specialty: She could burn up the universe, incinerating all impurities that prevent the realization of innate buddhahood. Ca.Q.Qali has become known in the West as \"inner heat\" because of the physical heat generation attributed to the practice. However, the goal of the practice is not heat but rather the experience of bliss and emptiness. Ca.Q.c;lali is based upon an esoteric physiology, consisting of a network of channels (nd{ii) that pervade the body, through which move wind ( vd_yu) and in which are located \"drops\" (hindu). These drops can have various forms and may be solid or liquid, semen itself being an example. Though details of this mor­phology vary, generally the three most important channels are the central channel (avadhii.ti), which runs parallel to the spine, and two secondary"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8 Mahdmudrd ,znd Related Instructions channels that run parallel to its left and right: the ra san d and the /a /a nd. The breath enters the left and right channels through the two nostrils. As the mind and the winds are interdependent, the mind can be made to reach a nondual state through making the winds of the left and right channels enter the central channel at the abdomen. Therefore, breath-retention practices are employed to cause this to occur and thus give rise to the nondual state. The cat:t<;iali practice also involves the physiology of sexuality, generally described from a male perspective. It corresponds with far more ancient Taoist practices, which have a greater number of pressure points in breath control, called jade locks, and a specific female morphology that has the retention of menstruation as the parallel to the male retention of ejacula­tion. Cat:t<;iali and the cakra system appeared in the Buddhist tradition sub­sequent to a period of Buddhist and Taoist coexistence in Central Asia. The ca kras, literally \"wheels,\" are the points where subsidiary channels branch off into the body, but they were unknown in India before the latter centu­ries of the first millennium, when they first appeared in both Saivism and Buddhism. In all these traditions, semen, which in Buddhist tantra is euphemistically called bodhicitta , is located in the skull at the top of the central channel. In cat:t4ali, as during sexual arousal, a flame at the navel causes the bodhicitta to melt and descend as liquid, creating stages of bliss as it passes through four cakras at the throat, heart, navel, and genitals. In this practice, the bodhi­citta is not ejaculated but drawn back up the central channel, creating four more stages ofbliss during which the practitioner realizes the essential nature of the mind. Cal)Qali is termed liberation through the upper door in con­trast to sexual practice with an imagined or real consort (an \"action seal;' or kannamudrti) , which is called bliss through the lo wer door. A more advanced form of this consort practice involves the semen exiting, blending with the female fluid, and then being drawn back into the body and up through the cakras. This sexual practice was sometimes counted as one of the six Dhar­mas, and it is described in Dakpo Tashi Namgyal's text within this volume. Briefly, the other five practices are illusory body, which develops a percep­tion of all phenomena as an illusion; dream yoga to gain an awareness and control of dreams; lu minosity, or more literally from the Sanskrit \"bright­ness,\" which involves maintaining awareness on entering dreamless sleep; tran sference, in which one trains in firing one's consciousness out through the crown of the head at the time of death in order to attain enlightenment, or at least a good rebirth; and the bardo, which is practiced in order to attain"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Tr,lnslator's Introduction 9 enlightenment, or a good rebirth, in the state between death and rebirth. Although the number six has remained constant since the introduction of the six Dharmas into Tibet, there was considerable variation in the earlier centuries as to what practices made up that number. The practices enumer­ated were sotnetimes more than six, with two practices being classed as one. The present-day list is similar to that given by Tilopa, althoughpurapraveia, the practice of transferring one's consciousness into a dead body and reani­mating it, has been replaced by the less-dramatic companion practice of transference (sarrtkranti), known in Tibetan and popularly in the West as phowa, in which the consciousness at death is sent into a yidam deity and thereby a pure realm. In Tilopa's instructions this was presented as only one fo rm of purapravesa. Purapraveia literally means \"entering a town\" but is also called, less obscurely, \"entering another's body\" (parakayapraveia ). In this practice the consciousness is transferred into a dead (yet healthy) young body, which is then reanimated. This enables the practitioner to avoid the process of rebirth and childhood disrupting the continuum of consciousness and memory. Though there is a popular legend that the transmission of this practice ended with the death of Marpa's son Darma Do de, there are a num­ber of instances in the biographies of medieval Kagyii masters, where they display their mastery of this practice by briefly reanimating a dead animal or bird while in meditation. In any period, however, accounts of permanently abandoning one's body and continuing one's life in another body are rare. An ancillary to caQ<;lali practice briefly referred to in this volume is the set of distinctive and exacting exercises called yantra ( 'khrul khor), which include jumping and landing in the vajra posture, wherein the fe et rest on the opposite thighs, so as to eliminate defects in the flow of wind through the channels. Mahdmudrd in India Mahamudra is a comparatively simple, direct approach to seeing the nature of the mind, though the teaching also includes many stages fo r an initial sta­bilization of the mind. Six of the eleven texts in the present volume are dedi­cated to explicating the practice of mahamudra.1� It is not easy to determine what historical kernel survives within Tibetan biographies of Indian masters. However, the Tibetan tradition has the mahamudra teachings commence with Saraha and his doha verses. Saraha is depicted to be the great-grandteacher of Maitripa, and therefore would be active in the early tenth century if taken in normal hmnan terms, though"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10 Mahamudra and Related Instructions little in their biographies is normal. Saraha's teacher is said to be the bodhi­sattva Rarnamati, a tenth-level bodhisattva in Akanigha, the ultimate realm of the dharmakaya buddha Vajradhara. Therefore Saraha is the first human teacher in this lineage. 19 The doha is the literary medium most closely associated with the mahamudra teachings and was used by successive generations of siddhas from the last centuries of the first millennium onward. However, the mean­ing of the word doha was lost in Tibetan translation. A doha is in fact a par­ticular form of rhyming couplets. Famous examples of dohas are the Hindi poetry ofKabir (1440-1518), in which each doha could be an independent separate work. Indian poetry employed various kinds of verse and meters based on patterns of long and short syllables, unlike Tibetan, which counts only the number of syllables per line. As there is no Tibetan equivalent for the word doha, it has often simply been transcribed rather than translated. However, the general word for a spiritual song in Tibetan is mgur, and the dohas and a related type of verse called caryapadas written in the earliest form of Bengali arc generally referred to in Tibetan as mgur. This has led to an inaccurate back translation of all instances of mgur in Tibetan, including native Tibetan songs, as doha, glossed as \"a song expressing realization.\" The language in which these dohas were written was not Sanskrit but usu­ally a late middle-In die language such as Apabhraqtsa. The very word doh a is not Sanskrit; do means \"two\" and is related to the Sanskrit dva. Saraha's dohas were written in an eastern form of Apabhra.rpsa and appear to actu­aJly be a collection of couplets by various authors. Their distinctive rhyming sound pattern is lost in both Tibetan and English translation.

Savaripa, who is described to be a pupil of both Saraha and Nagarjuna, is said to have been one of the tribal peoples in what is now Orissa. He is said to have lived as a hunter in the fo rests, and in one description of how Savaripa first appeared to Maitripa, he is wearing a peacock-feather skirt and is attended by two tribal women, who are picking lice fro1n his hair. We enter surer historical fo oting with Maitripa (986-1o63)/0 who became the principal master of mahamudra in India. He was a pupil of Naropa fo r twenty years and is said to have started teaching in his fifties. His hermitage appears to have been in Mithila (also known as Tirhut), an area that now cor­responds to northern Bihar and neighboring parts of southern Nepal. The Introduction ofMahdmudrd into Tibet Atisa received mahamudra instruction from Maitripa, which must have been before 1040, the year of both Naropa's death and Atisa's departure fo r Tibet via Nepal. He arrived in Tibet in 1042, where he stayed until his death twelve years later at age seventy-two. He taught mahamudra to his pupil Dromton (1004-63), but Dromton decided against making mahamudra a part of the Kadam tradition, fe aring it would have a negative influence on conduct.21 The mahamudra lineage of Marpa Chokyi Lodro, even though he was a pupil of Maitripa and the ostensible fo under of the Kagyii tradition, is classed as the subsidiary translation tradition (zur gyur), because initially other mahamudra transmissions, many of which originated with VajrapaQ.i (b. 1017 ),22 were of greater importance. Dampa Kor Niriipa (1o62-1102) was a Tibetan who held yet another mahamudra lineage. After a curious case of the practice of purapravesa, Dampa Kor, as he was originally called, became known as Kor Niriipa. A practitioner and traveler to Nepal from an early age, Dampa Kor is said to have died there when he was nineteen. Staying in the same house with him was seventy-three-year-old Niriipa, a pupil of Maitripa's disciple Karopa. Niriipa performed the practice of purapravefa and entered Dampa Kor's body and revived it. After Niriipa's old body was cremated, he went to Tibet in the young Tibetan body but wearing Indian clothing and with the con­joined name of Kor Niriipa. He then changed to wearing Tibetan clothing and taught mahamudra there fo r twenty-one years, dying at age forty, this time in the more conventional manner."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"I! ,\\f,th.imudr.i .md Rd.zted Imtmdiom Following these earliest transmissions of mahamudra there came what are called the middle tmmmissions, in which VajrapaQi plays a crucial role. VajrapaQi is known as one of \"the four great pupils of Maitripa.\" The other three were Natekara (also known as Sahajavajra), Devakaracandra (also known as Siinyatasamadhi), and Ramapala. VajrapaQi moved to Lalitpur (nowadays named Patan, in the Kathmandu Valley) in 1066. In 1074. when he would have been fifty-seven, he was known among Tibetans as one of the three great masters in Nepal/3 the other two being Pamthingpa and Bharo Chakdum.H One account describes him as a white-haired pa.Q.Qita who liked to give sugarcane to Tibetans and enjoyed getting them drunk.25 Vajrap:i.Q.i went to Tibet with his Kashmiri pupil, Dharma.Sri, and gave many teachings in the Tsang region of Central Tibet. He had numer­ous Tibetan pupils and assisted in the translation of nearly forty texts. He authored eleven texts that are preserved in the Tibetan canon. He is absent from a list of great masters in the 1o8os, so it seems he had passed away by that time. The lineage of his teachings is called the upp er or western mahamudra tradition to differentiate it from two other mahamudra traditions, the lo wer and la ter mahamudra. The lower or easte rn mahamudra began with Vajrapa.Q.i's pupil, a Nepalese brahman generally known as Asu. 26 Asu is said to have been passing through Tibet on pilgrimage to China when he married a Tibetan woman and settled down in the Phenyiil area of Central Tibet. Asu had many pupils and estab­lished a family line of mahamudra through two of his four sons. Asu taught mahamudra to Milarepa's pupil Rechungpa (Io84-1161), who also studied with Ramapala, one of Maitripa's four principal pupils, and with Tipupa, one ofMaitripa's seven \"middle-ranking\" pupils.27 Rechungpa introduced various teachings into Tibet, even transmitting them to his own teacher, Milarepa. Rechungpa's transmission is central to the Drukpa Kagyii school, which originated with Lingrepa, who was at one time a practitioner within Rechungpa's nonmonastic lineage. The la ter tradition of mahamudra comes from Nakpo Sherde, a pupil of Vajrap:i.Q.i in Nepal during the master's last years. He focused in particular on the do has of Saraha. Mahamudra instructions were also introduced into Tibet in the twelfth century. Vairocanarak�ita, a paQQita originally from South India, stud­ied in northern India under a number of masters, the most famous being Abhayakaragupta (d.

He translate� many mahamudra do has and teachings, including those ofMaitripa. His pupils in Tibet are said to have included Lama Shang ( 1123-93), one of this volume's authors.2q The Blue Annals also state that he taught the eleventh-century Dampa Kor as a child, but that appears to be a confla­tion with another teacher .. \\0 Tilopa The traditional dates fo r Tilopa (also written in the Tibetan texts as Te lopa, Ta ilopa, or Tillipa), whose fo rmal name was Prajnabhadra, are earth ox to earth bird, which would have to be 928-1009. In narratives ofhis life, Tilopa is described as a solitary dark-skinned wanderer with bulging eyes and long, matted hair. He is said to have been a monk who gave up the monastic life to live a tantric lifestyle, during which he chained himself into the meditation posture fo r twelve years. He subsequently became a sesame seed (til) grinder, which is said to be the origin of his name. He is also said to have worked as a procurer fo r a prostitute. All who knew him were astounded when he levi­tated \"to the height of seven palm trees\" and sang one of his spiritual songs. Tilopa is depicted as having Vaj radhara, the symbol of the dharmakaya, as his guru. A song attributed to Tilopa, though it is not included in the canonical works, even claims he had no human guru, contradicting the his­tory of fo ur transmissions mentioned above. This discrepancy is sometimes explained as Vajradhara having given only the blessing, while the instructions came fr om his human teachers. Another explanation is that Tilopa was Vajra­dhara, and his studying with gurus was an act performed merely to benefit others. The legends of Tilopa also have him receiving certain instructions fr om c;lakinis in their realm, named Oc;lc;liyana. Ndropa The earliest known surviving biographies of Naropa are those written by Gampopa and Lama Shang, two of the authors represented in this volume.31 They describe how Naropa underwent a series of hardships under Tilopa, such as leaping off a temple roof, lying on a leech-infested mire, receiving savage beatings after stealing fo od, sexually assaulting a"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"14 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions bride during her procession, and attempting to kidnap a queen. Obey­ing Tilopa's commands brought him each time to the point of death, and he was only revived by Tilopa's miraculous powers. For the Kagyii tradi­tion, with its emphasis on the liberating power of guru devotion itself, Naropa's obedience and eventual enlightenment serve as an archetypal example, fortunately beyond literal emulation. Subsequently Naropa went to Nalanda, India's greatest Buddhist mon­astery, and became a great scholar there. Then, in the last years of his life, he established a hermitage, named Pullahari, where he eventually gave up all activity and entered silence, ceasing to teach. Later versions of Naropa's life, perhaps out of an antipathy to scholasticism, reversed this sequence, first depicting Naropa as a master ofNalanda and then showing him realizing the futility of mere study, abandoning his post, and going in search ofTilopa. The dates of his lifetime are given as fire dragon to iron dragon, which would be 9s6-I040. Atisa's departure for Tibet is reliably dated to 1040, and he brought relics from the cremation of Naropa with him. The bronze stupa in which they are enshrined still survives near Lhasa next to the shrine in Nyethang Dolma Lhakhang temple, which Atisa founded. A once-common dating for Naropa of I o I 6-11 o o was the result of taking literally Tsangnyon Heruka's version of the life ofMarpa, in which Marpa in his old age goes to India to meet Naropa, who sings a verse of praise ofMila­repa. However, this episode and its verse were derived from one of Tsang­nyon Heruka's visions and are without historical basis.32 Marpa In contrast to the early years of the Nyingma traditions, when Tibet was united under a central monarchy, the Tibetan plateau of Marpa's time was divided among small kingdoms, oligarchies, and nomadic regions. Tibetans, on their own initiative, were going to Nepal and India to receive teachings not available in Tibet, sometimes bringing masters back with them. Marpa was one of these Tibetan translators of Dharma texts who during this time were given the honorific title of lots,iwa (from a middle Indic locchdva, said to mean \"eyes of the world\"). Also at this time, the far-western kingdom of Guge. which saw itself as the successor to the ancient monarchy, brought Atisa to Tibet. Atisa's pupil. Dromton, established the Kadam tradition, whose teachings would in turn become a key ingredi�nt in the tormation by Gampopa of the monastic"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Translator's In troduction 15 Kagyii. The Guge monarchs did not approve of higher tantra practices, with their sex and sorcery, meat and alcohol. Nevertheless, Tibetan translators such as Marpa continued to introduce higher tantras, such as Cakrasarpvara, into Tibet. In time, with the fu sion of Marpa's lineage with Kadam teach­ings, the controversial aspects of the tantras were marginalized. Nevertheless, this higher tantra substratum continued to lie below the surface, reappear­ing in certain practices or biographical episodes of Kagyii masters. We also see these elements in some of our texts, in particular Dakpo Tashi Namgyal's overview of the tantras. Marpa's dates are uncertain and vary from one source to another/3 but he most likely was born around 1011 and passed away in the 1090s. Marpa's first teacher was Drokmi Lotsawa (992l93-1043l72), whose teachings became the fo undation fo r the Sakya school. Marpa collected gold in his midteens and went to Nepal and India fo r further teachings. He then met Naropa and spent many years studying with him. The wealth he received fo r giving these instructions back in Tibet funded further expeditions. Marpa in his biographies is portrayed as an aggressive, corpulent land­owner with nine wives, engaging in disputes with his neighbors; he even has his pupil Ts urton kill his cousin through sorcery as his fe e fo r instructions.34 As is clear from the earliest versions of his biography, Marpa did not receive the entirety of Naropa's teachings. On his second visit, Naropa had ceased tea ching and maintained silence, but Naropa did at that time give Marpa one of his last remaining possessions: a skull bowU5 Marpa subsequently studied with a number of other teachers, Maitripa in particular.36 Among Marpa's pupils, Ngokton (1o36-uo2) received practices and teachings that were not received by the more fa mous Milarepa. They were passed on through Ngokton's lineage, and in the nineteenth century were introduced into the mainstream Kagyii by Jamgon Kongtriil. Milar epa Although Milarepa is particularly fa mous because of the 1488 biography and song compilation by Tsangnyon Heruka, Milarepa's biographies had been the subject of considerable narrative evolution since the earliest versions. His songs also had multiplied and were transformed through centuries ofbardic tradition long before Tsangnyc>n Heruka's collection, which was tht· first to be printed, all earlier texts being handwritten manuscripts.

Milarepa's dates and lifespan vary considerably in the different versions of his life, but I040-1123 appears the most likely, particu­larly in terms of the year of his death._\\-Mila was his family name, and repa signified a nonmonastic practitioner who wore a cotton robe as a sign of mastering the practice of ca.r:u;lali. Accord­ing to Gampopa and Lama Shang, Milarepa's family consisted of only him­self and his father. He first became a sorcerer and then went to Marpa to receive teachings, in return for which he performed chores in the household, such as carrying water. When he eventually left Marpa to return home, he learned of his father's death, finding his home in ruins. In later versions, Milarepa has a mother who plays a strong role in his life by insisting he take up sorcery. Marpa has Milarepa single-handedly build and demolish houses in order to purify him of the bad karma accrued through sorcery. This does not occur in the earliest versions because sorcery was not only intrinsic to the tantras, it was practiced by many well-known masters of the time, including Marpa and his other pupils. The Tibetan las or phrin las, for the Sanskrit karman, is commonly translated in the con­text of the four karmas as \"activities,\" though it more properly translates as \"rites.\" The first two of the four rites, from a Western perspective, would be classed as white magic-the pacifying rituals to remove illness and so on, and the increasing rituals to bring wealth, long life, and so on-while the latter two would be called black magic-the controlling rituals, which bring people, particularly women, under one's control, and the wrathful rituals, which cause illness, madness, conflict, or death. However, these practices, within the Buddhist context, are intended to be performed with the com­passionate motivation of a bodhisattva. Moreover, the very sorcery practice that Milarepa mastered, a terma from his teacher LharjC: Nupchung, is cur­rently a part of the Kagyii transmission included within Jamgon Kongtriil's Tr tasury of Pruious Jm11as'w and is also one of the main practices of the Dri­gung Kagyii. Until the 1488 version of Milarepa's lite, he was consistently described as an emanation, enlightened from birth. In one biography he is even an incar­nation of the Buddha himsdt: where he states, .. I am the emanated rebirth of master Nagiirjunagarbha, who was an emanation of the Buddha himself as prophesied by the Buddha, \" and the author adds, \"Therefore he truly was Niigiirjunag<lrbha, the emanation of the Buddha.\"'-� However, Tsangnyon portrayed him as an ordinary being with extremely bad karma who has to"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"TrttnsLtto,.:f Introduction 17 overcome many obstacles in order to achieve enlightenn1ent. As the biogra­phy is also one ofTibet's greatest literary works, this has made Milarepa a fig­ure of inspiration fo r practitioners in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.·'n Milarepa's pupils were predominantly peripatetic repas like himself. Mila­repa literally adopted his first pupil. Rechungpa (1o84-116I), on meeting him as a boy of about twelve years old. Some early texts present Rechungpa as Milarepa's principal pupil. with Gampopa relegated to the list of \"pupils from the latter days.\" This is because Gampopa stayed with Milarepa fo r only thirteen months in 1122, just before Milarepa's death. Rechungpa established a nonmonastic tradition and even had a reputation fo r refusing to teach monks, especially since sexual practices were intrinsic to the repa lineage of that time. Gampopa Gampopa Sonam Rinchen (I079-II S3). also known as Dakpo Lhaje, the first of our authors, was a monk from the Kadam tradition. Kadam monks at that time were fo rbidden to receive highest yoga tantra empowerments because of their sexual content. This would make Gampopa seem to be an unlikely pupil ofMilarepa, let alone his successor. However, it is Gampopa's union of two apparently antithetical traditions to fo rm the Dakpo Kagyii that would fo rm the fo undation fo r the immense development of the monastic Kagyii traditions. By establishing a graded path, a majority of pupils could concentrate on monastic discipline, scholarship, and less-advanced meditations, while a minority could progress to the advanced teachings of Milarepa. Gampopa spent many years in solitary meditation before establishing a monastic com­munity in the Dakpo region. His monastery was on the Daklha Gampo mountain range, which became the name of his monastery and the source of his sobriquet Gampopa. The biographical literature on Gampopa evolved to portray him as predes­tined to transform the Kagyii lineage into a great monastic movement, while Rechungpa was increasingly portrayed as temperamental and unreliable. For example, in stark contrast with an earlier version of Milarepa interpreting a dream of Rechungpa's as auspicious, Ts angnyon Heruka has Milarepa inter­pret Rechungpa's dream to mean he will not achieve buddhahood fo r three lifetimes because of disobedience. It was Ts angnyon who introduced the con­cept of Gampopa as the \"sun-like\" disciple and Rechungpa as the secondary"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"r8 Mahamudra and Related Instructions \"moon-like\" disciple, a status often presented as Milarepa's own viewpoint. Most egregiously, the earlier literature contains a passage where Milarepa, on parting with Rechungpa for the last time, states that he has given all the instructions to him alone and to no other, but that one instruction remains. He then shows Rechungpa his calloused bottom as an exhortation to con­stant sitting in meditation.41 The more popularly known Tsangnyon version repeats this episode but substitutes Gampopa for Rechungpa, even though as a monk, Gampopa could not have received Milarepa's entire teachings, which would have included consort practices.\"2 Tsangnyon's version omits all references to Milarepa's partners in sexual practices (except for mountain goddesses when he was in his seventies), as this aspect of the Kagyii transmis­sion, although described in this volume by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, was mar­ginalized by the mainstream monastic Kagyii tradition. Gampopa, with his scholastic background, was the first in the Kagyii school to author a significant number of texts. His substantial text on the graduated path entitled the Ornament of Precious Liberation continues to be an essen­tial foundation text for Kagyii study.\"3 The text of his that opens this vol­ume, A String of Pearls, is primarily focused on general teachings and is greatly informed by his Kadam studies. Yet it also contains seamless references to mahamudra and its Nyingma equivalent, dzokchen. A number of texts in Gam­popa's collected works are not technically composed by him but are transcrip­tions and notes of lectures that he gave, and the attributions of certain texts are contested. A StringojPear/s collects together twenty short transcribed lectures that were intended to serve as guides for others to transmit the teachings they gave. The colophon attributes the teachings to Gampopa and states that they were compiled by by Gomtsiil. Gampopa's nephew and successor: ...

Sub­sequently, newer monasteries became branches of a central monastery; some lineages developed transregional significance while others, such as the Ye lpa, Trophu, Ya sang, and Taklung, presently consist of a few monasteries or important lamas.

Therefore Shonu Lha would have been active in the first half of the thir­teenth century. This text is an early example of the mahamudra preliminary practices. Here they consist of the contemplation of the preciousness of a human life capable of practicing the Dharma, its impermanence, the suffering of sam­sara, and therefore the urgency to practice.

Drigung Kagyu Ji.kten Sumgon, or Drigungpa (1143-1217 ), was a pupil ofPhakmo Drupa dur­ing the last three years of the latter's life 53 and fo unded Drigung Monastery, which gained secular power. The Drigung succession was initially hereditary but became an incarnate line beginning with two brothers, Konchok Rinchen (1590-1654) and Chokyi Drakpa (1595-1654). These were the first Chetsang and Chungtsang tulkus, the principal Drigung lamas-or K.hyapgon Rinpo­ches-through to the present day. A group of fo ur Drigung Kagyii texts appears in this volume. In 1226, nine years after Drigungpa's death, Sherap Jungne (1187-1241), who was Drigung­pa's nephew and successor, compiled two texts of aphorisms, the second a sup­plement to the first. To this are added two appendixes, which may be by Sherap Jungne or by a pupil of his, and together these fo ur texts, collectively entitled the Single Viewpoint, represent Drigungpa's view on an array of subjects. These are unusual and controversial texts, as each aphorism is basically a rejection of someone else's view. Though the holders of these views are not mentioned by name, the views are often those of Sakya authors. Sakya Pai:u;fita (u82-1251), who had met Sherap Jungne in the year before the writing of the Single View­point, wrote his major work on the three levels of views specifically to refute the views propounded in this text. However, Drigungpa also rejected one of Lama Shang's views propounded in the text included in this volume. Lama Shang states that some people who receive a fo rmal empowerment do not receive it, while others may receive it"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"11 Mahtimtuirti anti Re/4utl/nstructions without undergoing the ceremony. According to the twenty-sixth viewpoint in Shcrap Jungnfs supplementary text, Drigungpa took exception to this position. Drigungpa had little tolerance for moral ambivalence; for example, he rejected the possibility that sorcery could be classed as a good action. Dri­gungpa also hdd extraordinary views on the universal nature of the monas­tic vows and held a low opinion of tcrmas. The practices of many present-day Drigung Kagyiipas arc primarily derived from tcrmas and also include wrath­ful rites of sorcery, but ncvcrthcJcss. and in spite of the cryptic nature of certain passages. the texts arc still regarded in the Drigung Kagyii as funda­menrally important because of their numerous astute and striking observa­tions. For example. one aphorism states that the most important results of our actions arc experienced in this life rather than the next. To those familiar with the teaching on karma, this �ems at first a strange remark. What it points to, however. is the commonsense observation that our practice should bring manifest results. such as less anger, increased patience, insight, and so on. A number of commentaries in the tradition explain these pithy state­menu. The uanslation here has been guided in particular by Shcrap Jung­ne'• own COmmentary tO his textS.

Therefore, he initially had a tantric con­sort, but in I I 6 5 he beca1ne a pupil of Phakmo Drupa, who told him to sep­arate from her. He subsequently practiced peripatetically around Central Tibet. He performed rites to ensure victory fo r Lama Shang in his battles, and in his last years he was the abbot ofNaphur Monastery. His pupil Ts angpa Gyare (n6I-I2.n)5s fo unded Namdruk Monastery, from which the Drukpa lineage derives its natne. Though there have been various branches of the Drukpa Kagyii lineage, the hereditary lineage of Tsangpa Gyare's monastery became the principal succession. After Kiinga Paljor (I42.8-76) declared himself the rebirth ofTsangpa Gyare and became known as the Second Drukchen, there were both hereditary and incarnation successions. The Fourth Drukchen, Perna Karpo (152.7-92.), proved to be one of the great authors of Tibetan Buddhism. One of Perna Karpo's short texts on mahamudra, still widely used fo r meditation instruction, is included in this volume. A dispute over the recognition of the Fifth Drukchen split the Drukpa Kagyii. The two opposed candidates, even into adulthood, were Paksam Wa ngpo (I593�I64I) and Shapdrung Ngawang Namgyal (I594-I69I). The latter was also the hereditary holder of the Drukpa lineage, but as a result of the opposition of the king of Ts ang, Shapdrung retreated to the border­lands and created both the independent country of Bhutan and the \"south­ern Drukpa school,\" which is still the official religion of that country. 56 The successive incarnations ofPaksam Wa ngpo are the Drukchen incarnations of the northern, or Tibetan, Drukpa Kagyii. KarmaKagyu Diisum Khyenpa (ni0-93) was from a hereditary Nyingma fa mily and had mastered Yamantaka to the degree that, between the ages of ten and fifteen, he could cause death with its sorcery. He met Gampopa and Gomtsiil in 113957 and subsequently received instructions from Rechungpa. He then practiced meditation with exceptional perseverance and disregard fo r per­sonal comfort fo r many years in various locations. In us9, six years after Gampopa's death, he returned ro his homeland in"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"14 M.zhdmudrd and Related Instructions east Tibet, and twenty-six years later he established there the foundation for a widespread school by founding Karma Monastery. In 1189, at the age of seventy-nine, he returned to Central Tibet and founded Tsurphu Monastery. He said that he had returned to fulfill a request by Gomtsiil, who had died twenty years earlier, and to persuade the sixty-seven-year-old Lama Shang to terminate his martial exploits. Both lamas died four years later. Diisum Khyenpa was the first in a succession of Karmapa rebirths, mark­ing the beginning of the now ubiquitous tulku system of incarnate lamas. Gampopa, Lama Shang, and Diisum Khyenpa had recognized lamas and children as rebirths of great masters, but the Second Karmapa, Karma Pak­shi (1204-83), was the first to inherit the monasteries and authority of his predecessor. He was born eighteen years after Diisum Khyenpa's death and was not recognized as the rebirth of the First Karmapa until he became a pupil of the holder of the Karma Kagyii lineage. ss The Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje (1284-1339), established a Karma Kagyii canon of practice and study, introducing a number of teachings from other lineages. He performed the enthronement ceremony for the thirteen­year-old emperor Togan Temur (r. 1333-70), the last Mongol to rule China, who was ousted by the founder of the Ming dynasty. Of all the Karmapas, Rangjung Dorje has produced the most important body of literary works. This volume presents two of his short works. The first, his Mahdmudrd Prayer, is a popular text for teaching the meaning of mahamudra and has been translated elsewhere numerous times. The transla­tion here has been made to accord with the commentary of the Eighth Situ that closes the present volume. The other text is less well known: Instructions for the Mahdmudra In nate Un ion. This practical manual for meditating on mahamudra guides the practitioner through the stages of sa matha (stabil­ity) and vipasyand (insight). The Ninth Karmapa would later create a series of these manuals, includingMahamudrd: The Ocean of Definitive Jv/eaning.�9 That text and Dakpo Tashi Namgyal's Mahamudrd : The Moonlight are the two most extensive mahamudra manuals used in the Karma Kagyi.i. The Fourth Karmapa, Rolpai Dorje (1340-83), recognized his prin­cipal pupil and successor, Khacho Wangpo (I3S0-140S), as the rebirth of Rangjung Dorje's pupil Drakpa Senge (1283-1349 ), thus instituting the suc­cession of Shamarpa tulkus, who were often successors and teachers to suc­cessive Karmapas. The Ming emperor Yong Le (q6o-1425; r. 1403-25) presented the Fifth Karmapa, Deshin Shekpa (1384-141S), with a bejeweled black hat, which has"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"TranJ!ator's Introduction lS since played an important role in blessing ceremonies by all the Karmapas. The Karmapa, however, turned down Yo ng Le,s offer to use his armies to give the Karma Kagyii dominion over Tibet. Emperor Yo ng Le also bestowed the tide Khenting Ta i Situ on one of the Fifth Karmapa's pupils, Chokyi Gyaltsen (1377-1488), who became the first in the series of Situ incarnations. During the period of Karma Kagyii engagement with the Ming dynasty, the Ninth Karmapa, Wa ngchuk Dorje (1SSS-16o3), identified the Sixth Sha­marpa, Chokyi Wa ngchuk (1584-1630 ), who would succeed him as the head of the Kagyii lineage. Although his life was not long, Chokyi Wa ngchuk had a great reputation as a scholar and debater. He is the author of one of the works in this volume, the Quintessence of Nectar. That text on the six Dharmas of Naropa includes recitations as well as instruction. It is the very text that Karma Kagyii practitioners use in the school's traditional three-year retreats. Ts ele Natsok Rangdrol (b. 16o8) was a pupil of both the Sixth Shamarpa and the Te nth Karmapa, Choying Dorje (1604-74). He composed the eighth text in this volume, Ihe Bright Torch. He was recognized as the rebirth of a lama as a child, and he had both Kagyii and Nyingma teachers. By the end of the seventeenth century, the Karma Kagyii had lost its polit­ical hegemony in Central Tibet to the Fifth Dalai Lama, so that their strong­holds in the eastern regions of the Tibetan plateau, such as in the kingdom of Derge, became increasingly important fo r them. The Eighth Situ, Te n­pai Nyinje (1700-7 4)-also named ChokyiJungne-revitalized the Karma Kagyii in many ways. At the age of twenty-seven, under the patronage of the Derge monarchy, he established Palpung Monastery, which became, in prac­tice, the most important Kagyii monastery in Tibet. Situ Chokyi Jungne had secular authority within the Derge kingdom, was honored by the Chi­nese emperor Chi'en Lung (1735-96), and taught at his court. He intro­duced the transmission of many practices and promoted the philosophical viewpoint prevalent in the Jonang tradition, which the Fifth Dalai Lama had suppressed in Central Tibet.60 Tai Situ Chokyi Jungne also oversaw the preparation of a new edition of the canon, the Derge Kangyur and Te ngyur. He was one of the most prolific authors in the Kagyii tradition and even made new translations from Sanskrit. The seventh text in our volume, his commentary upon the Mahdmudrd Prayer written fo ur hundred years ear­lier by the Third Karmapa, is one ofTai Situ Chokyi Jungne's earlier works. He wrote it at the age of thirty-three, around the time he was establishing Palpung Monastery, commencing what was to become the modern era of the Kham-based Karma Kagyii.61"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"16 Mahtimudrti and Related Instructions Acknowledgments It has been a great privilege to take part in this visionary work of Thupten Jinpa, whose intelligence and motivation is only matched by his patience, which had to be vast to encompass my apparently never-ending twid­dling, three computer deaths, prevarication, and delays.

To have genuine Dharma practice, first meditate on impermanence. Oth­erwise, your Dharma practice might become merely an aid to your ambitions fo r this life. Why should we meditate on impermanence? To turn our minds away from this life. Meditating on impermanence makes us realize that all the phenom­ena of appearance and existence,63 of samsara and nirvana, are impermanent. As a result, the mind does not get caught up in this life. This is the purpose of meditation on impermanence. If your mind hasn't turned away from this life, then your meditation on impermanence has been without purpose. First, turn your mind away from this life by meditating on impermanence. Then meditate on the faults of samsara. The purpose of meditation on the faults of samsara is to turn the mind away from the entirety of samsara. When your mind has turned away from samsara, meditate on bodhicitta. First there is meditation on relative bodhicitta-wishing, fr om the depths of your heart, that all beings will have happiness, freedom from suffering, and complete buddhahood. Then view everything you do as being fo r the welfare of all beings. Have no concern fo r your own desires but develop an aspiration with the Mahayana perspective of benefiting others as your goal. That is how you meditate on relative bodhicitta. Meditation on ultimate bodhicitta is simply remaining in the mind as it naturally is, a state in which all thoughts of perceiver and perceived, self and other, are intrinsically devoid of reality. Practicing in that way during each"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"\\l .\\[,,IJ,imudr.i .md Rt'i.ttt'd lmtru(/ionJ of the tour kinds of behavior\"\"' is what is called meditation on ultimate bodhi­citta. Practicing in that way brings the realization and attainment of ultimate: bodhicirra. There is no Dharma other than this. [ 2] This Dharma teaching can be given to anyone. You must engage, right now, in lengthy contemplation. Think! This life is impermanent. Consider how it is fleeting, like lightning in the sky, bubbles in water, or dewdrops on the grass, so that whatever you gain in it will be of no benefit. Keep this thought in the very center of your heart. With this thought in the center of your heart, practice. You must follow the perfect, unmistaken path until you reach buddhahood. What is this per­fe ct, unmistaken path? It is taught to have three parts: the preliminaries, the main part, and the conclusion. Begin with the preliminaries. First think, \"May all beings have hap­piness and fr eedom fr om suffering, and may they attain complete buddhahood.\" Whatever main practice you then do, make that part of the path through the six perfections. For example, if you give just one thing to a beggar, that itself is generosity. Giving it in a gentle manner is correct conduct. Not gen­erating an affiiction, even if the beggar is ungrateful, is patience. Giving it quickly is diligence. Offering the gift without being distracted fr om love, compassion, and bodhicitta is meditation. Knowing that the recipient, the giver, the gift, and the result are all just a dream or an illusion is wisdom. Be certain that your main practice has the six perfections. In the conclusion, you seal [your practice] with complete objectlessness. In that way everything is taken onto the path, because everything has the same nature, which is clarity and the lack of real existence. Thus, you practice in this way: begin with the Mahayana perspective, which is to focus your mind upon the welfare of beings. It is important to develop the Mahayana perspective because buddhahood can only be attained through the Mahayana; not even the slightest fr action of budd.hahood can be attained through the lower vehicles. The main practice is the complete and unmistaken path of the perfections. The concluding practice is the alchemy of objecdessness, through which you understand that everything is like space. That knowledge prevents"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"A String of Pearls 33 propensities (vdsana) from being established in the alaya. When propensi­ties are not accumulated in the alaya, there will be no basis fo r karma. Free of that basis, you will not be compelled to follow good or bad karma and will therefore not be reborn. That is what is called buddhahood. That knowledge is the perfect, unmistaken path. [ 3] Even when on this perfect, unmistaken path, if you don't practice it in order to attain the accomplishment of all benefits, then merely sleeping on the least of beds, consuming minimal fo od-such as drops of water-and controlling the length of your breaths will not do you any good. Therefore, summon the confidence to practice diligently, starting now. There is no Dharma other than that. ·3· This Dharma teaching can be given to anyone. We need to practice both accumulation and purification. It is important to gather the accumulations and purify the obscurations. This life is like a Rash of lightning in the sky, and so on, and thus we don't know when we will depart and vanish. Therefore, it's important that in the depths of your heart you are free from needing anything and that you meditate on relative and ultimate bodhicitta. Meditating on impermanence is vital because that develops relative bodhicitta. Meditate on love and compassion by [contemplating] the faults of sam­sara. Then disregard your own benefit and accomplish whatever benefit you can fo r others. To attain buddhahood, you must first want to benefit beings. Then, dur­ing the intermediate stage, until you attain buddhahood, you must continue to benefit beings. In the end, once you have achieved buddhahood, you will do nothing but benefit beings. Therefore, first you meditate on death and impermanence; in the middle, you meditate on the faults of samsara; and in the end, with love, compassion, and bodhicitta, you do nothing other than benefit beings. We need to combine three thi ngs in order to meditate on ultimate bodhi­citta: ( 1) training in previous lives, ( 2) our own efforts, and ( 3) the blessing of the guru. Had you no training in a previous life, you would not have obtained the fr eedoms and opportunities of a higher existence perfectly endowed with seven qualities.6s Yo u must have trained in previous lives, during which you continuously gathered the accumulations."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"34 Ma hdmudrd and Related Instructions If you make no effort, you will be lefi behind on the path of laziness and fa il to reach the path of the noble ones. Without the blessing of the guru, you will develop no qualities; nothing will come to you. Even if something does come, it will fa de away. Yo ur merit will be like a dammed river. It is as taught in the scriptures: [ 4) If you have no guru, there will be no end to existence. If you do not have oars, your boat will never reach the far shore.66 Therefore, you first need to have trained [in previous lives]; then you must practice through your own effort; and, as the ultimate commitment on the path of the Mantrayana, you must rely on a genuine guru; so keep your com­mitments carefully. Merely knowing the words of teachings is of no benefit; that is like a par­rot reciting. Every guru has gained their accomplishment through their prac­tice, too. Through our devotion to the guru, we too can receive blessing, and through correct practice we can gain various signs of accomplishment. Naropa had devotion fo r his guru Tilopa and was his pupil fo r twelve years. [Tilopa] did not actually give him any teaching, but because [Naropa] revered his guru and did whatever his guru told him to do, he attained vari­ous signs of accomplishment. Thus, when there is a genuine guru and a wor­thy pupil, all qualities can be instantaneously accomplished. First there is peace and stability; in the middle there is clarity and non­thought; and in the end there is complete freedom from all conceptual elab­oration. It is taught that you will then rest, like the continuous Bow of a river, in the meaning that is like space. The scriptures also say: Complete buddhahood in an instant; one instant makes the difference.\"� Therefore, it's important to simply practice and have faith. If you haven't been doing this, keep in mind that when the time comes when you use your hand as a pillow and have no appetite fo r anything but water,�>11 nothing will help you except the Dharma that you've practiced. Therefore, it's taught that it's important to practice with effort, start­ing now. There is no Dharma other than that."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"A StringofPearL� 3S This Dharma teaching can be given to anyone. In order to practice the Dharma purely, we must be aware that there is no time fo r leisure in this life, and we must be totally dedicated to [the Dharma]. It is vital to meditate on love and compassion. Yo u develop them in three ways: ( 1) through focusing on beings, ( 2) through fo cusing on phenomena, and ( 3) through objectlessness. The first of these, fo cusing on beings, means developing love, compassion, and bodhicitta. [s] Yo u fo cus on all beings, on how they suffer from not having realized the true nature, and think that you must somehow free them from suffering and help them meet happiness and attain complete buddhahood. None of your actions should be fo r your own benefit but should be fo r the benefit of\"the lords\"-all beings. It is the lords, all beings, who enable you to attain complete buddhahood; therefore you must fo cus on beings. If your mind disregards beings, you won't be able to attain liberation and omniscience. It is taught that we should deeply cherish the love, compassion, and bodhicitta that are fo cused on beings, who are of the greatest importance. Developing bodhicitta through fo cusing on phenomena: All phenom­ena are but dreams and illusions. Therefore, see whatever action you do as a dream or as an illusion. From the scriptures: If you have meditated that all phenomena, which are like illusions, are like illusions, you will attain buddhahood, which is like an illusion.69 When you know that all phenomena are like dreams and illusions, anger will have no reality, and you will be spontaneously freed from it. Similarly, know that all attachment and aversion are like dreams and illusions, so that your mind will never engage in attachment or aversion. If you see all actions, such as lying down and sitting, as like dreams and illusions, then your attachment to the reality of appearances will easily cease. This practice will enable you to easily attain the supreme accomplishment dur­ing your lifetime. This is called bodhicitta through focusing on phenomena. The bodhicitta with no object is free of all conceptual elaboration. It is the practice that nothing has an existent essence. According to Guru Atisa:"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"36 Ma hdmudrd and Related Instructions All those mistaken in the realization of this meaning are like a deer caught in a trap. Oh pity! If they do not realize that, there is h �a now ere to go ... · If you practice the experience of there being neither coming nor going, with no conceptual elaboration of a meditator and meditation, [the bodhicitta] will come. Those are three ways of developing love, compassion, and bodhicitta. Practice them in this way. There is no Dharma other than that. ·5· This Dharma teaching can be given to anyone. If we sever our ties to this life and always have genuine faith, then every Dharma practice will be profound. There is a verse taught by the Buddha that appears at the conclusion of the water-torma offering: Perform no bad actions, perfect the practice of good actions, [ 6] and tame your own mind: That is the teaching of the Buddha.71 In addition to avoiding all bad actions, we must practice accumulating good actions and tame our minds. When we have tamed our own minds, that will be buddhahood. It is said that all we ever need to practice is that one Dharma teaching. From the Wisdom upon Pa ssing Away Sutra: All things are impermanent, so meditate on the understanding that is free of attachment to anything. If the mind is realized, that is wisdom. Therefore, meditate on the understanding that buddhahood is not to be sought anywhere elsc.�1 Thus, things arc impermanent. Yo ur inner cognition is impermanent because it changes.

Yo u have to practice perceiving that nothing has reality. Even your own body is impermanent, because it is only on loan fro m the fo ur elements-a loan that is easily repaid. Therefore, have no attachment to anything, because all things are impermanent. It's taught that wisdom means understanding the mind. This is what's known as the realization of the nature of the mind. It is also called knowing the inseparability of self and others, or of appearance and emptiness, or of the ultimate and the relative, or of space and wisdom. Yo u will not find this meaning if you search fo r it anywhere else. It is only known and realized by the mind looking at itself. That is what is called buddhahood; you will see the unseen-your own mind, which you have never seen before. [Buddhahood] is the result of realizing your own mind. That is what is meant by not searching fo r buddhahood elsewhere. When you practice in this way-leaving behind all concerns fo r this life­you will accomplish the goal of any Dharma gateway that you enter. This is why it's taught that it's so important fo r your practice to be free of ambitions fo r th is life. If you teach the Dharma while having goals in this life, you will just be a wicked person who is able to talk about the Dharma. Therefore, a practice that is unmixed with this life is of the greatest importance. There is no Dharma other than that. [ 7] This Dharma teaching can be given to anyone. We individuals who are sincerely practicing the Dharma need to think a little. It's taught: Life is short, and there are many things to know. We do not even know how long our lives will be. Eagerly obtain what you wish fo r, like a goose drawing milk from water.73 Life is short, so we don't have much time fo r leisure. Compared to the heav­ens of the Four Great Kings and so on up to AkaniHha, and compared to life in the hells, human life is short. The shortest human lifespan is here in Jambudvipa, where those over sixty are living on borrowed time."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions There is such a vast number of ways to know that life is short, we would never reach the end of studying them.

Therefore, there is no end to learning. If there's that much to [know about] the mukhajvalas, the shortest Dharma teaching, it goes with­out saying that fo r other teachings there will be even more. Since there is no end to knowledge, we can't master it all. Therefore, we must obtain what is essential, like a goose drawing milk from water. When cows cross the Ganges River in India, they drip milk into the water. A goose's beak contains yeast, so that when it stirs that water, lumps of milk appear, which the goose can then pick out and eat. We should eagerly obtain what we want in the same way. In other words, we should extract the teaching that we desire from the diversity of knowledge. We practice this teaching in order to gain control of our own minds and make them capable. Those who are attracted to generation and completion practices must have a mind capable [of practicing] them. This means that the mind must be capable [of practicing] the channels, winds, and drops, the relative and ultimate, the mahamudra, and dzokchen. What is a capable mind?

Buddhahood is attained through \"the lords\"-beings. Yo u must practice developing love and compassion toward beings and think, \"I do so wish that beings could become free from suffering and attain happiness.\" To summarize and analyze: In the mahamudra tradition, your practice must always be free fr om three faults. Yo ur practice must be free from the fault of appearances, the fault of emptiness, and the fault ofbirthlessness. What is such a practice like? Practicing without believing in the reality of appearances is to be without the fault of appearances. When you practice, see all appearances as dreams or illusions, and see all appearances as devoid of intrinsic natures. When you know that appearances have no reality, you will understand that suffering has no reality. Suffering will not actually disappear spontaneously, but it will be transformed into Dharma. Simply knowing that the appearances of self and others have no reality is to become free from the fault of appearances. Freedom from the fault of emptiness is said to be freedom from attach­ment to emptiness. [9] If you think, \"This is emptiness,\" or \"I am going to realize emptiness,\" then there will be a desire fo r emptiness, which is an error. When you know that the afH.ictions and thoughts are empty and that the objects that cause suffering are emptiness, they will be birthless. That is free­dom from the fault of emptiness. Freed om from the fault of birthlessness is when you do not alternate between appearances and emptiness. It is the knowledge that both appear­ances and emptiness are birthless. This is freedom from the fault ofbirthless­ness, also known as freedom from dualistic knowledge. In brief, freedom from the fault of appearances is freedom from attach­ment to the extreme of appearances. Freed om from the fault of emptiness is freedom fr om attachment to the extreme of emptiness. Freedom from the fault ofbirthlessness is fr eedom from attachment to the extreme of dualistic appearances. According to the mahamudra tradition, the qualities of the three kd_vas are in these three freedoms from fa ults: freedom fr om the fa ult of appear­ances, freedom fr om the fa ult of emptiness, and freedom from the fault: of birthlessness. When there is freedom fr om the fa ult of appearances, the extreme ofsatll­sara ceases, and there i!) the union of appearances and emptiness, which is the nirma1)akaya (emanation body)."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"40 Mahtimudrti and Related Instructions When there is freedom from the fault of emptiness, you will not be a sravaka, nor be in a sravaka's state of peace, and so there will be the unceasing sarpbhoga kdya (enjoyment body). When there is freedom from the fault of binhlessness, the mind's con­tinued desire fo r emptiness ceases, which is the binhless dharmakdya (Dharma body). It is taught that the great brahman lord76 explained this way of practice. There is no Dharma other than that. ·8. This Dharma teaching can be given to anyone. We have no time fo r leisure in this life. We must continually exhort our­selves with the hook of mindfulness. We must put our trust in the guru and in the [Three] Jewels. How do we know that this is so? Life is impermanent. Even were we to have the rare opportunity of a long life, we would still have little time fo r leisure. No one other than the guru can teach us the path. All the buddhas in the three times rely upon a guru in order to achieve buddhahood, so it's impor­tant to depend upon a guru. It's taught that: Before there is a guru, there is not even the name \"buddha.\"77 Therefore, it's taught that we must depend upon gurus and listen to their teaching. We must put our hopes in the refuges, the Three Jewels. We Dharma prac­titioners have no other refuge than the Jewels. We have to truly turn our minds to the Jewels. It's taught that if we do, we will definitely gain every­thing we need and wish fo r in this life and in future lives. When we have placed our trust in the guru and the Jewels, we should practice as is concisely described in the tradition of Aro Yesh( Jungne:\" which teaches that we must practice these three words: Appeamnces, arising, are.�"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"A Strinf!;o(Pearls 41 <; • What do these three words mean? If they n1 ean \"whatever appears and whatever arises, \" then if you look at whatever appe,zrs, they are arising as a variety, and when you look at yourself. it is your own mind that arises as a variety [of th ings] and appearJ as a variety [of things]. Both the appearing and arising are the thoughts of your own mind. Those very thoughts are your own mind, [10] and so as they arise from your own mind, they are the true nature arising as a variety. That arising as a variety of appearances is [nothing but] the birthless nature of your own mind. The inseparability of mind and appearances is itself the nature of the mind. It is therefore an appearance of the mind. Meditate knowing that your own mind is birthless. Even though various things occur and are experienced, meditate that they are the birthless, empty dharmakaya. Practice that the mind's nature is birthless. There is no need to fe ar appearances, fo r they are your own mind. Whatever bliss, clarity, or nonthought arises does not transcend the nature of the Mahayana's dharmakaya. Meditate on this without a moment's distraction. If you believe all appearances are real, even though all appearances are the dharmakaya you will not transcend the three realms of samsara and could become wicked. Appearances are not like that. Don't develop partial compassion. Even hawks and wolves have partial compassion, which therefore will be of no benefit to you. The compassion that parents have solely fo r their own children is not true compassion but attachment. Attachment can be mistaken fo r compassion. The wise should contemplate this carefully; being without [partial compassion] can be mis­taken fo r nonattachment. 80 Therefore, don't develop a compassion that is comprised of partial love and compassion. Meditate on all beings impartially, and do so from the very depths of your heart. Don't let your practice trans­fo rm into your own aversions and attachments. As fo r practice, the dzokchen tradition has two lines of text that contain all practice: 1. The proposition that all the phenomena of appearance and existence111 are your own mind 2.. The attainment of certainty in the meaning of that [proposition] This means that all the phenomena of appearance and existence are your own cognition. When you are happy, it's yo ur own mind that is happy. When you are sad, it's your own mind that is sad. As it says in the scriptures:"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"41 Ma hamudra and Related Instructions The higher and lower existences-the outer world and the inhab­itants within-are your own mind. 82 Practice in that way, with the conviction that all the phenomena of appear­ance and existence in samsara and nirvana are your own mind, [a conviction that] cannot be attained by just practicing this once a year. This is the nature of the practice: I. Gain certainty that the nature of the mind is birthless. None of the phenomena of appearance and existence in samsara and nirvana have any independent existence whatsoever; they are by nature empty. Therefore, there is certainty that the nature of the mind is birthless. 1. When there isn't even attachment to [phenomena] as being dreams and illusions, [ 1 I] and knowing arises without partiality, then you will attain certainty in the unceasing play of the mind. 3· There is no birth or cessation in the essence of the mind and so it is not dual; it is like the ocean and its waves. This is certainty in the non­duality of these characteristics of the mind. 4· The intellect is liberated in the [mind's] essence because this nondu­ality isn't an object of the intellect and cannot be analyzed by logic. This is certainty in the nonduality of the essence. What is the purpose of teaching those fo ur reasons? 1.

To genuinely practice the Dharma, first abandon every single thought about this life. Those who wish to free themselves and all beings fr om the ocean of samsara must first meditate on impermanence and turn their minds away from this life. Meditation on the fa ults of samsara will turn the mind away from all phenomena of samsara. Then meditate on love, compassion, and bodhicitta. If you do not train yourself and meditate, people will scorn you, and you will fa il to develop experiences and realizations. Therefore, tame your mind as much as you can.

Never neglect to think, \"I will free all beings fro m suffering, give them happiness, and lead them to complete buddhahood.\" It's important that you fo cus sincerely on the welfare ofbeings without any self-interest. Never fo rsake beings in your mind. If you do, you will abandon the Mahayana and your spiritual teacher, which will bring you great harm. To fo llow your own desires and see others as enemies is not the right thing to do. The Mantrayana teaches that all beings are male and fe male deities, so how could generating the afflictions toward deities ever be the right thing to do?

Dedicate all your positive actions of body, speech, and mind to the wel­fare of all beings, to the purification of their bodies, speech, and minds from obscurations. [Your good actions] should not be fo r the sake of your own mind alone. To sum up, you have been accompanied by these (negative] propensities for a long time, and so you must practice resolutely until you know that any­thing that appears is an illusion. Because the five poisons are spontaneously present, it is important to practice resolutely until the afflictions are trans­fo rmed into the path. The end of time is a long way away, and you have to continue practicing until samsara is emptied. Yo u have become habituated to propensities over a long period of time, and so you must practice until you know that everything that appears is an illusion. Karma from propensities is coming to meet you, karma from propensities is fo llowing you, and karma from propensities is presently going [with you].s3 The propensities are active in this way in the three times. If you can see that everything that appears has the nature of a dream or an illu­sion, then your belief in the reality of appearances will disappear like mist. The five poisons are naturally present. That is why you need to practice until the affiictions are transformed into the path. Although anger is natu­rally present, [ 13] birthlessness is also naturally present. Therefore, you need to habituate yourself to developing birthlessness the moment that anger is arising so that it will not arise. As soon as you know that anger is a dream, it will be transformed into the path. Know all five poisons in that same way. Through simply knowing that the five poisons don't stain, they will be trans­fo rmed into the path. The five poisons have been present fo r a long time, so you must be resolute until samsara is emptied. In general, it is the characteristic of the three realms84 that sam sara is begin­ningless.

Meditate until you reach independent freedom. Until then, there will still be good and bad, and so there will be the danger of the bad distracting you and leading you backward.

A String of Pearls 4S A genuine Dharma practitioner is always ready to give away anything, because life is impermanent and there's no time to waste. Yo u can train in generosity by giving away just fire or water. If you can't even give away fire or water, you will be reborn as a thin-throated preta. If you can habituate yourself to [giving away] water, you will eventually be able to easily give away your head, legs, arms, and eyes, and this will release you fr om samsara. Therefore, train first in giving away fire and water. Then train in giving away minor things. Then give away things to which you're attached or fe el you really need. This is how one practices on the path of the perfections. To summarize, samsara and nirvana are nothing but two words. It is said in the scriptures: It was taught that afflictions arise to the extent that there is fixation. It was taught that complete purification is when the fo cus on \"me\" and \"mine\" ceases.86 As long as there is fixation, there will be afflictions. [ 14] For example, fixation on the self creates attachment, and fixation on other87 creates aversion. Fixa­tion on children creates attachment; fixation on enemies creates aversion. Fixation on the pleasant creates attachment; fixation on the unpleasant cre­ates aversion. Fixation on praise creates attachment, and on and on. Fixation on these various dualistic perceptions prevents liberation from samsara and will send you to a place of constant suffering. Therefore, it's taught that you must do the opposite of fixating on \"me\" and \"mine.\" This means that you practice by looking at the self to see whether it is real or not, whether it is permanent or impermanent, and whether the self has its own nature or not. Looking at the self in that way makes you see that it is impermanent, which fr ees you from attachment to the self. With no attach­ment to the self, you are freed from all attachment. Until now, because of your perception of \"me,\" there was also \"mine.\" When there is \"me\" and \"mine\" you wander in samsara. Because of \"me\" there is a variety of\"mine;' such as \"my child,\" \"my enemy,\" \"my wealth,\" and so on.

The thought, \"I must practice the six pertcctions.· should be in the depths of your heart. To summarize Dharma pr.Ktice: you must understand the ultimate and tht' relative. It is taught in the Pertcction Vehicle that. on a relative level, there is karma. the ripening of karma. all the phenomena of complete atHiction, such as birth, old age. h••ppiness. and suffering, and there is the complete purification of nirvana and the qualities of the kayas and wisdoms."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"A Strine; of Pearls 4 7 <.: • Relatively, while there are still thoughts of self and other. all good and bad actions will be real, so you must be extremely careful when it comes to good and bad actions. All the good actions you perform from now on will ripen as good results in a future life. All the bad actions you perform from now on will ripen as bad results, as suffering in lower existences. There is no result without a cause, and buddhahood cannot come from wrong or inferior causes. It is said in the Perfection Ve hicle, within the Sutra of the Complete Ga th­ering of Qualities: Until you have perfected good karma, you will not attain sacred emptiness.811 If you don't practice the ten good actions, the ten Dharma conducts,89 or the six perfections as your causes, you will not attain buddhahood and will be in great danger of having a meaningless view and be left with an ordinary mind. All you listening here, fo r as long as you see yourself as real, then everyone else in the six classes of existence will also be real. As soon as you no longer fixate on the reality of yourself, you will naturally be liberated [from belief in the reality of] all beings in the six classes of existence.90 Until there is that natural liberation from fixation upon reality, there will be relative truth, so there will also be causal actions, and the ripening of the results of actions.

It's taught that when there is natural liberation from the relative and you have abandoned \"I\" and \"me;' then there will be no rip­ening of karma in the ultimate. To whatever extent there is ultimate truth, that is realization. It is freedom fr om thoughts of attachment and desire, from the pride of arrogance, and fr om language's terminology. All thoughts of self and others naturally cease so that there are no appearances of self and others. That is the realization of the ultimate, in which there is no karma or ripening of karma. When you have that realization, you are free from self-interest and will do whatever you can to benefit others, to benefit beings.

Faith may vanish from time to time, but if you still have a sense of shame, it will be a great help in preventing you from becoming separated from the Dharma. A sense of shame can also induce fa ith, so it is vital. If you have no shame, then as your faith grows old, you may commit many non-Dharma actions. Yo u may perform easily deeds that should never be done in this world, such as killing your parents. If you commit those kinds of bad actions even just once, you will have no conscience and your ambitions will be uncontrolled.

If fa ith and shame come together. whatever you do will be Dharma. It will be like glazing gold. Gold is excellent in itself but applying a glaze im­proves it. Apart from making you focus solely on practicing Dharma with faith, how can a sense of shame, of feeling shame before others, also bring ben­di.t to yourself and others?

Digestion through meditation on love and compassion, in meditation and post-meditation. This is familiarization with meditation over a period of time, and it's like the moon of the first lunar day.9� Following the prelimi­nary of love, compassion, and bodhicitta, the meditation develops just the beginning of samadhi, which is simply seeing the essence of the mind.

Thus there are fo ur methods fo r digestion-the best, the two intermedi­ate, and the lesser. There are three methods for remaining within the area of a Dharma prac­titioner: (a) The supreme method is to continuously remain within that area by staying in the mountains. (b) The medium method is to remain within that area by staying in a closed retreat. (c) The lowest method is to remain within that area by receiving teachings and keeping the three vows.98 There are two kinds of conduct: (a) The supreme conduct is that in addi­tion to staying within the Dharma, you accomplish whatever benefits beings. (b) The lesser conduct is the peaceful and subdued deportment that inspires others to have faith in you. The fo ur methods of digestion and the three methods fo r remaining within an area are very important, but the two kinds of conduct are essential. Therefore, lords, if you do things haphazardly, you will not \"digest the fo od\" and you will not enter the ranks of Dharma practitioners. So master those [methods] to whatever extent you can. Staying in a place where there are villagers that keep your mind occupied, or staying in a place where vows and commitments are not kept, will lead you and others to the lower existences.

This life is impermanent. Death is utterly certain because, having been born, death is inevitable. We do not know whether we will die now or at some other time. There is no guaranteed lifespan, so death may come at any time. The body has no essence, so death may come at any time. Many factors cause death: We nurture our bodies with fo od, but if we choke on fo od, it causes us to die. We put clothes on our body, but if they suffocate us, they are the cause of our death; and so on. Every favorable fac­tor can also be a cause of death. Death has numerous causes, such as enemies, water, and illness, so death may come at any time. We don't know when death will come, but can any­thing prevent it when it does? No, nothing prevents death. Even the wealth accumulated during your lifetime can't prevent it. A rich man can't buy his way out of death; he must leave his wealth behind and go on completely alone. Yo ur family and friends may be all around you, but they can't prevent your death; instead they can only do you more harm.

This is a Dharma teaching fo r meditators. In the present times, we have impermanent, short lives and have devel­oped only a little of the Mahayana mind. To summarize, practice what are known as the three yogas. These three are: I. Mantra yoga 2. Substance yoga 3. Phenomena yoga The He vajra Ttzntra says: If the three yo gas of mantra, substance, and phenomena are completed, there is no point in remaining in sarnsara. 102 Mantra yoga is the yoga of entering the door of generation, completion, or any other practice. The generation stage is the yoga of meditating on a deity. The completion stage is when you know the deity is like the moon [reflected] on water, like an illusion, [22] or like a rainbow. Both aspects are completed through meditating on a union of the generation and completion stages. That is what brings buddhahood. Even meditating solely on the generation stage will close the doors to the lower existences. Meditation in that way will create the correct mantra conduct. That is mantra yoga. Substance yoga is the knowledge that all wealth and substances are like dreams and illusions. Practicing in that way destroys your belief in the reality of appearances. The power of knowing them to be just dreams and illusions brings you to the levels of the pratyekabuddhas and the bodhisattvas. In the canon it is taught that: If you have meditated that all phenomena, which are like illusions, are like illusions, you will attain buddhahood, which is like an illusion.10·' Phenomena_yoga is the realization that all phenomena are like the center of pure space. This is called the realization of the equality of self and others, of \"is\" and \"is not,\" and so on. ln the canon it is taught that:"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"When you have meditated that phenomena, which are like space, are like space, you will attain buddhahood, which is like space.1114 A StringojPtarls ss That is the practice of the three yogas. If you are attracted to the activity of the Mantrayana's generation and completion stages, then practice mantra yoga. If you like substance yoga, meditate on the instructions on dream and illusion. If you are attracted to phenomena yoga, meditate that all phenom­ena are like the center of space. How can you meditate on all three yogas in one sitting? First meditate on the generation and completion stages. Then meditate upon dream and illu­sion in between sessions, during the fo ur kinds of activity. At the conclusion of any practice, rest in nonattention like the center of objectless space. It's taught that this practice accomplishes every benefit fo r yourself and others. Therefore, practice in that way. There is no Dharma other than that. This Dharma teaching can be given to anyone. To practice Dharma purely, you have to practice now, while your mind is based in a human body, while your five sensory fa culties are complete, [23] while you live in a land where the sacred Dharma is taught, and before this basis-which has arisen from merit accumulated in previous lives-is struck by death or illness. In your practice, it's important to fo rsake the ten actions that are to be avoided and pursue the ten good actions. The ten actions to be avoided are three of the body, fo ur of the speech, and three of the mind.105 The ten good actions are: 1. In addition to avoiding killing, one saves lives. 2. In addition to avoiding stealing, one practices giving. 3. In addition to avoiding sexual misconduct, one keeps the vow of celibacy. 4. In addition to avoiding lying, one teaches the Dharma. s. In addition to avoiding the three kinds of slander, one speaks [ concil­iatory words]. The three kinds are open slander, indirect slander, and secret slander.

In addition to avoiding covetousness, one rejoices at the wealth of others. 9· In addition to avoiding malice, one does whatever one can to benefit others. 1 o. In addition to avoiding wrong views, one repents the bad actions one has done and rejoices in the good actions. In chat way, you must avoid the ten bad actions and practice the ten good actions and the six perfections. The six perfections are not distinct from each ocher; each one is within all the others. They are the union of method and wisdom. Know that the action of giving and its karmic result are like dreams and illusions. Know that all six perfections are like dreams and illusions. When performing the perfection of generosity, for instance, do so without objectifying even the perfection of generosity itself. For it has been stated in the Buddha's teaching that: \"The path is to be practiced in an objectless man­ner.\"107 He taught that this is the same for all six. Avoiding the ten bad actions is the root, or the foundation, of the entire Dharma. The practice of the ten good actions is the practice of the six perfec­tions, and it benefits beings.

Whatever land and homes we have, we will have to leave them behind, so whatever we've done fo r their sake is meaningless. All our worldly activities have been nothing but non-Dharma. We have had no time fo r the Dharma during the day because we've been busy with work and none in the evening because of seeing to our stomach's wishes. This is the pointless suffering of being busy. Anxious to maintain our lives, instead of avoiding unpleasant bad actions and negative talk, we are deeply involved in them, which brings only suf­fe ring. They cause suffering in this life and in the next life, when we will be reborn in a lower existence. Let us look at the three poisons: We are deeply involved in internal and external desires, which we shamelessly satisfy. In this life our minds are under the power ofbusiness and profit and when we die we are reborn as a preta and suffer. This is meaningless. Anger makes us aggressive and heedless of death. Our minds burn, caus­ing suffering in this life and rebirth in hell in the next. This is meaningless suffering. Ignorance causes us not to know the difference between good and bad, so that we act incorrectly. We can't tell good from bad, but we become experts in deceit and deception, which is cleverness without purpose. As a result, we suffer in this life, find no satisfaction or contentment, and don't have a single moment of leisure. Because we don't know the difference between good and bad actions, in the next life we will experience the suffering of being reborn as an animal. This is also meaningless. All worldly actions are causes of meaningless suffering. Whatever we plan will be of no benefit. Whatever clever ideas we have will be of no ben­efit on the day we die. We cherish our children, but lose them, become sep­arated from them. When we depart this life without land, retinue, and so on, however important something might be to us, we can't say a single word about it or see one person. Arrogantly we never think of this. The scriptures teach: [25] At the time of death whatever you think of. whatever you look at, will be of no benefit, so what can you do? None of your children can be of help. Therefore always fa miliarize yourself with your own mind.109"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"s8 Afahamudra and Related In structions Looking at our own minds is beneficial and so brings happiness, but how do we go about looking at the mind to bring happiness? If we accumulate causal merit and then look at the resultant accumulation of wisdom, that is \"look­ing at the mind.\" Or if your interest is in the Mantrayana's generation and completion stages, then that is \"looking at the mind.\" During the meditation session, know that everything that appears is the mind. Look at your own mind and see that it has no shape or color. It is beyond any identification. All the conceptual elaboration of extremes of \"is\" and \"isn't\" are naturally and spontaneously liberated, and the intellect is not engaged in anything. That is \"looking at the mind\" in a meditation session, which is the true \"looking at the mind.\" Meditation on dream and illusion in the post-meditation periods is also \"looking at the mind.\" Continually accustom yourself to looking at the mind in these ways. If you do this kind of practice, the Dharma will be a remedy for your affiictions. When the Dharma is a remedy fo r your afflictions, you have attained the abil­ity to look at the mind. The Dharma teaches that: The afflictions agitate the mind and sink you in the swamp of ignorance. 110 It's very important that the Dharma be a remedy fo r the affiictions. If your practice is perfect, you will realize the meaning of deathlessness. If you have medium practice, you will be on the path. If your practice is mini­mal, you will not be reborn in the lower existences. It's important to practice with effort, and it's important to meditate. Without meditation, you can only slightly turn your mind away from desire, so you will not be liberated fr om death. Hence, meditation is vital. Through meditation, appearances will be overcome, and you will be natu­rally liberated fr om all belief in reality. Therefore, meditation is import<.mt. But does meditation itself actually exist? It's taught that: There is no meditation and no meditator.111 Therefore, there is nothing about which you can say, \"It is on this that I'm medit�lting.\" 'This is the ultimate practice that is called meditation.

Therefore, you need to gain the complete, unmistaken causes of buddha­hood so that you don't die before gaining the path to liberation. Buddha­hood is not attained without a cause, or by mistake, or from inferior causes. Buddhahood is not attained without gathering the two accumulations. It is not attained through the view, meditation, and conduct of the tirthikas. It is not attained through the Hinayana Dharma of the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. Why can you not attain buddhahood through the Hinayana Dharma of the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas? It's because they don't develop the moti­vation to benefit beings but wish fo r peace and bliss fo r themselves alone. Omniscience is not attained without fo cusing on benefiting others.

View them in that way only. In the center of your heart, resolve that all beings must find happiness, freedom from suffering, and complete buddhahood. In that way, your body, speech, and mind will perform good actions. [2.7] It is important, when you get up each morning, that you develop the motivation of thinking, \"Today, for the sake of all beings, I am going to apply my body, speech, and mind to good actions.\" Then your motivation will transform whatever you do on that day into a good action. Throughout the entire Dharma, the most important thing is transformation through motivation. Good motivation is important to have in general, for then whatever you do will be a good action. If your motivation is bad, your actions will be bad as well. A good motivation is like having a good servant inside you. It's important that your good actions of body, speech, and mind be of benefit to beings, even when you go to sleep at night. If you do that, then everything you do will be a good action and you will be on the path. Therefore, good motivation is vital. With that kind of motivation, the mind turns away from this life with its suffering and happiness, and your practice will be effortlessly transformed into the dharmakaya.

When th is realization comes, [ 2.8] you might think, \"There's no actual Dharma to be practiced. There are no gurus, Jewels, or yidam deities. There are no siddhis that have been attained, there are none to be attained.\" Then you will be in danger of losing your devotion to the guru, causing obstacle­causing maras to arise. It's taught that it's important at such a time to pray intensely to the guru, make offerings to the Jewels and the yidam deities, and meditate without partiality on love and compassion. If your devotion fluctuates, your Dharma experiences will also fluctuate, and you will encounter obstacles. Yo ur devotion to the guru must be con­tinuous. Experience and realization depend upon devotion. The guru creates the path and realization. In the Mantrayana tradition, blessings are known as \"the path of the guru.\" If you practice in that way, you will have a continuity of experience and realization. As a result, the one taste of the manifold will arise. When the one taste of the manifold arises, you will know that all appearances are the mind, that the mind is of one taste with emptiness, and that emptiness is of one taste with birthlessness. If at that time you have no fa ith when you see your guru or vajra siblings, this will be an obstacle from the maras. It's taught that it's important at that time to offer your body and possessions to the guru and Jewels; make prayers to them; compare your realization with your guru's other pupils or with experienced meditators; read what is known as \"the profound Dharma of Candraprabhakumara\";113 and listen to sutras, tantras, and treatises (sdstra). Can there be obstacles after the one taste of the manifold has arisen? There will continue to be obstacles fo r as long as thoughts continue. After the one taste of the manifold has arisen, envy is impossible because pure appearances are arising. It's taught that you'll have visions of the yidam deities and experience some clairvoyance, but whatever good qualities arise, you won't see them as real and you will know them to be mind.

It's taught that this is the actual meditation of mahamudra: [29] When you are naturally liberated from all fixation, attachment, belief in reality, and the fo cus of desire, you rest in the uncontrived natural state of the mind.

They also suffer from eat­ing each other: There is the suffering of the larger animals eating the smaller ones, the smaller animals eating the larger, the many eating the fe w, and the fe w eating the many. The happiest animals are those who are cared fo r by humans. But they also suffer fr om being loaded as if they're carts and used against their will. They are sheared, have their noses pierced, are milked, and so on. They are continually used until they are eventually killed. If humans are happy, they make the animals happy; if the humans suffer, they make the animals suffer. They are used as servants until they become old, and then they are taken to the slaughterer who returns them with staring, bloody eyes. Then they're eaten. Haven't you seen this suffering? There is nothing but suffering in the three lower existences, but it's taught that there are countless sufferings in the three higher existences too. The devas have the suffering of fa lling (35] to a lower existence when their life is over. Their adornments age, their light fa des, their deva companions aban­don them. They know they are dying. They suffer because they can see with their clairvoyance that their next life is a fa ll into a bad existence. It's taught that their suffering is unendurable, like fish writhing on hot sand. The asuras suffer because of fighting or because of being killed, wounded, defeated, and so on. It's taught that they too have countless sufferings. Humans experience the fo ur great rivers of suffering: birth, aging, sick­ness, and death. In addition, there's the suffering of taking care of what you have, the suffering of seeking but not finding what you don't have, the suf­fe ring of meeting, or being afraid of meeting, aggressive, angry enemies; and the suffering of being separated, or the fe ar of being separated, fr om beloved fr iends. In particular, in this degenerate age, there are such afflictions as Mon­golian governors, malevolent leaders, and slavery. If you don't have good things, that causes unhappiness; if you have good things, that causes suffering; if you have bad things, that causes suffering; having something causes suffering and not having it causes suffering.

Worlds are fo rmed within pure space and are destroyed by burning fire, scattering winds, and so on. Although this destruction occurs throughout many incalculable eons, space remains unharmed, never altered, and neither increases nor decreases. There is darkness when the sun's primordial brightness is completely obscured by clouds, and there is brightness when the clouds vanish. Despite this apparent increase and decrease, it is impossible fo r the sun's essence to increase or decrease.

They should turn away from the phenomena of samsara, have their minds fixed on nirvana, keep the discipline of striving for liberation, and learn the philosophies of the Vaibha�ikas and Sautrantikas.

When individuals who are gradualists enter onto the Mantrayana path, they keep far from negative thoughts and wish to be free from samsara. Their minds are fixed upon great enlightenment, and with motivation devoid of self-interest they develop the bodhicitta to benefit beings. They always have the pride of being the deity; they repeat mantras, recite, and offer mandalas and tormas; they practice the seven branches, such as offerings; they make a gift of tormas to pretas; and they offer water and medicine to the nagas. With their possessions, they honor and serve the guru, provide fe asts fo r the sangha, hold gaQacakras, give to beggars without reservation, perform the outer and inner homa fire rituals, creates tsatsas,•bll stupas, and statues, save the lives of animals, and chant the canon."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"1ht Ultimatt Suprtmt Path o(Mahtimudrd 109 In brief. in between the generation and completion practice sessions, they do nothing but good actions with a motivation of great compassion, never remaining in neutral activity, let alone engaging in bad conduct.

Therefore, avoid even the smallest bad action and practice even the smallest good action. Those who have continuous dil igence in the practice of good actions gain a small degree of stability and distinguish between outer and inner conduct. Their public conduct accords with other beings.

The mind is one-pointed maha mudra."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"136 Ma hdmudrd and Related Instructions Thus there are these seven Dharmas ofVairocana: ( 1) Sit with the legs in vajra posture. (2) Arrange the hands in the meditation mudra below the navel. (3) Straighten the spine. ( 4) Broaden the shoulders. ( s) Bend the throat like a hook, with the chin just pressing on the Adam's apple. ( 6) Place the tongue against the upper palate. ( 7) In general, your mind is changed by your senses, and in particular by the eyes. Therefore, gaze a yoke's distance in front of you, without closing or moving the eyes. There is also the presentation, in terms of function, of the five Dharmas of dhyana: (z) The crossed legs cause the downward-expelling wind to enter the central channel. (2) The meditation mudra causes the coexisting fire [wind) to enter the central channel. (3) The straightened spine and straightened abdomen cause the pervading wind to enter the central channel. ( 4) The bent throat causes the upward-moving wind to enter the central channel. ( s) The tongue against the upper palate and the gaze cause the pra.Qa (the life-force wind) to enter the central channel. As a result of those five winds entering the central channel, every karmic wind enters the central channel and nonconceptual wisdom arises. This is called the solitude of the body, the unmoving body, and the naturally rest­ing body. Expelling the stale breath and remaining silent is called the solitude of the speech, the unmoving sp eech, and the naturally resting sp eech. Do not contemplate the past. Do not think of the future.

[One-pointed yoga meditation without a base:} the com plete cutting through of suddenly appearing thoughts Meditation II If, while meditating as described above on the arising of a thought, the mind becomes involved with an object of thought, clarify the mind with mindful­ness, thinking, \"I must not have even a single thought that will cause me to continue with this thinking.\" Meditate on repeatedly cutting through the arising of suddenly appearing thoughts. Meditation I2 When you extend the above meditation, thoughts will eventually multiply until in the end one thought will come on top of another in an unbroken continuity. Identifying these thoughts is like recognizing an enemy. It is the first stage [of samatha], which is like a river rushing down a steep mountain­side. The mind is aware of the arising and ceasing of thoughts because it is at rest in every instant. The result is that it seems as if thoughts are multiplying, but thoughts have always been rising, so there is no change in their quantity. It's the nature of thoughts to arise one moment and cease the next. ii. [One-pointed yoga meditation without a base:} not changing whatever arises Meditation IJ Meditate by allowi!lg thoughts to go wherever they wish, while having your own mind spy on them without stopping them or fa lling under their power. This will result in a one-pointed samatha that cannot be disrupted by thoughts."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"142 Mahdmudrd and R(lated Instructions Meditation I4 Thoughts and so on continue to move rapidly, but by meditating as before, states of stability will last longer. This is the middle stage of stability, which is like a slowly flowing river. This key point of naturally resting the mind [ s3] will make it become clear. According to the Dharma lord [ Gampopa]: If the mind is unaltered, it becomes happy. If water is not disturbed, it becomes clear.187 According to the great lord of yo gins [ Lingrepa]: If you rest in unaltered freshness, there will be realization. If you can maintain this like the flow of a river, realization will be complete. Oh yog ins! Completely abandon all ideas of focusi ng the mind and rest continuously in equanimity.188 Concerning these two kinds of meditation, Saraha has taught the following: If it is bound, it will attempt to flee into the ten directions If it is set free, it will not move and be still. I have understood this paradox, which is just like a camel. 189 iii. [One-pointed yoga meditation without a base:} the key point for resting the mind This is in four parts: A) Resting like weaving a brahman's thread B) Resting like a sheaf of hay after its cor d has been cut C) Resting like a baby looking at a temple D) Resting like: an elephant bc:ing pricked by a thorn"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"A Ruord o(Afahdmudrd Instructions 143 A) Resting like weaving a brahman$ thread Meditation IS A thread should be [woven] so that it is neither too tight nor too loose. In the same way, if your meditation is too tight, you lose it in thoughts; if it's too loose, you will lose it in idleness. Therefore you must have the right balance between being too tight or too loose. Beginners should be tighter at first, cutting through the sudden arising [of thoughts]. Then when that becomes tiring, they should become looser by not altering whatever [thoughts] arise. By alternating these two approaches, a natural balance between being too tight and too loose will develop. Therefore it's taught that mind should first be tightened and then loosened and relaxed, as when weaving a brahman's thread. B) Resting like a sheaf of hay after its cord has been cut Meditation I6 Think that all previous remedies were just the arising of thoughts and that all you need is to be undistracted. Stopping thoughts is merely a remedy, and \"mindfulness in pursuit\" stains meditation, so abandon that kind of mind­fulness and awareness and rest naturally in the continuum of samatha. This resting, free fr om any mental effort, is like a sheaf of hay after its cord has been cut. C) [Resting like} a baby looking at a temple Meditation I7 When you tie the elephant of the mind firmly to the post of mindfulness and awareness, the breath will become naturally stilled. This will result in see­ing empty fo rms, such as smoke and so on; you will almost fa int with bliss; there will be a state of nonthought that is like empty space with no physical or mental sensations and so on. However, whatever kind of experiences you have, neither be pleased with them nor see them as fa ults. Don't fixate on them or stop them from occurring. Neither stopping nor fixating on appear­ances, which never cease, is like a baby looking at a temple. (84]"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"144-Afah.imudrJ .md Rr/,1/rd lmtruai\"m D) [Resting} like an elephant being pricked by a thorn Meditation rS When a thought arises in a state of stability, simultaneously there is mindful­ness that is aware of it. As the remedy and the fault are in direct contact, the thought cannot lead to a second thought. There is no deliberate application of a remedy; instead there is the \"spontaneous maintenance of mindfulness.\" Yo u experience thoughts arising, while simply remaining at rest, without either stopping or creating them. This is the meaning of resting \"like an ele­phant being pricked by a thorn.\"190 That is the last stage of stability, which is said to be like an ocean with­out waves. In this state of stability, there is the self-recognition of the mind's movements, and while there are these movements, the stability continues. Therefore this is called eliminating the distinction between stability and move­ment. That is the self-recognition in the one-point ed state. That which recognizes this stability and movement is called correct atten­tion or discriminating wisdom or self-knowing. From Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras: Therefore through that, one attains great functionality of mind and body, as well as attention and analytic knowledge.191 2. Analyzing the basis of stillness and movement and identifying it through vipasyand: th e meditation ofy oga without elaboration This is in three parts: a. Analysis of the root of stillness and movement b. Recognition through vipasyana c. Yoga without elaboration a. Analysis of the root of stillness and movement Meditation I9 When nonconceptual samatha has become discriminating wisdom, it ana­lyzes stillness to see what its essence is, how it is still, how movement comes"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"A Record of Mahamudra Instructions 145 from it, whether stability is lost or persists when there is movement, what the nature of movement is, and how it ceases. Meditation 2 o There is no movement separate from the stability and there is no stability that is separate from movement; so you won't find that stability or move­ment has an essence. In that case, is that viewer's knowing different from the stability or move­ment that it is looking at, or is it itself the stability and the movement? The analysis with the eyes of self-knowing does not result in finding any­thing, so that you realize the inseparability of the viewer and the viewed. No essence whatsoever can be located. Therefore, this is called the view that tran­scends the intellect and the view without an assertion. According to the lord of conquerors: The mentally fabricated view [ 8 s] is excellent but destructible. That which transcends the intellect does not even have the name \" . , v1ew. It is through the guru's kindness that you attain certainty in the inseparability of the viewer and the viewed.192 Acarya Santideva has taught this kind of analysis: Be dedicated to concentration without losing it fo r an instant; examine your own mind to see what it is doing. 193 There is the example of fire and firewood fr om the Sutra Requested by Kdfyapa: Fire comes fr om two sticks being rubbed together; its appearance burns up the two sticks. In the same way, when the power of wisdom appears, its appearance burns up both those two.1'J.I"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"146 Mahamudra and R�lated Instructions This kind of analysis is the analysis of the inward-looking, self-knowing. It is called kusali's analytic meditation. It isn't the paQ.Qita's analytic meditation, because that is an outward-looking knowledge. b. Recognition th ro ugh vipafyand Meditation 2I Whatever thoughts or afflictions arise, don't reject them. Without falling under their power, let all things that arise be just what they are, without alter­ing them. Recognize them at the very instant they arise so that, without elim­inating them, their arising is naturally purified as emptiness. In th is way, you can transform all adverse factors into the path. This is called bringing condi­tions into the path. Thoughts are liberated simply by recognizing them, which means you have realized the inseparability of the remedy and the remedied. This real­ization is the essence of the practice of the Vajrayana and is called paradoxi­cal meditation. Exceptional compassion will arise fo r all beings who have not realized the nature of their own minds. This transcends methods of body, speech, and mind that are practiced fo r the sake of all beings, such as the generation stage. This wisdom purifies you of all attachment to reality, so that there will be no afflictions. It's like consuming poison that has been blessed by mantras. It's taught that with this view of practice, whatever path you follow will be \"with­out adoption or rejection.\" c. The yoga without elaboration This is in three parts: 1. The analysis of past, present, and future [ 86] u. The analysis of things and nothing 111. The analysis of singleness and multiplicity i. The analysis of past, present, and fu ture Meditation 22 The past mind has ceased, is destroyed; the future mind is not born, has not arisen; the present mind cannot be identified. When you analyze in that way, you will see that all phenomena are like that. Nothing has reality;"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"A Record of�lahtimudrti Instructions 147 everything is just a creation of the mind. Therefore, you will understand that arising. remaining. and ceasing have no reality at all. Analyze as taught by Saraha: The arising of things has a nature like space, so when things are eliminated, what can arise afterward ? Their nature is primordial birthlessness. Realize today what the lord guru has taught ! ''�s ii. The analysis of things and nothing Meditation 23 Examine in this way: Does your mind exist? Is it a real thing? Or does it not exist? Is it nothing? If it exists as a thing, is it the perceiver or the perceived? If it is perceived, what is its shape and color? If it is the perceiver, there would be nothing else. If it is nothing, then what creates all this variety of appear­ances? Examine in this way. If there is an existent essence, then that essence can be established, but your cognition's examination does not find anything that exists. There is nothing to be fo und that can be established as existent, as having the qual­ity of a thing. As this is the province of self-knowing, it is not nonexistence or nothingness. Therefore, as there is neither a thing nor nothing, you do not fa ll into the paths of eternalism or nihilism. Therefore, this is called the path of the middle way. This does not come fr om establishing reasons or gaining cer­tainty through negations. It is through the guru's instructions that you see it clearly, like a jewel in the palm of your hand. That is why it's called the great middle way. When the guru's wo rds enter your heart, it's like seeing a treasure in the palm of your hand. 196 iii. 1he analysis of singleness and multiplicity Meditation 24 Is this mind single or multiple? If you say it's single, this word mind is used fo r something that has various manifestations, so how can it be single ? If you say it's a multiplicity, how could they all be the same in the mind's empty"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"148 Mahamudra and Related Instructions essence? [87] Thus, [the mind] transcends multiple or not multiple. This is called the completely unlocated mahdmudrd . In the meditation of the practitioners who have this realization, there is only their own self-knowing, and there is nothing else that appears. There­fo re, it is called devoid of appearances. In the post-meditation period, everything appears as an illusion, because this path has purified them of attachment to anything as being real. Thus, [according to Saraha): Lord, someone like me has today cut through delusion! So it doesn't matter what I see, in front, behind, or in the ten directions, I no longer have a question fo r anyone! 197 B. The sp ecial practices This is in two parts: 1.

Recognizing the unit y of appearances and emptiness through the example of water and ice Meditation 26 All phenomena that appear, at the very time that they appear, have no existent essence. Therefore, they are called \"empty.\" [88] In the same way, though they have no existence whatsoever, they appear as anything whatsoever. Therefore, they are said to be the union of appearance and emptiness, or the one taste, as in the example of ice and water. Knowing in the same way the union_of emp­tiness and bliss, emptiness and clarity, and emptiness and knowing is called the realization of the one-taste of the many. When that is realized, everything is that. No one can know anything that is other than that. That is what is read, memorized, and meditated on.200 c.

First of all [the guru] gives [the pupils] the vows of correct conduct (fila) and bodhicitta. Then [the guru] gives them empowerments that completely ripen them. Then they should practice in a pleasant and solitary place. First, cutting through the body, speech, and mind's bondage to the world, sit in the key physical posture upon a comfortable seat: The legs are crossed, the hands are resting level, the waist is straight, the throat is bent, and the eyes are looking toward the tip of the nose.

At the conclusion of the sessions make a dedication, reciting: May this be fo r the benefit of all beings. In that way, just the essential posture of the body and the guru yoga can develop samadhi. The Vinaya tells the story of how a monkey who had watched a pratyekabuddha in this key physical posture taught it to five hun­dred non-Buddhist rishis, who then attained the five kinds of clairvoyance, while [the monkey himself] attained enlightenment.

Keep your cognition focused on it, without interruption by any other thought. l. When [meditation on a visual object] has become stable, meditate upon sound, such as the sound of water, the sound of the wind, the sounds of creatures, and so on, directing the mind to any clear [sound) and keeping it there. 3· When [meditation on sound) has become stable, focus the mind on whatever good or bad smell is experienced by the nose and meditate upon that. 4· Similarly, meditate by focusing the mind upon the delicious or unpleasant tastes that are experienced by the tongue. 5. In the same way, focus the mind on any distinct pleasant or unpleas­ant physical sensation that is experienced. 6. When you are able to focus to some degree upon those [objects of meditation), meditate upon the phenomena that are experienced by the mind, by the sixth [consciousness], which are comprised of: a. Composite mental phenomena b. Noncomposite mental phenomena Composite mental phenomena THE THIRD MEDITATION First, samsaric phenomena-thoughts that should be eliminated-such as desi�e, anger, pride, the five kinds of [wrong) views, and distraction-inducing thoughts caused by the primary and secondary affiictions: Focus your aware­ness one-pointedly upon whichever of these appears clearly as an object of thought and meditate. Focus also on remedial thoughts, upon whatever arises in a virtuous mind, keeping the mind one-pointedly on them without interruption fr om any other thought. If you know this key point of mind­fully focusing the mind, then whatever thought appears, there will be stabil­ity unaffected by dullness or agitation. However, some people think they must forcefully stop thoughts, which are things to be eliminated. This is an extra obstacle on top of the instability of their minds and makes it difficult to develop samadhi. In relation to this, from Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras:"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"lnstructionsfor tht Afahamudra /nnatt Un ion 157 Because of engaging correctly with that desire and so on, [ 9 4] there will definitely be liberation fr om them. Therefore, those liberations definitely arise fr om them.21111 From the Hevajra Ta ntra : Through desire, beings become bound; through desire itself, they become liberated.210 That is what is meant by being skillful in method. Distinguishing the Middle Way from the Extremes also says : Objectlessness perfectly arises through dependence on an object. Objectlessness perfectly arises through dependence on objectlessness. Therefore an object is proved to be the very essence of objectlessness. As that is so, know that an object is the same as objectlessness.211 Therefore, first fo cus the mind by concentrating on an object such as a visual fo rm. Through a single concentration of the six consciousnesses, the mind's fo cusing on anything else will cease completely. Noncomposite mental phenomena THE FOURTH MEDITATION When that [meditation] is stable, [meditate] on the noncomposite. Do not even use the six objects as bases fo r fo cusing the mind but leave the mind just as it is, without creating any thoughts whatsoever, without any concepts con­cerning appearances and emptiness, defects and remedies.

In order to understand these aspects in detail, read my teachings on the nine meth­ods of mental stability and the eleven mental engagements. 215 Samatha's cause is reliance on correct conduct; its essence is to be devoid of afflictions and thoughts; its conditions are the creation of an exceptional mental sta­bility; its benefits are the subjugation of coarse afflictions and sufferings. The above was the stage of stabilizing the unstable mind. (95] The direct introduction that gives rise to vipafyand THE FIFTH MEDITATION Glorious Tilopa has said: Kyeho! This is self-knowing wisdom! It transcends the path of speech; it cannot be experienced by the mind. I. Tilopa, have nothing to teach. Know that it is revealed to you by yourself216 This means that having now stabilized the mind, examine the manifestations of six consciousnesses within that state of clarity and nonthought. Do the thoughts created by fo rm, sound, smell, taste, physical sensation, and mental phenomena appear as external objects (of perception], or do they come from the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, or the body?

Yo u will"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"lnJtructionsfor th� Mahamudra /nnatt Union IS9 gain the certainty that the six objects and the five senses are naturally clear but nonconceptual. The consciousnesses of the five senses-the visual consciousness that perceives fo rms, the auditory consciousness that perceives sounds, the olfactory consciousness that perceives smells, the gustatory consciousness that perceives tastes, and the tactile consciousness that perceives physical sensations-appear instantaneously in dependence on the sensory fa cul­ties and objects, and they are naturally clear and nonconceptual. Therefore, fr om among the six consciousnesses, that of the mind alone needs to be thor­oughly examined. When the mind is directed toward phenomena, such as the conscious­nesses of the five senses, it is naturally clear and nonconceptual in every instant. Therefore, there is no delusion within the six consciousnesses themselves. When the previous consciousness has ceased and the subsequent con­sciousness has yet to appear, that which is in the present instant appears clearly. Therefore, this relative truth is not to be rejected. Although [the present consciousness] is clear, it does not exist as a shape and it does not exist as a color. Creators such as self, fa te, Shiva, Brahma, atoms, unperceivable externals, puru�a, and so on21j have not created it. It is devoid of a real nature, and therefore the ultimate truth is not rejected. Even appearances and emptiness are inseparable; they can appear as any­thing, can be called anything, and therefore are completely liberated fr om being itself or other. This is what you should realize. \"This is self-knowing\"218 means that the unmistaken realization of that which is self-knowing is wisdom, because it knows the primordial true nature. Ordinary beings, who are [like] children, [96] don't know how to describe that direct perception. It is not within the experience of the afflicted mind's thoughts. Therefore, there is nothing to teach you until you have experienced it fo r yourself. This is also said in a doha: Don't disturb water or a lamp's flame; they are naturally clear. I neither perform going and coming nor reject them.ZI9 And also: Kyeho! This is self-knowing. Other than that there is nothing that can be directly taught. Do not be deluded about this.220"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"z6o Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions Also, in Summary of the View: That elaboration-free self-knowing appears while empty and is empty while appearing.

In this way gain certainty in nonduality.221 All texts have such teachings that can bring certainty through quotation and reasoning, but I shall stop here, so as to keep it simple. That concludes the introduction to the six consciousnesses. Thus, samatha and vipasyana arise by resting in the clear and nonconcep­rual mind and becoming familiarized to the nature of self-knowing, to the inseparability of appearance and emptiness. The coarser afflictions will then be overcome, and you will enter the true path. Therefore, the great masters of the past gave direct introductions by saying, \"See the mind!\" This stage accords with the following teaching: A vipa5yana that has excellent samatha is a knowledge that completely defeats the afflictions. Therefore, first seek samatha and accomplish it with true joy free from worldly attachment.222 Next I will explain: 1. How the guru introduces you to your own nature and you have expenences 2..

In the end, even if one fe els heat, cold, and so on, the bliss is only intensified. MENTAL BLISS The mind becomes happy, joyful, and free from pain. This has the same three stages as in physical bliss. Clarity [97] Clarity is also of two kinds: 1 . The clarity of the five senses 2. The clarity of the mind THE CLARITY OF THE FIVE SENSES The sign that the mind has become controlled is the appearance of what seem to be objects of visual perception: mirages, bright sparks that resemble fire­flies, lamp flames, moons, suns, firelight, dots of light, rainbows, and a vari­ety of beings and fo rms. THE CLARITY OF THE MIND As all thoughts of fa ults and their remedies arise, there is the knowledge of [the mind's] cognition, emanations [of thought], and their harmonious interdependence. And there is purity, clarity, freedom fr om sleepiness, and you think that you know all phenomena. Nonthought First, you maintain the mind's fo cus upon any object. Then thoughts cease and your mind remains resting wherever it has been placed. In the end, you experience the cessation of all thought activity.

In nonthough t, even though you've attained an unwavering state of mind, self-knowing will directly know the instantaneous arising and ceasing of mental activity. These are the signs that you are follow­ing the true path. You will go astray if you become attached to the taste of the experience of bliss, if you become proud of clarity and believe in its perfection, and if, through experiencing the taste of nonthought blended with neutral empti­ness, you start ignoring the law of karma. This may result in rebirth in the form realm, but this isn't the path to enlightenment. Therefore it's important [that your experiences] be accompanied by true wisdom. There are many ways of going astray during this time, but they are all included in these three: 1. Emptiness becomes your enemy. 2. Compassion becomes your enemy. 3· Thoughts about cause and result become your enemy. EMPTINESS BECOMES YOUR ENEMY Yo u think, \"All phenomena are my mind. My mind is free of [conceptual] elaboration. Therefore, nothing is real. So why should I make any effort with the body, speech, and mind? What is the point of doing composite good actions?\" This is going astray as a result of emptiness becoming your enemy. COMPASSION BECOMES YOUR ENEMY Yo u think, \"I must benefit beings through my compassion fo r all who don't have my kind of realization.\" Then, no [longer] listening [to teachings] or practicing, you abandon meditation and [98] dedicate yourself to compos­ite [actions], exhausting yourself by your attachment to the reality of your­self and beings. This is going astray as a result of compassion becoming your enemy. THOUGHTS ABOUT CA USE AND RESULT BECOME YOUR ENEMY Yo u see that everything is created by thought, and you think, \"I shall make myself omniscient,\" and then practice the minor, ordinary activities of gram­mar, logic, crafts, and medicine, throwing aside the power of samatha and vipasyana.

When thoughts manifest as clear appearances in the mind, enter into a clear and nonconceptual knowing. When you experience clairvoyance, the ten signs,223 or other vivid perceptions of the five senses, be certain that they are nothing but your mind and have no attachment to their reality, fixat­ing on their characteristics; instead, transcend it through your own fr eedom from [conceptual] elaboration.

Maximizing the results Yo u realize that the six consciousnesses and their six objects are nothing but your own mind and have no other creator. First, you understand that per­ceiver and perceptions have no reality; then you experience it; and finally you see it directly. It is important to identify the immediate mentation225 of the arising and cessation of all consciousnesses. Whenever any of the six consciousnesses arise, they arise because of the mentation of \"immediate activity,\" which when they cease, cause all good, bad, and meditation karma226 to blend with the mind's alaya consciousness. This is a secret that you should know. Along with [immediate mentation] there arises \"the affiicted mentation,\" which is the thought of \"I,\" belief in a self. attachment to a selt� (99] and pride, which, because they obscure you, create ignorance. When the six con­sciousnesses develop upon that basis, subject and object arc not recognized to be your own clarity, which creates thoughts of belief in the reality of the subject and object as \"me and mine.\" This is how all afflictions are created."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"164 Mahamudrd and Related Instructions It's taught that afHictions from the six consciousnesses, which are created by looking outward, are eliminated by [the path) of seeing, 227 while the afflictions created by looking inward are eliminated through [the path] of meditation. Sravakas on the paths of seeing and meditation gain peace through elimi­nating the afHictions that come from only one aspect of the view that there is an individual self, but they are ignorant of \"mental immediacy\" and of its remedy-the selflessness of phenomena-and therefore they remain far fr om the great enlightenment ofbuddhahood. Therefore, a wise ordinary individual who has reached the mental state of dhyana should meditate in the following way. When you rest in dhyana without thoughts, the six consciousnesses cease in space. When you arise fr om that samadhi, you can see the movement of the subtle mental activity of thought. If at this time, you don't have the view taught by a true guru, you will have the following deluded thoughts: You may have the nihilistic view, thinking, \"There is no reality to the mind and no reality to its arising and ceasing, and therefore thoughts have no cause.\" You may have the eternalistic view, thinking, \"Even though thoughts themselves cease, they are permanent because they will always continue to arise and appear.\" You may have thoughts about the self, thinking, \"These movements of consciousnesses all occur within a single mind.\" You may have the deluded thought that external objects should be stopped, thinking, \"Ifl stopped the appearance of external objects I would be in a state of nonthought, and so I must stop the appearances of objects.\" You may go astray by thinking that dhyana is the ultimate path, think­ing, \"The ultimate path is the dhyana in which the activities of thought have ceased, in which joy and bliss have ceased, in which the movement of mind­fulness and awareness has ceased, and in which the inhalation and exhalation of the breath have ceased.\" You may go astray in a meditative state without identification, thinking, \"The ultimate [path] is the nonconceptual clarity in which the identification that recognizes the characteristics of objects ceases.\" [ 1 oo] You may go astray into the formless [realm] if you believe that the ulti, mate [path] is when all appearances and solidity cease into a consciousness like space, or into an infinite [consciousness], or into nothingness, or into the absence of both identification and nonidentification.u�"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"lnst1·uctionsJor thr Mahamudrti Innau Union r6s This ignorance of the mind is the root of these and all other negative views in the three realms, such as that of belief in the individual self.22\"� It is [also] the source of all affi ictions. Therefore it is called the tifJlicted mentation. Its root is invalid conceptualization. When you have seen this, in the state of the clarity and non thought of the external six consciousnesses, you will enter into wisdom. The agitation of the mind's grasping at characteristics and engaging in acquiring and rejecting creates all the sufferings of samsara, while reme­dial knowledge creates all good karma and happiness in samsara. When you have understood this, mind, which thinks of and runs toward fa ults and remedies, should rest in meditation, in its own clarity and empti­ness, and train in each of the fo ur dhyanas, the fo ur fo rmlessnesses, and in cessation. During post-meditation, understand and be skilled in all the ways in which all fa ulty and remedial thoughts create causes, conditions, and results. Know that all thoughts of identification through the triple aspects [of con­ceptualization] are obscurations. Seal all phenomena with impartiality, with their empty and selfless nature.

To speak of\"all beings\" is the way of pure beings. From the Abbreviated Perftction of' Wisdom in Verse: There is no enlightenment without benefiting beings.21r. From the Sutra Requested by [the Naga King] Anavatapta: If a bodhisattva mahasattva has one quality, he will be in com­plete possession of all the qualities of buddhahood, which has all supreme aspects. What is that one quality? It is thus: It is an omniscient mind that does not abandon beings. 247 The pure thoughts of \"pure thoughts and actions\" are not negative moti­vations, such as avarice, malice, and wrong views, but positive motivations, such as love, compassion, and bodhicitta. From Twenty Vows: A good mind does no wrong. 248 [For example,] when Captain Mahakarut:lika slew a villainous merchant, he accumulated many eons' worth [of good karma] .249 Also, when Geshe Ben250 was about to meet some patrons, he carefully dusted [his room] and cleaned his face, images, and offerings, but on examining his motivation, he perceived it to be an insincere wish to create a good impression, and so he scattered a handful of dirt over everything. When Phadampa [Sangye]251 heard about this, he composed a praise of [ Geshe Ben]. Thus, even if an activity is slightly impure, with a powerful good motiva­tion, it is the same as performing a pure action. Pure action means good con­duct with body and speech, but all it requires is the development of a good motivation. [ 109] \"Snowy mountains\" is a metaphor fo r pure thoughts and actions. \"Rivers\" is a metaphor fo r the accumulations of virtue that come fr om [pure thoughts and actions).

These \"rivers of accumulations of virtue\" are said to be \"unpolluted by the triple aspects;' which means chat they are free of the polluting dirt of focus­ing on the triple aspects. This is because focusing can never be the path to enlightenment. From Entering the Middle l#zy: Even though you dedicate [merit] to buddhahood's complete enlightenment, chat [dedication] will be mundane if made with the threefold fo cus. If there is no fo cusing, that itself was taught by the Buddha to be supramundane perfection.252 Thus, such texts as the Mother of the Conqueror/53 teach that every good action that is accompanied by focusing is the \"mara activity ofbodhisattvas.\" According to Entering the Middle J!Vtly , which uses generosity as an example, the \"triple aspects\" are fo cusing on these three: the object [of the action], the action, and the agent. Generosity that is devoid of giving, receiver, and giver ... 254 None but aryas have true wisdom free from focusing on the triple aspects, but ordinary beings can have an equivalent understanding gained from scrip­tures and the guru's instructions. Generally, wisdom devoid of method is bondage to the aspect of nirvana, while method devoid of wisdom is bondage to samsara. Therefore, you have to practice both [wisdom and method] inseparably. This is why the words \"all ... beings\" teach the method of great compassion, and the words \"unpol­luted by the triple aspects\" teach the wisdom of emptiness. Similarly, from the Sutm Requested by Ak�ayamati: Wisdom devoid of method binds you to nirvana, while method devoid of wisdom binds you to samsara.

It is the primary condition fo r the sugatas' accomplishment of unsurpassable benefit. Arya Nagarjuna has taught: I pay homage to that which is neither one nor many; which is the basis fo r the great, perfect benefit fo r oneself and fo r others; which has the nature of not being nothingness and not being a thing; which has an equal taste, like space; which is difficult to realize; which is without stain; which is without change ; which is peace; which is equality of the unequal ; which is pervasive; which is without any elaboration; which is an individual self­knowing: the dharmakaya of all the conquerors, fo r which there is no example. 256 THE SA¥BHOGAKAYA This is described in the Ornament of Realization: It has the nature of the thirty-two primary signs and the eighty secondary signs. It is taught to be the Sage's sarrzbhogakaya (enjoyment body) because it enjoys the Mahayana.257 Although there appear bodies with every single attribute of the sugatas' fo rm kayas, they have no nature of their own, and thus they have no limitation. This is what the Vaj rayana calls \"bodies and fa ces with every fe ature.\" More­over, the sarp.bhogakaya teaches the Mahayana alone, because its pupils and realms are completely pure. THE NIRMA�AKAYA When there is true buddhahood in the fo rm of a sugata's sarpbhogakaya, just like the sun radiating light, the embodiments of spontaneous activity imme­diately appear within a variety of pure and impure realms. Tibetan schol­ars have taught that there are : supreme nirmdl}akdyas, who demonstrate the twelve deeds in Jambudvipa; born nirmdl}akdyas, who appear as beings, such as aryas and ordinary beings, but who can also appear as matter, such as stu­pas, ships, and bridges; and created nirmdl}akdyas, such as the lute player who was emanated to teach King Nanda of the gandharvas. zss However, Indian"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"180 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions scholars have clearly taught in their texts that a born ninnd�akdya is when a supreme nirmal)akaya takes birth in the k�atriya or another caste; acre­ated nirmd�akdya demonstrates a mastery of various skills; and a supreme nirmd�akdya demonstrates the attainment of enlightenment. That confo rms to the meaning of this passage from Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras: The nirmaQakayas of the Buddha, which always demonstrate skills, birth, great enlightenment, and nirvana, are the great method fo r liberation.259 [xu] THE SVABHAVAKAYA This is great peace and is the nature of all phenomena. It is attained through the power of the dharmakaya, through realization. The Vajrayana calls this the body of great bliss (mahdsukhakdya) because its distinctive quality is supreme, unchanging bliss. Arya Nagarjuna has said: I pay homage to that which is free from the activity of the three realms; which is the equality of space; which is the nature of all things; which is purity, which is peace; which has the nature of supreme peace; which is the yoga of absence; which is realized by the yogin; which is difficult to realize; which is difficult to analyze; which is beneficial to oneself and others; which is pervasive; which is fe atureless; which is free of thoughts; which is the one kaya; which is the bliss kaya, the equality of the unequal, of all the conquerors.260 Thus, [Rangjung Dorje] portrays the fo ur kayas as the ocean, the embodi­ment of vastness and depth, and [he prays] that the previously described riv­ers of accumulations of virtue will enter it.

It is as stainless as space, is the source of everything, and is called prq{undi�y beyond examination. It has the fo rm of mahamudra. It is like an illusion or a rainbow. It is that which purifies your own and other's beings. It is called n·ue dari�y. It is the supreme nature of nonduality. It is the lord that pervades all th ings.

Understand that the true nature is taught toward the end of this text. It is being taught at this point simply so as not to have a gap in this explanation [of the prayer]. The body and the mind's true nature of the basis are inseparable, like water and ice, and this is called the union. of the two kdyas at the time of the basis. This is revealed to the direct perception of self-knowing only through the power of meditation and not through any other method. There is nothing whatever to be removed in this; there is not the slightest thing to be added. Tr uly look at the truth; if you truly see, you will be liberated. 303 This alone is the sequential relationship of the three wisdoms. It's not definitely so fo r individuals with instantaneous realization, but generally, for individuals of gradual realization, a later wisdom cannot arise without there first being the earlier wisdom, because of the dependent relationship of one not arising if the other does not exist. Also, it is said [in Tr easury ojthe Abhidharma]: Those with good conduct, who have heard and contemplated, can dedicate themselves to meditation.304 THE FOURTH LINE May the radiance of the three wisdoms increase.

The two accumulations, free from the extremes of embellishment and denigration, are the supreme path. The attainment of the two benefits, fr ee from the extremes of existence and peace, is the attainment of the result. May we meet this Dharma that is fr ee of error. The first line teaches that which is to be known: the unmistaken true nature of the basis. The second line teaches that which is to be practiced: the unmistak.en practice of the path. The third line teaches that which is to be accomplished: the unmistak.en stage of the result. [121] The fourth line teaches that the Dharma that is unmistak.en in those three ways is the genu­ine, error-free path and prays fo r that. THE FIRST LINE The two truths, fr ee fr om the two extremes of eternalism and nihil­ism, are the meaning of the basis. \"Eternalism and nihilism\" are the terms fo r an er roneous and ignorant analy­sis of the basis, the true nature, and the mahamudra. This has two aspects: the eternalist view and the nihilist view. Their [respective] characteristics are ( 1) the conceptualization that believes in the extreme that all phenomena exist, and ( 2) the conceptualization that believes in the extreme that all phenom­ena do not exist. It is said [in Nagarjuna's Praise to the Inconuit'able]: To say .. it exists\" is the view of eternalism. To say \"it doesn't exist\" is the view of nihilism.-10� Who holds these views? They are primarily fo und among the tirthikas, but they are also fo und among Buddhists. Within the tirthikas, Rishi Brhaspati, in order that the devas would be victorious over the asuras in bat­tle, wrote a text teaching that there were no past or future lives and no good or bad karma.-'00 Those: who tollowed this, such as Rishi Jayarasibhana (a"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Oral Transmission of the Supreme Siddhas 19S contemporary of Dharmakirti),-'0� spread [this teaching]. It became known as Lokayata or Carvaka. This is the nihilistic view. These are what are known as the fo ur eternalist schools: 1. The Sarp.khya : fo llowers of the teacher Kapila, who believed in five principles·w11 and proclaimed that knowing them brings liberation 2. The believers in isvara:·w<� fo llowers of Rishi Kanada '11' or Rishi Aksa-. . pada,-'�1 who were given the supreme boon by the god isvara, and who believed in six categories,-m and so on, that were to be understood 3· The Va i�Qavites: the fo llowers of such teachers as Jayatirtha,m who believe Vi�Qu to be God 4· The Jains (Nirgranthas): the fo llowers ofRishi Jina,:'H who believe in six substances, m and so on There are also those who are known as Taj iks (Iranians), or Mlecchas (\"barbar­ians\"), who fo llow the tradition of the texts composed by the teacher Abra­ham,316 who was a fo llower of the asuras. In Tibet, there is the Yu ngdrung Bon tradition, fo llowers ofMiwo Shenrap.317 In China, there are the fo llowers of the tradition ofTaoism.318 These [three] are not actual tirthikas.319 The first of them, the Taj iks, have a conduct that is worse than that of the tirthikas. The latter two are slightly better than tirthikas in terms of not believing in a self and so on, but they are still to be included among the eternalists. [ 122] Among the Buddhists, Va ibha�ikas and Sautrantikas do not, generally speaking, deny the self of phenomena. They say that there are externally exist­ing indivisible atoms and so on.32° Cittamatrins state that knowledge of the emptiness of dualism has true existence, and therefore they believe in the per­ceiver as the self of phenomena. Those are the views ofbeliefin the extremes of existence or nonexistence. Acarya Sthiramati has written in his Commentary on the Ihirty Verses: Those who say, \"The known exists, just as the knower does:' believe in the extreme of eternalism. Those who say, \"A knower does not exist, just as the known [does not]:· believe in the extreme of nihilism.321 \"The two truths, fr ee fr om extremes, are the meaning of the basis\" means that the unmistaken meaning of the basis, the true nature, is fr ee fr om the two extremes of incorrect analysis; this meaning is the understanding of the union of the two truths. The two truths are ultimate truth and rela­tive truth."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"196 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions Ultimate truth is the true nature of all animate and inanimate phenom­ena. It is devoid of the eight extremes of conceptual elaboration. It is com­pletely pure, like the center of space. It is uncircumscribed, non partial, and totally transcends being an object of thought or speech. It is called the \"first buddha,\" the \"primordial lord,\" \"truth,\" and so on. Relative truth is the apparent nature of all animate and inanimate phe­nomena. It is the dependent origination of a diversity of conceptual elabora­tions. It is like an illusion. According to AcaryaJnanagarbha: The apparent nature-that alone is relative; the rest is the other.322 The two truths are primordially one. All the phenomena that have appeared within samsara and nirvana, animate and inanimate, have never had an indi­vidual essence even while they were appearing. They are free fr om the extreme of eternal ism, like reflections in a mirror. They are also fr ee fr om the extreme of nihilism, because even though they are always devoid of an essence, never­theless, their diverse appearances arise unceasingly. Concerning this, Acarya Naga[rjuna] has said: That which has emptiness, that can be anything. That which has no emptiness, that cannot be anything.-'2.1 If phenomena had their own real existence, they wouldn't lose their individ­ual characteristics. [123] One th ing would prevent there being another, and there would be no origination, destruction, and so on. There is no such diffi­culty if all phenomena are emptiness, fo r there can be dependent origination in emptiness. It is extremely important to know this and other [reasonings] in the six Madhyamaka texts ofNagarjuna.'z., From Fearing Nothing: .A Com­mentary on the Root Middle lfa_y: The Dharma taught by all the bhagavan buddhas has come about through these two truths: 1. The worldly relative truth: The [people of th is] world fail to under· stand the empty nature ofphenomena and perceive phenomena as hav­ing birth. That is relatively true tOr th em; therefOre, it is relative truth."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Q,·al Tram•misJion �(thl* Suprt*mt* Siddhas 197 1.

Therefore. one has to state that there are two truths.'26 Yo u must understand this secret essential point. which has been taught at length. THE SECOND LINE The two accumulations, free from the extremes of embellishment and denigration, are the supreme path. \"Embellishment and denigration\" are ignorance of the path that leads to the attainment of liberation. These are : 1. The extreme of embellishing nonexistence as existence: This is being without wisdom because of not knowing the process of dependent origination fr om emptiness. It is thinking, \"Only these appearing phenomena, such as karmic causes and results, are real, and nothing else has any reality.\" 2. The extreme of denigrating existence as nonexistence: This is having no method because of not understanding the essential point that the Jewels, karmic causes and results, and so on appear through depen­dent origination and can be effective simply as appearances. It is thinking, \"Only emptiness is real; nothing else has any reality.\" \"The two accumulations, fr ee from the extremes ... are the supreme path\" means that through accumulating merit in order to accomplish the fo rm kayas of the tathagatas, we avoid being in the extreme of denigration, [I 24] and through accumulating wisdom in order to accomplish the dharmakayas of the tathagatas, we avoid being in the extreme of embellishment. The unmistaken supreme path for the attainment of liberation is the name fo r the practice of an inseparable union of [the accumulation of merit and"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"198 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions wisdom]. Within the six perfections, generosity and conduct are the accu­mulation of merit; wisdom is the accumulation of wisdom; while patience, diligence, and meditation are both. From Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras: Generosity and conduct are the accumulation of merit; wisdom is that of wisdom; the other three are of both. 327 The necessity of practicing the union of [merit and wisdom] is described in Lamp on the Pa th to Enlightenment: Wisdom that is without method and method that is without wisdom were taught to be bondage. Therefore, do not be without either.328 From the Vimalakirti Sutra : Wisdom that is not supported by method is bondage. Wisdom that is supported by method is liberation. Method that is not supported by wisdom is bondage. Method that is supported by wisdom is liberation.329 THE THIRD LINE The attainment of the two benefits, free fr om the extremes of existence and peace, is the attainment of the result. \"Existence and peace\" are inferior goals and results. Method by itself. with­out wisdom, does not result in transcending existence. Wisdom by itself. without method, does not result in transcending partial peace. \"The attainment of the result\"-that is, \"the two benefits, fr ee fr om the extremes:· which means fr ee fr om the two extremes of existence and peace­is (through practicing the path described above, the union of the two accu­mulations) the attainment of the unmistaken result, which is also the union of the two kayas: the dharmakaya-a pertect benefit fo r oneself that does"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Orttl TrammiJsion of the Supreme Siddhas 199 not fall into the extreme of existence-and the fo rm kaya-which is a per­fe ct benefit fo r others and does not fa ll into the extreme of peace.

We are in error if we fa ll into any of the two extremes taught in relation to basis, path, and result. [125] Therefore, in order to avoid these errors and extremes, with the view of the basis, we eliminate the extremes of eternal­ism and nihilism. If they are eliminated, we will be free from the extremes of embellishment and denigration in our practice of the path. If these are eliminated, we will be spontaneously liberated from the two extremes of peace and existence as results. Therefore, the unmistaken path \"that is free from error\" is that which has the basis, path, and result described here. A prayer for the unmistaken practice of the path This is in two parts: I. A summary 2. A prayer fo r the practice of meditation A summary of the unmistaken practice of the path [Verse 7] The basis for purification is the mind-the union of clarity and emptiness. The purifier is the great vajra yoga of mahimudra. The purified are the stains of extrinsic delusion. May the result of purification, the stainless dharmak.aya, become manifest."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"200 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions The most important thing to understand in the practice of the mahamudra yoga of the path phase, which has the characteristics of an unmistaken path that have just been described, are these fo ur aspects: (1) the basis fo r puri­fication, ( 2) the yoga that purifies, ( 3) the stain that is purified away, and (4) the result that is attained through purification. Therefore, they are taught sequentially by one line of verse each, ending with an expression of prayer. THE FIRST LINE The basis for purification is the mind-the union of clarity and emptiness. \"The basis fo r the purification\" of every stain that prevents the accomplish­ment of liberation is identified as the mind, which has a pure nature. Its characteristics are established to be \"the union of clarity and emptiness.\" The Sublime Continuum teaches the reason why the pure mind is the basis fo r purification: Earth is based on water, water on air, and air upon space. Space is not based upon the elements of air, water, and earth. In that way, the aggregates, [sensory] elements, and sensory fa culties are based upon karma and afflictions. Karma and afflictions are always based upon improper mental engagement. Improper mental engagement is based upon the mind's purity, but the mind's nature is not based upon any phenomenon at all.1·11 Thus, the basis of all samsara and nirvana is taught to be the purity of the mind, which is the essence, or dement, of the tathagatas. [ 126] It is the basis fo r the purification, but it is not that which is purified, as it doesn't have even"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Oral Transmission of tht Suprtmt Siddhas 101 an atom of a phenomenon that has to be purified away. From Praise to the Dharmadhatu: That element, which is a seed, is said to be the base fo r all phenomena. Through its gradual purification the state of buddhahood is attained .. u2 And also: Those sutras spoken by the Conqueror in which he taught emptiness all eliminate the afHictions but do not diminish the element (dhatu).333 It's possible that some who analyze this will not be convinced, believing that the word mind designates something that is an accumulation, and as bud­dha nature is noncomposite, the word mind should not be used fo r it; it is also contraindicated in the Abhidharma and elsewhere, where the mind is taught to be the consciousness that is the abode (alaya) of all [karmic] seeds. However, we are not incorrect, because the mind has both pure and impure aspects, and those teachings are in reference to the impure aspect. There is also no contradiction in designating the mind to be an \"accumula­tion;' because it has, in a nondual manner, the sixty-four qualities3·'4 present in the basis and is therefore the source of all good qualities. From the Peifec­tion of Wisdom Sutra: As fo r [that] mind, the mind does not exist; the nature of the mind is luminosity.335 There is the Sublime Continuum quotation given earlier, but also Acarya Nagarjuna has said: In that same way, the five obscurations­desire, malice, laziness, agitation, and doubt-obscure the mind ofluminosity.w'"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"202 Mahamudra and Related Instructions In the sutras, tantras, and commentaries there are very many such instances where the purity of the mind is called mind. Secondly, it is a union of clarity and emptiness, but the Guhyasamdja teaches its empty nature: It is devoid of all things. It has no aggregates, [sensory] elements, or [sensory] bases. It has no perceiver nor perceived. Phenomena are selfless and equal. Therefore your own mind, which is primordially unborn, is the nature of emptiness.337 The Sublime Continuum teaches that it is naturally luminous and cannot be polluted by transitory stains: The luminosity that is the mind's nature, like the sky, never changes. It is undefiled by extrinsic stains, such as desire, arising from incorrect thought.338 [ 12 7] Countless such quotations establish the mind to be clarity and emptiness. The emptiness is never separate fr om the clarity, and the clarity is never sepa­rate fr om the emptiness. Therefore, they are a union with the characteristic of inseparability. This is what Lord Maitreya339 taught.-Hu There are academic scholars in this land of Tibet who have not understood this secret, essential point and explain this union to be a clarity and emptiness that accompany each other. They have strayed fr om the teaching of the Sugata. THE SECOND LINE The purifier is the great vajra yoga of mahamudra. The meaning of the second line is that on th is basis of purification, the \"vajra yoga of mahamudr�r is the path that is \"the purifier\" of the stains that arc to be purified. In the Dakpo Kagyii's graduatt:d instructions, worthy pupils rely upon qualified gurus and, according to the level of their ability, whether they first receive an elaborate empowerment or not, they practice the three pre­liminaries: (1) The general preliminaries, (2) the special preliminaries, and(�)"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Oral Transmission �{the Supreme Siddhas 103 the particular preliminaries. Then they practice the main practice, which are the two yogas of samatha and vipasyana. This is fo llowed by gaining certainty through direct introduction, in which there is the special realization of the ordinary mind seeing itself. There is also realization through the yogas of the two stages, which has the same essential meaning. There are some pupils who, because of the level of their capability and their master's power, gain realization solely by being blessed by the transfer­ence of wisdom. There are some who continuously familiarize themselves with the direct recognition that they gained during a word empowerment or the experience gained during the third empowerment of a sequence of fo ur empowerments that they have received. There are therefore various ways in which wisdom can manifest. During the [paths] of accumulation and engagement, wisdom is primar­ily an experience. On reaching the path of seeing, wisdom manifests within your own being. From that point on, the wisdom is stabilized in medita­tion sessions and becomes subtler during the illusory appearances of post­meditation. This gradually eliminates what is to be eliminated, just as one arm of a weighing scale rises as the other descends. Finally, there is the vajra samadhi at the end of this continuum, which leaves nothing to be eliminated and which brings the attainment ofbuddhahood. What is the nature of this wisdom? From theMahdmudrd Tilaka Ta ntra: Listen, Devi Mahamudra! Mahamudra is a great secret. It is inexpressible, inexhaustible, unborn. It has the form of everything and has no fo rm. [ 128] It is fo rmless and the sublime, supreme fo rm. It is not thin or thick and so on. Its nature can never be measured.341 From Acarya Nagarjuna's Commentary on Bodhicitta: The buddhas have taught that bodhicitta is not obscured by thoughts that conceive of a self, aggregates, and so on. It always has the characteristic of emptiness.-Hz According to Saraha:"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"104-.\\l.zh.imudrd iW d Rr/,ued !nJtmctiorJJ It has no color. qualities, words. or symbols.

To whom can one reveal th is sublime lord?14·1 Ir is beyond speech and thought bur can be clearly perceived by self-knowing, which sees the true nature of the basis fo r purification described earlier. It's taught that you can attain the wisdom of mahamudra without receiv­ing an elaborate empowerment, but in earlier and recent times there have been those in Tiber who, even though they had a reputation fo r being schol­ars, were unable to accept this teaching and made many criticisms of it. For example, some have said that no one can accomplish the Mantrayana's mahamudra without an empowerment and the two stages [of generation and completion]. Others have said that it's possible, with good meditation, to gain realization solely through the view of the Madhyamaka, bur if they have nor [practiced] the logic taught in the Madhyamaka texts, such as the \"reasoning rhar negates rhe fo ur possibilities of generation,\"34-l they will have many defects, such as a lack of certainty. The Bhagavan, in order to train various ki nds of pupils, taught countless such methods. Siddhas and scholars have taught these separately in various ways, disagreeing with each other over their explanations and disparaging [each other] saying, \"I am the one who knows. Only this teaching of mine is true and no other teaching.\" This supreme Kagyii tradition of instruction cannot be fa ulted on the above points, because, as will be explained fu rther on, none of the different kinds of instructions teach that it is compulsory fo r a pupil with exception­ally sharp fa culties to receive an elaborate empowerment. Still, they must first receive the blessing of the vajra-wisdom empowerment from a vajra master, and through that they will definitely gain the benefits of the two stages. There are those who say that empowerment by transmitting a blessing is not a real empowerment and that guru-yoga meditation is not the same as the two stages. [ 129] However, if [the first of those statements were true], then empowerments given through colored sand mandalas and so on would not be uue empowerments, because an \"empowerment\" must engender the realiza­tion of the empowerment's meaning within an individual, and an elaborate empowerment is less effective in engendering that realization than a simple empowerment. [If the second objection were true], meditation on deity yoga"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Oral Transmission of tht Suprtmt Siddhas z.os could not be the true practice of the two stages. because during that stage of the Mantrayana you have to see the guru and deity as inseparable. The guru seals the deity. If a deity is not sealed as is required. then it is simply an imagi­nary deity that cannot bestow the supreme siddhi. Therefore, our tradition's samadhi empowerment, or vajra-wisdom empowerment, is the supreme of all empowerments, and it is obvious that it is a true empowerment. It is a mistake fo r a realized guru not to give this empowerment to those with exceptionally sharp faculties, who are ready for the mahamudra, and instead to bind them with an elaborate empowerment. Know Indrabhiiti's extensive teaching on this subject in the Accomplishment of Wisdom. For example: The empowerment of vajra-wisdom, which is the attainment of excellent, supreme wisdom, and the elimination of all thoughts causes the accomplishment of the supreme siddhi. If you have the complete possession of true wisdom, you will be breaking your commitment if you bestow the empowerment separately as a drawn mandala. What suffering accrues from breaking the commitment? The benefits of the body and likewise the mind will diminish and you will quickly die. When you have died, you will have to experience the suffering of hells fo r hundreds of millions of eons. Even after you have left those existences, you will be born as an untouchable, or in an inferior caste, you will be born as mute or deaf. or you will be born blind; of that there is no doubt. The wisdom of all the tathagatas is called the vajra wisdom. If the wise one gives its empowerment, that should be known as an empowerment.M"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"206 J,fah,imudrd and Related Instructions Whether you have truly received an empowerment or not depends on whether the meaning of the empowerment has arisen in your being or not. Therefore, if the realization of the inseparability of appearance and emptiness has arisen in a pupil, that is receiving the vase empowerment, and so on. In the same way, meditation on the guru suffices as the generation stage. Familiarization with guru yoga [130] causes all appearances and beings to arise as the guru's manifestations, which is a greater cessation of ordinary grasping than even in meditation on a yidam deity. Also, many tantric com­mentaries state that the guru is the union of all the Jewels and that medita­tion on the guru will ac complish all siddhis. The [guru yoga] is also taught to be the completion stage, as it is the supreme path-free fr om all hindrance and error-which through the power of intense devotion, cultivates the experience of an objectless mind. This kind of secret, essential meaning is the province of those with the highest faculties and will never satisfy academics, and therefore should be recognized as an extraordinary, profound secret. As fo r the second criticism, this is also without substance, because the Mantray ana mahamudra's elaboration-free view corresponds with the Madhyamaka view. Therefore the realization of th e Madhyamaka view is not a defect in the Mantrayana. The academic teaching (of the Madhyamaka] was merely intended fo r debate with ti:rthikas, while its meditation through analysis cannot even be classed as belonging to the Madhyamaka. The Madhyamaka that is unadorned by the guru's speech is merely middling.346 The reason why the mahamudra's cessation of all conceptual elaboration cor­responds with the Madhyamaka view: Were anything higher than the Madhyamaka, that view would be a conceptual elaboration. H7 Thus, it is impossible that there is a higher view in the Buddha's teachings than that of the Madhyamaka.

THE THIRD LINE The purified are the stains of extrinsic delusion. What stains are purified by the purifier upon the basis of purification? This line states that the purified are the phenomena of perceiver and per­ceived, which even though they are not intrinsic, appear as a result of extrinsic delusion. As fo r the process of delusion and so on, this will be explained further on [in verse 10], which begins \"The self-appearances that have never existed are mistaken as objects,\" and can be understood there. [ 131] THE FOURTH LINE May the result of purification, the stainless dharmakaya, become manifest. What is \"the result of the purification\" of the purified by the purifier? With the eternal elimination of all extrinsic stains, which are all the phenomena of perceiver and perceived, the dharmakaya, which is the true nature of the basis, becomes manifest. From Praise to the Dhannadhatu: When obscured by the net of affi.ictions, it is that which is called a \"being.\" When it is free from the affi.ictions, it is called a \"buddha.\"Y19 If the dharmakaya alone is the result of purification, does that mean that the two fo rm kayas are not the result of purification? The fo rm kayas are in essence inseparable from the dharmakaya and therefore are the result of puri­fication. This is why it is enough to mention only the dharmakaya. The term dharmakaya can be used to mean all three kayas. The dharmadhatu, the great bliss, which is naturally stainless, is known as the dharmakaya, or the svabhavakaya. This has two purities because there is [also] the purification of extrinsic stains."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"208 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions When there is the purification and transformation of the dlaya conscious­ness, the afflicted consciousness, the mental or sixth consciousness, and the consciousnesses that engage with objects, then they become the dharmakaya, or the wisdom kaya, which is the attainment of the wisdom that knows ulti­mate nature and the wisdom that knows relative v�riety. The svabhavakaya and wisdom kaya are not two different kayas but are totally complete as the dharmakaya. When there is this attainment of the dharmakaya, the purified conscious­nesses I have listed [become] fo ur categories of wisdom: (I) mirror wisdom, (2) equality wisdom, (3) discriminating wisdom, and (4) accomplishing wisdom.

Through the power of ignorance, self-knowing is mistaken fo r a self. From Lord [Rangjung Dorje's] Profound In ner Meaning: The limitations of partiality do not exist in the cause, which is the beginningless mind. However, it has an unimpeded display, an empty essence, and a nature of clarity. Its unimpeded manifestation appears as anything whatsoever. When the [mind] is ignorant of itself, the movement of mental activity, a movement that is like waves on water, appears as the duality of perceiver and perceived. [The mind] focuses upon and grasps itself. That which appears to the externally oriented mind creates the consciousness that perceives that object. The adoption and rejection of it creates a sensation. Thoughts concerning it create identification. The composite appearance of the object is conceived of \" th \" as o er, and attachment to it creates the aggregate of form.350 In his own detailed commentary to these [verses, Rangjung Dorje states that] the luminosity of the naturally pure true nature of the basis, the mind vajra, does not know its own essence because of its generative power. This means that there is mental activity, which is the movement of mentation, from which arises the appearances of causes and conditions. This creates the state of being afflicted, so that there is ignorance. That mentation has two aspects: (1) immediate mentation, which causes the powers of the six consciousnesses, as they arise and cease, to be based upon the alaya consciousness, and ( 2.) affl icted mentation, which fixates upon the thought of the alaya as being \"I.\" Therefore, immediate mentation creates"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"212 Mahamudra and Related Instructions consciousnesses and affiicted mentation creates states of affiiction.

The alaya and our mentations act as causes and conditions fo r each other, like water and waves, and therefore this is the source fo r all the delusions of samsara. According to Acarya Vasubandhu: [Whatever is conceived of as self or phenomena, which fo rm in various ways, is the fo rmation of consciousness. That fo rmation has three aspects: Ripening, that which is called thinking, and consciousness of objects.] As to those, ripening is the consciousness named dlaya, which has all seeds. It is a nonconscious \"acquisition\" and a [nonconscious] discernment of location. It always has contact, attention, sensation,m identification, and intention.m Its sensation is equanimity, which is unobscuring and neutral. It is the same fo r contact and the others. It continues like the flow of a river. It ceases in the state of an arhat.m [134] And (also from that text]: Based upon it, there develops the consciousness named mt11tation (manas) that has [the i.laya] as its object and is the: nature: of thinking.

They appear through the interde­pendent combination of sensory objects, sensory faculties, and conscious­nesses. Then appearances increase and become connected with conceptual mind, and that causes them to be seen as sensory objects. This is appearance, increase, and attainment. Thus, those appearances arise solely as dependent origination from the power of the continuous presence of the seeds of consciousnesses, faculties, and objects within the alaya. From the Vajra Pinnacle: The alaya, which has all seeds, is said to be the identity of the internal and the external.356 As fo r the order in which appearances arise: The activity of mental events cre­ates a mentation that cognizes the six sensory objects; this creates the con­sciousnesses that perceive those objects; which causes thoughts of acquisition and sensations of happiness, thoughts of rejection and sensations ·of suffer­ing, and neutral states in which sensations are neither [pleasant nor unpleas­ant]; this then results in identifications that fixate on concepts concerning those objects; which establishes the propensity to conceive sensory objects as \"other\"; which solidifies into the creation of aggregates of fo rm. Thus, phenomena appear through the power of the mind without ever being a part of the actual nature of the mind, so it's impossible that they can exist. However, when the mind doesn't understand this, it is deluded, perceiv­ing itself as a sensory object. This ignorance means that there is no realization of baseless, sourceless, self-knowing, and the perceiver of objects is mistaken fo r a self. For that reason, any phenomenon that is a perceiver or is perceived is nothing but an illusion. The basis of these illusions is the mind. Therefore, they don't even have an atom that exists apart from the mind. They are empty. They are like the apparitions of horses and elephants conjured up by magic, which have no existence separate from their emptiness. When did the mind sink into delusion? (135] No such time can be estab­lished, because the very appearance of time itself is an illusion, a concep­tual embellishment without any existence whatsoever. Nevertheless, it's described that we have been deluded for as long as we have not known ourselves, which has been throughout beginningless time.

The alaya creates mentation (manas). Mentation creates the six engag­ing consciousnesses. The mentation then stores in the alaya the propensi­ties accrued from sensory experiences, fo rming an unceasing continuity of dependent origination in the fo rm of interrelated causes and conditions. [ 136] Therefore, in the alaya there is an unceasing latent continuity, like a Rowing river, until buddhahood is attained. That is why [Vasubandhu] wrote: It continues like the Row of a river. It ceases in the state of an arhat.361 From the Entry into Lanka Sutra: The mind (citta) has a nature of clarity. Mentation (manas) is that which pollutes it. Mentation and consciousnesses together continuously create propensities.362 Also from the En try into Lanka Sutra: Mentation arises from the alaya. Consciousnesses arise from mentation. All minds also, like waves, arise from the alaya.363 In the same way, the constant continuum of the twelve stages of dependent orig­ination arises from a constant continuum of seeds. There is the ignorance that has been described, the grasping at sensations, and the increase of that grasping until there is acquisition of the yearned-for object of desire. Those three afflic­tions create the karma fo r creation and becoming. From them arise the mass of suffering of these seven: [ ( 1) consciousness,] ( 2) name and form, ( 3) the six bases, ( 4) contact, ( s) sensation, ( 6) birth, and ( 7) death.

The necessity of knowing the hidden fa ult of delusion: As long as you do not know this essential meaning of delusion, you will not see delusion to be delu­sion. If you cannot see delusion as delusion, you will be unable to eliminate delusion. Therefore [Rangjung Dorje] prayed in this way to teach the great importance of knowing this essential meaning. The implied teaching on the first line of the verse on the view that cuts through doubts concerning the basis: ':All phenomena are manifestations of the mind\" THE IMPLIED MEANING The evident teaching that the phenomena of samsara are mental appearances enables us to understand the subtler teaching that all phenomena of nirvana are also mental appearances. We are so strongly habituated to the propen­sity to see things as solid, the obvious appearances of existing things seem extremely contrary to the nature of the mind, which makes it difficult to comprehend that they are the mind. If we can comprehend that, then it isn't difficult to understand that the phenomena of enlightenment [are mind], because they correspond to the true nature of mind. [ 13 7] Therefore, this verse also teaches the phenomena of enlightenment to be nothing other than the nature of pure mind. When the mind is stained, it is \"mind;' \"mentation:· and \"consciousness.\" When it is stainless, these three are the three kayas.

When purified of all stains, all the qualities of the basis will appear. This can be learned in detail in the Sublime Continuum. However, Acarya Candrakirti teaches that the mind ceases on the attain­ment of enlightenment: Through burning all the dry firewood that is phenomena, there is the dharmakaya of the conquerors. At that time there is neither birth nor cessation. Through the cessation of the mind, the [dharma] kay a manifests. ?>b6 Why does Candrakirti say this? He is saying that the mind that is mind, mentation, and consciousness is eliminated, but that the pure mind is the great bliss of the dharmadhatu, which is free of cessation and abiding. Omni­scient wisdom is also nothing other than the dharmadhatu and therefore completely transcends the phenomena of the impure mind. Because the phe­nomena of enlightenment are nothing other than the pure mind, pupils will perceive the appearance of the nirma.Q.a[kaya] or sarpbhoga[kaya] according to whether their minds are slightly or mostly purified. Thus, the evident meaning and the implied meaning of this teaching establish that all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are your own mind.

The consciousnesses' objects of perception have no external existence whatsoever.367 Also from the Vajra Tent Ta ntra: The mind, because it is as pure as space, is a mind of pure, perfect bliss.

From Entering the Conduct of a Bodhisattt1a: In the fo rests, the deer, the birds, and the trees don't speak unpleasant words. I will live among those whom it is pleasant to be with. I will go without a care and, without looking back, dwell in an empty temple, at the foot of a tree, or in caves. Once I am living in a naturally expansive place that I do not see as being mine, I will be free and without attachment.403 Therefore, dwell in a solitary place, go through the stages [of practice], and train the mind well in the general preliminaries. When you rely on this exter­nal solitude and train the mind in the general preliminaries, all your preoccu­pations will naturally cease. This is described by Acarya Avadhiitipada: Kapila, a heron, and a snake, a hunter of deer in the fo rest, an arrow maker, and a maiden: Those six are my teachers.104 [Also from this text]: Being without longings, possessions, and home, being habituated to the solitude of the fo rest, maintaining a firm fo cus and remaining in solitude: That is what I have learned from my gurus. -1us Danasila has explained the meaning of [these verses] .\"106 Once a woman named Kapila arranged to meet a man at a certain time.

As the hunter was used to being in the fo rest, eventually he became a meditator, too. When Avadhutipada witnessed this, he learned that he should be fa m iliar with solitude.

[149] Therefore, [the meditation] is just to naturally rest in an uncontrived, nat­ural state. The way that this is done, according to those who know the prac­tice instructions of our Kagyii lineage, is as follows: Do not investigate the past and do not greet the future, but let your consciousness be what it is, without modification.419 According to Lord Gampopa: \"Do not investigate the past\" means that our minds should not fo llow previous thoughts. \"Do not greet the future\" means that our minds should not greet subsequent thoughts. \"Perfectly rest­ing in the natural, present consciousness\" means not focusing on anything in the present. If the mind is not altered, it will become clear, just as undisturbed water becomes clear. Therefore perfectly rest in an unaltered state, just as it is.420 As [ Gampopa] describes, the meaning of the preceding quotations is that you cannot meditate using any thought created by your conceptual mind. [The meditation] is accomplished through fo llowing the wonderful, secret essential point that is the instruction not to engage in conceptual elabora­tions of the past, present, or future.

Accord­ing to Prajiiakaramati in his Commentary on Diffi cult Points in uEntering the Conduct of a Bodhisattva\": Thus, this absence of an own nature is present as the natural ulti­mate fo rm of all things. For an individual's supreme goal, that itself is considered to be the superior, supreme, special goal.

[Iso] However, you may object that this still means [mahamudra] is subject to that criticism because thoughts of the three times naturally cease when maintaining the present, unaltered consciousness. If you say that, you must be someone who can't let go of your thoughts because you're too attached to them. There appear to be plenty of other people who hold such pure views as yours, so why not just enjoy your thoughts along with them and stop analyzing our view. We aren't fo llowing any other path than that taught by the Tathagata and fo llowed by the siddha lords.

Should we practice maintaining an uncontrived natural state right from the beginning? That depends on your own individual level. If you can, that is extremely excellent, but if you can't, then with the rope of mindfulness you must tie the elephant of your mind to the pillar that is the object of your meditation. Everyone who knows the instructions teaches this. Therefore, we have the [two] categories of [meditation] with the mind fo cused out­ward and with the mind fo cused inward. Each of those categories is then divided into evident and subtle practices. Thus, there are practices that are based upon anything the mind can fo cus on, such as a statue of a deity, a round spot (hindu), a syllable, or the breath.

We can categorize thoughts into two kinds: obvious and subtle. The obvious are simply the mind's observation of an object. [ 153] Subtle [thoughts] are the examination of that observation. From Tr e,lSur_y o_( the Abhidharma: ... obvious observation and subtle examination. ·\"11 However, in terms of practice instruction, the obvious thoughts are the thoughts and examination of a subject that we are clearly aware of, while subtle thoughts are those that engage with a subject without our being aware of them. The \"waves\" of the mental activity of evident and subtle thoughts are not forcibly stopped but naturally cease, so that they cease by themselves. The alaya consciousness, which is the flow of\"the river of the mind;' also becomes undisturbed and naturally calm. [Rangjung Dorje] prays fo r an \"untroubled, peaceful sea of samatha, free from all polluting impurities:· such as \"dullness and agitation.\" This is the poetic device called embodiment.439 Here, \"dullness and agitation\" represent all obstacles to samatha, which must be eliminated. From [Nagarjuna's] Let­ter to a Fri end: Agitation and regret, malice, stupor and sleepiness. desire, and doubt: The Sage taught that those five are thieves who steal the wealth of meditation's virtues.440 Therefore, the obstacles [to samatha] are of five kinds: (r) agitation and regret, (2) malice, (3) sleepiness and stupor, (4) desire, and (s) doubt. Agi­tation is the movement of thoughts toward a variety of subjects, and regret concerns inappropriate actions. Both of these prevent the development of samatha. Malice prevents being in a state of happiness. Dullness clouds the mind and develops into stupor and sleepiness, which prevent states of clarity. Desire for people and things prevents the mind from being useful. Doubt, such as wondering whether samadhi is even possible, prevents a one-pointed state. All five obstacles can be summarized into the two categories of dullness and agitation: dullness, stupor, and sleepiness fo rm the category of dullness, and all the other obstacles fo rm the category of agitation."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"2.42.

[ 154] It is crucially necessary as the fo undation fo r vipasyana. According to Santideva: Know that samatha perfectly conjoined with vipasyana defeats the affiictions. But samatha should be sought first, without attachment to the world, and with delight.442 The SUtras teach these Categories of samatha: (1) nine different aspects of engaging in samatha called the nine methods of stabilizing the mind; 443 ( 2.) the seven attentions,444 which are called \"preparations\" because you have to apply yourself to them in order to attain real dhyana; ( 3) the fo ur real dhyanas­that is, the first dhyana and so on; (4) the fo ur fo rmless samadhis; and (s) the equanimity of cessation.+�s The dhyanas, the fo rmless [samadhis], and the equanimity of cessation are known collectively as the nine concentrations:146 These nine methods of resting the mind are in the Perfection ofWisdom:'147 (1) resting the mind in equanimity, (2) truly resting the mind, (3) completely resting the mind, (4) subjugation, (s) true subjugation, (6) pacification, (7) true pacification, (8) singleness, and (9) samadhi. The seven contemplations, fr om Ornament ofthe Nlahayana Sutras: Then first, chat devotee, in examining the meaning of nondualicy, the Dharma of the sucras, and so on, memorizes the names of the sutras, and so on.

Having understood those meanings, he should also bring them together in the Dharma. Then, he should make an aspiration to attain that meaning.

The path of samatha that is to be known: The Dharma and its inclusive terms.'148 Thus, there are seven mental engagements: (x) the aspiration toward specific knowledge, (2) solitude, (3) joy, (4) unification, (s) analysis, (6) application to the conclusion, and ( 7) the result of application to the conclusion.

Those are when identification of fo rm has ceased and there is increasingly subtler meditation. The equanimity of cessation is when suffering and sensations cease. No one other than sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, arhants, or bodhisattvas can enter this state. The stability gained through the nine methods of stabilizing the mind is purely samatha, while the others are conjoined with vipasyana. You might object that this is incorrect, because vipasyana is taught to be supramundane wisdom while all the concentrations aside fr om the equanimity of cessation are mundane and the general path. But this is not incorrect, because mere mun­dane wisdom is also called vipasyana, even though this [prayer], fr om the very beginning, is teaching the special ( vipasyana] that is supramundane.

There are those who claim that even a higher level of medita­tion should still have examination and analysis, but they are transforming the Buddhist tradition into a non-Buddhist one, fo r no genuine Buddhist tradi­tion teaches that meditation requires thought. In our tradition, all agree that the vipasyana that is analysis through wisdom is that of the post-meditation stage.

The Sanskrit term fo r [nonattention] is amanasikara.4M The syllable a [161] indicates the emptiness that transcends all conceptual elaborations, such as \"selfless\" and \"birthless.\" The rest of the word teaches that the mind (manas) has the atten­tion that is free of attention and that has no attachment even to emptiness. Thus th is establishes the mahamudra that is a union fr ee fr om extremes. Reci­tation of{Manjuirzs} Names says: A is the supreme of all syllables, It is the sacred syllable that has great meaning.

They are com­pletely eliminated through nonattention.469 According to Acarya Maitripa: Amanasikara has the a syllable (a-kara) as the primary member [of the compound], and like iaka-parthiva (\"vegetarian king\"), [amanasikara] is a compound that omits the middle word:1�0"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"l54 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions And also: Alternatively, a is the word fo r luminosity, while attention ( manasikdra) is the word fo r self-blessing.

Mahd (\"great;' Tib. chen po) means that there is no Dharma that is higher than it; or it means that it is superior to the action seal, the Dharma seal, and the commitment seal. Therefore because it is both a seal and great, [mahdmudrd] is a con­junction of [two] words with the same basis. [163] According to Acarya VajrapaQi: The essence of mahamudra is \"nondeviation;' and that is why it is called a \"seal.\" For example, just as ministers, minor kings, and so on cannot deviate fr om the command with the seal of author­ity of a great universal sovereign (cakravartin ), in the same way the entire variation of inner and outer phenomena do not deviate fr om the essence of the union, do not deviate fr om naturally pres­ent wisdom, do not deviate from the mahamudra. That is why it is a seal. Mahd means it is great, because it is the essence of the action seal, Dharma seal, and commitment seai.·m According to Acarya Ramapala: It is both a seal and great because it seals the three mudras.��� From Lotus Endowed: A Commentar_y on Difficult Points: Mahamudra is the perfection of wisdom that has given birth"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Oral Transmission of the Supreme Siddhas l.SS to all the tathagatas who have ever been, who are yet to come, and who exist in the present.

Moreover, as in the quotation from Kalacakrapada's oral transmission given above, the Kalacakra instructions teach infinite ways to accomplish mahamudra through any of the three mudras, depending on the level of your abilities. Therefore, in our tradition, solely within the innate union (Jahaja_yoga) instructions taught by Dakpo Lhaje, there are supplementary instructions on the different kinds of teachings to be given according to the teacher's powers and the pupil's level of capability. Among these, there is the approach of teach­ing the Mantrayana to pupils who are not vessels fo r the special Mantrayana teachings but are of either the definite or uncertain general Mahayana family.

Then special blessing and a direct introduction [to the mind] will cause them to gain the supreme accomplishment of mahamudra. It is evident that some Indian scholars also taught that mahamudra is the Perfection Ve hicle's wisdom of union, because both sides of the argument are given in Sahajavajra's Commentary on \"Ten Verses on the True Nature.\" Some have said that mahamudra is the wisdom of the true nature: The supreme yoga is meditation on the union of method and wisdom.

This is called union because in the meditation of the individual with that realization, there is no separate fo cus on a yoga of either samatha or vipasyana. You develop this genuine vipasyana wisdom fo r the first time on the supreme Dharma stage of the path of accumulation, and as you prog­ress higher, it becomes clearer and more stable. From this point on, the true union of samatha and vipasyana has appeared. According to the Perfection Vehicle, until the meditation and post­meditation phases have blended, the post-accomplishment wisdom will ana­lyze, while meditation will be one-pointed without thoughts about a meaning that is being analyzed. [ 16 6] After the meditation and post-meditation phases have blended, the conceptual elaboration of there being an analyzer and an analyzed will cease, and naturally present wisdom will effortlessly know the true nature of phenomena. Therefore, you must understand that an examin­ing and analyzing wisdom is simply an aspect of\"analytic vipasyana\" and not true vipasyana, even though it's called vipasyand. You must know that the union of samatha and vipasyana that occurs before you attain the true yoga of union is merely this \" [analytic] vipasyana.\" Some think that vipasyana is the wisdom that perfectly distinguishes phe­nomena and therefore does not transcend examination and analysis while samatha is without examination or analysis. The holders of such a view can­not agree with this teaching of their union. Others say that their union has examination and analysis that is never apart fr om the elixir of samatha, like a clear lake, unruffled by wind, through which little fish move.

Therefore, when you analyze phenomena with an analysis that accords with wisdom, even the knowledge that nothing is seen ceases within that nature. That is the expe­rience of self-knowing, with no duality of subject and object.

Analytic meditation is taught in the Madhyamaka stages of meditation so that we can attain the unattained wisdom of vipasyana, but it is contradic­tory and pointless after that meditation has been attained.

Objectless compas­sion comes when you see the meaning of the true nature, when there is \"emp­tiness that has compassion as its essence.\" The compassion that is taught here is this third compassion. What is objectless compassion? As taught in the verse, \"The nature of beings is always buddhahood,\" which is present as the essence of the Bud­dha's dharmakaya. But solely because they do not realize that, beings wan­der in endless samsara, drowning in a limitless ocean of suffering. When you see the meaning of the true nature, you have the effortless appearance of an uninterrupted continuum of overwhelming compassion fo r those beings. It's said: The bodhisattva who has mastered fa miliarization with meditation develops compassion particularly fo r those in the grasp of the demon ofbdief in reality.s04 According to Nagarjuna: Thus if the yogin meditates on this emptiness, there will undoubtedly arise a mind devoted to the benefit of others. �u' Because of this compassion, bodhisattvas are dedicated solely to the ben­efit of others. Therefore, they take on existences that specifically accord with"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"that of all beings. They do not abandon samsara, and yet thev are unstained . . by its fa ults. [Also accordi ng to Nagarjuna]: When those who have stability in meditation are startled by the sufferings of others, they will abandon the bliss of the meditative state and even enter the Avid hell. This is what is wonderful; this is what is praiseworthy; this is the supreme way of the sublime ones. It's not their giving away their bodies and wealth that is marvelous. To depend on karma and its results even though you know phenomena are empty is more marvelous than marvelous, more wonderful than wonderful. Those who wish to protect beings are born within the swamp of existence and yet are unstained by its faults, like the petals of a lotus on the water. 506 The word \"may\" [in verse 22] makes the prayer that this will be so. [175] Ho w compassion is united with emptiness [Verse 23] When there is love with the unceasing power of overwhelming compassion, the meaning of the empty essence appears nakedly. May I meditate inseparably, day and night, on the union, the supreme path, which is free from error. The power of objectless compassion arises unceasingly.

Therefore, the path of union, which is the blending of empti­ness and compassion into one-taste, is \"the supreme path, which is fr ee fr om error.\" From the Binding Net of the l)dkinis: The Buddha, the Dharma, and also the Sangha, were taught so that the mind might realize the inseparability of emptiness and compassion.507 From the Vajra Pinnacle: Dividing emptiness from compassion is like dividing a lamp's flame fr om its light. Emptiness and compassion are one, just like a lamp's flame and its light.508 This is the meaning ofbodhicitta and of the perfection of wisdom teachings, too. According to Ears of Grain of Practice Instructions: Here, the inseparability of emptiness and compassion, the unlo­cated mind, means bodhicitta and the perfection of wisdom.509 If wisdom and emptiness are not united, then you are practicing only one aspect and will be unable to attain the unsurpassable state. If you are unable to do that, then this will not be the vajra yoga. From the Guhyasamdja Tantra: Yoga is not the way of method; it is also not wisdom alone. The union of method and wisdom­that is what the Tathagata named_yoga.�10 From the Hevajra Ta ntra : Because method is creation, and wisdom, which ends existence, is destruction.�11 From the Sutra Requested b_y the Ndga King A1111tJatapata:"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Q,·al TransmisJion of thr Suprtmr Siddhas 171 Mara has two activities: method devoid of wisdom and wisdom devoid of method.

Through compassion, you will not remain in peace.st·l This teaches that you must have the union of method and wisdom in order to attain the nirvana that remains neither in existence nor peace. There are count­less such teachings. Also, if you have compassion without the realization of emptiness, yo.u may be proud of benefiting others. Then not only will you fail to benefit them, but also your own practice will be swept away by a wind, and you will be prevented from benefiting others for some time. If you meditate on emptiness alone, you will go astray onto the path of the sravakas and pratyeka­buddhas, which will be a long-term obstacle to benefiting others. It is said: Going to hell is not a lasting obstacle to enlightenment. Becoming a sravaka or pratyekabuddha is a lasting obstacle to the attainment of enlightenment. SIS As this is most certainly the case, this would be an error on the path of the Mahayana. Therefore, [Rangjung Dorje] taught in the fo rm of a prayer that we must meditate inseparably, day and night, which means all the time, on this path of union that is free from error until we have reached the state of union, the state of great Vajradhara.

Therefore, the first results are \"sight and clairvoyance.\" There are five sights and six clairvoyances. The five sights are physical sight, divine sight, wisdom sight, Dharma sight, and buddha sight. PHYSICAL SIGHT From a sutra:"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Oral TranJmiJsion of the Sup,·n1u Siddhas l?S The physical vision of a bodhisattva sees fo r a hundred _yo Janas or more, seeing as far as every world in the universe.�21 DIVINE SIGHT Bodhisattvas have perfect knowledge of the divine sight of devas, from those in the heavens of the Four Great Kings up to the devas in Akanigha. However, those devas do not know the divine sight ofbodhisatrvas. sB It is taught that with divine sight one can, in particular, see the deaths and rebirths of all beings in the ten directions. WISDOM SIGHT This is the wisdom that realizes selflessness. DHARMA SIGHT According to Acarya Vasubandhu, this is comprised of nine strengths, which are the ten strengths with the omission of the knowledge of what is possible and impossible.

The divine sight in this list of clairvoyances is not the same as that in the list of five sights, because that divine sight comes from the ripening of karma while this [divine sight] comes fr om meditation. You might ask, \"If it's taught that the sights and clairvoyances arise while we're still on the path, how can they be called special qualities of buddha­hood?\" This is answered in Abhayakara's Adornment if[ Sdkyamuni's] View: Whichever path one is on, fr om that of accumulation and through higher and higher levels of mind, there is attainment of each suc­cessive development of the five sights in such particular fo rms as supreme, perftctly supreme, and so on, and there are also the six clairvoyances. 52, Also [from Abhayakara's Adornment if Sdkyamuni's View]: If you ask, \"How can bodhisattvas have a buddha's five sights and six clairvoyances?\" the answer is that bodhisattvas acquire both of these separately on the eighth stage, but at the stage of buddha­hood they are totally perfected, totally purified, and in their ulti­mate fo rm.m Therefore, as described, the sights and clairvoyances become completely pure and attain their ultimate fo rm at the level ofbuddhahood, where one is able to perceive all things without limitation and so on.

[18o] Ripening beings is described in Ornament �(the Mahayana Sutras. First it's taught that bodhisatrvas must ripen themselves through the nine charac­teristics of ripening. In conclusion it states: Just as one declares a wound or fo od is ripened when it has suppurated or is ready to be enjoyed, in the same way, it is taught that the [individual as a] basis must have ripened the two aspects of pacification and application. It is taught that beings526 are ripened through separation [from obscurations], and similarly, totally ripened, perfectly ripened, harmoniously ripened, excellently ripened, ripened with realization, constantly ripened, and ripened higher.527 The teaching continues in detail. For example, a wound is ripened so that it will heal, and food is ripened so that it will be edible, while pupils are ripened so that they can eliminate faults and create remedies. Ripening is categorized into those eight different kinds beginning with \"ripening through separa­tion,\" but I will not describe them here.

The seven aspects of purification are general purifi­cation, the purification of power, the purification of perfect enjoyment, the purification ofbeings, the purification of causes, the purification of results.531 I am not going into these in detail; they can be learned from such texts as the Sutra of the Ten Stages. 1he fulfillment of the pray ers for accomplishing the phenomena ofbuddhahood The sutras teach ten kinds of prayers. Each of those is made up of countless trillions of prayers. When they are fu lfilled, the qualities ofbuddhahood are completely perfected. Buddhas perceive the buddha qualities, but even high bodhisattvas can only give a vague indication of what they are. Therefore, [ordinary] beings who have childlike minds can never comprehend them. Nevertheless, the sutras and treatises describe countless classifications, such as: (1) a single dharmakaya that is comprised of all the kayas, wisdoms, qualities, and activities; [181] (2) two kayas: the dharmakaya and fo rm kaya; (3) three kayas, with the fo rm kaya divided into two; (4) fo ur kayas, with the addition of the svabhavakaya; and (s) five kayas, which are the embodiment of the five wisdoms. In terms of wisdom there are, fo r example, the two wisdoms-the knowl­edge of the true nature and the knowledge of the diverse apparent nature of things-and the jive wisdoms-mirror-like wisdom and so on. There are countless classifications of kayas and pupils. The classifications of qualities are similarly countless, including the sixty-four qualities of ripening and lib­eration. Activity has countless classifications, starting with two: naturally present activity and uninterrupted, continuous activity. Learn these exactly as they appear in the sutras, tantras, and treatises. The word buddha can mean both \"awakened\" (sangs pa) and \"blossomed\" (rgyas pa),m hence the (Tibetan] name sangs rgyas.

Yo u attain genu­ine vipa5yana, which is the wisdom that is the union of emptiness and compassion. Therefore, you truly obtain the yoga of samatha and . , -v1pasyana. 3· [The yoga of] one taste: As you become increasingly adept, all phe­nomena are realized to be the \"manifold that has one taste,\" and there is unceasing, effortless wisdom. 4. The yoga of nonmeditation: The luminosity of meditation and the luminosity of the basis blend into one, so that all obscurations that conceal the true nature are completely purified away.

You can learn fr om the teachings of the previous great masters the details of this classification and the manner in which the qualities develop. In terms of the yogas' equivalence with the paths and stages of the Per­fe ction Vehicle, it is taught-and it is true-that: (1) One-pointedness is equivalent to the path of accumulation. (2.) The lesser and medium levels of nonelaboration are equivalent to the path of engagement. (3) The greater level of nonelaboration is equivalent to the path of seeing. ( 4) The yoga of one taste and the lesser and medium levels of the yoga of nonmeditation are equivalent to the path of meditation. (s) The great level of nonmeditation is taught to be the level ofbuddhahood. From Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras: The bodhisattva, having excellently gathered an infinite, perfect accumulation of merit and wisdom, because of his contemplation's complete certainty in phenomena, understands the nature of meaning and the process of speech. He also knows those meanings to be only speech, and as in that way they exist as mind alone, he has the direct realization of the dharmadhatu (the nature of phenomena) as being fr ee of the characteristics of dualism. 538 Also fr om Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras: The wise, through the power of nonconceptual wisdom, are always completely in a state of equanimity, so that a thick accumulation of fa ults present in them is eliminated, as is venom by a great poison [as an antidote]. One who dwdls perfectly in the Dharmas taught by the Sage [183] rests his understanding in its root, the dharmadhatu (the nature of phenomena).

However, [in the fo ur yo gas] does one actually obtain the powerful qual­ities of each individual path, such as receiving instructions directly from nirmiQ.akaya buddhas and using miraculous powers to travel to many worlds as one would obtain on the greater path of accumulation? When you have correctly fo llowed the path of realizing the meaning of the true nature, it's impossible fo r the qualities that are signs of the path, like heat is fo r fire, to not appear, but they do differ as to whether they appear as a common per­ception fo r all beings or not. It is also taught that when the result is attained within one lifetime, the karmic body will obscure [those qualities] to some degree until the karmic body transforms into the wisdom body. When you meditate on the Mantrayana's completion stages, such as the six branch yogas, this is essentially the same as going through the paths and stages. Gyalwa Rangjung [Dor je] has stated in his Profound In ner Meaning: First, there is receiving empowerment and the generation and completion stages; perfectly understanding them and practicing with aspiration is the path of accumulation. Knowing the essential meaning of the channels, winds, and drops, performing \"perfectly excellent activiti' and attaining \"heat\" is to be on the path of engagement. Then to traverse the path of engagement through vrata conduct so as to unite with [the path of] seeing: that is withdrawal541 and the path with fo ur dhyanas, which is also called the purification of th e channels.

Nonmeditation is the fo urth [empowerment].544 [184] According to Naropa: The first mahamudra realization is turning away fr om the ignorance that views extrinsic thoughts as true. Realizing knowledge to be clarity without fixation is called the knowledge empowerment. If the five poisons become the five wisdoms, it is said to be the vase empowerment. When its unimpeded power arises without limitation, bliss will arise from emptiness, and this is called the empowerment of the second cla rity. The wisdom that is connate is the inseparability of bliss and emptiness, the nature of space. In the great one-taste of union, appearances and mind are experienced as great bliss.

[185] Although there are those who say that the noncomposite dharmadhatu is not a good action, according to our tradition this is stated clearly many times in the last turning of the Dharma wheel. For example : Virtue is the nature of the alaya.547 Therefore, although [the alaya] isn't a good action fr om the categories of composite good or bad actions, it has the power to enable the emergence of all the phenomena of enlightenment and virtue.

I have now concluded my rudimentary explanation, which was limited by the extent of my intellect's powers, of the stages in Prayer for the Definitive Meaning, the Mahamudrd. Now I will add two brief supplements: I. Synonyms fo r the practice of mahamudra instructions 2.. The succession of gurus in the mahamudra lineages Sy nonyms for the practice of mahdmudrd instructions Previously, there was only a brief reference made to these two kinds (of mahamudra practice]: I. The special Mantrayana tradition 2.. A merger ofMantrayana and Sutrayana realization The special Ma ntraydna tradition of mahdmudrd If the master has the power and the pupil has the ideal capability, there will be no need fo r preliminary elaborate empowerments but only the vajra-wisdom empowerment. Pupils with less capability must first receive the elaborate empowerments. The first of these two approaches is fo r the \"immediate\" individual, who attains liberation solely through being blessed, shown a symbol, or given a little instruction, as in the accounts of Indian masters who attained siddhi. In particular, there are many accounts of that kind of liberation occurring within our own lineage in Tibet. In these cases, it is not a definite necessity fo r all the stages of instructions to be taught. This approach is that of the second of Milarepa's two lineages, those of ( 1) the elaborate path of methods and ( 2.) the unelaborated path of innate UniOn. As fo r individuals who progress through stages, according to Rangjung Dorje in his teaching on preliminaries in Instructions for the Mahamudrd Innate Union: [186) A true guru with the necessary qualities only gives this teaching to pupils who practice properly, have abandoned the activities of this life, and are intent on unsurpassable enlightenment.

Then [the guru] gives them empowerments that completely ripen them. Then they should practice in a pleasant and solitary place.�\"8 Thus, there is this definite procedure fo r the practice of the lineage. As fo r the preliminary ripening [empowerment], although it could be fo r any deity in the highest yoga tantras, it appears that in practice the empowerment is fo r the mandala of Cakrasarrwara and consort. Also, Mahasiddha Lodro Rinchen '\"'\"9 taught that there should be the reading transmission fo r the Vtlj ra Verses of the Aural Ta ntra,�so and this is given. There are two traditions fo r how these instructions are given: 1. As soon as the empowerment fo r the instructions is given, [the pupils] practice the generation stage. Once they have mastered that, they practice the yoga without attributes. 2.. First, [the pupils] master to some extent the samatha and vipasyana yoga without attributes, and then they practice the generation stage. This makes it easier to attain clear appearances and quickly attain siddhis. In both approaches, however, the generation stage is fo llowed by the comple­tion stage, either with or without attributes, and they are practiced together as they will enhance each other. 1he merger of the Ma ntraydna and Sutraydna traditions Lord Maitripa created this tradition by emphasizing certain aspects in the teaching of Saraha's lineage. Advayavajra551 taught this in his text named Ten Verses on the Tr ue Na ture. Dakpo Rinpoche [i.e., Gampopa] then adorned this tradition with Atisa's teaching on the graduated path fo r three kinds of individuals. Dakpo Rinpoche received that teaching fr om many Kadampa lamas, such as Geshe Chakriwa, Nyukrumpa, Gya Yondak, and Jayiilpa. [Dakpo Rinpoche's tradition] is known as the merger of the two great rivers of the Kadam and mahamudra traditions. However, there is nothing in [Dakpo Rinpoche's tradition) that is different, in terms of either words or meaning, fr om the \"instructions on the innate union of nonmeditation,\" which therefore brings a swift attainment of the mahamudra siddhi. Accord­ing to Dakpo Rinpoche:"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"2.86 Ma hdmudrd and Related Instructions I have benefited many beings through the Kadam Dharma, in accordance with my dream-omens and with prophecies given by Milarepa.m [187] Dakpo Rinpoche also said: I have now been able to benefit beings a little, and that is because of the kindness of the Kadampa lamas.553 [Dakpo Rinpoche] dreamed that he beat a drum, many deer came to listen to him, he fe d them milk, and so on, all of which referred to these instruc­tions. The view of our tradition is that there are very fe w who are worthy of the special Vajrayana in this time of great degeneration, but by teaching the graduated path fo r the three kinds of individuals to pupils with dull abilities and inferior capability, they will become beings perfectly worthy to be vessels fo r the special Mantrayana and will achieve liberation within one lifetime. Even if they don't, many of them will see the meaning of the mahamudra and reach the path that is irreversible. Since the time of Venerable [Dakpo Rinpoche] up to the present, there has been this tradition of giving instruc­tions to guide all pupils, without discrimination, whether they are of high or low capacity. Teaching the Mantrayana's profound path of methods to worthy pupils is called the causal-phase teaching or foundation instructions.

The succession of gurus in the mahdmudrd lineages According to the special Mantrayana tradition, one lineage is: (I) Vaj radhara, (2) Tilopa, (3) Naropa, and (4) Marpa Lotsawa.

Afterward, both lineages merge in Lord Mila­repa, Lord Dao Shonu [i.e., Gampopa], and so on. This is the lineage of the Kamtsang [Kagyii].557 This tradition of blending the understanding of the Siitrayana and Mantrayana is solely the river of the second lineage, which has its origin in Saraha. The graduated path of the three levels of beings, which is an adornment [for the mahamudra], is of three lineages: I. The lineage of vast conduct 2. The lineage of the profound view 3.

In order to reveal this, the conquerors teach countless, specific aspects or vehicles of the Dharma, within which there are as many different teachings and instructions as there are different aspirations and capabilities among pupils. This is the special, marvelous power of the compassionate activity of the buddhas. Supreme among these teachings is mahamudra, which is as fa mous as the sun and moon.

Their nature is with­out aspect or division, unstained by such terms as happiness or suffering, is or isn't, existent or nonexistent, eternalism or nihilism, self or other. Therefore, it is fr ee fr om all extremes of[conceptual] embellishment and has no existent essence. The key point is that it is the basis fo r any kind of appearance or char­acteristic to arise, but that whatever appears has no real existence. This noncomposite dharmadhatu, the great emptiness fr ee fr om the three extremes of arising, remaining, and ceasing, has primordially been the natu­rally present three kayas. This is the basis, the true nature of things, which is called mahdmudrd . It is said in the Secret Essence [ Tantra]: This mind, which is without root or basis, is the root of all phenomena. 564 It is not like that in just one individual or in the mind continuum of just one buddha; it is the all-pervading basis fo r the entirety of all appearances and beings, all of samsara and nirvana. Those who realize or know this true nature or identity are called buddhas. Those who do not realize or know it are deluded and are called beings. This is the basis fo r wandering in samsara. Therefore, it is known as the basis ofsam­sara and nirvana. The Great Brahman Saraha has said: The mind alone is the seed of all. Samsara and nirvana emanate fr om it. �6s . Thus, there is one essence with different aspects, and these aspects appear simply as a result of it being realized or not. However, the essence of these"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"1he Brigh t To rch 2.91 two aspects is the great primordial inseparability of the three kayas, which is never polluted by fa ults such as [the duality of] good and bad, or change. Within the general vehicles this is called the ch,zngeless ,zbsolute.�66 This is the true nature of the primordial basis. [ 19 3] The true nature as a neutral impartiality, neither realized nor unrealized, is called the dla_ya (\"basis of everything\") because it is the basis of both sam­sara and nirvana. The alaya is not a total emptiness in which there is nothing. Rather, like a mirror and its clarity, there is an unimpeded self-illuminating knowing, which is called the ala_ya consciousness. THE WAY IN WHICH SAMSARA AND NIRVANA ARISE SEPARATELY FROM THIS SINGLE ALAYA The knowing or wisdom aspect of self-illuminating cognition is the essence of the knowing that is an inseparability of the essence, which is emptiness, and the nature, which is clarity. It is the seed, or cause, of all the qualities of buddhahood and all the Dharmas of the true path. Therefore, all the syn­onyms fo r nirvana correspond to it, such as the true alaya, buddha nature, self-knowing, dharmakaya, perfection of wisdom, the buddhahood of one's own mind, and so on. This is what practitioners of the path have to directly perceive and recognize. Alternatively, the dullness aspect of the neutral alaya is not knowing one­self, that is to say, obscuring oneself through not knowing one's true nature. This is called innate ign orance, the great darkn ess of beginningless time, and also the alaya of diverse propensities, as all afflictions and deluded thoughts arise because of it. It is the basis fo r the delusion of all beings. It is said in the Ta ntra of the Un impeded View: When knowing does not arise in the basis there is a dull mindlessness. This is the cause of ignorance and delusion.567 Accompanying this ignorance, as a· kind of retinue, are the seven kinds of thought that arise fr om ignorance, such as medium attachment and fo rgetfulness. The conception of an \"I\" or self arises fr om that innate ignorance, and that causes the conception of others in relation to the self. Appearances com­ing from you are not recognized to be coming fr om you but are conceived of as external objects. That is how delusion begins: by not recognizing the"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"292 Mahdmudrd and Rela ted Instructions concepts of subject and object fo r what they are. This is conceptual igno­ra nce. It is also called mental consciousness. It is the deluded mind that cre­ates the separation between mind and objects. It has a retinue of fo rty kinds of thoughts, such as craving and grasping, that arise from desire. [ 19 4] This mental consciousness has the power to create and multiply a variety of pro­pensities and delusions. It is aided by karmic wind as a pervasive condition and the alaya's causal ignorance. The developing power of fa ctors of depen­dent origination such as these-the triad of body, appearances, and mind­are completely created. The arising of separate five sense consciousnesses and the thoughts and perceptions of all six sense consciousnesses is what is called the dependent. 568 The five major root winds, the five minor branch winds, and the rest serve as steeds fo r thoughts. At the same time habituation to being fixated on delu­sion causes the appearances that come from yourself to appear to be the world and its inhabitants. Thus this fo rms both the fo undational basis and its object and gives rise to everything. This is what is called the a.ffl icted mind. It is also called the consciousnesses of the jive senses, because it creates attachment and so on through each of the five sensory organs. This is accompanied by thirty-three thoughts that arise from anger, such as medium nonattachment.5691he alaya and its diverse propensities are the roots, and the eighty kinds of thoughts have the nature of being branches. This is a sequential development that fo rms the unbroken continuum of delusion that causes you to wander endlessly in sam­sara. That is how beings without realization are deluded. The propensities fo r every phenomena of samsara and nirvana are present in the fo rm of seeds within the alaya. They are the cause of the appearance, through a process of dependent origination, of all internal substances (the evident material body and also its various channels, winds, and drops, and its purities and impurities) and all external substances (the worlds and beings of the three realms of samsara and nirvana). These do not truly exist but are rel­ative, illusory appearances, just like whatever appears in a dream. Extremely strong habituation to the belief that they are permanent, and to attachment to solidity and reality, causes the experience of the various states of happiness, suffering, and neutrality within the three realms and the six classes ofbeings. Thus, the causes and results of samsara cycle continuously and naturally, like a water wheel. That is the general characteristics of beings, bur even while they are deluded and wandering in samsara, all these obscurations cannot cause even an atom's worth of degeneration in the element of buddha nature, which is the essence of knowing. It is said in the Het'a)ra Ta ntra:"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"1he Bright To rch 293 All beings are indeed buddhas but are obscured by extrinsic impurities.570 [195] Ultimately, the primordial true nature is brilliant since it is the insepa­rability of the three kayas. Even during the intermediate period, when the extrinsic stains of illusory appearances obscure it, its own nature is as radiant as the three kayas. In the end, too, when the obscurations have been cleared away and the result of developing the two wisdoms has been made manifest, it shines as the three kayas. Therefore, the terms liberation and illusion signify only whether there is freedom fr om the stains of ignorance and illusory thought or not. It is said in the Sublime Co ntinuum: As it was before, so it is afterward. It has the quality of changelessness.571 Therefore, the mind naturally has a primordially pure essence. The extrinsic illusions or innate ignorance are like discolorations fo rming on gold, aris­ing fr om itself and obscuring itself [The Buddha] taught a variety of dis­tinct methods fo r its cleansing and purification, but [the mind's] essence is the aspect of wisdom itself, the self-arising wisdom that re mains unchanged throughout the three times and is fr ee fr om conceptual elaboration. Thus, the ultimate viewpoint of the Conqueror is that method and wisdom includes all paths. You might ask, \"But how can samsara and nirvana possibly be divisions of this single alaya?\" The answer is that camphor as a medicine can be either beneficial or harmful according to whether the illness is a hot or a cold illness. A poisonous substance can be transformed into medicine by certain meth­ods, such as mantras, but it will kill you if you take it without those meth­ods. In the same way, you will be liberated if you know and recognize the two essences of the alaya, but you will be deluded if you do not and, instead, conceive of a self. This difference is simply the result of having or not having realization. Arya Nagarjuna has said: Those who arc caught in the net of afflictions, arc those who arc called beings .

[A. Samatha} Generally, the word meditation can refer to many things. There are countless methods of meditation in the different traditions, but here the word or term meditation refers solely to internal familiarization with the natural state, that is, to the view that has just been explained. [198] It does not signify a men­tally contrived meditation on things with color and shape, or meditation on an artificial emptiness where all the mind's movements, thoughts, appear­ances, and perceptions have ceased. Here, meditation is solely maintaining your mind just as it is, without creating anything. Specifically, there are varying capacities or minds. There are \"immediate\" individuals who have sharp faculties and evidently have trained in their past lives. They don't need to be guided through sequential stages of samatha and vipa5yana because they become liberated immediately on their direct intro­duction [to the nature of the mind]. However, ordinary people need to be guided in stages. They begin with training in samatha on an object such as a twig, a pebble, a deity's image, a syllable, a round spot (hindu), or the breath. When they have gained stabil­ity in those practices, they practice supreme, objectless samatha. This is true samatha, and it is taught through three methods: 1. The mind rests in a fr esh and undistracted state, in which it is not dis­tracted by any internal or external object. 2. The three doors rest effortlessly, naturally, and loosely, without being very tightly controlled. 3. There is no separation or division, as when applying a remedy, between cognizance and the essence of thoughts. Instead there is just resting in the mind's self-knowing, self-clarity, and self-purity. These three [methods] are also known as nondistraction, nonmeditation, and nonfobrication."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"The Bright Torch 197 These also include the three doors of liberation taught within the general vehicles: 1. The door of liberation called signlessness is when the mind is not con­cerned with past activities, with thoughts about what was done or what happened, and so on. 2.. The door of liberation called emptiness is when the present mind per­fo rms no mental modifications, neither creating nor stopping any­thing because of thinking that something has appeared or something needs to be done. 3· The door of liberation named no aspiration is [the mind] not think­ing fo rward to what may happen in the fu ture and having no expec­tations, such as hoping to be able to meditate or worrying about not being able to meditate. These can be briefly summarized into just resting the mind naturally, as it is, unpolluted by alteration. When a thought suddenly appears within that state, (199] it is enough to simply be clearly aware of it, without becoming involved with it. Don't try to stop the thought in any way. Don't try to bring back meditation or apply some other remedy. Anything like that isn't the key point fo r maintaining an unaltered, unfabricated mind. There are various [teachings] in other different paths, but this is the path of simply recognizing whatever arises. Any other method you use will not be mahamudra meditation. The Great Brahman has said: Beings are polluted by seeking meditation. There is nothing at all on which to meditate. A single instant of being without any yearning. That is the meditation of mahamudra.s76 When directly resting in the nature of mind as it is, the experiences of the three states of samatha will sequentially arise. What are they?

When you become aware of the"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"298 Afahdmud1·d and Related lnstmctions difference between the mind at rest and the mind producing thoughts, [you will have reached] the first samatha, which is like a waterfall. [THE SECOND SAMATHA) As a result of maintaining that [first samath a] , most of your thoughts will be subdued and move gently. Your body and mind will fe el comfortable. You will be attracted to meditation and have no longing to engage in other activ­ities. Most of the time, you will have a powerful stability without any move­ment or production of thoughts. This is the intermediate samatha, which is said to be like the slow flow of a great river. [THE THIRD SAMATHA] If you continue to practice diligently, without distraction, you will reach a state where your body will have intense bliss with no sensation of pain. Your mind will have an unblemished purity and clarity that transcends the afflic­tions, which are no longer experienced. For as long as you meditate, you will be unwavering, with nothing being able to disturb you. Obvious affiictions will cease. You will have little attachment to fo od, clothes, and so on. You will have various experiences of the sights and limited clairvoyance. You will gain many such general \"qualities.\" That is the ultimate samatha, which is like an unmovmg ocean. There have been many meditators with strong dedication but little learn­ing, and without an experienced teacher, who during this stage became proud of these outward qualities. Then people believed them to be siddhas, [ 200) which proved disastrous fo r others as well as themselves. So be careful this doesn't happen to you. It's been taught that the practice of samatha alone cannot be the true prac­tice of mahamudra, but as it is its fo undation, it is truly of great importance. Gyalwa Lorepa has said: Even if you meditate fo r a long time in a relaxed samatha that is devoid of clarity, you will not realize the meaning. Meditate, with the sharpness of knowing's gaze, in a continuity of successive short sessions.\\--B. 'OJ e main practice: vip,ziyand You need to investigate, until doubts are eradicated, whether the nature of the mind has truly existing characteristics, such as shape and color, and"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"The Brigh t To rch 299 whether it has arising, abiding, and going; birth and cessation; or existence or nonexistence; whether it is eternal or nothing; has edges or a center; and so on. If you do not do that, you will not gain the actual view, and therefore you will not know how to maintain natural resting, natural med· itation. Then, however dedicated you are to controlling your mind, your samatha will be stupid and fo rced, and you will never transcend the karma of samsara's three realms. Therefore, with a genuine teacher, you must erad· icate your misconceptions. In particular, as you are a practitioner of the Mantrayana, the path of blessing, devote yourself to devotional prayers, dedicating yourself to the method fo r receiving the lineage's blessing fo r realization. When you do that, your own knowing will be the natural presence of the primordial dharmakaya, as previously described in the description of the view. It is a nonconceptual, directly experienced wisdom that does not fa ll into any extreme, such as existence or nonexistence, being or not being, eter· nalism or nihilism. Although you will know and experience the inseparabil· ity of clarity, knowing, and emptiness, you will have no example to give fo r it and no way to express it in words. This clear, self-arising self·illumination is called vipasyand. At first, while you're still an ordinary being, although it's never apart fr om you fo r even an instant, you fa il to recognize it because you haven't received the instructions and the blessing. In the intermediate period, it is what rests in samatha, what sees and knows whether you are at rest or not, and so on, but though it is all this, it does not see itself The continuous production of thoughts in the ordinary state is nothing other than this vipasyana itself appearing as thoughts. The experience of samatha and of bliss, clarity, and nonthought are nothing but the arising of this vipasyana's knowing. [ 201] If you do not know your own naked nature, fr ee from thought, you wiil have mental stability only, which cannot be a cause of enlightenment. Once you have seen your own nature, all mental stillness or production will be nothing other than vipasyana or mahamudra.

Samatha is when there is no attachment to solidity in relation to any external appearance to the six consciousnesses. Vipasyana is the unimpeded appearance of whatever arises in the mind. Therefore, appearances possess the complete union of vipasyana and samatha. Samatha is the clear awareness of a thought as it vividly arises. Vipasyana is when that thought is liberated within the naked, intellect-free mind. There­fo re thoughts, too, contain the union of vipasyana and samatha. Samatha is when you do not perceive the arising of intense affiictions as solid but see instead their very nature. Vipasyana is naked clarity and emp­tiness in which there is no separation between the seer's knowing and the seen afflictions.

Samatha and vipasyana, too, are simply that kind of inseparable union. Nevertheless, to make it easier fo r people to engage in their different aspects, there is the teaching of their having separate names and categories. The reason why it's said that samatha alone is not true mahamudra med­itation is that mental stability alone is only a mundane teaching.

Rather, practice where everything that appears, without any alteration, is the mahamudra. Having briefly described what samatha and vipasyana means, I now give a brief description of fa ults, qualities, and possible errors. This has two parts: 1. The general errors of not knowing how to maintain meditation 2. Various specific errors and blunders, and how to eliminate them 1. The general errors of not knowing how to maintain meditation Resting in the unaltered mind is the essential meaning of all the countless, profound, and vast meditation instructions, such as mahamudra, dzokchen, result as the path (lamdre), severance (cho), and pacification (shiche). Never­theless, these different kinds of instructions exist because individuals differ in their understanding. Some meditators say that meditation is simply the nonconceptual knowl­edge that all the obvious and subtle perceptions of the six consciousnesses have ceased, but this is just relaxed samatha. Some arrogantly assume that their meditation is stable when there is a neutral state of dullness devoid of aware mindfulness. Some state that meditation is a state of mind that has perfect clarity, vivid bliss, and utter emptiness, but this is merely being fix­ated on meditation experiences. Some say that all meditation is simply the blank consciousness that comes between the cessation of one thought and the arising of the next, but that is fr agmentary meditation. Some say that meditation is maintaining such thoughts as \"The mind is the dharmakaya. It is empty. It is ungraspable,\" or \"Nothing has any reality. Everything is like an illusion, like space,\" and so on, but this is fa lling into the extreme of mental fabrication and mental analysis. Some say that meditation is just whatever you th ink of, whatever comes up in the mind. but this is to fa ll under the power of ordinary th oughts, which brings the danger of insanity. Most oth­ers say that the mind\\ movements are fa ults that must be stopped. that you rest in meditation by restraining the mind's rnovemerH, hue this is having a"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"302 Jt.fahdmudrd and Related Instructions mindfulness that is too strict and too tight, [2.03] which results in an uncom­fo rtable mental bondage. In brief, whether your mind is still or in movement, whether you have intense thoughts and afflictions or are in a vivid state of bliss, clarity, or non­thought, whatever is happening, there is no need fo r fabrication, alteration, elimination, or transformation. You only need to maintain a natural, innate process. In these times, when there are very fe w who know this, we need a faultless practice that accords with the actual view taught in the collected works, practice instructions, and manuals of the siddha lineages and in the sutras and tantras that teach the definitive meaning. 2. Various sp ecific errors and blunders The past masters in the practice lineage taught extensively and in detail about these errors and mistakes, whereas I will describe them here in just a fe w token sentences. Attachment to experiences of clarity, bliss, or nonthought in your medita­tion will cause rebirth in the desire, fo rm, or fo rmless realms. When that life ends, you will fa ll into the lower existences, where you will no longer be on the path to buddhahood. We can examine this process in detail through the specifics of the nine dhyanas of concentration: 1. When you can rest in samatha without any obvious thoughts of sub­ject and object, but are still constrained by belief in there being a meditator and meditation, this is called the first dhyana's samadhi, because this is how the devas in the first dhyana realms meditate. Therefore, meditating in this way will cause you to be reborn as a first-dhyana deva. 2.. In the second dhyana you do not analyze or examine with your thoughts, but you nevertheless are experiencing the flavor of blissful samadhi. 3. In the third dhyana, your mind is unwavering, dependent solely upon the inhalation and exhalation of the breath. 4· The fo urth dhyana is a samadhi that is devoid of all thought and has a space-like unobstructed clarity. Although those [four dhyanas] are renowned to be the highest among all mundane samadhis and are a basis fo r vipasyana, to meditate on them with attachment will be an error in mahamudra that causes rebirth as a dhyana deva. There are also:"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"The Brigh t Torch 303 S· [The meditation of] thinking \"All phenomena are infinite like space.\" 6. [The meditation of] thinking \"This consciousness is not limited. It is infinite.\" [ 204] 7· [The meditation of] thinking \"There is neither identification nor the absence of identification, so that the mind has no activity.\" 8. [The meditation of] thinking \"This mind is empty. It is nothing h , w atsoever. Resting in those fo ur levels [of dhyana] has the defect of straying into the fo ur dy ata na permutations of the fo rmless [realms] : infinite sp ace, infinite consciousness, neither existence nor nonexistence, and nothingness. 9· The sravaka's samadhi of peace: This is the state of mind in which all those thoughts are eliminated, all engagement with objects has ceased, and there is a stability in which both mind and breath's move­ments have ceased. That is taught to be the ultimate samatha, but if it's devoid of vipasyana, it's not what is meant here by fa ultless meditation. Each of those nine concentration dhyanas have only the qualities of accomplishing such things as the clairvoyance or miraculous powers of their level, but you must also know that according to this teaching, let alone the ultimate goal of complete buddhahood, they don't even accomplish the rela­tive, ostensible qualities. Even if they do incidentally accomplish them, if that causes attachment and pride, they will truly be obstacles to enlightenment. Having explained those errors and wrong paths, I will now teach \"the eight fa ilings.\" 1. The primordial foiling in relation to the nature of emptiness: This is not realizing the mind to \"have the supreme of all aspects,'' 5H1 a term that means the unity of appearance and emptiness as an unimpeded inter­dependence of causes and results. Instead, your fo cus is on emptiness alone. You must know this to be a defect. 2. The circumstantial foiling in relation to the nature [of emptiness] : This is meditating with a comprehension of the meaning but without the experience of it having arisen within you-or you fo rget whatever experience you've had-so that though you can explain the meaning to others, you don't have it within yoursel£ 3. The primordial failing in relation to the path: This is thinking that what you need now is the path while the result is something else that will be obtained later."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"304 Mahamudra and Related lnstmctiom 4· The circumstantial failing in relation the path: This is th inking that simply maintaining the \"ordinary mind\"-your own mind-is not enough. Instead, you seek elsewhere for some longed fo r, imagined, marvelous meditation. s. The primordial fai ling in relation to remedies: This is not realizing that when something like an affliction arises, that itself should be brought onto the path. Instead, you meditate by using other methods fr om the lower vehicles. 6. The circumstantial failing concerning remedies: This is not knowing that when something like a thought arises, it should be used as the path. Instead, you think that you must stop or destroy these fa ctors in order to be in meditation. 7. The primordial failing concerning the seal of emptiness: This is not understanding that the mind is primordially empty, without any root. [205] Instead, you apply a seal of emptiness, such as a mentally fa bricated emptiness or a transitory emptiness, by such thoughts as \"This has no existing nature;' or \"This becomes empty.\" 8. Thecircumstantialfailingconcerningthe seal [ofemptiness ]: This is con­tinually thinking such thoughts as, \"I used to be involved in thoughts, but now I meditate well.\" Or it's having no aware mindfulnessm but thinking that you do have it, and so on. To sum up, cutting through conceptual embellishment about the nature of things and knowing the flaws concerning the true nature are the key fac­tors without which you will be in danger of fa lling into these similitudes of meditation; and all kinds of other things can happen too. However much effort you put into these similitudes of meditation, you will just tire your­self out to no purpose. Some even create the cause and conditions fo r a bad rebirth (such as meditation on a samatha of \"cessation\" causing rebirth as a naga). Therefore, it's very important that your meditation be without error. Also, there are those who are attached to a dull, dim state of mind without thought, believing it to be samatha. There are those who are proud of their conceptual examination and analysis, believing it to be vipasyana. There are th?se whose goal is a mindfulness that clings tightly to the solidity of exis­tence. There are those who mistake a neutral equanimity fo r the unaltered state. There are those who mistake the common ordinary mind, which does"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Thr Bn�cr.ht Torch �os not see the actual fa ce of the true nature, fo r the unaltered. unfabricated. intrinsic \"ordinary\" mind. There are those who become attached to a good samadhi. There are those who believe that mere stained bliss. which is fr ee of pain, is the natural supreme bliss. There are those who have not reached cer­tainty in the recognition of obje ctless true nature and instead mistake fixa­tion on a perceived object fo r the fixation-free. objectless, unceasing, natural clarity. And there are those who mistake mental dullness that is due to the cessation of clarity fo r nonconceptual wisdom. C. A summary of the cause of every kind of error, similitude, mistake, and failing In the beginning, there is the error of not purifying the stains of bad karma because of not properly engaging in the preliminaries. such as gathering the accumulations and purifying the obscurations. In the intermediate period, there is the fa ult of having a mind that is coarse and stiff because it has not been moistened by blessing. There is also the error of becoming intractably fo cused on words and verbal Dharma because the main practice hasn't cut through conceptual embellishments in your mind. In the end, you become unable to assimilate practice and are just a yellow­clad person belonging to neither this world nor the Dharma, or you will be just a merchant in the teachings of the practice lineage. There are plenty of people like that in this final stage of the era of degeneration. It is said in the Ten Wheels of K�itiga rbha Sutra : [2o6] Those who are Carvaka tirthikas do not believe in the ripening of karma. As soon as they die, they are reborn in Avici hell. They cause the ruin of others and also destroy themselves. stu It's important to make an effort to be in control of yourself so that you don't end up like that. Apply yourself single-mindedly to meditation without fa ll­ing under the power of the errors and fa ilings in view and meditation. The \"subsequent knowledge\" [of post-meditation] should also be in the grip of mindfu lness and awareness, so that you don't inattentively remain in ordi­nary illusions. If you can do this, you will have experiences and realization according to your individual mentality and capability."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"306 lvf ahdmudrd and Related Instructions [D. Meditation and post-meditation] Generally, scholars and siddhas have given numerous distinct teachings on meditation and post-meditation at this level, so that there are many different ways of identifying them. Some teach that in the fo ur yo gas there is no actual teaching on meditation and post-meditation below the level of nonelabora­tion. Some make a distinction between \"realization's meditation and post­meditation\" and \"experience's meditation and post-meditation.\" Some teach easily perceived fo rms of meditation and post-meditation as distinct in each of the fo ur yogas. There are innumerable teachings like this and, similarly, a variety of explanations on the difference between experience and realization. Some teach that all three [levels] of one-pointedness have only experience and no true realization. Some teach that when you have the true medita­tion [of one-pointedness ] you see the essence of the mind. There seem to be innumerable subtle classificatory teachings like this. They manifest fr om the compassionate wish fo r methods that will train the countless different dis­positions and natures that individuals have. Therefore, I have no doubt that they are all are true, and I take refuge in them all. I don't have the training, insight, and knowledge of that level, so if I were to give reasons why some are right and some are wrong, I'd be no different than a blind person trying to distinguish between good and bad colors. Nevertheless, to briefly describe what I have been able to understand, meditation and post-meditation are terms or signifiers used in the practice of both [the generation and completion] stages. Meditation is concentration on the actual practice without being mixed with any other kind of activ­ity. The term post-meditation is used fo r when [the practice] is mixed with other [activities] during the period in between sessions and so on. [207] Its knowledge is called subsequent knowledge and its \"appearances\" are called subsequent appearances. This use of these terms is agreed upon by all. In this teaching, meditation is used fo r when beginners are engaged in actual medi­tation, and post-meditation is used fo r when they are doing things, moving around, walking, eating, sleeping, and so on. However, when higher prac­titioners are completely fr ee of delusion, they are said to have \"inseparable meditation and post-meditation\" or \"ceaseless medication.\" Similarly, to make a distinction between experience and realization, they are, respectively, like a fa ult and a remedy in a practice that is not blended with the nature of the mind, at whatever level it may be. Experience is when"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Thr Bright Torch 307 the meditator and the meditation appear to be separate. Realization is gain­ing complete certainty that they are not separate fr om the mind but that it is the mind itself that arises as their natures. In brief. these two occur not only in meditation but in most practices of the path, such as guru yoga, compas­sion, bodhicitta, and the generation stage. For example, comprehension is like hearing from others a description of the shape and layout of Bodhgaya�\"� so that you get a general impression of it in your mind that you can also relate to others. Experience is like seeing Bodhgaya from a distance or looking at a painting of its layout, so that you comprehend most of what there is to be known about it. Realization is like arriving at Bodhgaya and having the cer­tainty of seeing it in all its details. [E. Ho w the practitioner should follow the path} The way in which meditation and post-meditation are introduced into the mind depends on which of three levels of capability an individual is on. The immediate individuals are great beings who make their previous training evi­dent; they have immediate comprehension, experience, and realization the moment they are shown a symbol, and without difficulty or effort they per­fe ct these qualities. Medium individuals are of the \"nonsequential\" type. They are those fo r whom qualities of realization don't arise in a fixed order but are unpredictably high or low and may increase or decrease. Gradualist individuals are ordinary beings who progress, depending on their diligence, through a definite sequence of common, general practices. [2o8] The graduated path fo r gradualist individuals includes the other two [paths], so I will explain that. The common vehicles teach that you reach buddhahood by traversing the general ten levels and the five paths, but the unequaled Dakpo Kagyii suc­cession of gurus and pupils teaches the particular fo ur stages of yoga, each one divided into greater, lesser, and medium levels, making twelve. Lord Dao Shonu explained this to be the view of the [ Ca krasa1?'Jvara] Tantra of the In conceivable Secret. That tantra says : The samadhi of the awesome lion awakens pure, unwavering, one-pointed knowledge fr om within self-knowing wisdom. The stable patience eradicates the suffering of the lower existences."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"308 Ma hdmudrd and Rela ted Instructions Second, through the samadhi that is like an illusion, inconceivable samadhi arises as power fr om the great meditation of nonelaboration. Heat is attained and there is control over birth. Third, the samadhi that is heroic causes the realization of the one taste of multiplicity to arise. You are a child of the buddhas of the three times and benefit others. The summit is attained and there is continuous development. Fourth, through application to the practice of nonmeditation, which is the samadhi that is like a vajra, there is the knowledge of wisdom and the Buddha realms are seen. There is the unsought, naturally present state of the great supreme quality.585 This viewpoint is taught extensively in the Lankdvatdra Sutra, and it has also been clearly explained by Acarya Santipa, who made classifications such as the five sights and omniscience. Guru Rinpoche also taught this in brief in the Nyingma tradition's mahamudra teachings, in the Record of Key Po ints, which combines the fo ur yogas with the fo ur eliminations. One-pointed [yoga is explained by the lines]: Good and bad actions are purified in the mind so that bad actions are naturally eliminated. Nonelaboration: The elaboration-free nature of the mind eliminates all subjects and objects. One taste: Appearances arise as the dharmakaya so that thoughts are spontaneously eliminated. Nonmeditation:"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Thr Bright Torch �09 Samsara and nirvana are known to have no real nature, so that all dualism is eliminated.

Summit is realizing the birthless dharmakaya. Pa tience is having neither samsara nor nirvana, neither adoption nor rejection. The supreme quality is samsara and nirvana dissolving into the mind.�86 [209] I will now give a seed-like description of: 1. The meaning of the fo ur yo gas 2. The way in which the fo ur yogas arise in sequence 3. A supplement that explains how the sutra tradition's paths and stages are completely included within the fo ur yogas 1. The meaning of the four yo gas This has fo ur parts: a. One-pointed yoga b. Nonelaboration c. One taste d. Nonmeditation a. One-pointed yoga LESSER ONE-POINTED YOGA Capable individuals who can cut through attachment to this life, see the guru as truly being a buddha, and truly receive blessing will, when resting in medi­tation, abide in states of clarity, bliss, and nonthought. They will attain sta­bility and certainty. Their thoughts will be spontaneously liberated as they recognize them. This will be accompanied by the fixation of thinking \"This is meditation.\" Past practice-lineage masters taught that all three levels of one-pointed yoga were solely samatha. However, in my understanding, there are some"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"310 Mahamudrd and Related Instructions definite differences between individuals on these different levels. There are others who view these levels as being within the province of vipasyana because the single knowledge of the true nature always has the inherent qual­ity ofbeing a union of samatha and vipasyana. At this level, the \"subsequent knowledge\" predominantly perceives things as real, and the practitioner's sleep is no different fr om that of an ordinary person. In brief. as this is the initial stage, there will be various degrees of ease and difficulty to maintaining the practice. MEDIUM ONE-POINTED YOGA During this stage, you are able to remain in meditation fo r as long as you wish. Samadhi will even arise sometimes when you're not meditating. Your \"sub­sequent knowledge\" will have a diminution of belief in reality, and appear­ances become spacious and clear. You can even at times practice while asleep. In brief, during th is stage, whenever you meditate, you will be meditating. GREATER ONE-POINTED (YOGA] It's taught that there will be a constant experience, day and night, of bliss, clarity, and nonthought. There will be no distinct \"subsequent appearances,\" \"s ubsequent knowledge:' and so on, as th ey will always be within samadhi. You will have no external or internal parasites. You will have no attachment to sensory pleasures. You will attain clairvoyance, miraculous powers, and so on. However, you will still not be fr ee yet fr om attachment to good expe­riences and you will not yet be liberated from the bondage of your mind's fixation on meditation. Therefore, there can be many individual variations because of such fa ctors as someone's diligence or level of capability fo r engag­ing in these three stages of one-pointed [yoga]. [210] Seeing the essence of one-pointed [yoga] is dependent on attaining the confidence that comes fr om the certainty of self-knowing in the very essence ofbliss, clarity, and non thought. Similarly, attaining mastery depends on your experiences being continuous. \"Thoughts arising as meditation\" depends on simply training in mindfulness of every thought that arises. The \"arising of qualities'' depends on your mind becoming tractable. Planting the seed of the fo rm kayas depends on uncontrived compassion arising during \"subsequent knowledge.\" Fully understanding relative [truth] depends on certainty in the interdependence of causes and results. Past Kagyii masters have taught that we must know these categories."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"lhe Bright Tm·ch 311 b. No nela boration yoga Whatever experiences you have in one-pointed [yoga], if you can apply your­self to practice and prayer without fa lling under the power of the arrogant belief in a self and attachment to good [experiences], then you will progress to [the yoga of] nonelaboration. LESSER NONELABORATION You truly realize that the mind has no extremes of arising, remaining, and ceasing. When you have mindfulness, your \"subsequent knowledge\" is liber­ated as meditation, but when there is no mindfulness it still has the percep­tion of solidity. In your dreams, you are sometimes deluded and sometimes not. At this level, there is fixation on emptiness, with such thoughts as, \"All the phenomena of appearance and existence are nothing but emptiness:' and soon. MEDIUM NONELABORATION You are purified of fixation on emptiness, on the reality of thoughts, and so on, though there remains the impurity of a subtle fixation on the reality of external appearances. During subsequent [attainment] and sleep, there may or may not be delusion and perception of solidity. In your practice, too, there can be many different levels and both progress and regress. GREAT NONELABORATION You completely cut through all conceptual embellishments concerning sam­sara and nirvana, outer appearances and the mind. You become liberated fr om attachment to whether there are appearances or no appearances, emp ­tiness or no emptiness, and so on. During most of your waking hours you have continuous meditation, while in your dreams you are occasionally fix­ated on delusions. However, at this level there still isn't an uninterrupted, unchanging continuity of mindfulness. Therefore, you still need some con­trol of mindfulness. In brief, the key point of the stage of nonelaboration is that it is princi­pally the experience of emptiness [ 2.11] and the experience of the unreality of everything. 1herefore, there is the possibility of a decline in devotion, pure perception, compassion, and so on. So it's important not to become over­powered by the obstacle of emptiness becoming your enemy."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"31l Ma hdmudrd and Rela ted Instructions At this level, seeing the essence of nonelaboration depends on becoming purified of the stain of certainty that is fixation on emptiness. Attaining mas­tery of it depends on becoming free from hope and fe ar concerning appear­ances and emptiness, and on cutting through conceptual embellishment of the path. Thoughts arising as meditation depend on training, during both subsequent appearances and sleep, in the realization of meditation that rec­ognizes all movement of thought to be nothing other than emptiness. The arising of qualities depends on being connected with such apparent signs of accomplishment as the twelve hundred qualities fr om seeing the truth of the realized meaning. The fu ll understanding of relative [truth] and planting the seed of the fo rm kayas depends on gaining certainty in the radiant power of emptiness manifesting as causes and results, and on then establish ing the fac­tors of dependent origination through bodhicitta and prayer. It's been taught that we must know these and other categories. c. One-taste yoga When you have fu lly realized the level of non elaboration, you realize that all dualistic names and categories, such as samsara and nirvana, appearance and emptiness, generation and completion, relative and ultimate, and so on, are of one taste in the mahamudra. You are able to absorb all the path's Dharma teachings into self-knowing. THE LESSER LEVEL OF ONE TASTE This is while there is still some bondage to certainty or to fixation on experience. MEDIUM ONE TASTE This is when you are purified of fixation on experience and realize the insep­arability of appearances and mind. The realizer's knowing and that which is realized are not fixated upon as having either a separate reality or a single one. Therefore, there is liberation from subject and object. GREATER ONE TASTE This is when all phenomena appear as the \"one taste of multiplicity\" so that there is the increasing power of wisdom, which is the realization of one taste itself arising as multiplicity. The great holders of the practice lineage have taught that at this time meditation and post-meditation become blended. All appearances and thoughts have the primordial nature of the dharma-"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"The Bright To rch 313 kaya, or the mahamudra, but there is a perception of solidity, a duality of sub­ject and object, and so on, in relation to appearances, to illusion. If you train in self-knowing mindfulness of these things, they will be spontaneously lib­erated. [212] This occurs in the loweryogas, too, but the training on this stage doesn't require a separate mindfulness or recognition, as any appearance or arising is itself enough. Seei ng the essence of on,e taste depends on that. The mastery of it depends on the one taste arising as multiplicity and there not being any residue of subtle attachment to remedy. Thoughts arising as medi­tation depend on there being neither bondage nor liberation in the unre­stricted appearance of all perceptions to the six consciousnesses. The arising of qualities depends on wisdom controlling all inner and outer phenomena and having the autonomy of performing miraculous emanations and trans­fo rmations. Understanding the relative depends on the cause and result of power over appearances and existences being adopted as the path, which occurs through blending mind and appearances so that there is realization of the one taste as multiplicity. Planting the seed of the fo rm kayas depends on the treasury of benefiting others being opened by the power of effortless, all-pervading com passion. d. No nmeditation yoga When you have completed [the yoga] of one taste, you will be purified of all dualistic appearances, such as meditation or no meditation, distraction or no distraction. All appearances will be liberated as the great primordial meditation. LESSER NONMEDITATION This is when, at night or at other times, there is a subtle fixation on the illusion-like nature of the propensities fo r subsequent appearances. MEDIUM NONMEDITATION This is when you are completely purified affixation on illusion. Day and night, everything is one great meditation, and the true nature is manifest.

The mother and child luminosity blend together, so that everything ripens as the single quintessence of the dharmakaya, the total expanse of wisdom. This is also called true, complete buddhahood. It is the final result. It's taught that seeing the essence of nonmeditation depends on being purified of the \"knowledge of experience;' such as habituation to repeated meditation on the full realization of one taste. [2.13] The mastery of non­meditation depends on the wisdom of realization being fr ee of all the subtlest stains of ignorance and all the propensities fo r objects of knowledge. Thoughts arise as meditation through the dlaya's propensities dissolv­ing into dharmadhatu wisdom. Qualities appear through the material body becoming a rainbow body, through the mind becoming the dharmakaya, through infinite pure realms appearing, or through liberation. The seeds of the fo rm kayas manifest through the body as a \"wheel of inexhaustible adornments;' effortlessly benefiting beings throughout space. All relative aspects are purified into the essential nature through all the great qualities ofbuddhahood being complete. Past Kagyiipas have explained these and all other very subtle categories. 2. A brief summary of the Jour yogas: [the way in which the Jour yo gas arise in sequence} One-pointedness is being able to remain in meditation fo r as long as you wish. Nonelaboration is the ordinary mind recognizing itself and the realization of baselessness and sourcelessness. One taste is when attach­ment to the dualism of samsara and nirvana is liberated with in knowing. Nonmeditation is the purification of all stains, which are certainties and propensities. In particular, during one-pointed [yoga] the difference between medita­tion and post-meditation is whether you are in stillness or not. During non­elaboration, the [difference between] meditation and post-meditation is whether you have mindfulness or not. In the one-taste yoga and above, med­itation and post-meditation are inseparably blended. Also, one-pointed yoga is when the nature of thoughts arises as non­thought. Nonelaboration is when they arise as emptiness. One taste is when they arise as equality. Nonmeditation is when they arise transcending the intellect. Also, during one-pointedness, delusion arises just as it is. Within non-"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"'flJ e Bright Torch 3IS elaboration, it is real ized to be baseless and sourceless. During one taste, delusion arises as wisdom. In nonmeditation, there are no longer the terms delusion and no delusion. Also, each one has its own consummation: The supreme realization in one-pointedness is the inseparability of stillness and movement; in nonelab­oration, it is the inseparability of delusion and liberation ; in one taste, it is the inseparability of appearances and mind; in nonmeditation, it is the insep­arability of meditation and post-meditation. Also, in one-pointedness, the mind has the perception of solidity. In non­elaboration the mind has meditation and post-meditation. In one taste the mind has union. In nonmeditation the mind is manifest. [214] Also, during one-pointedness, thoughts are subjugated. During nonelab­oration, thoughts are cut through. During one taste, self-arising wisdom appears fr om within. During nonmeditation that wisdom becomes stable. To sum up, it seems the list of divisions and categories is endless and inde­scribable, but the most important thing we need to know and the only thing that matters is recognizing the true nature, the true meaning of the mind exactly as it is, and to know how to maintain the natural state of the ordinary mind, just as it happens to be, without polluting it with mental fabrication. According to Jnanagakini Niguma: If you do not know that whatever appears is meditation, how can you attain it through relying on remedies? You cannot eliminate objects and conditions by eliminating them, but if you know they are illusions, they are spontaneously liberated.587 Most Dharma practitioners in these times are proud and bound tightly by this world's bondage. They are interested only in accumulating fo od, clothes, happiness, desires, objects, and artifacts fo r this life. Some have no control over their own minds because they're intoxicated by the poison that is their pride and arrogance of knowing many terms and teachings. There are a fe w people interested in meditation on the definitive mean­ing, but lacking a genuine teacher and teachings, they are imprisoned in the discomfort of fo rced meditation. Not knowing how to practice open spa­ciousness, they practice a lot of stupid meditation, bought at the cost of their life fo rce. Most other meditators are bad; they're all talk, they're like an empty bel­lows or a stew made fr om lungs, and the mountains and valleys are filled with"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":":u6 Ma hamud,·a and Rela ted Instructions them. In such times as these, there's little point in teaching the qualities of the fo ur yogas. It's like describing water in a desert. Foremost worthy ones, who have unalloyed experience and realization, don't rely on external words and letters. Their wisdom is fr om meditation; it has come fr om within. So I'm well aware that there's no need fo r teachings such as mine that resemble someone describing some fa raway place they've never seen. Worthy individuals with diligence who rely on a pure teacher, receive bless­ing, and dedicate themselves to practice are genuine individuals who gain the realizations and experiences of the fo ur yogas as taught here and elsewhere. They also incidentally pass through the entire five paths [215] and ten levels of the common vehicles. It is said in the Ki ng of Meditations Sutra: Whatever man holds this supreme samadhi, wherever that Dharma holder goes, [he will completely illuminate all beings] and will have a perfectly peaceful conduct and mind. He will also attain the ten levels: Perfect Joy, Stainless, Shining, Blazing, Difficult to Master, Manifest, Gone Far, Undisturbed, Excellent Intelligence, and Dharma Clouds.5811 [3 . A supp lement that explains how the sutra traditions paths and levels are completely included within the four yogas} First, on the lesser, medium, and greater stages of the path of accumulation, there appear the fo ur mindfulnesses, the fo ur complete eliminations, and the fo ur bases of miraculous powers. However, the way in which these are completely included within the swift path of mahamudra instructions is as fo llows: ·First, there are the general preliminaries, in which there is the contempla­tion on the suffering of sam sara, the difficulty of attaining the fr eedoms and opportunities, the impermanence oflife, and so on. This naturally includes: a. The mindfulness of the impurity of the body b. The mindfulness of the sensation of suffering c. The mindfulness of the impermanence of the mind d. The mindfulness of the selflessness of phenomena"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"1he Bri .. �ht To rch 317 Therefore, when you have experienced, contemplated, and gained certainty in the key points of [the general prelim inaries] you will have traversed the lesser path of accumulation. In the same way, taking refuge. developing bodhicitta, reciting the hundred syllables, and offering the mandala include the fo ur complete eliminations: a. Not giving rise to bad actions b. Rejecting those that have arisen c. Developing good qualities d. Increasing those that have been developed Therefore, this is traversing the medium path of accumulation. Subsequently, the fo ur bases of miraculous powers are in the guru yoga: a. One-pointed devotion to the guru is aspiration as a basis fo r miracu­lous powers. b. Prayer [to the guru ] is diligence as a basis fo r miraculous powers. c. Receiving the fo ur empowerments is conduct as a basis fo r miracu­lous powers. d. The final blending of the guru with your own mind is the mind's samadhi as a basis fo r miraculous powers. This is traversing the greater path of accumulation. The Perfection Vehicle teaches that through completing the path of accu­mulation you develop such qualities as being able to go to pure realms and see the fa ces of nirma.Qakaya buddhas. The mahamudra corresponds with that view, because the supreme guru is the essence of the three kayas of buddha­hood and all his \"realms of pupils\" are nothing other than nirma.Qakaya realms. [216] The stages of lesser, medium, and greater one-pointedness correspond to the path of engagement: a. Seeing the essence of the mind is [the path of engagement's level of] heat. b. Developing certainty in that is [the path of engagement's level of] summit. c. Being unaffected by circumstances is [the path of engagement's level of] patience. d. The continuous experience of one-pointedness is the path of engage­ment's worldly supreme quality."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"318 Afahdmudrd and Related Instructions During this stage, the specific qualities of the five powers arise: a.

Not having laziness as an obstacle is the power of diligence. d. An unbroken continuity of meditation is the power of samadhi. e. The realization of the definitive meaning is the power of wisdom. Each of those five develop into consummations of their power, which are called strengths. Therefore, when the three levels of one-pointedness are real­ized, you have completed the path of engagement. At [the level of] non elaboration, you enter the path of seeing the realized truth that you have learned about but have never seen before. This level natu­rally includes the meditations on the aspects of enlightenment taught in the Perfection Vehicle: a. Remaining in the meaning of the true nature of phenomena, exactly as it is, is the enlightenment aspect of samadhi. b. Being untainted by afflictions is the enlightenment aspect of the per­fect differentiation of phenomena. c.

However, most others teach that you reach the first level [of enlightenment] on seeing the nature of nonelaboration and developing the path of seeing. Clearly there is no definitive conclusion concerning this because beings have different capabilities. There must certainly be varying natures and speeds of progressing through the paths.

That is why it's said that you have attained a level [of enlightenment] (bhumi). From the Avata,zsaka Sutra: As soon as you reach the levels, you will be fr ee from the five fe ars: You will not have the anxiety oflacking sustenance, of dying, of lacking praise, of the lower existences, or of (lacking] a retinue. 589 Thus the qualities become greater and greater within the ten levels. When you reach the levels, this is called the path of meditation, because you are fa miliarizing yourself with the meaning of the path of seeing. On this level you practice the eight aspects of the noble path. All meditation is nothing but immaculate samadhi, but during post-meditation you are polluted and fa m iliarizing yourself with the noble eightfold path. These eight are: correct view, correct realization, correct speech, correct action, correct livelihood, correct effort, correct mindfu lness, and correct samadhi. In brief, these accomplishments have the quality of being purely unmistaken. Therefore, they truly have the many distinguishing qualities of the superior actions in the lower vehicles. TH E FIRST LEVEL [OF ENLIGHTENMENT] The first level is called Perfect Joy because there is supreme joy at these special qualities. During this stage, \"meditation sessions\" are a birthless state wi.th­out thought and in \"subsequent [attainment],\" through [seeing phenomena] as being like illusions, you benefit beings primarily by accomplishing the perfection of generosity through giving away, without fe ar or sadness, your head, limbs, and so on. You continue traversing the path in this way, passing through the sequence of the ten perfections combined with the ten levels. This is what is taught in extensive detail within the general vehicles. In this teaching, however: a. The first level is called Perfect Joy, because the joy of samadhi greatly increases during the first [level] of nonelaboration. b. The second level is called Stainless, because of fr eedom fr om all the stains of meditation. c. The third level is called Shining, because ofbenefiting beings through the power of the realized meaning."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"320 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions d. The fo urth level is called Blazing, because of the increase in reveal­ing buddhahood's qualities of greatness during the medium [level of] nonelaboration. [ 2 1 8] e. The fifi:h level is called Difficult to Master, because of realizing the union of emptiness and compassion, which purifies all the stains of propensities, which are so difficult to purify. f. The sixth level is called Manifest, because it is reached through the great [level] of nonelaboration becoming manifest. This is the real­ization that samsara and nirvana are birrhless. The sravakas and pratyekabuddhas can reach those first six levels also. g. The seventh level is called Gone Far, because at the beginning [level) of one taste, such dualistic appearances as meditation and post­meditation, samsara and nirvana, and so on are liberated in union. h. The eighth level is called Undisturbed because at the medium [level of] one taste there is no deviation from the true mindfulness that is the quality of realization. i. The ninth level is called Excellent Intelligence because at the great [level of] one taste, all stains apart from subtle illusion-like dualistic appearances are purified. j. The tenth level is generally known as Dharma Clouds, which in this teaching is the lesser and medium [levels of] nonmeditation.

At this level, you will have the same qualities as bodhisattvas who are lords of the tenth level. The true state of buddhahood is when you reach the conclusion of the supreme, ultimate path of the common vehicles. This is when the stain of not recognizing nonthought, which is the subtle propensity of [the obscu­ration of] knowledge, dissolves into the nature of vajra-like wisdom, which is the great self-arising self-knowing.

Both these special, internal levels manifest in a single instant. The final level ofbuddhahood is called the thirteenth [level], or [the state] of the sixth [buddha], Vajradhara. This has benefit fo r oneself, which is the complete attainment of the dharmakaya, and benefit fo r others, which is its power of manifestation as form kayas that continuously bring great benefit to all beings throughout space until samsara is emptied.

For example, most beings, such as birds and wild beasts. are born fr om their mothers' wombs and don't become fu lly developed to r a while. The grad­ualists are like that. However, the garuda, who is the lord of birds, and the lion, who is the king of wild beasts, already have their complete powers inside the egg or mother's womb. At that time they can't be seen, but as soon as they're born, their three powers�Q! are fu lly developed so that they can accomplish all activities, such as flying in the sky with their mother. In the same way, some yogins do not have actually visible signs while they arc still confined within th eir material bodies, but on being fr eed fr om the traps that are their bodies, the result simultaneously ripens as the fu lly developed power of their quali­ties. There are also num erous individuals who, having accomplished the path that unites method and wisdom, visibly manifest the signs of that path, such as miraculous powers and clairvoyance, in that very life. Basically, you attain fr eedom in the wisdom that �nows the equality of space and wisdom, the intellect-transcending true nature, and the intrinsic nature of the mind itself. Otherwise, all you will get is just a fe w signs of heat through the practice of the generation and completion, the channels, winds, drops, and so on. In these times there are so many siddhas possessed by the go ngpo demons who rejoice in these [few signs], prize them, fixate on them as wonderful, become conceited, and herd themselves and others into the lower existences. Therefore, I beseech those with critical minds to realize this fo r themselves. That was a brief teaching on the view, meditation, and stages of the path. [ 221] I now give a short teaching on the ancillary subject of how to enhance results through performing the conduct of \"bringing into the path.\" In general, most Mantrayana paths have different kinds of conduct, such as the three categories of elaborate, simple, and very simple [conduct]. There are also many different categories such as secret conduct, public conduct, vidydvrata, and victorious conduct. Most of these are primarily fo r enhanc­ing the results of generation and completion stage practices. Here the only conduct that is highly valued is the \"completely excellent conduct:' which maintains an intrinsic, intellect-transcending approach. Even at the beginning, those who practice the preliminaries-gathering accumulations, purifying obscurations, and receiving blessings-should dedicate themselves to the completely excellent conduct: a behavior that is unpolluted by any stain fr om life's activities or fr om the eight worldly con­cerns, and gives no reason to fe el ashamed."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"3l+ Ma htimudrd and Related lmtmctiom In the middle stage, those engaged in the main practices-thoroughly examining view and meditation and gaining certainty in self-knowing­should dedicate themselves to the completely excellent conduct: beating out fr om within the nails of many thoughts; cutting through the mind's bond­age of arrogant conceptual embellishments; mastering everything through knowing one thing; and becoming liberated fr om all through knowing one thing.s93 In the end, there is the particular conduct to enhance the results of prac­tice, fo r which there are different texts and practice instructions, but the essential point is to develop: 1. The conduct of a wounded deer, which means completely cut­ting through bondage to this world and wandering in uninhabited mountains. 2. The conduct that is like a lion running alongside ravines, which is not fe aring negative circumstances. 3. The conduct that is like wind moving through the air, which is having no attachment to sensory pleasures. 4. The conduct like that of a lunatic, which means not involving your­self in either ending or engendering the eight [worldly] concerns. s. The conduct that is like a spear being whirled in the air, which is allow­ing the mind to move fr eely as it wishes, unrestricted by the bondage of dualism. 6. The supreme, completely excellent conduct, which is cutting through the bondage of delusion, distraction, hope, and fe ar, and fo cusing solely on maintaining an unfabricated state, because even a hair tip of hidden, internal desire fo r signs, omens, experiences, realizations, siddhis, and so on, will only obscure the fa ce of the ultimate nature, the dharmakaya. Even if there are thoughts, afflictions, suffering, fe ar, pain, death, or anything that seems to be a special circumstance, [ 222) don't hope fo r or depend on any remedial method other than knowing this main practice, the mahamudra, the ultimate nature. This is the king of all enhancement practices. Yo gins who can practice it in this way gain power over all appearances and existences in sam­sara and nirvana; they are fr ee fr om all obstacles; they accumulate an ocean of siddhis; the darkness of the two obscurations disappear; the sun of the signs of accomplishment rises; they find buddhahood in their own minds; and they open a treasury of benefit fo r beings. That is the nature (of this conduct]."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"The Bright To rch 3lS But it's sad to now see meditators doing nothing but spending their lives planning, like a child by a pond of lotuses, thinki ng, \"I'm going to choose this-no, that one would be better!\" while having thrown away this all­sufficing jewel they had in their hands. That concludes my brief teaching on the nature of the basis, the path, the view, and the meditation. Ill 1he result mahdmudrd I will conclude with a brief teaching on the result mahamudra, which is the inseparability of the three kayas, or the union of the two kayas. Yogins who see the fa ce of the true nature, the basis mahamudra, have truly ac complished through their practice the mahamudra of view, medita­tion, and path. This is the manifestation of mahamudra as the final result, the ultimate truth, and the dharmakaya. The essence of the dharmakaya is self-knowing. It is the original, unaltered wisdom, which is changeless, neither increases nor diminishes, primordially pervades all beings in the three realms, and manifests through the profound key methods of practice. There is no buddha or dharmakaya other than this. It is not something previously nonexistent that is newly created. CHARACTERISTICS [OF THE RESULT MAHAMUDRA] It is called possession of two wisdoms because it has the wisdom that knows ultimate nature and [the wisdom] that knows relative multiplicity. It is called possession of two purities, because its essence is primordially pure and it has also been purified of connate, nonintrinsic stains. Therefore, it is fr ee from every stain that prevents seeing or knowing all the phenomena that can be known, and it has completely perfected every positive quality. The dharmakaya's radiance, or wisdom's unimpeded display, is the mani­festation of the sarpbhogakaya and nirmaQakaya. These three kayas have the qualities of the seven aspects of union. What are these seven? The three par­ticular qualities of the sarpbhogakaya (enjoyment body) : 1. The aspect of enjoyment, which is the continuous, eternal enjoy­ment of the profound and vast Mantrayana Dharma wheel fo r the bodhisattvas in Akanigha. [ 2 2 3] 2. The aspect of sexual union, which is union with a consort fo rmed fr om light as a wisdom body with all the primary and secondary s1gns."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"p.6 Afahamudra and Related Instructions 3. The aspect of great bliss, which is an uninterrupted continuity of great, immaculate bliss. The three particular qualities of the nirmaQakaya: 4. The aspect of being completely filled with compassion that is object­less compassion, which, like space, pervades everywhere. S· The aspect of uninterrupted continuity, which is a vast, nonconcep­tual, naturally present activity that extends to the limits of samsara. 6. The aspect of noncessation, which is not to rest in the extreme of nir-, vanas peace. The particular quality of the dharmakaya: 7· The aspect of having no nature: this is the union of emptiness and compassion, transcending all conceptual elaboration. [The sa1pbhogakaya] also guides with eigh t qualities of lordship: 1. Lordship over body: having any fo rm of any body in order to train particular beings 1. Lordship over speech: the continuous turning of whatever Dharma wheel is necessary to train [particular beings] 3· Lordship over mind: having nonconceptual compassion 4. Lordship over miracles: having unimpeded, miraculous powers S· Lordship over omnipresence: having the true enlightenment of one taste, which is the equality of the three times, samsara and nirvana 6. Lordship over desire: being unstained by desire, even if as many god­desses as there are atoms in twelve Mount Merus made offerings of sensory pleasures 7· Lordship over the creation of whatever is desired: being able, like a wish-fulfilling jewel, to fulfill the hopes and desires of beings 8. Lordship over residence: eternally dwelling in Akanigha dharma­dhatu as the Dharma king of the three realms \"Guiding with the eight lordships\" is primarily a synonym fo r the quali­ties of the saq1bhogakaya. The dharmakaya and sarpbhogakaya manifest the nirmaQakaya as emanation-teachers who are like reflections of the moon in all the countless water bowls that are their pupils. The nirmiQakaya is the appearance of infinite emanations in whatever fo rm is necessary to teach beings, such as created, born, and great enlightenment [emanations].s94 They are called the \"s ecret body, speech, and mind of the buddhas as a wheel of unceasing adornments.\" [ 114]"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"1he Bright Torch '27 TH E CAUSE FOR THE KAYAS TO ARISE The dharmakaya is the result of truly accomplishing the ultimate -empti­ness and mahamudra-while upon the path . The nirmaQakaya is an aspect of it, or part of its method, because it arises through having developed pure bodhicitta, aspiration prayers, and so on. lhe saq1bhogakaya arises from the causes and results of meditation on the profound generation stage. The ever­lasting domain of the three kayas' inseparability is the result not of doing those practices separately or alternately but of engaging in the union of method and wisdom, in the great complete purity from the triple aspects of conceptualization.��� There are many more categories of these three kayas, and also of fo ur, five, or more kayas, which are essentially one but given different names in terms of aspects of qualities and activities. However, they are nothing other than the nature, radiance, and power of the present mind, which we call the three kayas at the time [of the result] . In the causal vehicles, the lower tantras, and so on, there are various tradi­tions of explanation based on certain scriptures that were intended fo r par­ticular circumstances, or in which the true meaning is only implied. There appears to be controversy over these grounds fo r debate involving a lot of proofs and refutations. The disagreement is over whether the dharmakaya has a fa ce and arms or not, whether it truly manifests a realm or not, whether buddhas have wisdom in their own individual beings or not, whether the two fo rm kayas have individual experiences of sensory perceptions or not, and so on. Each viewpoint may be valid in its own context, but in this quintessen­tial essence of the vehicles, we don't depend on finding proofs fo r views in the lower vehicles. We have the viewpoint described as \"in agreement with all and distinct fr om all.\" What is this viewpoint? It has no attachment to such things as reality or unreality, existence or nonexistence, identity or noniden ti ty, arising or ceasing, coming or going, eternality or nothingness, to any phenomena within appear­ance or existence, within samsara or nirvana. Therefore it neither proposes, refutes, nor proves. Why? Because if we say that th ere is nonexistence, we fall into the extreme of nihilism, but if we say there is existence, we fa ll into the extreme of eternalism, and if we hold the belief that there is neither existence nor nonexistence, we are failing to transcend a state of mental fa brication. As fo r others, if they say their perceptions exist, we can agree with that, because, [2.25] through the infallibility of dependent origination and causes and results, there is an unceasing, unstoppable manifestation of appearances."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"328 11-fahtimudrd and Related Instructions If they say they have no existence, we can agree with that, because having no existing nature of their own whatsoever, appearances are never apart fr om emptiness. If they say that appearances are neither existent nor nonexistent, we can agree with that, too, because this does not fall into an extreme and is without partiality or bias. In the deluded perceptions that arise from the propensities of impure beings, everything that appears as an external world and its inhabitants appears to be fo rmed from the solid, material five elements. In the percep­tion of yogins on the path, they are the unimpeded appearances of their own mind. For buddhas and bodhisattvas, it is the realm of self-illuminating wis­dom. Thus, ultimately, everything is simply the display of the mind itself Similarly, fo r impure, deluded beings, their minds, and the mental events that are their thoughts, have the nature of karma, affiictions, and propensi­ties. For yogins on the path, they are particular aspects of view, meditation, experience, and realization. For the buddhas, the three kayas of the suga­tas, they are the display of knowledge, compassion, and wisdom. Therefore, in the true nature of the basis, or cause, there isn't even an atom of differ­ence, the only difference being whether one is thickly obscured by \"imagi­nary\" extrinsic obscurations, only partially obscured, or entirely free fr om obscuration. s96 The single key point is to relax in your own unaltered mind, the mahamudra, which is the essential meaning of never having been apart fr om, not being apart fr om, and never going to be apart from the union of the two kayas, or the inseparability of the three kayas, which is the essence of the basis, path, and result. Those with composite intellects, who embellish or denigrate the non­composite Dharma and who are attached to the extreme of words and to disputes between different traditions, are like childish people arguing about how fa r space extends. If you rest in a state of great, all-pervasive equality within unfabricated relaxation, you will no doubt be liberated in a state that transcends concepts of traveler and destination: the expanse of the naturally present result of the fo ur yogas, the ten levels, the five paths, and the three kayas.

Because of my devotion to him, nectar descends, washes away my karmic body, and purifies me of bad karma and obscurations. Do that recitation and visualization and chant the hundred-syllable mantra many times. Imagine that Vajrasattva merges into you and end the session. (Practice 2) [230] Next is the meditation of guru yoga, in order to quickly receive bless­ing. From baseless space arises the sound of emptiness as aharp, causing the world and its beings to melt. They reappear as an inconceivable palace with no nature of its own. You are in its center as Bhagavan Heruka. You are blue in color, with one fa ce and two arms. Your two arms, holding a vajra and bell, embrace your consort, Vajrayogini. She is red and holds a flaying knife and kapdla skullcup. Her left leg is straight, and she bends her right leg around you. Jewels, a vajra cross, and a crescent moon adorn your top­knot. You wear a a long garland of fifty freshly severed heads and a crown of five skulls, topped by jewels. You stand on your unbent right leg. On the crown of your head is Guru Vaj radhara, who is blue and seated in vajra pos­ture and holds a vajra and bell. He is embraced by his consort, Vaj ravarahi, who is red, holds a flaying knife and kapdla, and is seated in the lotus pos­ture:. You are standing upon a lotus and moon, in the midst of an expanse of brilliant light rays. Imagine that light rays radiate fr om your body transforming all beings into offering goddesses that make offerings to you. For that visualization, recite : Aha1fl, the sound of emptiness, comes fr om empty space, causing me to appear as the heruka."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"The Quintessence ojNuta1· HS The guru and his consort are pleasurably seated on the crown of my head. All beings become offering goddesses and make offerings to us. Following that visualization, recite: In the presence of the guru, who is the union of all budd has, with devotion I offer to the sublime ones Mount Meru with the fo ur continents, a hundred million fo ur continents, a hundred billion and a hundred trillion, all gathered into a single mandala. I offer the three doors, the possessions, and the accumulation of good karma of all beings and pray that you accept it.

I pray that you give your blessing. The offering goddesses merge into the guru's consort. Because of the nondual union of the male and fe male consort, they are pleased by the secret offering of bliss and emptiness, and their beauty shines brilliantly. Following that meditation and recitation, in order to receive empowerment, recite: E ma ho! E ma ho! Dharma! E ma ho! The meaning of the Dharma appears.

They gather and reside in the guru's heart. They melt into bodhicitta, which flows through the pathway of the vajra and emanates into the lotus of the fe male consort. It makes an offering to the mandala deities in the fe male's body, and then the vajra \"bee\" completely drinks the \"honey:· which is all of the mandala dei­ties melted into nectar in the fe male's body. This flows from their point of union, enters through your fo ntanel, enters the interior of the central chan­nel, and emanates and pervades the seventy-two thousand channels. In this way you receive the vase empowerment, and the purified channels manifest the vajra body. The overflow of the liquid nectar reaches the guru and his consort's fe et so that they become even more brilliantly beautiful than before. Then the guru and consort kiss, embrace, squeeze together their hip channels, and fiercely grind together their vajra and lotus. As a result, white and red bodhicirra is produced as a flow of liquid. It reaches your tongue, which is in the fo rm of a three-pronged vajra. From there it passes through the ya, ra , Ia , and valet­ters that are in the throat and spreads and pervades the twenty-one thousand winds that make up the ten winds.

She merges into the consort that is united with you as the heruka. This union of the heruka and consort causes bodh icitta to descend from the crown of your head to the throat so that \"joy\" is experienced. The vajra completely enter­ing the lotus causes the bodh icirra to descend to the heart, so that supreme joy is experienced. Fastening the lower air and preventing emission causes the bodhicirra to reach the navel, and sp ecial joy is experienced. Then the vajra slowly sucks the lotus anthers so that it holds the melted vitality element. The bodhicirra spreads, pervading to the very tip of the secret organ, and innate jo_y is experienced. In this way you obtain the wisdom and knowledge empowerment, and the purified drop manifests the vajra of mind. After that, the experience of the nonconceptual. inexpressible true nature, the wisdom of great bliss, develops within your own being. It becomes blended with the nondual great bliss wisdom of the minds of Guru Vaj ra­dhara and his consort in an elaboration-free one taste.

Pray to the guru with devotion, reciting: Orrz ah hurrz kaya vak citta jfzana vajra svabhava atmako 'harrz. [ Orrz ah hurrz. I am the identity of the nature of the body, speech, mind, and wisdom vajras.] This causes all worlds and beings within the three realms to become the \"basis and based\" of the \"wheel of wisdom.\" In the center is yourself as Bhagavati Vajrayogini, red in color, young, and mature. All her physical prominences are dark red, as if highlighted by lac­quer. [233] Your single face bares its fangs slightly. Your right hand brandishes a flaying knife, while the left holds a blood-filled skull bowl. The crook of your arm supports a khatvanga staff. which is the heruka [consort]. A third of your hair is tied up in a knot while the rest hangs freely. You wear a long necklace of human heads. Your breasts and vagina are enlarged and promi­nent. You enjoy a dancing posture upon a lotus, sun, and yellow corpse. You are within an inferno of wisdom fire. The interior of your body is vivid and clear, free of any impurity, like an empty painting made on the surface of space. Visualizing this as without solidity, recite: My body is the body ofVajrayogini. Red, with a dark red luster, holding a flaying knife and kapala. Vagina and breasts completely enlarged, in a dancing posture. Vivid and clear, free of any affliction. Do that recitation and meditation. [Practice 4] In order to practice with a body that is an insubstantial image, meditate well on the \"empty body.\" Follow that with mastering the \"family-endowed basis:· which is the training of the channels. \"1� Next, imagine the navel cakra. It is red, has sixty-four channel petals, faces upward, and is triangular, in the shape of the letter e.\"'1\" The heart cakra is"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"7he Quintesunce �(Nectar 339 white, with eight channel petals.

The crown cakra, with thirty-two channel petals, faces downward, is white and round, in the shape of the letter va1?'J. Meditate that these [channel petals] have closed ends, are transparent, have the same thickness as the la f,lnti and rasand, but are not connected to the /a /and or the rasand. In order to visualize that, recite: Within the body is the straight, vivid central channel extending from the secret place to the fontanel. The !a/and and rasand are the satne length, red and white in color. [234] There are the four cakras, extremely clear. Perform that recitation and meditation. (Practice s) Next, in order to train the winds, draw in the breath through the nostrils, naturally and with slightly increased mindfulness and effort. At the moment when it has completely gathered within, expel completely all the residual breath, beginning slowly and eventually with intense force, so that the ocean is pressed against Mount Meru.621 All the bad karma and obscurations that you have accumulated throughout beginningless lifetimes exit through your nostrils and from all the pores of your body as if they are flowing freely through a sieve, and you become completely purified. Rest your mind upon this utterly purified body, which is like a stainless fire crystal.622 Then, inhale slowly and at length. Press down on the navel while simulta­neously swallowing saliva. Pull up the lower air by contracting the demon's mouth623 inward. Both the upper and lower winds fill the inflated lower part of the stomach. When pressing down becomes uncomfortable, concentrate it into the navel and by naturally and slightly relaxing the interior of the body, crush [the air] and imagine that it leaves through the body's pores, in little spurts. When you think that you can suppress it no longer, imagine that it exits through the crown of your head in great puffs. This \"firing like an arrow through the crown of the head\" should be done once at the beginning of each session. At all other times, imagine that [the air] is completely expelled through"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"340 Mahdmudrd and Rela ted lmtructiom the nostrils, like the smoke of an incense stick, disappearing in space about sixteen finger-widths away. When you are gathering air back in, imagine that it appears from space, sixteen finger-widths away, like a cord of light that dis­solves into the central channel at the region of your heart. This practice is called firing like an arrow. Alternatively, when crushing the breath as described above, practice the inner crushing of th e breath, in which the winds of the la land and ra sand are made to enter the central channel, like water directed through irrigation ditches. Imagine that they reach halfway between the navel and the heart and disappear. Then focus your mind on the perfect emptiness of the cen­tral channel's interior. That is the supreme method of \"crushing the breath.\" However, for a beginner, the previous approach is more beneficial for hold­ing the breath fo r a long time, while this latter method is beneficial for gain­ing the final qualities. The four practices of inhalation, filling, crushing, and firing like an arrow are called the four applications. Even though it's. not easy to practice the meditation and recitation together, you should definitely train in the meaning of the following recita­tion in order to make the mental image clear: Through eliminating dead breath, I am purified of bad karma, obscu-rations, sickness, and demons. Inhale slowly, and the upper and lower meet and fill. When holding down becomes uncomfortable, crush. When I can no longer suppress it, I fire it like an arrow. [235] That is called training in the movement of the three secrets, or tra ining in the winds. (Practice 6) Next, \"the dance of the moon's reflection on water\" is training in the drops. Visualize the empty body, the channels, and so on as previously described. The upper end of the central channel continues from the fontanel to the point between the eyebrows. Meditate that the channel terminates in the triangle of bone between the eyebrows. Within it is the nature of the wind­mind condensed into a concentrated, blissful, oi ly, shining, white sphere (bindu ). Practice that visualization combined with the air.

In combination with filling, meditate that [the sphere) resides at the tip of the secret organ as intense, concentrated bliss. Alternatively, in combination with firing like an arrow, [the sphere) goes to the crown of the head, and with the inhalation, it [descends to] rest at the mid-eyebrow point. Train successively in a repeating cycle of these. End the session by dissolv­ing the sphere at the mid-eyebrow point and resting [in meditation]. In order to visualize that, recite : Between the eyebrows is a round, oily, shining, white sphere. Firing like an arrow causes it to ascend to the crown of the head. Inhalation causes it to descend via the central channel to the secret place. The practice of this procedure and its reversal creates bliss. Visualize and practice that. 2. Sta bilizing the Attainment Having described the method fo r controlling the uncontrolled, then there is stabilizing that control. (Practice 7) The physical posture is as before. Begin by practicing as fa r as the train­ing in the wind. Clearly imagine the three channels within your own body, which is the body of the deity as previously visualized. The three channels join to become one single interior at a point fo ur finger-widths below the navel. Between the navel and the secret place, at the level of the abdominal crease, there is a dharmodaya of fire with in the central channel.

It has three undulations and continually wavers, without being still for even an instant. It then increases to two finger­widths [in height), and then to four finger-widths. Train your mind in this [visualization). These features of the sphere can either be practiced in a sepa­rate session or included within the seventh visualization session. The flame, which has the four characteristics of being red and so on and has a wide, stable base and a wavering, fine tip, rises up through the central channel. Focus your mind upon that. THE PRACTICE OF THE SIXFOLD YANTRA It is has been taught that turning the waist to the right and to the left loosens the channel knot of the navel. Twisting the upper body to the right and left loosens the channel knot of the heart. Turning, raising, and lowering the throat loosens the channel knot of the crown of the head. Extending and bending the legs and arms loosens the channel knots of the joints. Shaking and rubbing the body tames all the channels.

These are the instructions for stabilizing the control. 3. In creasing the benefit of that attainrnent This has three sections: a. Increasing the heat b. Increasing the bliss c. Increasing the nonconceptuality The first of those: a. In creasing the heat Even though you've performed the preceding practices, if you don't have a clear visualization of the fire and so on, or in order to make it clearer, first adopt the physical posture as previously described. Alternatively, cross your legs at the ankles with the knees raised up and place the elbows of your crossed arms upon the knees. [237] Place the palms of your hands upon your right and left upper arms. In this \"binding clasp of the knees;' your legs form two triangles of\" opposing hearths.\" Your arms form another four [triangles], making a total of six. There are also six inner and six secret [triangles], mak­ing eighteen \"opposing hearth, mudras. In the visualization, you are the vivid, clear body of the deity with three channels and four cakras, as described earlier. The crown cakra has nine chan­nel petals. It is located at the crown of your head, at the upper extremities of the three channels. The secret cakra has thirty-two channel petals. The twelve cakras of the major joints have eight channel petals each. The cakras of the minor joints have four channel petals each. In this meditation, there is a wisdom-cai)Qali at the junction of the three"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"344 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions channels. It is in the form of a bright and shining globule with its top inside the central channel. Imagine that the effec tive application of wind causes the fire to blaze from the [globule]. Meditate that [the flame] reaches as far as the navel. Turn your stomach six times, turning it to the right and the left. Medi­tate that as a result, [the flame] reaches the heart. Twist your upper body to the right and left. Meditate that as a result, the flame reaches the throat and then the crown of the head. Turn, raise, and lower your throat. Meditate that as a result, the flame spreads to all the limb cakras. Extend and bend your limbs. Meditate that as a result, the flame spreads through the seventy-two thousand channels until it reaches the pores. Shake and rub your body. Imagine that the blazing wisdom fire inciner­ates all the channels that create the basis for samsara, and the channel knots, which cause samsara to be based upon them. Imagine that it incinerates the outer central channel, which acts as the basis for the samsara life force, but not the supreme central channel. In order to imagine all that, recite: The three channels, the six cakras, and the minor cakras are visualized. At the point of junction, the cal).gali blazes. It fills the three principal [channels] and fills the cakras. It spreads as far as the pores and is gathered back again to the junction. Thus, at the conclusion of the session, the flame is gathered back into the basic cal).gali at the channel junction, and you rest in medita­tion. At this point, practice the thirty-seven physical exercises that intensify the result. It is said: Perform the earth-touching mudra and turn the stomach six times-three times to the left and three to the right. Grasp the right knee and perform those same six turns then another six [while grasping] the left [knee].

In creasing the bl iss (Practice 9) To intensify bliss, practice the physical posture, the empty body, and the visu­alization of channels and cakras as you have done before. In this visualiza­tion, within the central channel, in the center of the great-bliss cakra, there is a mandala of nectar, the moon, and bodhicitta in the form of a stainless moon. A white haT{l adorns its center. Within the central channel, in the center of the navel cakra, there is a small caQQili, in the form of a small sphere with the four qualities. While visualiz­ing th is, use the wind practice to create the key effect, so that a flame that is over a finger-width [in height] will blaze. Because of its [heat], the haT{l and moon at the crown become agitated. The hal!l syllable begins to drip bodhi­citta in the form of upside-down haT{l syllables. Then be completely filled with winds so that the flame burns to two finger­widths in height. The bodhicitta falling in the form of upside-down haT{l syl­lables transform into spheres of bodhicitta, the size of mustard seeds. They fall through the central channel like drips falling from an icicle, descending as far as the throat. Imagine that the fire blazes to eight finger-widths above the heart, so that the spheres fall to merge inseparably with the caQ<;lali, instantly transforming into red-hued white spheres that fill the entire body. Rest continuously with a focused mind, with developed bliss, and with­out thought. Recite: As a result of the wind application, the caQ<;lali blazes. Because of that, the moon and haT{l at the crown drip the white element, in the form of spheres. The spheres, which are a mixture of red and white, pervade the entire body. Joy, bliss, and contentment are generated.

The visualization is the same as before except that when the wind practice causes the caQgall's fire to rise in the central channel, immediately upon touching the harrt, red spheres fill the bo dy, and there is pervasive bliss. Then white spheres descend from the ha rrt, and when they reach the flame, it becomes redder and [diminishes to] four finger-widths in height. At that time, the entire body is filled with white spheres ofbodhicitta, so that bliss increases. [239] Imagining that, recite: As a result of the wind practice, the ca.Qgali blazes straight upward. As soon as it touches the haT{l, [the body] is filled with red spheres. Spheres descend from the haT{l, so that the flame subsides, and the entire body is filled with white spheres. Practice that meditation. If that practice does not increase bliss to its full extent, perf orm the following.

Training in the im pure illusory body: attaining that which has not been attained The physical posture is that of the seven Dharmas ofVairocana, as described before. The principal object of meditation is the variety of appearances. The principal time is primarily the day. The meditation is to first contemplate that all composite phenomena are impermanent. In particular, the lives of beings are impermanent. Children, wife, friends, wealth, and so on are all without any essence. In brief, apart from the Dharma, nothing else can bring happiness or benefit. The conclusion of birth is death. The conclusion of accumulation is com­plete dispersal. The conclusion of companionship is separation. The conclu­sion of friendship is enmity. The living body is destroyed. The movement of breath stops. Close relatives are left behind. Others enjoy your wealth and possessions. )our body becomes a corpse. You have no freedom. In brief, nothing has any essence and nothing is necessary. This contemplation, which engenders disillusionment with sam sara, is the mind training that constitutes the preliminary practice. Contemplate how fixation on the reality of all these external appearances, such as form, has caused you to wander in samsara. If you examine and ana­lyze all these appearances, you will see that they are nonexistent, like dreams and illusions. Like echoes and drumbeats, they appear be cause of conditions. They are impermanent, like lightning and water bubbles. They appear and yet have no reality, like mirages and reflections of the moon on water. Meditate well by contemplating in this way.

Training in the pure illusory body Look at a representation of your yidam deity reflected in a mirror. In the same way, your own body is the empty deity's body, devoid of reality. It appears but has no real existence. All beings are bodies of the deities, and all worlds are the \"inconceivable palaces;· and both of these are mere appearances without any reality. Your speech is the sound of the mantra, which is like an echo. The move­ments of your mind are the spontaneous liberation of great bliss, which is like a mirage. Therefore, there is nothing unpleasant or pleasant in the resi­dence, which is the inconceivable palace. There is no aversion or attachment, praise or abuse, for the residents, who are the images of the deities. There is nothing that brings pleasure or pain in the sounds of the mantra. Thinking that, recite: All these forms and appearances, such as my own body, are the deity's body, which is the union of appearance and emptiness, like a reflection. Therefore, how could there be something that would have thoughts of attachment and aversion, praise and criticism, pleasure or pain? Practice that meditation and recitation. In terms of specifics, when stabilizing the understanding through these illusory body visualizations, there should be one session of meditating on the body as being like a reflection in a mirror; one session of going to a place where there are echoes, and meditating that speech is like an echo; and one session of going to a place where there's a mirage and meditating on the mind being like a mirage. This makes a total of three sessions. With the addition of [three sessions on the pure illusory body], there is a total of six. However, practicing four sessions, as taught here, will suffice. 3.

The actual practice of the sp ecial training in the illusory body 1Ju Quintessenu of Nect,zr 351 Rest the three doors as they naturally are, without alteration, in the natural, spontaneously present three solitudes. Holding the wind and mind causes the three visions to arise in their generative sequence. Through the process of their reversal, the illusory body arises. Thinking of this, sit with the legs in the vajra posture, the back as straight as an arrow, the eyes staring fixedly without the complication of opening and closing. When there is no exhalation or inhalation of the breath, there is nei­ther speech, nor the absence of speech. The tongue not touching the lips is the natural, spontaneous presence of vajra repetition. The hands are unmov­ing in the meditation mudr a. In brief, rest in the stable, natural, spontane­ously present solitude of the body. In that state, there is the natural, spontaneously present solitude of the mind, where attention to the past, present, and future has come to rest in equanimity. Rest without any thoughts of existence or nonexistence, empti­ness or no emptiness, meditation or meditator, meditation or no meditation, and so on. While in that state, if a thought begins, don't remain in its continu­ity, but hold all obvious and subtle thoughts in a state without thought and without distraction. If stupor and dullness occur, look upward and sharpen your cognition. If dispersal and agitation occur, look downward and relax your cognition. If there is no dullness or agitation, maintain equanimity. If the beginning of the session is good and the end of the session bad, or if earlier sessions are good and later sessions are bad, this is because the ele­ments are becoming exhausted, like a pond drying up, so revive your ele­ments, relax your mind, and then meditate. If the beginnings of sessions are bad and the ends of the sessions are good, or if the earlier sessions [of the day] are bad and the later sessions are good, this is caused by a lack of diligent application, like an irrigation channel that isn't bringing in water from a lake. Therefore, develop enthusiastic dedication and then meditate.

Maintaining that will cause the wind to be controlled. As a result of that the following experiences will arise: The dis­solving of earth into water causes an appearance that resembles an unstable mirage comprised oflight rays in five colors, alive with little movements like restless water. Water dissolving into fire causes an appearance that resembles the arising and thickening of smoke. Fire dissolving into air causes an appear­ance that resembles fireflies, sparks, and red flashes. Air dissolving into mind causes an appearance that resembles the flames of lamps. The mind dissolving into mental events causes an appearance that resem­bles the radiance of moonlight. When mental events dissolve into ignorance, there is an appearance that resembles the sun. When ignorance dissolves into the \"total empty;' [2.43] there is an appearance that resembles an eclipse, or darkness. That is followed by the \"all empty:· which resembles a cloudless sky (which is taught to be the dharmakaya).m Then, the three visions arise in reverse order: From \"all empty\" arises igno­rance, from which arise mental events, from which arises the mind. From those three and the air arises the illusory body adorned by the primary and secondary signs. It is described by the twelve examples of illusion (which is taught to be the nirmaQakaya). It is directly perceived by self-knowing. You will also see, without obscuration, as clearly as a myrobalan629 in your hand, all pure and impure appearances, all the animate an d inanimate in the three realms and in the three times. That is a brief description of the methods of meditation on the illusory body created by resting in the three solitudes. There is also the method of practicing it with the first three mudras and so on, but I will not describe those here. (Practice 6) b. The practice for enhancing the result of the sp ecial training in the illusory body If you practice in that way and yet have no experiences, or if you th ink that an illusory body could not be created from emptiness, then, in order to develop conviction, perform the enhancing practices : the dark retreat, the lac liquid, the sword, and the mirror .

The third yoga : drearn yoga The instructions that spontaneously clear away the delusions of dreaming are in three parts: 1. Recognition of dreams 2.. Training in dreams 3· Meditation on the true nature of dreams 1. Recognition of dreams This has two aspects : a. Continuous mindfulness during the day b. Recognition by fo rceful means: instructions fo r the nighttime (Practice 1) a. Continuous mindfu lness during the day Enter a strict retreat in a solitary place. Consider how samsaric activities have no essence. Develop great compassion, thinking, \"All beings, my old moth­ers, are wandering in samsara because they don't know that all phenomena are like illusions.\" In all the fo ur kinds of behavior,630 continually develop mindfulness and aspiration with such thoughts as, \"E ma ! All these appearances are like illu­sions, like dreams. I am going to know that this is the way they are. In particu­lar, I shall dream tonight and recognize my dreams to be dreams.\" [ 2.44] (Practice 2) b.

Give your blessing that I may merge into the luminosity of sleep. Give your blessing for my dreams to arise as the illusory body. Recite that supplication numerous times. Develop intense mindfulness, thinking, \"I will tonight recognize sleep as luminosity. My dreams will arise as the illusory body. I will have many clear dreams that will be the basis for arising as the illusory body. I will dream well. I will definitely recognize my dreams. I will know my dreams to be dreams.\" Imagine yourself to be Vajrayogini as during caQ<;lali. Meditate clearly that in your throat is a multicolored lotus with four petals and the anthers in the center. On the center sits a white Or(t. On the front [petal] is a blue a. On the right petal is a yellow nu. On the rear petal is a red ta . On the left petal is a green ra . Recite: I will definitely recognize my dreams. I will know my dreams to be dreams. Upon a multicolored four-petal lotus in my throat, there are five syllables-orrt, a, nu, ta , and ra , which are white, blue, yellow, red, and green in color. Start with that general visualization. Then focus the mind on the a. When you feel like sleeping, focus on the nu. When you are drowsy, focus on the ta. As the drowsiness deepens, focus upon the ra . Then, focus the mind on the orrt and rest in the luminosity of deep sleep. As a result, you will recognize dreams when they come, and be able to use methods in your dream, such as meditation on the deity's body. If at first you don't recognize the dream, as aspiration is the most impor­tant factor for that recognition, intensify your aspiration. Repeating single­minded prayers to the guru and <;lakini will bring recognition of dreams. 2. Tra inin g in dreams This consists of: a. Training in increase and transformation b.

Tonight, when I've recognized that I'm dreaming, I will transform one thing into many and transform the bad things into good, transform my body into the deity, and so on.\" Go to sleep with that aspiration. Recognize the dream and think, \"This dream has no reality, so I can do whatever I like.\" You can transform yourself from a human into a bird, and so on. If you're having a nightmare, you can transform it int o a good dream. [245] You can meditate that your body is the illusory body of the deity, transforming into Cakrasarpvara, Hevajra, and so on. You can have many different hands and faces and transform one thing into many things and many things into one thing. In order to train in these manifestations and transformations, develop a strong aspiration as you go to sleep by reciting these words: Dreams are unreal, they are illusions. Therefore, I will recognize that I am dreaming and will perform whatever manifestations and transformations I wish, such as changing one into many and becoming various deity bodies. (Practice 4) b. Tra ining in illusion If in a dream you see frightening things, such as a fire, a great river, a preci­pice, enemies, dangerous animals, and so on, don't be afraid, but train in illu­sion. Think, \"If this dream is a nonexistent appearance, without reality, who can be burned by this fire? Who can be swept away by this river? Who can be harmed by these enemies? Who can be devoured by these wild animals? Who can fall down this pr ecipice? This is unreal, like an illusion, so knowing that all these appearances are illusions, I will not be afraid but will train [in illusion].\" Develop that aspiration and recite: All the places, appearances, fire, water, poison, weapons, and so on that are in a dream do not have any reality as this or that thing; they are all illusions, devoid of reality.

Training in supramundane liberation (Practice s) i. Tra ining in mundane liberation Develop the following motivation as you fall asleep: As I can do anything with my dream body, I will go to see the details of many places, such as the paradises, [the continent of) Kuru, and the lower existences, which easily create disillusionment with samsara. Develop that aspiration, go to sleep, recognize yo u're dreaming, and then take hold of a sunbeam and go to see a deva realm. Train in going to see other continents, the lower existences, India, and so on. (Practice 6) ii. Tra ining in supra mundane liberation When training in supramundane liberation, it's important during the day to habituate yourself to aspiring for it. [246] Therefore, in a solitary place, in the same physical posture as for the caQ<;lali, visualize yourself to be the yidam deity. Visualize that in your heart there is a wisdom being (intinasatfvtl) an inch in height. Encourage yourself by thinking, .. I will now leave my body and go to the realms of the buddhas.\" Then your mind, which is the wisdom being, exits your body, which is the commitment being (sama_yasattva ), ascends to a great height until you reach the realm of Ghanavyuha.

Then think, \"Now I've accomplished my goal and will return to my commitment being body.\" Then you return to it in the way that a wisdom being enters a commitment being. It's very important to do this training at the beginning. Recite: Self-kn owing, the wisdom being, exits from my body, the commitment-being_yidam. I meet a buddha in the pure real ms, receive his teaching, and return to my body. Similarly, train in going to the eastern buddha realm and so on. (Practice 7) Having trained in that way during the day, when you go to sleep at night, think again and again, \"Tonight I will recognize that I'm dreaming, and I will train in seeing the realm of Buddha Vairocana.\" Recite: I will perfectly recognize that I'm dreaming and in an illusory body will see sugatas in the buddha realms, hear their teaching, and receive their prophecies. Focus your mind on the O??Z and train in the realm of Vairocana. Focus your mind on the a and train in the realm of Alqobhya. Focus on nu for Rat­nasambhava. Focus on ta for Amitabha. Focus on ra in order to train in and to see the realm of Amoghasiddhi. In the same way by first developing the wish to go to that particular place and then training in it, go and join the gatherings of <;lakinis in the twenty­four sacred places, go to O<;l<;liyana, Shambhala, and so on. When you do this practice, at first [the realm]' will be ind istinct. Then it will become more vivid, until finally you will be able to see it exactly as it is. 3. Meditation on the true nature of dreams [ 2.4 7] All phenomena are primordially illusions, like dreams.

D. The fourth yoga : luminosity In the instructions for the luminosity that dispels the darkness of ignorance, there are two parts: 1. Bringing daytime appearances into luminosity 2. Remaining in the luminosity of nighttime's deep sleep 1. Bringing daytime appearances into luminosity Seat yourself in the same physical posture as for the car:u;iali. Keep yourself straight with the meditation staff and the meditation belt. Focus upon the urna hair631 or upon space, and meditate nonconceptually. If you cannot rest in that state, contemplate a blue hurrt upon a lotus and sun disc in the heart of yourself visualized as Vajrayoginl. Light rays radiate from it so that all worlds merge into the beings that inhabit them. Then the beings merge into you. Then you, as the deity, melt from the crown protru­sion (u$�i$at'� downward and from the soles of the feet upward, dissolving into the hu1p. The hu1'{l's shabkyuc.u dissolves into the ha. The ha dissolves into its head, which dissolves into the cr escent, which dissolves into the circle, which dissolves into the ndda. Imagining that, hold the vase breath and rest in a nonconceptual state. If there is stupor or instability, meditate on being the _yidam deity as before and keep repeating over and over the stages of dissolving into the ndda. That meditation will cause the winds of the sun, moon, and eclipse to be fixed in the heart, and after the three visions there will be the recognition ofluminos­ity. Theretore, diligently apply yourself to this practice. Recite: In the heart of myself visualized as the Yogin!, there is a blue hii'!J upon a lotus and sun."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"7hr Quintesunce of Nect,zr 3S9 Its light causes the worlds and their beings to merge into me. I merge into the hi\"urz, which is absorbed into the nddtl . Practice that meditation. 2. Remaining in the lurninosity oj'nighttime's deep sleep In a solitary place, train well in the daytime training that has previously been described, becoming familiarized with it. Place the body, speech, and mind at ease. [ 248] For a little while aban­don all other activity. For two or three nights, without sleeping, apply your­self to virtuous activity as much as you can. Eat nutritious food and massage the body. Offer tormas adorned with human flesh to the gurus,yidams, and <;lakin is. Repeat twenty-one times, or as many times as you can, the aspiration of thinking, \"I shall definitely recognize the luminosity of sleep.\" Lie down in the lion po sture with your head pointing to the north and make yourself as comfortable as you can. Visualize yourself as the yidam deity. In your heart, inside the central channel, there is a four-petal blue lotus. In its center, upon the anthers, there is a blue hurrz. On the four petals there is a white a on the front petal, a yellow nu on the right petal, a red ta on the rear petal, and a green ra on the left pet al. Visualize this clearly and recite: I am visualized as Sahaja, at the heart, within the central channel, upon a lotus, there is a very clear hurrz, a, nu, ta , and ra , which are blue, white, yellow, red, and green. Visualize that and gently hold the vase breath. First, be aware of the a in front. Then be aware of the nu as you approach appearance. Be aware of the ta when you approach increase. Be aware of the ra as outer appearances dissolve, you merge into emptiness, and there is the vision of attainment.63 .. Having begun to realize these four empties,b1s when the sign of the all empty, which is the fifth enlightenment,611' begins to appear, focus your mind upon the central hurrz and recognize the supreme, change­less luminosity and rest in that recognition. That is the unsurpassable teaching of the Kagyi.i Karma Kamtsang, but if you are having difficulty , as in the case of a beginner, recognizing the arising of the \"awakening\" and its signs, then when you go to sleep, think again and"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"360 Afahamudra and Related Instructions again, \"I am going to recognize the luminosity of sleep tonight!\" Then, as in the daytime practice, imagine yourself to be the yidam deity and dissolve into the hurrz. The hurrz is then absorbed into a blue sphere (hindu) the size of a pea. Focus your mind on that as you go to sleep. As a result, between the time that [daytime] perceptions cease and dreams appear, you will be in a light sleep that is a clear and nonconceptual state. Have a friend make a signal as a test to see if you have the recognition of luminosity. There will eventually be a blending ofthat recognition with clarity and emptiness, and with bliss and emptiness. Rest the mind in that. Recite: In the heart of myself visualized as Yogini, there is a blue hit'f(l upon a lotus and sun. Its light causes the worlds and their beings to me rge into me. I merge into the hit'f(l, which is absorbed into a sphere. [249] In order to recognize the luminosity of deep sleep, you may also focus your mind upon a blue sphere inside a jewel. If you wish to recognize the lumi­nosity of light sleep, meditate that [the sphere] is at the mid-eyebrow point, where the upper opening of the central channel is. It's easier to recognize [the luminosity] if you focus your mind on a black sphere, the size of a sheep's dropping, at that place. Those are the methods for recognizing what has not been recognized. Particularly according to Lord Yangchen,637 that recognition is stabilized when the power of the blazing caQQali in the central channel, as in the ear­lier caQgali yoga, melts the bodhicitta and there is the realization of bliss and emptiness and the special wind-mind signs of the three visions and luminos­ity. From that the illusory body arises, which is the manifestation of true luminosity. Two methods cause the very subtle wind,-mind to enter the lumi­nosity. The two methods are: a. Totality b. Subsequent dissolution a. To ta li�y Make your own body, speech, and mind indivisible from that of all beings. Meditate that your physical aspect is Vairocana, the vocal aspect is Amitabha, and the mental aspect is A.lqobhya. These are the commitment beings."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"1hr Quinusunce �(Nutar 361 Imagine that in their hearts there are, respectively, O'fl, al;, and hu'fl, which are the wisdom beings. Meditate that within the circles of each of these three syllables there is a short a with an indestructible sound. Then the OTfl, ab. and huTfl seed syllables in the hearts radiate light. The commitment beings dissolve from the crowns of their heads downward and from the soles of the feet upward into the wisdom beings in their hearts. The wisdom deities then gradually dissolve into the samadhi beings (samadhisattvas ), which are the indestructible quintessences: the [three] short a with their sound. Then those samadhi beings dissolve into a concen­trated point ofluminosity, and the mind rests without distraction. If this visualization is clear, then do just one session. If it isn't clear, do one session each of\"totality\" for the body, speech, and mind. Recite: The body aspect, and the others, of the indivisibility of the three doors of all beings and myself is visualized as Vairocana and the others. In their hea rts are 01fl and so on, within each of which there is a short a with its sound, from which lights radiate, causing them to dissolve from the outside inward, merging into a con­centrated point.

The subsequent dissolution Lights from the seed syllable in your heart cause the worlds and beings to melt into a mass of light that is absorbed into yourself After that, the medi­tation of the three beings is the same as in \"totality.\" The wind-mind then reappears from that state as the body of the dei ty. This is what is called the arising of the illusory body ftom the luminosity. In order to visualize that, recite: Lights from the seed syllable in the heart cause the worlds and beings to melt. In the form of light, they merge into me. The commitment deities that are my body, speech, and mind are gradually merged into a sphere oflight. That was the description of the meditation stages of the luminosity. E. The fift h yoga : the bardo The teachings on the spontaneous liberation of the bardo is in three parts: 1. The first bardo : the manifestation of the dharmakaya 2. The second bardo: the illusory body arising as the deity's body 3· The third bardo: closing the doorways to rebirth in the six existences"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"The Quintessence of Nectar 363 1. The .first bardo: the manifestation of the dharmakdya A practitioner who is about to undergo the experience of dying should think, \"If things were truly real, then death would be impossible. However, I can see that there is death and destruction. Therefore, things are not real. This means that death, too, is an appearance that has no reality.\" Thus the practitioner should think nothing of death. Donate your possessions to the Three Jewels and avoid sorrowful friends, relatives, and so on who would distract your meditation. If you can, sit in the same physical posture as in the Ca.t).Qali practice. If you can't, adopt the lion posture. Focus your mind on the guru and the Three Jewels. Develop fa ith fr om the depth of your heart and take refuge in an exceptional manner. Again and again, develop an intense determination, thinking, \"Through death, I will realize the true nature, the luminosity, the ultimate truth. Then, for the sake of all beings, I will manifest the level of the union mahamudra in the bardo ofbecoming.\" When you are dying, the perception of the eyes will dissolve, so that fo rms become unclear. The perception of the ears will dissolve, so that sounds will not be heard. The perception of the nose will dissolve, so that there will be no smell. The perception of the tongue dissolves, so that you will have no sensa­tion of taste. The perceptions of the body will dissolve, so that physical sen­sations will be dulled. Earth will dissolve into water, and your body will become powerless. Water will dissolve into fire, and your mouth and nose will become dry. Fire [251] will dissolve into air, so that the warmth of your body will shrink. Air will dissolve into consciousness, so that your external breath will stop, although your internal breath will continue fo r a little while. At that first instant, there will be the appearance, with an inner sign, which resembles smoke, and an outer sign, which resembles moonlight. In the sec­ond [instant], there will be increase, with an inner sign, which resembles fire­Aies, and an outer sign, which resembles sunlight. In the th ird instant, there will be attainment, with an inner sign, which resembles lamp Aames, and an outer sign, which resembles darkness.

There will be an outer sign, which is like the appearance of dawn, and an inner sign, which is your consciousness resem­bling a cloudless !tky. There will be nonconceptual luminosity, which tran­scends the intellect and has no center or edge. At that time, the lumino�ity of meditation in this lite will encountc:r the"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"364 Mahamudra and Related Instructions natural luminosity, like the meeting between a mother and her son. Resting in that causes the eighty conceptualizations to cease and the nonconceptual elaboration-free luminosity, the dharmakaya, to manifest. Arising from that as the illusory body, is the training union. In order to visualize the first bardo, recite: For the sake of all my old mothers, the six classes of beings, at the time of death, after the dissolving of appearance, increase, and attainment, I will see the mind that is the meeting of the mother and son luminosities, the face of the natural, nonconceptual dharmakaya. Repeat that meditation and recitation with intense aspiration. 2. The second bardo: the illusory body arising as the deity's body If the first bardo alone does not bring liberation, you will en ter the second bardo. The movement of thought mounted on the winds causes attainment, with its seven natures, to appear from the state of luminosity. From that attainment comes increase. From increase comes appearance. From appearance come air, fire, water, and earth. From these the complete sensory faculties manifest and the bardo body, which can move anywhere unimpeded, is created. Rest in luminosity for as long as you can. When the reverse process of the three visions begins, develop the intention to arise as the illusory body in the bardo. In order to visualize this in the present, recite: If the luminosity of the first bardo is left behind and the appearances of the second bardo arise, at that time I will arise as the superior deity's body, the illusory body in the bardo. Develop that intention now, so that when the reverse process of the three visions is completed and the second bardo is created, you will appear as the illusory body ofVajrayogini.

The third bardo: closing the doorwa_ys to rebirth in the six existences If those previous practices have not brought you to the supreme state, then the third bardo, such as the appearance of the womb, will appear. Meditate that your future mother is Vajrayogini and your future father is Heruka. Turning away from desire, close the womb's door. Choose the womb of prac­titioners who are vidyadharas of the Mantrayana, a father and mother that you can take to be your own gurus. When you are being reborn into that womb, pray to the guru as father and mother for the higher empowerments. 639 The bodhicitta of the guru father and mother will blend, and you will experience bliss and wisdom. At this time, recognize the realization of the secret empowerment and know the guru father and mother to be your yidam deity. Maintaining the realization of the five awakenings, become a nirmaQakaya through birth, which is just a visual illusion: a wisdom illusion with wisdom as its cause. In a state of meditation in which you are thinking in this way, take possession of the womb. In order to develop in this life the intention to attain that, recite: If in the second bardo, the body of union is not accomplished, then at that time I will see my future parents as deities and abandon desire. I will choose a womb and knowingly be reborn. Repeat that recitation and meditation. This was a brief description of the stages of visualization in the bardo prac­tice. If those three practices are not effective, you must dedicate your good karma and seal it with a prayer of aspiration so that you will have a pure rebirth.

Reciting hik kd another seven times causes the a to rise directly upward until it touches the guru's feet. Then, release the breath and recite kd hik twenty-one times, caus­ing the a to descend to the lotus below the navel. In order to visualize that, recite: I am visualized as the dei ty.

The application to activity Even if the signs of dying have appeared, do whatever you can, using var­ious methods, to prevent death. If nothing succeeds in preventing death, repair any impairment of your vows and commitments, donate the things and implements that you own to the Three Jewels, perform a gar)acakra with companions who have kept the commitments, place an image of your yidam deity before you, and set out an arrangement of offerings. Practice the same visualization as previously described, except that this time, the four yarrz.s are imagined as bow-shaped mandalas of air that cause the syllable to rise. It ascends as before but then merges into the heart of Vajradhara. Practice that visualization and repeat the recitation with the first two lines unchanged but the rest modified: I am visualized as the deity. Within the lower end of the central channel, upon a lotus, is my mind as an a. It is lifted by air so that it merges into the heart of the guru at the crown of my head, becoming indivisible in one taste. This is called the nirmdr)akdya transference of consciousness.

III. 1he conclusion [of this text on the six yogas} This is in four parts: A. Eliminating obstacles B. Increasing the benefit C. The way the paths are traversed D. The way the results are attained A. Eliminating obstacles If the breathing practice is too forceful during the breathing exercises, or if the key points of the breathing practices were not understood, the life-force wind may reverse and so on. If these obstacles occur, correct them by speak­ing with your teacher in person. A smell comes up while you are washing a bowl, and in the same way, at this time there arise the five mind-poisons and the bad results that we would otherwise experience in other lifetimes in the six existences. Therefore, you will experience a great increase in physical pain, negativity in the mind, [255) and so on. At such a time, meditate on the illusory body and emptiness. Bring these experiences into the path through such practices as the .five nails.6-f1 In particular, there are many into whom the demon of pride enters because of the qualities they have developed through meditating on the path of method. Therefore, a thought such as, \"There is nothing like this, even in the Buddha's mind;' should be brought to rest in an elaboration-free state and become blended in one taste. Do not be premature in working to ben­efit others. In brief, there are many obstacles to the teachings of the caQ9ali short a and its ancillaries, such as the illusory body, and it is difficult to know how to avoid them."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"370 Mahamudra and Related Instructions When the wind is held in the channel knots or in other places, every kind of experience can occur. If, in response to those experiences, you have suffer­ing, arrogance, hope, or fear, those experiences will become obstacles to you. Therefore, avoid falling under the power of these obstacles by relying on the nectar that comes from the mouth of the sacred guru. B. In creasing the benefit Develop a continuity, like that of a river, of faith in the guru, compassion for beings, diligence free oflaziness, a perfect knowledge of the methods, a stable meditation in solitude, and so on. Rely on your guru's words until you have attained stability. Those with inferior and medium capabilities, who practice bliss through the symbolic mudra, should increase benefit through an action seal, a con­sort who has the necessary qualities, or through a primordial seal, which is an imagined consort. They should follow a conduct that accords with [the level of] their [attainment of] heat. Those with sharp capabilities, who can practice the supreme emptiness mudra and so on, should follow the conduct of the bhusuka(yu and increase results through the mahamudra. In brief, results are increased by practicing in accord with individual's level, the three conducts taught in the father tantras, and the conduct taught in the mother tantras. In general, results are increased by keeping qualities secret. Don't be premature in your wish to be a lama and your claim to ben­efit beings. You can learn the details of this from your own guru. C. The way the paths are traversed On the first path of accumulation, the afflictions and thoughts that cause results in other lifetimes are brought onto the path when the cat:t<;lali fire incinerates the five seeds of the mind- poisons, which are located in the impure body's five places. On the second path of accumulation, those results, and also sickness and demons, are brought onto the path. On the third path of accumulation, the continuum of rebirth is brought into the path and cut through. On the fourth path of accumulation, impure bliss, clarity, non­thought, and emptiness are brought into the path. The first path of engagement is training in the path of absorbing the wind­mind into the five cakras. [256] On the second path of engagement, the"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"7he Quintes sence �{Nectar �71 retention of wind-mind within countless channels is brought into the path. On the third path of engagement, there is engagement with the first truth as the result of immaculate bliss. clarity. nonthought, and emptiness being brought [onto the path]. The fourth path of engagement is retention of the immaculate winds of the five elements as wisdom winds. The fifth path of engagement is when great bliss and great emptiness arise alternately. There is the traversal of the path of seeing. which is the first level [of enlightenment] ( bhumi), named Perfect Joy. which is when you first see the previously unseen one-taste of bliss and emptiness. There is the traversal of the first and other paths of meditation, which continue up to the twelfth level, named Attachment-Free Lotus, in parallel with the upward traversal of the vital energy and so on, until the [path] of completion is attained. D. The way the result is attained This is a conclusive presentation of the results. The general siddhis or results: The cessation of the winds of the five elements within the central channel causes the five, ten, or more signs, such as smoke. Countless qualities appear in the body, speech, and mind. The general siddhis, such as the four activities and the eight siddhis, are also attained. In this way you attain, bring under your power, and increase the mundane siddhis. When the paths have been fully traversed, you attain the supreme siddhi, the thirteenth stage, or the Vajradhara stage, and attain the state of a Vajra­dhara. There is the manifestation of the sarpbhogakaya with the seven aspects of union.643 There will be the dance of the inexpressible, inconceivable, illu­sory network of emanations. Existence is purified within the heart of enlight­enment. In brief, the unique state of Buddha Vajrasattva, the great lord of all the buddha families, will be made manifest. This concludes a brief description of the visualization sessions of the six yogas of glorious Naropa. I don't have the experience of meditation, so it's difficult for me to teach the nature of the path to others, but I have conviction in the excellent teaching of my tutors, and in the practice lineage: the unsurpassable Karma Kamtsang.

The Structural Analysis that Classifies the Sequence of the Seven Chapters In the third of the eight parts of the outline [of the Single Viewpoint] is a section on the seven chapters in which they are said to be similar to the two wheels in the Mahayana's Sublime Co ntinuum. Therefore, there is no error in teaching the seven chapters here in accordance with that sequence. How­ever, it's taught that the chapters on the three vows are definitive, so some of its teaching will be combined here. The Mahayana's Sublime Co ntinuum Tr eatise is definitively divided into two uwheels\": 1. The wheel of the resultant Jewels 2. The wheel of unlocated nirvana The Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, which are the first three of [that trea­tise's] \"seven vajra points,\" are the wheel of the resultant jewels. The Dharmas of the path are the conditions necessary for awakening the stained \"element\" (dhatu)696 so that enlightenment, qualities, and activities are manifested. These are the wheel of unlocated nirvana. From Nagarjuna's A Praise to the Dharmadhatu: Through eliminating that which is the cause of samsara, there is the purity, nirvana, which is also the dharmakaya. \"')' The cause of samsara is the alaya consciousness, which has all seeds and is completely stained by propensities fo r aggregates, [sensory] elements, and [sensory] bases. When that is purified by the Dharma of the Buddha, which accords with being the cause of nonconceptual wisdom, this purification through stages is called the unlocated nirvana. This is also the dharmakaya of all buddhas. This is the explanation that has been taught by paJ)�itas."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"1Ju Single l'irurpoint: A Root Trxt 399 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO WHEELS First, one begins with the Three Jewels [ 282] fo r many reasons, such as that they engender joy in the result and give refuge on entering into the path.

Also, there is the analy­sis of the subsequent result: Through purifying the causal \"element,\" the fa c­tors of enlightenment, qualities, and activity become manifest, and these are the wheel of unlocated nirvana. If one considers stainless enlightenment and the resultant Jewels as inseparable, then the qual ities and activity are those of the Three Jewels. As in that example, if one teaches the seven chapters starting with the one on view, conduct, (and meditation),698 the order will be the three trainings/''�'� the Dharma wheel,:-oo interdependence,\"'01 and the level of buddhahood/02 and then [all seven] would be the same as the wheel of the unlocated ntrvana.

Bright eons are those in which buddhas appear; dark eons are those in which buddhas do not appear. A thousand buddhas will appear in this bright eon, which is named the Good Eon. After sixty-five dark eons have then passed, ten thousand bud­dhas will appear in a bright eon named the Greatly Renowned Eon.

According to the Hinayana, buddhas appear only during a period when the lifespan is diminishing from eighty thousand years down to a hundred. They do not appear before that period because the beings of that time have little sorrow and are uninterested in the Dharma. The buddhas do not appear afi:er that period because then the five degenerations have become too strong. The buddhas do not need to appear during the period when the lifespan is increasing, because during that time there is a natural avoidance of bad actions and increase in the power of good actions. However, this Hinayana teaching is not certain. According to the Sutra of the Good Eon, Krakucchanda appeared within this eon when beings had a forty-thousand-year lifespan; Kanakamuni appeared when they had a thirty-thousand-year lifespan; Kasyapa appeared when they had a twenty-thousand-year lifespan; and Sakyamuni appeared when beings had a hundred-year lifespan. B. The way in which our Buddha in particular appeared This is in three parts: 1. The Hinayana tradition 2. The general Mahayana tradition 3. The Vajrayana tradition 1. The Hinaydna tradition of how the Buddha app eared In a past life, the Buddha was King Prabhavan.

Then during one incalculable eon, he served seventy-five thousand buddhas, beginning with a Buddha Sakyamuni and ending with Rantasikhin. During a second incalculable eon, he served seventy-six thousand buddhas ending with Diparpkara. During a third incalculable eon, he served seventy-seven thousand buddhas, ending with Vipasyin. Thus, he accumulated merit for three incalculable eons. Then he praised Buddha Pu�ya with a verse that he repeated continuously for seven days. This [created the merit] equivalent to nine eons of merit accu­mulation.

The general Mahayana tradition of how the Buddha appeared How THE BUDDHA FIRST DEVELOPED BODHICITTA The Buddha taught in the Sutra of Repaying the Kindnes/08 that he had been reborn as a strong man in hell, where he pulled a cart across red-hot iron ground. A hell guardian was continually beating his weak companion. The Buddha had affection fo r his companion and said to the hell guardian, \"Have some pity on him!\" This made the guardian furious, and he stabbed the Bud­dha with a trident, ending his life. This purified the Buddha ofhundreds709 of eons' worth of bad karma. In a later life, the Buddha was Bhaskara, the son of a potter.

From that life onward, he accumulated merit throughout one incalculable eon and reached the first [bodhisattva] level. He was then born as the merchant leader Prajnabhadra and served Bud­dha Ratnanga. From that life onward, he accumulated merit fo r another incalculable eon and reached the seventh level.

THE HIGHEST YOGA MOTHER TANTRA OF SRi HEVAJRA According to the commentary to the Vaj ra Ga rland [ Ta ntra], the nirmarya­kaya Buddha taught the Hevajra tantra when he subjugated the four maras in Magadha in this world ofJambudvipa.747 [When the tantra says that the Buddha was] in \"the bhaga (vagina) of the vajra queen,\" this means in the dharmoday a (\"source of phenomena\"). The Bhagavan Buddha, encircled by a great following of mundane and supra­mundane beings, was residing within a divine palace within the dharmoday a. Upon the request ofVajragarbha, Nairatmya, and others, the Buddha taught the long root tantra, and on the request ofVajragarbha, he taught the short tantra, [thus teaching] the Tw o Books [of the Hevajra Ta ntra ].748 In the cen­ter of the divine palace, the Buddha taught the explanatory tantra, the Vaj ra Tent,-49 to the deities who maintain the five cakras and to his supramundane and mundane fo llowers. THE WAY IN WHICH THE VAJ RAYANA CANON WAS COMPILED Some commentaries state that the compilers of the tantras were those who requested the tantras and those to whom the tantras were finally entrusted. For example, Vaj rapaQi compiled the SaT{lvarabhuta Tantra, Vajragarbha and Vaj ra<;lakini Varahi compiled the Tw o Books ojthe Hevajra Ta ntra , and Sucan­dra compiled the Kalacakra. There are other teachings also, for example that the Buddha taught summarized tantras, which are summaries of the long root tantras, in which case the Buddha himself is their compiler. However, the teaching that VajrapaQi compiled all the Mantrayana tantras is good.

Those who did not attain siddhi became humans. The land became renowned as the residence of <;iakinis. [294] Eventually the Mantrayana spread from there into Madhyadda.��n It is also said that [the Buddha] gave the empowerments to King Indrabo­dhi in Alakavati, and then, because of a supplication by a gathering of 96 mil­lion bodhisatrvas, VajrapaQ.i compiled and wrote out every single Mantrayana tantra. Vajrapa.Qi then gave the empowerments and entrusted the tantras to the <;iak.inis in O<;i<;iiyana, who previously had been nagas, instructing them to give the tantras to worthy ones in future generations. Also, in the commentary to the root tantra of Cakrasarpvara, which was written by-King Indrabodhi, it says: He orally and secretly turned the Dharma wheel of the supreme Vajrayana fo r King lndrabodhi and his retinue, giving them the empowerments, blessings, and Dharma of the highest great secret teaching. Eventually, at a later time, the compiler of the scriptures, in an assembly of 96 million great bodhisatrvas and others, within the great palace of Alakavati, . the supreme paradise on the northeast of Mount Meru, compiled every single tantra. Thus did I hear, when they supplicated Lord Guhyapati: \"Write down the supreme teaching using lapis lazuli pigment upon pages of gold.\" Then, considering the times yet to come, [Vajrapi.Q.i] blessed the community of <;iakinis in the land of O<;i<;iiyana, who had previously been nagas.

From the Ocean ojl)dkas: The compilers and the rest came to me and received them. All the matrikas gathered together and compiled all the vajra points. They explained them to each other, prayed, and composed prayers/52 Therefore, in general, though Guhyapati was the compiler [of the tantras], there were other compilers. For example, King Sucandra compiled the Kalacakra [teaching] as the root cancra of twelve thousand verses. How­ever, subsequently, after the passing of the seven Dharmarajas/53 [295] Maiijusriklrti Kalki compiled the summarized Kdla cakra Tantra. THE DURATION OF THE VAJRAYANA It is said that the Vajrayana will continue for as long as the Buddha's teachings last. From the Manjufri Root Tantra: After the supreme Sage is no longer present, if you always have faith in the recitation of mantra, the benefit of the teachings will be accomplished.7s\"' From the Great Power [Sutra]: When these sutras are completely extinct, the entire teachings of the T athagata will be extinct. 1�� From Orallhuumission: It is perf ectly explained char fo r as long as those who pass on [the caner as)"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Light Rtt)'s_from thrJrwrl ofthr Exullent Teafhin._e: 417 remain in this [world], that is how long the precious teaching of the Buddha will remain.

B. A teaching on the arra ngement of the vehicles This is in two parts: 1. A presentation of the vehicles in general 2. A presentation of the Vajrayana in particular 1. A presentation of the t'ehicles in general All the eighty-four thousand entrances to the Dharma and so on, which the Buddha taught to the three kinds of pupils-superior, middling, and inferior-can be summarized as three vehicles: the Sravaka Ve hicle, the Pratyekabuddha Ve hicle, and the Mahayana. From the White Lotus Sutra: The Great Rishi taught three vehicles. Skilled in the methods of guiding, he taught the three vehicles fo r the benefit ofbeings.7s8"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"418 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions The Sravaka Ve hicle and the Pratyekabuddha Ve hicle, which are collectively called the Hinayana, were taught to beings with inferior understanding who were weary of samsara but unable to train in the highest training. [2.96) This way they could still rest temporarily on the level of the lesser nirvana. From the White Lotus Sutra: Thus, although all the sravakas consider that they attain nirvana, the Buddha has taught that they are not in nirvana but are just resting.759 Therefore, the only vehicle that leads to perfect buddhahood is the Maha­yana. It is the ultimate vehicle and greatly superior to the other vehicles. From the En try into Lanka Sutra: I have said that there is only one single vehicle and that there is no arrangement of vehicles, but I have taught that there are different vehicles in order to guide the immature.760 From the White Lotus Sutra : There is only one vehicle in this world. There are not two and there are never three, except that supreme beings teach a variety of vehicles as a method/61 From Compendium of the Mahayana: It is superior because of its knowledge, the qualities that are gained, the causes and results, the categories, the three trainings, the resulting elimination, and because it is the supreme vehicle ofwisdom.�62 The Mahayana has also been taught to have two vehicles: (•) the general Mahayana, or Perfection Ve hicle, and ( 2.) the Mantrayana, or Vajrayana. These were taught for two kinds of pupils: (•) those who had inferior minds and aspired to use causes as the path, and (2.) those with supreme minds and"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Light Ra_ys from the jewel ofthe Excellent Teaching 419 aspired to use the result as the path.

A presentation of the Vaj rayana in particular Both the vehicles of cause and of result will attain the same result, but the Mantrayana is superior because of the fo ur ways of traveling the path. From the Lamp of the Three 1%ys: There is no ignorance of even a single meaning; it has many methods; it is not difficult; and it is intended fo r those with sharp faculties. That is why the Mantrayana is superior.765 THERE IS NO IGNORANCE IN THE MANTRAYANA In the Perfection Vehicle there is the practice of external perfections, such as giving away your head, legs, and arms. It takes you a long time to fulfill the desires of all beings, because you cannot fulfill them instantaneously. There� fo re, there is some ignorance in the Perfection Ve hicle. [297] The mantrikas reject such methods and use skillful methods. They develop compassion fo r endless beings and quickly complete the six perfec­tions through the internal samadhi that is the inseparability of method and wisdom. Therefore, there is no ignorance in the Mantrayana. From Lamp of the Three rVays : The wisdom that has great compassion discriminates and adopts the supreme method."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"420 Mahtimudr,i and Related Instructions It rejects ordinary methods and attains the changeless state.�c.c. THE MANTRAYANA HAS MANY METHODS Perfection Ve hicle practitioners use only hardships, vows, and so on as meth­ods fo r attaining buddhahood, but everyone cannot be nurtured through these alone because not everyone is able to practice these alone. Therefore, the Perfection Ve hicle has few methods. Mantrayana practitioners, in order to accomplish the benefit of all beings, first identify their buddha families through examining dreams, casting a flower, and so on and then engage in the corresponding practices. The Mantrayana has many methods, including the subtleties of meditating on mind and men­tal events as having the nature of the deity and so on. There is mantra repeti­tion and so on for those unable to practice the subtleties and have attachment to vocal elaboration. There is meditation on the mandala's residence and resi­dents and so on fo r those who have attachment to evident objects of percep­tion and cannot engage in subtleties. There is also liberation through realizing that there are no afflictions to eliminate, nor wisdom to attain, because all phenomena are completely pure by nature. From Lamp of the Ihree u-ays: The teacher of beings taught the supreme path in fo ur categories, which contains all methods, to those with great intelligence in order to accomplish excellent benefit fo r all beings.767 TH E MANTRAYANA IS FREE OF DIFFICULTY Methods for attaining the result that also accord with the individual desires of pupils are rare in the Perfection Vehicle, and so enlightenment is attained with difficulty over a long period of time. Therefore, the Perfection Vehicle has great hardships. Mantrikas correctly apply [the teaching] to any being in any place at any time, and for whatever length of time is desired. They manifest the result by using easy methods, so that bondage is transformed into liberation. They attain enlightenment easily through the methods, such as the four mudras, that agree with a person's level of capability. Theref ore, the Mantrayana has no hardship. From Lamp o_(tbe Ihree H{lys: [The teaching] is precisely applied to that which people desire."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Light R,z_vsfrom the Jewel o_lthe Excellent Teaching 421 The Sage thus taught the sacred meaning that brings the attainment of the desired goal.-(·M TH E MANTRAYANA IS FOR THOSE WITH SHARP FACULTIES Hinayana [practitioners] do not know the method, and therefore they have blunt faculties. (298) Perfection Ve hicle practitioners are mistaken con­cerning the method, and therefore they have medium faculties. Through special methods, the mantrika is able to transform into causes of enlight­enment those actions that would send anyone else into the lower realms. Therefore, the Mantrayana is fo r those with sharp faculties. According to Aryadeva: The inferior ones have attachment to three things; the medium ones become free from attachment; the wise ones, who have knowledge of the nature of form, become liberated.769 Elimination of the Two Extreme/70 states that the Mantrayana is superior because of these fo ur [qualities]: swift methods, easy methods, many meth­ods, and skill in methods. THE MANTRAYANA IS SUPERIOR BECAUSE OF ITS \" n SWIFT METHODS In the Perfection Ve hicle you have to practice the path fo r three incalcu­lable eons and so on in order to attain the result, so its methods are slow. The mantrikas attain the result in one, seven, or sixteen lifetimes. Therefore, the Mantrayana has swift methods. Those with the best faculties and dili­gence achieve buddhahood within their lifetimes. From the Kdlacakra Root Tantra: If illiterate untouchables and so on and those who have perpetrated the five worst actions practice the Mantrayana, they will become buddhas within their lifetimes.--1 From the Guhyasamdja Tantra: The great nature of this Dharma comes from the indivisible three kayas."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"422 l'vlahdmudrd and Related Instructions It is an adornment of the ocean of wisdom.

C. An explanation of the categories of the teachings [ 29 9] This is in two parts: 1. The general, simple classification of scripture and realization 2. The presentation of the tantras 1. The general, simple classification of scripture and realization In general, the Dharma is comprised of the Dharma of scripture and the Dharma of realization. From Tr easury of the Abhidharma: The Te acher's Dharma is twofold: It consists of scripture and realization.777 a. The Dharma ofscripture The Dharma of scripture is the excellent speech that communicates the teach­ings that describe the Dharma of realization. One can categorize it into word (vacana) and treatise (fdstra). From the Sutra Requested by Devaputra : All Dharmas can be categorized as either vacana or fdstra­the [Buddha's] excellent words and their commentaries.778 The vacana's subject is whatever is related to the meaningful Dharma. Its function is that it can eliminate the afflictions of the three realms. Its means of expression is teaching the state of peace and nirvana. Its principal, primary condition is that it appears as the result ofbuddhahood. From the Sublime Co ntinuum: That which is meaningful and connected with the Dharma, that which teaches the elimination of the three realms' afflictions,"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"4l4 Mahamudrd and Related Instructions and that which teaches the benefits from peace, that teaching is the Rishi's, and that which is contrary is not.m VA CANA There are three kinds of vacana: that spoken from the Buddha's mouth, that spoken through his blessing, and that spoken through his authorization. Most of the vacana are words spoken from the Buddha's mouth. The blessed vacana are teachings by sravakas or bodhisattvas among his followers, or [words] that arose from a divine tree or great drum, and so on, through the power of a blessing from his body, speech, or mind. The authorized vacana are the pro­logues, introductions, supplements, and so on, [which are the words of] the compilers or the requesters of the teachings. There are the vacana of the H'inayana, the general Mahayana, and the Mantrayana. The first two are known as the sutras and the latter as the tantras. TREATISES The general, ordinary treatises are whatever was composed with the intent to write a treatise to teach a desired teaching. Therefore, fastras are all treatises from both Buddhist and non-Buddhist traditions and paths. There are two kinds [300] of treatises: the spurious and the genuine. In valid treatises are those that are meaningless, incorrect, negative distrac­tions, devoid of compassion, dedicated to learning, or dedicated to debate. Valid treatises are stated to be those that are meaningful, eliminate suffering, or are dedicated to practice. According to Vasubandhu: [They can be] meaningless, incorrect, or meaningful; deceitful, cruel, or able to eliminate suffering; devoted to study, to debate, or to practice; six of these are not [genuine] treatises and three are.7110 The genuine treatises are solely those that explain the meaning of the Bud­dha's words and have been written by an author with an undistracted mind, teaching in accordance with the path for the purpose of the attainment of liberation. From the Sublime Co ntinuum: That which is taught by minds free from distraction, that which concerns solely the teaching of the Conqueror,"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"Light Ra_ysfrom the }rwel of t he Exullent Teaching 425 that which is in accord with the path that attains liberation should be placed on the head, as if it were the Rishi's.�111 b. The Dharma of realization The Dharma of realization consists of the qualities of realization and elimi­nation within aryas and ordinary beings. It is stated to have two truths: the truth of cessation, which is freedom from desire, and the truth of the path, which brings liberation from desire. From the Sublime Co ntinuum: That which is, and through which there is, freedom from desire, that is the Dharma, which has the characteristics of the two truths. Freedom from desire is comprised of the truth of cessation and the truth of the path.m Therefore the entire Dharma can be summarized into these two: the Dharma of realization, which is the three trainings that are the three [taught] sub­jects: the superior training in mind, the superior training in conduct, and the superior training in wisdom; and the Dharma of scripture, which is the three scriptural baskets that are the three mediums [of teachings]: the Vinaya basket, the Sutra basket, and the Abhidharma basket. The three baskets can be categorized as two: the lesser basket, which was taught to those with dull faculties and lesser aspiration; and the vast basket, which was taught to those with sharp faculties and vast aspiration. From Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras: The scriptural baskets, whether three or two ... 783 Acarya Abhayakara taught that the Mantrayana is classified within all three baskets, but most say that it is classified as sutras. From [the Tantra Requested by ] Subahu: I shall teach the Mantrayana in the manner of the sutras.�8-� (301] From the Co mpendium ofTruths: I shall teach this surra well.m"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"426 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions Santipa has said: The purpose of the sutras is to teach summaries of the profound meaning.-86 When there is a classification of four scriptural baskets, the Mantrayana forms the separate category of the Vidyadhara basket. From [the Ta ntra Requested by ] Su bahu: The many kinds of mantras and vidyas are in order to benefit the devas and asuras. Therefore, in the Vidyadhara basket, the Conqueror taught 3.soo,ooo [mantras and vidyas].787 2. The presentation of the ta ntras This is in two parts: a. A presentation of the tantras in general b.

From the Adornment of the Vaj ra Mandala Ta ntra: If you know the categories of outer and inner, you will know the categories of the tantras.797 According to Abhayakara: Hold in your heart Vajradhara's lineages, which are like outer and inner vajras. The Teacher divided the rituals of mandalas and so on into two tantras.798 It is said that the lower three of the fo ur tantras are the outer tantras, while the highest is the inner tantra. Perfectly Illuminating Lamp says that the teaching of both generation and completion stages is the inner tantra and the teach­ings of the generation stage alone are the outer tantras. ii.

THE FOUR TANTRAS WERE TAUGHT IN ORDER TO TEACH INDIVIDUALS IN THE FOUR CASTES Action tantra was [taught] to those in the brahman caste, who delighted in cleanliness and purity and aspired to liberation through asceticism and hard­ship. Performance tantra was [taught J to those in the vaifya caste, who were unable to practice severe asceticism and hardship and would not engage in lowly activities. Yo ga tantra was [taught] to those in the k�atriya caste, who could not perform asceticism and enjoyed the pleasures of the senses. High­est yoga tantra was [taught] to those in the sudra caste, who made no distinc­tion between cleanliness and dirt, ate anything, performed lowly tasks, and had few conceptions. Alarpkakalasa teaches this in his commentary to the Expla natory Ta ntra of th e Vaj ra Ga rland. 803 Also, it has been taught that: Action corresponds to the purity of the brahmans; performance to the vaifyas, which is superior to that; yoga to the k�atriyas and their many retinues; and primordial liberation is fo r the fudras. 804 THE FOUR TANTRAS AS TAUGHT TO THE TIRTHIKAS Action tantra was taught to tirthikas who had ignorance: the fo llowers of Brahma who believed in liberation through washing, cleanliness, fasting, fire offerings, and so on. Performance tantra was taught to tirthikas who had anger: the fo llowers ofVi�t;lU who taught violence as Dharma.

This is said to be the teaching of such teachers as Acarya Nagarjuna. iii. The dijftrences among the four ta ntra s There are very many differences among the fo ur tantras, which can be sum� marized as fo llows. THE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE FOUR TANTRAS IN TERMS OF THEIR PRACTITIONERS Action tantra was taught to pupi ls who aspired to many external activities. Performance tantra was taught to pupils who were both interested in the true nature and attracted to many activities. Yoga tantra was taught to those who knew that many activities cause distraction and who were interested solely in meditation on the true nature. Highest yoga tantra was taught to those who were interested solely in nondual wisdom. This is the teaching given in Lamp of the Three �ys.806 THE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE FOUR TANTRAS IN TERMS OF THEIR RIPENING EMPOWERMENTS Action tantra has water and crown empowerments. Performance tantra has five empowerments: water, crown, vajra, bell, and name. Yoga tantra has, in addition to those empowerments, that of the irreversible master and its ancil� laries. Highest yoga tantra has the vase empowerment, which corresponds to all those empowerments and in addition, the secret, the prajfla's knowledge, and the fo urth empowerments. This is the teaching given in the Ti laka of Wi sdom.807 THE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE FOUR TANTRAS IN TERMS OF THEIR LIBERATING PATHS Action tantra has offerings and so on to a deity in front, and it teaches that samatha and vipasyana are accomplished through the deity's meditation and mantra repetition and through the three dhyanas.

Highest yoga tantra teaches the generation stage with its fo ur branches of the seva sadhana and so on, and teaches an aspect of the comple­tion stage with its practice of self-blessing and so on. iv. The etymology of the four tantras [305] Action (kriyd) tantra is so called because it primarily teaches external conduct such as washing and cleanliness. From Co mmentary to the Enlight­enment ofVairocana: Although the action tantras primarily teach external conduct ... 808 From Perfectly Illuminating Lamp: A tantra that describes washing, changing clothes three times, fasting, and so on is an action tantra.809 Performance (caryd) tantra is so called because there is an equal performance of both external activity ofbody and speech and the internal meditation of the mind.

The categories of the highest yoga tantra In highest yoga tantra, there are three categories: father tantras, mother tan­tras, and nondual tantras. The father tantras were primarily taught in order to train male pupils. The mother tantras were primarily taught in order to train female pupils. From the Vajra Tent:816 The yoga tantras were perfectly taught in order to train males. [ 3 o 6] The yogini tantras were taught in order to train women.

The mother tantras are said to be those that primarily teach profound wisdom. From Summary of the Entry into the Meaning of the Highest Yoga Tantras: Those tantras that primarily teach the true nature of vastness are the method tantras. Those tantras that primarily teach profundity are the wisdom tantras.817 Also, the father tantras are said to be those that primarily teach the nature of the generation stage, and the mother tantras are said to be those that primar­ily teach the nature of the completion stage. From Illumination of the Secret Nature: Because of the stages in which generation and completion occur, yoga is taught to be the generation, and completion is called the yogin'i.818 Therefore, by implication, the nondual tantras are those that teach both pro­fundity and vastness and teach the nature of both stages. DIFFERENCES AMONG THE GENERATION STAGES OF THE HIGHEST YOGA TANTRAS The father tantras teach the five tathagata family buddhas and their retinues to be primarily male. The mother tantras teach the tathagatas to be in the form of daki.Q.is, and thus the principal deities or their retinues are primar­ily fe male. In the father tantras all activities such as summoning the wisdom dei­ties are performed by male deities while the female deities remain motion­less. In the mother tantras goddesses perform those actions while the male deities remain motionless.

In the mother tantras there is the generation of the divine paL'lce upon the tier of the dements. In the non dual tantra, the tier of elements is first generated, dissolved, generated again and then the divine palace is generated upon it. In the fa ther tantras, the male and fe male deities have an equal number of arms and fa ces. In the mother tantras, the male and fe male deities have an unequal number of arms and fa ces. [307] In the nondual tantra, the principal male and fe male deities have an equal number of arms and fa ces but the reti­nue's male and fe male deities have an unequal number. In the fa ther tantras, most of the main and retinue deities are sitting. In the mother tantras, most of the deities are standing. In the nondual tantra, the principal deities are standing and the retinue is sitting. In the father tantras, the gurus822 are seated upon lions, precious thrones, and insignias ; they are primarily adorned with precious jewelry, and their insig­nias are wheels, jewels, and so on; the wrathful deities stand with the left [leg] stretched out and the peaceful deities are seated with the left [leg] majestically posed. They wear silk, and so on. In the mother tantras, the [deities] are seated on corpses, skulls, and so on. They are adorned in bone adornments, head garlands, and so on.

[The wrath­ful deities stand with] the right leg stretched out, and [the peaceful deities are seated with] the right leg majestically posed. They wear human skin, elephant skin, or are naked. In the fa ther tantras, the mandala has no char�el grounds. In the mother tantras, the mandala has charnel grounds. THE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE COMPL ETION STAGES OF THE HIGHEST YOGA TANTRAS The fa ther tantras primarily teach self-blessing, the stages of awakening, and so on. The mother tantras teach entering the true nature through union with the mahamudra, which is the method of the \"perfection of wisdom.\" From Illuminating Lamp:"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"436 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions There are no jewels in th is world other than the great self-blessing. It is natural, pure luminosity, like a jewel purified by fire.823 From the Vajra Tent: The method of the perfection of wisdom is here called yogini. There is entry into the true nature because of union with the mahamudra, and therefore it is called yogini tantra. 824 The mother tantras primarily teach the nature of the channels. The father tantras primarily teach the nature of the winds. From Commentary to the Oral Transmission: The <;iakini tantras are those tantras primarily concerned with the channels (ndt},is ), so one can recognize them by that. The tan­tras primarily concerned with yoga methods are primarily about the nature of the winds (vdyus), so one can recognize them by that.825 THE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE HIGHEST YOGA TANTRAS IN PURITY The father tantras teach that the pure five aggregates are the tathagatas. The mother tantras teach that the pure five elements are the five goddesses. From the Guhyasamdja Tantra: In brief, the five aggregates are the conquerors; they are all the tathagatas.1126 From the Hevajra Tantra: [;o8] Pukkasi is taught to be earth ... 112� It is said in the Rigi Arali Tantra:"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Light Ra_ys from the jewel of the Exullmt Teaching 437 Earth, water, fire, and air are here the fo ur goddesses.s!R The father tantras teach the pure winds to be the five wisdoms.

From the Gubyasamdja: These clear natures of the winds are the nature of the five wisdoms. 8�9 From the Cakrasarpvara Tantra: In these locations are the gakinis; they truly reside there because of the beautiful fo rm of the channels. 830 The differences explained here are not definite methods fo r categorizing something as a father or mother tantra.They are taught solely in order to indi­cate a tendency or predominant fe ature [of those tantras]. The three catego­ries of father tantra, mother tantra, and non dual tantra are simply categories made in the context of elaborated, provisional meaning. As fo r the definitive meaning, all highest yoga tantras are nondual tantras. Yoga and nondualboth refer to the inseparability of method and wisdom. This is taught concerning all highest yoga tantras. From the Primordial Buddha [ Kalacakra Tantra]: Yo ga does not exist because of the body of method; it doesn't exist because of wisdom alone. The Tathagata has taught that yoga is the perf ect union of wisdom and method.831 From the Latter Guhyasamdja Tantra: · Yo ga is taught to be the union of means and wisdom.

The causal tantra: the individual as a basis B. The method tantra: the stages of the path C. The result tantra: the result of practice A. The causal tantra: the individual as a basis This is in two parts: I. A teaching of the general outline of the causal tantra 2. An explanation of the specific categories of the causal tantra 1. A teaching of th e general outline of the causal tantra [309] To summarize the meaning of every tantra in general, there are three tantras: (1) The unique individual as a fo undation is the causal tantra. (2) That individual's practice of the stages of the path is the method tantra. (3) The temporary and ultimate results of that practice are the result tantra.

The outer aspect of the nature is the cause. The basis is said to be method and wisdom. Thus, there is the result that cannot be taken away. Those three summarize the meaning of tantra.8\\6 THE CAUSAL TANTRA: THE INDIVIDUAL AS A BASIS All beings in the six classes of existence have buddha nature, which is the cause ofbuddhahood. From a surra: Buddha nature completely pervades all beings.837 From a surra: Every one of these beings has the cause ofbuddhahood.s.\\s From the Hevajra Tantra: All beings are indeed buddhas but are obscured by extrinsic impurities.839 From the Sublime Continuum: Because the kaya of complete buddhahood is pervasive, because the true nature is indivisible, and because of\"the family;' all [beings] always have the essence ofbuddhahood.8\"0 That which is called the causal buddha nature is also called the true nature (dharmatd) and the truth (tattva)."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"440 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions THE WAY IN WHICH THIS [CAUSAL BUDDHA NATURE) RESIDES WITHIN INDIVIDUALS There is no good or bad in the natural purity of the essence [of beings], but there is purity and impurity in relation to the extrinsic stains of ignorance. Therefore, beings not on the path have an essence that is impure because of those stains; bodhisattvas on the path have an essence that is partially impure because of those stains and therefore somewhat pure; and tathagatas have an essence that is completely pure. From the Sublime Continuum: Impure, impure and pure, and completely pure describe, in that order, the element of a being, a bodhisattva, and a tathagata. 841 From Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras: The true nature is the same in everyone and yet is pure. Therefore, the nature of the sugatas is the essence of all beings. 842 In terms of families, the family of the buddhas is of two kinds: the primordi­ally naturally present family [3zo] and the truly accomplished and developed family. From the Sublime Continuum: Know the family to be of two kinds: the primordially naturally present and the supreme true acquisition. 843 \"Family;· \"element;' \"seed;' and \"cause\" all have the same meaning, and there­fo re the cause is that all beings have the \"family of buddhahood.\" However, there is a difference in terms of inferior and supreme causes in relation to their distance fr om buddhahood.

An explanation of the sp ecific categories of the causal ta ntra [311] The Characteristics Vehicle states that an individual as a basis [for lib­eration] is one of three types: the Hinayana family, the Mahayana family, and the uncertain family. In the Vajrayana [individuals] are categorized according to the five afflictions-extrinsic stains that hinder the cause of buddhahood, which is the true nature, the naturally present family. There are also [the categories of] the five wisdoms, which are the result of being purified of those [afflictions]: ( 1) the Vajra or Alqobhya family, ( 2) the Ta thagata or Vairocana family, ( 3) the Ratna or Ratnasambhava family, (4) the Padma or Amitabha family, (s) and the Karma or Amoghasiddhi family. The [Vajrayana] teaches that \"individ­uals who are bases\" belong to one of these five families and are categorized according to afflictions. If anger is strongest, they are in the A1qobhya fam­ily; if stupidity is strongest they are in the Vairocana family, and so on. From the Vtzj ra Te nt: In order to gather beings that have anger, stupidity, pride, desire, and miserliness, I become many forms in the circle of the vajra bearer.851 CATEGORIES ACCORDING TO COLOR Black is the Ak�obhya fa mily, white is the Vairocana family, and so on.

From Illu­minating Lamp: From the countless aspects of minds there are said to be five kinds of individuals: utpala (blue lotus), puQgarika (white lotus), padma (red lotus), candana (sandalwood), and ratna (jewel). The omniscient one taught their natures through these different names.854 Illuminating Lamp also teaches the differences among these individuals: Individuals are called utpala if they are skilled in remembering every [teaching] they have heard and can instantly repeat them. Individuals are called pu1J{idrika if they have heard many [teachings] that should be received but lack the ability to teach them. They are like bowls of cotton seeds."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"444 Mahtimudrti and Related Instructions Individuals are called padma if they have faith, compassion, and knowledge and on hearing [the teaching], it pours without difficulty, like milk, into their open minds.

Individuals are called ratna if they have pure conduct and are skilled and clever, have wisdom and single-mindedness, and after hearing [a teaching] are able to teach it excellently.m The first four of those five should primarily be introduced to the teaching and training of the gradual path. The fifth [kind of individual] is the supreme \"individual who is a basis.\" They should be introduced to practice from the beginning and can enter onto the instantaneous path, because their beings have already been trained.

The method tantra: the stages of the path This is in two parts: 1 . The general stages of the path 2. The stages of the Vajrayana path 1. The general stages of the path in the method tantra Individuals who are bases must first correctly depend upon a genuine spiri­tual friend (kalydr.zamitra) and listen to definite Dharma teachings. First, they must meditate upon how important and difficult is the acqui­sition of \"the freedoms and opportunities\" and must aspire to acquire their essence. The path of the lesser being is to meditate on impermanence and reject attachment to the experiences of this life. Then they should meditate upon the sufferings of the three lower existences, avoid their causes, which are bad actions, and practice good actions, which are the causes of happiness within existence. From Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment: It is taught that the least kind of beings are those who, through whatever methods, seek merely the happiness of samsara [313] fo r their own benefit.859 The path of middling beings is to meditate upon the sufferings of all six kinds of existences in samsara and to meditate on the causes and results of karma, thus rejecting attachment to the happiness of samsara.

Then they should follow the training of the pratimok�a. develop bodhicitta, and train in the practice of the bodhisattva's conduct, such as the six perfections, the ten perfections, and so on, thus proceeding through the five paths and the ten levels.

They iden­tify the crown empowerment as either making a [hand] mudra and placing that on the head or sealing with the family lord.m Some Indian texts appear to include some empowerments from the yoga tantras (as far up as the \"irre­versible\" empowerment) within the action tantra empowerments, [3IS] but the majority of reliable [sources] do not. The performance tantras teach, in addition to the liquid and crown empowerments, the va jra, bell, and name empowerments, so that they have five empowerments. From the Tilaka of Wisdom: The vajra, the bell, and similarly the name are perfectly and clearly described in performance tantra.8:'3 The Enlightenment of Vairocana describes the liquid empowerment only, but the Vajrapd1Ji Empowerment Tantra teaches [the others]. According to many [texts], both the action and performance empowerments should be preceded by the flower garland empowerment and have the concluding sup­ports of mantra, eye medicine, mirror, and teaching authorization [ empow­erments]. Some [texts] also teach authorizations for the wheel, spear, and so on, and entry into the special vajra-vrata conduct, the bestowal of prophecy, and reassurance. You might think that these concluding supports are inappropriate, be­cause there is no vajracarya empowerment in the action and performance tantras. However, even though there is no actual vajracarya empowerment of irr eversibility, they are not anomalies, because these concluding supports are empowerments solely for becoming acaryas of those particular action and performance tantras alone.

They rest in that kind of nature and then meditate with the consciousness of the mantra. Bind and rest in samadhi. Tightly bind with prdr;dydma (restraint of the life-breath).879 Enlightenment of Vairocana teaches that first you generate yourself as the deity, then you invite the deity to be in front of you, and so on. Then, in the mantra meditation, there are three [mantra] recitations and repetitions: fo cusing upon the fo rm of the letters in the heart of the deity in front of you; fo cusing upon the fo rm of the letters in your own heart; and fo cusing on the sound of the letters. (From the Latter Dhyana]: Focus on the sound, the mind, and the basis. The mantra dwells in the unchanging basis. Repeat the mantra with no aspect imperfect. If you become tired, relax within yourself. Changelessness is endowed with syllables. A basis comes from the basis, and in that way, when its own mantra is assigned externally, think of that as the purity of the mind.

This is followed by \"the first syllable;' which is meditation on bodhi­citta and emptiness. The \"second syllable\" is arising from that [meditation] as the sound of the mantra. The \"first fo undation\" is the perfect generation of yourself as the body of the Buddha. The \"second fo undation\" is generating the body of the Buddha in front of you. The external repetition is establishing the mantra circle upon a moon [disc) in the heart, binding with pra.t:layama, practicing mental repetition, and so on. From the Enlightenment oj'Vairocana: Syllable should be conjoined with syllable. Similarly. the basis becomes the basis. With tight fo cus, repeat the mantra a hundn:d thousand times in the mind.

Becoming one with the deity, and with a mind that fo cuses on not being different, create a state of inseparability. Do nothing other than that. 884 Thus, in the lower tantras there is meditation on deity yoga, praQ.a, samatha, and vipasyana, but the terms yoga with features and featu reless _yoga are used while the terms generation stage and completion stage are not used, fo r these latter two phases are the special path of highest yoga tantra. 3) 1he method for accomplishing siddhis in the action and performance ta ntras When you have become adept in seva, accomplish the siddhis.

The yoga with features is the overt yoga, which is fo cused upon the deity. Having received just the disciple (fik�ya) empowerment, you can medi­tate using the methods of the fo ur yo gas. From Commentary to the Firs t Part [of Compendium of Truths] : Thus, having taught one's own disciples yoga and subsequent yoga ... 893 The four yogas are described in Commentary on the Sri Paramddya Tantra: Yoga is generating yourself as having the nature of the deity, by meditating on five aspects of the true nature. Anuyoga (subse­quent yoga) is the superior aspiration of perfectly imagining the wisdom being (jnanasattva) entering you and becoming connate with it. Sarvayoga (total yoga) is the meditation on yourself as the essence of everything, both animate and inanimate. Atiyoga (extreme yoga) is the one-pointed mind in complete meditation on yoga, anuyoga, and sarvayoga.894 THE PROCEDURE FOR THIS RITUAL According to Commentary to the Firs t Part [of Compendium ofTruths], this is how you meditate in each of the four sessions: First, you ritually cleanse yourself. protect yourself and your location, gather the accumulations, and bind with seals. After those preliminaries, you meditate on selflessness, medi­tate on your deity, make the wisdom being enter, seal this with the four seals, [receive] the empowerment, make offerings, meditate on the great seal of your own deity, and repeat the mantra of your deity.119� Through receiving the icarya empowerment of the master, there is the meditation on the three samadhis: self: completion, and mahayoga.

Then you emanate the basis for accumulation and make homage to it, offer to it, and so on, and then you bind with the seals. After those preliminaries, you meditate upon yourself [as the deity], completion, and mahayoga, and meditate on the first yoga, the supreme victor of the mandala, and the supreme victor of activity. In the medium seva, you meditate on the meaning of the three mantras up until the mahayoga by emanating a mandala in the heart and arranging the individual essences [of the deities]. Once they enter the heart mandala, you meditate on the meaning of the three mantras while repeating them. In the briefs eva, you practice-as in the mahayoga-self and completion, repeating the mantra of each deity a hundred thousand times. In order to make the mind tractable in the overt yoga of fo cusing on the deity, meditate on the subtle yoga of fo cusing on the insignia.

The cultivation of stability according to Sakyamitra: The crazed elephant of the mind behaves badly.

Dhyana accomplishes all worldly siddhis, such as the discovery of treasures, and the supramundane siddhis, such as becoming a vidya-mantradhara.

First, you make the ritual dia­gram and then bless it by creating the wisdom diagram. The ritual diagram is the one made earlier, though many mahasiddhas have taught that it is made at this time. The wisdom diagram should be made with cords of the appro­priate substance, number, colors, lengths, blessing, arrangement, footsteps. circles, and so on. The rite of the colored [powders] must be carried out correctly in terms of the colored powder's substance, colors, blessing, method of application, and so on.

(2) Practicing, offe ring, and entering [into the mandala} Unless it is a body mandala, perform the mantra repetition while meditating that you become the deity and then dissolve. [ 3 31] Afterward, visualize the complete mandala in front of you. If it is a colored-powder [mandala], enter the mandala of the preparatory rite. In every kind of [mandala] the wisdom deities enter, offerings are made to them, they are praised, and so on. At the conclusion of the mantra repetition fo r the generation of [the dei­ties in the] vase, offer tormas to the mandala deities and to spirits (bhuta). Then, enter into the mandala, receive the empowerment, and make the prayers necessary fo r bringing your pupils into the mandala. In the case of a body mandala, meditate that your own body is the mandala in accordance with the sadhana and then practice the vase generation and so on. Then emanate a second identical mandala from your body mandala and enter into that body mandala. These two become inseparable fo r receiving the empowerment and fo r bestowing the empowerment on your pupils. Some say that when you are meditating on yourself as the body mandala, you omit meditating on an external mandala in front, entering into it, and giving empowerments to pupils from it, but that is nonsense. (3) Bringing pupils [into the mandala} and giving them the empowerment This is in two parts: (a) Bringing the pupils into the mandala (b) Bestowing the empowerment on those who have entered the mandala (a) Bringing the pupils into the mandala Generally speaking, the entry into the mandala is the preliminary part of the empowerments. First, the pupils are brought to the outside of the [manda­la's] curtain in order to make them worthy to enter the mandala.

Next, the pupils enter inside the curtain in order fo r their worthiness to be equal to the deities. The pupils, in order to have the same external worthiness as the deities, physically enter inside the curtain while mentally entering the divine palace through the eastern doorway. Then they develop an aspiration to the deities, circumambulate them, and make prostrations to them. In order to have the same inner worthiness as the deities, the pupils are instructed to keep the fo ur commitments, for they are the roots of all siddhis. Then the wisdom deities descend into them and become stable within them. In order to understand the omens concerning which siddhis will be accom­plished, their vision of the mandala is examined. The pupils are examined to see if they are ready or not to receive the mandala teachings and empower­ment. If they are ready, then they recite \"the power of truth\" and cast a flower [into the mandala], to see which deity's family they belong to. There is the empowerment of the flower garland, which establishes a strong interdependence for the pupils to be followers of their family deity. [332) They see the mandala, which makes them joyful, and develop strong diligence for accomplishing the Mantrayana siddhis. This is done by telling them to look with one side of their half-turned face, and then afterward the mandala is completely revealed to them and they meditate on joy.

This is the ultimate truth of the luminosity that is the essence of emp­tiness. However, this is not identifying plain emptiness without the objects of relative appearances, such as the illusion-like deities, or the bliss of their union. The wisdom of the fourth empowerment is Vajradhara, who is endowed with seven aspects. These seven aspects, according to VagiSvaraklrti, are: Sa '!lbhoga [kay a], union, great bliss, having no nature, being completely filled with compassion, being continuous, and being without cessation.996 There are these seven aspects: the aspect of complet e enjoyment, the aspect of union, the aspect of great bliss, and so on. Therefore, it is nonsense to say that the essence of the fo urth empowerment is the bliss of union sealed by empti­ness; or to say that it is simply a union of knowing and emptiness free from identifying the bliss of the four joys, and so on; or to state that it is merely the union of the clarity and emptiness of your own mind in a state in which you do not even visualize the mahamudra (great seal) of the deity's body.

The ninth is having doubts about phenomena, which are pure by nature. The tenth is to be always loving toward the malevolent. The eleventh is to have concepts concerning phenomena that are beyond words, and so on. The twelfth is to disturb the minds of those who have faith.

If you keep these commitments, you will have planted the roots of all siddhis. That is why they are called the root downfalls.

First, you must confess your transgression. According to Nagarjuna: The stages of serious root downfalls should be learned from the ritual.

From both the Fi t'e Stagrs and the Compendium of Practices: Birth is called relative truth and the name of death is ultimate knowledge. The attainment of those two stages, through the kindness of the guru, is future buddhahood. 10·'1 b) An expla nation of the names of the two stages (346] The name generation stage is used because the stages of seat, insignia, seed, and so on parallel the stages in the birth of beings. Yo u imagine the adornments of faces, arms, and so on-the apparent fo rms the deities have­and therefore their birth is \"imaginary.\" This is primarily the stage of medi­tating on the clear appearance of the deities, and therefore it is called the generation stage.

The colors, shapes, and so on of the generation stage dissolve into the anusvdra and finally the nada.1032 It is the stage where the elabora­tions of the three doors sequentially cease.

From Fi ve St,zges: The complete Buddha taught this method in the form of the steps of a stairway to those who dwelled perfectly in the generation stage and wished to [enter] the completion stages. w39 This means that first you meditate on the elaborate yo gas and purify ordinary thoughts. When you know the nature of thoughts, meditate on nonelaborate nonthought, through which there is liberation. From Vajragarb ha's commen­tary [to the Hevajra Ta ntra]: The conceptual rites are taught first, when you are in bondage to thoughts and propensities. When the nature of thoughts is known, there is total engagement in nonthought.10�0 Nagirjuna, his pupils, and many others have taught that you first accomplish a stable generation stage and then meditate on the completion stage. This means that those with dull faculties, who have no previous practice, have to make the first stage stable before training in the later stage, just like ascending a stairway. Mahasiddha Saroruha, Ajitacandra, and others have taught that you prac­tice the generation stage in the first part of the session and meditate on the completion stage in the latter part of the session. This refers to those who are somewhat adept and have medium faculties, in which case they can alternate training in the two stages, like [the feet when] walking. Some Tibetan lamas have taught that right from the beginning you meditate on both stages simul­taneously. This is taught for those with sharp faculties who have become perfectly adept, able to meditate on the union of the two stages, like a bird flapping both wings simultaneously. However, when a gradualist individual trains in the path of liberation they must train first in the generation stage and then the completion stage."},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"502 Atfahdmudrd and Related Instructions e) 1he stages of meditation in the two stages This is in three parts: i) At first there must be the \"imaginary\" generation stage. ii) When a special completion stage has been developed, the simple gen­eration stage becomes unnecessary. iii) The reason one must meditate on the union ofboth stages [348] i) At first there must be the \"i maginary\"generation stage. Vaj ragarbha asked the Bhagavan why one needs to practice the generation stage when it is the completion stage that contains the meaning of innate great bliss.

From Vajragarbha's commentary [to the Heva-Jra Tantra]: Seeing the three kinds of beings trapped in the net of thoughts, he taught particular types and numbers of methods that would bring them liberation. He taught the conceptual rites first to those bound by the propensity fo r thoughts.104·� Therefore, you first purify yourself of thoughts in the generation stage and then meditate on the completion stage. For example, in order to purify the land, you first plant buckwheat, 1044 and when the [ground] has been purified, then you plant salu rice.10•1s From Vajragarbha's commentary [to the Hevajra Tantra]: At first, you plant buckwheat in order to purify the field.

Until you have developed a special, stable realization of the natural, uncon­trived completion stage, you must depend on the contrived, imaginary gen­eration stage, so as to be able to develop [the completion stage]. However, when [the completion stage] has been developed, there is no need fo r delib­erate meditation on a contrived yoga such as a mere generation stage that is conceptual and imaginary.

From the He vajra Tantra: This is the yoga of the completion stage. Its bliss is known as great bliss. That bliss has no generation meditation. [So] what is to be gained by generation ?1054 In answer to that question, the Buddha taught that the generation stage is a base upon which the completion stage is based, like a flower and its scent. Moreover, a completion stage without the generation stage will be nothing other than a nonconceptual state without the perception of the appearance aspect of deities, and that cannot bring the attainment ofbuddhahood. From the Tantra ofUnion: Buddhahood does not come from nonthought, and it does not come from having thought.1055 Therefore, the generation stage is the method of practicing the body of union, while the completion stage is its wisdom.

At the entry of the gandharva [360] contemplate the fluid.1101 The intermediate goddesses make an invocation. The leader of the circle having been invoked, there are Moha1102 and the others at the eyes and so on. The vajras1103 are arranged in the three places.1104 It's taught that you generate the causal Vajradhara and consort. Their union emanates the retinue of deities who are arranged in their [appropriate] places. Then the letter or ndda that symbolizes the bardo [consciousness] enters the causal Vajradhara. That creates the condition fo r the deity and consort to melt into bliss and take the fo rm of a spherical drop (bindu). The goddesses in the intermediate directions make an invocation through song, causing the resultant Vajradhara to appear and so on."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"sn Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions The texts of some mahasiddhas teach that the syllable that symbolizes the bardo enters the causal Vajradhara and then the deity and consort melt into a sphere of bodhicitta that emanates the fo ur goddesses whose invocatory song generates the resultant Vaj radhara. That union of deity and consort then emanates their retinue arranged in their specific locations. Some [texts] teach that you practice in that way as far as the generation of the resultant Vaj radhara, but then the union of the male and female deities generates the residence and residents of the mandala in the lotus of the con­sort. This is progressively emanated outward; [the mandala deities] accom­plish their activities and are arranged in their individual locations. According to some in the Nagarjuna tradition of Guhyasamaja, during this \"supreme king [of the mandala]\" stage, the deity and consort's union causes them to gradually dissolve into luminosity. Then the invocatory song of the goddesses causes the \"body of unity\" to arise. In this context, the invo­catory song to the melted [deities] and the manner of their melting has a completely different symbolism and meaning, and therefore their key points are not the same. Mahasiddha texts teach a process of generation without an invocatory song: Yo u generate the causal Vaj radhara; the letter or ndda that symbolizes the bardo [consciousness] enters it so that it melts; then you generate the resul­tant Vaj radhara and the union of the deity and consort emanates the retinue [deities], arranged in their individual locations. Some teach that the causal Vaj radhara melts and transforms into moon and sun discs or that the causal Vaj radhara melts and merges into a separate moon and sun disc. In the center [of the sun and moon discs] is the insignia of the deity together with the seed syllable, and from them are generated the resultant Vaj radhara that then emanates the retinue. Some teach that there is no actual generation of the causal Vaj radhara deities but that the letter or ndda that symbolizes the bardo [consciousness] appears in the gap between the conjoined moon and sun discs and then from that is generated the causal Vaj radhara, which is the seed [syllable] of the deity. [361] That radiates and absorbs light rays, and then all blend and generate the resultant Vajradhara, which is the deities and their retinue and so on. There are many difFerent such descriptions, all approaches of individual tantra texts."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"Light Ra_ysfrom the}ert�rl of the Excellent Teaching Sl3 THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OFINVOCATORY SONGS It is taught that the melting accords with the buddhas doing nothing but resting in the kaya of great bliss (mahdsukhakdya) when there are no wor­thy pupils; the invocatory songs accord with demonstrating the fo rm kayas and benefiting beings until the time has come to teach pupils. The absence of the melting and the invocatory songs accords with the aspect of [the bud­dhas] always remaining to benefit beings and never dissolving [their bodies] fo r even an instant. THE GENERATION OF THE TWO VAJRADHARAS Both causal and resultant Vajradharas can be generated through the five awakenings or through any appropriate [process such as ] the three proce­dures. The causal and resultant Vajradharas have no single definitive fo rm, and therefore can have differing colors, [and numbers of] fa ces and arms. THE GENERATION OF THE RETINUE They can be generated in various ways, such as by the five awakenings or the three processes, or they can simply be generated from an essence or seed [syllable]. THE TIER OF THREE DEITIES This occurs in the majority of practices. The commitment being (samaya­sattva) is the deity that is generated in the practice; it has the same meaning as sdmayika.1105 1he wisdom being (jiidnasattva) is the deity that is visualized in the heart of the commitment being, where it is seated upon a lotus and sun, fo r instance. It can have different appearances. It may, fo r example, resemble the commitment being, or it may be a deity that differs in color [and number of] fa ces and arms, or it may be a seed syllable that transforms into an insig­nia. The samadhi being (samadhisattva) is a seed syllable or insignia that is meditated upon within the heart of the wisdom being� If the wisdom being is itself [being visualized as] an insignia, the samadhi being will be in the fo rm of a seed syllable that adorns it. In some practices only the principal deity of the mandala may have a tier of three deities. In others, all the deities [in the mandala] may have them. Most texts also teach the blessing of the sense bases and so on. While many [texts] teach that the deities are generated fr om just the seed syllables, some"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"S24 Afahdmudrd and Related Instructions teach that you meditate on an arrangement of the seed syllables alone with­out meditating on the deities themselves. [362] (iii) 1he completing ancillaries According to the Vajra Tent: The wisdom truly enters. The empowerment is tasting the nectar of the eight vidyas. The eight goddesses make offerings. The leader of the circle is praised. 1106 Thus it is taught that you should practice the entry of the wisdom deities, the empowerment, the offerings, and the praises. THE ENTRY OF THE WISDOM BEING Light rays from the seed syllable in the heart invite the wisdom mandala's residence and residents, who are identical to your meditation, to come from their natural abodes. The offerings and so on are made. The wisdom-being [mandala] enters the commitment-being mandala.1107 Imagine with convic­tion that they have merged to become one. Some texts teach that the invitation is made through the sound pherp, or through the sound of the joy of sexual union, and so on. Some texts teach that only the wisdom deities and not their divine palaces are invited. There are many other versions, such as inviting the buddhas and bodhisattvas in the ten directions without their having any definite resemblance to the com­mitment deities. THE PURPOSE FOR THE ENTRY OF WISDOM DEITIES According to the instructions in Ears ofGrain,1108 [the entry of wisdom dei­ties is practiced] in order to truly think that all tathagatas have a single iden­tity, so that you will have conviction in equality. Atisa taught that [the en try of wisdom deities is practiced] in order to end thoughts of separation between yourself and the wisdom deities, in order to have the enduring pride of inseparability [from the deities], and in order to receive blessing. 110� · Some teach that the commitment being is inferior and the wisdom bein g"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"Light Rtz.vs.from the }rtnl of thr Exullrnt Traching SlS is superior, and that therefore if you don't make the wisdom being enter, the commitment being will be a mindless image unable to bestow siddhis, but this is nonsense. THE EMPOWERMENT This is the meditation where light fr om the seed syllable in the heart invites the empowerment deities, and because of offerings and supplication, they give empowerment. In the Hevajra Ta ntra, there is an extensive teaching on this, fo r example: [The deity's] own seed, [imagined] in [his] own heart, radiates a ray. Its black light in the fo rm of a hook draws in all the bud­dhas in the three realms and the eight matrikas make offerings to them.1110 THE EMPOWERMENT DEITIES In most texts the empowerment deities are identical to [the deities in] the meditated mandala during the empowerment. THE EMPOWERMENT The majority of texts teach only the \"liquid empowerment.\" Saroruha and Atisa [both] teach fo ur empowerments. (363] There are gurus who have taught that the vase empowerment alone will suffice fo r meditation on the generation stage but that all fo ur empowerments are necessary [for medi­tation] related to the completion stage. However, this is not something definitive. THE PURPOSE OF THE EMPOWERMENT [The empowerment is given] in order to wash away the stains of fa ults and to enable you to accomplish the goal. From the Hevajra Ta ntra: It is poured upon (sicyate) [you] and bathes (sndpyate) [you] ; That is why it is called an empowerment (seka, a \"pouring\").1111 Atisa taught eight purposes of an empowerment:111!

THE APPLICATION OF THE SEALS There are many different versions, among which the He vajra Ta ntra teaches one in detail:1113 + Nature sealed by nature: For example, Ak�obhya, who is the nature of the mind, is applied as a seal to the nature of consciousness, which is [Ak�obhya,] the deity that is the purity of anger. + The body sealed by the mind: Ak�obhya, [the deity of] the purity of the mind, seals those of the family ofVairocana, the deity of the purity of the body. + The mind sealed by the body: The seal ofVairocana, [the deity of] the purity of the body, is applied as a seal to those of the family of Ak�obhya, the deity of the purity of the mind. + The result sealed by the cause: Amitabha, [who is the deity of] the purity of desire, which is the cause, seals those who are of the family of Amoghasiddhi, the deity of the purity of envy, which is the result. + The cause sealed by the result: Ratnasamb hava, the deity of the purity of miserliness, which is the result, seals those of the family of Amitabha, the deity of the purity of desire, which is the cause. There are also teachings on a system of mutual sealing between the families and those who belong to the families, between [the deities] who are gen­erated and those who generate them, and between cause and result. From Vaj ragarbha's [Hevajra] commentary: The children are sealed according to their family and the children seal the families. The father seals the son and the son seals the father. The result seals the cause and the cause seals the result.111'' Thus, there are many kinds [of seals]. but most texts teach the seals of the family and the family member, which is easier to understand."},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"Light Ra:vs from thr ]rwrl of thr Excrllrnt Traching Sl7 THE PURPOSE OF SEALING [The seal is applied] because you need to meditate without error on the fa mi­lies in order to accomplish the general and special siddhis.

There will be no siddhis and no siddhas from meditation practice on a misidentified fa mily.111s TASTING THE NECTAR AND MAKING OFFERINGS AND PRAISES Different texts teach different methods, but all teach that these are to be done while knowing that the offerer, the offering, and the recipient are birth­less emptiness. THE PURPOSE OF TASTING THE NECTAR AND MAKING OFFERINGS AND PRAISES It is taught that these practices are done so that you will know that your entire field of experience, such as the substances of sensory delight, are a display of immaculate bliss and emptiness.

This principally refers to a human being who pos­sesses the six elements.1116 Death means the dissolution of such aspects as the twenty-five evident aspects: the five aggregates, the fo ur elements, the six faculties, the five sen­sory objects, and the five wisdoms. There are many signs of their dissolution, but we can simplify the stages of dying into the evident dissolution of the four elements: + When the earth element of the body merges into water, this causes: (a) the external sign of the body being unable to move and an inability to hold anything; (b) the interna l sign of a perception of something like smoke. + When the water element merges into fire, this causes: (a) the external sign of the body sweating and the sali va in one's mouth drying up; (b) the internal sign of a perception of something like a mirage; and (c) the cessation of the thirty-three kinds of thoughts that arise from aversion. + When the fire element merges into air, this causes: (a) the external sign of the warmth of the body leaving its extremities; (b) the internal sign of a perception of something like fireflies; and (c) the cessation of the fo rty kinds of thoughts that arise from attachment. + When the air element merges into consciousness, this causes: (a) the external sign of the exhalations lengthening and the inhalations becoming imperceptible; (b) the internal sign of a perception of some­thing like lamp flames fluttering in the wind; and (c) the cessation of the seven kinds of thoughts that rise from ignorance. The subtle process of dissolution consists of the three visions: When con­sciousness merges into appearance, this causes a bright white appearance that is like a cloudless sky filled with moonlight. When appea rance merges into incre,zse, this causes a red appearance that is like a cloudless sky filled with sunlight. When incretzse merges into ,ztt,zinn�ent, [ 3 6 s] this causes a black appearance that is like a cloudless sky filled with an all-pervading darkness. Then your mindfulness diminishes until you become completely uncon­scious. When you recover consciousness, there is the experience of lu. minos­i�y. This is like the clear sky at dawn, free from the factors that stain space: moonlight, sunlight, and darkness. 1 w"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"Light R,�yJ.from thr}ttNI of tht El.:allmt Ttaching s2.9 B' The way the bardo mantfosts Attainment arises fr om the luminosi�y; mo·eaJe arises fr om ,zttainment; appearance arises fr om incre,zse, each lasting fo r only an instant. The eighty kinds of thought arise fr om appe,zrance, after which the bardo body, which is a wind-mounted consciousness, is created. At first, there are the momentary appearances fr om the propensities of your past life. They become less and less clear until the appearance of the body of your next life arises. This is explained in the great commentary to the Kalacakra: The [bardo] body takes on the fo rm it will have on being reborn; it has all sensory fa culties; it can pass through anything except its fu ture birthplace; it is endowed with miraculous physical powers; the body increases through eating smells; it can be seen by other bardo beings of the same class and [by living beings] with divine sight; it moves around in search of smells and its birthplace; it has all ki nds of perceptions because of good or bad karma; it has very little stability ; the length of its lifetime can be up to seven days but this is not definite, fo r if it is not re born, it experiences a \"little death;' which is like fa inting briefly, and then comes back into the bardo fo r another \"lifetime\" of seven days. If it does not encounter the accumulation of fa ctors necessary fo r rebirth, this process can repeat until fo rty-nine days have passed, and then it will definitely be reborn. There is no bardo if you are be reborn in the fo rmless realm; instead a \"formless aggregation\" is created at the very spot where you died. Otherwise, before rebirth in the desire or the fo rm realms, a bardo definitely occurs. C' The way birth takes place When you are reborn, there can be fo ur kinds of births. If it is going to be a sp ontaneous rebirth, you will have a craving fo r a certain location, and your attachment and aversion cause a \"little death,\" which is like a brief fa int, fr om which you take rebirth. If it is going to be birth through warm moisture, your attachment and aversion toward smell and taste will cause you to briefly [366] fa int, fo llowed by rebirth. If it is going to be birth fr om a womb or an egg, your attachment and aversion on seeing your [future] parents having sex will cause you to briefly fa int, fo llowed by rebirth. The moving winds, which are the nature of the bardo existence, dissolve. A subtle fo rm of [the succession of] ap pearance, increase, attainment, and luminosity will occur. Rebirth takes place when attainment reappears from"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"luminosity. 1hen increase arises from attainment; appearance arises from increase; and thoughts arise from appearance. The special air dement that has the power to create a ba�is fo r conscious­ness arises from the air that \"rides\" upon appearance. From that air elemtnt arises the fire element. Similarly, from the fire element arises the water ele­ment, and from the water element arises the earth element. From those cle­ments, the aggregates and so on are generated. The Salflvarodaya Tantra in particular teaches the proc ess ofbirth from a womb:1118 When in the bardo you see your [future] parents lying with each other, you enter your father through his mouth or through the crown of his head and then exit from his genitals to enter your mother's vagina, where conception takes place in the middle of the semen and blood. Then you develop in the womb. The semen and blood contain the four elements: earth creates its solid­ity, water creates its cohesion, fire creates its ripening, and air creates its increase. There is a gradual development through the vitality of the mother's air, blood, and so on. In the first week, [the embryo] is in the fo rm of a kalala.1119 In the second week it is in the form of an arbuda.1120 In the third week it is in the fo rm of apefi.1121 In the fourth week it is in the form of aghana.11221hen it solidifies, and in the fifth month, while having a form like a fish, it develops limbs. In the seventh month, hair, nails, and so on, develop. In the eighth month, the sensory faculties of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind develop. In the ninth month, the body is completely developed, and in the tenth month it is born from the womb. (ii) The purification [through the generation stage} There are specific [purifications] in relation to particular qualities of [an individual who is] an impure basis, but fo r now, in order to make it easy to understand, [purification] will be explained in a general manner. The impure basis is someone who, having accumulated karma for rebirth from a womb, dies, becomes a bardo being, enters a womb in the world of humans, is born from the womb when the body is fully developed, and then accomplishes a variety of actions in that lifetime. The purification consists of the gathering of the accumulations; the medi­tation on emptiness; the divine palace (within which there is the causal Vajra­dhara); the ndda or syllable that enters [the causal Vajradhara]; [367] [the"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"Light R��'YJfrom thrjewel of thr E.wrllent Teaching S3I causal Vaj radhara] melting: the invocation through song: the arising as the resultant Vajradhara: and so on. THE WAY IN WHICH THESE CORRESPOND WITH EACH OTHER Gathering the accumulations through the field of accumulation corresponds with the accumulation of karma that is the cause fo r rebirth. The meditation on emptiness corresponds with the stages of death. The tier of elements, the divine palace, and the seats [of the deities] corre­spond with the environment of the world and the location where the rebirth takes place. The deity and consort who are the causal Vajradhara corresponds with the mother and fa ther. The nada or syllable entering [the causal Vajradhara] corresponds with the bardo beings seeing their parents having sex and then entering the fa ther's mouth or head and so on until conception in the womb. The melting of the deity and consort corresponds with the parents losing consciousness fr om orgasm. The invocatory song by the goddesses causing the resultant Vaj radhara to arise corresponds with the bardo being entering the semen and blood and then passing through the stages of kala/a, arbuda, and so on, and being made firm by the earth element, cohesive by water, ripe by fire, and increased by air, until there is the complete development of the body. If there is no melting and invocatory song and there is entry of the nada or syllable, then that corresponds to the [entry of] the bardo being, but if there is no [entry of the nada or syllable], then the seed syllable corresponds to the bardo being while the moon and sun correspond to the fa ther's white element and the mother's red element. The generation of the deity through the stages of the seed syllable trans­fo rming into the insignia and so on corresponds to the body becoming com­pletely developed through such stages as the fo rm of a fish developing limbs. The commitment being corresponds to the temporary body, which is the individual's elements and the evidently created body. The wisdom being cor­responds to the energy of the body's winds, channels, and bodhicitta. The samadhi being corresponds to the natural, subtle body composed of only mind and wind. Blessing the sense bases corresponds to the complete development of such [internal] sense bases as the eyes and so on awakening and cognizing the six [external] sense bases such as fo rm. Blessing the body corresponds to the"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"532 Mahamudra and Related Instructions complete development of the different parts of the individual's body. Bless­ing the speech corresponds to the complete development of the eight loca­tions of speech and so on. Blessing the mind corresponds to the complete development of the mind directing its mindfulness toward objects. If there is the emanation of deities as in the \"supreme king of the mandala, [stage of the practice), that corresponds to the birth of a male or fe male indi­vidual. [368) The majority of texts do not clearly teach the correspondence between the completing practices and the impure basis, but the entry of the gurus or wis­dom deities corresponds to the engaging consciousnesses waking from the alaya, drawing in externals, and returning to the dlaya. Receiving empowerment corresponds to washing stains from the baby and so on. Sealing corresponds to attaining a status within the family. Offering corresponds to the sensory faculties becoming extremely attached to objects so that craving increases and taste is experienced. Praising corresponds to obtaining all worldly qualities so that others will praise [the individual] fo r being wise, clear, and so on.

This is a sequential meditation of all the practices as presented in the sadhanas. According to Dipa�pkara[bhadra] : The beginner rises in the morning and repeats [mantras] excellently, as before.1123 From Ears of Grain: In this way alone, the beginner performs all the practices, leaving nothing out. 1124 THOSE WHO HAVE HAD SOME WISDOM DESCEND (UPON THEM) In this stage, having been able to visualize the evident deities fo r brief periods of time, you meditate on the subtle aspects in sequence. This means that after a brief meditation on the evident mandala, you meditate on the sequence of subtleties, such as blessing the sense bases.

THE WAY (YOU GAIN STABLE PRIDE] Texts by mahasiddhas teach that afi:er mastering the generation practices, you meditate on the mandala, and when you become tired, you practice mindful­ness of purity, repetition [of the mantras], and so on. In that way, you medi­tate sequentially on the practices as described in the sadhanas. You meditate by clearly visualizing whatever deity it is as clearly as you can and develop stable pride in each practice by thinking \"I am this [deity].\" In this stage you maintain the visualization of the entire mandala with mindfulness and awareness. If other appearances arise, you don't become involved with them but continue to meditate on the visualization, progres­sively lengthening the duration of the visualization. (370] Maintaining the fo cus through mindfulness and awareness is like taming an elephant. Accord­ing to Sakyamitra: The crazed elephant of the mind behaves badly. Tie it to the post of the fo cus by using the rope of mindfulness, and then gradually bring it under control with the hook of wisdom.1132 The gurus have taught that if you are unable to visualize the entire mandala, then first visualize a part of the body of the principal deity, such as his main fa ce, and then gradually attain a \"clear appearance.\" Alternatively, look again and again at a painting or statue of the yidam deity so that it will appear clearly in your mind, just as when people imagine over and over someone they desire until they appear clearly as if truly present. According to Dharmakirti: When dreaming about thieves, fo r instance, or when overpowered by desire, fe ar, or misery, you see something that has no reality as being present in fr ont of you. 1133"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"� �(, .\\f,,h,·imudr.i .md Rr/,ard lmtru(/iom If you meditate first on something in front of you in that way, it will be eas­ier to meditate on yourself as being the same as that.

When you have become very familiar with (an image], it will appear clearly in that way. According to Dharmakirti: Therefore, whatever you become very familiar with, whether it be true or false, when that familiarization is complete, it will become nonconceptually dear in the mind.''34 Yo u should also know that throughout every stage of training in the gen­eration stage, the entire appearance of the mandala and all that appears to the mind is just relative appearance with essentially no reality; they are ulti­mately empty. Yo u must train in [seeing] everything that arises as illusions. From the Vaj ra Tent: Just as the moon on the water is neither true nor false, in the same way, the bodies in the mandala circle have an unblemished nature.113s 3' The teaching on the complete mastery of the generation stage This training in the generation stage enables you to visualize distincdy the shapes, colors, faces, arms, adornments, and so on of the entire, obvious [man­dala] residence and residents, and also all the colors, faces, arms, and so on of the subde dy atana deities and the rest. From Commentary to the Black Yamdntaka: Because of that, you can freely see the vajra bodies and the rest as if they were a fruit in the palm of your hand.

There is form repetition, which is being mindful of the deity yoga alone. There is yoga repetition, which is contem­plating the true nature alone.IIS2 Ears of Grain also teaches fo ur ways of practicing the mantra repetition. THE SAMAYA REPETITION As the breath rises from the seed syllable in the heart, the deities of the man­dala are emanated [from the seed syllable] and accomplish the benefit of beings. As the breath enters [the seed syllable, the deities] reenter the seed syllable. When you first recite the mantra of a particular deity, the deities are emanated; when you conclude reciting [the mantra, the deities] are absorbed. This is also taught to be the radiation-absorption mantra repetition. Concern­ing this, according to Diparpkara: The wisdom bodies are emanated and you repeat. As you recite, the praJ)a causes emanation. The mantra fo rcefully absorbs.1153 THE PALANQUIN MANTRA REPETITION Imagine that all phenomena are equal. Meditate that a line of mantras enters your mouth and, passing through your vajra, enters the lotus of the consort; passing through her central channel, it exits from her mouth and enters your mouth, and [continues to] circle in this way. This is also taught to be the lit­ter mantra repetition.

From the Guhya­samaja: When you can hear the syllables of the mantra, that is taught to be the wrathful repetition.1155 Some teach that samaya repetition is repeating the essence and quintessence mantras; palanquin repetition is the gentle mantra circle; fierce repetition is the harsh mantra circle ; and wrathfu l repetition is the repetition of all man­tras. However, most mahasiddha texts teach that any of the first three levels of mantra repetition can be used fo r the repetition of all mantras. Some texts teach fo ur repetitions that consist of the first two fr om above with the addition of circular repetition and vajra repetit ion. Circular repetition is when the mind arranges the mantra, with the let­ters standing up in a circle, like a circle of lamps, around the seed syllable in the heart, and as you repeat it, it is as if you are writing the letters with your mind. Vajra repetition is where the repetition conjoins with the inhalation, exha­lation, and retention of the breath. The gurus have taught that there are five kinds [ofvajra repetition]: (1) mental repetition, which is repeating [the man­tra] in the mind without re citing the mantra's words; (2.) cessation repetition, which is a mental repetition [of the mantra] while the breath is stopped; (3) Vaj ra repetition, which is repetition [of the mantra] conjoined with inhala­tion and exhalation; (4) whisper repetition, which is repeating [the mantra] with merely the movement of the lips and tongue; and (s) the repetition that resembles reciting the Vedas, which is repeating [the mantra] with syllables that are half their length and in a very secret voice.

Vajragarbha's commentary (to the Hevajra Ta ntra] teaches that the sequence of mantra repetitions is seed[-syllable mantra], quintessence [man­tra] , essence (mantra], and root mantra. For it states : The seed, the quintessence, the essence, and the root mantras are taught to be the repetition and meditation of wisdom, mind, speech, and body, in that order.1159 Some say that as the body is the most evident, it is easier to invoke, while the speech and mind are increasingly subtle, so that you must begin by repeating the root mantra and then proceed co the essence and chen the quintessence mantras, but chis is nonsense."},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"S44 Alahdmudrd and Related Instructions The colors and so on of the mantras are taught in relation to categories of activity, but in the beginning, during seva practice, there is no need to change the color of the deity and mantra.

There are also the six yo gas of Cakrasarpvara in the lineage of Acarya Anupamarak�ita.1193 From Ocean ojl)akas: Their own bodies are the same as an illusion. This self-blessing is subtle. The vajra repetition has its own characteristics. There is \"enlightenment;' the treasure of the mind. Beyond that, there is union. 1194 Thus, in this teaching of five stages, the five are self-blessing, vajra repetition, \"enlightenment\" (abhisambodhi), fo cusing on the mind, and union. [381] Mahasiddha Liiyipa summarizes these into three: (x) meditating on the dei­ty's body being like a rainbow is the process of self-blessing; (2) dissolving [the deity's body] through the meditation of subsequent dissolution is the process of true enlightenment (abhisambodhi); and (3) arising as the lumi­nous body is the process of union. Ghal)�a taught the fo llowing five levels: the self-blessing stage, the vajra­cross stage, the jewel-filled stage, the Jalandhara stage, and the inconceivable stage. The first fo ur stages make the channels, winds, drops. and mind trac­table. The last stage causes luminosity and arising in union. Kambala and K.r�Qapa's teaching on the completion stage is in agreement with this. The He vajra Tantra describes the Hevajra completion stage : The caQ<;lali blazes in the navel. 119s This teaches caQ<;lali yoga or drop yoga. Many siddhas teach only the CaQQali.

Mahasiddha Saroruha teaches the deity's body as the self-blessing of the channel-wind yoga, the subsequent dissolution [of the deity's body] as the process of entering luminosity, and the process of arising from that [ luminos­ity] as the body of union.1197 Thus, it is taught in all mother tantra completion stages that the illusion­like world and inhabitants enter and arise from luminosity and accomplish unton. ii) A summary of the key points of the completion stage The descriptions of the completion stage given in various tantras are for the purpose of accomplishing the \"training union;' which causes the accomplish­ment of the goal: the \"non training union;' which is the wisdom body. The training union is accomplished through the process of the illusion­like deity's body entering into and arising from luminosity. This entry into and arising from [luminosity] must have the completion stages ofboth rela­tive self-blessing and ultimate luminosity. [382] Those two completion stages are necessary for the accomplishment because they make the channels, winds, and drops tractable. There are slightly differing ways of practicing these [completion stages ]. The father tantras rely first upon the three \"solitudes\" in order to accomplish the union through the stages of illusory body and luminosity. The mother tantras rely first upon the yoga of channels, winds, and drops in or der to accomplish union through the stages of connate bliss and emptiness. Subdividing these categories results· in many different ways of practice, so there is no one definitive form. Nevertheless, all the essential points of the completion stage are contained within these three: the relative completion stage of self-blessing, the ultimate completion stage of mahamudra lumi­nosity, and the completion stage of the inseparable union of the two truths."},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"Light Ra.y.rftom the }ewtl of thr Excellent Teaching sss Therefore, I will teach here a definitive general description of the completion stages in the tantras. iii) The stages of meditation in the completion stage This is in three parts: (A) The completion stage of self-blessing (B) The completion stage of the luminosity of mahamudra (C) The completion stage of inseparable union (A) The completion st age of self-blessing This is in two parts: (I) The yoga of channels, winds, and drops (2) The description of the illusory body ( 1) The yoga of channels, winds, and drops This is in two parts: (a) The common yoga (b) The cal)<;iali yoga (a) The commonyoga In general, at the beginning of all completion stages, you need to make the channels, winds, and drops tractable.

They are further subdivided into 3·S million. From the Vaj ra Garland Ta ntra: I shall explain the nature of the permanent Bow of the channels: Twenty-four thousand are known as the descent of the bodhicitta. They perfectly increase all bliss. These are constantly marvelous channels. Twenty-four thousand are known as the descent of the blood. They have the nature of the shining sun. These are constantly marvelous channels. Twenty-four thousand are known as the movement of the winds. 1199 From Vaj ragarbha's commentary [to the Hevajra Ta ntra]: They are seventy-two thousand [in number].

From the Vaj ra Garland Ta ntra: From the flow of the doorway of the nose, the movement of life (prd1Ja) and control (dydma) is constantly in movement, and this is taught to be pral)a.1209 From Five Stages: That which is the life of all beings and which is called wind performs all activity.

In particular, they are taught to be the descent of bodhicitta through thirty-two channels. From the Vaj ra Garland Ta ntra: Twenty-four times a thousand: know these to be the descent of the bodhicitta. 1216 From the Hevajra Ta ntra: [385] There are thirty-two channels. They are the thirty-two that con­vey bodhicitta.1217 As to which element descends through which channel, the Tantra of True Un ion says:"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"Abhedya is in Pullira and is said to \"descend into the teeth and nails.\" Siik�marupini. which is in Jalandhara, similarly descends to the head hair and body hair.12111 The text continues in that way. THE CHANNELS OF THOSE DROPS The power of the white element is present in the form of harrz at the crown of the head inside the central channel. The power of the red element is present in the form of a \"short a\" at the navel. From the Ta ntra of True Union: [The lotus that is present in the heart has four petals and a center.] The channels, which are present within them, have the nature of a lamp flame. They extend downward, like the flower of a plantain tree. The qak.a that is present within has the width of a mustard seed. The seed that is the indestructible hurrz drips like [melting] snow. This heart joy ofbeings is taught to be \"Spring.\" Nairatmya, who has the form ofVaqabagni, 1219 is called \"the drop.\" The karmic winds' exhortation causes it to blaze in the navel's mandala. 1220 This meditation on the yoga of channels, winds, and drops makes the chan­nels, winds, and drops tractable. One will th en be able to perfectly dissolve the winds in the central channel and cause the bliss of melting. This definitely requires the ability to make the winds enter the central channel and activate a genuine bliss and heat. Each of the four cakras have entrances for the wind to enter the central channel, but here I will explain how the wind enters the central channel as the result of mastering the a-stroke and the navel cakra. When the wind correctly enters [the central channel), you pass through the following stages: The sign of earth dissolving appears, which is like clouds or a mirage. The sign of water dissolving appears, which is like smoke. The sign of fire dissolving appears, which is like fireflies. The sign of air dissolv­ing appears, which is like lamp flames.

While the yogins are awake, they manifest the fo ur empties of the winds dissolving into the central channel. As a result, when they go to sleep the wind dissolves [into the central channel]. This causes the definite sequence of space filled with moonlight, which is appearance, space filled with sunlight, which is increase, and space filled with complete darkness, which is attainment. When that concludes, there arises luminosity, which is like a sky free of the three polluting factors. Recognize it and rest in equanimity. It is taught that those who are unable to attain this through the power of wind ( vayu) may be able to do so through the power of aspiration, but then it will be difficult [for them] to definitively master the sequence of the four empties. If you can adopt deep sleep without appearances as the path, there will be the special luminosity of sleep. When that state of no appearances ceases, and there are both obvious and subtle appearances, that is called the attenuated luminosity, which is merely the simple luminosity of sleep and not the actual luminosity of the four empties. According to Naropa: At the border between sleep and dreams are two strong factors contrary to dreaming: dullness that has the nature of the dharmakaya and the experience of unelaborated, empty luminosity. Subsequently, whatever appears arises as bliss. That natural, uncontrived nature is given the name the teaching oj'luminosi�y.124\" From Instructions through Similes: The aggregates and so on enter the subtle element.

THE ACTUAL INSTR UCTIONS FOR DREAMS The arising of the various appearances of dreams are adopted as the path. When yogins begin to arise from the luminosity of sleep into dreams, they instantaneously arise as the illusory body, as previously explained. If they are unable to do that, they should become aware that dreams are dreams, train in seeing the appearances of dreams as illusions, train in mastering dreams, [392.] become habituated to the path of fa miliarization, and develop a pure realm to which they will ascend. From the Fi rst and Second Instructions through Similes: There are five aspects to dreams.

The main part of the dream practice is to become fa m iliarized with that illusory body.

Basis luminosity is the luminosity of the true nature, the luminosity of sle.ep, and the luminosity of death. These definitely arise to everyone, whether they meditate on the path or not and whether they recognize them or not. Path luminosity is comprised of: + General luminosity: This is the view that realizes phenomena as birth­less emptiness. + Secret luminosity: This is the luminosity of the \"fourth empty\" result­ing from the dissolving of the winds into the central channel, or it is the luminosity that is recognized within the experience of the innate [joy] fr om among the fo ur joys. In the latter, there is: + Analogous luminosity: The innate [joy] or \"fourth empty\" that [still] has the duality of subject and object. + The true luminosity : The innate [joy] or \"fourth empty\" that has no duality of subject and object. + The ultimate luminosity: The manifestation of the nonconceptual wis­dom that realizes the true nature; this wisdom is like a stainless sky and is without even the subtlest duality. + Result luminosity: The luminosity of the \"non training union.\" Secret luminosity is the luminosity that you have to accomplish but must be preceded by general luminosity.

It is absolutely necessary to have the experience of the winds entering the central channel, remaining in [the central channel], and dissolving into the central channel. Nothing else other than that can bring out the true, secret luminosity. There are many methods fo r meditation on luminosity, but all mahasiddha texts teach the method of entering luminosity by dissolving the world and its inhabitants through either of two meditations. [397 J These are described in Fi ve Stages: The pupil who has received the instructions trains in two yogas: The stage of total eclipse and the stage of subsequent dissolution.1277 Thus there are the two dhyanas: total eclipse and subsequent dissolution. Total eclipse: Meditate that you are the illusion-like body of the deity as a tier of the three deities.

They are"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"s8o .Afahdmudrd and Related Instructions transformed into light and dissolve into you. Then you [dissolve] as in the total eclipse. In both [total eclipse and subsequent dissolution] the dissolving into luminosity is the same as when your breath on a mirror gradually disappears from the outer edges inward. From Five Stages: The total eclipse is taught to be [the dissolving of everything] from the head to the fe et until [the dissolving] reaches the heart and the yogin enters the final limit. In the stage of subsequent dissolution, first all the animate and inanimate are transformed into luminosity, and subsequently you do the same with yourself. Just as the steam from your breath completely dissolves upon a mirror, in that way the yogin repeatedly enters into the true limit.1278 Repeating these two dhyanas is the extremely profound key point for dissolv­ing the winds and bodhicitta into the heart so that the signs of the sequential dissolution of earth, water, fire, air, and consciousness will manifest. From the Latter Guhyasamdja Tantra : The mind is transformed into the vajra of cessation and then there is the possession of si gns. The vajra of enlightenment has taught that there are five aspects to the nature of the signs. The first is like a mirage. The second is like smoke. The third is like space. The tourth shines like lamp flames. The fifth is a continuous radiance, which is like a cloudless sky. •!���"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"According to Kambala : Light R,qs_from thejrwrl of thr Exallmt Traching s81 The first [sign] is like the appearance [of a mirage] to a thirsty deer.

The fifth sign is an unnamable radiance, which is like a cloudless sky. When you have obtained these signs you will have attained the mahamudra.12so Then, the fo ur empties appear in sequence: There arises the appearance or the \"empty,\" which is like moonlight in a cloudless sky. There is increase or the \"very empty;' which is like sunlight. There is attainment or the \"great empty,\" which is like an all-pervading complete darkness. There is luminosity or the \"all empty,\" which is like the dawn sky fr ee fr om the three causes of pollution. From Fi ve Stages: Night is the aspect of appearance, which is clarity. The spreading of sunlight is the increase of appearance. Darkness is the attain­ment of appearance. By their own natures, they do not come at one time. That which is not night, day, nor darkness is completely devoid of a nature of its own. The supreme guru has called it instantaneous enlightenment, and that is the goal of the supreme yogin.'2s1 Dualistic appearances have yet to be purified during analogous luminosity. Therefore, even though the perception of pure space has appeared, it is when true luminosity is attained that [conceptual] elaboration is purified. That is why it is so named.

Those who are able to unite the two will not remain in either samsara or nirvana. 12tH The special union in the path of the tan eras is the union of method, which is innate bliss, with wisdom, which is the emptiness of luminosity.

Just as a swift fish leaps out fr om clear river water, so a network of illusory manifestations arises fr om the clear all-empty.1295 This [illusory body] comes from the wisdom of the single luminosity that results fr om the successive dissolution of the empties and fr om its accom­panying subtle air element that is [the wisdom's] steed. It is taught to be the vajra body-the essence of Vajradhara, which is as inseparable as your shadow and cannot be destroyed by anything. From Lamp of the Compen­dium of Pr actices: Therefore, the host of appearances that have the one basis of emp­tiness create the appearances of all worlds, just like space creat­ing appearances.

The Tantra of True Un ion teaches fo ur conducts: avadhitti conduct, excel­lent conduct, vrata conduct, [ 404] and victorious conduct. Some texts teach [only] two categories of conduct: avadhitti conduct and excellent conduct. Avadhitti conduct is also named shaking-o./f310 conduct, princely conduct, and the secret conduct. Excellent conduct is also named victorious conduct, the regent's conduct, and great GaJJapati's conduct. According to the Samdyoga Ta ntra there are fo ur conducts: the conduct of beginners, the conduct of those with some power of wisdom, the conduct of those with greater power of wisdom, and the conduct of liberation. In Cakrasa111vara and the Essence of Accomplishment1311 teachings, there are four conducts: excellent conduct, secret or hidden conduct, vrata con­duct, and victorious conduct. These [tea chings] mostly correspond with the key points taught in the Tantra of True Union, although there are a few dif­ferences in terms of the names and nature of the conducts. The gurus have taught that during the beginner stage, correctly keep the general and special commitments and vows, which are the excellent conduct, and whether you are lay or ordained, dedicate yourself to meditation on a path free from transgressions. Follow this conduct until you attain the sign of heat in the meditative equanimity of the completion stage. During the stage when there is some power of wisdom, do not actually per­fo rm the activities of a yogin but, while avoiding all transgressions, secretly engage in the Mantrayana conduct: practicing with a consort, [consuming] the five meats and the five nectars, and so on. This is called the secret or hid­den conduct. Engage in this conduct until your realization is stable within both meditation and post-meditation. During the stage when wisdom has greater power, engage with your con­sort in the Dharma of the yogin, practicing all the Mantrayana vratas in a group. This is the vidyd-vrata conduct.

The first level, Perfect Joy, which is the path of seeing, is when one man­ifests true luminosity. The second level, Stainless, up to the twelfth level, Endowed with Wisdom, which are all the path of meditation, is when there is the training in union. The thirteenth level, the Vajra Level, which is the path of completion, is when the nontraining union is manifest. THE PARTICULAR WAY OF THE MOTHER TANTRA TRADITION The beginner's level, which is the path of accumulation, is when mental sta­bility in the two stages is attained, all conditions are transformed into the path, and immaculate experiences arise. The level of aspiration, which is the path of engagement, is when the wind enters the central channel and there is the manifestation of the analogous innateness, which is the inseparability of bliss and emptiness in the descent of the fo ur joys, and the increase of the excellent qualities of the channels and winds.

These seven aspects, according to VagiSvarakirti, are:"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"610 ,\\l,th.imudr.i .md Rcl.ztrd !nJirurtiom Sarpbhoga[ kiiya]. union, great bliss, having no nature, being completely filled with compassion, being continuous, and being without cessation: ( 416] The buddhahood that has the seven aspects I have stated here is also stated validly by wise ones with complete meditation.11M6 The sarpbhoga aspect is the kaya created from the inseparability of wind and mind and adorned by the primary and secondary signs. The aspect of union is to remain in union with the vidyd with whom there is intercourse. The aspect of great bliss is to be filled with immaculate great bliss. The aspect of having no nature is that things and so on have no existence of their own. The aspect of being filled with compassion is the complete pervasion of great objectless compassion. The aspect of being continuous is remaining fo r as long as space exists. The aspect of being without cessation is presence throughout all time as the unceasing family. This [Vajradhara] has the nature of four kayas, three kayas, or two kayas: The svabhavakdya, or noncomposite dharmakaya, is the luminosity of the object, which has the two purities. The wisdom dharmakaya or great bliss kaya is the luminosity of the subject. However, dharmakdya is the name fo r the luminosity of the nonduality of subject and object. The form kaya based upon that, which is fo rmed from mind and wind alone, is called the sarrtbhogakdya. These two kayas are one in essence, only differing in terms of contrasts. Therefore, together they are the nondual wisdom kay a or the union kay a. As that [ kaya] is filled com­pletely with compassion, there arise many emanations, such as the supreme nirmal).akaya, in order to benefit the infinite beings that are to be trained. These are called the nirmd1J.akdya. Some explain that the three kayas are the seven aspects: The dharmakaya, which is free of all elaboration, is the aspect of having no nature. The sarpbhogakaya is created in Akanigha, where the union kaya, adorned by the primary and secondary signs, appears to pure pupils. Those"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"Light Rt�Ys.from thr}ru•rl o_(the F.x ullmt Teaching 611 are the three aspects of sa111bhoga. union, and great bliss. The nirma�:takaya is the uninterrupted accomplishment of benefit fo r various pupils through various methods. Those are the three aspects of great compassion, continu� ity, and having no cessation. However, although this explanation exists, it is not the meaning of the seven aspects. b. 1he wawy in which the kdyas ofbuddhahood manifest This is in two parts: i. How to gain the supreme siddhi in this life [ 41 7] ii. How to gain the supreme siddhi in the bardo or in fu ture lives i. Ho w to ga in the supreme siddhi in this life The supreme individual can attain the supreme [siddhi] in this lifetime. From the Tantra ofTrue Un ion: The buddhahood that is achieved after tens of millions of incalculable eons you will accomplish through sacred bliss even within this lifetime.1387 THE PROCESS It is taught that having concluded all generation and completion stages and attained training union, engaging in conduct will bring attainment of the signs of supreme accomplishment: the eight qualities of lordship. From Lamp of the Compendium of Practices: Through training in the three kinds of conduct fo r half a month, or fo r one month, or fo r six months, there will appear signs of the attainment of the siddhi of mahamudra. These are the signs: subtle fo rms, lightness of touch, pervasion, true attainment, com­plete appearance, stability, power, and the fu lfillment of a variety of desires.1388 If you attain the signs of supreme accomplishment, or see that you are capable of the conduct that is its direct cause, then in one week you will attain accom­plishment through that conduct of the direct cause. From the fajra Tent:"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"611 Af,zh,imudrti and Refilled Instructions It can be accomplished in one day, or in two days through the ritual, or three days through the yoga, or similarly, in fo ur days. The fifth day of yoga will accomplish it without a doubt. Make offerings with flowers and so on. Rest in stable meditation. Unite with the mudra. Correctly practice the vajra offering. When the vajra sun has set, if you practice this yoga correctly, there is no doubt that when the sun rises, there will be accomplishment.1389 The external enlightenment is at the time of dawn. The inner enlightenment is uniting with the mudra. At the moment when there is luminosity from the dissolving of the winds, the ordinary body is purified. This will manifest the wisdom body that is the inseparability of the ultimate luminosity from the immaculate body, which is like a rainbow. From the Vaj ra Tent: The mahamudra siddhi is the great siddhi. It is not the province of all siddhis. At that time its body is obtained, and instantly, there is great bliss. Instantly, [you have] the retinue, the meditation, the mantra, and instantly [you are] Buddha Vairocana, whose shoulders are embraced by Locana. l.wo It's taught that countless marvelous signs appear at the time of the supreme siddhi. From the Ta ntra of'Tr ue Union: [418] When the vidya is accomplished, there will be this kind of excel­lence: The earth will shake in six ways because of its joy, pleasure,"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"Light Ra_l'J.from thr.frwrl of rhr E.wrllrnr Traching 613 and delight.

Countless male and fe male deities will offer many specific offerings and supplicate you, calling out, \"Victory! Vic­tory!\" and declaring \"Excellent!\" ii. The way to ga in the supreme siddhi in the bardo or in future lives The medium individual achieves the supreme siddhi in the bardo. From Oral Transmission: Because of some deluded thoughts about self, [your] physical body will be left behind. You will not attain accomplishment in this life, but your mind can accomplish the vajra body, and you will gain true accomplishment in the bardo.1392 THE PROCESS Those who have mastered the generation stage are extremely adept in absorp­tion into luminosity and arising as the illusory body. When they die, the luminosity of death will manifest as the true luminosity. If it doesn't, then the illusory body will appear instead of the bardo, and they will attain the supreme siddhi in that fo rm. From Oral Transmission: When my mind enters into space, there is clarity and joy, a realization that is like space. Then, when the fo rm of a child of five years who possesses miraculous powers is created, there is bliss beyond example and perfect realization. When I am propelled fr om there into another life, the emanation fo rm will be truly, perfectly realized.

Those who have applied themselves to the two stages and have gained experience in the instructions of illusory body and dream take control in the bardo and transform it into the path, preventing impure rebirths and taking birth as a vidyadhara, and attain the supreme siddhi with that as a basis. From Oral Transmission: If the three kayas are not accomplished, I will become a chief vidyadhara and eventually accomplish the mahamudra.1394 Moreover, those who have received empowerments, kept the commitments, meditated as much as they can on the two stages, and made pure prayers will also gain a special rebirth and before long will attain the supreme siddhi. From the Vajra Tent: Even if they do not attain enlightenment, [ 419] they will be born again and again into a life as a cakravartin or otherwise will be born as kings. They will truly go to pure realms, be born as one of the wise in Sukhavatl, or among the <;lakin is, or in T u�ita.1395 There is also the previous teaching on the attainment of buddhahood in three, seven, or sixteen lifetimes. c. The uninterrupted activity of the kay as of buddhahood From Ornament of Realization: Thus, it is said that for as long as there is samsara, this activity will be an uninterrupted continuity.1396 Thus, it is taught that the activity of buddhas continues fo r as long as there is samsara.

The body of the Buddha appears in the perception of those to be trained and benefits beings.

In that same way, although the Lord is without effort and so on, the Buddha's speech pervades all beings without exception.1402 The love and knowledge of the [Buddha's] mind pervades like clouds: Rain falls effortlessly from the monsoon clouds causing harvests to grow.

This passage means that though the perfection of wisdom is the goal, the name is also used fo r the path to it. 46 S The spelling may appear to be incorrect, as the classical Sanskrit fo rm is am11naskdr11. In a compound, man11s fo r mind should not be declined. Ma ntZSi means \"in the mind;' literally. Maitripa defends this grammatical fr om in his TeachingAm11nasikdra (Amllnllsikdroddd.,, Toh 2249 Tengyur, rgyud, wi, I38bs). A great deal of Buddhist literature, including sutras, is not written in Classical Sanskrit but fr om a merger of Classical Sanskrit with Middle Indic languages that developed separately fr om ancient, Vedic Sanskrit. Since the work of Edgerton in the twentieth century, this fo rm of Sanskrit has become known as Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. Pali is an example of a Middle Indic language, and Pali also has the terms manasikdra and dmanllsikdrll. In this edition at least, the marker fo r the long vowel in kar11 is missing. Most commonly, this term refers to pay­ing attention when teachings are being given. Its opposite, a negative quality, is inattentiveness. Here as a positive quality. however, this has been translated as \"nonattcntion,\" although according to Maitripa's gloss it should be \"attention on [the syllable] a.\" 466 Manjufrindmasal'flgiti, Toh 360 Kangyur, rgyud, ka, 2a3. There are variations fr om the canonical text because the quotation is obtained fr om a translation of Mai­tripa's Teaching AmantZSikdra ( 13 9b7 ), so that the translation inevitably differs. and the Sanskrit may also have differed. The canonical version reads: \"The a syllable is"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"6s4 Mahdmudrd and Related Instructions the supreme syllable./ lr is rhe sacred, unchanging, great meaning./ It is the great life fo rce and it is birrhless./ lr is beyond that which is described in words.\" 467 Hevajra Ta ntra, book 2, 4:44. 21a1. Situ has derived this quote from the translation of Maitripa's Teaching Amanasikdra (140a2). In that translation the order of rhc words has been considerably rearranged, and there could well be some corruption in irs transmission. The translation of the quotation as given in the text would read \"[She who is] the nature of the first vowel, Dhiti (Intelligence), is named Prajfia (Wisdom). She is Bhagavati Prajfia. The union of the stage of perfection .... \" This verse is in fa ct a parr of the description ofNairatmya, Hevajra's consort. 468 Avikalpapravefadhdra1')i, To h I 42 Kangyur, mdo sde, pa. Though there are similar phrases throughout this short text, this quotation does not appear. This quotation is given however in Maitripa's Teaching Amanasikdra (139b2). However, in our edi­tion of the Situ text, \"gained\" (blang) has been replaced by \"eliminated\" (spangs). 469 Avikalpapravefadhdra1')i, To h 142 Kangyur, mdo sde, pa.

Sakapdrthiva, literally \"vegetable king,\" is a compound that was understood to mean idka-bhoji-pdrthiva, \"vegetable-eating king.\" The Tibetan translates this as \"king of leaves\" (to ma'i rgyal po ). Here Maitripa is stating that amanasikdra is an abbreviation of akdramanasikdra (attention on the syllable a) and so the syllable a at rhe front is not, as it is normally taken to be, a negation. Despite this explana­tion, the Tibetan still translates the a as a negative here. Maitripa also uses technical Sanskrit grammatical terms and used a word compound as an example, but the Tibetan has none of these specific grammatical fe atures and has thus become inevi­tably obscure.

The same necklace worn succes­sively by an ordinary citizen, a minister, or a king changes the level of its status even though the necklace itself does not change. The same fo od eaten by those three enables the individuals to accomplish different goals. Similarly there is not the slightest difference in terms of the vows that are to be kept-they are all simply avoidance of the ten bad actions and practice of the ten good actions. Held by individuals at different levels, however, they enable different levels of results. 6 s 2 This is in reference to lifespan, happiness, virtuous minds, and their opposites. 6 s 3 Sherab Jungne in his own commentary to the text defines what he means by the human and divine Dharmas. The human Dharmas are what are necessary fo r humans within this world, while the divine Dharma is that which brings libera­tion from it. The sixteen human Dharmas are (1-10) avoiding the ten bad actions; (II-IS) respecting father, mother, brahmans, monastics, and elders; and (I6) accu­mulating merit through generosity. The specific mention of brahmans appears to give this an Indic origin. During the development of a legal system in the subse­quent medieval period, it appears that avoiding the ten bad actions became sepa­rated out as the ten divine Dharmas, thus eliminating its soteriological perspective, and a new version of the sixteen human Dharmas developed that incorporated practicing the Dharma as one of its rules. This became attributed to the seventh­century king Songtsen Gampo, giving it more prestige, and it became dominant, eclipsing the version fo und here. In the present-day system the sixteen human dhar­mas are (I) devoting oneself to the Three Jewels, (2) seeking out and practicing the Dharma, (3) repaying the kindness of one's parents, (4) respecting the learned, (s) honoring elders and those of high status, (6) helping neighbors and the people of one's area, (7) being honest and humble, (8) being on good terms with family and friends, (9) fo llowing and having enduring relationships with good people, (I o) being moderate in fo od and wealth, (I I) valuing those who have shown past kindness, (12) repaying debts on time, without cheating in terms of measure or weight, (q) harboring jealousy toward no one, (I4) shunning bad advice and being one's own person, (IS) speaking gently and little, and (I6) not being self-obsessed and being able to take on burdens. 654 In this text this means the three superior trainings of wisdom, conduct, and medi­tation, which bring liberation from samsara. See the preceding note fo r the later Tibetan reinterpretation and codification. 6s S The fo ur factors that create obstacles are: (I) an inability to take the vows (due, fo r example, to having committed the five worst acts, being born in the northern conti­nent of Kuru, or being an apparition); (2) an inability to keep the vows (due to debt, enslavement, being in the service of the king, or not having permission from one's parents); (3) an inability to obtain special qualities (because one is sick, fo r example); and (4) being prevented from benefiting others (because of being rejected by one's fo llowers, and so on).

The Tibetan tradition has made the debatable choice of choosing this particular tan­era as the \"root tantra\" among the various Cakrasaqwara tantras even though it is explicitly presented as a summary. Far from being a root tantra, it appears to be an appendix. There is little info rmacion on the deity or its practice. Most of its fifty­one tiny chapters deal with codes of communication between practitioners and a host of magic rituals chat use the Cakrasarpvara mantra fo r all kinds of remarkable ends, such as creating zombies, changing people into elephants, causing abortions. and transforming one's own body into that of a woman (it is assumed the reader is male) in the space of eleven days.

The word nd(ii can mean any rube or pipe as well as the physical veins and arteries of the body, but in this work it generally refers to the network of subtle channels, analogous to the nervous system, through which flow the winds that are mentally manipulated as part of tantric prac­tice. Although earlier commentaries emphasized that the channels were simply visualizations without a physical existence, later Tibetan tradition attempted to conjoin these with the medical tradition, with inconclusive results. Characteristics Vehicle (mthan ny id thegpa, lak$a'Jttytina). This can refer to the three Pi�ikas of all Buddhist traditions though it is sometimes used to refer to the Mahayana alone. It is synonymous with the surra tradition, or Causal Ve hicle, in contradistinction to the tantra, or Vaj rayana. Cittamatra (sems tsam). This school-also known as Yo gacara because of irs emphasis on meditation practice-propounded the view that all phenom­ena are merely manifestations of the mind, which alone is ultimately real. The school grew out of the teachings of Asailga and Vasubandhu in the fo urth century, and Candragomin was a principal exponent in the seventh century. While Buddhism was ofi:en polarized between the views of Cittamatra and Madhyamaka during this period, a kind of synthesis had taken place by the eighth century in the teachings of Santarak�ita and his student Kamala.Sila, who were both instrumental in transmitting Buddhism to Tibet. commitment being (dam tshig sems dp a', samayasattva).

The early sutras often pair or compare cakravartin kings and buddhas. Thus, the Buddha has his own wheel, but of Dharma instead of secular power. In the Mahayana, there are said to be three \"turnings,\" or more accurately \"rollings,\" of the wheel of Dharma. See the fo llowing notes and cakravartin above. Dharma wheel of the four truths (bden pa bzhi'i chos 'khor). This refers to the \"first turning of the Dharma wheel\" and includes all the sutras and Vinaya of the earliest Buddhist schools. The teaching of the fo ur truths, which is the teaching the Buddha gave to his first five pupils in Sarnath, is considered rep­resentative of these teachings. Dharma wheel of the nonexistence of characteristics ( mtshan ny id med pa 'i chos 'khor). This is the \"second turning of the Dharma wheel\" and includes such Mahayana sutras as the perfection of wisdom sutras, and the earlier sucras on emptiness that fe ature the bodhisattva Mafijusri prominently. Though the subjects are varied, including such sutras as those on Amitabha and his pure realm, this group of sutras is seen as emphasizing emptiness as represented by the Madhyamaka texts ofNagarjuna. Dharma wheel of perfect examination (legs par 'byed pa'i chos 'k hor). This is the \"third turning of the Dharma wheel\" and includes such sucras as those that emphasize that all phenomena are manifestations of the mind and that all beings possess a buddha nature. These sucras, though numerous and varied, tend to be represented by Asailga-who revealed some of these sutras from visions of bodhisattva Maitreya-and by the Yo gacara tradition. dharmadhatu (chos ky i dbyings). This term can mean the entire expanse of phe­nomena, but also the \"essential element\" of phenomena, which is emptiness, or an indivisible union of emptiness and fundamental clarity. dharmakaya (chos sku). The \"truth body\" of a buddha, in contradistinction to a buddha's corporeal fo rm body (rupakdya). Dharmakdy a originally referred to the teachings themselves, which remained as the Buddha's presence or body even after his fo rm body was gone.

Synonymous with samddhi and famatha, it means \"placed\" and \"fixed\" and is etymologically a fo rm of the dhi in samddhi. The clos­est translation would be \"concentration,\" fo r it means the mind fixed upon a point without deviation, but in a less technical context could simply be called meditation, as in the perfection of meditation (dhydnapdramitd). In Buddha's time the attainment of various levels of dhyana was the goal of many of his contemporaries and was a path that he tried. The night before his enlightenment at dawn, he is said to have gone through these levels of dhyana and then beyond them. doha (do ha).

This is a traditional, convenient enumeration of the various schools of Buddhism prior to the advent of the Mahayana. However the lists fo r these schools vary considerably, so the number eighteen is unlikely to be exact. They all developed from the initial schism within Buddhism into the Mahasailgi.ka and the more conservative Sthaviravadins. Subsequent schools were often the result of localized devel­opment among the widely dispersed sanghas.

Hevajra tantra (kye rdo rje'i rgy ud I brtags gny is). There are two separate texts that collectively are called the Hevajra Ta ntra, and as with other tantras, such as the Cakrasarpvara, the chapters appear to have accumulated over time as a compilation of discrete texts and manuals.

In Vedic literature he is the supreme lord of the devas, living on Meru and wielding a thunderbolt. Later, the personification of the universal fo rce Brahman as Brahma, in a higher paradise above Indra, relegated Indra to second place. During the histori­cal Buddha's time, which was before the rise of Siva and Vi�QU, these two deities were the principal deities. In Buddhist cosmology, a number of par­adises above Mount Meru came to be envisaged, making Indra even less significant. Indrabodhi. This is synonymous with Indrabhiiti, but it does not refer to only one person. In the Guhyasamaja tradition he is the King of Oddiyana, who first received these teachings. There was also an Indrabhiiti who studied under Tilopa. Another Indrabhiiti was the King ofZahor, which is variously identified as the eastern region of present-day Bihar and with the Kangra val­ley in Northwest India. innate union (than cig skye sbyor; sahajayoga ).

The \"land of the rose­apple tree\" originally designated India alone, but later, in the lndocentric Buddhist cosmology that developed, it came to mean our world. Ka.lacakra (dus ky i 'khor lo ). Literally, \"wheel of time,\" Kalacakra is the latest and the most complex of the Buddhist tantras. It appeared in India some­time around the tenth century. Sometimes, instead of being classed with Cakrasarpvara and Hevajra as a yogini or mother tantra, it is given a class of its own: nondual tantra.

The Tibetan tradition assumes all Nagarjunas to be one author. nirmiJ:iakaya (sprul pa'i sku ). One of the two form bodies (rupakdya ) of a bud­dha. The \"emanation body\" is the fo rm of a buddha that appears in this world, perceivable by other beings, in contradistinction to the sar(lbhoga kdya, which can only be seen by enlightened beings. To gether these are classed as the \"form body\" of a buddha. The idea of nirmaQakaya was also extended to emanations that are not obviously a buddha: seemingly ordinary beings, ani­mals, and even matter, such as bridges, boats, fo od, or whatever would assist beings. The Tibetan term has also become institutionalized to mean anyone who is recognized as the rebirth of a lama. NirmiJ:iarati. \"The enjoyment of emanations.\" The fifth of the six paradises within the realm of desire, according to the Abhidharma. nirvana (mya ngan la s 'das pa; nirvdr;a). Nirvana comes from the term \"to blow out,\" as in extinguishing a candle, and therefore means \"extinguishment\" or even \"extinction\" in the sense of ending the succession of lifetimes and their cause. The Tibetan interpretative translation means \"transcending samsara.\" objecdessness (mi dmigs pa, dmigs pa med pa; anupalabdhi or anupalambha). Literally \"nonperception.\" This is also translated as \"nonreferentiality.\" It is in effect a synonym for emptiness. 094iyana ( 0 rgy an). This land where the tantras were promulgated and preserved-which is also called the land of gakinis-has a quasi-mythical sta­tus in relation to the Tibetan tradition. It has, however, been identified as the ancient Buddhist kingdom of Udyana in the Swat Valley of northwest Paki­stan, though there is no evidence for the practice of higher tantras there. More recent research has brought attention to the region of Orissa (renamed Odisha in November 2010) on the eastern coast of India, which has had a number of variant names but was known as Oggiyana up to at least the fourteenth cen­tury. It was a center for the practice of the higher tantras and was the region where many Buddhist tantras, such as Kalacakra, originated. Lake Chilika, the second largest lagoon in the world, matches the legend of O<;l<;liyana's lake. pa.Q4ita. A title given to an individual recognized for his or her learning.

Perfection Vehicle (phar phyin theg pa, pdramitdy dna ). \"The yana of the [six] perfections\" is an alternative name fo r the Mahayana's sutra tradition. perfections (pardmita,pha rol tu phyin pa). See six perfections performance tantra (spyod rg yud, caryd). These are texts and practices based upon the Ma hdvairocana Surra, popularly known as the Ma hdvairocana Tantra . This is important fo r the Chinese and Japanese tantric traditions. In contemporary Tibetan Buddhism, performance tantra is primarily rep­resented by the practice of Sarvavid Vairocana but is considered inferior in praxis and view to the higher tantras. pisaca (sha za). A class of demons, dating back to the Ve das, whose name is derived either from their yellow color (pita) or their appetite fo r flesh (piia). The Tibetan translates according to the latter meaning, rendering the term as \"flesh eaters; although there is no direct correlation in Tibet's own culture. prama.Qa (tshad ma). \"Validity\": the study of logic and epistemology, or \"valid . . \" cogmnon. prajiia's wisdom (shes ra b ye shes). Although prajizd is usually translated as wis­dom, and jndna is synonymous with it, prajizd-jizdna in the context of an empowerment is a reference to the consort, who is referred to as prajizd. This is the third empowerment, in which one gains wisdom through union with the consort. pra.Qa (srog rlung). This can mean simply \"breath,\" but it never means \"air\" in general as vdyu can mean. It is associated with the principle of life and so was translated into Tibetan as \"life air.\" This has been used as a back translation fo r rlung in general, though technically it is specifically one of the five prin­cipal winds. pra.Qayama (srog rtsol). \"Restraining or controlling the breath.\" This refers to spe­cific breathing practices, primarily involving breath retention. The Tibetan is literally \"life effort,\" referring to the deliberate control of the \"life\" breath. pratyekabuddha (rang rgy al). In early Buddhism, in contrast to those who were \"disciples\" (frdvaka), these individuals attained buddhahood not with a teacher but through contemplation of the remains of humans in charnel grounds and so on. In the Mahayana tradition in India there was disagree­ment as to whether their attainment equaled that of the Buddha. In present­day Tibetan Buddhism, the differing views continue, with the Kagyii, fo r example, declaring that their realization is less than chat of a buddha, while Gelukpas state that while the realization is the same, they lack the compas­sionate activity fo r others. preta (yi dwags). One of the six classes of existence, these beings suffer from continuous hunger and thirst. The S;mskrit literally means \"departed\" and is inspired by the pitr. or ancestral spirits of India, who, without descendants"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"718 Mahdmudrd and Rela ted Instructions to make the regular traditional offerings to them, are tormented by hunger and thirst. primary and secondary signs . These are the signs, or marks, of a great being. There are thirty-two primary and eighty secondary fe atures. The Buddha is said to have had all these fe atures, such as the mark of wheels on the soles of his fe et. There were also 2.16 birthmarks that were considered as \"auspicious signs.\" In the Vajrayana, they are said to be possessed by all the deities. propensity (bag chags, vdsana). The Sanskrit term is derived from a scent or smell lefi: behind and therefore has the meaning of a trace or impression. The Tibetan has an emphasis on habitual action, or even the apparently instinc­tive, such as the first actions of a newborn animal. It can also have the mean­ing of a seed, a latent tendency to act in a certain way, or even, in the Mind Only school, that which causes one's apparently external experiences, as these are said to arise entirely from one's own mind. purapravesa (grong Jug). Literally \"entering a town:' it was also known as parakdyapra vesha (gzhan gyi lus la Jug pa ), \"entering another's body:' This was a practice designed so that one could transfer one's consciousness into another vacated body, either temporarily or fo r a lifetime within that body. quintessence. See hindu; tilaka raksasa (srin po ). A class of demons in Indian culture, and though there are vari­ous types of them, the most known are the ferocious man-eating kind. rishi (dra ng srong, r#). This well-known Indian title originally referred to some­one who had received a revelation from the deities of a divine scripture. The term later became one of general respect to a religious master, including the Buddha. The Tibetan translation is \"straight:' meaning an unwavering mind. Rudra (ru dra). The name first appears in Indian literature in the Ve das as the deity of the jungles, outside civilization. He became a principal deity much later and eventually, under the name of Siva, one of the most important dei­ties in India today. The tantric deity Cakrasa111vara is said to destroy Rudra/ Siva, but then adopts his body, sacred sites, and so on. In Tibet, Rudra is most ofi:en used as the symbol of powerful, self-fixated, deviant mind. sadhana (sgrub thabs). The term may denote \"ac complishment\" or the .. method of accomplishment;' which is the way it is translated into Tibetan. It can refer to any method of practice, usually of a deity, and by association it can mean the liturgical text used in the practice of meditation on a deity that describes the visualizations, mantras, offerings, prayers, and n1editations to be performed. sage (thub p,z ; muni).

This could literally be translated as \"concentration:· meaning when the mind is completely focused. It therefore refers to a state of meditation free from distraction. samadhi being (ting 'dzin sems dp a', samddhisattva). In deity meditation, the samddhi being is the insignia and/ or syllable in the deity's heart, symbolizing its essence, as opposed to the fo rm, and is so named because that is what the mind concentrates upon during the practice. samayasattva (dam tshig sems dp a'). See commitment being saqtbhogakaya (long spyod rdzogs pa'i sku). A later subdivision of the fo rm body of a buddha, which in earlier Buddhism meant solely the physical presence of the Buddha in this world. As Mahayana and later tantric literature were derived primarily from visions, these immaterial manifestations became an additional subdivision of the fo rm body. As these beings were free of any of the fa ilings of a human body, such as the sickness, aging, and death that affiicted the buddha's fo rm body, they were known as \"bodies of complete enjoyment\" [of the qualities ofbuddhahood]. This was then an essential cat­egory fo r establishing the canonical n_ature of these later teachings. Sarma (gsarma). Literally \"new,\" this contrasts with the \"old\" or Nyingma (rnying ma) tradition, which has its origins in the first introduction ofBuddhism to Tibet in the seventh and particularly eighth centuries. The Sarma traditions are based on teachings that were brought to Tibet from the eleventh century onward, beginning with the translations ofLotsawa Rinchen Sangpo. Sautrantika (mdo sde pa). The \"followers of the sutras:· an Indian Buddhist tradi­tion that rejected the canonical status of the Abhidharma.

It primarily refers to the practice of reciting a great number of mantras in conjunction with meditation on a specific deity. This is understood as both a process of familiarization to bring one's mind closer to the deity and thus to the nature of one's own mind and, in a dualistic sense, a propitiation of the deity. In the more dualistic approach of the lower tan­tras, this propitiation of the deity ultimately results in the deity's appearance to the devotee to grant a boon or siddhi. Siddhartha (don yod grub pa): The Buddha's personal name. It means literally \"goal accomplished.\" six existences (rigs drug). The six types of existence in samsara are rebirth as a hell being, preta, animal, human, asura, or deva. six perfections (phar phyin drug, safPdramitd). The six central practices of a bodhisattva on the Mahayana path: the perfections of generosity, good con­duct, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom. The Tibetan fo r pdramitd literally means \"gone to the other shore\" (pha rol tu phyin pa). sravaka (nyan thos). \"Disciple.\" The word is derived from the verb \"to study\" and also \"to hear;' and the Tibetan translation is \"one who listens and hears.\" This general term was used in contrast with those who attained enlightenment without a teacher, the pratyekabuddha, with whom the sravaka exemplifies the Hinayana. In early Buddhism the path of the sravaka was the direct path to liberation, while a bodhisattva, committed to becoming a buddha and not just free of samsara, had to accumulate merit fo r many eons. Sravaka Vehicle (nyan thos theg pa, frdvakaydna). \"The way of the disciples;' a term that is often used as a synonym fo r the Hinayana in contrast with the Bodhisattva Vehicle of the Mahayana. ten strengths.

The Sanskrit vrata simply means a \"vow,\" but it is commonly used in Hinduism andJainism to refer to the practice of fasting. The Tibetan means \"entering into subjugation\" and could be translated as \"discipline,\" but the term is associated most often with extraordinary behavior that is the very opposite of what we think of as discipline. In that context, it is defined as subjugating ordinary conduct and entering into extraordinary conduct. This may entail living in a charnel ground, fo r instance, or engaging in vari­ous kinds of unpredictable behavior. wind (rlung, vdyu ). The word vdyu can mean air or wind, or even the god of the air. In the context of the higher tantras it can simultaneously mean the exter­nal element of air, the breath, and the winds or energies that flow through the body that cause digestion, defecation, and so on. These grosser winds can be transformed into wisdom winds thorugh completion-stage practices. wisdom being (ye shes sems dp a';jiidnasattva).
