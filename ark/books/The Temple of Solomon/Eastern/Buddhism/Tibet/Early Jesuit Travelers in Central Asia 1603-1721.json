MARKHAM 1). To many generations of geographers Central Asia, especially Tihet, was the land of mystery and darkness, isolated by nature and by man, in whose midst lay the sacred city of Lhasa, even more mysterious and unapproachable than Mecca or Kerbela; and it is only for some decades past that it has counted among the great fields of operation of modern geography. High as Mont Blanc are the desert-like plateaux of this \"Roof of the World\", and as if this elevation was not enough to render them difficult of access, they are set about by almost impassable mountain ranges; an arctic climate reigns in those bleak and forlorn regions. And if a traveller be so undaunted and hardy as to brave all the obstacles of nature, and to climb his way towards those icy wastes, he will find his road barred and himself ruthlessly turned back by the sparse inhabitants, inhospitable as their mountain sides. Hardly any explorer from Prejevalsky to Sven Hedin but testifies to the jealousy with which those desolate regions are guarded, and even as late as 1923 Dr. Montgomery McGovern experienced this inveterate distrust of the foreigner. It has not always been thus. This aversion did not exist in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, before Chinese domination had influenced Tibet and grafted its own love of seclusion on its inhabitants. It was this milder feeling towards strangers from the West that allowed some Jesuit missionaries to explore the coun-try. They entered it from the south and from the north, they traversed it along the valleys of the Indus and the Tsangpo, they 1) Losl Geographical Documents.-Geographical Journal (1913) vol.

They did, indeed, like their fellow-workers in other climates, record their experiences, but, strange to say, most of their writ-ings remained hidden away in dusty archives, and the few things given to the world were vague and hazy and, to some minds, more suggestive of fiction than of fact, and thus cast a shadow of un-certainty even over the few facts that had actually become known, justifying Hedin's remark that \"over the interior of the vast Asiat-ic Continent there hovered a pale reflection, faint and shadowy, of the journeys of Marco Polo and the old Jesuits\" 1). This aspect of things has changed of late years. The merits of those \"old Jesuits\" have come more to the front, and more than once have met with due recognition at the hands of competent judges. At the same time criticism has not been idle: it has be~n caustic, it has even been unfair -the more unfair as being hased on ignorance or superficial knowledge. What the late Dr. Sieg-mund Gunther, of Munich, wrote to me some years ago, is emi-nently applicable to Tibet: \"That the Jesuits have done much for our geographical knowledge is recognized on all hands; what they have done we hardly know at all.\" It is here we have one of Mark-ham's undiscovered regions \"for the historical explorer to unearth''. All the journeys that have been u!'ldertaken in Tibet by Jesuit missionaries will be treated of in the present work. The writer has had access to old books and other publications of which but few copies are known to exist, but the bulk of the information here presented was never published at all, and is derived from a large number of manuscripts which it has been his good fortune to \"un-earth\" in the archives of the Society of Jesus. Each of the follow-ing chapters will have its own list of MSS. appended. The object which the writer has tried to keep constantly in view, is to deter-mine the scientific value of those letters, journals &c., to place the merits of their writers in their proper light, and thus to assign to them their rightful place among those who have contributed to-1) Sven Hedin, Scientific ResuUs of a Journey in CentYal Asia z8gg-zgoz {Stock· holm 1907) IV, 531."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PREFACE VII wards the development of geographical science. Hence the subject has been treated with such fulness as the limits of the book would pennit, and, while drawing on every accessible source of informa-tion, the data furnished by the old documents have been tested by the light of the facts supplied by modem travellers. A few points should not be forgotten, if we would arrive at an equitable judgment. Those men had not been, as a rule, prepared for their arduous undertakings by thorough geographical and ethnical studies; they did not set out richly equipped with physic-al instruments of various kinds; they were pioneers in the fullest sense of the word; without any precursors, without maps, without the experience of others to guide them. Nor, while they were out in regions untrodden by European foot, did they consider them-selves in the first place discoverers who were making a name for themselves; geographers adding fresh data to the stock of human ki1owledge; explorers widening the horizon of the human mind; -before everything else they were, and remained, missionaries going out to cast abroad the seeds of the Gospel wherever human heart would give it soil; whose one ultimate purpose was to gain so\\•.ls rather than to discover territories; who never lost sight of their raison d' etre, and therefore carried into their enterprises the same indomitable energy and daring that had called them away from friends and home to brave the perils of the deep without any wish or hope of gain or glory. Thus they must not be looked upon as geographical specialists, but as honest, level-headed men, writ-ing of their experiences in a land of bewildering strangeness; their writings should not be perused by the light of the exacting canons of the specialist who reports for a geographical magazine or to a learned society. They should be read, with a critical eye indeed, but not in a spirit of fault-finding, and as to the facts reported, with a bias in their favour unless they can be shown to have erred. Certainly they did make mistakes, as who does not? Their written accounts are often insignificant, abounding in generalities and hopelessly lacking in those points which a scientific training would have made them pick up as of first rate importance. But even so they have theh merits as every pioneer has. Each chapter of this book is complete in itself and can be read independently.

This chapter and the following on Andrade were published in Dutch some years ago 1) ; as they appear here, they have been corrected and in large part re-written. The writer does not feel called upon to premise a detailed geo-graphical and physical description of Tibet. The books of travel and exploration that have appeared of late years are so numerous, and the character both of the country and its inhabitants have become so generally known that the map appended to the book may be deemed a sufficient guide for the general reader. Finally there remains the pleasant task of recording the kind help and the valuable suggestions which I have received from so many quarters, and I wish to express here my deep sense of grati-tude to the numerous friends and correspondents who have thus contributed towards the making of this book. Though it is impos-sible for me to mention them all individually I cannot forbear to name two whose claims transcend all others: Father Henry Hosten, S. J., of St. Joseph's College, Darjeeling, the learned writer on the mission-history of India, who more than once directed my researches in my hunt for documents; and my friend Father Thomas Neervens, S.

Goes' diary, in which he noted down the various events day by day, has not come down to us in its en-tirety or in its original form. After his death it was destroyed by the Mohammedans at Su-cheu, and only a few fragments could be saved by his faithful Armenian travelling-companion Isaac, who took them to Pekin and placed them in the hands of the famous astronomer, Father Matthew Ricci, S.J. With the help of these precious remains and the oral account of the Armenian, Ricci pieced together the narrative of the journey as well as he might. That in this way inaccuracies should have crept in and that some parts should be incomplete will hardly cause surprise. Nor does it ap-pear as clearly as might be wished which are Goes' personal notes and what is due to Ricci's vast and thorough knowledge of China. With all this, however, Ricci's narrative remains the chief sour~. He inserted it in his memoirs, which he began to compose two years before his death ( 161 0). These memoirs were translated from the Italian and published in Latin by his fellow-missionary, Nico-las Trigault, a Belgian, under the somewhat pompous title oiDe Christiana Expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate ] esu ex P. Matthei Ricci ejusdem Societatis Commentariis 2). For close upon three centuries every student had been referred to this, in many places incorrect, translation, when some years ago P. Tacchi Venturi, S. J. had the good fortune to discover Ricci's original manuscript. Italian scholars were about solemnly to commemorate the third centenary of Ricci's death, and at the request of the com-mittee appointed to organize the national celebrations in honour of their great compatriot, Father Venturi prepared a critical 1) I have to thank the kindness of Seflor Augusto Ribeiro for the photograph of this statue. 1) The first edition was published at Augsburg in 1615.

He was back in Europe on business in 1615,retuming to China in 1618, where he was engaged in missionary labour till his death, which took place at Hang-cheu November 4, 1628.

Goes had the obscurest of problems committed to him for solution: What was Cathay? Was it China or was it some other territory? As his whole journey is guided and directed bythis question, which, moreover, repeatedly occurs in the later chapters of this book, a brief statement of the problem must be premise<\\ 8). Before the time of the Moguls (13th century). the name of Cathay had not been known in Europe. Originally it belonged to a people which was not Chinese, the Khitans, a Manchu tribe, who up to the tenth century occupied a tract of country in the north-east of China beyond the Chingan mountains. A conqueror arose among them, who soon extended their territory from the Sea of Kor~a to the Altai mountains, and before long they had pushed south as far as the left bank of the Hoang-ho.

The rulers, then, being Khitans, but the country itself an outlying part of the great Chinese empire whose civilization the conquerors had made their own, the neigh-bouring tribes began to apply the name of Khitan, Khitat or Khitai, to the latter country. And even to this day nearly all the nations which have come into touch with China by land, call the country Khitai. ·when in their turn the Leao dynasty and its suc-cessor had to yield before the savage Mongolian hordes under J en-gis-Khan {1206), the new conquerors considered themselves rulers of Khitai or Cathay. It is well known how these nomads bursting all barriers came pouring through the gate of Dzungaria deluging western Asia with their unrestrained hosts. Every boundary line, natural or political, was effaced, and ever wider poured the plund-ering bands over the plains of Siberia and Sarmatia, so that in a few years the Mogul empire stretched from the Yellow River to the Danube. European civilization seemed doomed, for no human power could stem the tide of destruction. One way alone remained:-to win those barbarians for the Catholic Church and through her for civilization. Inspired with these high aims tb.e first missionaries sought and found their way to the camp oo the \"Great Khan\". Encouraged by the friendly welcome extended to them, they penetrated further into darkest Asia. From the accounts of these intrepid apostles Western Europe learned for a second time of a great civilized people living in the farthest East, and was thus enabled to revive and increase what it had learned as long ago as the time of Augustus. It was especially the Francis-can Friars who distinguished themselves in giving new life to those ancient records, and among them special mention must be made of John of Plano Carpini (1246), William Roebroek (1254) and Odo-rico de Pm;denone ( 1316-1328). Their writings are only surpassed by the engrossing narrative of the famous Venetian Marco Polo. By all of them the country they described was called Cathay, as it was called by the Tartars, and its capital was Cambaluc 1). \"Further on,\" writes the keen observer Roebroek, \"lies Great-Cathay, and I think it is the country which the ancients called the country of the Seres. For it is from that territory that the best silk is exported, and the people themselves call such silks seric\". \"The inhabitants 1) The name is spelt in various ways: Marco Polo writes Cambaluc, Pordenone Cam-balech, others again Cambalu.

In the course of the following years the Catholics increased in such numbers that Pope Clement V. thought it necessary to send them bishops, and in 1307 John e Monte Corvino was appointed Arcihbshop of Cambaluc in Cathay 8). The impulse, however, that was to have ended in the victory of Christianity, did not last. As early as the second half of the foarteenth century the immense Mogul empire began to totter, and it was finally destroyed through the incessant attacks of the southern Cathays, the Chinese. The number of missionaries steadily decreased and with them that of the traders, who had followed in their track. Occasional mention, indeed, is still made of friars or bishops sent out by the papal court at Avignon, but they vanish in the gathering darkness and then -all is silence. The new con~ querors applying once more in the territories they had regained the ancient Chinese policy of isolation expelled all foreigners, while Islamism, temporarily repulsed by the Mongols, again closed its fatal grasp over Central Asia. In time a whole chain of Mahomedan nations severed almost completely the Far~ East from the West. The knowledge of Cathay grew vaguer and vaguer. A few notices reached Europe through the narratives of the Spaniard Gon-zales de Clavyo and of the Bavarian John Schiltberger, both of whom visited the court of Timur at Samarkand. At some greater length Nicolas Conti and Josaphat Barbaro spoke of what they had been told by others-about Cathay, but there was no fresh first-hand information. Fancy was free to adorn and invent.

But their elusiveness only increased their hold on the imagination. Columbus was not the only one to seek for a shorter way to Cathay, it was the object of every voyage \"round by the north''. For a while the mysterious country was thrust into the back-ground by the discovery of America and India, and on landing on the east-coast of Asia in 1514 the Portugueseheardnoancientnames that might recall it. They heard of China, Pekin, Canton, with-out being aware that at one time these places were well-known in the West. It was only when missionaries, this time starting from the ports, penetrated into the interior, that it began to be conjectured that China might be Great Cathay and Pekin the rich city of Cambaluc. Though the ancient Franciscan missionaries and Marco Polo did not employ the names now in use, yet tht!ir descriptions tallied perfectly with the people, the customs, the products and the trade. It was Matthew Ricci especially who championed this view. He states it as early as October 12, 1596, in a letter from Nankin 1). His opinion was strengthened by a visit to Pekin in September 1598. If Cathay, which by all writers was said to be a great country in the far East, was not China, then, so he argued, something should be known about it here, whether from war or from commercial relations. Such a country could not remain utterly unknown. His personal investigations and his discussions with the Persian traders he met with in the capital, finally disposed of every doubt as regards the identity of the two countries, and at the earliest opportunity he informed his friends in Europe and India of his results ll). As was to be expected his arguments did not command assent everywhere. Many unwilling to relinquish the country .of legend and fable set themselves to assign to it another place on the map; they distinguished between Cathay and China in the same way as before them Ptolomy had done between the country of the Seres and that of the Sinae.

As things were, it looked as if this uncertainty was to con-tinue indefinitely, especially as the Portuguese, having their great colonial empire on their hands, would hardly have occasion to go in search of countries still more remote. But an unlooked for event, which happened at the court of the Great Mogul in India, again brought the question of the situation of Cathay to the fore. This, however, necessitates our turning our attention to Goes. Bento de Goes was born in 1562 at Villa Franca do Campo, on the island of San Miguel, one of the Azores. Nothing is known with certainty about his family or his youth, though the rest o'f his career makes it probable that his education was thorough. Nor do we know for what reason he left his native country to sail for India, or why, when there, he joined the colonial army. After a life such as soldiers lead, and not over-edifying at that, he suddenly sobered down, and leaving his old ways begged for admittance into the Society of Jesus. His request was granted and he entered the noviciate of Goa in February 1584. Before completing his two ye~· noviceship he quitted and went to Ormuz. Regret soon followed and on applying he was again admitted, and by the end of March or the beginning of Aprill588, being twenty-six years old, he was a novice once more 1). It was noticed before long that the new lay-brother, for it was in that capacity that he had been admitted, was a man of talent, and he was several times given the option of entering upon a course of theology with a view to the priesthood, but from a feeling of humility he firmly declined. These few facts are historically certain. Of late years, however, doubts have arisen in Portugal 1} These particulars are taken from a MS. Annua Litlef'a ProvinciiJe Goanae anni r6o9, dated 27 December 1609 and addressed to the General of the Society. Under the heading \"Obitus Benedicti Goesii\" it contains a passage giving a short account of the Brother's life and of his journey. As his authority for the details concerning Goes' twofold admission into the Society the writer mentions Brother Antonius Magro. The latter is known to have entered the noviciate of Goa in October 1584 and must have lived with Goes under the same roof. In the list of the members of the mission-province of Goa, dated December 1584, the following statement concerning Goes occurs under n. 116: \"Oppido Villa Franca An-grensis Diacesis in Lusitania; :ZJ annos natus; robustus; ingressus esl anno I584, mense Februario; Ojficia domestica\". In the list for the year 1588, drawn up 31 December 158B,his name reappears under n. 146. \"Benito de Goes, Portugues de la Isla de Sant' Miguel, de la Villa Franca, Obis-pado de Angra; de 116 anos; robusto; de nueve meses de la Companhia.\""},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"8 BENTO DE GOES whether the name of Goes is the explorer's real name, or whether he adopted it on his change of life. The point being still under discus-sion a few words about it will not be out of place. The question was first raised by a romantic narrative entitled Bento de Goes, ·published by Jose de Torres at Ponta Delgada, Azores, in 1854. In it is described a young man called Luiz Gon!Yal-ves, who desperate from disappointed love takes ship for India and joins the army. After a few years he repents of his excesses, enters the Society of Jesus at Goa and changes his name into that of Bento de Goes. Whether this change of name is founded on fact Torres does not state. In any case his statement did not lack supporters, and for many the matter was settled, when it was found in 1903 that in the register of births at Villa Franca under date August 9, 1562 (the year of Goes' birth) there was entered the name of Luis Gon9alves, son of Manuel Gon~alves. In his memoir Ribeiro did not as yet accept the identity, though he admitted ics possibility. He also drew attention to the entire absence of Goes' nan1e in writings which might be expected to refer to him 1). This was said with special reference to the well-known historian of the Azores, Antonio Cordeiro,S. J., who in his description of the is4md of San Miguel speaks at length of all men and women of note with-out any mention of Goes; nor is his name cited among the nume-rous f~mily-names and pedigrees 2). This is the more significant when we remember that he was a Jesuit himself, and would not have been likely to omit the name of one of his confreres. The same silence is observed in the preface written by J. Barbosa; he compares Cordeiro's book with the description of Tibet by Anto-nio de Andrade, but does not speak of Goes. Yet it is at· least open to question whether the mere statement by Torres, the entry in the register for 1562, the silence of Cordeiro, and even the fact of his once mentioning the Gon~ves family at Villa Franca 8) are arguments weighty enough to warrant the identification of the names of Goes and Gon~ves. Whether Goes had any grave reason for changing his name it is impossible to say. We might be inclined to find a sufficient war· rant for such a change in his not very exemplary life as a soldier; 1) Ribeiro, p. 6. 1) Antonio Cordeiro, S. J., HistMia Insulana das ilhas a Portugal sugeitas no Oceano Occidental (Lisboa 1717), I, 171-311.

They certainly do not fail to men-tion the fact in parallel cases, and no plausible reason for their silence in the present instance can be adduced. The two most an-cient documents bearing on Goes, the lists of the members of the mission-province of Goa for the years 1584 and 1588 content them-selves with a few bare facts without reference to any change of name. Barbosa Machado's extensive bibliography is silent on the point 1). Nor has an examination of the register of births at the parish church of .Villa Franca do Campo resulted in establishing the identity. Rather the contrary. For one of those most deeply versed in the local history of Villa Franca, the Rev. Manuel Er-nesto Ferreira, to whom I applied for information, thus sums up the results of his inquiry: \"I have found nothing to prove the iden-tity assumed by Torres to exist between Goes and Gonc;alv~. At one time I accepted it as it was the general opinion 1); now I think it must be rejected\". Why? Because it is a fact that at one time there was a family of the name of Goes at Villa Franca. Among other dates the name is entered in 1567, 1582, 1598. In the firs~ of the.~ entries the father's name is de Goes, in the other cases it is the name of the mother. As a curious coincidence it may be men-tioned that in 1582 and 1598 the father is a Gonc;alves. Could not the absence of the name of Goes in 1562 be accounted for by the very dilapidated state of those old registers? 8) But how is Cordeiro's silence to be explained?

And in 1601 wishing to negotiate a peace with the viceroy of India the Emperor knew of no more tiusty ambassador than Brother Goes, and in token of his esteem he sent with him all the young Portuguese who had been carried off as prisoners of war. At Goa Goes met Father Nicholas Pimenta1), then Superior of the mission, a man of prudence and strong determination, fuD.y acquainted with all the manners and customs of the Mohamme-dans, and who spoke Persian, the commercial language of Central Asia, with fluency. He soon learned to knt:>w and value Goes, and when the question of Cathay was again mooted, he conceived the plan of sending him on a journey of exploration to the land of mystery 2). It was an event at Akbar's court which had once more drawn the attention to that lost territory. \"One day,\" Xavier wrote from Lahore to Goa in 1598, \"a Mohammedan merchant, about 60 years of age, was admitted into the presence of Akbar and related that he came from Xathai by way of Mecca. Pretending to be an am-bassador he had penetrated into the country and had lived in the q~opital, Xambalu, for thirteen years.

Struck by those accounts Xavier personally applied to the merchant for further information. Again he was assured that there was a considerable Christian population, and in the course of his narrative the merchant descended to such details as to dress and customs, that in asubsequentletter Xavier thought he could vouch for the truth of his former communication'). The merchant's report was the more readily accepted,since all medieval travellers had spoken of Christian communities in Cathay. Yet the account was false.

WhenJosaphat Barbaro made inquiries about Cathay among the Tartars at Tana, he was assured that the inhabitants were Christians, because they had images in their temples as the Christians had. And Anthony Jenkinson was told at Bokhara in 1559 that the religion of the people of Cathay was the religion of the Christians or at least strongly resembled it 1). We have seen how Ricci stood for the identity of Cathay and China. But Pimenta hesitated. For Ricci's positive statements did not square with the equally positive information coming from La-hore, and while the Mohammedan informants spoke of the presence of large numbers of Christians, Ricci was silent on this point 2). There must be a difference or an error, so Pimenta concluded, and a journey of discovery would not be out of place. Even though no new country shoulq be found, no neglected Christian communit~es be discovered, the expedition might possibly result in the opening up of a new land-route shorter than the dangerous sea-voyage. He made proposals to this effect to Philip II., who charged the vice-roy Ayres de Saldanha to forward the expedition to the best of his power; but, what was of far greater importance, Akbar's consent was easily obtained. He helped not only by letters of recommen-dation to the princes who were either his tributaries or his friends, but even contributed 400 gold pieces towards the cost of his friend's expedition, though the Khan's liberality was anything but proverbialll).

He was led to adopt this plan, partly at least, by the Theatrum Mun-di, according to which the distance between Lahore and the capi· tal of Cathay could be covered in six months 2). There can be no doubt that by the Theatrum Mundi the famous atlas of Ortelius is meant, which in fact contains a map of Russia, Muscovy and Tar-tary, designed and published in London by the above-mentioned Jenkinson. Commissioned by some English merchants the latter had in 1588 travelled through Russia and Turkestan with the definite object of finding the road to Cathay.

Leaving Agra October 29, 1602, our party arrived at Lahore December 8 8). Goes' first work on arriving was to dismiss his escort of servants as both cumbersome and useless, and to look for an-other suitable travelling-companion. Fortune favoured him, for he found one in the Armenian Isaac, whose loyal attachment was to prove invaluable to him. As the caravan for Kashgar started from Lahore only once a year, Goes could not set out on his journey before 24 February'). The party consisted of about 500 persons with a long train of beasts of burden, camels and waggons. After a month they reached Athec (Attock), where they crossed the Indus, which at this point was only a bowshot wide. Thence to Kabul through the mountain districts of Afghanistan was a perilous and difficult march. They had to protect themselves not only against the severities of the climate, but even more against the bands of marauders attracted by their merchandise. The road went by Passaur (Peshawar). Jelalabad, where the Chitral valley begins, and Ghideli (Jagdali?). Trouble arose even before they reached Peshawar and later on they were compelled to take an escort of 400 soldiers as a defence against the rapacity of the natives. 1) Guerreiro, (Relafam nos annos r6o7 e r6o8, c. 23) calls Grimanus a deacon; Du Jarric omits this detail. As early as 1590 Grimanus bad carried communications be-tween Akbar and the jesuit Fathers at Goa. Cf. Felix(p. 72)who calls him an Armenian. 1) From a detailed Latin report on the state of the mission addressed by Pimenta to the General and dated December 29, 1602, in which the Cathay expedition is briefly mentioned, we lf;larn that Father Anthony Machado, then rector of the college at Bas-sein, and Goes were selected for the enterprise. The latter was to start by himself in order to reconnoitre, after which he was to return to fetch the Father, who meanwhile would learn the language. According to Felix (p. 81 note 2) Machado arrived at Agra in 1602 and died there on April4, 1636. Why he did not join Goes, does not appear. 1) Ricci (Commentarj p. 529) places the date of the departure from Agra on January 6, 1603, which, however, is contradicted by the above-mentioned letter of Goes to Da Veiga, in which he distinctly mentions the date given in the text. Various erroneous dates are given: Brucker (p. 601) and Vasconcellos (p. 19) have October 2, Yule (II. p. 537) and Yule-Cordier (IV, p. 203) have October 31; Ettore Ricci (La Identificalione della Gina con il Catayo p. 8) and Machado (1, 504) have Ricci's date. 1) The MS. from which I quoted Goes' letter to Da Veiga contains a transcript of another letter from the same addressed to Jerome Xavier, dated Lahore February 24, 1603. For the sake of clearness I quote from the Latin translation appended to it: \"Hodie lneuntis Quadragesimae feria sexta instrumentum omne trans flumen praemisimus •..• Tempus est ut proficiscamur. Quare iis litteris finem impono.\" Hue (Le Christianisme II, 211) confuses the dates of the departure from Agra and the arrival at Lahore, and makes the 500 men composing the caravan into soldiers given as an escort to Goes by the King of Lahore."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"BENTO DE GOES 15 They had to make their way at the point of the sword, and the narrative of the journey notes that manyweremortallywounded, whilst the others nearly lost their lives in saving their valuables. In those mountainous districts with their ravine roads the beasts of burden were generally driven along the lower parts, whilst the escort made their way along the top of the rocks to pre-vent the brigands from crushing them by throwing heavy stones into the narrow gorge below. At this stage of his journey Goes learned some details about another no less savage tribe in the neigh-bourhood. \"Being on their way to a small town\", Ricci writes, \"they met a wandering hermit, who told them that at a distance of 30 days' march there was a territory called Caferstam, which no Mohammedan was allowed to enter. Those who penetrated into the country were punished with death, while heathen merchants went about unmolested, though they were debarred from entering the temples. He added further that they never entered their temples unless clothed in black, that the country was fertile, and that it produced grapes in great abundance. Bento tasted of the wine the hermit offered him and found it in no may different from ours. Drinking wine being contrary to all usage among Mohammedans he surmised that the inhabitants were Christians\" 1). The country in question is clearly Kafiristan, the hill-country north-east of the Kabul valley between the river Kunar and the Hindu Kush mountains. It is occupied by some tribes very jealous of their independence, who are called Kafirs (unbelievers) by the surrounding Mahommedans, though they are better known by the nameofSiah-Posh from the black colouroftheir garments 2). Goes' is probably the first mention of this remnant of a nation, for the Mohammedan historians of the middle-ages, on whom we must rely for the greater part of our information about the East, did not think it worth while to go into details about such despised un-believers, against whom they preferred to preach a war of exter-mination.

A more easterly route of greater difficulty but more direct was preferred. According to Ricci it went by \"Ciaracar [Charikar], where iron is found in abundance, to Paruan[Par:wan], a small town, the furthest frontier town of the empire of the Great Mogul, whose authority was consequently more a name than a reality, so that his letters freeing Goes of all taxes were of.little or no use\" 1). Charikar is situated at the mouth ofthe Koh-Daman valley, at the very foot of the Hindu Kush, while more to the north, at the junction of the Bajgah and Sar-Ulang passes, lies Panvan, already mentioned by Edrisi as a not very large but thriving town. Most probably, therefore, the caravan took the Bajgah or Parwan pass. Ancient writers speak of this pass as a very difficult one. In the earliest description of Kabulestan dating from the sixteenth century Sultan Mohammed Baber notes it as very dif-ficult, especially because between Parwan and the main pass there are seven smaller ones 2). In 1837, when on his still famous expe-dition to the sources of the Amu-darja, the Oxus of the ancients, Lieutenant John Wood followed more or less Goes' route and tried to cross not exactly by the Parwan pass but by the one next to it, the Sar-Ulang; the enormous depth of snow inN ovember frustrated his attempt 3). Though Goes in 1603 probably crossed during a more favourable season, we may fully concur with the narrative and call the passage 'difficult', and we can understand that the party, to brace itself for the effort, took a five days' rest at Par-wan 4). Then followed a journey of twenty days across the moun-1) Ricci, Commentarj, r. 532. -A.s regards the presence of iron near Charikar, the Imperial Gazetteer of India (X. 176) notes that large quantities of iron from the Ghar-band mines are carried to Charikar. 2) ].

As a matter of fact, this is one of the knotty points of the narrative, on which Ricci's manuscript throws no light. Errors are many. For instance: according to Ricci the journey from Attock to Peshawar took two months, a sheer impossibility, the distance being 70 kilometres. Yule, however, very acutely observes here (II, 538; Yule-Cordier IV, 181) that Goes' notes may have had 'II mensil' (from the Persian 'manzil', a day's march,) and that the Italian Ricci may have read 'II menses'. That Goes did note down distances in his diary appears from one of his letters, quot-ed by Du jarric (III, 205), in which he relates what befell him \"after travelling a dis-tance of I 02 cossas, a cossa being equal to an Italian mile.\" From a comparison of Ricci and Du Jarric the following dates are ascertained: departure from Lahore about the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"18 BENTO DE GOES tains to Aingaram, from where another fifteen days' march brought them to the district of Calcia. It is worth noticing that nearly a thousand years before the Buddhist pilgrim Hiuen-Tsang covered almost the same route in the same time. The name of Aingaram beyond the mountains cannot be traced 1), but for this we have some compensation in Goes' brief note on the people of Calcia. \"The people of this country are, like the Flemings, of a fair complexion. They inhabit several villages'' 1): another in-dication - and again the first - of a remnant, which in these secluded mountain regions has retained the original type and the primitive customs. The liberty-loving Calcia tribes, for they are clearly in question, live scattered throughout the tracts north of the Hindu Kush, and must be carefully distinguished from the Tadshiks of the plmns, whose character has been much affected by centuries of foreign domination. The Tadshiks, says Valikhanoff, are of a dark complexion, whilst among the Calcias fair-haired people are found 8). Ujfalvy, who made thorough studies of the many peoples of Central Asia, visited among others the Calcia.s of the Amu territory and met with many persons having blue eyes, and whose beards were brown, reddish or fair-coloured. They lived clt;)se together in villages and observed strict endogamy. The meaning of Calcia in their language was, so they said, 'a hungry raven forced to retire into the mountains in order to live' 4). The latest middle of February 1603 -arrival at Yarkand November 1603 according to Ricci, but in any case before February 1604, when Goes wrote to India from that town -departure from Yarkand mid-November 1604 -arrival at the Chinese wall towards the end of 1605 -death at Su-cheu April !.1, 1607. The computation of all the days of travel and of rest recorded in Ricci's account between Lahore and Kabul - some are evidently omitted - would place Goes' arrival at Yarkand in November 1604, just one year after the time he did arrive. Time-notices are consequently of no value as we shall have occasion to remark also in the sequel. 1) Wood's map glves near the Bamyan pass a place called Dara-i-Aingharan; this together with Ricci's chronology has led Yule to suppose that the caravan striking out westward from Parwan and skirting the Hindu Kush finally crossed by the Bamyan pass (Yule, 11,526; Yule-Cordier IV, 259). But this supposition is not supported by any evidence, least of all by Ricci's words (Commentaf'j, p. 532). Brucker (p. 604) finds on Wood's map a settlement I-angheram tK the P\"S.rwan valley, but again this cannot be the place in question, since according to the narrative Aingara\\m is situated beyond the mountains, and therefore north of them. In the supposition, the present jaram just north of the Parwan pass would be a more likely spot. 1) Ricci, Commentaf'j, p. 532: \"Barbae capelli ross!, come fiammenghi.\" •) Ratzel, Volkerkunde (Leipzig 1888) III, 455.

Skirting the higher uplands, so the narrative tells us, they reached Tenghi Badasci1m by a wretched road, and after a ten days' rest Ciarciu-nar. The district of Badakshan is evidently meant. In the town of the same name the escort made common cause with the populace and fell upon the traders. Goes notes here that 'Tenghi' means 'difficult road', and in fact, he says, the road was so narrow, that when travelling along the high bank of a large river they had to march in single file 1). Marco Polo had already complainedofthe bad roads in Badakshan, and if we take the above-mentioned river to be the Padsh or upper Amu-darja, the principal water-course of those regions, Goes' description agrees well with the find-ings of later travellers. Abdul Subhan, who took part in Forsyth's second expedition to Eastern Turkestan, describes the Padsh valley in the district of Gharan as very narrow and of difficult passage, where the deep and rapid river has cut itself a bed with almost perpendicular banks 2). Thus over slowly rising ground the cara-van gradually approached the formidable Pamirs, where the mightiest among the mountains of Central Asia, the huge ranges of the Tian Shan, Kuen Lun, Karakoram, Himalaya and Hindu Kush, meet and are crowned by the highest plateaux on the earth, the 'Roof of the World' as the natives call it. This 'roof', however, is no ordinary high plateau. Kostenko in 1875 and all more recent explorers describe it as a rather irregular succession of bare ridges and high-level valleys, which extend over immense distances Atkashes, a fair-haired, blue-eyed robber nation belonging to the Kafir tribes. They hold the eastern passes of the Hindu Kush, especially the road through the Chitral valley, which he considers to be the ancient trade route between India and China, already described by Ptolemy. He accordingly maps out a different route for Goes and makes him go JlP the Kunar river from Jelalabad and thence to the Hindu Kush through the Chitral valley. Against this Vivien de St. Martin has already objected that this route cannot be made to square with Goes' stay at Talikhan and his crossing of the Pamirs (L'An!Ue geographique 1869, p. 280). What, besides, would be the meaning of the jour-ney from Kabul to Charikar and Parwan, whose topographical situation is ascertained beyond doubt? It is, moreover, anything but certain that the ancient trade route did pass through the Chitral valley. Capus, who went down it in 1888, pronounces the road to be \"trffi difficile et peu fr6quentee.\" (Pamir et Tschitral -Bulletin de Ia So-ci6t6 de G6ographie (1890) .p. 500.) 1) Ricci, Commentarj, p. 534.

The snow-covered mountains which rise in every direction render, as Schultz one of the latest explorers remarks, the name of plateau, which is generally used, incorrect\"3). No European save Marco Polo had trod those forbidding regions before Goes, and the eighteenth century would close before Wood was to follow him. That Goes did cross the Pamir cannot be doubted. It is, indeed, denied by Alexander von Humboldt') and by Ritter 11}, the latter even going so far as to place Goes' route two degrees south of the Pamir track, but this error is easily explained. For Ricr.i does not mention the Pamir expressly, and in neither of the two German writers is there any indication that they know of any source for the reconstruction of Goes' journey beyond Trigault's translation of Ricci. Guerreiro and Du Jarric, however, have preserved a letter from Yarkand, in which the daring traveller tells of his experiences. \"While still at Hircanda [Yarkand] Bene-dictus de Goes wrote that he had had an exceedingly difficult and laborious journey through the Pamech desert. Of his horses five had perished through the intense cold and the entire lack of fuel together with the uncongenial state of the atmosphere, which made it almost impossible for the animals to breathe. Hence both men and beasts sometimes felt oppressed beyond endurance and gasped for breath. Against this evil men arm themselves by eating garlic, onions and dried apples, whilst thegumsoftheanimalsare rubbed with garlic.

The climate is bleak and severe in the extreme. Scarcely twoorthreeweeksof the summer are without a night-frost, and in the summer-nights Arved von Schultz often noted 7° C. of frost in the desert-like high valleys 2). No one escapes the effects of the mountain-sickness with its oppression of the lungs, bleedings and quickened pulse. Like Goes Bonvalot took as a precaution a supply of dried apples with him 3), and it is interesting to learn that the sultan of Pesha-war advised his friend Burnes on his journey through Central Asia t.o eat plenty of onions, this being the most efficacious means to get inured to the climate of those regions 4). Besides being a pasture ground for the wandering Kirghiz and their flocks, these inaccessible valleys have been, from time immemorial, a fav~urite resort for many whom political circumstances or crime had driven from their homes~ Pressed by necessity they form robber bands, against which Bonvalot and Capus in 1887 thought it well to provide arms 6). If we have undoubted evidence for Goes' journey across the 'Roof of the World', we are ignorant as regards the road he took. Whether he went by the greater or the lesser Pamir cannot be made out from the following scanty details of Ricci's narrative, and Du Jarric gives nothing beyond what has been quoted above.

Ten days later they arrived in Serpanil, a waste country, uninhabited and without food. Thence began the ascent of a steep mountain called Sacrithma, which only the strongest horses could climb, the others going by an easier but vety circuitous route\" 1). Serpanil may be traced back to Sir-i-Pamil, the 'Head of the Pamil', the native population, accordingtoFedschenko, using Pamil for Pamir2). But what and where is the Sacrithma? Can the name, which has probably been sadly maimed, have any connection with the mountain station of Sarikbaee near the sources of the Amu-darja, as Yule suggests? 3) Or may it be a local name for some portion of the N esa Tagh? It is certain that Goes had had to cross that range. \"At last,\" Ricci continues, \"after twenty days' march they arrived in the province of Sarcol [Sarikol or Sirikol], where they found several villages built close together. Two days were allowed for rest on account of the jaded horses, and after an-other two days they found themselves at the foot of the Ciecialith.

Under the leadership of Gordon a party belonging to For-syth's expedition travelled along the same route in 1874 '),as did also Aurel Stein in 1906 on his journey to Eastern Turkestan 11). The latter crossed the Tagh-Dumbash Pamir and reached Sarikol by the Wakhjir pass. Sarikol is a small mountain district, in which a number of villages with a fairly thick population spread them-selves along the Tashkurgan. By the Ciecialith is meant the high pass of Chichiklik (4350 metres), which was also followed by Stein but under far better conditions. ','At length Tanghetar [Tangitar] was reached, where Isaac fell from the high bank of the river into the water but was fortunately rescued\". The Tangitar river comes from the Chichiklik plateau and unites with the Sarikol to pour their joint waters into the Serafchan or river of Y arkand.

Yule is at a loss how to identify this place. Very likely it is Yakka-arik, which would furnish another proof for the unreliability of Ricci's time-notices; for he requires five days for the next stage, Yakk~-arik-Yarkand, which is only twenty kilometers. Here Goes left the spent caravan and hurried oii to Hiarcan [Yarkand], whence he sent fresh horses and supplies to those he had left be-hind. Finally the whole party entered Y arkand, then the capital of the kingdom of Kashgar. It was probably November 1603 1). Of old the oasis of Yarkand, with its congested centre and roomy outskirts, had been, and it still is, one ofthegreatstopping-places and emporiums on the long trade route between China and the distant West. Goes is very sparing in his details about this much frequented centre, only mentioning the great number of Mohammedan temples and a curious ceremony in the observance of the Friday as the Mohammedan weeklydayofrest. On that day all believers assembled in the great mosque. As soon as the service was over, twelve men carrying leather thongs or scourges left the temple and went about striking all those who had not been present -a proceeding intended to obtain them pardon for their n~glect 2). It need hardly be said that in such a place a Christian's very life .was in danger, though, indeed, it was not the first time that fanatical Mohammedans attempted Goes' life. Even before he had left India, probably when still at Kashmir, one of the rajahs threatened to have the unbeliever crushed under the feet of his elephants, but the stranger's calm reply that he would gladly lay down his life for the true God disarmed his enemy. Others, sword in hand, tried to compel him to call on Mohammed but likewise failed, and at last the intrepid traveller found friends even among the enemies of his religion, who, respecting such courage, were ready to defend him when in danger. At Yarkand soon the rumour spread that a foreigner, aEuropean,notafollowerof Mohammed, had arrived in the town. Such a thing was unthinkable, for was not everybody persuaded that no man in his senses could fail to ') Very cautiously Ricci writes: \"Pare cbe questa arrivata fu l'istesso anno di 1603 in novembre.\" (Commentarj, p. 536). Du Jarric (Ill, 206) simply writes \"November\".

Some presents, among them a watch, one large and three smaller looking-glasses, but especially Goes' tactful behaviour so gratified the king that he had him sent for several times and even invited him to explain the Christian religion in the presence of his court, which gave rise to many a sharp dispute with the mollahs. For about a year the explorer had his patience tried at Yarkand. The caravan of the Kabul traders had been disbanded, and the formation of a fresh party was attended with peGUliar difficulties. The right of organizing and leading a caravan was sold by the king of Kashgar to the highest bidder, whom he appointed his ambassador investing him with absolute authority over his fellow-travellers. Then in consideration of large sums of money and presents the leader associated with himself four others with the title of ambassadors, after which he enrolled a suite of 72 travellers, who likewise had to buy their admission. Thus a caravan to Ga-thav put on the appearance of an embassy and it was only under this guise that it could penetrate into that country 2). Ricci speaks at length of this peculiar form of commercial inter-course. \"Most merchants coming to this town [Su-cheu, the gate of China for caravans from Turkestan] arrive from the west pre-tending to be ambassadors. Byveryancienttreatiessevenoreight countries have obtained from the Chinese government that every five years seventy-two persons in the quality of ambassadors shall bring tribute to the king, which must consist of the well-known transparent marble [jade or nephrite], diamonds, blue pigments and similar articles. This is carried to the court at the expense of the state, which also furnishes funds for the return journey. This tribute is more honourable than profitable, for no one obtains marble at greater cost than the king, who considers it incom-patible with his dignity to accept anything from foreigners for nothing.

Hence it is that such an embassy is much sought after and membership is bought with presents from the leader, with whom theappointm~ntrests. When the day of departure draws near they forge royal letters patent, in which they pay respectful homage to the Chinese sovereign. From several countries such embassies are admitted into the country, fromCaucincinum[Cochin-China],Sian[Siam],Lenchien[Riu-Kiu Islands], Corianum [Korea] and fr.om some petty Tartar princes. All this is an immense burden on the treasury, but the Chinese, who are well aware of the fraud, want by such devices to flatter their sovereign and make him believe that the whole world pays tribute to China, while it is the Chinese themselves who thus pay tribute to those countries\" 1). The two Jesuits Martin Martini and Alvaro Semedo speak in like terms of those pseudo-ambassadors. According to the latter the presents for the emperor always con-sisted of 1 ,000 arobas or 1 ,333 Italian pounds of nephrite, 340 horses, 300 very small diamonds, about 100 pounds of fine blue pigment, 600 knives, 600 files, of a total value of 7,000 crowns. The emperor's acknowledgment was worth 50,000 crowns. Xavier's Mohammedan informant at Lahore declared that he himself had penetrated into the country as a merchant-ambassador of the king of Kashgar 3). As the negotiations for the formation of the travelling-party dragged on, Goes was at leisure to visit Cotan (Khotan), situated in the oasis of the same name so~th-east of Yarkand. That he should direct his steps thither finds its explanation in an event that had taken place in the early part of his journey at Kabul. During his stay there the mother of the king of Khotan, who was also the sister of the king of Kashgar, returned to that town from a pilgrimage to Mecca.

Very likely her rank had been no safe-guard against the rapacity of the hillmen, for she was soon short of money and turned to the merchants for aid promising to refund all on their arrival at Yarkand. This was too favourable an opportunity to secure protection on his further journey for Goes to let it pass unused. He sold part of his merchandise, and the proceeds, 600 gold pieces, were advanced to the princess free of charge. Of special importance was the stipulation that the whole sum was to be paid back in transparent marble, the stone mentioned above as forming part of the tribute carried by the ambassadors. This jade, the Yu-stone of the Chinese, the jaspis of the ancients, called nephrite by our mineralogists, has always been and still is highly valued throughout the East, especially among the Chinese, who ascribe to it certain properties. With this stone their philosophers connect the five virtues that form the basis of the Chinese moral code: Modesty, mercy, justice, meekness and frankness 2). Every Chinese woman, writes Von Schmidt, wears nephrite ornaments of some sort, generally bracelets. Both men and women wear one as ~amulet against sickness 3). Nephrite has found its way even in+o Europe, and traces of it have been discovered even in the so-called prehistoric dwelling-places. As late as 1865 Damour wrote that such articles were kept in France as a protection against certain diseases, or were enclosed in the foundations of many houses to prevent their being struck by lightning 4). For a long time there was complete ignorance as to the place where this stone, which does not occur in Europe, was found; the only thing known was that it came to the Chinese from the west. After Marco Polo, who passed through those regions between 1271 and 1275, Goes was the first European to visit the principal place of origin. It is the presence of nephrite that has given Khotan its fame through-out the East. Fortunately, on this point the narrative is fuller than it is wont to be, and Trigault has added some details from his own store of knowledge. \"There is no article in which a more 1) Du Jarric, (III, 211) writes, \"Ahehaxam, id est lingua Turcica, venustas Mecha descend ens.\" 1) K.

This marble, of which at present the country is full, is called Yusce by the Chinese. There are two kinds. The most valuable stone is obtained from the river Co tan [Khotan-darja] not far from the capi-tal [Khotan] in· nearly the same manner as divers fish for pearls. It is generally brought up in the shape of large pebbles. The other less valuable kind is got from the mountains and cut out in large slabs about two yards broad, after which it is made fit for trans-port. These mountains are at 20 days' journey from the capital and are called Can Sanguicascio, that is rock of stone [Kan-sang-i-Kash, the mine of Kash stone]. It costs an incredible amount of labour to loosen those pieces both on account of the remoteness of the spot and the hardness of the marble. It is said that this hard-ness may sometimes be slightly reduced by making a hot fire on the surface of the stone.

Such trenches are to be seen in ever direction; they are generally only a couple of metres deep and wide, whilst their length is ten metres at the utmost, their shape being as a rule rectangular. It is only among the stones from the mountain that pieces of nephrite are found, which of course are water-worn, The spots for such trenches are selected at hazard, and sometimes it will be months before any piece of value is met with. White pieces with yellow spots, called gusch, that is flesh, have the greatest value. In the town of Khotan are a couple of factories for the production of small nephrite articles such as snuff-boxes, mouth-pieces for pipes, bracelets etc.\" 1) The stone is, of course, also mentioned by Stein in his archaeological exploration of the Khotan territory, the kind referred to being of a sort of green colour, of inferior quality, quarried from a mountain side high up in the valley of the Kara-Kash. He adds: \"The manner in which this inferior jade is obtained was correctly related by Goes, who speaks of the place as Cansanghicascio\" 2). Meanwhile this little excursion of Goes' was causing days of anxiety to Isaac, :who had stayed behind at Yarkand, and to De-metrius, who had arrived five months later than his former master. Though according to Goes' own assurance Khotan lay at only ten days' distance, he liad been absent for a month. The Mohammedans adroitly turned this prolonged absence to account and spread the rumour that the unbeliever for being unwilling to call upon the name of Mohammed had been put to death by their priests, and they began to cast covetous glances at his belongings as unclaimed property. Fortunately at this junction the faithful Armenian saw his master, for whom he was already mourning, return safe and sound carrying a good supply of nephrite with him 3). In the meantime a certain Agi-Afis had been appointed head of the caravan and the intrepid European was invited to join the embassy.

He then accepted the honourable offer on condition that he should have safe-conducts given him for the whole of the rest of the journey. His old Kabul companions still tried to retain him, but at last November 14, 1604, he was at liberty to venture deeper into the deserts of Asia 1). Dozens of tr.avellers have in the course of the nineteenth century followed him into those lonely regions of the Tarim basin, Russians and Englishmen have opened up the country, but to no one more than to the famous Swedish explorer Sven Hedin are we indebted for the increase of our knowledge of those territories. His perilous journeys enable us to form a picture of what difficulties had to be encountered by his daring predecessor. Eastern Turkestan or the Tarim basin is but a link in the im-mense chain of deserts reaching right across the Old World from the north-west coast of Africa to the steep slopes of the Chingan mountains. All round the arid sands of the Takla-Makan rise the fantastic summits of endless mountain ranges like the unscalable walls of a gigantic prison leaving a free horizon only towards the east, where the eye loses itself in the lifeless wastes of Lob-nor, behind which lies the great sea of sand, the Gobi or Shamo. Even in the very earliest periods of history it was through Turkestan that China and the West were in touch with each other. At the begin-ning of our era the famous silk-route lay partly within its borders and the excavations of Sven Hedin, Sir Aurel Stein and many others in the sand-buried towns plainly testify to the importanceof that country in former times 2).

Goes took the northern road travelling by the oasis-towns of Aksu, Kutsha, Kurla, Turfan and Chami, from which latter place he cut across the desert into China. All these larger places are mentioned in the narrative together with a host of smaller ones, which, however, cannot be located with certainty even with the aid afforded by the detailed maps of Hedin, Stein and others. This should not sur-prise us for several reasons. The greater part of the journal being lost many names had to be written down by Ricci, an Italian, from the dictation of Isaac, a Persian-speaking Armenian, who had only his memory to rely upon; how much distortion such process must have entailed no one can tell. Others may have been of mere local use-a supposition which in a couple of cases comes ve.._ry near to certainty, while it is not at all impossible that in a country so m.uch ravaged by sand-storms and plundering bands many a halting-place may have been swept out of existence since the time of Goes. As early as the eighteenth century, when preparing their famous map of China, the Jesuits found it impossible to locate many places spoken of in the narrative. Father Regis thinks the difficulty was owing to the peculiarity of several towns having more than one name, the one employed by Goes having probably fallen into desuetude 1). \"After leaving Yarkand,\" the narrative continues, \"the first stopping-place was Jolci, where generally a toll was paid and the royal letters of exemption were inspected.

Egriar= Egri-iar; this is a frequently occurring local name. as is stated by Dr. Sven Hedin in a letter to the writer on the subject of these names. Meselelec= Mejnet, or according to Hedin, Merket-daylik. Tallec=Tallik (Hedin), a name much used in those parts. Horma; this word means 'date' in modem Persian; it may be objected that no date-trees are to be found in those parts (Hedin). According to Pelliot it is the Hu-eul-man of Chinese texts of the 18th century (Cf. Yule-Cordier, IV, 228). Toantac=Tewan-tAgh, the 'low hill'; it is to this day the name of a hilly spur to the east of the road Maralbashi-Aksu (Yule-Cordier, IV, 228). Capetalcol=Chaptal-kul?

Taking the latter supposition Yule proposes to read Saregabedal; Brucker taking the former reads Sarc, a contraction of Sai-arik, whilst Guebedal remains unknown. According to Hassenstein (Hedin, Er-gebnisse, p. 364) Sai or Saj ml'ans a dry stony river-bed or a stony plain at the foot of a mountain. Cambasci= Kumbasch, on Hedin's map south of Aksu. Kam baschi means 'the first quarries'. Aconterzec= Saksak? (Yule). Ciacor=Shakyar? (Yule). Hedin also remarks that there is a frequent altering of names along the Yarkand-darja and the Tarim on account of the shifting of the river-beds.

From Maralbashi the track runs along the edge of an arid steppe, in which oases are but rare. Speaking of the desert Goes notes that it is called Cara Catai, \"which means black country of the Cathayans, because it is main-tained that the inhabitants of Cathay occupied it for a long time\". Roebroek also uses the name of Cara-Cathay, 'Black Cathay', to distinguish it, he says, from the country of the Cathayans, who inhabit the sea-board in the far East. But the 'Blacks' live among the mountains 1). If Roebroek undoubtedly refers to the Tian Shan mountains, it is equally clear that Goes applies the name to the desert at their southern base. Now it appears from Chinese histo-rians that for centuries the Chinese occupied the Gobi desert and the Tarim basin, but the inroads of the Tibetans in the eighth century put an end to the Cathay rule and at the same time to the prosperity of the country. The same supremacy of China appears moreover from the numerous archaeological finds spoken of above. Even in China Ch. E. Bonin discovered the remains of an ancient traw·lling-road going in the direction of the desert, defended at certain intervals by towers linked up by earthen walls. The road ran along the southern face of the wall probably to protect it from the desert sands swept up from the north 2). Stein, too, discovered and followed over a distance of 225 kilometres an old Chinese wall, running from Aksu westward, with towers at every three to five kilometres. The road alongside of it was he says being used as early as the second century B. c. 3). The king at Aksu was a twelve-year-old boy, cousin to the king of Kashgar. Being well-disposed through some presents suitable to his age, sugar and the like, he received the traveller kindly. He had·a festive dance performed in the presence of Goes, whom he then requested to dance after the fashion of his country, which 1) Yule, I, 176. -Plano Carpini translates the name of the people as 'Nigri Ki-tai.' The Chinese monk Ch'ang-ch'ung, who from 1221-1224 travelled through Cen-tral Asia to the Hindu Kush, also speaks of a country where the Karakitai live. With him, however, it is a country west of Kulcha, at the northern base of the Tian Shan in Russian Turkestan. (Dr. E. Bretschneider, Chinesische Reismde des Mittelalters nach West-Asien, Peterm.

After a few more visits io the king's mother and to his tutor, with the indispensable accom• paniment of presents, and a compulsory rest of fifteen days to allow the stragglers to come up with them, Goes set out once more. By way of Oitograc, Gaso, Casciani, Dellai, Saregabedal and Ugan, across a great many mountain streams and in part over the spurs of the Tian Shan the caravan arrived at the small town of Cucia (Kutsha or Kuchar) 1). In this oasis, according to Merzbacher in many respects the most pleasant of all the towns in the Tarim basin, they took a whole month's rest, of which they stood greatly in need, for \"the· difficult journey, the heavy load of marble and the want of food had exhausted every one's strength\". The fanatical vexa-tions Goes had to suffer at the hands of the Mohammedan priests of this town made him,no doubt, welcome the momenta£ departure. Twenty-five days later he was at Cialis, \"a small but well-forti-fied town .. \" Opinions vary as regards the identity of this place, which, under this name at least, does not occur on the maps. That it is situated on the main caravan-route there can be no doubt. Ritter supposes it is Yuldus among the Tian Shan mountains 1); Yule takes it to be Karashar 8), since this town, which by all travellers is numbered among the principal towns along the route, is not mentioned by Goes at all; Brucker on the authority of Gaubil votes for Korla 4). De Vasconcellos 6} also mentions the latter place, but, without assigning any reason, prefers Chiglik, a settlement some forty-six kilometres south of Korla, from where PrzewalSky approached the Lob-nor in 1876. This hamlet, however, is too far 1) Casciani and Saregabedal are probably to be identified with the places called l'schaktschi and Sairam respectively on Hedin's maps. Oitograc again is a local·name. Regel, in his account of his expedition to Turfan, speaks of the 'tugrak', the desert,. pop· lar, one of the trees most congenial to the waterless steppes, so that Oitograc would mean a place abounding in poplars. A. Regel, Meine E:rpedition nach Turfan z8'79 -Peterm. Mitteil. (1879 p. 382). Hedin and Stein frequently speak of the tograks. Here again Pelliot has his own way of accounting for the impossibility to identify these places. \"Goes\", he writes, \"did not go to Kuchar by the present road of Bai and Sairam. The plain of Bai is closed to the south by a mountain range not mentioned on the maps, the Chol-tagh or 'barren mountains'. Up to the first half 6f the nine· teenth century caravans going from Aksu to Kuchar took the route south of Chol-tagh, and it was this road which was followed by Goes.\" (quoted from Yule-Cordier IV, 23l.} 1) Ritter, I, 222. 1) Yule, II, 575; Yule-Cordier, IV, 234.

Korla seems to be the most likely place both on account of Goes' remark that the town was strongly fortified and of its situation. \"Korla\", says Hedin, \"is a small town, whose only point of importance is jts geographical position on the river [the Kontje-darja], at the entrance of a narrow pass between the Tian Shan and the Kurruk Tag, and on the .great caravan-road between Aksu and Kara-shahr\"1). Even to-day Korla is a fortress with a Chinese garrison. At Cialis the reception by the Mohammedan sovereign, another relation to the king of Kashgar, threatened to be somewhat unfavourable, but in the end the pass-ports and the necessary presents did not fail of their effect. Here also Goes could not avoid argument. One night when the king and several of his priests were discussing religious topics, the stranger was suddenly sent for. Goes went, though somewhat surprised at this nocturnal invitation, which to the anxious Isaac foreboded nothing but evil. The priests at once opened the attack, but after a hot controversy were reduced to silence, the sovereign winding u;> the debate with the remarkable declaration that the Christians, too, were true believers, followers of a religion which at one time had been professed by their forefathers 2),-a vague remi-niscence of the Nestorian Christian communities, which, like the settlements buried under the desert sands, have vanished without leaving a trace. As the leader of the caravan wanted to enroll fresh associates, Goes' patience was tried for another three months, till at length he obtained the king's special leave to start by himself, which, how-ever, alienated from him the rest of the caravan. Whenhewason the point of leaving the town, there arrived a large party from Cathay, who supplied him with the most valuable information. In 1601 these merchants had penetrated into the capital in the quality of ambassadors, they had even lived there for three months together with Ricci and his companions. Though unable to giv~ their European names, each of the foreigners. having assumed another name after the Chinese fashion, they could sufficiently describe their appearance, enumerate the presents offered by them to the emperor, and even, in support of their assertions, produce a piece of paper with Portuguese words written by the foreigners at 1) Hedin, Ergebnisse, p. 66. 1) Ricci, Commentari, p. 545."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"36 BENTO DE GOES Pekin. They had picked it up from the sweepings of Ricci's room, that on their return home they might prove that the people using that language had penetrated into China 1). All this could not but convince Goes that Cathay differed from China only in name, and thatCambalucwasindeed thecapitalcity, was Pekin. Consequently what Ricci had written before his departure from Lahore was true, and he, Goes, had proved it to be so. With Isaac and a small party he now travelled by Puccian (Pit-shang or Pichan) to the fortified town of Turfan, whence after another month's delay he reached the fortress of Camul (Chami) bywayofAramuth (?). At this point there is a slip in the narrative. Pitshang is not to the west but to the east of Turfan. The road to this oasis, passing by Karashar along the northern shore of the Bagratsh-kul, runs through an easy longitudinal valley. The German botanist A. Regel, in the employ of the Russian government, penetrated into this fertile country in 1878, though not without difficulty. He learned from the inhabitants that the present town only dated from about 150 years back, so that Goes must have stayed at t3e old town, the ruins of which lie a litle more eastward 2).

This was in 1756 when D'Espinha by order of the emperor Khien-long followed the army into Dzungaria in the character of topographer; on that occasion he determined the situation of Turfan and Korla 3).

The object of his journey had almost been achie-ved; there remained but a march across the desert, and 500 kilo-metres beyond the undulating sands of the Gobi, at whose nor-them edge he stood, rose the great Chinese wall. The shortest route is from Chami by Ansifan to Su-cheu, which was followed byGrum Grschimailo and Obrutschew in 1889 and 1894. Futterer, one of the latest explorers, assures that \"this route puts no hindrances in the way save those arising from a wintry climate, drought, heat and possible sandstorms. There are no lofty mountains raising the track through difficult passes, only a few undulating rises of the ground about the middle part of the road\" 1). For all this the jour-ney is not without its perils, as appears both from what Du Halde relates on this point as far back as 1736, and from what Kreitner reports of Mandl, who in 1881 found this road strewn with the carcases of anima1s that had died from lack of water or food 2). Goes, so the narrative goes on to say, reached the northern Chinese wall near the town of Chiaicuon (Chia-yu-kuan or the 'Jade Gate', of the Great Wall) nine days after leaving Chami, and, after waiting for twenty-five days for the permission of the viceroy of Kan-su to proceed on his journey, he arrived in one day's march at Socceo (Su-cheu), surely a record journey if the number of days given be correct. These calculations, however, though probable enough in normal circumstances, seem hardly admissible in the present instance. For though the road may not be exceptionally difficult, it is never easy and was at the time anything but safe. \"The country between Cialis and the Chinese wall,\" Goes writes, \"is notorious for its Tartar raids, so that traders always cross it in the greatest fear, sometimes even under cover of night and in the strictest silence. One often comes across the dead bodies of Mohammedans who have attempted the journey unaccompanied, though on the other hand the Tartars are not wont to kill the native population, considering them as their servants and herds-men whom they occasionally rob of their flocks.\" 3).

At Su-cheu, where Goes arrived towards Christmas 1605, he again met with Mohammedans on their home-journey from P.ekin, who again assured him of the presence of European priests. The first thing now was to inform Ricci. Through letters from India the latter knew of the expedition, and firm in his conviction he had as late as November 12, 1605, once more written to the Supe-rior of the mission of Goa to prove the identity of Cathay and China 2). Of course every new arrival in the capital was questioned about our traveller but without any result. Nor did the first let-ter, despatched by Goes from Su-cheu immediately on his arrival, reach Ricci, because Goes did not know his Chinese name, and had, moreover, writt~n the address in European characters. At last in the middle ofN ovember 1606 a Mohammedan handed Ricci a letter, which had been despatched at Easter 8). In it Goes gave an account of his journey, spoke of it plainly as being very dangerous, and useless for commercial purposes. Now here had he found any trace of Christians and he presse<i Ricci to take instant measures to enable him to get to the capital. It was his intention to return to India by way of Canton. Though the approaching winter was anything but favourable for the four months' journey from Pekin to Su-cheu, Ricci on December II despatched one of his trusted pupils, Fernandes, who spoke Portuguese. Little did Fernandes suspect, as he neared the town at the end of March 1607, that he came but to assist a dying man. What had happened to Goes? Su-cheu was in reality two towns, one Chinese the other Moham-medan, and it was in the latter that Goes, a ·foreigner, had to take up his residence. Six months after his arrival his former travelling-companions, against whose will he had started from Cialis, entered the town, which may not have improved the situ~tion.

His eyes full of tears he opened the letter from Pekin and read and re-read that last con-firmation of all his toilsome travels. Cathay was China! . . . .

When looking back on his own stay at Su-cheu Sir Aurel Stein recalls in a few words of warm sympathy the m~mory of the great traveller who preceded him by some 300 years. \"I had thought of him and his plucky perseverance at all the points-Lahore, Pesha-war, the Pamirs, Sarikol, Yarkand and Khotan-where I had touched the line of his wanderings .... there is nothing to suggest even approximately the spot where his wearied limbs were laid to rest by the young Chinese convert, whom the Jesuit Fathers had despatched from Peking to his relief, and who arrived just a few days before aU earthly trouble was ended\" 2).

But the same journal had recorded in its pages the sums of money advanced by Cn>es to several of his .fellow-travellers.

But the hatred of the Moham-medans was not yet satisfied and Goes' faithful servant was not to escape scot-free. Isaac was thrown into prison and his case dragged on for months. Fernandes stood by him faithfully, which at first was extremely difficult, as he did not understand Persian. But with great diligence he learned it from Isaac at night-time, a.Jld was then able to undertake his defence. Though right was on iheir side, they were no match for the rich merchants, who had no diffi-culty in corrupting the Chinese judges. Yet, after five months, their persistance prevailed, and what was left of Goes' possessions was assigned to them. This they carried with respectful care to Ricci, and by their oral communications helped him to compose the narrative of the journey 1). After taking a month's rest at Pekin Isaac, well rewarded, returned to his wife and family in India. His adventures·, however, were not yet ended.

But however much one may appreciate the merits of these intrepid ex~ plorers and of those who followed them, one cannot but regret the om~ssion in their accounts of any mention of the laborious journeys of their predecessors. Yet there were men among them who, though but pioneers, not scientific explorers, may lay claim to undeniable merits in the vast field of the history of discovery. Such a one is the Portuguese Jesuit Antonio de Andrade, who nearly 300 years ago was the first European to climb those stupendous mountain walls, to discover one of the principal sources of the sacred Ganges, and, starting from Hindostan, to penetrate into the unknown regions of Tibet. This neglect is the more to be regretted, since in the case of Andrade, if writers on the subject do make passing mention of his travels, their accounts are generally incorrect. An immediate illus-tration of thisinaccuracyisafforded bythefollowingquotationfrom Clements Markham's book on Bogle and Manning. After relating how Andrade set out !or the Himalaya mountains he continues: \"He climbed the terrific passes to the source of the Ganges and eventually after fearful sufferings reached the shores of the sacred lake of Mansarowar, the source of the Sutlej. Thence the undaunted missionary found his way over the lofty passes to Rudok and even-tually by way of Tangut to China\" 2). These words, however com-1) Burrard, Preface, p.

I shall indicate later a possible source of this error. Unfortunately, these erroneous statements have been copied and repeated, they have been commented on at the cost of the character of the traveller, till misstatement has gone so far that Sir Thomas Holdich has felt justified in pronouncing the following verdict on Andrade. \"The story of his travels as we possess it at present is unsatisfactory in many particulars. The letters written in 1626 to his Superior, the Jesuit General.Mutio Vitelleschi, give but scanty and confused details of a journey which apparently terminated at Tsaparang on the river Sutlej. It is difficult to reconcile the account of his explorations beyond the Manasarawar lake to Rudok, and thence to Cathay and back, either with the topography of the Tibetan highlands or with the exigencies of time that would be required for such a journey. In spite of his hitherto prominent position in the field of Asiatic geography, Antonio de Andrade must be regarded as but a doubtful authority\" 1). Simi-larly Graham Sandb'erg, after stating that there exist two letters of Andrade of the years 1624 and 1626 respectively, continues: \"The letters in question contain the most meagre details of the writer's travels, but a considerable display of information con-cerning the people and religion of the country he professed to have discovered. The scanty yet confused account of his journey, to-gether with the absurd inapplicability of his e~position of their manners and beliefs to the Tibetans as we now know them, might excuse one for pronouncing the whole story of Andrade's visit to the country to be a fraud. How far the published effusions were the actual composition of their hero and how much was the invention of the home authorities cannot at all be determined. There is, however, beneath the bungling account printed and the manifest attempt to exaggerate the importance of the achievement, a cer-tain substratum of correctness in two or three topographical points, which makes it extremely unlikely that the whole exploit was a fiction 2).\" 1) Holdich, p. 70. The letter (not letters) referred to was written in 1624, published in 1626. 1) Sandberg, Exploration, p. 24.

As matters stand, an inquiry is absolutely demanded. So this chapter is not only intended to give a general outline of Andrade's expedition, thus reviving the memory of the traveller, but to show the genuineness and reliability of his work. This will necessitate frequent reference to the findings of later travellers 3).

May not this same title have led some to suppose that Andrade had extended his explorations as far as China? 1) Few biographical details of Antonio de Andrade have been pre-served. He was born in 1580 at Oleiros, a small country town in the Portuguese province of Beira Baixa 2), and entered the Society of Jesus December 15, 1596. Four years later he was sent to India, where he finished his studies. After being engaged in mis-sionary work at Salsette and governing the colleges of Rachal and of St. Paul at Goa he had the government of all the mission sta-tions in the territory of the Great Mogul entrusted to him. He had discharged this office for three years when he began his work of exploration. Andrade briefly relates the occasion of his journey. It is the same which led to Goes' expedition. More than twenty years be-fore the missionaries had heard of Christians supposed to be living in Tibet 3), and reports to a similar effect had persistently come in, 1) An extensive bibliography is given by Sommervogel, I, 329-331, Appendix p. VI; also VIII, 1639; as the first translation he cites the Spanish one published at Madrid in 1627; it was made the basis of the others, viz. of the French translations of Ghent 1627, of Paris 1627, of Pont-a-Mousson 1628; of the Italian of Rome 1627, of Naples 1627, of Venice 1646; of the German of Augsburg 1627 in two editions. A Dutch translation undated appeared certainly before 1635. Besides these, mentioned by Sommervogel, I have been fortunate to discover a Spanish translation from the same hand that edited the original, published at Lisbon in 1626. This then is the oldest translation. Extracts of varying length are given by various authors, for example by Franco, Imagem, pp. 376-418, almost literally, and by Cordara, p. 524-526, n. 171-179. For the convenience of the reader all references relate to the first Lisbon edition of 1626, which as stated above is an accurate reproduction of the MS. 1) This is stated by the best authorities: Franco, p. 375; Machado, I, 202; J.

Sommervogel, I, 329 is certainly wrong in speaking of Oleiros in Alemtejo, as is also Denis, I, 546. From the above it will also be clear that Denis is wrong in saying that \"l'ouvrage fut reproduit par le P. Antonio Franco, puis traduit en diverses langues.\" 1) Andrade, p. 2. Hay, p. 796.

What was more natural than a desire to ascertain the truth of these reports on the spot? Quite unexpectedly a favour-able opportunity presented itself. On March 30, 1624, Andrade to-gether.with Brother Manuel Marques had left Agra to follow the Emperor on his journey to Kashmir. Arriving at Delhi he learned that a large party of Hindus were about to start on a pelgrimage to a famous temple in the Himalaya mountains at a distance of about two and a half months' journey from Agra. Here was an opportunity. These pilgrims might serve for protection and guid-ance in the first part of the journey meditated. No time was lost in taking the measures necessary for the government of the mis-sion and making some preparation for the expedition; then, on the morning fixed for the departure, Andrade, his companion and two servants joined the caravan. A Hindu disguise, in which even the Delhi Christians failed to recognise him, was to see him through the first difficulties. Travelling by the shortest route, probably through the valley of the Ganges by Hard war, 'the Gate of Vishnu', the principal shrine of those northern parts, the caravan reached in fifteen days the borders of Hindustan, where at the foot of the mountains began the territory of the rajah of Srinagar, in what is now Kumaon, one of the divisions of theN. W. Provinces. Even at this early stage the expedition threatened to come to nothing. It had soon become evident to the pilgrims that the small band that had joined them, were neither believers nor traders They were in consequence arrested as spies, but in default of evidence they were fortunately set free early enough to allow them to continue their jour11ey with the rest of the caravan. th~ Himalaya mountains. I quote his words the more willingly as they contain the very first mention of Mansarowar lake. \"At vera, in interior!

Before them rose the Himalaya mountains, the 'Snowy Range', which must be crossed by those who from the tropical splendour of India venture into the chill solitudes ofthe high plateau of Tibet. As yet no European had set foot among these huge fastnesses that reach from the gateway of the Ganges to the gateway of the Brahmaputra. The ascent of the first mountains, so the narrative continues, was extremely difficult, ridge rose behind ridge and the paths were so narrow that they could only advance by inches, clinging to the wall of rock; while deep down below the sacred Ganges seethed and foamed, hurrying rapidly through its narrow gorge-like bed. To cheer and encourage each other the Hindus never ceased calling out the name of their pagoda with the never ending and monotonous refrain of \"Ye, Badrinate, ye, ye.\" At every favourable point along the route stood small temples, jewels of architecture, where some jogis, the well-known fanatical Hindu self-torturers, guarded the divinity worshipped there 1). The sce-nery was splendid. The lower uplands were covered with primeval forests, gigantic pine-trees \"two or three times the height of the church-tower of Goa,\" numbers of cinnamon-trees, cypres~s. lemon and chest:J;mt trees ,and flowers without number, while moun-tain streams leapt down all around them. At last they reached the town of Srinagar, .the residence of the rajah 2). \"The name of the capital of Kashmir, Srinagar, is identical with that of the capital of Garhwal, which accounts for the fact that several writers make Andrade travel through Kashmir8). But not 1) In passing Andrade relates an event which shows how little the Mogul sovereigris shared the superstitious reverence of the Hindus for these self-torturers. One day when the Emperor was out hunting in Kashmir near one of the sacred lakes, he saw a jogi who had a very uncouth appearance. The hair of the naked man was more than four cubits and his nails more than a palm in length. A crowd of people thronged about the. saint and worshipped his feet. The jogi took no notice whatever of the Emperor. On his return from the hunt the latter summoned the jogi who refused to go, unless they carried him or fetched him in the royal coach. Incensed at this answer the Emperor had the man dragged by the hair into his presence and gave orders that in punishment his hair and nails should be cut and himself made a show of along the roads. 1) Andrade, p. 4. 1) Thus Hue, Chl-istianisme, 11,279;Max Miillbauer, Geschichtetler Katholischen Mis-sionen in Ostintlien (Freiburg in Breisgau 1852) p. 283; Aug.

Srinagar itself is situated on the left bank and at the time of Andrade's arrival was as yet a new town having been founded in the early years of the seven-teenth century. It was destroyed by floods in 18941). J. Muir gives a graphic description of the yawning river-bed of the Alaknanda, which squares with the Portuguese account on every point. \"The river, which is of a sea-green colour. flows at a great distance below the road, the grassy mountains, which are in some parts bare of trees, in others sprinkled with pines, sloping down steeply to its edge. The dell is narrow at the bottom and the stream is in one place so closely confined by cliffs on either hand that it looks like a canal hewn out of the mountain, the rocky banks rising square ana sharp above it. In other parts the steep overhanging banks, as seen from above, are finely fringed with trees. In one place the road forms !or a short way a staircase leading up the mountains, with a wall of rock rising up on the one hand, while a steep slope (which is as nearly as possible a precipice) of a thousand feet deep sinks down on the other 2).\" Very briefly Andrade brings out at this point the difference between the mountain people and the Hindus of the plains. At Srina-gar the }Velcome was not of the kindest, and again he had to undergo a severe cross-examination as to whence he came and what was his object. Having no merchandise with him he could not pos-sibly put himself forward as a trader, so he acknowledged frankly that he was going to Tibet for the purpose of exploration. Whether this answer was deemed satisfactory or whether the rajah had: al-ready made up his mind to stop all further advance when the stranger should have arrived at the furthest frontier of his terri-tory, anyhow, after five or six days the traveller was released with loss of several articles which the officials had simply appropriated.

The village is 2,300 metres above sea-level. Along the banks of the wild-rushing Vishnu-Ganga, a veritable penance-road, the pilgrims ascended into ever higher regions. At a stroke Andrade paints this perilous journey through the upper mountains. \"Not as hitherto by difficult rope-bridges, but over bridges formed by frozen masses of snow, which fill up the whole width of the river and underneath which the river-water breaks itself a foaming passage, we had to cross and recross the Ganges [Vishnu-Ganga], to reach at length after a journey of a month and a half the pagoda of Badrid [Badrinath] on the frontier of Scrina-gar 1).\" It was towards the end of May or at the beginning of June 1624, as may with some probability be conjectured from Andra-de's writing a letter on May 16, 1624, \"at five days' journey from Scrinagar on the way to Bardinara [Badrinath) 2).\" More than 180 years were to pass before another Eur()pean would visit this sacred spot. We have already had occasion to refer to the famous expedition of Webb and Raper, who followed the route taken by Andrade.

Andrade speaks at length of the temple, which he says is visited by numerous pilgrims even from Ceylon and Bisnaga (Vijayanagar). \"The temple itself is situated at the foot of a rock, from which several springs issue, one of which is so hot that it is impossible for the hand to bear the heat of the water even for a moment. This spring divides into three rivulets, which run into their several basins; in these basins the pilgrims bathe to cleanse their souls, the hot water being tempered with cold. The origin of this spring is explained by the Brahmins as follows. The Fire was very sorry for all the harm it had done on earth by burning houses, woods and fields, and came to this temple to find a cure for its adliction of spirit. It was answered that if it wished to obtain pardon it must stay. So the Fire stayed at the feet of the god and heated the water of the spring. But one fifteenth part refused to submit and still walks the earth and is the cause of all the damage.\" In this temple \"immense treasures have \"been offered in the course of centuries\". Yet the pilgrims' time is very limited, since \"except for three months of the year the temple is covered and as it were buriedunder the snow, which falls in such abundance that the villages in the neighbourhood are uninhabitable, so that during that time the people retire to a distance of three orfour days 2).\" Together with Joshimath, Kedarnath and Panderkeshwar, all situated in the territory of Garhwal, Badrinath is still one of the most sacred and most frequented Hindu temples of India. It is situated 3,170 metres above sea-level against the slope of the Ba-drinath, which is 5,080 metres high and whose glaciers feed the Vishnu-Ganga. From November till May the inhabitants live at Joshimath 3). Raper, who also visited the sanctuary, relates that according to the belief of the Hindus it is the work of some super-natural being.

Though forming part of the kingdom of Srinagar, so the narrative says, the people differ from the rest of the inhabitants both in language and habits. They live principally on rice, herbs and mutton, which makes them stronger than the Hindus. As one of their peculiar traits, it is stated that they eat much snow. \"Once I saw a child two or three years of age with a lump of snow in its hands. Fearing it would injure its health, I had the snow taken away and gave it some raisins; but it had no sooner tasted them than it threw them away and cried for the snow.\" The women cultivate the soil while the men are weavers 2).

Yet this ignorance is much to be regretted even in the face of Horace Wilson's remark in his edition of Moorcroft's journeys, where in speaking of those ancient accounts in general and of Andrade's in particular he says: \"Very little useful information was obtained from these journeys, as the accounts published of them are brief and are chiefly occu-pitd with the personal sufferings of the travellers from the rugged-ness of the route, the inclemency ·of the weather and the inhos-pitality of the people 3).\" If Webb and Raper had carefully perused the old account they would have clearly perceived that on his arrival at Badrinath Andrade had actually crossed the high snow-covered ridges and therefore the Great Himalayan Range, and now stood on its northern slope; with greater care would the British surveyors have examined the neighbourhood, and neither Raper in his account, nor Webb in his map, would ever have placed the source of the Alaknanda on the southern side of the Himalaya 4}, a mistake repeated by Colebrooke in his article on the sources of the Ganges 5).

Some of the herbs at high elevations give out a smell when rubbed, and these are brought in to account for the sickness. The much-abused onion which grows wild in some parts at a good height up, often has these things laid to it. Of course an easy answer to this hypothesis is that the effect is greatest at those heights whence all these plants and even all vegetation are absent\" 1). For several days Andrade had been waiting for a caravan or any other opportunity to cross into Tibet when he was advised that the rajah of Srinagar had given orders to stop him from continuing his journey. It would seem that even thus early people were not anxious to throw open the sacred territory of the Dalai Lama to the mistrusted men of the West. The Portuguese, however, resolved to be beforehand with his antagonists, and having obtained sufiicient information he ventured on the passage on his own accocnt, though, as he states himself, it was not the season. Leaving his travelling-companion behind he started with two Christian servants, boys as he calls them, and one of the Mana men his guide. For two days he pushed ahead as fast as he could, but on the third morning he was overtaken by three natives, who had been sent after them by the governor of those parts. They first addressed themselves to the guide, whose wife and children they said had been thrown into prison and would certainly be put to death, unless he returned without delay. Andrade was also threat-ened. His companion who had stayed behind would be made answerable for his disobedience, his· belongings would be confis-cated, and besides, what could he gain, as he was sure to perish at this unfavourable season of the year? The guide at once retraced his steps, but Andrade refused to return, and no doubt somewhat rashly, being insufficiently equipped, proceeded on his journey accompanied by the two Christians. The road became terrible in-deed. The snow was several feet deep, sometimes they sank into it up to their chests, sometimes even up to their shoulders.

The intense cold numbed theirhandsandfeetandfaces,so that Andrade hurting his finger against something lost part of it. \"Having no sense of pain I should not have believed it, had not a copious flow of blood shown it to be a fact. Our feet were frozen and swollen, so much so that we did not feel it when later on they touched a. piece of red-hot iron .... To this must be added a great aversion to food of any kind, and a violent thirst which could hardly be quenched by eating snow. There was water, indeed, but it flowed at a great depth under the snow, as did the river Ganges itself .... Thus thE:. journey was continued to the summit of the mountain range, where the river Ganges takes its rise from a large pond, and from the same another river takes its rise, which waters the territories of Tibet 1).\" This last statement of Andrade's is the great controverted point of his narrative. At the beginning of this chapter we remarkedron Markham's contention that Andrade reached the lake of Mansaro-war 2). This error has been added to by a work of high excellence the Cyclopaedia of India, which ascribes to Andrade the statement that this lake is the source of the Ganges and the Indus. \"His jour-ney was made in 1624 and is described by commentators and geo-graphers, because of his mentioning this lake [Mansarowar] as the source of the Ganges and Indus, instead of the Sutlej. There is no doubt, however, that the voyage is genuine though we have no details of it 3).\" It is hardly netessary to add that Markham's statement occurs regularly in those writers who copy from him'). To substantiate his assertion the latter refers to the Portuguese edition of the journal (Lisbon 1626), in which, however, not a word is said about the sacred lake, as appears from the quotation given 1} Andrade, p. 14. The text both of the MS. and the printed edition is as follows: \"Nesta forma fomos caminhando ate o alto de todas as serras onde nasce o Rio Ganga de hum grande tanque e do mesmo nasce tamben outro, que rega as terras do Tibet.\" •) Markham, p. lvi. 1} E.

The mere fact that no name whatever, not even in some mutilated form, is given, should make one pause. For it is extre-mely difficult,not to say impossible, to admit that Andrade, whilst mentioning the name of the sacred shrine of Badrinath, should have passed over in complete silence the name of such a widely famous lake as the sacred Tso Mavang of the Tibetans. But there are weightier arguments against Markham's statement. In the first place Andrade does not speak of a lake (lago), but uses the word pool or pond (tanque), which quite suits the small glacier-basin in the Mana pass from which the Saraswati issues forth 1). It next appears from the quotation above given that this pond was situated among the mountains, not behind them on the pla-teau, as is the case with the lake of Mansarowar~ Furthermore, Markham's statement is absolutely irreconcilable with the time-notices and the sequel of Andrade's journal, as will appear further on; and it is precisely on account of this glaring contradiction that Andrade's reliability is called in question by Holdich, who in this copies directly from Markham 2). What is the explanation of this mistaken interpretation of An-drade's words? We know how for centuries a haze of mystery has hung about the sources of the Ganges. Before it issues from the Himalaya mountains, so Hindu mythology tells us, the sacred stream has already run a long course taking its rise from the lake of Mansarowar or from another called Bindusarovara 3), by which is probably meant the Rakas-tal, which communicates with Man-sarowar. It is this situation which is reproduced on all ancient maps, for example on d'Anville's of the year 1733. This map was based on the survey of two lamas, who,after being instructed by the well-known Pekin cartographer Father Regis S. J., had been sent to Tibet by order of the Emperor Kang-hi. The map was to include the sources of the Ganges, and the two explorers were even to bring home some of its water. Their task was completed in 1717 and they made the river issue from lake Mapama (Mansarowar) on the western side of mount Kentaisse (the Kallas mountains), whilsttheriverTsanpou (Tsangpo) beganeastofit. But, as a revolt 1) Pranco in his description of Andrade's journey uses the confusing word \"lago\". Imagem da Virttule, p. 386. •) Holdich, ~· 70. 1) H.

In 1784 a new and almost equally defective map of the sources of the Ganges was published. It had been con-structed by Anquetil du Perron from the notes of Father Joseph Tieffentaller S. J., the author of the Historisch-Geographische Beschreibung von Hindustan, who, however, was careful to state that his personalinvestigations did not reach beyondHardwar,and that he had supplied the rest from reliable Hindu information 2). Rennell did not improve things, and the numerous theories ad-vanced by him sufficiently show how defective was their author's knowledge of the region of the upper Ganges 3). In discussing du Perron's map Eudes Bonin remarks that the connection between Mansarowar and Rakas-Tal, in which Ryder saw water in 1904, is called Ngangga or Ganga by the natives, and verypertine.ntlyasks if this name may not have led cartographers to· consider that con-nection to be one of the sources of the Ganges'). But leaving this explanation for what it is worth and taking into account the mere fact of these persistent errors in later writers, may it not be tl:at Andrade's description, which is brief and general, has as a mc.tter of course been interpreted so as to fall into line with the current views? There is yet another possibility. In 1667 Athanasius Kircher S. J. speaking of Andrade's journey in his China Illustrata falls into the common error, to which other incorrect statements are added. \"Starting from Lahore and crossing the Ganges, he first discovered Srinagar and Ciapharanga, large and populous towns, and subsequently on the top of a high mountain a large lake, the common reservoir of the Indus, Ganges and other great rivers of India 5).\" A few pages earlier he had already spoken of this com-mon origin, at the same time referring to his map, on which, 1) Du Halde, IV, 577.

This infor-mation, he tells us, he obtained from a Hindu Christian, Joseph, one of Andrade's two companions, who happened to be at Rome just then. The man, he adds, was 86 years old 1). With the full text of Andrade before him it may be left to the reader to judge how much value is to be attached to this oral communication made forty years after the event. Most likely the fabled origin of the Ganges had played tricks on the memory of the Hindu. It is possible, as Sven Hedin believes 2}, that Kircher had some vague knowledge of Mansarowar lake from the information of the Hindu and of Father RothS. J., the companion of Father Grueber, of whom we are to speak in a later chapter, and that he combined this with such details of Andrade's journey as were known to him. As against this, however, it should be stated that there is not a line or word in Kircher to betray personal acquaintance with Andrade's narrative. He would rather seem ·to have known only the title, and relying on the words Novo Descobrimento do gram Cathayo, he adds a fresh mistake, and makes Andrade travel via Rt.dok through the countries of the Tanguts and the Tartars into China. The scarcity of Andrade's journal and the wide circulation of Kircher's works may perhaps enable us to understand the con-stant repetition on the latter's authority of the error in question. Here again reference to the narrative would have proved useful. To return to the discovery. Though the Ganges derives its waters from many quarters, wemaypointout thattheAlaknandaisone of the chief sources. A river, SirS. G. Burrard rightly remarks, which is fed by several glaciers, cannot be attributed to any one source, and it is probable that not a twentieth part of all the water of the Ganges is obtained from one and the same glacier. If, however, it rested with him to determine the principal source he would decide for the Alaknanda, the two principal branches of which are the Dauli and the Vishnu-Ganga 3}. On the authority of J. Herbert, who visited those regions in 1817, the Bhagirathi, which is formed by the meltings of the glacier of Gangotri, had for years been con-sidered as the source, when in 1851 Richard Strachey protested against this view 4). His brother, John Strachey, writes on this 1) Kircher, China Illustrata, p. 49. 1) Hedin, Transhimalaja, III, 274; Southern Tibet, I, 166. 1) Burrard, p. 139. •) Strachey, p. 64."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"60 ANTONIO DE ANDRADE point at greater length: \"Almost every work on the Geography of India still tells us that the Ganges has its origin in the glacier, or, as it is oftener and inaccurately called, the snowbed of Gangotri, where it issues from the ice-cave, the 'Cow's mouth' of the sacred books of the Hindus. The truth is that, apart from mythology and religion and common belief, and judging as we judge less holy streams, Gangotri has no claim to be called the source of the Ganges .... The main stream is the Alaknanda, which has a much longer course and a much larger body of water than the Bhagirathi; its most distant sources are on the southern side of the watershed, near the Niti and Mana passes into Tibet, and it collects the drain-age of the peaks and glaciers of the Kumaon and Garhwal Hima-laya from Nanda Devito the sacred shrines of Badrinath and Kedarnath 1).\" Andrade, therefqre, was on the Mana pass at the origin of the Vishnu-Ganga or rather of the Saraswati, as its upper reaches are called. It was, so he tells us, a large pond or pool with another outlet towards Tibet 2). There is in fact a lake called Deb Tal drawn on John Walker's map of 1827 but no stream issues in ~he direction of Tibet 3). Relying on Walker Ritter reproduced ·it in his map of the Himalaya mountains in 1832 4). The lake having disappeared from modern maps, I doubted if I could consider Walker a sufficient authority. He might have been misinformed and fuller knowledge might have led to the omission. I applied to Dr. Herm. Haack of Gotha for a solution of the difficulty. With obliging kindness, for which I wish to thank him once more, he under-took to examine Perthes' rich collection of maps, which led to the following result: \"Lake Deb Tal is found on official maps up to 1865. After that the lake begins to disappear and the name alone is retained, but at present this too seems to be disappearing.\" This did not seem to settle the question, and to guard against the pos-sibility of any doubt I ventured to apply to Colonel Sir S.

He cour-teously furnished me with the following reply, for which I here again acknowledge my indebtedness: \"The Saraswati rises at the Mana pass 20 miles north-west of the great peak of Kamet. A gla-cier descends from the Mana pass on the southern side and forms the ultimate source of the Vishnuganga. This glacier ends near the lake or-pool of Deo Tal or Deb Tal; this pool is about 400 yards long and is canted by the lateral moraine of another glacier de-scending from the west. The height of Deo Tal is about 17,200 feet. A little lower down the stream than Deo Tal is another small lake, Rakas Tal. The names Deo Tal and Rakas Tal appear on the Indian maps 4 miles= 1 inch altho' the lakes are too small to be shown or drawn.\" This is decisive, it proves the accur-racy of Walker's map, and settles the question. Only one point remains obscure namely, what A!J.drade meant when he spoke of the other outlet of Deo Tal towards Tibet. Such an outlet is on the face of it an impossibility, the lake being situated on the southern side of the saddle of the Mana pass. But do Andrade's words of necessity require this interpretation? Above we have translated from the Portuguese as follows: \"Thus the journey was continued to the summit of the mountain range, where the river Ganges takes its rise from a large pond, and from the same [pond] another river takes its rise, which waters the territories of Tibet 1). First of all the Portuguese text might be rendered somewhat diffe-rently, though less naturally, as follows: \"Thus the journey was continued to the summit of the mountain range, where the river Ganges takes its rise from a large pond, and from the same [sum-mit] another river takes its rise, which waters the territories of Tibet.\" If 'the same' is taken to refer to 'summit', all difficulty vanishes, for there is in fact on the northern side of the Mana pass a mountain stream, which joins the Sutlej near Totling. But this reading does not recommend itself to the writer; though grammat-ically correct, it is, to say the least, less obvious and somewhat forced and can hardly be taken to be the expression of Andrade's thought.

Hedin seems to take this explanation as the obvious one. The other river \"which waters the territories of Tibet,\" he remarks, is of course a brook which rises on the pass or in its immediate neighbourhood and goes to joi11 the Sutlej near Totting 1). But whichever expla-nation we take, orevenifwe suppose Andrade to havemadeamis-take, the importance of his expedition is in no way affected by it any more than it is diminished by the removal of his supposed discovery of lake Mansarowar from the list of his achievements. After this long but necessary digression let us continue our jour-ney under the guidance of the narrative. Having reached the highest point among the mountains, that is the highest point of the Mana pass, the vast plains of Tibet stretched themselves before them 2). Behind them lay the heights, though further ob-stacles were still to be encountered. ''It was all one dazzling whiteness to our eyes, which had been weakened by snow-blindness, and we could make out nosignofthe road we were to follow.\" The situation became serious especially on account of the increasing weakness of his two co:npanions. Dur-ing the night, therefore, he made up his mind that to get help the two should return to Mana, which could easily be accomplished in six days, whilst he would wait for them on the spot with some provisions. But the next morning they neither would nor dared start without him, so that Andrade, if he did not wish to lead them to certain death, was forced to go back with them. Their frozen feet made progress almost impossible and even now they might have perished, had they not been met after three days by a Bhatia sent after them by the people of Mana, who feared that the sove-reign of Tibet would hold them responsible for any misadventure that should befall the stranger. After another three days' march they made some caves their temporary camp; here they were joined by Manuel Marques, who carried with him the necessary provisions, and together they waited till the snows had sufficiently melted.\" 8) 1) Hedin, Transhimalaja, III, 275. 1) Andrade, p. 15. 1) The account of this episode as given by Launay I, 26 is derived from a transla-tion and incorrect."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"ANTONIO DE ANDRADE 63 When at length the time for starting had come, the travellers were still suffering from snow-blindness, which troubled even the natives, notwithstanding the eye-guards made of gauze. Andrade had been careful to advise the king of Tibet of his coming, where-upon the latter at once sent two guides and later on three horses to facilitate the journey. Thus in the beginning of August 1624 the first European entered the 'cidade real', the Tibetan town of Chaparangue 1). More than two centuries were to pass before any other Euro-pean, with the exception of a few missionaries, was to reach what is now the town of Tsaparang in the valley of the Langtschen-Kamba or upper Sutlej 2). Duriri.g this period various opinions have been entertained with regard to its situation and importance. Kircher raised it to the rank of the first city of Tibet 8), from which eminence, however, it had to step down when in the eighteenth century the sacred city of Lhasa became known. In 1812 Moor-croft entered the Sutlej valley, but brought no information about the town of Andrade 4). It was only in 1818 that another English-ffiV\\, Fraser, learnt from two natives ofthose parts that Tsaparang was a place of importance and the residence of a rajah. It was said to be situated in a hilly plain at one month's distance from Gar-tok 5). It is strange to find the missionary Father Hue stating as late as 1857 that the town is not found on any map and that he never heard its name mentioned during his stay in Tibet 8). Yet it occurs on d' An ville's map of 1733 and on all-later ones, whilst in 1855 Adolf Schlagintweit had visited the town. \"Tsaparang\", he says, \"is only inhabited in summer and though it is situated on a fairly frequented trade-route, it has of late years considerably declined in prosperity 7).\" He estimated the number of houses 1) Only Odorico de Pordenone reached Tibet before Andrade, but he arrived from China and did not enter the Sutlej basin.

At present it is a poor hamlet at an altitude of4,750metrescontaining some sixteen inhabitants a). The arrival of the stranger caused no slight commotion. Atfirst the king, unable to believe that a man, not a trader, could under-take such a journey, was somewhat displeased, but after the first interview, in which the missionary explained the reason of his coming, both he and the queen showed themselves quite pleased. A religious conviction prompting such deeds of daring did not fail to impress him, and when a few weeks later Andrade insisted on being allowed to leave, as otherwise the pass would be closed, he could only obtain permission on condition of his returning the following year. Andrade gives no description of Tsaparang only noting that it is situated on a river. The site .of the town was very minutely explored by Captain G. M. Young in 1912 and with the help of his notes there is no difficulty in reconstructing the town as it was at the time of Andrade's visit. \"Tsaparang\", he writes, \"stands on and around the base of a steep promontory which juts out like a buttress from the plateau into the river bed.

The district of Tsaparang with the town of the same name form part of the Tibetan province of Hundes or Nari Khor-sam, which from Rakas Tal to Shipki is cut in two by th,e Sutlej. This river flows through a plateau 4,500 metres high, in which it has furrowed a bed or rather a gorge-like valley 900 metres deep, which, according to Colonel Sir S. G. Burrard, may be compared with the famous caii.on of the Colorado River 1). Agriculture is possible only in these lower parts watered by the river. The only tree is the poplar, while the high plateau is a treeless waste with some spare grass here and there, hardly sufficient for a nomad population 2).

The journey was all that could be wished. The villages along the way supplied Andrade and his party with provisions: goats, rice and butter, and several men were sent along with them to see them off at the frontier. Three days beyond the capital they were over-taken by three men carrying six boxes full of figs, small but excel-lent, more than 2,000 of them, rareties come from the king's towns twelve or fifteen leagues from Tsaparang. It was a parting token of affection from the king and queen. At Mana Andrade was detained by a war, which might have proved disastrous to his Tibetan friends. From this village he anxiously watched' the course of events. Three rajahs, tributaries of the Tibetan king, had taken up arms against him and the oppor-tunity was made use of by the rajah of Srinagar to invade Tibet at three points at once. One of his armies numbered 12,000 men with 11,000 muskets and twenty small pieces of artillery, the second 20,000, the third was smaller 1). But as a heavy snowstorm broke over the J?Ountains, and the passes forming the lines of communication were held by the Tibetans, who offered a desperate resistance at every point, the whole enterprise failed, and peace was concluded before Andrade left Mana. At the beginning of November 1624 he was back at Agra and on the 8th he wrote the account of the first journey to the land of the living Buddha. Though Andrade's labours are not yet over, and though we are again to meet him in the next chapter, it may be asked here, if he does not deserve more equitable treatment and a more generous appreciation than he has received at the hands of Sir Thomas Hol-dich and the Rev. Graham Sandberg. When, fifteen years ago, at a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society in London Dr. Sven Hedin read a pape1· on his Transhimalayan expedition, he had to sustain a sharp attack from the same Sir Thomas Holdich, to whom the results obtained appeared to be unsatisfactory. But the explorer very rightly reminded his critic of the enormous difficul-ties which had beset him on every side, how literally everything had yet to be done in that newly discovered territory, and how the information which he had been able to gather might even be ')The printed editions have higher figures; those in the text are taken from the MS."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"68 ANTONIO DE ANDRADE called remarkable.

This ignorance, however, on the part of Ritter and most other authors should not surprise. The details prP.served in the missionary records of the time are few and the records themselves difficult of access.

One part of these documents, that is to say such as are in the possession of the Society of Jesus, have now been drawn upon for the writing of this and the subsequent chapters. They have been used chiefly in so far as they contribute to the history of exploration or topo-graphy, the object of the present work being to throw light on the merits of Jesuit missionaries for the enlargement of geographical knowledge. A complete history, therefore, of the Tsaparang mis-sion is outside our scope, though glimpses of the inner life of the mission will occasionally have to be given for the sake of clearness or completeness. As regards the several missionaries who actually entered Tibet or were despatched to that country, of many it is extremely difficult to obtain anything like full information.

Three men were given him, but before their arrival at Agra Andrade, probably un-willing to risk missing the season, had started June 17, 1625, ac-companied by Father Gonzales de Sousa 2) and his companion in former perils, Brother Manuel Marques. After a ten weeks' journey, again through Garhwal, where the rajah of Srinagar once more molested them, and, in spite of a fir-roan from Jehangir, even robbed them of the greater part of their belongings, Tsaparang was reached a second time on August 28. At a distance of four days from the city two servants of the king had waited ior them with three horses, provisions and presents. Their goods were exempted from all dues, a thing never done be-fore, and a privilege not to be disdained, since one tenth of the value was exacted 3). Andrade's knowledge of the country quickly grew. From anum-ber of merchants coming from China with porcelain, tea and other merchandise, he learned that Tsaparang lay one and a h11f months' journey from 'Ussang' (Utsang), Ussang itself being within some twenty days' distance from China 4).

Franco (Imagem p. 400-415) gives a general outline of this second journey. 1) Little is known of Gonzales de Sousa. He was born at Mathozinhos (Portugal) in 1589 and entered the Society of Jesus in 1605. After six years he was sent to India and had worked in the Mogul empire since 1619, when he went to Tibet. We cannot say how long he stayed there, but it must have been a very short time; the catalogue of members of the Society of Jesus for 1627 mentions the Mogor mission as his place of residence. In the catalogue of 1633 his name does not occur, so be must have died before that date. 1) Andrade, MS. Letter of September zo, z625.

In this new territory then, where no neglected Christians were found, though many religious ceremonies of the people bore some outward resemblance to those of the Catholic Church, they started the work they had come to do. The king kept his promise and himself urged in April 1626 the building of a church and of a house for the missionaries. An excellent site was secured in the town near the king's palace. Its position protected it from the cold and ii. had the sun upon it from early morning. The natives living on the spot had their dwellings pulled down but were given. better houses elsewhere. To secure greater privacy the road passing near the place was turned in another direction. The king rased to the ground two of his own houses that the Father:s might have a garden with flowers for the church. On Easterday, April12, 1626, was laid the foundation-stone of the first Christian church in Tibet 2). Probably one or two months after this ceremony, cer-tainly before the completion of the church on August 15 of the same year, came the new arrivals from India. Andrade himself went to meet them at some days' distance from the town 8). They were the Fathers Joao de Oliveira 4), Alano 1) Andrade, Letter of Aug. zs, I736; Lettere annue dei Tibet p. 5. 1) Andrade, Letter of Aug. IJ, z6:~6; Lettere annve del Tibet, p. 52.

These reinforcements, howe-ver, were not deemed sufficient by the enterprising Andrade. He had established another station at \"Rodoa, a town belonging to a petty ruler, whose territory borders on Tibet\" 8), so he sent for more help from the Mogor mission. Father Antonio Pereira'), therefore, joined them at Tsaparang in 1627, as is stated by him-self in a letter of November 12 of the same year. This Rodoa is no doubt the district and town of Rudok, situated at the nor-them base of the Transhimalaya mountains and the southern shore of the Nyak-tso, as appears from a letter of Andrade's, presently to be discussed, in which the town of Rudok is express-ly mentioned. It is-described by Littledale as \"very picturesquely situated, its site covering a steep hill, which stands isolated on a plain. On the top is a large palace something similar to that at Leh, and several monasteries painted red. All the houses, which were in tiers, had once been whitewashed, but the colours :fiad toned down, and, with the remains of an old wall round the town, the whole effect was extremely good 6}.\" It must remain a matter of conjecture what may have induced Andrade to go socfar afield and to undertake mission work at 200 kilometres' distance in the Mogor mission as appears from the list of missionaries for 1636 and 1641. After this his name is no longer mentioned but the date of his death remains unknown. 1) Alano dos Anjos' real name was Alain de Ia Beauchue. Born at Pont-a-Mousson in Lorrain in 1592 he entered the Society of Jesus in 1607, and in 1622 was sent to India where he adopted a Portuguese name. When he was directed to Tibet, he had just applied for the mission of China or Japan, as appears from a letter he wrote to the General, dated Goa, February 13, 1625. He was still there in 1633 though it is not known when he quitted that country. In 1636 he moved from Agra to Sr4lagar in Garhwal, where he died shortly afterwards. Southwell (Bwliotheca Scriptorum Soeietat$s ]esu (Romae 1676) p. 16) speaks highly of him as a mathematician. I) Francis Godinho was born at Evora (Portugal) in 1596, entered the novitiate in 1615 and sailed for India in 1619. Owing to ill-health he remained only one year in Tibet and after two years spent at Agra he definitively returned to the mission-dil!-trict of Goa, where he was engaged at Daman, Diu, Goa and Bassein. He died at Goa, January 30, 1662. Sommervogel (Ill, 1521) confuses this missionary with a certain Francis Godin of Mons (Belgium) who never was in Tibet. 1) Cordara, I, 527, \"Rodoa, quae est urbs reguli Thibetano accolae\". \") Anthony Pereira was born at Lixa (Portugal) in 1596 and joined the Society in 1612.

Probably in 1630 he went back from Tsaparang to Goa, for in 1631 he again set out from this place to Tibet, which, however, he did not reach, breaking off his journey at Agra. In June 1636 he was at Agra on his way to Srinagar where he stayed till October 1637. After that we lose sight of him and according to Hosten (List. p. 532) he probably left the Society a few years later. 1) Littledale, A Journey across Tibel, from Norllt to South, antl West to L!ltlllk. -Geographical Journal, VII (1896) p. 477."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE TSAPARANG MISSION 73 from Tsaparang. There are no details in any available document,. and it is even impossible to state positively that Andrade went to Rudok in person. All we know is that the presence of the \"Lamas of the West\" was known in the neighbouring countries, for we learn from Andrade that the king of Ladakh wished to see him, and that in the same year 1627 the king of Uts~g sent him a fir-man and a letter of invitation 1). Whether these invitations were ever accepted there is no evidence to show. The only indication that may possibly point to a stay in Ladakh is to be found in a let-ter of Father de Azevedo, who, staying in 1631 at Gya with the ex-king of Mariul, calls the latter a great friend of Andrade's 1). That the missionary should have visited Lhasa, however, is quite incorrect. Father Desideri, it is true, writes fom Leh August 5, 1715, that \"it is said, butlamnotsure, thattenortwelveyears~o the king of the said third Tibet [Utsang] sent people to Mogor in . I search of Fathers of the Society of JesU&, because they say that a dress, a biretta and other things of Father Andrade are there\" 1), but this is no proof that he was ever there himself. At the early sack of the mission-buildings of Tsaparang some of Andrade's or some other missionary's garments may easily have been carried off by Tibetans and finally have found their way to Lhasa; but it is even more probable, supposing Desideri's story to be correct, that these objects had once belonged to Father Cacella, who died at Shigatse in 1630 '), or to the Fathers Grueber and d'Orville, who passed through Lhasa in 1661 6). The only excursion Andrade speaks of is the one he made, in the company of the king, to a town at about half a day's journey from Tsaparang, where there were many temples and some 500 lamas; to celebrate the occasion as many as 2,000 had assembled from the neighbourhood 6). No doubt the monastery-town of Totling is meant, where the dilapidated buildings still speak of the former glories of the once famous shrine in the upper valley of the Sutlej. 1) Andrade, MS. z.eue, of September 11, x6117.

Andrade has several things to note about the lamas, from which it appears that by the side of the more ancient 'Red-caps' the younger Gelugpa-sect of the 'Yellow-caps' was settled in Guge: The lamas, he tells us, are divided into ten or twelve kinds, differ-ing ·from each other by their rites and ceremonies. They do not marry; some live in communities, others each in his own house. They wear one sleeveless garment leaving their arms bare,andover it another that comes down to their feet. Their wearing-apparel is generally red, whilst their head-gear is either red or yellow. At their religious celebrations they use tmmpets generally made of metal but sometimes of the bones of human anns or legs 3). To remind themselves of death they wear necklaces made of human bones and for the same reason they use skulls as drinking-vessels. The common people do not as a mle frequent the temples, which are nearly always closed; they go there only on two days of the year to attend the religious feasts 4). The missionaries must have been struck, not only during the celebrations just mentioned, but all during their sojourn in Tibet by the ubiquity of a peculiar formula of Tibetan prayer. In every spot and at every hour of the day it confronts the traveller. From city wall and temple roof, from stone heap and mountain pass the mys-terious words stare forth. They are sounded in the Tibetan's ear throughout his life; he hears them as he rises in the morning, he murmurs them as he lies down at night. So intimately has this for-mula become woven into. the life and so deeply has it impressed it-self upon the land of Tibet that Hedin cannot picture to his mind its blue lakes and snow-clad mountains without this mystic legend, whic4 Andrade-was the first to publish to the world: 'Om mani padme hum'. He could not, however, interpret its meaning, because none of the lamas was able to furnish a reasonable expla-nation to all his questionings 5). He also dwells on his debates on 1) Rawling, p. 285 ff. 1) Hedin, Transhimalaja, III, 264 ff. \"l Sherring (p. 84) mentions this custom as still existing, whilst it was noted as early .as 1582 by Monserrate in his Commentarius, p. 594. •) Andrade, LeUeJ' of August r6, r626; LeUere annue del Tibet, p. 6-9. •) Andrade, LeUer of August r6, r6z6; Lettere annu-e del Tibet, p. 36.

As to the future, Andrade expected great things and his companions were equally sanguine. \"It will be one of the most flourishing [missions] which the Society of Jesus possesses\" 1), wrote Anjos in November 1627. Though the number of Christians was still small, the prospects were fair. The king used all his power and influence to further the work of the missionaries, not without rousing the discontent of the lamas, whose religious chief was his own brother. Soon they were in a fer-ment, but no one expected that the explosion would come so soon, nor that it would be so formidable. Andrade's departure no doubt left their hands more free. Though the exact date is not known, it is certain that before 1630 he was recalled from Tibet to take upon him the honourable task of governing the whole mis-sion-province of Goa 2). Thus the Tsaparang mission in losing its energetic and enterprising head sustained a loss that could not be compensated for by the solicitude and care of a distant Superior. His mtagonists seized the opportunity and within a short time af-ter his depaH:ure, in the same year 1630, a revolution broke out which put an end to the reign of the friendly king. The course of events is related by Cordara 3), but it was described with greater fulness of detail by Andrade himself, when on February 4, 1633, he despatched from Goa an account of the mis-sions of Mogor and Tibet to the General of the Society at Rome. It is from this document that the following particulars are taken. For a long time there there had been a violent quarrel between Guge and Ladakh. Eighteen years before the king of Guge had had a son, the heir to the throne, born to him, but at his birth the queen had lost her reason, \"so that she is still ailing\". When after two years all efforts to cure her proved useless, the king resolved to contract a fresh marriage, although the Tibetan religion per-mits no bigamy. The new bride was a sister of the king of Ladakh and Mariul. The marriage-contract was made by proxy, but when 1) \"Sera hua das mais florentes que tem hoje a Companhia.\" ') From 1610 the Jesuit mission in India had consisted of the provinces of Goa and of Malabar, Cochin being the chief centre of the latter.

Andrade is quite ignorant as to what may have been the king's motive, but he is certain that this event was the main cause of the king's ruin. For Ladakh had im-mediately begun the war, which with occasional intervals had con-tinued for eighteen years impoverishing the country by rendering impossible the working of fields or mines 1). Another cause was the great discontent among the numerous lamas at the conduct of the king. The latter had proceeded some-what hastily in introducing the new religion and some of the measures adopted against the lamas were decidedly imprudent. We may note a few of them from Andrade's letters. Thus in 1626 he had taken away from his brother, the Chief-Lama, all his revenues, because he had received into the fraternity of lamas one hundred and thirty new candidates. His excuse was that, if his brother con-tinued thus, he would deprive him of all his soldiers and become a dangerous rival 2). The year after Andrade wrote that the king had become positively hqstile to the lamas, in particular to his brotl:ler. All these influences, Andrade writes in his letter of February 4, 1633, came to a head at a time when the king was seriously ill. Shortly after the departure of the missionary some powerful mili-tary commanders (probably lamas, who were not by their profes-sion excluded from.such posts) rose in open revolt, called in the aid of the king of Ladakh and offered him the crown. With their help the latter laid siege to Tsaparang. The town occupied an almost impregnable position. It was built along the slopes of a hill the lower part being defended by strong walls and fortifications. From the higher middle ground there rose another eminence flat-tening to a sort of plateau at the top, and crowned with a second line of fortifications. This stronghold was inaccessible on all sides and could only be reached by a stairway cut out in the interior of the mountain. There was another stairway, also cut out of the rock and more than 400 metres 3} long, leading down t.o two springs situated under the plateau. The castle was well victualled, and there were 1 ,000 fire-arms with plenty of gun-powder and ball'). 1) 0 cavar nas minas. -What mines they were is not specified. 1) Andrade, Letter of August, I6, I6z6; Lettere annue del Tibet, p. 24. 1) Ducentas bra<yas; 1 bra<ya = 2,02 metres.

When this had lasted a month the treacherous counsel was acted upon with the result that the king and his family were kidnapped and carried off to Leh. The whole country was conquered and the Christians, numbering about 400, were singled out for retribution; many were reduced to slavery and had to share the king's exile. Part of the Tsaparang garrison had, at the last moment, retreated within the castle offering such a stubborn resistance that in the end they were allowed withdraw with military honours to Utsang. Here the viceroy ofRudokhad also taken refuge leaving the town to the conquerors, who destroyed the mission and conducted the two missionaries prisoners to Leh. Soon, however, they were restored to liberty and sent back to Tsaparang. Thus far Andrade's account of the course of events. As regards the men engaged in the Tibet mission at the time of the catastrophe, from an unpublished letter of Father de Castro, wri£ten from Bengal November 20, 1631, to Father Septalio at Milan, we learn that there were five missionaries in Tibet. No names are given, but Andrade, de Souza, Pereira and Godinho having left, they could only be dos Anjos, de Oliveira, de Azevedo, da Fonseca 1) and Marques. Their house and church at Tsaparang were sacked but there was no loss of life. The anonymous author of the 'Memoire su1 le Thibet et su1 le royaume des Eleuthes' in the Lettres edifiantes speaks of a war carried on by a Christian king of Western Tibet against the Dalai Lama. \"During the reign of the Dalay-Lama Hotolon-pou-Hang, Tsang-pa-han ruled over a great part of Thibet, west of Lassa, as far as the sources of the Ganges and in the country of Sirinagar on the Ganges. Father Dandrada, a Jesuit, who was in 1624 at the court of Tsang-pa-han, assures us that this prince was a great pro-tector of the Christian religion, and the Tartar history of that time is clear enough on the point, since it tells us that Tsang-pa-han abandoned the faith of Fo or the Lamas, that he wished to destroy it, that he ill-treated his people, that for this reason the Typa and the Dalay-Lama called to their help Kouche-han, Prince of the Eleuths of Coconor; that Couche-han came to Thibet with a con-1) He had arrived in 1629; a native of Mourao, where he was born in 1600, he had entered the Society at the age of twenty."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"78 THE TSAPARANG MISSION siderable army, that a bloody battle was fought, and that Tsang-pa-han was defeated and killed in the combat\" 1). There are in this extract facts in evident agreement with those narrated above, but it is equally clear that there is a strong ad-mixture of error and that the author is confusing different events. This Hotolon-pou-Hang, who can be no other than the famous Dalai Lama Ngavang Lobsang, did not intervene in the affairs of Western Tibet about the year 1630. This ambitious intriguer did, indeed, wage war against one of the Tibetan kings, in which he was supported by Goutchi-Khan, the chief of the Mongolian tribes about the Koko Nor, but this was not till1640 or later, so that there is no connection with the events at Tsaparang 2). Nor was Ladakh at war with Central Tibet in 1630. For from the ancient chronicles, made accessible by Dr. K. Marx, it only appears that Sengge-nam-gyal, king of Ladakh in 1630, carried on a war with the central provinces of Guge or Tsaparang 8). It was only during the reign of his second successor, Lha-ch'endelegs-nam-gyal, that there was trouble between Ladakh and Lhasa occasioned by a quarrel between the latter country and Bhutan, as also appears from Marx's data 4). Moreover, it may be safely asserted that, however great may have been the favour shown by the king of Tsapa:rang to the new preachers, he certainly never went so far as to embrace Christian-ity. Though Young writes that \"in the course of time the king and most of his family were baptized\" li), he adduces no proof; in fact it would be impossible to bring forward any evidence at least as far as the king is concerned. This is a safe inference from the silence on this point of all the letters both of Andrade and of those whocameafterhim;havingsomuch tosayofhimhowcould theyor would they have passed over a point of such first rate importance? Azevedo only writes that the king was inclined to become a Chris-tian and had even promised to receive baptism, but he adds that on account of illicit cohabitation the baptism had to be put off 5). It is to be regretted that Andrade does not mention the king's 1) Lettres ~tlifla.ntes, XIII, 229. 1} Milloue, p. 143. Das, p. 228. 1) Marx, Three Documents (z89z) p. 130.

Little value, therefore, attaches to their reply. According to the Rev. A. H. Francke of the Moravian mission, famed for his historical researches on Western Tibet, Chodagpo (Jo-drag-po) would mean 'strong, severe lord'. He thinks he has found t.;.e real name of the king in two old inscriptions, one of which he discovered in 1909, at the desert camping-place of Hor-ling on the frontier of Guge and Spiti, the other at Tabo in Spiti. Tho former relates that there Oiice ruled at Tsaparang a king Khri-bkra-shis-grangs-pa-lde, and by his calculations Francke is led to place his reign between 1600 and 1630 A. D. and to infer that he is probably the very king whom Andrade visited in 1624. The second votive tablet would appear to the discoverer to confirm his result, since it not only mentions the name of the king but also bears the following legend: \"He who clears away all the-apostasy and dark-ness at the great palace of Tsabarang-rtse\" 2). But wat Francke thus takes to strengthen his conclusion, does it not in fact weaken it, and do not the words of the inscription clash with the.events above recorded? The point is not further discussed in Francke's Antiquities of Indian Tibet, but I am enabled to quote from a let-ter of December 11, 1913, in which an accord is attempted. To ex-plain the second inscription it is assumed that the king of whom we are speaking either played a double game, on the one hand help-ing the missionaries, and on the other courting the Buddhist party; or that after favouring Christianity he was frightened by the approaching revolution into a belated zeal for Buddhism, and to save his crown took measures of repression against the mission. Neither of these hypotheses, however, seems to fit in with the 1) Young, p. 187. 1) Francke, p. 36."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"80 THE TSAPARANG MISSION known facts. As to the latter supposition, besides the inherent im-probability of such a radical change from protector to persecutor within the short space of one or at most two years, we should have the inexplicable silence of the letters of the missionaries. Azevedo, who instituted an inquiry into the events on the spot immediately after their occurrence, writes in the journal from which we quoted above: \"The king, who was our great friend, is no longer king, but has been taken prisoner by a crafty pagan\". The hypothesis also of his double dealing seems inadmissible if we remember the king's measures, especialiy tho.se he took against his brother, the Chief Lama. In our opinion both the king and the missionaries in their efforts to introduce Christianity had been wanting in tact and prudence, and the revolution took them by surprise. As to the two inscriptions of Horling and Tabo, for our present purpose at least we must leave them an open question. By the name Khri-bkra-shis-grags-pa-lde cannot be meant the usurping king, a younger brother of the king of Leh, for his name was Indra Bodhirnam-rgyal1}. It is equally impossible to determine the name of the conquered king from the Leh chronicles, as he is onl~· re-ferred to as Los-long, 'the really blind:. As things are the writer cannot help confessing to some misgivings on the subject of the date 1600 to 1630; and if this date is not demonstrably certain, may we not have to look back to an earlier religious war <?r to the reform of Tsong-kapa for an explanation of the two inscriptions? On February 14, 1631, still unaware of the fatal turn of events Andrade despatched the above-mentioned Father Pereira with two companions, FF. Dominic Capece 2) and Francis Morando 8) to the • distant mission. When the first tidings reached him he at once 1) Francke, p. 36. 1) Dominic Capece was born at Rome in 1598 and became a Jesuit in 1619. He was sent to India in 1629 and stayed behind at Agra when on his way to Tibet in 1631. Two years later he was permanently established in the Mogor mission, where he died March 26, 1634. 1) Francis Morando, who was born at Parma (at Bologna according to others) in 1597 and entered the Society in 1618, went to India in 1629. Staying behind at Agra he was engaged in the Indian mission for over twenty-two years, at least till 1653, as the catalogues inform us. For sixteen years he was attached to the court of the Gover-nor of Bengal, and in 1649 he was at Agra to have the Persian works of Father Je-rome Xavier copied. (Cf. Maracci, p. 23 and 65.)

Azevedo overtook the three at Agra and ordered them to stay and await instructions, whilst he himself proceeded to Tsaparang where he arrived in the company of Marques, whom he had met in Garhwal. Azevedo has left us a very detailed account of his journey and fur-ther experiences, and this journal is in many respects so remarkable as to demand for special treatment in the next chapter. We only note here that, seeing the sad state of affairs, he resolved to go to Leh, accompanied by Oliveira, to have a personal interview with the conqueror, and, if possible, to secure his goodwill. Their suit was successful, and the king granted permission to pursue mission-work at Tsaparang, Rudok and even at Leh. Returning to India the two travellers were back at Agra January 3, 1632.

In 1626 he writes a letter \"di questo Reg-no di Cabul\", in 1627 \"di Regno di Caximir\", in 1631 he is chaplain to Mirza Zul Qamin, a Catholic governor in Bengal, \"at a spot 250 miles from Agra and 300 ~iles from Hugli.\" After November 24, 1632, his letters are again despatched from Agra.

Tsapa-rang is the only mission-station left, all the others have been swept away by the war. Andrade meanwhile had been thoroughly informed of the state of affairs and was going back to Tsaparang in person. He would have done so earlier 1) but his duties forbade. No sooner, however, had he been relieved of the superiorship of the mission, than he made up his mind' and at once set about preparing for the doubt-ful journey. Six, others were to go with him. While in the mi&t of these preparations, he suddenly died March 19, 1634, with symp-toms of poisoning 2) ; thus he was not to see the destruction of his foundation. Thirty-four years of his life he had spent in the vast field of the India mission. The projected journey was now delayed for a year and in the beginning of 1635 the six missionaries set out from Goa under the leadership of Father N ufio Coresma 8). As noted in the list of unpublished documents copies of three of Coresma's letters to the Provincial of Goa have been preserved, so we are fairly fully acquainted with what befell the missionaries. The undertaking, then, was an utter failure, a series of reverses and disasters, which might have dashed the spirits of the most ardent. The empire of the Great Mogul was just being devastated 1) Lett\" of F. de Castro, Aug. f18, .r6J3. 1) This is stated in a letter of Father Antonlo Mendez.

The date of Andrade's death is wrongly given as August 20, 1633, by Denis (I, 545), and as March 6 by Lat1nay (I, 30). 1) Null.o Coresma was born in 1600, probably at San Roman, a village in the dis-trict of Tordesillas in Spain. At the age of sixteen he entered the Society of Jesus, and went to India in 1625, as is stated by Franco, who calls him Nonius Quaresma. After his return from Tsaparang he was at the head of the college of Tanna, or Thana, on the island of Satsette. After 1641 his name is no longer found in the catalogues. In the list for 1653,however, it is noted, that F. Nonius Coresma on his way to India, perished in October 1650 off the coast of Mozambique near the river Licungo. Very likely he had been sent back to Europe after 1641 and was returning to his mission when he met his death."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE TSAPARANG MISSION 83 he writes in his first letter, by a terrible famine which made itself felt as far as Garhwal and Tibet, so that the journey from Surat to Tsaparang cost no less than 3,000 rupees. But this was as nothing compared to the loss of life and of health. \"Of my six companions only one reached Chaparangue with me. Two died on the way, and the other three became so ill, that it would have been inhuman to have taken them further and let them die in this desolate coun-try\" 1}. The three, therefore, were left behind at Srinagar (Garh-wal), whence they probably returned to Agra. They were Father de Freytas 2), Father Caldeira 3) and Brother Barreiros ').

The crossing of the Mana pass was very trying. \"The snow came up to our knees, in many places up to our waist, and a cold numbing wind was blowing.\" Eventually, however, they reached Tsapa-rang. Both the country and the people fell far short of his expecta-tions, and in his letters he does not pretend to disguise his dis-appointment. \"The population is very small, as appears from the fact that from the whole of the territory, which, through lack of knowledge and experience, has been called Cathayo or Tibet, it is impossible to assemble 2,000' warriors, though all are obliged to serve from their eighteenth to their eightieth year.

In his second letter, of the same date as the first, he writes: \"Alone I arrived in this mission ..•. without any companion of all those I took with me.\" (En trey nesta Missio •.•. so sem companheiro algum de quantos trouxe). But this must be a slip, as appears from the very circumstantial ac-count of the first letter. 1) Pietro de Freytas was born at Mondim in Portugal in 1608 and entered the So-ciety of Jesus in India in 1630. He died whilst professor of theology at Goa May 3, 1640. 1) Balthasar Caldeira, born at Macao in 1609, became a Jesuit at Goa in 1627. After a three years' stay in the Mogor mission, he was active in different places, among others in Tonkin, China and Japan; he returned to India, where he filled several offices, and died at Goa May 3, 1678. •) Brother Barreiros was born in 1605 at Lisbon, where he becamealay-brotherof the Society of Jesus at the age of twenty. We find him at Goa in 1633; the years after his return from Garhwal he spent chiefly at Bassein, where he died March 8, 1666. 6) Ambrosio Correa was a native of Aveiro in the north of Portugal; born in 1606 he entered the Jesuit noviciate at Lisbon in 1622.

The governor also who had been appointed by the king of Ladakh was anything .but sympathetic and it was only the hope of pres-ents that withheld him from turning the strangers out of the country at once. They were continually annoyed and vexed by the populace, who repeatedly bombarded their house with stones at night-time, whilst the complaints lodged with the authorities were completely disregarded. The influence of Portugal could not make itself felt here and they were left to fight their own battle; but victory seemed to Coresma to be impossible. The enormous expense was another difficulty, for the country itself had practi-cally no resources to support the mission. \"The country is mostly dry and barren, very mountainous and thinly populated. Trees are entirely wanting, not only fruit-trees but even trees for frre-wood. There are no herbs to serve as food, only a little barley and corn, which thr.:>ugh want of tilled fields is very stunted.

The people have only some flocks of goats and sheep, with which they move from place to place.\" It was practically im-possible to obtain supplies from Hindustan or Srinagar, for \"the carriage of a quantity of rice bought for one rupee at Srinagar is ten or twelve rupees, as everything has to be carried along the passes 2). The description of the sterility of the soil entirely squares with Andrade's, and is, like the latter's, fully confirmed by later travellers. As to the Christian community, it had greatly shrunk in num-bers and had been scattered in different directions, so that in Co-resma's view the sacrifices that had already been made and would yet have to be made, were out of all proportion to the scanty har-vest that might be expected.

Had new difficulties arisen? Or had the king of Ladakh gone back on the permission he had granted to Azevedo? When and how had they quitted the country? These questions must be left unanswered; we have nothing beyond Coresma's statement that he and Marques alone remained behind. Another remark concerns Coresma' s haste in judging of the state of the mission and concluding to the impossibility of working it. Having left Goa at the beginning of 1635 his arrival in the Sutlej basin cannot be placed earlier than June or July, whilst his letter is dated August 30. He had thus at most two months to acquaint himself with and enter into an exceedingly difficult state of affairs. As painted by him this state was, indeed, far from promising, and must no doubt be considered as the backwash of the revolutionary agitations. The question, however, remains whether the writer, soured, it may be, by trouble and adversity, did not see only the da..:-k side of the picture and form his judgment with undue haste and insufficient experience. Though the rapid development of events would seem to justify Coresma, yet in the man himself we look in vain for the energy and will-power of an Andrade, for the resolve and steadfastness of purpose which remains unperturbed in the midst of a trying situation. In the circumstances he would not seem to have been the right man in the right place. From Coresma's third letter dated Agra December 14, 1635, we learn that soon after Correa's departure the situation at Tsapa-rang became worse than ever, so much so that he and Marques were kept prisoners in their house by a strong body of soldiers who cut off all communication with the outside world. Finally they were banished from the country, and even before an answer from the Provincial, Father Tavarez, could have been received, they left Tsaparang, which was no longer what Andrade had called it eleven years before, the 'cidade real' in the valley of the Langtchen-Kamba 1}. They arrived at Agra December 11, i635. On receipt of the two letters of August 30 Tavarez placed the question before his advisers, all of whom recommended the aban-donment of the mission on account of the unsatisfactory results 1) Though Marques is not mentioned in the Jetter of December 14, there can be no doubt that he left together with his Superior."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"86 THE TSAPA~NG MISSION and the impossibility of increasing the support supplied from Goa 1). The advice was acted upon, but at the same time Tavarez made some provision for a possible turn of events by sending Pe-reiraanddos Anjos to Srinagarin Garhwal in June 1636, to devote themselves to the conversion of the Tibetan inhabitants, and to return as soon as circumstances would permit, to the country which they were now debarred from entering 2). DosAnjos had no sooner arrived at Srinagar than he fell ill; he died shortly after-wards. Father Stanislaus Malpichi, a Neapolitan, went to fill his place in January 1637. He advised Castro of his safe arrival adding .\"that the Governor of Chaparangue wrote to the petty king of Srinagar, complaining that he kept his Fathers, and he wrote to the Fathers inviting them to come to Tibet, that he is keeping their house and church intact with their other possessions and animals\" 3). All this, however, raised no sanguine expectations as appears from Castro's remark a few months later: \"Though we have some news from Tibet that the King wishes again to receive us, we cannot fully trust him\"'). Meanwhile there were several among the missionaries who W..!re far from approving the abandonment of the mission; thus we have preserved for us a letter of Father Antonio Me~dez, who writes at length on the point to Mutius Vitelleschi, the General of the Society of Jesus.

Here they waited while Malpichi and Marques took the road of Tsaparang to find out what reliance could be placed upon the king's repeated request for missionaries. They were not kept waiting long. Very soon, Cordara tells us 2), Mal pichi returned alone, bringing the bad news that Tibet was permanently closed. On crossing the Mana pass both himself and his companion had been taken prisoners; an opportunity of escaping had presented itself, which both had seized, but Marques had been captured and for his release a heavy ransom was now exacted.

And this, I pelieve, was another reason why the said three Fathers deter-mined to go back to Agra, because the petty king of Tibete is con-sidered to be a man of bad character and, above all, very dishonest. I have learned this from some merchants who have frequently gone from here to Tibete.\" At the request of Marques himself Castro made a last effort to obtain his release.

Of the mission buildings nothing is left. Captain Young examined very closely every building round about the king's palace. \"I entered every house in the city that I could, but found no trace of a church or mission. Most of the houses are amazingly well pre-served although the roof timbers have been taken long ago for fuel, except in the temples themselves. The lamas no doubt abolished the mission buildings just as thoroughly as they wiped out the king's name from their chronicles. Judging by Andrade's account, the church must have been somewhere near what is now the Dzongpon's house. The inhabitants profess, truthfully I daresay, to have no tradition whatever of the Jesuits or of the king's con-version. I had already sounded the Dzongpon when I met him at Shangtze; I tried him again now, but with no better success\" 1). No trace therefore remains save perhaps one solitary object, of which Young also speaks at the end of his account. \"A row of white washed 'chortens' stands near the Dzongpon's house. One of them some forty feet high towers above the rest; and on its sum-mit there lies horizontally a weather-beaten cross of wood. It may be that that chorten was being built, while the lamas were de-molishing the church close by; and that some one carelessly, or per-haps thinking to lay up treasure for himself in two heavens, planted the rejected emblem on the Buddhist tomb\" 3).

Born at Lisbon in 1578 he left his native country when still a boy and joined the Society of Jesus at Goa at the age of nineteen. On completing his studies he was stationed at several places; thus he was at Diu in 1614 and at Rachol in 1620, after which he was ap-pointed Visitor to the mission of Monomotapa in South-Afri<..a 1). In 1627 he went to the Mogor mission, and he was already fifty-two, when he received his commission for Tsaparang. The full account of the expedition which he wrote in Portuguese and addressed to Father Anthony Freire, the procurator of the Indian missions in Portugal covers 44 large, closely-written pages. It is divided into two parts: from Goa to Agra (p. 1-18), and from Agra to Tibet and back (p. 18-44), of which clearly only the second comes within the scope of this book. It will be found in Appendix I printed at length and with the original pagination 2). As, however, the route from Agra to Tsaparang has been sufficiently described and discussed in the chapter on Andrade, we shall not during this stag~ of his journey follow Azevedo step by step, but only dwell on such points of his description as fill up gaps in Andrade's account or supplement his statements.

Hence this chapter may be considered a first attempt to place in its proper light the pioneer work of this intrepid compatriot of Andrade's. On June 28, 1631, Azevedo left Agra and on his arrival in the town of Srinagar was an eye-witness of a scene of oriental bar-barism. The rajah of Garhwal had died. This prince, it will be remembered, after trying at first to frustrate Andrade's under-takings had afterwards become so friendly with him as to offer the missionary a· site next to his own palace, if he would consent to settle in his capital. His recent death gave Azevedo an opportunity of witnessing a royal Hindu funeral. On a large pile of aromatic materials, chiefly aloe and precious sandal-wood, the body was burnt on the banks of the Alaknanda. Sixty of his wives had to fol-low their lord into the flames, and though some did so voluntarily, most of the wretched women had to be thrown in by main force. It ,-,as not till seven days after this barbarous ceremony that the new king, a boy of seven, could be crowned. As this would detain him too long, he resolved to push on, and was on the point of set-ting out when Manuel Marques arrived from Mana with the object of obtaining fresh supplies of food and sending a report on the situation at Tsaparang to Agra. From him Azevedo learnt the full truth about the revolution that had taken place, \"how the king, our great friend, was no longer ruler, but the prisoner of a crafty pagan,\" and how the prospects of the mission, which had pro-mised so fair, had become very gloomy indeed 1). Having Marques as his guide Azevedo left the capital of Garh-wal July 31. Taking the mountain road along the Alaknanda, the difficulties of which are described at length, the travellers reached Jussy. \"This village is situated on the slope of a famous mountain, the houses are well built and the population is numerous. The place owes its fame chiefly to a large pagoda, which is found in it, flanked by four towers of hewn stone. In front of the main entrance of this pagoda there stands on a pedestal about three metres high the statue of an angel [Anjo] made of bronze, very splendid, and the whole very artistic, not only the statue itself but more especially the features. The statue looks towards the pagoda in a kneeling posture, its hands raised to heaven\" 1).

It cannot be doubted that Azevedo is speaking here of the vil-lage of Josimath at the confluence of the Vishnuganga and the Dauli, to which the people of Badrinath retire in winter. Raper who visited it in 1807, estimates the number of houses \"neatly built of gray stone and roofed with shingles\" at between a hundred and a hundred and fifty. He mentions two temples. One contains the image of Nara-singha, one of the Hindu deities, put up there by a native of Kumaon, of the J osi (J yatshi) class of the Brahmins, to which the place is supposed to owe its name. \"The building is said to be three hundred years old, but it has the appearance of being of much later date, and resembles a private habitation much more than a Hindu place of worship. It is built with gable ends and covered in with a sloping roof of plates of copper\" 1). This description can hardly be made to square with AzeveJo's notes given above, which far better apply to the ancient temple buildings also described by Raper. These are situated in the higher part of the village in a large open space in which the pilgrims pass the night. The temples \"are raised on a terrace about ten feet. high and in the centre of the area stands the principal one, sacred to Vishnu. It is surrounded by a wall about thirty feet square: at each angle and in the centre of each face are inferior temples, con-taining different deities. Several of them were destroyed and thrown down by the earthquake; and most of them are in a very tottering condition. Those which suffered the least and have the images perfect, are the temples of Vishnu, Ganesa, Surya or the sun, and the N audevi. Of these the statues representing the two former are carved in a very superior style of workmanship 1).\" A bronze statue such as is described by Azevedo is not mentioned by Raper; it may possibly have been wrecked by the earthquake above referred to. Dr. K. Boeck, who visited Josimath in 1890, speaks of a large temple to which several hostelries belong, and of a smaller shrine in the neighbourhood, but he gives no descrip-tion 8). Azevedo has also much to say of the pagoda of Badrinath, by him called Badry. \"The whole consists of three badly built low 1) Raper, p. 516. 1) Raper, p. 517. 8) Boeck, Gletscherjclh:•ten, p. 34 7, 349."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"FRANCISCO DE AZEVEDO 97 cottages. The best of the three contains on an altar two images of the god, one of gold and one of stone. In its immediate neighbour-hood there rise three springs, two of which are cold and one is warm, the water of which is so hot that one cannot possibly hold one's hand in it even during the short space required to say two words. This water is conducted to several basins, where the pil-grims may bathe ...• Besides the wealth flowing hither from all parts of India the kings of the neighbourhood have given a large number of villages for the maintenace of the temple\" 1). Raper was told that 700 villages belonged to the pagoda 8) ; Traill, how-ever, in his 'Statistical Sketch of Kumaun' puts thenumberat226, yielding an annual revenue of only 2,000 rupees. From the temple-registers of 1820 he found that the revenue for that year, together with the offerings, amounted to 15,750 rupees, besides 3,000 ru-pees' worth of gold and silver presents 8). At present the annual income is 7,000 rupees '). \"Three times a day,\" continues our traveller, who seems to have had an eye for detail, \"food is offered to the god, in the morning foUl' measures of the best rice with some cocoa-nuts, a large quan-tity of butter and some cake, at midday four handfuls of boiled rice and many spices, and in the afternoon some refreshments. All this is placed before the god, whereupon the doors are closed; after a while the good things are taken away and divided among the Brahmin and his ministers as the god is satisfied with the odour alone .... The mountain district of the pagoda is a sacred place, where the criminals of the surrounding countries may live unmolested. Like the ministers, however, they live at a fairly great distance, as the god will not allow the proximity of any man or woman not perfectly chaste\" 6), which last remark is confirmed by Raper 6). Though considerable every year, the concourse of pil-grims is largest every twelfth year. This was the case last year (1630), when along those terrible mountain roads more than 80,000 pilgrims went thither. A troop of 8,000 jogis, \"the greatest loafers of India,\" went up to the shrine carrying arms, but as the 1) Azevedo, MS. fol. 28.

On their refusal the whole troop was dispersed by force, so that with less joy and more haste they had to return to the place from which they had come, leaving many dead behind. For more than six months Badrinath is uninhabitable through cold and snow 1). Adolf and Robert Schlagintweit, who reached thisfamousspot in August 1855, also refer to this great periodical concourse of pil-grims. \"The greatest number of pilgrims is drawn hither every twelfth year, when the planet of Jupiter enters the Water-bearer, and the Daloka Mela, 'the Fair of the Water-bearer', is held at Hardwar. The number of Hindus Visiting Badrinath in those years is estimated at 40,000 to 50,000\" 11). As regards Mana, it is a wretched hamlet, the population of which subsist on their sheep, which are used as beasts of burden to carry rice into Tibet, bringing back loads of salt. The neighbouring woods are the home of large numbers of muskdeer, from which is obtained the purest and most precious musk that is known B). At Mana Marques stayed behind, as the sheep he had hired to curry his provisions had not yet been got together, and Azevedo set out by himself to try the pass. \"Halfway among these mountains [the Serra do Canda. (Kamet ?) as he has just called them] I dis-covered the pool from which the Ganges issues, according to the information I have received. The Ganges flows southward, the In-dus northward, both for a great distance hidden below the sur-face, but traceable by a peculiar sound; small and hardly visible when they first appear, but soon becoming abundant and power-ful through the number of feeders. The former descends into the plains of Hindustan, flows eastward and makes its way to the Ocean across the plain of Bengal. The Indus flows through the mountains north~ard to Chaparangue, close to which place it bends westward. Later on it flows by the town of Lahore and runs seaward through the country of Sinde. From Lahore onward it is a navigable river\"'). After the long discussion of a very similar passage in Andrade's account there is no need of further comment 1} Azevedo, MS. fol. 28.

The true Indus he is one day to meet at Leh. On August 25 he joined his brethren at Tsaparang, and it is doubtless from their long experience that he obtained the matter for his notes on the people and the country with which this part of his journal abounds. \"This kingdom is one of those which are classed together under the name of Pot [Bod], and it is not the smallest but one of the largest and richest. About a thousand years ago it was ruled over by a king called Chopado, 'the giver of the book', because it was he who brought them the book of the law from China on the other side of Uzangue [Utsang]. Hence he was held in such high honour by the neighbouring princes that they consid-ered it a privilege to become allied to his faJUily2).\" With remark-able accuracy Azevedo here gives the date of the introduction of Buddhism into Tibet. At the beginning of the seventh century the Tibetan King Sron-tsan-Gampo invaded China and compelled the Em:veror Taitsung to subscribe to a treaty of peace by the terms of which he married a Chinese princess whilst retaining his Nepalese wife. With the princess the first elements of civilization entered Tibet. Both women being ardent Buddhists and zealots for their religion, Sron-tsan-Gampo was converted to their faith; he built temples and monasteries, founded Lhasa and sent to India and China for the chief Buddhist books 8). On Tsaparang Azevedo is very brief. The town is built against the slope of a mountain and contains some good dwelling-houses, but most of the inhabitants compelled by cold, live in moun-tain caves, which they call 'pugos'. The castle in which the king resides lies on the top of the mountain and on account ofitssitua-tion and defences is impregnable 4). His description of the people is not flattering 5).

They are not beautiful, rather they are ugly, and so dirty in their person and clothing that they may be said to live in filth from birth till death. This is con-firmed by the latest travellers. Drew writes of the Ladakhis that they \"all have a rooted objection to washing .... Their clothes worn next them are never washed, but are affectionately kept around them until they fall to pieces\" 1). Their natural disposition is gentle and kind, but conjugal faith is not in high esteem, least of all among the men: they will lend their wives to others and not blush to ask the same of their friends. Of polyandry Azevedo says nothing; in fact none of the Tsaparang missionaries mentions this pernicious Tibetan practice, which is spoken of at length by Desi-deri. One practice which Azevedo mentions is a ius primae noctis. \"When they marry, the per!)on who has negotiated the marriage and arranged everything has a right to keep the bride in his house the first night, which in fact is generally done; the next day he gives her back to her husband.\" Divorce is of frequent occurrence The husband conducts his wife back to her parents, and each hold· ing the opposite end of a woollen thread they pull, brea~ the thread, and thus the separation has become an accomplished fact; both parties go their several ways, the father with the son, the mother with the daughter 2). Father Donsen mentions a somewhat similar thread-ceremony still in existence to signify the dissolu-tion of a polyandric marriage. \"When a wife who has lost her hus-band by death does not want to continue to live with his younger brothers, she ties one end of a thread round the finger of her dead husband and the other end round her own. The breaking of the thread is a sign of her breaking with the younger brothers of the deceased\" a). The food of the people consists of roasted barley-meal, fresh or dried herbs, and mea~, which is either raw or slightly roasted. They never visit without offering a present, no letter even is sent without its attending gift. The host on the other hand must offer his guest food and drink as frequently as possible. He who wishes to plead his cause before the king must accompany his petition by 1) Drew, p. 248. Monserrate also knew of this peculiarity. He writes of the inhabi-tants of Bhot, \"qui lanae coagmentum, quale est petasorum, corpori quam proxime possunt, suendo annectunt; nee ante exuunt, quam aut putrescat sudore, aut usu teratur et solvatur ut decidat.\" Monserrate, p. 594. 1) A7evedo, MS. fol. 31.

The king, on his part, offers the plaintiff food, and it would be rude not to take home any remains that should be left. The brief remarks on the religion and the lamas, with which Azevedo concludes, need not detain us here; they do not go beyond Andrade's statements, or else they are to be found at greater length in Desideri's narrative 1). The forlorn state in which he found the much-tried Christian community at Tsaparang soon convinced Azevedo that ordinary measures would not suffice and he resolved to take a bold step. It was impossible to do anything here,for the new governor,appoint-ed by the king of Ladakh, who had returned to Leh taking with him the late king and leaving a garrison in the town, was very hostile to the mission; so Azevedo made up his mind to go to Leh and treat personally with the king. But fresh obstacles arose. Small-pox had appeared at Tsaparang, and fearing that the travellers might carry the scourge to Leh the governor refused the required permit. Some presents, however, soothed his fears and he cons~nted. The missionary had hardly been three daysonhisway, however, when he was overtaken by an order to return at once on pain of death. He obeyed extremely vexed that the favourable season, which had advanced well into September, thus threatened to slip by. On September 28, however, he was suddenly informed that in a few days he would be allowed to start together with some horse-merchants of Utsang. Among the missionaries present he chose Oliveira as his companion and interpreter, and on Octo-ber4, 1631, the caravan took the road to Leh 2). Before chronicling in detail the particular events Azevedo first gives us some general information about this journey from Tsapa-rang to Leh, the first undertaken by any European. The journey took twenty-one days, travelling from sunrise to sunset. The route is little frequented and runs through snow-covered mountains. Not a green leaf or plant is to be seen, but there is much snow and an abundance of wild animals such as hares, mountain-goats, don-keys, hyacas (yaks?) wood-pigeons, big ravens, eagles &c. 3), the 1) What Azevedo has to say about the disgusting amulets and medicines (MS. fol. 32.

These remarks at once show that the travellers did not, as might at first be expected, take the road towards the valley of the Indus and thus drop down into Leh, the reason of which may with some probability be conjectured. As Schlagintweit remarks, the valley of the Indus in Ladakh from the frontier of the province of Gnari Khorsum onward is hardly available for the purposes of com-mercial intercourse especially on account of the presence of narrow and deep gorges, which force the traveller first to climb the steep slopes of the valley carved out by the river and then to traverse the difficult cross-valleys 2). For a caravan of horses such a road presents, of course, almost insuperable difficulties. But even the road they actually took must have been far from easy as is borne out by a comparison of the number of travelling-days and the distance between the two termini, which in a straight line is 360 kilometers. Besides the unavoidable delay attendant on the movement of a large caravan it is especially the season of the year and the condition of the ground, more particularly the latter, not described with any detail by Azevedo, which tell in these mat~ers. The track led across the plateau situated between the Zaskar and Ladakh ranges, which reaches an average elevation of 4,500 metres and is of a very irregular and rugged character. Captain Rawling, who from Gartok explored the basin of the upper Sutlej, supplies the description which is wanting in Azevedo. He argues at length that this plateau must at one time have been an enormous inland-sea, which was silted up with the debris of surrounding mountains forcing the water thus pressed for room to break through the Hi-malaya, and then continues: \"Since then rain and snow have con-tinued the work of wearing away the softened lines in the strata and forming great clefts and chasms many hundreds of feet in depth, to the bottoms of which the rays of the sun never reach. Narrow, precipitous ridges, spire-like pinnacles and isolated pla-teaux rise on all sides. It is a weird and wonderful sight, but also a depressing one, for neither shrubs nor grass can grow and a death-like silen_ce reigns supreme. Now and again, in the centre of the largest nullahs, a small crystal stream may be seen trickling over its sandy bed, but during the winter these are few and far between\"3). 1) R.

On the summit is a fortification with some cottages around it; a beautiful river passes close by 1). This can hardly be anything else than the pre-sent Shangtse, a settlement at an altitude of nearly 4,200 metres, 40 kilometres north of Tsaparang, on one of the tributaries of the Sutlej. As it is difficult to believe, however, that the whole of this distance was covered in one day, it is probable that the caravan was formed not in the town itself but at some distance from it on the other side of the river, and set out from this starting-point. The curious custom of living in caves, which Azevedo also notices at Tsaparang, is still in favour in the Sutlej basin. \"The inha-bitants are very partial to living in caves, and although houses are to be found, yet these caves are by far the most popular resi-dences\" 2). The second halting-place was another small town on a river-perhaps Ragbyaling on H. Strachey's map 3) or else T~oktse visited by Dr. Hedin') -the third was a shepherds' encamp-ment, without any further specification. Meanwhile the winter made its approach felt, for during the third night the cold became more severe and in the morning there was a foot of snow. \"The next seven days wetra versed great mountain ranges deeply covered with snow, a desert region without any settlement, till at last we reached Alner, where the chief of the lamas lives on the top of a mountain. It consists of only six or seven small houses, which form something like a fortification 6).\" Though the name of Alner does not occur on the maps, it may almost with certainty be identi-fied with Hanle in the extreme south-eastern comer of the present territory of the Maharajah of Kashmir, for Azevedo's par-ticulars clearly point to a Buddhist monastery, and from the fact that the caravan remained south of the Indus, they must neces-1) Azevedo, MS. fol. 34.

Besides, Hanle lies on the ordinary route to Leh. Thomas Thom-son, who visited it in 1847, found there \"a Buddhist monastery inhabited by about twenty lamas, built on the summit of a steep hill, which rises abruptly out ofthe plain\". Except the monks there was no settled population; a few stone huts without roofs, which were scattered about the foot of the rock, were untenanted 1). It is one of the highest inhabited spots on earth 2). Probably, therefore, Alner is a misspelling or rather a mishearing for' Anler' if indeed the place did not go by both names. From Hanle the caravan pursued its way across the bare pla-teau and through the more sheltered valleys, and soon came upon a shepherds' camp consisting of some thirty tents.

The nomads provided Azevedo with milk, not in exchange for money, with the use of which these solitaries were unacquainted, but for three raisins of the size of plums, which the Father had brought with him from Hindustan. They were so keen on them that th~·ee shepherds had to share one fruit! The next three days, again through barren and lonely mountains, were very trying for the two Europeans. They were half dead with cold, says Azevedo, his face and hands were all chapped and the blood ran down them, whilst his feet were also very sore. Oliveira, too, though he had passed some years in the climate, had much to suffer. Even the guides could not bear up and were quite disheartened. Fire-wood was nowhere to be found, nor even dung, the ordinary fuel in those parts. Towards the evening of the third day a wide valley opened out before them, in which was a large salt marsh {hua grande ma-rinha) with beautiful white salt. After stopping here for the night to rest as best they could, they resumed their journey through the inhospitable mountains the following day; another terrible three days' march brought them to the town of Guiar 3).

So we shall leave him for a while at Gya. When Thomson had visited Hanle, he first went some distance through the Indus valley leaving it at Puga, a stopping-place some fifty miles north-west of Hanle. Here he turned to the left and struck the direct road from Hanle to Gya. From this point on-ward, therefore, his route coincides with Azevedo's. It led him across the Pulolanka La, 16,500 feet (5,016 metres) high, a deep depression in the Ladakh range, in the district of Rupshu, and then to the banks of the Thogji Chumo, which had already been visited in 1822 by Trebeck, Moorcroft's travelling-companion 1}. \"After reaching the banks of the lake,\" Thomson writes, \"the road kept its eastern shore throughout its whole length, which was about three miles, and we encamped close to its north end on the edge of a level salt plain. Our elevation was about 15,500 feet. The margins of the lake, which was intensely saline, were generally very shallow, and its banks often swampy and cover~d with saline plan~s\" 2). That Azevedo's \"large salt marsh\" must be the Thoghi lake seems to be beyond dispute, and is borne out still more clearly by Drew's description of this Salt Lake Valley as he calls it. \"This is the widest opening in the whole of Rupshu; the length, in a direc-tion north-west and south-south-east, is thirteen miles, and along a considerable part of that length the valley is five miles wide; the level of it is 14,900 feet. It is a flat surrounded by hills, occupied partly by land and partly by water. The original outlet-an opening between the hills on the northwest-is now filled up some 70 feet above the plain, so tha tthere is no passage for the waters that collect in the valley, which therefore with its enclosing hills forms a separate drainage-basin. The hills are for the most part low in comparison with the mountains we have met with, all are bare of visible vegetation; as arule they are not rugged, but have smooth surfaces of loosened stones. The surface of the plain is varied; in 1) Moorcroft, II, 47.

It is obvious that the cold in these high valleys must necessarily be extremely severe, and with a clear sky there is a night-frost even in midsummer. The same writer draws attention to another influence which renders travelling in those high altitudes extremely painful, and which must have greatly aggravated the difficulties of the journey for Azevedo, who had only passed a couple of months in the Tibetan highlands. \"There is one charac-teristic of Rupshu that is always making itself felt by those who are used to dwell at lower altitudes. This is the rarity of the air. In the valleys water boils at about the temperature of about 187° [86° C], which corresponds to a barometer height of 17'8 inches [449 millimetres]. Hence the amount of air-and of oxygen-taken into the lungs with an ordinary inhalation is only 7/11ths of what would enter them where one at the level of the sea\"\"). From the Thoghi lake or Tso Kar: the road to Gya runs in the direction of the Tunglung pass parallel with the axis of the La-dakh range, alternately topping its spurs or dipping down into the valleys between them. Thomson, who traversed this part towards the end of September, found the ascent very steep. \"The road was very stony and rugged. . . . The wind still blew very strongly from the north, driving in our faces the still falling snow and opposing our progress towards the crest, which was very rocky, being composed of a mass of stratified quartz. The eleva-· tion of the summit was about 17,500 feet (5,320 metres). 8). No wonder the Portuguese traveller had something to say of the ter-rors of this march. Then another fourteen miles through a narrow precipitous ravine widening out a little towards the end, and the houses of Gya, the first after Hanle, were in sight. A hundred and ninety years were to elapse between Azevedo and Oliveira's passing visit and the arrival in 1820 of two other 1) Drew, p. 292. 1) Drew, p. 290. 1) Thomson, p. 175.

They describe Gya as \"a town of small extent and thinly peopled\" 1}, whilst Drew speaks of it as a village of some forty houses with a proportionately wide area of cultivation 2). It is situated at about 13,500 feet {4,115 metres) above sea-level. At the time of the visit of the two Portuguese town and country were governed by a ruler \"whom the king of Ladac had deprived of the kingdom of Mariul. He is very friendly with us, as he proved before, when he received Father Andrade.\" They, too, met with a kind reception, and among other presents received a dozen big apples, much resembling the very large and good ones of Lisbon, which, Azevedo adds, \"I had not seen during the last thirty-seven years\" 3). That fruit is grown in the severe Tibetan climate is known; apricots and peaches are even among the staple articles of export from Ladakh; apple-trees are numerous and of several kinds. \"They bear freely,\" writes Moorcroft, \"endure great cold and intense heat, require little rain and are very rarely attacked by disease\" 4). He, too, was presented with some apples at Marsi-lan~; half-way between Gya and Leh. With fresh energy Azevedo continued his journey. \"After two days we arrived at a station in the kingdom of Ladac, from where six small hamlets can be seen among the mountains at a mile's distance from each other and resembling those spoken of before. They lie in the greatest and longest valley which I have seen in those mountain regions and which also contains many fertile bar-ley-fields. This barley is not like that of our country, its grain resembles more that of wheat, and as food it is very nourishing and pleasant to the taste. The next day we reached the royal town of Lee\" 5). The course of the Gya or Mandur river points the way from Gya to the Indus valley, which, therefore, was the route followed by Moorcroft and many after him.

It took Moorcroft and Thomson two days to traverse, which agrees with Azevedo's time-notice. But what are the six hamlets seen by the latter near U pshi, \"the first station in the king-dom ofLadac \",it is hard to say. Thomson came across no settle-ments in the ten miles between Upshi and Marsilang in the direc-tion of Leh. On nearing Upshi, however, the Gya ravine widens out according to the same traveller \"into an open plain, well covered with houses and enclosures, with scattered poplar and willow trees .... and traversed by irrigation canals conducted from the little Gyarivulet\" 1}. May not Azevedo have meant this valley? Towards the evening of October 25, 1631, then, the first Euro-peans entered the capital of Ladakh. Not, however, without going through the necessary formalities. When they came near the town etiquette required them to light from their horses and standing to await the permission to enter. On receiving it they were by the king's orders assigned a. residence and provided with the necessary fuel, water and some measures of barley. Azevedo devotes only a few lines to the description of Leh. \"It is built on the slope uf a small mountain and numbers about 800 families. Half a mile lower down but still quite visible flows the river that goes to Lahore. By the town itself passes a mountain stream which works a large number of water-mills; a few trees are also found here\" 11). As we shall have to return to Leh in company with Desideri we shall not enter on a description of the town here. Let it suffice to remark that, if Azevedo's figures are correct, the population has rather diminished than increased; in 1847 Thomson was informed that it was 5,000, at present it must be about 2,100 8). Schlagintweit on his visit saw the water-mills on the Leh river\" '). The boundaries of Ladakh are thus given by Azevedo: \"The kingdom of Ladac borders in the south on that of Chaparangue or Goge [Guge], in the east on the kingdom of the three Moors, also called by another name Archande [Y arkand], the capital of which is Cascar [Kashgar]. It is from there that caravans carry into Chi-na the clay of which porcelain is made. Through this kingdom with 1) Thomson, p. 178. •) Azevedo, MS. fol. 36.

Cascar is not more than six days' march from the kingdom of Ladac. On the western side, finally, it is bounded by the kingdom of Baldys [Baltistan], a people which is not so white but of better physique and taller stature.\" 1) The very first day after their arrival the king had the strangers sent for \"less to see us personally than to receive our presents\", Azevedo adds slyly. The presents consisted of some pieces of cloth, six large and small fire-arms, two Chinese targets, an inkstand from Diu and some other gilt trinkets, all of which were eagerly welcomed an<l accepted. With great accuracy of detail Azevedo describes his first audience with Senge-nam Gyal. \"He is a man of tall stature, of a brown colour, with something of the Javanese in his features 2), and of stern appearance. He wore a rather dirty upper garment of some red material, a mantle of the same, and a thread-bar'\"e cap. His hair hung down to his shoulders, either ear was adorned with turquoise and a large coral, whilst he wore a string of skull-bones round his neck to remind himself of death. He was sitting cross-legged on an ornamental carpet of crimson velvet of the time of Mathusala.\" The queen, a short stout personage with sore eyes, was dressed like her husband but she was less imposing. When everyone was seated Chinese tea was served, a sign of great favour on their part. This tea is made with water, some butter and a little milk, it is a dark liquid, which is drunk as hot as possible. One who serves tea freely is reputed a very generous host, but on account of the cost only the rich can afford to do so. After this they were presented with a piece of raw meat and a ball of husked barley, which they call 'zanem'. After the interview most of those present saw them to their residence 3). Tea is, indeed, still a favourite drink in Ladakh, but the poor people, that is, Drew adds 4), nearly all the population, are rarely able to get it. Barley-meal is the people's daily food; it is, Father Donsen says, either baked into a sort of pancake, or made into dough and rolled into balls for more convenient carriage when travelling 5).

This does not render it probable that Senge-nam Gyal had already built his palace of nine stories, the construction of which is ascribed to him by the Ladakh chronicles 1}. During this first audience, which had been more of the nature of a formal greeting, Azevedo had not touched on the subject of his coming. Four days later, however, he thought he saw his chance and during a second interview he submitted his proposals. The king promised he would consider the matter with his councillors. A week later, the journal says, he sent us his decision; it was a firman authorizing us to continue to work as we had done during the reign of the late king, not only in the kingdom of Coge, but al-so in Ridocho and even in his own capital. He did not give us this answer personally that he might not be thought to bind himself to favour and expense, if we should actually settle at Lee. At the same time he presented us with a horse very much like Don Quixote's, four pieces of woollen stuff, two tails of hyacas (yaks?) together with-the permission to depart 2). As a long stay at Leh had never been intended and Azevedo was anxious to return to India to report, the two Fathers resolved to set out the next day, although the cold was already intense. In three days they were back again at Gya with the late king of Ma-riul. It was November 10. Here they took counsel, and, probably on the advice of the rajah, Azevedo changed the plan of his jour-ney. The cold was already very severe, he relates, and the eighteen stages separating G.ya from Tsaparang did not tempt him at all. He would, moreover, have to traverse the Mana pass in Decem-ber, which, if not impossible, could at any rate not be done with-out imminent danger of life. \"But if I took the direct road to La-hore, it woUld, it is true, be a new route across uninhabited regions and through many little kingdoms, but it had this great advantage that we should thus escape the terrible winter in nine days.

One cannot but admire the undaunted courage of those two Portuguese priests, who insufficiently equipped and provided with but few aids dared undertake in the unfavourable and late season a journey across the uninhabited pla-teaux of Rupshu and Lahul and through the dangerous Himalaya passes. For centuries the trade-route from Yarkand via Leh to the Punjab has run and still runs across the mountain districts of Rupshu, Lahul and Kulu. As late as 1868 the British government opened an annual fair at Palampur in the centre of the Kangra tea-district in order to attract the Turkestan 'and Leh traders. But the irregular arrival of theY arkand caravans at Leh and especially the fact of the market being held in autumn, which prevented those attending it from returning before the winter, militated against its bdng a permanent success, and it was abolished in 1879 1). Though the route is regularly used by the native population, it remained closed to Europeans for many years after Azevedo had traversed it. No account of his journey has ever been published and it was not till 190 years later that Moorcroft and Trebeck starting from India penetrated into those mountainous solitudes. Though in summer this route may not be very arduous, and entails nothing beyond the usual labour attendant on a mountain journey and the hardship resulting from scarcity of food and fuel, things are far otherwise in winter. The temperature remains below freezing-point, the· snowstorm sweeps the valleys, obstructs the passes and shrouds the roads; the snowfall begins in November, and till the beginning, often till the end, of May all the Himalaya passes at 16,000 feet - which is about the height of Mont Blanc -are practically inaccessible 2). No wonder, therefore, that the travellers were several times in danger of life. \"For nine days we travelled through a solitude of plateaux and mountain ranges without meeting a soul. Crossing frozen mountain streams and rivers we arrived in those parts where from the mountains issue a great number of springs, the water of which freezes immediately on 1) Drew, p. 536. 1) Schlagintweit, Ill, 224."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"112 FRANCISCO DE AZEVEDO coming out. I saw one mountain on the slope of which within the distance of a gunshot I counted 127 springs, but not a blade of grass was to be seen on the whole mountain. The greatest diffi-culty we experienced in these wastes was when we climbed and descended a very steep mountain wholly covered with snow and in some places with ice. It took us a whole day the snow reaching above our knees; no road was visible and our advance was nothing but a series of falls and rises and slippings on the ice, on which it was difficult to retain or regain a footing. Thank God there was plenty of sunshine and no wind that day, otherwise we should have been frozen to death. On the top of this great mountain the snow forms a pool in which two hundred boats might easily move; at the moment, however, it was one huge sheet of ice glitter-ing in the sun with a brilliance that blinded the eye\" 1). Knowing that Azevedo followed the traqe-route from Lehto the Punjab these details allow us to form a sufficiently accurate pic-ture of his journey. From Gya, his starting point, the road led him back along rising ground to the Tunglung or Takelung pass. Thence one may either drop directly into the north-south ·;alley of the Zarra, a feeder of the Zanskar, and then pass into that of the Sumkiel, or one may take the direction of the Salt Lake Valley, and striking out to the south before reaching it, enter the Sum-kiel basin through the valley of Rukchin. Both routes, of which the last-mentioned is the more common, finally abut on the La-chalung pass, leading on to the Bara-Lacha pass on the frontier of Lahul. Schlagintweit puts the elevation of the Lachalung pass at 16,750 feet (5,092 metres)2).The slope on theLahulside is described by Moorcroft as very steep, and the road on the side of Rup-shu is \"a rough, undulating ground intersected by rivulets and watercourses\" 3). The mountain so rich in springs mentioned by Azevedo may.be theLachalung, whose pass he must have traversed; in any case it cannot be the Bara-Lacha, which must ha·.re been the mountain that caused him so much trouble in climbing, as appears from the sequel of the narrative and the mention of the frozen mountain lake. No such lake is spoken of in the description of the passes in Rupshu, but it is given in that of the Bara-Lacha 1) Azevedo, MS. fol. 37. Appendix I. 1) Schlagintweit, III, 227.

Schlagintweit mentions the Nam Tso on the south-western slope at 15,570 feet 1); Drew has such a lake on his map but calls it Suraj Dal, from which issues one of the tributaries of the Bhaga river. That Azevedo took a whole day crossing the pass will cause no surprise if due account is taken of the season and the altitude. Though the height is differently stated, it is certainly above 4,860 metres 2). Two days after this crossing, just as they were marching through a valley (the Bhaga valley), an icy storm, which all day long blew in their faces, threatPned to freeze him to death. Quite numbed he had to be lifted from his horse to be revived. In the evening they encamped in a cave by-a frozen mountain stream, where they sat over a fire and partook of their scanty provisions: a few pieces of black bran-bread, \"blacker than the blackest bread that is to be found,\" and some barley-meal porridge. Their sufferings, how-ever, were for the present all but over, for the next day, the ninth after their departure from Gya, the cold was less severe and the limits of the lonely wastes were reached. Towards eleven o'clock they saw in the distance four cypress trees on the bank of the river, and continuing their way they came across moretreesandnu-merous clear springs, until towards four o'clock they entered the first settlement in the little kingdom of Carj a or Caria. In the house of a lama the travellers were treated to toasted bread and milk, the dainties of these people. The next morning the journey was resumed in the direction of the kingdom oi Culu, to which that of Caria is subjects). The first settlement, so all travellers tell us, which one meets on the way from Gya to Kulu is the hamlet of Darcha in Lahul. In the list of the stages from Leh to Palampur given by Drew it is theninthstopping-place after Gya ').\"It may be observed,\" Cun-ningham writes, \"that the whole of the country from Darcha in Lahul to the Chumureri Lake [in Rupshu] is a vast uninhabited desert, without a single tree or even a bush knee high, and but scantily supplied with water\" 5).

These details square so exactly with the points mentioned by Azevedo that there need be no doubt about the identity of \"the first settlement in the little kingdom of Carja\" and the hamlet of Darcha. But what about the name of Carja, which is not found on any map? Perhaps we mayhaveto think of some mutilated form of Gara as the valley of the Bhaga is locally called in Lahul 2). Darcha itself is situated on the Bhaga river, which flows through Lahul in a north-westerly direction and joins the Chandra at Tandi to form the important Chenab river. As regards the country itself, \"the climate of Lahul\", Harcourt writes, \"may be considered a very dry and bracing one, but towards the sources of the Bhaga and the Chundra the winds are bitterly cold blowing like a hurricane ~ day and subsiding altogether at night. In September the winter frosts set in, and from the end of December till April the entire country is covered with snow and almost completely shut out from the rest of the world\" 3). The vegetation, not nearly so luxuriant as in the district of Kulu, is almost confined within the limits of the valley. Besides rich· pas-tures some pines and willows are met with here and there. Barley and buckwheat are the chief crops, wheat being much rarer'). The people, not very numerous, still clearly betray their Mongo-lian origin and live for the greater part in small settlements not only on the lower Chandra but also in the Bhaga valley. When Moorcroft went up this valley from Barling, north of Mundi, he passed an·day long through a succession of villages \"each contain-ing from ten to twenty houses\" li). All these characteristics are mentioned in Azevedo's notes. Starting from their first resting-place, so he informs us, in the direction of Kulu, the road ran be-tween two mountain ranges covered with trees and vegetation. They passed through several small villages, the people of which gained their living by agriculture and cattle-breeding.

The lateness of the season caused fresh difficulties. On the frontier of Lahul the snowfall began to be so heavy that the travellers were continually losing their way. Soaked to the skin and numbed with cold they reached the foot of a mountain, where they had to pass the night in the shelter of a cave. The prospect of having to climb the pass the next day under such circumstances seemed anything but tempting to Azevedo, the more so as his boots, which were never meant for such mountaineering feats, had succumbed in the struggle. But their rest was protracted for two more days as the snowfall during the night was so heavy that even the natives dared not venture on the passage. In the early morning of the third day the ascent was begun with the aid of some Lahulis. Azevedo had obtained from them a pair of shoes of twisted straw, such as Schlagintweit still saw in use among the Ladakhis 2). The horses sank into the snow up to their bellies. \"I shoved myself along with the greatest difficulty without being able to take any rest, for if I stopped for a moment I sank into the snow up to my chest.\" For five hours he struggled on but then his strength failed him before the top was reached. He thought he would die on the spot, and it was only through the efficient assistance of his companions, who had to carry him in their arms, that he was enabled to continue the journey. As they could not get to the foot of the pass before nightfall they bivouacked on the slope, whence the exhausted travellers looked down with admiration and longing on the magnificent cedar trees in the valley beneath 3). Though this Rotang pass, 13,500 feet high and connecting La-hul and Kulu, is neither difficult nor dangerous, yet the crossing may be attempted under circumstances which entail the loss of human life. Thus Harcourt narrates that in 1863 of a hundred labourers who traversed it duringastormseventy•twoperished\").

The road took them along flourishing villages and fertile fields. The town is situated in a mountain-valley intersected by many rivulets and adorned with an abundance of splendid cedars. The population is very nu-merous and the houses at'e very comfortable. They are built of hewn stone, whilst the verandahs they have running round the four sides are, like the roofs, made of cedar wood. They are a people with fine features, the children with their golden hair are very charming, and some of the women are as white as those of Portu-gal. It is a curious custom there for everyone to wear flowers or odoriferous herbs in their head-gear. Azevedo was less pleased, when with smooth talk he was relieved of a horse and a few other little items by a kinsman ofthe king's, who for the resf had received him well during the absence of the latter. \"But I let things be, that I might obtain permission to continue my journey\" 8).

To him this meant a possible new mission-field, and he wrote to India suggesting that the attempt to reach those more easterly territories should be made from Bengal2). Though some few published records have made it sufficiently clear that this advice was acted upon 3), and that two mis-sionaries, Fathers Stephan Cacella and John Cabral ventured upon a journey to Utsang, the meagre details of those records and the lack of first-hand evidence have hitherto rendered a full description of the expedition impossible. For the purpose of the reconstruction attempted in the present chapter the author has availed himself of a number of unpublished documents, letters and reports, all in the possession of the Society of Jesus.

This document must have been in Portugal and perhaps in Rome before 1635, in which year De Queyros left for India, but all my inquiries have failed to brlng it to light again. Of the earlier life of the two missionaries very little is known. Stephen Cacella was born at A viz in the diocese of Evora, became a Jesuit at the age of nineteen and sailed for India in 1614. On completing his studies he was at least for some years stationed in Cochin 4). The companion of his Tibetan journey, John Cabral, was his junior by fourteen years; a native of Celorico in the province of Beira, he had joined the Society of Jesus in 1615 and went out to India in ~624 5). Of the two provinces which divided between them the vast Jesuit mission in India, that of Malabar served Bengal, and as this country had been suggested as the starting-base, it was natural that this province should undertake the expedition. On April 30, 1626, the two travellers set out from Cochin together 1) The second and third letters are printed a the end of the book as Appendix II & III. 2) Chapter IV, p. 101. Cf.

Their first object was the present town of Hugli 2) situated on a branch of the Ganges-delta, where the mission had an establishment, and where information for the further journey could be gathered. They were very sanguine at what they were told, Cacella writes in his first letter, July 10, 1626, to Father Albert Laertius at Cochin. The road to Cathay is much frequented and offers no serious hin-drances, whilst the people are said to behave as if they were Chris-tians. He will, therefore, go to Cocho by Siripur, where he hopes to meet the Cathayans and to join them on their return to their coun-try in October. He will write again from Cocho. This he actually did, as is borne out by his message of October 4, 1627 1), though the letter itself has not been preserved; fortunately, however, the October message repeats briefly the contents of his former letter supplemented by some other items, a chronological summary therefore, which may be quoted here to give a general idea of the undertaking. \"On August 2, 1626, we left Go lim [H ugli] and arrived at Dacca on the 12th. We set out again on September 5 and on the 26th of the same month we reached Azo and Pando, where we stayed for a few days with Rajah Satargit. From Azo we moved on October 8 to Biar, which we entered on the 21st. Here we had to wait for four months before we could cross the mountain ranges, so it was not till February 2, 1627, that we took the road to Runate, the furthest of the dominions of Cocho, and on the 21st we entered the kingdom of Potente. On the 23rd we began the ascent of the mountains and after eighteen days' travelling, on April 10, we met the Droma Rajah, king and great Lamba of this realm. 1) This is the date given by the Littera Annua Provinciae Coccinensis anni z6:17, which at the hand of reports that have come in, treats of Cacella's undertaking at some length. Though on the one hand it is probable that Cord ora draws on this record, yet on the other hand he wrongly assigns the departure to the year 1627. The Littera Annua Prov. Cocc. anni z6:z6 mentions March 15, 1626, as the day of Cacella's departure. It would seem therefore that the exact date cannot be fixed. 1) Cacella and Cabral always write Gulim or Golim. The name is supposed to be derived from 'gola', a large warehouse of bamboo, erected by the Portuguese on the site of the present town in the second part of the sixteenth century; it should be noted, however, that even before 1600 Ralph Fitch writes 'Hugeli' (Fitch, p. 182); Bernier's spelling is Ogouli (p. 176, 439). 1) Appendix II, fol. I. -The Littera annua Prov. Cocc. anni z6:17 mentions a few details which are not found in the letter of October 4, 1627, and must have been drawn from this Cocho·letter.

After this brief survey he begins his circumstantial account. On their departure from Hugli it was deemed prudent to take measures to provide for the safety of the two travellers; for Dacca, the first object of this stage of their journey, was at the moment ruled over by the Mohammedans during the absence of the N ababo (Nawab) at Rajabol2). Disguised as Portuguese soldiers they trav-elled under the guidance of Father Simon de Figueiredo, who had some experience of Dacca. On their arrival at Siripur Cacella left his companions behind, and proceeded further, accompanied only by Figueiredo, in order to reconnoitre. Their apprehensions had not been at all unfounded. At Dacca the two travellers and their boat were seized at once. After twelve days, however, they were set free again, and Cacella sent the boat down to Siripur to fetch Cabral. In view of the difficulties to which the further jour-ney might give rise, Fonteboa, who was fifty years of age, was ordered to return to Hugli: he would be sent forassoonasthings had taken a favourable turn. But he had hardly reached Hugli when he fell ill and died on December 26; 1626 8). Continuing their way by water for three weeks the two passed some sixty 'choquis', a sort of custom-house, at each of which they had to pay toll. They were now at Azo. \"Azo is the most impor-tant town and the capital of the kingdom of Coc:b.o, a large coun-try, very populous and rich. It used to be the residence of Liqui-narane, king of Cocho, who is now dead, and theN ababo of Mogor, to whom tire country pays tribute, also resides there.

For a right understanding and just estimate of the particulars given by Cacella both here and in the sequel we must take a bird' s-eye-view of the contemporary history of Eastern Bengal. There are at the time two kingdoms, distinguished from each other as Koch Bihar (Cooch Behar) and Koch Hajo, from the names of their respective capitals2). At the beginning of the sixteenth cen-tury-many say in 1509, others in 1524-one Visu Sing became king of Cooch Behar, where he founded a beautiful town. He was succeeded by his son Nara Narayana, who extended his posses-sions in every direction, conquered the whole of Kamrup and made even the Rajah of Bhutan pay tribute. At the close of his life he divided his dominions giving the western half (Cooch Behar) as far as the Sankosh river to his son Laksmi Narayana, and the eastern half (Koch Hajo) to his nephew Raghu Rai. The division proved fatal to both parts. Laksmi Narayana very sooncamemto conflict with the mighty MogulEmperor Akbar, who conquered his kingdom and only left him to rule it as a tributary king. After his death in 1622 Bir Narayana came to the throne, but he died after five years and was succeeded by his son Pran Narayana in 1627. Raghu Ral, too, did not long enjoy his new dignity; he died in 1593 leaving his kingdom to his son Parikshit, who \"mounted cannon at Pandunath to the west of the Kamakhya hill [in Kam-rup] and built a town at North Gauhati, whose fortifications can still be traced for many miles even at the present day\" 8). He quar-relled with Laksmi Narayana, who, now a vassal of Akbar's, called in his liege-lord's help. Parikshit was defeated and fled. But the struggle was continued by Parikshit's brother, Bali Narayana (1614-1637), who found support with the savage Ahom king. The latter took Pando, a town near Gauhati, and besieged Hajo. Though he was repulsed from its walls the war dragged on with varying success in Lower Assam. 1) Appendix II, fol. 3. 2) Cf. Hunter, X, 405 ff.; Blochmann, p. 52 ff.; Allen, p. 26 ff.; E. A.

They begged an au-dience, presented their letters and declared their intention of pro-ceeding to Cathay. Therajahhadinquiries made among his people, but \"there was no one who had any knowledge of this country except a Moor, who told us that itlay beyond a town called Cascar [Kashgar], through which one passes into it. He knew of no road leading to it from Cocho, but we were sure to find one after cross-ing the mountains of Potente. When we wanted to know how we were to get to the kingdom of Potente, Satargit proposed that we should consult Liquinarane, king of Cocho, at Azo, who as ruler of the country knew more of it, and was well acquainted with that people, who came down into his country by several gates\" 1). This was resolved upon and Satargit insisted on conducting them per-sonallyto Azo. No wonder that Cacella is very generous in his praise of the helpfulness of the powerful commander, who, he says, \"through his knowledge and position stands very high throughout the -country, as we noted at Azo, where the people in the streets cheered him as if he was their sovereign. This was also in part owing to the great liberality with which he disposes of his income amounting to about 200,000 tangas\" 2). These particulars also serve to bring out the less honourable part which this high-placed personage played a few years later. It is thus briefly related by Blochmann from the Padishahnamah. \"Satrjit was the son of Mu-kindra, zamindar of Bosnah, which lies three stages from Dhaka [Dacca] 'on this side'. Shaikh 'Alauddin' when Governor of Ben-gal, had sent him along with the army which then invaded Hajo; and as he distinguished himself in the war, he had after the con-quest of the country and the return of the army been appointed Thanahdar of Pandu and Gauhatti, where chiefly through his nu-merous dependants he had obtained the friendship of the Assam-ese and had also, by his influence as zamindarofBosnah, become quite intimate with the chiefs of Koch. The governors of Ben-gal, who succeeded Shaikh' Alauddin, had often called him; but he made for ever excuses and neither paid his respects, nor did he send the customary perhkash\". The end was that finally he made common cause with Assam against his own sovereign, ') .tppendiz II, fol. 3. 2) Appendiz II, fol. 3."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"126 STEPHEN CACELLA AND JOHN CABRAL and in the subsequent war he was taken prisoner and executed 1). It was this Satrjit or Satargit, then, who in 1626 escorted the two missionaries to Azo, which is but another name for Hajo, in fact the usual one on older maps. Thus on theN ew Map of Bengal by Matthew van den Broucke and published by Fr. Valentijn the town of 'Azo' is given in the 'Kingdom of Cos Assam' 2). And much more recently on Dr. Griffith's map appended to the account of his Bhutan journey in 1837 we find the town of 'Azo', though in the text he and Captain Pemberton \"started from Hayoo\" 8). \"The beautiful river of Cocho\", on which the town was situated, is of course the Brahmaputra, which name, however, seems to have remained unknown to the travellers. At the present day Hajo is at some distance from the river, which must necessarily lead to the conclusion that the Brahmaputra has shifted its bed a good way southward, which is not very surprising in the case of a stream so turbulent and liable to incessant fluctuations 4). Cacella has no details about Hajo. In 1837 it was \"a picturesque place and one of considerable local note .... The village is a large one, and situated close to some low hills; it has the usual Bengal appearance, the houses being surrounded by · t:ees, such as betel palms, peepul, banyan and caoutchouc\" 6). Allen in his Gazetteer of Kamrup has nothing to say on the condition of Hajo, only mentioning the remains of an old mosque and a still existing temple of Vishnu restored by Raghu Rai in 1583 6). To gain access to the king the travellers had to pass through three courts enclosed by roomy verandahs and separated from each other by strong gates. They led into a large garden, in the middle of which stood a villa, where Liquinarane awaited them. After giving them a kindly hearing he advised them to take the road to Biar, where his son Gaburrasa ruled, and thence to pro-ceed to Potente through Runate, the furthest part of his domin-ions.

On comparing Cacella's notes on Liquinarane, king of Cocho, with the data supplied by Blochmann, Gait and Hunter, he can only mean Bir Narayana, king of Cooch Behar, because after Bali Narayana's flight to Assam the part of the country where Cacella was had not a king of its own. Moreover, Bir Narayana we know reigned only for five years and died in 1627 2), and Cacella writing on October 4, 1627, of his audience with Liquinarane in 1626, says that he \"is now dead\" 3). Bir's successor was his son Pran. Setting out for Biar on October 8, Cacella and Cabral arrived there on the 21st. They were not the first Europeans to enter the territory of Cooch Behar, for as early as 1586 it had been visited by the London merchant, Master Ralph Fitch. \"I went from Ben-gala\", the latter says \"into the countrie of Couche, which lieth five and twenty dayes journey Northwards from Tanda.

The town of Biar is described by Cacella with a fair amount of detail. It \"is situated on the river 7) and extends so wide in a very pleasant region that in length and breadth it measures several leagues. The low buildings, which are very much like those of the other kingdoms of Bengal, offer nothing that is striking.

There are many bazaars, in which is to be found everything that is produced in these parts. Biar is famous for Its fruit, which are better here than I have seen them in India, and especially for its oranges of every kind\" 1). On their arrival in the town, however, the king was not there. \"Disheartened by the many inundations which desolated his capital he had removed to the interior some weeks before and taken up his abode at a spot which before had been called Colambarim and which was situated on a tributary of the same river. The Biar merchants were so eager to please their king and to found the new town that on our arrival there it had already taken the lead of Biar in the regularity and size of its streets\" 2). The following description of the present capital is drawn by Hunter from Captain Lewin's Account of the Kuch Behar State (Kuch Behar 1876). \"Surrounded on three sides by two small streams, both called Torsha, which enlap the town in their sinuosi-ties, the site of Kuch Behar still recalls the days when the dr~ad of the Bhutias caused the position of a town to be chosen more with a view to defensive than to sanitary or commercial considerations. The town consists of a congeries of mud huts surrounding the brick mansion, which is by courtesy called the palace of the Kuch Behar Rajas. The trade is notlarge and the few Marwaris, who have their small brick houses in the hazar, confine their dealings for the most part to export traffic. The small rivers above mentioned which pass near the town are only navigable for boats during the rainy season, and con~equently at other times there is no communica-tion with Bengal, save by road. The palace is a brick building, dating from the year 1828\" 3). This description evidently does not in all points tally with Cacella's, and since even the excellent District Gazetteers fail to provide a complete account of the minutiae of topography, I applied to Babu Harendra Narayan Chaudhuri, the author of The Cooch Behar State and its Land Revenue Settlements, the best 1) Appendix II, fol. 4.

After comparing Cacella's notes with the past and present state of the district he was so kind as to supply me with the following answer. \"The Torsa on which the present town of Cooch Behar stands did not at the time of the traveller's visit in 1626 occupy the positions indicated in Captain Lewin's Account of the Gooch Behar State, but flowed further west, and was of much larger dimensions than now or in Lewin'stime. The description of the surrounding country as given by Cacella is still applicable to the existing state of things to a large extent. The country around is smiling and boats of burden frequent the river even now. The river trade carried on by the Torsa was consider-able in former days; up-country boats from districts lying higher up on the Ganges used to come up to the capital and go even fur-ther up two generations ago. Captain Lewin was in Cooch Behar at a time when both the channels of the river had almost dwindled • into small streams. There is ample evidence furnished by the dried beds and marshes which lie all over the country about the town of Cooch Behar that the Torsa was at one time a powerful river and t>ccupied successive positions over a large tract.\" A royal change of residence, such as is mentioned by Cacella, is not at all rare in the history of this Indian State 1). Thus Bir Na-rayana {1621-1625) removed his capital to Atharakotha and also had a residence at Mandahawasha. Later on Rup Narayana (1693 -1714) moved the capital from Atharakotha to Guriahati on the eastern bank of the Torsa. The site then occupied froms part of the present Cooch Behar Town 2). The removal to Colambarim, however, is nowhere spoken of and the place itself is not to be found in any map. One peculiarity might perhaps be interpreted to point to a place not far away, namely the fact that Cacellagener-ally very accurate in timing his journeys omits all mention oftime in the present instance. But then, which is the exact spot? For an answer to this question I have to thank the same kind correspon-dent. \"The town ofCoochBehar,\" he writes, \"has occupied approx-imately the same position as it does now from a long time past. Of course, the king of the country moved his residence now and then, but in so doing the neighbourhood was not left altogether and the old capital does never appear to have been fully aban-doned.

The place spoken of in the MS., Colambarim, is very near the present town and can be none other than Kalahari Ghat 1), which has given the name to a Taluk of the State and below which the Torsa flowed at one time. Both Kalahari Ghat and Guriahati were on the same side of the river and lay only about a couple of miles apart. Atha-rakotha, too, is -not for from the present town; so also is Dhalia-bari 1). These places like some others formed the principal seat of Government for some time. All these sites are almost contiguously situated, and occupy different positions in a tract of country about twenty square miles in area, near and about the present town of Cooch Behar. In this connection it may be borne in mind that\" the name Cooch Behar is of a comparatively recent date, Behar or Nij Behar being the older appellation.'' Owing to the letters of the king Liquinarane and of Satrjit they were well received at Colambarim, so that they were soon a\"Qle to depart to Runate, which as we saw above, formed the Cocho border-territory towards Potente. On their arrival they met eight natives of that country, and the travellers, of course, were very eager to gather what information they could. They were not a little disappointed, however, to learn that at this season, there was no possibility of crossing the mountains on account of the snow, wind and rain, and however much they insisted, the men could not be prevailed upon to try the passage; so they were obliged to wait for four months in the kingdom of Cocho 3). There was nothing forit then but to return to Biar, whence they 1) Ghat -landing-place along a river.

This man spoke with three hill-men, who offered goods for sale and who promised to conduct Cacella to the capital of Cathay (in regiam Cathay clvitatem). These men were called Bottias and their country, which is very large, Botenti, or as Andrade writes Potenti. A town called Chaparanga, in which Father de Andrade lived, was unknown to these men, but if he (Cacella) would but go to king DromarajA, the latter would certainly provide him with a guide. According to Cacella, the Letter goes on to say, no one knew a country called Tibet. A Persian whom he J;llet, thought that beyond the mountains there were two vast countries, one of which was called 0, the other Uturum.

The stay in the damp and malarious climate was any-thing but pleasant. Almost at the same time they were attacked by a violent fever and their boys were also taken ill. Cacella re-covered fairly quickly, but things began to look very black when Cabral and the servants boys grew so ill that for days they hovered between life and death, while everything was wanting for their proper attendance. November and December passed and Cabral was still ailing. But the time of departure being near Cacella went to take leave of Gaburrasa. The latter gave him letters for the governor of Runate and the people of Potente, and in token of his good-will he even presented him with a horse. He was very con-cerned about their departure especially \"because the Cochos are in great fear of those men on account of the unconcern with which they behave in Runate without fearing anybody\". During the whole of January they waited at Biar for the arrival of Fontebona and the interpreter, and at last on February 2, 1627, proceeded to Runate to get everything in readiness for the departure. Tired of waiting they had already made up their minds to do without an interpreter, however embarrassing it might prove to be, and to start on the 20th, when on the eve of their departure the long-expected one arrived from Hugli bringing the news of Fontebona's death. On Sunday February 21 they set out from the kingdom of Coach Behar 1). Of all these particulars there is not a word in the older works re ferrecl to at the beginning of this chapter. Cordara sums up the whole of the journey in the statement that the travellers had to encounter innumerable dangers which it would be too long tore-count 2). Barretto is almost equally laconic. After mentioning their embarking at Cochin for Bengal he continues: \"Thence they sailed up the Ganges and after long journeying they came to the king-dom of Coccia, which is situated at the foot of certain high moun-tains\" 3). The name Coccia had already suggested to W. Rees Philipps the conjecture, now proved to be correct, that Cooch Behar might be meant 4). 1) Appendix II, fol. 5. ') Cordara, II, 132: ..

Difficulties arose at once. For when at Runate, they had associated themselves with an important personage of Potente, who happened to be there on business. He had not gone with them, but had sent them on before together with his servants secretly charging the latter to retain the foreigners in the village till he should himself arrive. This was to be after six months! Accordingly the villagers refused to aid them in any way towards the continuance of their journey, so that the travellers found them selves practically prisoners. After spending twelve days in trying to come to terms Cacella grew tired of these insolent proceedings and resolved to act. Leaving Cabral behind he set out, undaunted by the most terrifying accounts of the dangers that awaited him and attended only by a Christian boy and two men of CochC' who had a smattering of the language. On his way he fell in with two soldiers, whom he joined, as they said they were going to the same country. But the next day when crossing a stream the two fellows together with the two Cochos robbed the missionary of all his pos-sessions. Left alone with his boy without a guide and having no knowledge of the language Cacella was forced to retrace his steps. This he did on a dark March night in the midst of a snow-storm which compelled him to creep on all fours along the narrow moun-tain paths. It was lucky then, he humorously remarks, that my fine travelling-companions had only left me my stick and my breviary to carry! On his return to the village he found that by adroit ma-noeuvring Cabral had made the people relinquish their hostile atti-tude, and that they were willing to help them on 1). Or was it that they counted on the impossibility of the two escaping them when they should have got further on their way? They set out on March 16 and along the ups and downs of the mountains they reached, after six days, another village called Rintam; here they found the first of the king's houses, and in it they were entertained. They were overtaken by a relative of the deceitful person with whom in Runate they had settled for their journey.

Just then the fields were covered with very promising crops of wheat and rice. Two rivers divide the plain, and lend it fresh-ness and beauty, especially through the large willow-trees and the many irrigation-canals that emanate from the rivers. The houses begin at the very edge of the plain, large, high buildings with very thick walls, generally of three, four and even.five stories, greatly beautified by windows and verandahs. These houses, however, do not line up into streets, rather they are sprinkled all over the plain and along the foot of the mountains. Thus they form a town of such length that the part of it which we saw and.traversed must be at least three leagues, and there still remained something to be seen. For the plain continues in the way I have said till it comes to a mountain ridge which splits it lengthwise, and from which on either side descend the streams that water it. The town creeps up these slopes in two large stretches, the ends of which pass a good way beyond the two rivers. The number of inhabitants cannot be cour,ted, and I estimate that there dwell there at least 500,000 souls. This is made possible by the way in which they live in the houses, because in each of them there are many inhabitants divided over the different stories and tenements. We arrived in this town on March 25\" 1). At the point they have now reached the travellers must be a good way within the borders of Bhutan. This is not only borne out by their line of route, which is from Coach Behar State northward through the mountains, but by the name of Potente, which is repeatedly used by Cacella. For Bod, or in Azevedo's spelling Pot 2), is the general name for Tibet, while Potent or Potente means 'the end of Pot'. \"Bhotan was so called by the Bengalis in the belief that it was the end of Bot\" 3). As far as the author is aware Cacella and Cabral were the first Europeans to penetrate into this mountain region which even to-day is little known.

The first, therefore, to follow the two missionaries were Bogle and Hamil-ton, who went through Bhutan when in 1777 they were charged by Warren Hastings with a mission to Tibet. Six years later they were followed by Turner and Saunders on a similar errand. Then Manning, Davis and Kishen Kant Bose stayed there for a short while, till in 1837 Pemberton and Griffith traversed the whole country from east to west. Like the others it was but a pass.:. ing visit. But as the Bhutanese never ceased to worry the border-districts of Bengal, Ashley Eden was sent as a political agent in 1863 to come to a settlement with the unruly mountaineers. Through the hostile attitude of the government the negociations miscarried and led to a war, which ended in Bhutan having to cede the so-called Bengal Duars, Owing to the thoughtful endeavours of Mr. J. C. White the relations between the two countries have of late years been greatly improved. Beyond the accounts and reports of these travellers we have practically no information about Bhu-tan, and it is to them, therefore, that we shall tum to check and elucidate Cacella's notes. The next point calling for discussion is, where did the two travellers cross the frontier? Satargit's remark about the people of Potente coming down into Cocho \"by several gates\" at once sug-gests the border-district of Bhutan, whence a series of defiles -the so-called Duars -lead down into Bengal. \"The Duars of Bhu-tan,\" Markham writes, \"-literally 'doors' or approaches-em-brace the strip of land extending along the foot of the Bhutan Mountains in Bengal and Assam, like the 'terai' or 'murung' of Sikkim and Nepal. There are eighteen of these duars or passes, eleven on the frontier of Bengal and seven on that of Assam .... Several streams and rivers flow over pebbly beds from the gorges the different defiles to the Brahmaputra.

As Cacella and Cabral set out from Cooch Behar, it isonlythe eleven passes on the frontier of Bhutan and Bengal that come in for consideration, the Assam Duars being ruled out by their geo-graphical position. As their starting-point is mentioned Runate or Reinate, and though the name is not to be found in any map, the place must have offered evident advantages to intending travel-lers, for the missionaries are at once directed tither by king Liqui-narane, and his son Gaburrasa is evidently unable to suggest a better place to start from. It is here that a remark of Father Desideri's, whose geographical work will form the snbject of a later chapter, occurred to the writer as it seemed to point to a possible solution of the problem. When treating of the Lhoba-tribes in Southern Tibet and Bhutan he writes: \"It is to be regretted that they permit no foreigner to pass through their territory. If they did, one would be able in a few days to go from Tibet to Rong-mati\" 2). And in another place he calls Rongmati a province of Mogol at the other side of the Ganges, into which the principal river of Tibet flows 8). If only Runate could be taken to be iden-tical with Rongmati we might not unreasonably fix on the present Rangamati in Bengal as the starting-point. When these conjec-tures were submitted to Babu Harendra Narayan Chaudhuri I was favoured with the following reply: \"The travellers of 1626 evident-ly went north from Behar and passed through Rangamati, which lies in the western Duars about twenty miles north-west of the modem sub-divisional town of Alipur Duar in the British District of Jalpaiguri. The place goes by the name of Rangamati Ioygaon. The whole of the western Duars formed part of the old Kingdom of Cooch Behar, and was finally lost after the second Bhutan war.'' By its situation Runate-Rangamati naturally points the way to Buxa Duar which, therefore, is most likely to have been the 'door' by which they ventured into the mountains as Bogle and Hamilton did after them in 1774. One circumstance only might be interpreted to indicate a more circuitous route, namely the fourteen days of actual travel, which seems to be rather long to 1) Markham, p. xxxvii. 1) Puini, p. 76. 1) Puini, p. tOO."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"136 STEPHEN CACELLA AND JOHN CABRAL cover the main-road of Rangamati-Pargao. The name of Rintam cannot help us here, as the place is neither mentioned by any later traveller, nor included among the hundreds of names given by the Bhutan Blue-book of 1865. It is the difficulty which Markham encount~red in discussing Manning's expedition, when he found it impossible to identify several places mentioned by the traveller for lack of adequate maps 1). Fortunately, however, we have a firm hold again in Pargao as it cannot be other than the present town of Para. Almost every one of the more ancient travellers has his own way of spelling this name 2), some of which run the Portuguese pronunciation of Pargao very dose. On comparing Cacella's won-derful picture of the town with the description of the Para valley by other travellers, by Ashley Eden for instance, who traversed those regions in February 1864, the identity appears to be beyond doubt. After describing the fort, which also serves as a palace, a five-storied building with a tower in its centre of some seven stories 3), Eden continues: \"About a quarter of a mile from the fort are the town and market-place. The town has about thirty good three-storied stone houses. The market-place is a large, open, stony square near the river. Every evening some two or three hundred collect here, but, as far as we could see, they never had anything to sell except walnuts, pears and radishes ....

The lower and level portion of the valley is richly cultivated with rice .... the higher portion of the valley grows a very fine, full-grained wheat and barley. We rode on one occasion down the valley some ten miles, nearly where the Parchoo [Pachu] joins the Thimpoo or Tchincho River [Chin-chu], along the bank of which is the Buxa Dooar roui:e, taken by Pemberton and Turner. The Paro valley is a perfectly level plain; \"l) ·Markham, p. 214, note 4. 1) Bogle's spelling is Parogaund (Markham, p. 62, 65), Turner's Parogong (Tur· ner, p. 177), Saunders's Paraghon (Turner, p. 397), Manning's Parojong (Markham, p. 215), Davis's Paragong (Davis, p. 513), Kant Bose's Paragangor Paragaon (Bose, p. 141, 146). 1) The bUilding was destroyed by fire in 1907."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"STEPHEN CACELLA AND JOHN CABRAL 137 to this point the road was an excellently made grassride along the river banks, with an avenue of weeping willows; both sides of the river are well studded with pretty villages ....

Just above the palace, the Parchoo is joined by another stream, which comes from a little valley to the north\" 1). Later accounts show beyond ques-tion thatCacella's estimate of the population is far too high even if every allowance is made for a possible falling off through polyan-dry, sickness, war and emigration. Eden and Austen estimated the population in 1864 at 3,000 souls 2). The visit of our Portuguese began most unpleasantly. The man who had shown himself so very obliging and had conducted them to tl!e town, locked them up in one of the houses, robbed them of all their equipment and finally told them that they were to remain prisoners till the person with whom they had treated at Runate should arrive. This was the second attempt to bully the two un-armt:d strangers; but yet again they had reckoned without their host. After two days, seeing that no strict guard was kept Cacella and Cabral walked out of their prison. At once a mob collected, Cacella stood firm; violence was threatened and weapons were raised, but he declared his resolution of going straight to the king. This intrepidity told on the people and at last even assured him the support and the company of the most influential lamas of the place, and on AprilS, Easter Monday, they were able to proceed. Cacella, at this stage, does not clearly divide off the different days of travel, but from the general outline of the journey premised to his account we know that he met the king on April1 0; the journey, therefore, took five days. The only reference to the character of the country is that the road led across fairly high mountains. The king was soon informed of their approach and bade them wel-come in four different ways. First, after three days, they were met by a lama bringing servants and horses for the further journey. Then came a second messenger with two horses beautifully capa-1) Blue-book, p. 213. Captain W.

A little further they were treated to tea, a favourite drink with the king and his attendants. And lastly there were sent to meet them a band of young lamas on horseback, who in their honour had horse-races in the plain. \"Immediately after this we discovered among the trees a large crowd of people waiting for us, and then there was a sound of clarions and trum-pets, for to these the musical instruments they use at feasts have some resemblance. A hundred young lamas, from twelve to twenty years of age, in double file came to welcome us, whilst three smaller ones walked in the middle carrying burning perfumes, which is a royal homage. Thus they conducted us to our lodging, a well-made tent lined with Chinese silk and adorned with a canopy. After a little while we were summoned into the king's presence and ushered into another tent also richly ornamented with silks. The king was seated on a raised seat draped with red silk and em-broidered with gold. Close to him on his right, on a similar plat-form, stood a statue of his father, in front of which a lamp always burnt. There were also two raised seats for us, whilst none of the lamas, however high in rank, had any seat except the mats•that covered the floor. The reception was very kind and in reply to the usual questions as to where we came from and who we were, I told him that we were \"Portuguese\" for the name of Franguis, by which the Portuguese are known throughout the East, was unknown to them, because foreigners never enter these mountain regions and no one could remember having ever seen or heard of their pas-sage\" 1). The conversation, however, continually floundered, because the interpreter they had brought with them, though he knew Persian, Hindustani and Cocho, did not understand the language of this country. It was kept up somehow through a lama of Tsaparang, who happened to be at the court and had some knowledge of Hin-dustani, and as the king was very anxious to converse with the strangers the lama was appointed their instructor and had to give them daily lessons in the language of the country. We are given a full portrait of the king. He-is called DromaRajah, is thirty-three years of age, and is at once king and great-lama of this realm of Cambirasi, which is the first of the kingdoms of Potente in this region, and is very large and populous. He enjoys great 1) Appemiix II, fol. 8."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"STEPHEN CACELLA AND JOHN CABRAL 139 regard for his gentleness, and not less for his abstinence from rice, flesh and fish, for he lives only on milk and fruits. At one time he passed three years in solitude living in a hut on a large projecting rock of a mountain without seeing or receiving anybody. With the aid of two ropes he drew up the necessary food to his inaccesible dwelling-place. He gave his time to prayer and in his leisure mo-ments he made some images, one of which he showed us, an image of the face of God (I mag em de vulto de Deos) carved in white sandal wood, small but excellently made. He was also very accomplished in the art of painting; when Cacella showed him a picture of the archangel Raphael, he wished to make a copy of it and set to work at once. He enjoyed a great reputation as a scholar, and as such he was greatly respected by all the other great-lamas; for the same reason he always retained about him lamas from distant countries. The fact that the missionaries met him in tents here among the mountains was explained by the fact that people used to invite him to visit their districts, on which occasion he received great gifts of horses, cattle, rice, clothes and other articles, which formed his chief source of income. He lived with his lamas in these parts, where he was within easy reach of the others. For two months the missionaries followed the king in his progress from place to place among the mountains, after which they lived in his own house, which stood on th~ same mountain as his hermitage. The rocky soil really rendered the place unfit for habitation, but it had been chosen by the king with a view to protecting himself against another prince, the greatest of Potente, who lived at eight days' distance and with whom he had been at war for some years. His name was Demba Cemba. The cause of their quarrel was that the Droma Rajah had refused to give him a bone of the body of his dead father, for which he had been urgently prayed. On account of this same war the Droma Rajah did not reside in his town of Ralum, which was only at five days' distance 1). On wishing to test and confirm Cacella's statements about this Droma Rajah by the data furnished by Bhutanesehistorywemeet with the difficulty that so very few reliable fayts of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries have come down to us. Moreover, what was still preserved in the ancient native chronicles, was, White informs us, in great part destroyed byfireandearth-quake 1) Appentli;e II, fol. 8-9."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"140 STEPHEN CACELLA AND JOHN CABRAL during the last years of the preceding century1). For what little there is we have to turn to Kishen Kant Bose, Waddell and White. Down to the present day the Dharma Rajah (Cacella's Droma Rajah) or Lama Rinpotche has been thespiritualheadofBhutan, but there was a time when the dignity did not exist. Buddhism was introduced as early as the middle qf the eighth century, and as more Bhuddist sects gained a firm footing in the country many quar-rels arose dividing the people into different parties. The man who put an end to this was, so White tells us, Dugom-Dorji, better known as Shabdung Nga-wang Namgyal. The date of his birth is supposed to be 1534. He first lived at the Dukpa monastery at Ralung, but left it and moved to Bhutan in 1557. There he soon rose to great influence, and till his death in 1592 he used all his endeavours to consolidate his temporal as well as his spiritual power. His task was an arduous one, for not only had he to conquer and keep in hand the internal situation, but also to hold his own against the Tibetans, who tried five or six times to subject Bhutan to their rule. He was the first Dharma Rajah. BeingoftheDukpa monastery he naturally made the Red-hats supreme over aG.; his fame soon spread to India and even to Ladakh. That he might wholly devote himself to the interests of religion he appointed a regent for temporal affairs, called DebRa j ah. After his death three incarnations appeared: that of his body became the Dharma Rajah, that of his voice the Chole Tulku and that of his mind the Thi Rinpoche 2). Waddell does not take quite the same view. With Kant Bose he takes it that the class ruling in Bhutan up to the middle of the six-teenth century were related to the people of Cooch Behar. Then the country was invaded by Tibeta..1 soldiers. A lama called Dup-gani Sheptun gaining great influence over them rose to be the t) White, p. 165. 1) White, p. 101 ff. According to Csoma de Koros (p. 5) Nga-wang Namgyal came to Bhutan as late as in the seventeenth century. Bonin (p. 83 ff.) gives the same version of these events. He adds that this first Dharma Rajah became so renowned that the kings of Cooch Behar, Nepal and Ladakh sought his friendship. Not only they, but even Europeans did so! For in the native chronicles it is said that envoys came from the Pardoukou (Portuguese) offering their services, which, however, were declined. White (p. 102) has a statement to the same effect, adding that those strangers carried with them \"some guns and gunpowder of a new sort and a telescope\". Are we to see in this a vague recollection of the visit of the two missionaries blurred and refashioned in process of time?

After his death his spirit became incarnate in a child at Lhasa. The child was conveyed to Bhutan, and when he was grown he placed the temporal administration in the hands of a regent or Deb Rajah. Dupgani Sheptun was a contemporary of the Great Lama Sonam Gyatsho (1543-1589); he seems to have been married, but his successors are celibate 1). If then, as the best'authorities agree in asserting, the first Dhar-ma Rajah died at the close of the sixteenth century, Cacella'shost may be taken to have been the second in the line of those dignita-ries. In his letter the Portuguese missionary repeatedly speaks of the father of theking,ofwhomthelatterhadmadeseveralimages, and whom he worshipped as a man of extraordinary holiness and almost as a god. Though it is not explicitly stated one cannot get away from the impression that by the king's father is meant the king's predecessor, which would break the continuity of the suc-cessive incarnations, of which all writers speak. A simpler solution made plausible by the unfamiliar situation of the narrator, seems to be that Cacella, unacquainted with this curious law of succession took the Dharma Rajah's wordsabouthispredecessorasnaturally referring to his father. Whether the Dharma Rajah was at the time exactly thirty-three years of age, is difficult to verify. His long beard, which Cacella says came down to his waist, might incline us to think him an older man. This beard, by the way, also played its part in the royal reception given to the travellers, for whilst it was generally worn wrapped in silk, it was now, as on all festive oc-casions, fully displayed to the eye 2). The particulars about his frugal diet find unlooked-for confirmation in an account by a ;Bhutanese of the year 1661. The man, Blochmann relates from the F athiyab i lbriyah, was taken prisoner at Kanthalbari at the foot of 1) Waddell, Buddhism, p. 242. Dupgani Sheptun's name as Dharma Rajah is given by Waddell as Nag-dhan roam rgyal bdud' jomrdorje, that of his successor as Nag-dhan 'jigmed rtags-pa, the latter being quite different from the name of White's second Dharma Rajah.

He is famous for his justice and rules over a large people\" 1). Next to the Dharma Rajah, King and Great-lama, all accounts mention the Deb Rajah or prime minister, who conducts the ad-ministration of the country. The name does not occur in Cacella's letter at all, whilst only once and as it were en passant he refers to a lama \"in whose hands rests the whole of the king's administra-tion\" 2). The town of Ralum, the residence of the king in more peaceful times, is identical with Ralung, a little over thirty miles east of Gyantse; in it is the famous Dukpa monastery, the original head-quarters of the Red-hat sect of lamas 8), which is supreme in \"Bhu-tan. The temporary residence was, as we saw, at five days' distance from Ralung, and eight from the abode of king Demba Cemba, with whom he was at war. At the end of the letter the latter king is once more referred to, when it is stated that he lived at Guiance 4). This name seems to refer to Gyantse, but if it does, the statement is corrected by Cabral in his letter of June 17, 1628, written after his visit to Utsang. He says that the residence of Demba Cemba, \"of whom we wrote in our last letter\"-Cacella's letter now under discussion - is the town of Gigaci (Shigatse) 5). The same letter of Cabral furnishes the solution of yet another difficulty raised by Cacella' s letter: the whereabouts of Cambirasi, \"thefirstof the kingdoms ofPotente in this region,\" of which the DromaRaja.h was king. The name is not known in history, nor is it found on any map, and has been a puzzle to many. Cordara refers to it as\" one of the many kingdoms which the Tartars possess between Mogor and China; on its western border lies Tibet\" 8). Barretto omits its mention altogether.

This then is Cacella's Cambirasi, which again vindicates Desideri's statement that in 1627 the two travellers were in the province of Mon 2). Csoma de K<>ros remarks on the name as follows: \"The hill people of India who dwell next to the Tibetans are called [by the latter] by the general name of Mon\" 3), to which Waddell adds that the Tibetans call the Lepchas Monbo (Mon-pa), 'inhabitants of the Mon valleys''). South of the provinces of Yarlung and Zzethang (Tsetang on the Tsangpo) Desideri places, in his descrip-tion of Tibet, the provinces of Breemegiong· (Sikkim), Pari (Phari) and Mon 6), thus attributing to this last country the north-western portion of Bhutan. Kant Bose, slightly differently, says that \"the counjry of Bhutan is bounded .... by Mem [Mon], or the Lepcha country, on the West\" 8), which raises the nicer, and perhaps un,.. answerable, question whether or how far the boundary-line, as drawn on our present-day maps, differs from that of the seven-teenth century 7). The reader, however, will excuse us from entering upon this point, and permit us roughly to identify Cacella's Cambirasi and Cabral's Mon with the north-western territory of Bhutan in the direction of Phari Dzong, which Kant Bose men-tions as in his time still belonging to Bhutan 8). But what about the name Cambirasi, and how did Cacella come to use it?

The younger ones, to the number of about one hundred, who belonged to the king's retinue, formed a kind of monastic school, whose chief occupation was to learn the rites and ceremonies of their religion. \"They are called Guelois,\" says Cacella, \"and are the most important among the lamas, because they do not marry, and take only one meal a day, before midday; after that they are not permitted to take any rice, flesh or fish. Moreover, they never drink wine, and through all these things they are distinguished from the other lamas, who are of less strict observance .. Twice a day, in the morning and in the after-noon they go out in a body. A great part of the day is spent in prayer, and even during the night they rise at a given signal to pray for half an hour, which they also do in the morning, chanting after the manner of clerics in the choir\" 1). In 1783 Turner saw almost the same sort of life in the monas-teries. \"The Gylongs [lamas] assemble in their chapels three times a day for the performance of religious service, in the morning, at noon and at night.

All the lamas, however, and nearly all the people understand the language of the other parts, so that the language we knew fitted us for all these. At the same time we endeavoured to be well up in the language of this kingdom also.\" At the time of writing they had got so far that they were able to compose the necessary pray-ers and instructions in the vernacular, which they caused to be transcribed in native characters. They were also able to read the books of the lamas though it was still a difficult business, as they were written in the best and most polished language1). Cacella's linguistic remarks coincide with those made by .Csoma de KOrOs, who noted that the peoples of Kham, U tsang and Bhutan all under-stand each other though they differ in their way of pronouncing the language, and while in Bhutan the people speak a corrupt dialect of the Tibetan language, pure Tibetan remains paramount in several religious establishments and in a large part of the litera-ture 2). According to Hermann von Schlagintweit, however, the difference between the language of Bhutan and that of Tibet at the present day is much greater 3). Cacellahas a~reat.many things to say about the religionofBhu-tan 4), but it need cause no surprise that he is not always correct when giving the results of the conversations he had on the subject with the king and the king's teacher, an old lama. Neither time nor circumstances allowed of a thorough study of the intricate Bhuddist doctrine and mythology, such a&, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, was permitted to Desideri, who knew Tibetan and was settled quietly in one of the monastic universities of Lhasa.·Cacella's mind, moreover, was strongly biased by the rumours ever afloat in India about the existence of Christian com-munities in the northern border-countries, and he had hardly learned something of their religious ceremonies when the great ques-tion was mooted whether they were Christians, which, of course, was answered in the negative.

Thus he would be led to think of one God in three Persons when the Buddhist triad Buddha, Dharma and Sangha was referred to, or of the miraculous birth of a son of God, when reference was made to the birth of A valokitesvara or Padmapani, the spiritual son of Amitabha 1). About the origin of their country the lamas told him that six hundred years ago there was no living being in Potente. All was water, but after it had dried up, the land remained with trees and two apes (bugios); from these all the people of Potent<> are sprung 2). This version agrees in the main with the Tibetan which is given by Markham from a document brought by Bogle from his expedition to Tibet. There, too, it is related that first the whole of Tibet was covered with water and subsequently became dry. Then a monkey and a Rakshasi (a female fiend) met and their issue consisted of six children. These multiplied into the people of Bhot 3). There are two more illustrations given by Cacella of the great reverence in which the Dharma Rajah, King and Great-Lama, is held. He isoffered great presents by the people that at their death he may send them to heaven. When death draws near, the king is sent for, and at the very moment of death he pulls out some of the man's hair that he may help his soul to heaven. If he should pull it out before death, great harm would ensue 4). Waddell relates a like Buddhist ceremony in Tibet, but after death. \"On the occurrence of a death the body is not disturbed in any way until the Lama has extracted the soul in the orthodox manner. For it is believed that any movement of the corpse might eject the soul, which then would wander about in an irregular manner and get seized 1) Probably this same Avalokitesvara in his monstrous eleven-headed form was meant, when Cacella was told about the legendary king with twelve heads.

On death, therefore, a white cloth is thrown over the face of the corpse, and the soul-extracting Lama ('p'o-'bo) is sent for. On his arrival all weeping relatives are excluded from the death-chamber, so as to secure solemn silence, and the door and windows closed, and the Lama sits down on a mat near the head of the corpse, and commences to chant the service which contains directions for the soul to find its way to the western paradise of the mythical Buddha-Amitabha. After advising the spirit to quit the body and its old associations and attachment to property, the Lama seizes with the f~re-finger and the thumb a few hairs of the crown of the corpse, and plucking these forcibly, he is supposed to give vent to the spirit of the deceased through the roots of these hairs; and it is generally believed that an actual but invisible minute perforation of the skull is thus made, through which the libemted spirit passes\" 1). When a man dies, our narrator goes on to say, the things found about him are distributed among the people, that the soul of the deceased may prosper in the other life, and those who were not present at the death of one of their relatives bring the bulk of the property of the deceased to the kin~ that he may pray for him. This may be refered to, when Captain Pemberton relates that on the death of any head of a family, however numerous, the whole of ,his possessions passes to the Dharma Rajah 1). Accordingto Schlag-intweit, however, this practice only obtains in the case of lamas who have in some way been connected with the court 8). As at Pando so also here the missionaries made inquiries about Cathay, but the result was equally unsatisfactory; the name had rtever been heard. But there does exist a country, the writer re-marks, very famous here, which is called Xembala and which bor-ders on another called Sopo, but about its religion the king could give no information. I think this may be Cathay, because it is very large and its border-country Sopo is a Tartar kingdom, which answers the description of Cathay given in the maps. That the name of Cathay is unknown proves nothing, for neither China, nor 1) Waddell, Buddhism, p. 488.

The little he had learned about Xembala was enough to inspire Cacella with a desire to penetrate into that distant territory. The idea of leaving had already suggested itself to his mind, for with all the outward show of kindness on the part of the king it seemed evident that mission-work-and this remained the main object which was never lost sight of -had little chance of success. In fact, he had already proposed to the· Dharma Rajah that they should leave the country and join Andrade at Tsaparang. But the king had been piqued at the suggestion, for did not all the neigh-bouring countries know that they were his guests and that he con-sidered this a great honour? Their departure would cast a slur upon him. Feeling, however, he had to do something he had given them leave to preach Christianity, promising to build them a to use and church at Paro. Cacella had acquiesced, but after some further experience he resolved to go, while Cabral was to stay if the king made good his promise; for through a house of prayer he hoped he might draw the people. \"For temples\", he says, \"are very few here. During the sixteen days of our mountain journey we noticed but one, right on the top of a mountain on a prominent rock, and the only thing we saw at Pargao was a lama's small house that served as a temple\". This, at first sight, would seem to traverse Bogle's statement tha~ \"there are numbers of temples on all the roads\" 2); but the two are reconciled by J?avis's remarks on the subject. There are he says no special buildings set .apart for reli-gious services; they are only held before altars erected in large apartments in the palaces and castles where the Gylongs are lodged, and the people are under no obligation to attend; but there are many small temples by the road-side with some representa-tion of the deity whether painted or sculptured 8). These may be supposed to have been there in Cacella's time, but religious worship not being their object he saw no reason to class them with temples. The reader may remember the missionary's remark about the king's proficiency in the art of painting and about the images he 1) Appmdix II, fol. 12.

Compo may be supposed to refer to Congbo or Congpo, a Tibetan province extending along the Tsangpo on the border of Kham.

The fact of the presence of the latter at Tsaparang is sufficiently clear from Andrade 9), though he does not mention them by name, whilst the existence of these friendly relations between the two countries is attested by an event related in Dr. Marx's History of Ladakh.

Cacella is silent about the character of the Bhutanese, but from what he experienced at the very first village and during his stay at Paro we may safely infer that his description would not have been flattering. He is more diffuse about their appearance, dress, ornaments and arms. \"Their skin is fair though they hardly look it on account of want of personal cleanliness. All wear their hair long, so that it covers the ears and part of the forehead. On the face there is no hair as a ntle, and on their breast they carry two pair of small well-made tongs, which are only used to pull out the hairs' that might appear.

According to Turner the colour of their skin is less dark than that of the Portuguese; but cleanliness is quite beyond their comprehen-sion 1) -evidently a family failing, for their Tibetan cousins are hardly better than they. But their hair is worn short, which is also remarked by Godwin Austen, who likewise notes the absence of bangles 2). With reference to the arms, finally, we may mention Turner's remark that Paro is famous for the forging of arms especially of swords and daggers and the barbs of arrows 3). That Cacella having made up his mind to depart was not a man to be deterred by difficulties will by now be evident to the reader, and as he was quite aware that the Dharma Rajah would not grant him a gracious leave, he would dispense with it altogether and take the first opportunity to escape from his forced detention. The particulars that follow are not derived from any documents Irom Cacella's 'hand, for none are known to be extant.

One day, when at length the king had gone out to survey the site destined for the erection, Cacella went to a lama who was not quite friendly to the king and who was acquainted with the king of Uc;angue (Utsang). From him he obtained the necessary equipment and escort, and in twenty days reached Gigaci (Shigatse), where the king resided. Being kindly received he sent for Cabral backed by letters from the king to the Dharma Rajah. Very unwillingly the latter allowed the departure on December 18, 1627, but owing to some delay on the road Cabral was not able to join Cacella till January 20. No route is mentioned in either case; but taking Paro as their point of departure the obvious route would be by Phari and Gyantse, the same as that followed by Younghusband's expedition on the march to Lhasa.

The construction of the fort is after the plan of those of Portugal, the only thing that is wanting is artillery. The insides of the houses are gilded and painted, and the wing containing the king's apart-ments is really worth seeing, more especially some rooms full of trinkets, which he has of every sort, for being a rich man h~ has the best of everything from everywhere. Hangings are much used in all his rooms, the plainer ones being of Chinese damask, but the others are equal to the very best in Portugal. The king's retainers dress very neatly, but the common people differ very little in this respect from those of the other kingdom of which we wrote to you before, and of which we now know that it is called Mon 2). The kingdom of U<;angue is very large, and, from whichever side it is entered, the passage, it is said, always takes a month and a half. It is moreover so densely populated that during the twenty days of my journey from there to the kingdom of Nepal my route always lay by and through villages. The climate is cold. In January and February I have crossed several frozen streams on horse-back, but the snowfall is insignificant. There are large com-fields, ') Cabral gives no name, but at the beginning of his letter he speaks of their depar-ture from the Dharma Rajah \"to the kingdom (o reino) of U~angue, called Deba Cam· ba, mentioned in our last letter.\" As, however, Demba Cemba, mentioned in Cacella's letter, is not a kingdom but a king, Cabral evidently meant to write \"to the king (o Rei) of U~angue, called Deba Camba.\" •) It is unnecessary for us to dwell at any length on Shigatse. The town is well-known through later writers such as Chandra Das, Rawling, Sven Hedin and others. There is a plan of the town in Das, p. 58, and a picture of the castle in Hedin, Trans-himalaia, I, 201, n. 105."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"STEPHEN CACELLA AND JOHN CABRAL 155 and I have seen no country more like Alemtejo in Portugal than this. To the northward it is bounded by the territory of the Tar-tars, with whom the king is sometimes at variance; the religion of the two countries, many say, is the same. Towards theeastisCo-chinchina, from where much merchandise arrives as well as from China, which is to the north-east. The two latter countries border on Cam (Kham), from where the musk comes. Xembala is in my opinion not Catayo but what in our maps is called Great Tartarea; Catayo lies more to the north 1). In this kingdom of U <;angue reside the chiefs of all the sects of lamas, hence they call it the school of theirreligion. Theirmonas-teries, which they call Compas (Gompas), are not like ours but each Great-Lama has his own town, where he lives only with his own lamas. The Compa of the lamas of Chaparangue is situated near the fort here, at two cannon-shots' distance, and on account of this we get tidings about our Fathers every day, though they are at a month's distance away from us. These lamas are not very favourably regarded by the king, because he says they are a bad sort. The Great-Lamas live in royal splendour, and among them the Lama Rupa (the Dharma Rajah), about whom so much has been written, ranks in the fifth place, from which you may conclude what the others will be like. Fortunately none of them as a rule are in attendance on the king 2). Though Cabral does not mention the name of the \"Compa of the lamas of Chaparangue\", he cannot mean anything else than the famous monastery of Tashi Lhumpo, which ·at the present time is the residence oftheTashi Lama or the Pantchen Rinpotche. The castle of Shigatse according to Turner stood \"upon a pro-minent ridge of the same rock on which the monastery is built\" 3). Its situation is estimated by Rawling at \"half a mile to the east of the town on the left bank of the river'' 4). The stay of the two Portuguese at Utsangnearlycoincides with the turning-point in Tibetan history. At the time a king still resided in the castle, and the temporal and the spiritual powers were still severed, but only a few years later the ambitious Ngavang Lobsang would be at the head of Tashi Lhumpo and revolutionize 1) Compare Cacella's ideas of Xembala on p. 147. •) Appendix III, fol. 2. 3) Turn!'r,-p. 295. •) Rawling, p. 178."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"156 STEPHEN CACELLA AND JOHN CABRAL the whole system of government. For very soon, so we learn from Tibetan records, he came into conflict with a king of Tibet or of Eastern Tibet 1) and defeated him with the aid of tribes from the Koko-nor territory. In 1642 he began the building of the Potala at Lhasa, visited Pekin and managed so well that the emperor invested him with the temporal and spiritual authority over the whole of Tibet. He was the first Dalai Lama, the Gyalba Rinpotche or 'Gem of Majesty', and created for the head of Tashi Lhumpo the dignity of Tashi Lama, second only to his. By establishing the successions of the Dalai Lamas and Tashi Lamas as they now exist, he made the turbulent Yellow-caps, the Gelugpa sect, paramount in Tibet. At the time of Grueber and d'Orville's stay at Lhasa in 1661 Ngavang Lobsang was at the zenith of his power. That Tashi Lhumpo, like Bhutan, had relations with Tsaparang need not surprise us, for we know from Andrade's letters that besides Red-caps there were also Yellow-caps in the place of his residence 2). The head of Tashi Lhumpo even went to visit the country of Guge in 1610 at the invitation of its rajah 3). Whereas Cacella when in Bhutan could not bring himself to see that those people with their curious religious ceremonies were pagans, Cabral now admits it. \"I begin to believe that these coun-tries are pagan, both because they say they are, and because I have found that they have the same pagodas as the kingdom of Nepal and some kingdoms of Bengal. They only differ from the latter in not having their superstitions of caste and food.\" Though he has already touched on Cathay, at the end of his letter here-turns once more to this land of fable - how little has hitherto bee-n the fruit borne by Goes' journey and Ricci's letters! ''As regards Catayo the more we learn of that country the less we know of it. One of the king's lamas told me that there was a country called Cata, whose religion he did not know for certain, but of which he had been told that it was very old and that it differed from that of these countries. The road to it he said is by Coscar [Kashgar], a well-known town, which accords with the report of Father Jerome Xavier, in which the same town is spoken of'). 1) On this point the records are not decisive, and, for all we know, the adversary may have been the king of Shigatse himself, who, as Cabral informed us, was no friend of Tashi Lhumpo and did not sympathize with its lamas. 1) Andrade, LeUet' of Aug. r6, r6:16.

The object of this journey together with its general outline are given in the same letter. \"It [the object] was, in the first place, to discover this new route through the kingdom of Nepal, in order that the mission might be continued through it, as the road through Cocho is so dangerous and uncertain. I have also come [to Hugli] to settle some affairs in connection with this mission, which I think may become one of the most glorious of the Society of Jesus; it is the gate to the whole of Tartary, China and many other pagan countries.\" Returning to the subject at the close of his letter he says: \"The road to those countries is not through Cocho but through Nepal, which borders on Mogor. In Patana [Patna] and Rajamol [Raimahal] the road is perfectly safe and is used by many traders. The king gave me a captain to conduct me to Nepal. The latter carried letters and presents for the king of Nepal requesting him to help me in whatever I might need, as he esteem~d me highly. This was done by the king of Nepal and very kindly he directed me to Patana, where I fell in with some Portu-guese, with whom I have come to Gulim [Hugli], from where I write this letter. About the kingdom of Nepal I shall Wtite to you at greater length later on, as I hope to get news there from Father Cacella and about the events that have taken place.\" With the absence of all detail about this winter journey the reader is left to imagine those paths and passes buried under deep snow at an altitude of many thousand feet, and in the midst of these the lonely traveller with his one or two guides, whose lan-guage he hardly understands, and thence to form his judgment of the grit and intrepidity required to undertake it and carry it through. As they were the bearers of letters for the king of Nepal, their road no doubt went by Katmandu, whither thirty years later the Fathers Grueber and d'Orville were to direct their steps on quitting Lhasa. Here we should have to break off the discussion of this remark-able mission-journey and leave the reader in uncertainty about the further adventures of the two men, whom he has followed for a while on their wanderings through Bhutan and Tibet, but for another letter of Cabral's written from Utsang to the missionaries"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"158 STEPHEN CACELLA AND JOHN CABRAL at Tsaparang, the contents of which have been preserved by Aze-vedo in the account of his own expedition 1). Azevedo does not say when and where it was written, but since the contents show that it was written from Shigatse, as will I think clearly appear in the sequel, and since it was received at Tsaparang some days after August 26, 1631, it must have been despatched about the end of July 1631, for the two towns of Tsaparang and Shigatse are by Cabral's own statement at one month's journey distant from each other 2). Three years therefore lie between this letter and the one discussed above. Azevedo summarizes Cabral's letter as follows: \"Father Stephen Cacella and myself went to this mission from Bengal. The Rajah Mana Rupa retained us for seven months on the way, after which F. Cacella set out for Uzangue and despatched me to Bengal to fetch some things that were needed. I tried tc find a road 3) and reached Oguly [Hugli] just when the Indian fleet arrived [June 1628] and with it Father Manuel Diaz with orders from Father Alberto 4) to go to the mission if Father Cacella should send for some Fathers. As the latter had not invited any one, I objected to the departure of F. n;az, who had been sent by the Father Rector of Bengal with unconditional orders. These difficulties protracted my stay at Oguly so long th;:~.t I missed the favourable season [moussam] to return to Nepal. So I went to Cocho, from where I sent word to Father Cacella requesting him to send me a royal escort that I might pass on; for as the country of Cumba [Chumbi between Bhutan and Sikhim] bordering on that of Cocho had no king, it could :qot be traversed without the protection of an escort. My letter arrived so late that Father Ca-cella had already left for Bengal, because he could not, on account of the snow, get through to Chaparangue, for which place he had first set out. Finding, when in Bengal, that I was in Cocho with Father Diaz, he came to fetch us at once, although he was so ill that he could hardly stand, and in September 1629 he set out with Father Diaz, leaving me in Cocho With some luggage and intend-ing to send for me in January. The difficulties they had to con-tend with on their way were such that in consequence of them 1) Appendix I, fol. 33. 1) Appendix III, fol. 2. 0) \"Fuy para via de palpo\", or in modern Portuguese \"fui ~ apalpadellas.\" ') Father Albert Laertius, Provincial of the Province of Malabar."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"STEPHEN CACELLA AND JOHN CABRAL 159 Father Manuel Diaz died on November 3 in the kingdom of Mo-rongo [Morang] 1). \"Father Cacella reached Uzangue in such a state of health that only seven days after his arrival, even before he had seen the king, God took him on March 6, 1630 2). \"The king was deeply impressed by his death and at once sent for me to Cocho, but as it was winter the summons could have no effect. This year, 1631, he repeated his request by sending an escort, upon which I resolved to go in ordernottooffendhiman.d not to leave the goods of the church in his hands. For a month and a half I have been here and have met with a very kind reception on the part of the king. Father Provincial Gaspar Frz [Fernandez] does not show himself anxious to continue the mission, and he will relinquish it on hearing of the death of the two Fathers. I have aske<l him to place me under your authority ... It will be for you to decide whether it is desirable to establish a permanent station here, to which the king will not object\" 8). This last suggestion commended itself to Azevedo especially because it was in Utsang that the great schools of the lamas were found, and before setting out for Leh ib.e may have instructed the missionaries of Tsaparang to communicate with Shigatse. Though we cannot attain to certainty on this point, we may quote here from a letter of F. de Castro written from Mogol on Aug. 8, 1632, in which with reference to the mission of Tsaparang he says: \"According to letters received here the Superior has gone to an-other mission-station established by the Fathers of the Cochin 'l Manuel Diaz was bom ln 1592 at Alpalhio or Aspalham in the diocese of Porta-legre, became a Jesuit in 1608 and left for India in 1614. lie worked first in Cochin, then for one year he was Rector of the college of St. Thomas (1627-1.628), after which he received orders for Cacella's mission. Cf. Besse, p. 22, note 1 ;Sommervogel, III, 44, and IX, 212, 1763. The year 1630, generally given as the year of Dfaz's death, is here shown to be incorrect. According to A. Franco (lmagem de Virlfllle em o Noviciado de Evora, (Lisboa 1714), p. 495) his death occurred at a village called Oacho. 1) Cacella had only reached the age of forty-five. The remark that he had arrived in Utsang but had not seen the king allows room for Desideri's statement (Difesa, p. 3) that he died and was buried at Shigatse. He certainly did not die in Guge, Western Tibet (Besse p. 20, note 4), nor at Tsaparang (De Queyros, Hisloria d4 Vsda do v-a-llel Irmdo Pedro tle Basto, (Lisboa 1689) p. 222). The Littera anntUJ annh63odoesnot record the death of the two missionaries. All it has to say about Tibet is: \"There are three Fathers in the Cathay mission\".

Thus the Superior hopes to help his own mission, because all the kings of Tibet obey the great king of Uc;angue\". Beyond these few lines there is nothing in any letters private or official referring in any way to this new enterprise; hence it may safely be assumed either not to have been started at all or to have had no appreciable result. If we are to believe Cordara, Cabral's apprehensions that the Provincial might be unwilling to continue the undertaking were well founded, and he was recalled to Malabar1). But whether re-called or not, he was certainly back at Hugli in 1632, where he was an eye-witness and nearly a victim of the siege and sack of this settlement by Shah Jehan's army, as he himself informed his Pro-vincial in a long letter written from Ceylon, November 12, 16332). There is one more mention of Utsang, in the report, already known tg the reader, which was drawn up at Tsaparang on the state and prospects of that mission by Father Coresma on August 30, 1635 3). From like premisses he arrives at a like conclusion; as in the case of the mission of Tsaparang, so also in that begun by Cacella and Cabral his. verdict is: the risks are too great, the promise of success also is too uncertain, the king's only object is to obtain presents from the missionaries .... therefore let the mission be relinquished. This settled the matter. There was only one who stood up for the continuance of the mission. In the annual report for 1643 Father Simon de Figueiredo, the same who in 1626 accompanied Cacella 1) Conlara, II, 132. Cordara's notes are incomplete and unreliable. After stating that the efforts of the missionaries in Cambh·asi came to nothing, he continues: \"Then they went to the neighbouring country of Urang with similar result. On hearing this in C'ochin Father Laertius called them back to the Malabar province.\" Not a word is said about the death of Diaz or Cacella, whilst the mention of Laertius as Provincial is incorrect, as in 1631 that post was held by Fernandez as appears from Cabral's letter. I have made no reference to Barretto's account (p. 115-118) as his information is of no special value for the right understanding and appreciation of the expedition. He is more detailed than Cordara and refers to Cabral's departure from Utsang, or Catai as he calls it, and to Cacella's death in the same country. On Diaz he is altogether silent. 1) Cabral's short visit to Tibet is only an episode in the. long tale of his travels. For years after he was engaged in mission work not in one place but in Cochin, in Japan, in Tonkin, then at Malacca and at Macao, and lastly as Provincial once more in Japan from 1650 to 1654. On his return he remained in the province of Goa, and among bthers was stationed for four years at Salsette. He died at Goa on July 4, 1669. Cf. Sommervogel. II, 494, and VIII, 1956. •) Cf.

Yet this was done by two missionaries, and what Ritter wrote in 1833 still remains true that, as Grueber and d'Orville certainly were the first, so perhaps they still are the only Europeans of modern times who have traversed this route 1). Consequently their names do, indeed, find a place in every work of importance on Tibet 2), but the remark made in the preceding chapters again applies here, that the details of their journey as given in those works are either exceedingly scanty or on several points incorrect. It was this neglect that led Richard Tronnier to publish an excel-lent article intended to set the two travellers in their rightful place and to draw attention to the scientific value of their expedition 3). But however grateful one must be for the results obtained, more and in part unpublished documents enable us to give a still fuller and truer picture both of the men and of their work. How little they are known outside the small circle of specialists is sufficiently borne out by the fact that Grueber's name will be looked for in vain in theAllgemeineDeutscheBiographie and that his companion d'Orville has not been able to secure a place in the Biographie N ationale de Belgique. 1) Ritter, -II, 453. 1) Cf.

The record must be pieced together from data drawn from ·different sources of unequal value,-a pro-cess which necessitates a somewhat lengthy critical disquisition. Four principal sources are to be distinguished: i) a number of letters from Grueber's hand-ii) a short account by Kircher in his China Illustrata -iii) an Italian notice embodied by Thevenot in his Relations de divers Voyages Curieux-iv) ten answers given by Grueber to as many questions proposed to him by the Archduke of Tuscany. About each of these a few words must be said. 1. Grueber's earliest letter was sent from Surat in India on March 7, 1658, to Father JohnHaffenecker, S. J.,rectorofthecol-lege and of the university of Gratz in Styria. A copy of the origi-nal Latin is in the state-archives of Brussels and was first published by lL Bosmans, S. J., in his Documents sur Albert DorviUe de Bruxelles 1). A free German translation had been given to the public by J. Stocklein, S. J ., in his collection of letters Der Neue Welt-Bott 2). The second letter; bearing no date and addressed to Father John Gamans at Aschaffenburg, was written after Grueber's return from China, most probably in the beginning of 1664, in any case before his second journey eastward, since the closing words are: \"This as regards China, to which with God's help I shall re-turn shortly\" 3). For our present purpose this letter is the most important. It is to be found in Thevenot's book after the Ital-ian notice, which. will be discussed presently. The third letter, addressed to Kircher from Venice on May 10, 1664, at the beginning of the attempted second journey to China, maybefoundinChina Illustrata 4).

They are given by Thevenot after the second letter. While looking for fresh evidence I was fortunate enough to ob-tain copies of nine other unpublished letters of Grueber to Kir-cher. They were written between 1664 and 1671, and though they are not of very great direct value for the purpose of a reconstruc-tion of the journey, yet there are many small details contained in them which may serve to throw light on several obscure points. For a fuller account of these letters the reader is referred to the List ofMSS. Finally we must note two Latin documents from Grueber's hand. One is a eulogy on d'Orville, who after being his companion as far 'as Agra, had died at this town shortly after their arrival; !t was written at Rome on March 29, 1664, and is given in full by Bosmans 1). The other, likewise an obituary notice written in mem-ory of Father Henry Roth, who accompanied Grueber from Agra to Rome, was composed on January 30, 1670, at Tyrnau in Hun-gary. It is among the state archives at Munich 2). 2. Of far greater importance naturally is Kircher's account 8) written as it was under instructions from Gruel:er and Roth, as is clearly stated in the introduction. ') Grueber himself touches on this point in his Danzig letter : \"As regards the geography, although I have made a good many notes I cannot tell you anything at present having left everything with Father Kircher at Rome, who is engaged in publishing it .... All will be printed at Vienna by order of his Imperial Majesty and will soon see the light 6). 1) Bosmans, p. 82-85. 1) ]esuitica in genere, Fasc. 13, n. 215. 1) Kircher, China Illustrata, p. 64-78.

In this he probably follows Markham, who on p. !vii of his Introduction asserts that the original account of the journey has been preserved in a small booklet by Carlieri; of this an extract is supposed to have been furnished to Kircher, whilst both the booklet and the extract were printed by Th6venot.

In Grueber's opinion, then, Kircher was his official editor, and bearing this in mind one can hardly understand why this learned writer should have left his work in so many points incomplete and incorrect, especially as he had Grueber so near him. Was it that he did not grasp the signifi-cance of the journey so that many topographical observations, and those of first rate importance, are entirely wanting in his account? .... Or may perhaps Grueber have to be made answerable for the shortcomings of Kircher's book, because he did not furnish full information to the writer? Did the preparations for the return-journey and other engagements absorb most of his time during his two and a half months' stay at Rome, so that his editor had to be satisfied with a rough and ready account o~ the expedition and a promise of further details at some later date? It would seem to be so. For in his letter from Gorz February 26, 1666, Grueber informs Kir~her, that he will shortly comply with his request and send the whole journal, together with the complete history of the kingdom of Barantola (Lhasa), which he will be free to dispose of at. will. He will also try to add drawings of some remarkable things he has seen on his journey 1). Evidently therefore Kircher had applied for more details than he had at his disposal, that he might use them in the composition of his book. When the long-eY.:pected journal did not arrive and he was forced to go to press without it, he still hoped one day to have it for a possible second edition, for he goes on insisting on its being sent him, as is clear from all those of Grueber's later letters of which I possess a copy. Grueber himself greatly regretted the deficienCies of Kircher's account. Thus on September 20, 1669, he writes from Tyrnau, that he has arrived at that town after an absence of two years as an army-chaplain in Transsylvania. On a trip toLeopoldstadt, situated in the neighbourhood, he had first come across the China IUus-trata. Grateful for the honourable mention of his expedition he adds: \"I wish you had at least sent me the headings of the chap-1) Grueber, Letter from Goritia, February z6, z666: \"Proxime mittam Vestrae Reve-rentiae totum petitum itinerarium meum cum tota historia regni Barantolae; utatur his prout iudicaverit in Dflo; conabor etiam delineationes aliquas addere aliquaram rerum curiosarum quas in itinere conspexi.\""},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"168 JOHN GRUEBER AND ALBERT D'ORVILLE ters before going to press; I should certainly have supplied you with several data of no small importance.

There are cer-tainly points in China Illustrata that need correction, especially the drawings, but it is better to leave things as they are, though I shall send you the emendations for insertion in case the work should be reprinted\" 1). Shortly after on October 7 writing from Tyrnau he tells Kircher that he has ordered a copy of China Illustrata from Vienna at his correspondent's charge, and invites him to remit the price of it at once, if he wishes to continue in the writer's favour and to ob-tain possession of the· marvellous things which he is engaged in writing, and of the important drawings and the corrections of mis-takes already made 2). To this Kircher must have 'replied at once for on December 13, 1669, Grueber informs him, that as he has again asked for the journal at the request of the Duke of Etrnria, he sends him the first chapter; the second is to follow after a week. Want of time has prevented him from making the drawings, which he will send in sets. In a postscript he insists on' Kircher letting him have his opinion on the plan of the journal, whether he is to continue on the same lines or not 3). A month later another letter goes from Tyrnau to Rome, but the tone is less friendly. He has received no reply to his last letter, so he will not send any more, before he has been satisfied that his letters and the first instalment of the journal have been duly re-ceived.

On march 17, 1670, there is a third letter from the same place: Kircher's reply has meanwhile reached Grueber, but it does not contain a word about the first chapter. Kircher would also seem to have applied for a contribution towards the expenses of the publication, for Grueber refers him to the Em-peror, 'Yho has promised ample pecuniary support. Finally he gives his correspondent to understand that the portrait of the Emperor of China carrying a stick and accompanied by a dog, as given in China Illustrata, will be taken as an insult in that country. The Emperor should be represented standing or sitting at a table covered with books and mathematical instruments; so he requests Kircher to have this changed accordingly in the Italian edition 2). He himself will protest against this representation in the journal he is going to publish. Kircher may have taken offence at these remarks, for in a letter of December 23 from Jaurin (Raab) Grue-ber reverts to the subject saying that the print will not do and that .i.t shall be differently printed in his own account, which he hopes will be given to the public in the course of the following year 8). These remarks would seem to point to Grueber's intention of keeping the publication in his own hand. Be this as it may, his hopes were not realised, for he writes from Trencsin, May 2, 1671: \"Being engaged in laborious and incessant work among the sol-diers I have, as yet, been unable to finish the work I have begun; but now that I have more leisure I hope with God's help to have the whole completed before the end of autumn\"'). Did this expec-tation come true, or was this \"itinerarium\" ever finished at all? And if so, where did it get to? What has become of the first chap-ter, which Kircher must have received?

As to the Italian notice, it is the outcome of a Jong conversa-tion which Grueber had on January 30, 1666, at Florence with two Italians, only one of whom, Carlo Dati, is known by name 1). This interview was put down in writing afterwards. From the ac-count itself it is clear that it was not so much the journey as the manners and customs of the Chinese that the inquirers wished to be informed about; for the few things said of the expedition itself would hardly cover two of the seventeen and a half folio pages, which the account occupies in Thevenot. But who drew up this report? Thevenot, the first to print it in 1672 under the title of Viaggio del P. Giovanni Grueber tomando per terra da China in Europa, mentions no name, but ~t the end of his French transla-tion, subjoined to the original Italian, he says: \"J e croirais faire tort au public, si je ne luy avais donne la relation du P. Grueber dans la langue mesme dans laquelle elle a estee ecrite; car 1' on entend assez ici cette langue pour y reconnaistre un style noble, propre et juste, et un charactere d'esprit, quiferadevineraisement le nom de son autheur\" 2). The riddle, however, seems to have been somewhat hard to read, for no record of the author's name has come down to us. In his N otizie varie dell' Imperio della China 3) J acopo Carlieri only informs us that the account which he prints, and which in a few unimportant particulars deviates from Theve-not's Viaggio, had been written a few years before by a member of the University of Florence 4).

This fact is difficult to reconcile with the statements of Sommervogel1) and Puini 2) who take it to be a composition of Magalotti'-s. What then, for our present purpose, is the value to be attached to the Italian document in question? The fact of its being anonymous, of its being perhaps third hand evidence, of its being put together after the interview with the aid, may-be, of a few short notes must needs call for caution; to which should be added the remarkable fact that there are particulars given here, and very important ones too, which are not touched upon either in Grueber's letters or in Kircher's account. Inaccuracies and mistakes, on the other hand, are of fairly frequent occurrence, though a misunderstanding of Grueber' s replies, or incorrect jottings during the. interview may account for some of them. But the particulars regarding the journey itself, at any rate, cannot have been invented, fitting in as they do admir-ably with the whole of the journey, and .... confirmed as they are by Grueber himself in his answers to the Archduke of Tuscany. Thus, though the Italian notice cannot supply us with any fresh and reliable material, it serves to confirm such data as have come to us from elsewhere. 4. To come to our last source.

He accepted and together they set out for Rome 1). In the course of the same year 1656 they started for China. Before leaving Grueber was urgently pressed by Kircher to report to him every-thing worthy of note which he might come across on his long journey 2). This request was only natural as Grueber was to strike out a new route and not to make the voyage Lisbon-Goa as had been done by all his predecessors. What precisely was the object to be achieved in thus leaving the traditional ocean-route cannot now be ascertained the written instructions of his superiors having been lost. Was it the hope of discovering a safer route than the long journey by the Cape, which what with storms, freebooters, sickness and starvation had proved fatal to so many; or a desire to get rid of the oppressive protection of the Portuguese Government who had prescribed this route for all missionaries of whatever nationality travelling to their colonies or the countries within their sphere of influence? Only in Portuguese ships the passage was to be made, and how strictly this regulation was pressed appears among other things from a letter of King Alfonso VI. of Portug:U to Father Goswin Nickel, General of the Society of Jesus, written July 17, 1664, in which the former seriously remonstrates on the subject of its non-observance 3). However this may be, in 1656 Grueber und Diestel sailed from Venice to Smyrna, and travelling through Asia Minor and Armenia reached Bender Abbas on the south coast of Persia, whence they crossed into the island of Ormuz. Though such an overland journey in the second part of the seventeenth century is a sufficiently remarkable performance, we do not intend to dwell on it, as it is known from several other books of travel4). At Ormuz they took ship for Surat on the Gulf of Cambay, north of Bombay, where they were detained for ten months as Grueber informs Father Haffenecker in a letter written 1) These details are taken from the eulogy on Grueber.

He calculated the longitude at the time of a lunar eclipse in December 1657, but the letter containing his results never reached its destination 2). An English vessel took them directly to Macao, where they landed safely towards the end of July of the same year, 1658. This date must be maintained against any other, affirmed as it is by d'Orville, Grueber's future travel-ling-companion. In a letter from Macao, dated October 30, 1658 8) he writes that a few days after his own arrival (July 17, 1658), there had arrived at Macao Father Grueber and his travelling-companion, Father Bernard Diestel, likewise a German'). Grueber's stay at Macao must have been very short, for in the same letter d'Orville expects him to be sent to Pekin to assist Father Adam Schall at the imperial observatory. To what degree mathematical and astronomical studies had fitted Grueber, when still in Europe, for this important work, we are unable to say, but that he must have been thoroughly grounded in these depart-ments of science his subsequent labours leave no room to doubt. His regular work at Pekin, however, was not long to continue uninterrupted. Of late there had arisen various doubts and diffi-culties calling for an early solution; letters on the other hand were so inadequate to the dear statement of a case and their arrival so uncertain, so dependent on the countless dangers from the ele-ments and from men; that we are not surprised to find that the Superior of the mission thought of despatching one of his men, nor that he fixed his eye on the intrepid German, whom his long jour-ney had made an experienced traveller: so he made up his mind to send Grueber to Rome as his agent 6).

Macao was still, indeed, a Portu-guese stronghold, but their power in the east was rapidly crum-bling away under the blows of the Dutch. It was especially Bort and Speelman, the enterprising lieutenants of Jan Maetsuiker, the governor-general of Batavia at the time, who harassed them incessantly. TheyblockadedeveryChinese port and held up every vessel sailing from Macao, in the first place, of course, those of the Portuguese. Such being the situation the idea of travelling by land suggested itself. Would it be possible to reach India, and yet avoid the perils of the sea? The memory of Goes' journey was no doubt still sufficiently alive at Pekin, but his route must have been dis-carded as too long and impracticable. Another route through South-China, Tonkin, Siam and Pegu came up for discussion, but it was set aside on account of the great variety of peoples, languages and customs of the countries that would have to be traversed 1). As the question of a Siberian route had never yet been mooted 2), there remained only the border-country, Tibet, the goal of many cara-vans every yeru:, which therefore might be worth trying. Gn..eber's mission to and from China is viewed in quite a dif-ferent light by Bosmans. Discarding the traditional interpretation he asserts that the definite object of Grueber's mission to the East was, first to go to China following an overland route as far as possible, and then, after a,few months' rest, to return from China to India by land 3). In support of his opinion he adduces a letter of F. Fr. de Rougemont, dated July 27, 1661, which says: \"F. J oh. Bapt. Grueber sent to China by our Very Rever~nd writes from Rome: \"Nunc R. V. significo me ex voluntate Superiorum e Sinis hue mis-sum ob aliqua negotia.\" 1) This is stated by Grueber himself. Cf. Appendix IV, where his letter of January 13, 1670 is printed in full. \"l The first to look in this direction was Father Verbiest, the director of the Pekin observatory. For him, too, the chief motives were the countless perils of the sea-voyage round by the Cape, and the menace from the Dutch, who made the journey in Portuguese ships practically impossible. When in 1676 Nicholas Spathar Milescu came to Pekin at the head of an embassy, Verbiest took the opportunity to write to the Tsar to secure his sanction of the project.

As against this we can only reaffirm that the land-route was tried because it was the only one that was open, thus taking our stand on Grueber's explicit state-ment to Gamans, that \"as the sea-route was closed by the Dutch blockading the Portuguese ports I have, with the exception of a few days, made the whole of this journey by land\" 2). Thus it was only when the ocean-route proved impossible that the idea of a overland journey suggested itself. The same letter, moreover, states that he is sent by the Superiors of the Chinese mission, which would be meaningless if he had been sent to China by the General with the avowed purpose of returning almost immediately; for there could then be . no question of either sending or not sending him on the part of the local Superiors. Lastly it is well-nigh impossible to suppose that,having been charged with a task of such unusual magnitude, neither Grueber himself in his letters nor Kircherinhisaccountshouldhavehad a word to say on the subject. The quotation from Rougemont's letter given above is of value in so far as it shows Grueber's anxiety to have a companion in his travels, a desire which was natural enough in one who could not be ignorant of the lonely death of Bento de Goes on the Chinese frontier. But who was this companion? Thanks to the strenuous researches of Father Bosmans we are at present sufficiently ac-quainted with the particulars of Father d'Orville's life. Albert Le Comte was the third son of Louis Le Comte, seigneur of Orville, and of Anna Hellincx, and was born at Brussels August 12 or 20, 1621 8). There are different ways of writing the name.

Having first studied for three years at Ingolstadt he was from 1651-1654 a theological student at Louvain. Here it was that in 1654 he saw Father Martin Martini 1). Leaving China in 1651 to report on the mission at Rome Martini was long detained at Batavia, but at length reached Amsterdam. At Louvain his lec-tures on China made a great stir, and among the first to volunteer was d'Orville. Setting out almost immediately he was already on his way to Vienna and thence to Rome, when a letter from the General, Goswin Nickel, arrived at Louvain disapproving of and annulling his nomination to the mission. Meanwhile he arrived at Rome, where he finished his studies, and at last obtained the desired permission setting out with Martini in 16562). We may note in passing that Father Ferdinand Verbiest, who was to become so famous later on, was also one of the little band. They followed the usual route by way of Lisbon and the Cape. That the misery to be sustained through those dreary months was very great, and the conditions of life on board unpardonably wretched was a common experience of outgoing missionaries in those times, and may in the present case appear from the fact that, on landing at Goa probably at the beginning of 1657, of the eighteen com-panions of Martini's who sailed from Lisbon two had died, one had gone mad, another was totally paralyzed and near his death, whilst all of them were in a very weak state of health.

D'Orville's arrival at Macao was shortly afterwards followed by Grueber's, as we saw above.

This description compels us to face the fact that at present no Great Wallis to be seen near Hsi-ning. Von Richthofen and Mark-ham simply pass over the statement as a mistake of Grueber's, and Tronnier takes no notice of it 2). Yet it invites discussion; when a man like Grueber stays a fortnight in the town and describes its situation so fully one can hardly think of a mistake or a slip. It is well-known that it is precisely the valley of the Hsi-ning-ho, situated at ~high level. but enclosed on the north and south by massive mountain ranges, which has suffered terribly through the repeated rebellions of the Dzungarians againts their Chinese mas-ters, and the traces of their devastations are still visible 3). That on account of these inroads an existing defensive wall must have suffered and in some places may have gone to ruin is likely enough, the more so as it must be conceived as a broad, earthen embank-ment rather than as a defence in brick and stone. Father Gerbillon, who visited the Chinese wall over 9-early the whole of its length, writes of it as follows: \"Having traversed nearly the whole of it and having passed through nearly all its most famous gates I may speak of it as one who knows .... The first part, from the eastern sea to the beginning of the province of Chan-si, is entirely con-structed in stone and brick. . . . From the beginning of the pro-vince of Chan-si to the other extremity in the west it is but a mud wall, or rather it is a terrace in many places gone to ruin, which I have crossed and recrossed many times on horseback. It is true that at certain intervals towers are found which here and there ~re of stone or brick, but most of them are of mud. To make up for this there are forts along the whole length of the wall, on the in-side and four leagues apart, which at the time of the Tai-ming dynasty held strong garrisons .... At present these garrisons are mostly small and consist of Chinese soldiers only; it is but at some points of importance such as Fouen-fou .... Sining and Sotcheou, that strong bodies of troops are maintained\" 4).

That the town was not situated against the wall itself, but at some distance away from it may be inferred from Grueber' s answer to the second question of the Archduke, in which after speaking of the walls of the town he continues: \"At a distance of three miles from the walls of the town there is a fort armed with three rows of guns, where foreigners must necessarily pass\" 1). The gate to the empire, there-fore, lay outside the town in some such way as Chiaicuon is the gate to Su-cheu. That Hsi-ning was a fortified town at the time of Grue-ber' s visit we also learn from Martini 2). It is described in detail by Futterer. \"Far below the town one sees for hours the long mono-tonous walls with a few turrets over the gates a.tld at the corners. After passing the first wall the traveller enters upon the wide site of a suburb, covered for the most part with the ruins of houses and other buildings .... Through a second, strong wall one passes from the Dzungarian into the strictly Chinese inner town, where no Mohammedans are allowed to reside'' 8). But, then, are there in the valley of the Hsi-ning-~o no traces of any such wall as is described by Grueber? When relating his visit to the monastery of Chobsen, forty miles north-north-east of Hsi-ning, Prejevalsky says that four and a half miles east of the monastery there was a mud wall with towers as on the northern frontier of Kansu. It was much decayed so they told him and extended from Hsi-ning through Tatung to Kan-chou 4). Sven Hedin likewise mentions ancient walls. Travelling from the Koko Nor to Hsi-ning he traversed the fertile district of Yuan-san. \"Here a partly decayed wall lies right across the valley. It rises to the crests of the lateral mountain ranges allowing a free passage only along the river and having two watch-towers built at that spot. A few kilometres further south, near Cho-yuan, walls are built on either side of the valley on small prominences\" 6). On the map of 0. R. Coales, Compass Route Traverse between Hsi-ning Fu and Kanchou Fu, there is also traced \"an ancient wall and gateway, said to be part of the Great Wall\" 6).

E. Geil. To the west of Hsi-ning he found several relics of an ancient wall which \"does not date back to remote times\"1). He adds that existing chronicles of the district do not speak of that wall, but only refer to more ancient histories which are no longer extant. The Rev. H. F. Ridley a missionary resident at Hsi-ning furnished him with a sketch-map of the probable run of this \"Tibetan loop of the Great Wall\", as Geil calls it. In this sketch the wall is shown with a sudden westerly curve encircling the town, though it does not appear at what distance.-We may, perhaps, here recall the principle which Grueber's sense of fairness applied to Marco Polo: \"It is so long since he died, and as the passing centuries cause a total change in nature, we should not think it strange if we do not see the things in the way in which he described them\" 2). After this fortnight's stay the journey was resumed and Grue-ber and d'Orville entered a practically unknown territory. On the details of this journey to Lhasa we are left in great uncertainty. Broadly speaking there is a choice between two roads. One is called \"the old road\" onHedin'slargemapofTibet,runningfrom Hsi-ning in a south-westerly direction, skirting the Tsaring Nor and the Oring Nor, the two sources of the Hoang-ho, and joining the other road south of the Tangla Range. This second road leads from Hsi-ning to the Koko Nor, loops round the lake on either side, passes over the South Koko Nor Range and runs through the eastern part of Tsaidam basin across the Bajan Gol to the monastery of Dzun-Saysak. The branch running off this road fur-ther on does not concern us here. Be it enough to say that in the end all join the \"old road\" south of the Tangla Range 8). Which of all these was the one taken by our party? If we tum to our sources, the only statement made in the letter to Gamans is to the effect that the journey through the desert of Tartary occupied three months'). Kircher is almost equally laconic. \"Soon after leaving the wall they came to a river abounding in fish, crossed the Hoang-ho and traversed the Kalmack desert, 1) Dr. W. E. Gcil, The Great Wall of China (London 1909) p. 275 ff. There are photo-graphs of some remaining parts of the wall. 0) Kircher, La Chine lllustr.fe, p. 322. 1) Hedin, Ergebnisse, Map 5. Cf.

But here the Italian interview comes to the rescue with fuller details. \"After leaving China he entered the Tartar desert and in a three days' march arrived on the banks of lake Kokonor. This lake resembles the Caspian. From it issues the Yellow River of China, which flows through China with a rapid current to join the sea on the eastern side opposite the island of Korea. It is the largest river of China. Kokonor means great sea [mar grande] in the Tartar language. Leaving its shores the missionary came to the country of Toktokai, almost a desert, which acknowledges no authority, whilst on the other hand no one lays claim to it on account of its great poverty. . . . Through it flows the river Toktokai, whence the country derives its name. The beautiful stream is as wide as the Danube, but it is so shallow that it can easily be forded on horseback\" 2). That this detailed description is due to Grueber can hardly be doubted the country being a terra incognita in Europe at the time; but whose are the evident mistakes? The comparison with the Caspian Sea, which is perhaps sixty times 8) the size of the Koko Nor, is no doubt due to the brackishness of the latter, but the name means 'blue' not 'great' lake. But Grueber's im-perfect acquaintance with the Tartar language, to which he himself confesses, may easily account for this'). Then there is the state-ment that the lake is the source of the Yellow River, whilst it is certain that -it is not. Here, however, Grueber in part corrects himself. He mistakes the Hsi-ning-ho for the Hoang-ho. Tronnier thinks such a mistake impossible both because the Yellow River is a so much mightier stream than the Hsi-ning-ho and because Grueber's estimate of rivers is on the whole so remarkably accu-rate, as will appear further on 6). Yet that he did make it Grueber himself will tell us. In the answer to the second question of the Archduke it is said: \"Three leagues outside the town there is a fort. . . . where foreigners must necessarily pass in order to get across the mountains or across the Yellow River, which is called l) Kircher, ChiHalUuslrata, p. 67. 1) Thevenot, IV, Viaggio, p.

So no doubt can be left about Grueber taking the tributary to be the main stream. But even this does not clear up the whole difficulty, as neither river takes its rise from the Koko Nor, the lake having no outlet at all. As, however, Grueber does not inform us whether he had his information from personal observation or from natives badly informed or badly understood, there is no use in discussing this point further. In the answer just now referred to there is another statement, which is of value for the very reason that it is erroneous. After describing the wall it continues: \"This wall extends from the town to the great lake or sea of Tartary, called Kokonor, from which the Yellow River issues\" 1). These words contain a very strong argument for the authenticity of the Italian report, a com-rn.on error pointing to a common source, which in the present case would be Grueber. On the other hand it is also quite clear from this same answer that not all the errors in the narrative c.f the Italians should be placed to Grueber's account, for while th~y call Korea an island, Grueber declares that Korea \"is a peninsula, not an island, as they wrongly would make us believe in the maps they make.\" If, then, we are safe to assume that the travellers took the Koko Nor road, it remains uncertain which of the alternative loops they followed. Tronnier 2) supposes it was the northern one, for Grue-bcr in his fourth letter, so he argues rather ingeniously, declares never to have seen rhubarb in bloom 8); yet this plant is of com-mon occurence among the mountains south of the lake, and it was during its flowering season that Grueber traversed those parts. On this supposition, then, Grueber's route would coincide with Hue and Gabet's in 1845, Rockhill's in 1889, and Sven Hedin's in the opposite direction in 1896. Obroochev and Futterer skirted the southern border. Having left the Chinese Wall on July 13, 1661, the two Euro-peans reached the lake after three days. 4) No description is given. Prejevalsky, who saw it in 1872, describes it as follows: \"Its shores are very flat and shelving; its water salt and undrinkable. But this saltness imparts an exquisite dark blue colour to the surface, 1) Kircher, La Chine lllustrec, p. 318. 1) Tronnier, p. 339, Note 3, and p. 345.

On the interior of Tibet we only get some generalities. \"This desert-like territory is partly mountainous, partly flat, sandy and exceedingly barren, except for a few strips intersected by small rivers. . . . This desert has several names. Marco Polo calls it Lop .... the Tartars anciently Belgian, at present Sarno, the Chinese Kalmuk, others again Cara-cathai i. e. Black Cathay.

In the third answer it says: \"As regards the country on the other side of the lake, it is so desolate that fields are nowhere to be seen from the town of Sy nim to the king-dom of Barantola, although a road of three months lies between them\" 8). The Italian notice, as quoted above, adds only one item: it speaks of a country and river called Toktokai, which name does not occur elsewhere. It is not found on any map, and the only thing that may possibly guide us is the description of the river, which is said to be as wide as the Danube but very shallow. On the authority of Klaproth Markham supposes that the Toktonai-ulan Muten is here spoken of, one of the upper feeders of the Mur Ussa or Di Chu, as the upper Yang-tse-kiang is called'). In discussing this view Von Richthofen thinks there are no sufficient data for a decision 6). Rockhill, however, when describing the Mur Ussa as \"the gently flowing red river\", adds in a note: \"Father Grueber when travelling to Lhasa crossed this river where the Hsining-Nagchuka road cuts it\" 6). Tronnier cannot agree 7). For when Prejevalsky in 1879 visited the Toktokai-ulan Muren at its junc-tion with the Mur Ussa, he found a width of 10-I 2 fathoms by a depth of one or two feet at the ford 8), whilst Grueber's river is as wide as the Danube though fordable on horseback 9).

But all this, even though the Mur Ussa should occasionally go by the name of Toktonai, cannot quite settle the question, if, indeed, it is capable of settlement; for it can never be more than probable whether, in fact, Linz was the point of the Danube Grueber had in view. Attention should also be drawn to a remark made by Prejevalsky.·When giving the measurements of the Toktonai-ulan Muren he notes that in summer the width may not inconsiderably be increased by the high water flooding the low stretches of land alongside the river. Hence, as Grueber travelled in the summer, probably reaching the ford at the end of August, his description might still apply to the Toktonai 2). The experiences of later explorers must be consulted to give us at least some idea of the dangers and hardships which the travel-lers must have undergone on their way from the Koko Nor to the Tangla Range, and of which our sources leave us in complete ignorance. Crossing the South Koko Nor Range and descending into the salty marshes of the Tsaidam basin they traversed the Baian Gol and may have halted at Dzun Sasak to prepare for the climbing of the Burkhan Buddha Range, the east-wing of the Kuen-Lun. Hue 3) and Prejevalsky 4), though not agreeing in all particulars, are at .one in describing the passage as very difficult, which is not surprising seeing that the Nomokhun Davan pass attains an elevation of 4, 900 metres. But it was only after clearing the Shuga mountains that the travelling-party got into the thick of the terrors of the Tibetan desert. Thisplateauover4,000metres high and broken up by numerous cross-ridges, is strewn with the bones and bodies of beasts of burden and adventurous travellers marking the way for those who come after them, and warning 1) Dutreuil (p. 136) takes the same view. 1) Ney Elias refers Grueber's description to the Bajan Go! in the Tsaidam basin, as described by Prejevalsky, to which it applies very well.

To add to these natural terrors there are wandering marauders, also complained of by Grueber, requiring incessant watchfulness on the part of the toiling wayfarers. '{he crossing of the Baian-Kara Range led them to the banks of the Mur Ussa or the Blue River, which they forded either at the point they had struck or at a higher and more convenient spot, skirting the river bank for some time and perhaps crossing the Toktonai-ulan Muren on their way. This brought Grueber and d'Orville face to face with the huge Tangla Range, which it took Prejevalsky fully eight days to cross, in the course of which he had, moreover, to beat off a fierce attack of plundering Tanguts. \"Slowly,\" he writes, \"the ground rises to one of the highest plateaux of Tibet, the southern edge of which, running from east to west, is formed by mountains covered with etemal!inow, the Tangla range. The ascent and de-scent are very gradual, though the pass followed by the Mongolian caravans lies at an elevation of 4,990 metres. On the whole the gradient is slow enough for a railway line to be laid over the Tangla\" 1). Hue, who does not mention the name of the pass he followed, calls both ascent and descent difficult, especially the latter, which occupied four days 2). It is possible that the more unfavourable impression left upon Hue's mind may in part be due to the exceptional circumstances-under which the passage was made, his companion Gabet having been ill for some time past. At Nag Chu Grueber and d'Orville no doubt changed their beasts of burden, because the road to Lhasa is from this point onward impraticable for camels and horses, which are generally replaced by yaks. After fording the Toktokai, the Italian notice informs us, they first came through the country of Tangut to Retink, a province with a fairly thick population, belonging to the kingdom of Ba-rantola, and at last to the kingdom itself. In Kircher we read that Tangut is the vast territory of Tartary, not a small part of which 1) Ueber den Oberlauf der .fang-tse-kiang und das Tanla-Gebirge -Peterm. Mitteil. (1883) p. 350.

According to Tronnier the name is, as a rule, only applied to the Koko Nor territory 2), which is traversed by a remark made by Father Regis, S. J., \"that the name of Tanguth, which is also found on our maps, is a general name for all the countries from that of the Tartars at the Kokonor .... to the sources of the Ganges\" 3). So there is no valid reason for invert-ing the order of the names of Toktokai and Tangut in the narrative as Tronnier suggests. As regards Retink, Markham surmises that Jang Raiting Gompa, a monastery eighty kilometres north of Lhasa may be meant 4). All our present-day maps do in fact show Reting Gompa south-east of the Tengri Nor, the same name being also used to designate the whole territory. The \"fairly thick popu-lation\" must, naturally, be taken in comparison with the practi-cally uninhabited plateau Grueber had just left behind. Though the fact is not mentioned in the account of the journey we may just point out that the two Jesuits also crossed the towering Transhimalaya Range, probably by the Penpo-la (5,400 metres) 5), if we are to judge from their line of travel through Reting. Later Jesuit cartographers in the reign ot the Emperor Kanghi would learn the general and hazy outline of these stupendous mountain regions, which in 1733 were to find a place in d' Anville's famous map of Tibet or \"Bout-tan\" under the names of Tchimouran, Coiran, Tchompa, etc .. Sven Hedin was the first to determine pn the spot the axis of these ranges. He makes honour-able mention of his predecessors 6).

Three months, therefore, had been spent in travelling from the Great Wall, July 13-0ctober 8. According to Father Desideri Chinese envoys took four months to cover the distance. from Lhasa to Pekin 2), or one month less than our missionaries. AccouPt should be taken, however, of the equipment and the manner of travelling. Thus a former ambassa-dor to the Dalai Lama told Father Gerbillon that he had travelled from Hsi-ning to the Potala in winter in forty-six days 8). Grue-ber's time agrees well with the time taken by Hue and Gabet, who from the end of October till January 29 covered the distance between the Koko Nor and Lhasa'). Sandberg is astonished at the rapid rate of travellip.g of the two missionaries: \"The pair of travel-lers must have made unusually rapid progress; because, accord-ing to their scanty notes, they arrived at Lhasa only three months after quitting Pekin\" 6). This would indeed give cause for wonder. The goal being reached the caravan was disbanded and an op-portunity for continuing their journey had to be looked for, causing a delay of several weeks. Here Kircher and the letter to Gamans are again at variance: the former speaking of two months8), the other of one month 7).

The latitude is given by Kircher at 29° 6', about one half degree less than the calculation of Mont-gomerie's famous Pundit, Nain Sing1). About the government of the country he is a little more communicative and his statements are confirmed by later evidence. There are two kings in this king-dom; one, the Deva (Deba), of ancient Tartar stock, carries on the government; the other, who is worshipped as a deity, lives in seclusion within the precincts of his palace. He is the Great Lama. They did not visit him in person, because a Catholic priest could not conform to the prescribed ceremonial11). Grueber's portrait of the Dalai Lama was done after a picture hung up at the entrance of the palace. But among all his sketches of types of the people, idols etc., of which he made a good many as Kircher's illustratiQns prove, it is his drawing of the famous Potala, Bietala he calls it, that has obtained the widest publicity. It would be hard to say into how many works on '{ibet this picture has found its way, with its curious vehicle in the foreground, which we may suppose is a play of Grueber's fancy or more probably of the designer's, wheeled carriages being unknown among the Tibetans. The curios-ity of those interested in things Tibetan has had to be satisfied with this print till the beginning of the twentieth century when the first photograph of the Potala was given to the world by the Kalmuk, Narzounof£8). From a comparison of Grueber'sdrawing with the numerous later reproductions, especially by members of the British expedition under Colonel Younghusband, it appears that the former saw only the main building completed, and that the two wings are later additions.

Father Desideri, thoroughly qualified by his long s.tay in the country, is as outspoken as Grueber. (Puini, p. 294) Writing about the Dalai Lama from Lhasa October II, 1741, the Capuchin Friar Constantin says. \"Chi puo con questo parlare ed avere di lui piil fetidi escrementi si stima felice.\" (Atti e M emorie del Convegno di Geografi-Orientalisti tenuto ill Macerata ilzs. z6. z7 Settembre I9IO (Macerata 1911) p. 148). Sarat Chandra Das was given two packets of pills after his audience with the Dalai Lama.

Collin de Plancy of Paris in 1825\" (follows the text of the Dictionnaire agreeing in the main with Grueber's words); Waddell, p. 397, note 2.

After four days, Kircher says, they were once more confronted by a high mountain range called Langur. When engaged in its lofty passes, which it is almost im-possible for animals and vehicles to traverse, they could hardly breathe the rarified air, while in summer the poisonous exhala-tions of certain plants endanger the traveller's life. After one month's journey they arrived at Cuthi (Kutti or Nilam Dzong), the first town of the kingdom of Necbal (Nepal) 1). About this Langur, which can only be the Himalaya range, Sylvain Levi remarks as follows: \"Langur is a class-noun meaning 'a mountain range' in the Parbatic language. In their ascent of the high mountain masses rising between K utti and Lhasa both Jesuits and Capuchins heard, on opposite sides, the very same cry from the lips of their guides: Langurt' the mountains!\" 2) And this is the name still in use; all the snow-covered mountains are still called Langur by the Nepal people on the southern face of the Hima-laya. \"The term Himalaya is not used by uneducated people, who only talk of the snowy mountains as Barf ani Langiir\", was the report of the native explorer no. 9 to Montgomerie in 1871 8). From the time-notice, four days, it appears that the travellers crossed the Kampa La (4,700 metres) south of the Tsangpo or Up-per Brahmaputra-no river is mentioned-and thence probably bore westward to Shigatse and Dingri, following the more common yet difficult route to Katmandu. After Shigatse, therefore, where thirty-one years earlier their fellow-Jesuit Father Cacella had died, their route coincides in great part with that of the native explorer Hari Ram in 1871. Traversing the Thang-lang La or \"To do justice to this superstition I ought to add that the common Tibetans are kept entirely in the dark as to the ingredients of the pills; they are taken as medicines prepared by the Grand Lama himself according to a certain secret formula, and the shocking secret is known only to a select few who are entitled to attend the Dalai Lama's court.\" (Kawaguchi, p. 395). 1) Kircher.

These difficulties, however, were thrown into the shade by their five day's march from Nilam to Nesti. What this was like is apparent from the description which Montgomerie gives from the account of the above-mentioned pundit. \"Between Nilam and Listi Bhan-sar he [the pundit] followed the general course of the Bhotia Kosi river [one of the principal affluents of the Sun Kosi] and though it is but some twenty-five miles direct distance ·between the two places, the explorer had to cross the Bhatia river fifteen times, by means of three iron suspension and eleven wooden bridges, each from twenty-four to sixty paces in length. At one place the river ran in a gigantic chasm, the sides of which were so close to one another that a bridge of twenty-four paces was sufficient to span it. This was just below or south of the village of Choksum. Near the oridge the precipices were so impracticable that the path had of necessity to be support~d on iron pegs let into the face of rock, the path being formed by bars of iron and slabs of stone stretching from peg to peg and covered with earth. This extraordinary path is in no place more than eighteen inches and often not more than nine inches in width and is carried for more than one-third of a mile (775 paces) along the ;face of the cliff, at some 1500 feet above the river, which could be seen roaring below in its narrow bed. The explorer, who has seen much difficult ground in· the Hima-laya, says he never in his life met with anything to equal this bit of path. . . . There are several other smaller pieces of paths be-tween Nilam and Listi Bhansar which are nearly so bad, but they are fortunately not continuous\" 1). Such being the circumstances it cannot cause surprise that the two Fathers took eleven days to negotiate the distance between Nilam and Katmandu 2).

This town, the Italian report tells us, is separated fromBaddan, the present Patan, only by a river by which the Baghmati is meant; Kircher, on the other hand, puts half a day's march between the two. As a matter of fact Patan is about three kilometres from the south-eastern point of Katmandu 1). Grueber found the latitude to be 27° 5', which Hari Ram cor-rectedin 1871 to27° 43' 29\"2). On their arrival the travellers found Nepal in the throes of war. The king of Katmandu had leaged his forces with those of his brother Nevagmal, the ruler of Patan. Led by the latter the allied army had taken the field against a petty king, Varcam by name, whose repeated raids were the scourge of the country. Grueber presented Nevagmal with a small spy-glass. Having first spied out the spot where Varcam had en-trenched himself he handed the glass to the prince and made him look in the right direction. Seeing the enemy so close the general at mice gave orders to advance wholly unaware of the optical illu-sion. Of these historical details, for which we are indebted to the Italian report 3), Sylvain Levi found confirmation in the ancient Nepal chronicles. Towards the close of 1659 Pratapa Malia (Partas-mal) and Nivasa Malia (Nevagmal) joined hands to put an end to the inroads of J agat Praka<;a Malia, king of Bhatgaon 4). In November 1660 there was a temporary suspension of hostili-ties, which were continued afresh a year later (November 1661). J agat Praka<;a Malla suffered defeat after defeat, till at last, January 19, 1662, the fortified town of Theni (Timi or Dimi) was taken; the day after the two allied kings returned to their respec-tive capitals 6). Hence Grueber and d'Orville must have arrived in those parts a few days before January 19 at the latest, which is in perfect agreement with the data of our authorities. The presents, especially the spy-glass and some mathematical instruments, had so captivated the king that he was unwilling to let the two Europeans depart and in the end only acquiesced on condition of their returning. If we may anticipate, Grueber must have mentioned this undertaking to Father Roth, his companion 1} Boeck, lmlien, p. 270. 1) RecOJ'ds, part.

About the rest of the journey from Katmandu to Agra our in-formation is very slight and the data derived from our different sources do not complete each other. From Kircher we learn that in five days they travelled from Nepal to Hedonda, a settlement in the kingdom of Moranga, in eight days from this place to Mut-gari, the first town·in theempireoftheGreat Mogul, and thence in ten days to Battana on the Ganges 8). The Italian report summa-rizes as follows: after leaving Nepal they traversed the kingdom of Moranga in five days, proceeded to Minapor, where they crossed the Ganges, which at that point had double the width of the Danube, and arrived at Patana 8). It is, therefore, at the town of Battana, Patana (Patna}, that according to both accounts the two travellers eventually arrived. But the twenty-three days over which the journey is distributed by Kircher, differ widely from the length of time stated in Grueber's answer to the eighth question of the Archduke of Tuscany. After leavir!g Katmandu, he says'), I skirted several terrible mountains and at last after twenty-three days I reached the kingdom of Moranga. I passed only through a pa{t of it and the only thing I saw was one settlement, which is called Hetunda. Then I arrived in ten days in the kingdom of Mogor, that is to say in India on the other side of the Ganges, and at-league's distance I saw the town of Hagiapor, which is the first one meets on coming from Moranga. It is not far from Minapor on the Ganges .... The next town was Batane (Patna).-Thus we have at least 33 days, 23 of which were spent on the route Kat-mandu-Hetunda alone. An error, therefore, there must be, and it is precisely in the time assigned to this last-mentioned stretch that it must be sought. For Hetunda or, as Kircher writes, Hedonda, can hardly be other than Hitounda, which is described by Brian Hodgson in the Bengal Selections 6), and for which Sylvain Levi 8) 1) Stticklein, I, 113. 1) Kircher, China Illustrata, p. 65. *) TMvenot, IV, Vjaggio, p. ~-. 1) Kircher, La Chine lllustr~e, p. 3'21. 1) Bengal Selections, XXVII (185.7) p. 2~. \"l Levi, I, 86."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"196 JOHN GRUEBER AND ALBERT D'ORVILLE and Kurt Boeck 1) write Hetaura.

That 23 days should be required to cover this distance is inconceivable even in a mountain region. Travelling in the opposite direction Boeck went from Hetaura to Katmandu in 2 days, but he pressed forward as fast as he could making SO kilometres in one day. Kircher's five days, then, may safely be taken to be correct'). The kingdom of Moranga is, says Markham, probably the same as Muring or Tarai, the swampy region between the mountains and the plain. Levi 6) on the other hand identifies it with the kingdom of Makwampur, probably on account of a remark in The-venot's report to the effect that the kingdom of Maranga had to pay to the Great Mogul a yearly tribute of 250,000 tallari and 7 elephants7). As regards the other stopping places, Minapor, which is mentioned both in the Italian report and in the eighth answer, cannot from its situation on the Ganges be otherwise than Dina-pur. The discrepancy between Kircher calling Mutgari, probably Motihari, the first town of the empire of the Mogul reached by Grueber, and the eighth answer mentioning Hagiapur {Hajipur) as such, may be considered as of minor importance. The two way-worn travellers no doubt spent a few days at Pat-na of which the ever active Grueber availed hiJllself to determine the latitude of the town, which he found to be 24° 44', the present determination being 25° 37' $). It may be mentioned in passing that nearly all of Grueber's latitudes are too low by 30' on an average.

Grueber's high esteem of his friend is sufficiently proved by the eulogy he wrote in memory of him, March 29, 1664, on his arrival at Rome. He pays tribute to his many gifts of soul and body, his holy life, his patience, and especially to his unfailing cheerfulness in the midst of the greatest trials of the journey, the success of which was in great part owing to him 1). The differences between Kircher's account and the Gamans-letter have so far prevented any agreement as to the duration of the journey from Pekin to Agra. The former calculates 214 days of travel between the two towns, but adds that the addition of the days of rest would carry the time to one year and two months 2). In his letter on the other hand, while stating at. the outset that he left Pekin April13, 1661, Grueber concludes by saying, \"Here [at Agra] some rest could be taken after eleven months spent on the way from China\" 3). The point that could not be settled was: were these months to be counted from Hsi-ning or from Pekin? A reference to the dates now known to us will furnish the solution.

With-out stopping long the indefatigable Grueber took his companion through Mekran and Karman to the island of Ormuz. From this point onward the road by Bender-Abbas through Mesopotamia to Smyrna was known to him. About the exact date of their arrival there has been much uncertainty. In Roth's letter written from Rome in 1664 and already referred to, he writes that he arrived there a short time before the battle of St. Gothard 4), and as Monte-1) Holdich (p. 72) has the following somewhat puzzling passage: \"From Lhasa to India was a journey of one 01: two months (Grueber speaks of one month, but Kir· cher makes it two, which is the more probable if Agra was the terminus).\" For it is a fact that the journey from Lhasa to Agra took three months at least. Is it, perhaps, that Holdich has mistakenly referred the time of rest at Lhasa to the journey Lhasa-Agra? For Grueber does, indeed, speak of a month's stay at Lhasa, whilst Kircher speaks of two months. 1) Henry Roth was born at Dillingen, December 18, 1620, and entered the Society of Jesus October 25, 1639. He left for India in 1650 and was at Smyrna in 1651 ;hence he proceeded to Goa via lspahan. Being first engaged in mission work at Salsette near Goa he was transferred in 1656 to the Mogor Mission, first to Srinagar in Garhwal, af-terwards to Agra, where by the time of Grueber's arrival he had governed the Jesuit College since 1659. -Having arrived at Rome and settled his affairs he immediately set out with Grueber on his return-journey. When Grueber was compelled by illness to stay behind at Constantinople, Roth continued his way alone and was back in the Mogor Mission certainly before November 1667. For in the catalogue of that date his name has the following note appended: \"Nunc destinatus ad auspicandam missionem Napalensem.\" His work, however, was well-nigh ended. He died June 20, 1668, at Agra being under forty-eight years of age. This date is certain, not only from the Catalogus Defunctorum but also from the epitaph in the Martyrs' chapel in the Padritola church· yard. He was one of the·first Europeans to obtain a great mastery of Sanskrit as was noted already in the 'Rela~ao da Missao do Mogor del 1668' by F. Manuel do Valle. Between p. 162-163 of Kircher's China lllustrata there are inserted five fuU-pagc cop-perplate engravings containing the alphabet and elements of Sankrit, the originals of which were drawn by Roth himself. They are the first specimens of Sanskrit ever printed in Europe. -There is an able essay on Roth from the pen of Prof. Seb. Eurin-ger in ]ahrbuch des Historischen Vereins (Ditlingen 1918). 3) Letter to F. john Paul Oliva at Rome, dated Messina January 18, 1664. •) Stocklein, I, 113."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"200 JOHN GRUEBER AND ALB.ERT D'ORVILLE cucoli gained his victory over the Turks near St. Gothard on the Raab August 1, 1664, these words might be understood to point to July or June. But there was the fact of Grueber being at Venice on his way back to China and writing from that place to Kircher as early as May 10, 1664, and of his eulogy on d'Orville being dated Rome March 29, 1664. Clearly, therefore, Roth's statement was not to be taken too narrowly, and Grueber's arrival in tl).e Eternal City was generally referred to the beginning of 1664 or the close of 1663. Fortunately every doubt is settled by a letter written by one Father G. Kaut on February 23, 1664 and probably addressed to some one in Germany 1). He writes that the two travellers arrived safely at Rome February 20, 1664. Grueber had brought with him a Chinese, Roth a native of Mogor eighty-five years of age. The for-mer had been on the road for three years, and from his account the overland route he had taken, though longer, was much safer and healthier than the sea-route. The tireless Gueber scorned all rest. Arriving late in February he was again on his way back to China in the following May. On the 1Oth of that month he wrote to Kircher from Venice. They (himself and Roth) had arrived on the sixth of that month intend-ing to take ship for the East. Four ships were about to sail, so there was no time to make proper preparations; on account of the war there was, moreover, great danger of their falling into the hands of the Turks. These circumstances and the advice of others had determined them to go to Poland with the object of reaching Persia through Moscovia, thus avoiding Turkish territory 2). By way of Breslau and Danzig he went to Kurland, but learning on his arrival at Mitau that the empire of the Tsars was distracted by domestic troubles and the road to Astrakan barred by Tartars, he modified his plans, and, still having Roth as his companion, returned to Vienna and proceeded to Constantinople. But even Grueber's iron constitution could not bear up against the ex-cessive fatigues of these interminable wanderings. He was taken seriously ill, and while Roth continued his journey to India by himself Grueber had to sail back to Leghorn and Florence, in which latter town the much-cited interview took place. 1) Munich State L~brary, Cod.

They found in him a generous patron and benefactor. Not only did he give letters of recommendation for the dukes of Kurland and Moscow, but writing to the General of the Society of Jesus, Father Paul Oliva, September 17, 1664, Leopold I. declared that as the Dutch patrolled the ocean high-ways - and, perhaps, also to break the Portuguese monopoly -he accepted the patronage of the new overland route, by which some Fathers had already safely travelled to and from China; and that he wished his yearly contribution towards the equipment of missionaries to be earmarked for this route 1). Of Grueber's subsequent career we know next to nothing. He did not return to the Far East; but why? Was he so broken down in health that it was feared he would not be able to bear the fatigues and dangers of a fresh journey? Or were there other reasons opposing his return? We cannot say. From Grueber himself we only learn that after his recovery he returned to the Austrian pro-vince of his order 2), but no reasons are given. Drawing on one of his unpublished letters we stated above, that for two years he was engaged as an army-chaplain to the imperial troops in Transsyl-vania, and that from September 1669 he was at fyrnau and Trencsin, from which latter place he wrote to Kircher May 2, 1671. After this, all information is wanting, whence the variety of dates to which his death is assigned. The year 1665, which has been adopted by many 3), need not be considered. The Jesuit list of de-parted members gives 1684, which is also held by Tronnier and Heawood.But as against these there isSommervogel, who corrected his first date of 1665 into September 30, 1680 placingGrueber's death at Patak.

The curious reader might turn to the only reference sup-plied, the translation of a letter written from Lhasa, April 10, I7I6, in the Lettres Edifiantes 1), but he would rise from its peru-sal with an intense feeling of disappointment: not a word about the long journey through the Tsangpo valley, not a word, worst of all, about Lhasa itself. It was the tantalizing incompleteness in this as in other documents that drew from Yule's pen the com-plaint that \"a fatality has attended the accounts of Lhasa that should have been.\" This was in I 866. Ten years later, in his book on Bogle and Man-ning, Clements Markham surprised his readers with the welcome statement that a manuscript of Desideri had been discovered at Pistoja, which was soon to be given to the public by the Hakluyt Society. Circumstances, however, prevented this plan from being carried out and nothing was done till in I 904 it was edited by the learned Professor Carlo Puini 2). So far it has not met with the acknowledgment it deserves. Perhaps it is the flood of light which of late years has been thrown on modern Lhasa, especially by the expedition of Sir Francis Y ounghusband, which has relegated the more ancient records into a temporary obscurity. This neglect has not been without its attendant loss of historical truth and scientific accuracy, which however excusable in earlier writings, 1) Lettres VII, 259-268. •) ll Tibet (Geografia, Storia, Religione, Costumi) secondo la Relazione del Viaggio del P.

The MS. edited by Puini is at present in the Bibliotheca Nazio-nale of Florence; it is addressed to an unnamed missionary whom Desideri had met in the Carnatic mission. It contains 630 pages running on without any break till suddenly towards the end the headings: chapter 13, 14, 15 appear. For more convenient hand-ling the editor divides the narrative into sections, but unfortuna-tely their criss-cross arrangement renders a continuous reading of the journal impossible. Though the Florence MS. is in many places less clear and full than those cited in the list appended to this chap-ter and used by the present writer, still, as it is the only one in print and it may suit the reader to check the author's statements and conclusions, a reference will be given whenever it parallels a quo-tation from the MSS. A. or B 1). What was the occasion of Desideri's journey, what was the reason of this renewed interest• in the Tibetan mission? These questions which have often been asked and never been answered, can now be settled. From the third chapter the reader will remember the extinction of the Tsaparang mission. Since the time when Manuel Marques was a lonely prisoner there in 1641 it had been forbidden ground, but the hope of a future return had never been extinguished. Things remained as they were, till the man of push and position required to take up the matter, was found in Father Michael de Amaral2). On March: 30, 1704, he was appointed Visitor to the Goa mission-province, and on studying the situation he resolved to re-establish the Tsaparang mission. Father Manuel Monteiro was commissioned to inquire at Agra about the most suitable route and to gauge the chances of success of a fresh effort 3). When he died in 1707 he had not done more than gather some information from Armenian traders about the most practicable roads. As Amaral meanwhile had been relieved of his post in 1706, the whole plan &eemed off. But when he was again appointed Visitor in 1707 two young Goa missionaries, Fathers Carvalho and Gill, 1) Seep. 275-281.

Though they did not see their wishes fulfilled, the Visitor's influence continued to be felt. For on De-cember 15,1708, theProvincialManuelSarayainformed the Gene-ral that at the instance of F. de Amaral he had appointed John Carvalho and Peter de Torres for Tibet, but had been forced by the death of two missionaries in Maysore to send them thither to supply the vacancies. Rome favoured and even urged the return to the old mission-field as appears from a letter of the General F. Tamburini of July 6, 1709 2). Probably before receiving this letter, on January 3, 1710, Sa-raya informed the General that Fathers Joseph Martinetti and Francis Koch had been charged to undertake a new venture from Agra-though in fact nothing came of it-and on December 28, 1710 he re-affirmed his diligence in the matter 8). Such was the state of affairs when on September 27, 1713, Father Desideri dis-embarked at Goa. Born at Pistoja December 21, 1684, Ippolito Desideri entered the Society of Jesus April27, 1700. After his ordination August 28, 1712, he set out from Rome for Lisbon on September 27 in company with Father Hildebrand Grassi 4). At Genoa they were joined by Father Francis del Rosso and about the middle of March the party arrived at Lisbon, where the three took ship for India April 6, 17 I 3 5).

Nee deterreant ullae difficultates, nam causa Dei est, qui iam stcmit viam per Mogolense imperium\" -quoted in Desideri's leUer from Goa November 15, 1713. 1) There is no need to dwell on the undertaking of the two last-mentioned missiona-ries. Writing from Daman to the General November 29, 1713, Martinetti sums up under four heads the reasons for giving up that mission. He concludes with an appeal for his recall to Europe \"since he has deserved better than to live an exile in this strange land.\" Evidently this man was not the stuff of which missionaries are made and that he could be mistaken for a possible successor to an Andrade seems, to say the least, somewhat surprising. 1) Hildebrand Grassi was born at Bologna in 1683 and became a Jesuit at Rome January 23, 1699.

His letters rather go to show that he had not. Thus when writing to the General on November 12and 15, 1713,heinforms him that he has been chosen and destined for the new mission by the Provincial and that he is delighted at the appointment. He then urges the General to address him a special letter confirming the appointment and order-ing him (Desideri) explicitly to open the mission of Tibet and to act in all this under direct responsibility to Rome; thus he will be able to overcome all the difficulties that may be raised against the undertaking 2). Six weeks later he returns to this point 3). A constructive reading, therefore, of Desideri's letters would point to this sequence: first the Provincial at Goa made up his mind that the mission should be re-established, after which Desi-deri very likely volunteered, as he had done already before lea V'ing Europe, and was accepted; he then sought authority for his enter-prise directly from Rome. We might now set about exammmg Desideri's geographical work, but such aspersions have been cast on his name-and not on his only -that no writer of credit could pass them over in silence; he must repeat or repulse the charges, not indeed on hearsay but on historical evidence. What then is the case? In 1702 Tibet had been assigned as a mission-field to the Capuchins and in 1707 two of them had reached Lhasa through Nepal. They left again in 1711 and on their return in October 1716 they found Desideri in residence, who had travelled by way of Leh and Gartok and had arrived there some six months before.

Desideri meanwhile stayed at Lhasa or in the Capuchin house in Takpo-Khier on the best of terms with his hosts. When in 1721 he received orders from Rome to leave Tibet, he went at once. At Rome meanwhile the affair had been placed before the competent ecclesiastical tribunal, and Desideri on his return urged the claims of his Order, who had been the first to missionize Tibet, till in 1732 decision was given in favour of the Capuchins. These events have led some modern authors to ascribe the jour-ney to motives frankly dishonourable. Thus Sandberg bluntly tells his readers that \"an agent of the Society\" was sent \"in the hope of being able to discredit the same\" 1) i. e. the Capuchins. Which assertion Sir Thomas Holdich does not shrink from improving upon by saying that Desideri went \"to-inquireintotheworkingof the Capuchin missions and to discredit them as far as possible\" 1). Landon, short and sweet, stamps Desideri and his companion \"Jesuit spies\", which is evidently the main thing his historical conscience prompts him to say on the subject 8). As against these asseverations we first of all plead the absence of so much as a shred of evidence for those sweeping condemnations i we secondly refer to the audience granted by the Pope, who gave his blessing over Desideri's enterprise; we thirdly point out that Desideri was never sent to Lhasa at all, so that it is beating the air for a writer to hunt for motives why he was sent there.

Desideri will tell us presently what finally decided him, but we may point out that poth Freyre, the superior of the travelling-party, and Desideri had clearly but very vague notions of the place where Andrade's mission had been and of Tibetan geography in general, while at the same time it is antecedently improbable, from their line of travel through Kashmir and Ladakh, that from the outset Lhasa can have been their goal.

Accustomed to the Indian climate and worn with fatigue and hardship the latter only desired to get back to Mogor at the earliest opportunity. He did not care to take the road he had come. On inquiring about the possibility of going back by way of Srinagar and learning that this would take him through the mountains, he cast about for other possible routes and these investigations led to the discovery that besides Little and Great Tibet there was a greater one yet, the capital of which was Lhasa. It would take three months to reach. Freyre knew there were Capuchins there, but he also knew that from that place Mogor was easier to reach than from where he was now. This made him resolve to go 1). Desideri is against it. He does not want to go back to Mogor, but to do mission work in Tibet; moreover, in that third Tibet there are missionaries already, so there is no need for others to go there 2). Freyre does not insist but leaves him free to stay in Ladakh on his own responsibility; Freyre himself will go to that third Tibet, where Father Andrade was once, because such is the mind of the Superiors 3). Thus placed before the alternative either to stay where he is or to go on and help to re-establish the mission of Andrade, Desideri gives way and resolves to go with Freyre. Thus it was that the two travelled to Lhasa, and thus it is that the idea of espionage or discrediting the Capuchins was as far away from their minds as the pens of Sandberg, Holdich an Landon travelled away from historical truth when they wrote down their unfounded charges.

Proceeding to Dehli March 26, he arrived at this place May 1 I. As the wet season rendered further travelling impossible for some three or four months he made a trip to Agra and was back at Delhi by the end of August. Meanwhile Freyre had also arrived here and on September 24 the two set their faces north-ward for Lahore, from whence crossing the Pir Panjal Range they reached the town of Caximir, the present Srinagar, November 13, 1714 1). Desideri gives a detailed description of this town, the Venice of India, standing in its wonderful plain of the Jehlam with its belt of lakes and delightful gardens, thriving on its traffic in wool and its world-famous shawls. On his arrival winter was fast approaching closing up the mountain passes. His health, moreover, had been severely shaken by repeated haemorrage of the lungs. So there was nothing for it but to await a better season and his enforced leisure of some months was used to ground himself in Persian. Provided with the necessary passports and letters of recommendation for the king of Ladakh they resumed their journey on May 17, 1715 with three Christian servants and an interpreter; a twelve days' journey took them to \"a very high mountain called Conte!, on whose top the first or Little Tibet begins\" 2). The next day, being in that year Ascension-day, the ascent was begun amid a heavy fall of snow and it was night before they came upon the first settlement at the other side.

The first stopping-place on the Tibetan side is the hamlet of Matayan, six-teen miles from Dras, where no doubt our travellers stayed for the night 11). This first or Little Tibet, Desideri continues, is called Baltistan in the vernacular. It is not very wide in extent. To the south it borders on Mogol, in the west and the north on some parts of Turkestan, towards the north-east it extends as far as Caxkar (Kashgar) and eastward it touches on the second Tibet, Lhata-yul (Ladakh). First divided into some princedoms it has these thirty years been under Mohammedan rule. Though the language differs somewhat from that of the third Tibet (Utsang), it is in all essentials the same. There are no towns, but villages and hamlets, and most of the houses are half sunk into the ground. The country produces only barley, wheat and some vegetables, but no fruit except apricots. At one time the people professed the same religion as the inhabitants of the rest of Tibet, but during the Mogul domi-nation most have passed over to that sect.

Towards the east it extends as far as the great desert, of which I shall speak later. In the south it touches on the territories of Collahor [Kulu], Sirenagar [Garhwal] and others. The language and religion agree with those of the third Tibet. Having first consisted of small kingdoms, such as Coghe [Guge], Redoc or Retoa, Lhata and others, the whole of it is now subject to Lhata [Ladakh]. The whole country is mountainous, fairly unproductive, and has but a scant population. It produces plenty of barley, little wheat, and as regards fruit, chiefly apricots. Trade with other countries is very insignificant, and is limited to a very fine wool, a small quantity of gold-bearing sand and musk. ... Trees and wood-fuel are scarce, cattle plentiful. The staple food is roasted barley-meal and meat, whilst the popular drink is Ciang [Chang], a kind of beer made from barley 1). Tea, however, is drunk several times a day. Their wearing apparel is of wool. Their natural disposition is not proud, but docile, polite, cheerful and kind. There are numerous monaste-ries with many monks, all of whom live under a chieflama. To attain to this dignity, however, study in one of the universities of the greatest Tibet is necessary, which, indeed, is required of every one who wants to rise .... There are no large towns, but only villages, farmsteads and castles, with the one exception of Lhe or Lhata, the capital both of the King and of the Chief-Lama of this king-dom. This town, situated in a wide plain entirely surrounded by mountains and studded with villages, is built up the slope of a mountain up to the residence of the Chief-Lama and the palace of the King, large and fine buildings.

The route followed from Baltistan to Leh is not accurately traced by Desideri. The first places in Ladakh were ruled, we learn, by a petty independent Mohammedan prince, who received them well in his fortified hill-top town. He even gave them an escort to send them safely across one of those rope bridges of plaited willow twigs, which is minutely described by Desideri, for though we are at present amply acquainted with these kind of structures, to him it was something unique 2). A few days later they reached an important town, where the son of the Longbo, or first minister, of Ladakh was governor. The names of these two places cannot be more than guessed at. Puini supposes them to be the fortress of Dras and the monastery-town of Lamayuru, but whatever be said of the last conjecture, the first can hardly be maintained as Desideri considers Dras to be a town of Baltistan. In the writer's opinion Kargil in the Mohammedan part of Ladakh would be a likely halting-place 3). Forty days after their departure from Srinagar the party entered Leh. The many hardships of such a march on foot along frightful roads had exhausted Freyre's endurance, and no sooner had he arrived than he tried to find out if there was any pos-sibility of returning to Mogor by another road.

(Moorcroft II. 22). The device on the cover of the book evidently points to its Jesuit origin, but from the date 1599 it can hardly be supposed to have been carried out to Tibet by Desideri in 1715; it would rather have been left there by Father Azevedo during his visit to Leh in 1631.

Only once the harmony threatened to be disturbed when it was given out by merchants from Kashmir that 'those two poor foreigners were disguised traders carrying large quantities of precious pearls. An inquiry, however, soon settled these stories. In his Relazione Desideri does not mention the name of the king, but in his Lhasa-letter to Grassi he calls him Nima Nangial1), the same therefore as Nyi-ma-nam-gyal, the great-grandson ofSeng-genam-gyal, as appears from Dr. Marx's Ladakh documents 2). On August 17, 1715, they proceeded again on their great jour-ney, this time on horseback and with guides. Soon they entered upon the wide plains called in the vernacular Ciang-Thang or 'northern plain'. They are covered partly with {j.ead and foul water, partly with veins of sulphur and pools of sulphurous water. The rotten water and tainted air are very dangerous both for men and horses and cause such violent swellings of the gums and lips as sometimes to endanger life. Relief and cure for man and beast can only be obtained from the chewing of various herbs, especially aloe. On the evening of September 7 the caravan took up its quar-ters at Tre~scy-Khang \"Casa dell'Allegrezza\", the first strongly fortified frontier-town of the third or greatest Tibet 3). Ciang-Thang or Chang-tang 'the Northern Plain', is the general name comprising the whole of the table-land of northern Tibet. \"This is the region of highest elevation too high and too cold for anything but pastoral use, where salt-lakes are scattered at inter-vals amidst vast sterile flats, where grass is scanty and trees are absolutely wanting\" 4). The mere mention of this plain, however, still leaves a considerable choice of route. It is unlikely that our trav~llers have taken the direct road through the Indus valley judging from the distance and the time of actual travel; for the road from Leh to Tre~scy-Khang, the present Tashigong, some five miles below the point where the Singh-gi and Gartang Rivers join to form the Indus, is only 275 miles, which it would have taken them three weeks to cover. Now Hedin was told on good authority that the journey from Lehto Gartok, about 70 miles beyond Tashi-gong, is reckoned at only 22 caravan-days 5).

With a view to the dangerous journey through the sterile wastes that lay before them, they now looked about at Tashigong for a caravan which they might join; luck served them beyond all expectation. At a distance of two days, Desideri tells us, in a large plain called Cartoa a strong, permanent force of Tartar and Tibetan soldiers was stationed not only for the defence of the frontier-fortress of Treescy-Khang and the surrounding settle-ments, but more especially to watch all those who from that side entered the country. The commander, a Tartar prince, had died and his widow had taken over the command till a new governor should arrive. When about to return to Lhasa, she came for a last inspection to Treescy-Khang. Our travellers at once applied for permission to travel under the protection of her numerous retinue, which was readily granted, and starting on October9they arrived two days later at Cartoa 2). That Cartoa is the present Gartok there is no doubt. Though Desideri connects the name only with the plain, there can be no difficulty in admitting one name both for a settlement and the surrounding country, or rather for a two-branched settlement and the intervening tract of country. For as Rawling tells us, \"Gartok in reality consists of two different places situated forty miles apart. The one we visited is known as Gar Yarsa or Summer Quarters and the other which is also on the Indus but at a lower altitude Gar Gunsa or Winter Quarters\" 3). These topographical remarks will also settle any doubt as to the feasibility of covering in two days the seventy miles that separate Tashigong from Gar-tok; to reach Gar Gunsa or the \"Winter Gartok\" they only had to travel thirty miles.

On the 9th of November they reached \"the highest region we have traversed during the whole of our peregrinations. It is a complete desert, called Ng-nari Giongar, and is held in the highest veneration on account of a certain Urghien, the founder of the Tibetan religion. Away from the road there stands an enormously high mountain, very wide in circumference, its summit hidden among the clouds, covered ·with perpetual snow and ice, and most terrible on account of the icy cold. In a cave of that mountain, according to the legend, there lived the above-mentioned Urghien in absolute retirement and uninterrupted meditation. In his honour this cave has been changed into a temple, which has a rude unshapely monastery attached to it, the residence of a lama and some monks of the sect, who serve the temple. Not only do the Tibetans visit the cave; where they invariably leave some presents, but with very great inconvenience to themselves they make the round of the whole mountain, an occupation of some days, by which they gain what I might call great indulgences\" 1). For the first time from the pen of a European we have here mentioned and described one of the most sacred spots of Buddhist Tibet. For this \"mountain of Urghien\" is the Kang-Rinpoche or Kailas, 22,028 feet high, the seat of the gods for the religious world of Central-Asia, around whose base foregather weary pilgrims from the farthest corners of the Tibetan uplands and the Hima-layan fastnesses, that by a visit to the monastery and a round of the mountain they may be protected from all evil for the rest of their lives 2). For the most complete and best-illustrated description of this mountain the reader should turn to Sven Hedin's third journey in 1907 3). Personally he made the circuit along the pilgrim road, which it takes an ordinary pedestrian two days to complete.

As regards Urghien, whose memory is venerated here, he is better known by his In-dian name of Padmasambhava 'the Lotus-born one', or by that of Guru Rinpoche, 'the precious Guru' given him by the Tibetans. He is the founder of Lamaism and was given the surname of U gyan or Urgyan, because he was a native of Udyana or Urgyan, which term, according to Yule not only denotes Udyana north of Peshawar but the whole hill region south of the Hindu Kush between Chitral and the Indus 2). Desideri is perfectly correct in describing the parts he was now traversing as the highest of his journey, for by the Jer-ko La, a pass 16,200 feet high but not difficult of access, he had entered upon the inhospitable wastes of the province of Ngari, where the proud Kailas rears its giant height. Rawling, who traversed this region in the beginning of December, describes it as a barren and desolate country. \"Grass undoubtedly grows in great profusion during the summer months, though at the time of our visit it was all dead and withered, herds of goats picking up here and there their scanty sustenance of the shrivelled blades. As grass decreased in quantity so the prickly scrub proportionately increased, covering the lower slopes of the mountains and the hollows in the plains and growing at times in such profusion as to almost obliterate the track\" 3). Continuing their route across this high plateau the caravan reached a sandy plain called Toscioa 4), with some roaming herds of yaks and horses belonging to the Great Lama and the King. After a two days' rest in the first days of December, the party drew near another holy spot, the sacred lake of Mansarowar, famous in Hindu mythology. The journal dwells on this part at length. \"A little further we traversed a plain called RetOa, in which is situated a large lake, some days' march in circumference, from which the Ganges is supposed to take its rise.

For as this is the highest spot from which the land sinks down on both sides, the water, whether from rainfall or thaw, which runs down the western slopes, flows towards the secord Ti-bet [Ladakh] as experience most clearly shows. Thence it goes to Baltistan, breaks through the mountains of Kashmere and at last reaches Little Guzzarat, there to form the broad and navigable Indus. In like manner the water that flows down the eastern side of Ng-nari Giongar, first enters lake Retoa, thence takes its course downwards and thus gradually becomes the Ganges. To this a conjecture may be added 1). Famous in the writings of our forefathers are the gold-bearing sands of the Ganges. But the sup-position that this river has its source elsewhere would take away all ground for their statement and make it into a fabrication, since in no other part of the river the slightest vestige of such sand is to be found. If, on the other hand, my view be accepted, that the origin of the Ganges is to be sought in the Ng-nari Giongar moun-tains and in the lake Retoa - also called Redok -2) their asser-tion is in accordance with the truth. \"For it is known-I may say all over the world-thaton the shores and in the sands of this lake large quantities of gold-dust are found, which is carried down by the drainage of the Ng-nari Giongar and other intervening mountains. Tibetan and other merchants come to the lake from time to time to search for and collect the gold, which brings them a good profit. \"This lake, moreover, is held in high veneration by the supersti-tious people. In consequence they sometimes go there on pil-grimage and with great devotion walk round it, thinking thus to gain great indulgences, if I may so express myself\" 3). It is at once clear from this first description 4) of the Mansa-rowar lake (for no other lake can be meant), whose hydrographic import has raised so many discussions, that Desideri had not broken away from the tradition of the ages as regards the origin of 1) \"S'aggiugne a cio una conjettura.\" In the Puini MS. \"confirmasi cio da una par-ticolariHt\". \"l This parenthesis is not in Puini, where there are also some other minor discre-pancies. 3) Desideri, MS.

The Sutlej River was the Ganges and for the honour of antiquity it must remain so, though Desideri's opinion may also have been influenced by the name Ganga or Nganga, by which the channel joining the Mansarowar lake and Rakas Tal is still known at the present day. But no one has a right to reproach Desideri with this error. \"Who could require of him, that in two days' time he should have fully investigated those wonderful wa-tercourses on which explorers and travellers have been at issue for two centuries afterwards. I have spent more time exploring the country about the lakes than any of my predecessors, and to me it gives a sense of restfulness and refreshment when in Father Desideri's old journal I again come across 'illago di RetOa' \"1). But whence the name Retoa? Hedin remarks that \"Retoa or Redoc is Rudok, a name which he has heard and either misunder-stood or misplaced when writing his narrative \"2), which is plausi-ble and may be correct. Perhaps a hint for another solution may be found in the name Reta-puri 3), which is given by Ekai Kawa-guchi as the name of a place in the upper-Sutlej, and which may be supposed to have had reference in Desideri's time to the whole of the lake country.

Both the King and the Great Lama derive great profits from it. In the first place tolls are taken from all passing travellers 4). Then, there is fairly large quantity of gold found and the nume-rous herds, that find their sustenance on those plains, yield an abundance of excellent butter. Nain Singh observed that \"from the Manasarowar to Ralung, 400 miles, there were no villages and no cultivation of any kind.

As the Tartar princess was taken ill here and the missionaries were not permitted to proceed by themselves, their journey was not resumed till January 28, when it was continued through a better country with many small villages and with only two large towns, Secchia and Giegazze, at each of which they stayed a few days. At length ten months after their departure from Srinagar the roofs of the mighty Potala loomed before the eager eyes of the travellers and on March 18, 1716, they set foot within the holy city of Lhasa 2). Having reached his goal Desideri, quite naturally, casts a look back on the long and laborious journey and recounts at length the tale of his experiences: the difficulties of supply, the want of fuel, life in a tent, the unbearable cold, the ,difficult, sometimes im-practicable roads through snow and ice, the care of the horses, of which he lost five out of seven between Leh and Lhasa - all this and much more is passed in review 3). But these need not to de-tain us here; narratives of like experiences are accessible to the reader in any modem book of Tibetan travel, though it should never be forgotten that through their ignorance of mountain-travel, its conditions, its difficulties and dangers these two pioneers had to struggle against far heavier odds than the well-read, well-equipped and often well-experienced mountain-travellers of mo-dem times. Nor should we forget another feature, which even in the case of the present-day explorer is singled out for special mention. In the discussion following Ryder's lecture at the Royal Geo-graphical Society Sir Francis Y ounghusband and other speakers specially emphasised how much more arduous Ryder's journey had become on account of this fact alone that it had been per-formed at the beginning of the cold season, Gyangtse being left on October 10 to arrive at Gartok on December 10 4).

For weeks on end his route has lain along the southern base of the Transhimalaya mountains, yet he has practically nothing to remark on this huge range. He knows the Kallas, men-tions the mountains round Lhasa, but never even hints that the whole of his route from Mansarowar to Lhasa is bordered by mountains on its northern side; it is only the Himalaya, Langur as he calls it with Grueber, which he thinks worth mentioning. Is not this strange? Not so to one who has traced Desideri's steps, is Sven Hedin's answer. The difficulties of its crossing stamp the Himalaya on the mind beyond all possibility of effacement. But with the Transhimalaya things are otherwise. It is only from two points down in the deep river-valley that it is specially impress-ive, along the rest of the route the nearest mountains which shut off the main ridge are not remarkably high, and one may pass alongside of them without even a suspicion of the gigantic range beyond 1). Father Freyre meanwhile had not given up the plan of which he had been frustrated at Leh. Closer acquaintance had not reconciled him to the climate, and the intense cold and the thin air of the Tibetan highlands proved too much for a constitution already weakened by a stay of many years in the tropics. On reaching Lhasa he hardly allowed himself a few days' rest before he returned to Hindustan through Nepal 2). Thus Desideri was left behind the only European at Lhasa 3).

On October I, more than six months after Desideri's arrival, another party of three reached the capital of Tibet via Nepal, where they were received by him and instructed in the language of the country 2). In a summary of some twenty pages Desideri gives a general survey of his stay and activity in Tibet; the chief points of which may find a place here before we pass on to a discussion of the detailed geographical notes furnished by the rest of the journal3). Within a few days after Freyre's departure he was summoned to the palace by an order of the king and cross-questioned by the commander-in-chief, Zze-ring-ton-drup as to the object of his coming. About a month later, May I, he had a personal audience with the king, and was granted permission·to preach 4). He was scant and almost cavalier treatment of Desideri by Sir Thomas Holdich, the more so as the latter can see and appreciate true merit. After he has discredited the object of the journey, to which we have referred at the beginning of this chapter, it almost looks as if he wishes to \"damn with faint praise\" the performance itself, for he continues thus: \"Desideri entered Tibet by Ladakh and as he was something of an observer and a writer, we have some most interesting records from his pen of the nature of the now well-known route to Leh.\" The journey beyond Leh, the stay at Lhasa, the descrip· tion of Utsang are hardly mentioned, yet Puini's book with Desideri's extensive jour· nal is noticed in the bibliography.

(Cf. Geographical Journal XXXVIII (1911) p. 361-362) It is no dispar-agement of the merits of these men to say that the omission of Desideri's name in this connection is an injustice; his title to be ranked with them cannot be questioned and the position taken up by Sir Thomas Holdich can to my mind only be explained from insufficient acquaintance with the missionary's writings. 1) Cf.

With undivided zeal Desideri now addressed himself to the study of the language. \"From that day to the last which I passed in that kingdom I studied from morning till night\". Nor without success, for by the end of December of the same year he had finished an expose of the Christian religion in Tibetan, which was presented to the king at an audience on January 6, 1717. Acting on the advice of the latter to study the religion of the lamas in their own writings, Desideri stayed from March 25 to the end of July at the monastery of Ramo-cce, where he was chiefly engaged in the study of the Kaa-n-ghiur, \"gli oraculi tradotti\", a collection of 115 volumes 1). But since the best insight into the doctrinal part was to be obtained in the Universities, where lamas not only from Central Tibet, but from Ladakh, Tartary and China thronged the lecture-halls, Desideri moved in August to the University of Sera at two miles' distance from Lhasa. Here he was comfortably housed and could say mass in his private oratory; he had the free use of the libraries and could converse with the most learned among the professors 2). His plan was to write in the Tibetan language a refutation of the errors of their doctrine and a defence of the Catholic religion. But he had hardly set to work when it was interrupted by a vio-lent catastrophe. The Tartars invaded the country, Lhasa was taken and sacked, and December 3 the king and his ministers were murdered. Not thinking himself safe at Sera Desideri retired to the province of Takp6-Khier at eight days' journey from the cap-ital, where he found time and opportunity to finish his book. His retirement lasted till A pril1721 with the exception of a few months from foreign merchants, but added from his own store due Pietre di Belsoar di Goa, un Cocco di Balsamo del Brasile e un vasetto di Balsamo apopletico, with directions for their use written by himself in Tibetan. 1) \"The Kang-gyur, or properly the Kah-guyr, the great code or \"the Translated Commandment\" is so called on account of its text having been translated from the ancient India language and in a few cases from the Chinese\" .... \"The code extends to one hundred and eight volumes of about one thousand pages each, comprising one thousand and eighty-three distinct works.\" For these and other details cf.

In one of his visits to the capital he gave his book to read to his former teacher of Tibetan, one of the cleverest among the lamas. It consisted he tells us of three volumes. The first ar-gued against the migration of souls as taught by Buddhism, the second attacked the main error into which the Tongba-gni falls, the denial of an Absolute Being (Ens a se), Creator of the world, Itself uncreated. The third volume was constructive and in the form of a dialogue gave an exposition of the Christian doctrine. The work caused a great stir and \"my house suddenly became the scene of incessant comings and goings by all sorts of people, but chiefly learned men and professors, who came from the mon-asteries and universities, especially from those of Sera and Bree-bung, the principal ones, to apply for permission to see and read the book\" 1). While he was still staying at the hamlet of Trong-g-nee in the province of Takpo-Khier, he received orders from Rome to leave Tibet. 2). At the request of the Capuchin Father Guiseppe da Morro he translated into Italian the book Lam-rim-ccea, which is a kind of digest of the two great works Kaa-n-ghiur and Tongba-gni; this translation was to assist da Morro in his study of the Buddhist doctrine.

Speaking of the boundaries of Tibet Desideri remarks as fol-lows: \"Looking from west to east, that is from Treescy-Khang and Cartoa to Seiling [Hsining], the most western extremity of the Great Chinese Wall, this country is so vast that six and a half months of uninterrupted travel are needed to cover the distance between the two extreme points. From north to south the extent varies greatly. Between Cartoa and the beginning of the province of Zzang-to, that is, a distance which it would take two and a half months to travel over, the country extends far to the northward and only slightly to the south: for in the north it has as its frontier the rugged and inaccessible rocks that reach as far as Y arkand. In the south the country touches the kingdom of Collahor and other countries situated at the same latitude as Sirenagar. \"From the beginning of the Zzang-to province to Lhasa, one month's travel, the country extends much further soutwards, much less northward. From the province ofChiee-rong it borders on the dominions ofthe king of Patan, the second prince of Nepal, and near N esti, where the realm of the king of Kattmandu-the highest of the three Nepalese princes - begins, the frontier descends to 28° N. The city of Lhasa lies at about 30° N. Taken at that point the country does not extend far northward. But to the south the provinces of Man, Pari en Bree-me-giong 1) border on Altipari, PoraniaandNegricot,allsubje\"'t to the Great Mogul and situated at the other side of the Ganges. From Lhasa to Seiling, that is to China and Lower Tartary in the direction of Coconor, a distance of three months, the country extends far northward, for it reaches as far as Seiling, which is situated at 36° 26' N. And to the south, where the provinces of Lho-ro, Zze-ri, Cong-t6 and Cong-me have as their neighbours certain tribes called Lhoba, that is 'Southern Peoples', the territory of Tibet descends to the 25th degree\" 2). From these latitudes it is also apparent, says Desideri, that the intense cold of Tibet is not due to its northern geographical position 1) Desideri includes Bree-me-giongor Sikkim among the Tibetan provinces. It prob-ably means that just now Tibetan influence was paramount at Sikkim, which had recently been liberated by Tibetan arms from the domination of the Bhutanese. (Cf. White p, 16).

From October to the middle of April or the beginning of May the cold is most intense, then the weather grows milder, and in June, July and August, but for the cooling effect of the rains, the heat would be quite unbearable intensified as it is by the reflection from the naked mountain sides. Thus vegetation is rendered possible. September is a dry season and up to the middle of October the tem-perature remains moderate. Because the air is dry, the cold, how-ever intense, does not affect one's health, and I never took any harm from sleeping in the open as I often had to do on my jour-neys 1). The numerous scientific observations that have been taken of late years have greatly enlarged our knowledge of the climatic conditions of this highest table-land on earth 2). In consequence, the views generally prevalent concerning the utterly arid nature of the Tibetan climate have had to be thoroughly revised. Desi-deri's observations have special reference to the Tsangpo district, with which he had been in touch. On this territory Sandberg remarks: \"In Central districts rain-showers occur on very many days in July and August, the monsoon effects not reaching the North-western Central region until about July 20th. From the middle of June to the end of August, in the provinces of Tsang and Ui, including Yarlung, Y amdok and Lhobrak, nearly every day the sky is cloudy and frequently heavily overcast\" 3). From the British expedition staying at Gyantse and Lhasa in 1904 we have some maximum temperatures for the summer-months of that year. These statistics work out for Gyantse (13,200 feet) from June 26 to July 14 at an average maximum of 95° F (35°C.)with a highest maximum of 10~° F.

With reference to Desideri's remark regarding the summer-rains it may be noted that at Gyantse rain was recorded on 6 days 1) Desideri, MS. A. Book II, ch. II p. 6-7; Puini, p. 38-39. 0} Cf.

The produce of the soil is but scanty in this rocky, cold and barren country, where moreover no water can be had for irrigation except at the foot of hills and mountains. Barley is an important crop as is also rice in the southern districts; the most important, however, are root-crops, especially turnips, radish, garlic and on-ions. Fruit also is scarce. Walnuts and peaches are met with in every district, pears only in Thakp6-Khier and in Kham, where even the vine manages to keep alive 2). The presence of gold and silver all over Tibet, especially in Kham, one of the points brought out by Desideri, has been amply confirmed by later travellers. Thus Nain Singh speaks of a rich silver-bearing hill-district four miles north of Lhasa. But the government prohibits any mining operations because the country would be impoverished and the population degenerate, should the metal be worked 3). A different policy is followed with regard to the gold-fields of Thok J alung about I 00 miles north of the Kailas Peak. There under the supervision of a special gold-commissioner appointed by the government at Lhasa, the gold-bearing soil is dug up and washed 4). To this effect, Desideri informs us, they use a wooden structure, something like a gun-carriage or the con-duit of a water-mill. On the bottom of this machine large square sods covered with thick coarse grass are placed and on these the dug-up earth is spread out. From the top large quantities of water are poured in, which rushing down with force carry away the lighter earth and small stones, leaving a black substance with the heavier gold between the blades of grass. After this the sods are taken out of the tray and again washed and shaken over bowls, which operation is repeated till the pure gold of the size of coarse sand remains behind 6). 1) Cf.

It is used in making tea, in order to change its natural colour into that of red wine by which they set great store. It also takes the place of soap and is used to clean articles of clothing 1). Sherring has a different account to give of the red colour and the stimulating effect of the Tibetan brick-tea. That it was the result of an admixture he says was well known, but the secret was very carefully kept by the Chinese manufacturers. \"It was accidentally discovered by one Kumaon firm, the Berenag Tea Company, as a cake of Chinese brick-tea opened by them was found to have a leaf of the herb utilised left in it by an oversight. This leaf was carefully examined and was traced to be a wild plant which grows very generally in many localities in our hills, and as soon as experiments produced the red colour and the stimulating effect in the beverage it was known for certain that the whole secret was discovered\" 2). Desideri does not fail to notice the thermal springs of sulphur-ous water and the use made of their healing power by sick people, though he does not specify, as Sandberg does, that one of the main purposes of those baths is \"the efficacy of the sulphur in the destruction of vermin,\" by which all Tibetans are plagued on account of their loathsome dirtiness 3). Among the curiosities of Tibet Desideri mentions a curious kind of springs. \"In some localities there are other mineral waters of somewhat acid taste and of a peculiar quality which I would not have believed possible if I had not experienced it. The springs do not work all the year round nor have they that peculiar quality except at a fixed season. Towards the end of the severest cold, that is about the end of March, when the peaches begin to bloom, the springs suddenly begin to flow. The water has the taste of peach blossom, and as long as the blossom continues on the trees, so long does the water retain this taste, and during the same period it has the wonderful property of purging the stomach, 1) Desideri, MS. A. Book II, ch. II, p. 9. Puini, p. 98.

About the end of April the blos-soming season is over and with it the working ofthe springs, and if in some case the latter do continue to flow they have lost their pungent taste and purgative property\" 1). Are we to take this merely as a reference to the thawing of the springs at the begin-ning of the mild season? or must we here recognize geysers with their intermittent character, which are frequent in some parts of Tibet 2} ? But even then, what about the wonderful taste and the curative properties of these waters? Turning to the animal kingdom Desideri now describes the Tibetan fauna, the musk deer, the parrots of Takpo and Congb6, and especially the yak, after which a chapter is given to rivers, boats and bridges 3). The reader who, should expect a minute description of the Tsangpo, would be disappointed; there are a few general remarks on it but the name is pot mentioned. \"The moun-tainous nature of the country has allowed the formation of only one large river besides inconsiderable mountain streams; flowing from east to west [sic] this river divides the whole of this third and principal Tibet into a northern and southern territory. Then after traversing the whole province of Lower Congb6 it turns east and south, enters the country of the Lhobas and thence descends into Rongmati, a province of Mogol, finally to reach and join the Gan-ges.\" This is all. On the other hand there are the ~oats of yak or cow hides and the hanging bridges, which engage a great deal more of his attention. Thus all the bridges span the river without any support, except the iron bridge east of Zze-thang, where the river is so wide that it requires three spans resting on two stone piers built in the stream 4). \"From sheer necessity I have twjce made use of such a bridge, in all other cases I have been able to avoid them\", which concluding remark seems to show that Desideri did not consider these bridges the safest mode of transit. 1) Desideri, MS.

Pundit Kishen Singh, who was at Tsetang Octo-ber 8, 1882, crossed the river three miles below the town, where it was 299 paces wide. \"There was formerly an iron bridge at this place which I was told was destroyed by lightning\".

He starts with Serkia, the capital of the province of Zzangto, where the Tartar princess in whose escort he had travelled, had been taken ill. The enforced leisure had allowed him to look about him. \"Serkia is built in the form of a crescent on the side of a high mountain, whose slope it covers till a large and populous monastery is reached. Right at the top lies a fort. Down below flows a river across which a fine bridge has been thrown, not of iron, but of brick and wood. Many houses and villages are seen scattered about the surrounding plain. In the town itself reside a governor and many officials\" 1). Serkia can I think only be identified with the Saka Dzong or Saka Fort of modern maps. (Sometimes Sar_ka, cf. Stieler 1901 ). It is situated at about 85° E and 29° 30' N, a mile or so north of the Chaka River, a tributary of the Charta, which joins the Tsang-po some ten miles to the west. The place is described by Rawling as \"a straggling village of about twenty-five mud brick houses built under the shelter of a low ridge and on a mound lying just above the level of the plain.\" Not a town, therefore, in any real sense, nor is any mention made of a gompa or of a fort. Yet it is a place of considerable importance not so much from its size as from the fact that it is regarded as the centre of a very large district 2). Nain Singh, who was there in September 1865 and in May 1866, calls it \"a large village containing numerous houses built of sun-dried bricks. It is ruled by a J ongpon\" 3). A fort standing at the east end of the village is also mentioned by him but no monastery. Very likely the place has fallen into decay in the course of time. Perhaps we may see a relic of former greatness in the fact that the whole district from Tra-dom to Sang-Sang-Kau, a distance of about 160 miles in a straight line, is under the jurisdiction.of the ] ongpon or governor of Saka. \"The two other provinces of the most western part of this Tibet\", Desideri continues, \"are those of Chiee-rong and Kutti, both of which border on Nepal.

Not long ago the town and country of Kutti were subject to the Ragia of Kattmandu, but for several years it has formed part of this Thibet. If there is but one governor in other important places of this kingdom, here at Kutti there are three, forming one governing body or law-court. The reason is that the king wants to make sure of their fidelity, not only because it is a frontier town where many strangers come and go, but more espec-ially because every year this region furnishes considerable sums to the treasury. For in the first place these parts supply the whole of Tibet with iron. Then because the above-mentioned desert [Ngari Giongar] renders travelling very irksome, there are always passing through Kutti caravans of Armenian merchants, and traders from Hindustan, Caximir and Nepal. The merchandise arrives in uni-form and well-closed packages, each bale weighing two Man di Pattna, which if I remember right is about eighty pounds. Those packages called in Hindustani Baccu, in Tibetan Thobo, are not opened or examined as to their contents, but for each two Man di Pattna several Trang are paid. Each Trang is 13!

Large quantities of the root are gathered from July to October, and afterbeingdried in the shade they are ready for export').

Across the large river that flows by the city, a long and strong bridge is built, one of the best of the whole of Tibet. The plain round about is studded with farmsteads and villages\" 1). Gyantse or Chiang-ze (13,120 feet) situated on the Nyang River an affluent of the Tsangpo was visited by Nain Singh in 1865 and by others after him, and has been well-known since Sir Francis Younghusband's expedition, a party of which had to sustain a regular siege at this place. A full description of the flourishing, large town is given by Waddell, who like the Pundit before him makes special mention of the woollen cloth referred to by Desideri, for which the town has remained famous till the present day 2). Far less known is Secchia or Sa-kya, which for ages has been the headquarters of the semi-heretical Sa-kya school of Buddhists, who were paramount in Tibet till their power was broken by the Gelugpa-sect 3). Della Penna dates the independent position of its Great Lama from the year 790, when the Chinese Emperor created this dignity 4). The town lies at an altitude of 13,900 feet on the right bank of Sa-kya Chu about at 88° 1 0' E and 28° 55' N. When staying there in 1871 Hari Ram learned that the great monastery at the foot of which the town is situated, counted 2,500 inmates ruled by a Great Lama called Sa-kya Gangma. His are the only lamas in this part of Tibet who are allowed to marry. Sarat Chandra Das discusses several points in the history of the Sa-kya principality. A few months before his visit in 1882 the Prince-Lama had died leaving five sons out of whom a successor was to be chosen 5). Ekai Kawaguchi felt so disgusted at the 1) Desideri, MS. A. Book II, ch.

There is no need to dwell on Giegazze or Shigatse (12,850 feet) on the Nyang River not farfrom the Tsangpo, where in thefamous monastery Tashi-Lhumpo the Pantchen Riponche or Tashi Lama resides. The particulars given by Desideri and many more have become generally known especially after Sven Hedin's inquiries during his seven weeks' stay there 3). Desideri was now at the heart of Tibet, Lhasa, the mystic city, which was to remain shrouded from the eager West for nearly two centuries more. When in 1866 with the most diligent search Yule had gathered together whatever evidence was available, the poor-ness of the result drew from him the complaint referred to at the beginning of this chapter: \"A fatality has attended the accounts of Lhasa that should have been\".

In the palaces of the great the hated foreigner made his home for weeks, in the splendid apartments of the wonderful Potala he deliberated upon the fate of Tibet, even within the precincts of the Jo-kang he set his foot when the doors of the sacred treasure-house and Kaaba of all Lamaism were thrown wide. Lhasa had yielded up its secrets, and the reader who may wish to wander in imagination among the monuments of its past, need but turn to the splendid volumes by Austen Waddell and Percival Landon. Nearly two centuries before, Desideri wandered in those same streets, a lonely traveller. What he noted down of the sights he saw was never known to Yule, nor is it mentioned by either of the two writers just referred to. Desideri's account does, indeed, lack finish and detail, it is silent on points of importance, it wants the indispensable aid of drawing and photography, yet its historic-1) Kawaguchi, p. 241-245.

Two principal personages are always mentioned by Desideri, the Great-Lama and the King. The dignity that goes by the latter title was created by Kushi Khan, who in 1642 conquered Tibet. Retaining the sovereignty himself, he appointed by the side of the Dalai Lama, a Desi or Governor. The Desi is commonly called regent (gyal-tsab) or king (gyalbo), and the extent of his power and influence is at any time greatly dependent on the personal character of the Dalai Lama. At present the office is elective, though the candidate must be a lama from one of the four great Lings, the royal monasteries of Lhasa 2). Without venturing on any estimate of the population Desideri only notes that it is very numerous and contains among its num-bers a large proportion of foreign merchants, which is still true of the modern city 3). The ho1,1ses are described as built mainly of stone, three stories high and having large and comfortable apart-ments and rooms with floors made of a kind of mosaic gleaming like mirrors. There is, moreover, a domestic oratory with lamps burning before the images of the gods, whilst offerings of water, rice, corn and fruit are displayed in dishes of porcelain or other material. Evidently only the dwellings of the well-to-do can have answered this description and even these cannot, at the present time, be said to come up to this standard. Speaking of modern Lhasa Waddell says that \"the houses of the citizens are substan-tially built of stone or sun-baked bricks; the walls neatly white-washed and the woodwork picked out in colours, with charms against the Evil Eye pasted over the doorway, give a general look of comfort from the street. But a glance within dispels the illusion and shows the interior to be quite as squalid and dirty as those of the wretched hovels in the country, and reflects the general poverty of the place. The more well-to-dO' also live in a curious mix-ture of squalor and dirt. Their larger houses have similar mean and untidy interiors, although some of the more wealthy, imitat-ing the Chinese have sufficient taste to ornament their interiors 1) Desideri, MS. A.

Desideri refers neither to dirty interiors nor to wretched dwellings of the poorer classes, though we may fairly suppose them to have been no better than they are now. The condition of the streets he has also passed over in silence, though every modern visitor has pro-nounced them to be unutterably wretched, being unpaved and con-verted into regular mud pools, or rather cesspools in the rainy season, since they also serve the purpose of sewers. But then, the European notion and practice of cleanliness and comfort had not reached the level which we now consider normal, andinDesideri's opinion this feature did not call for special mention 2). In the centre of the city, we are further told, is a fairly large square, in which market is held every day till the evening. Its nothern side is occupied by the luxurious Trussi-Khang palace, the residence of the king. \"On the west-side of this square stands an ancient and very rich temple, called Lha-Brang, palace of the Lha. In the porch are fine pictures. Within there are many recesses, like chapels, which are dedicated to the several gods of those peoples and in which many large lamps, fed with yellow butter instead of oil, burn night and day. Like the other temples of Tibet it is covered with a flat roof. From this roof rise a number of pillars arranged along a large, oblong opening, and supporting a canopy made of bronze or brass plates ornamented with bas-reliefs, the whole being beautifully guilt. The sun shining on it makes it luminously resplendent and proclaims afar the majesty of the temple. Small bells which tinkle at the slightest breath of air are hung up at the edges especially near the corners. This superstruc-ture is not quite flat but rises towards the middle like a roof the sides being covered with figures and arabesques of guilt metal. Through the screen light has access to the temple.

No one, not even the king, may pass through this street on horseback; every one must dismount and lead his horse by the bridle or leave it at the entrance. Some even traverse the street measuring the whole length of it with their bodies.\" Waddell has only a passing reference to the \"chief market-place in the great square surrounding the Cathedral\" 1), by which, of course, the wide street of the Khora is meant, as also appears from the plans of Lhasa given by Waddell and by Landon, though these plans do not agree in every detail. The Pundit Kishen Singh, who stayed at Lhasa for some months in 1879, is the only one to mention that the temple and its three adjacent buildings-the court:..house,. the police-station and the treasury-are surrounded by a street thirty feet broad; he, too, is the only one when speaking of the sacred roads to include the circuit round the temple 2). When describing the temple Waddell does indeed refer to a sacred road round it, the so-called Middle Circle \"an alley by which pilgrims circumambulate the main build-ing\" 3), but this cannot be the \"wide street\". Has the sacred rite of walking round the temple fallen into disuse? It is certainly strange that, whereas every visitor reports on the Lingkor, the principal circular road, the via sacra of Lhasa, that girdles the town, Desideri seems to be unaware of its existence. The great temple Lha-brang, the house of the gods, -the name of the city has the same meaning and was originally the dis-tinctive name of the temple -commonly called Jo-kang, was of course an object of interest during the English occupation. The descriptions by Waddell and Landon are fa~; more complete than Desideri's, for they could procure admission to the innermost parts, even to the great golden statue of the principal god Jo, which is meant to represent Buddha as a young man 4).

Nor does it resemble any Indian ones, nor have I seen anything so uncouth in Buddha's images in Burma, Ceylon or Japan.\" Equally incompatible are the descriptions by these two writers of the Doring, the ancient monument before the main entrance of the temple 1). Whether the outward appearance of the temple has been much tampered with since Desideri's time it is hard to say. He clearly mentions but one canopy, Giorgi refers to five 2) and Kishen Singh to four, while Waddell counts \"three so-called golden pavilions of Chinese pagoda shape\". Tinkling bells are not referred to by any later travellers. \"There are at Lhasa\", the narrator continues, \"three other idolatrous temples and monasteries of the same sect [the Gelugpa or Yellow-caps]. One is situated in the north-eastern quarter and is reserved for the Tartars. The other two lie towards the east, one near the town-limit, the other just on it, both called by the same name Ramo-cce. In the former there live many monks, mostly children, who start their first studies here, later to pass into the university-monastery to take their degrees. The second is dedi-cated to Sciacchia-Thubba [the Tibetan appellation of Buddha Sakya Muni], whom the Tibetans acknowledge as their founder. The legendary tales current about him can be read in the rich paintings of a large monastery near the temple. It is especially the Nepalese merchants, with whom the god is held in great honour, who come here to perform their devotions; therefore the above-mentioned Nepalese princess on becoming queen of Tibet, had it constructed for their convenience\" 8). Supposing the site of Desideri's \"Tartar\" monastery to be cor-rectly given, it must be identified with the establishment visited 1) Cf. Waddell, Lhasa, p. 341. Landon, II, 292 ff. and the photos.

As to Ramo-cce, which lies to the northward, the site assigned to it by Desideri is quite wrong, while in no modern writer any hint can be found of there being two distinct establishments of the same name. Opposite the Ra-mo-cce temple Waddell in his Plan of Lhasa marks an \"Upper School of Mysticism\", which is probably Desideri's scholastic estab-lishment. Temple and school would make one monastery, which is also the appellation applied to Ramo-cce by Nain Singh 2) and Kinthup 3). The temple itself, after the J o-kang the most venerated of all temples in Tibet, impressed Landon as \"a mediaeval build-ing of an undistinguished type, the guilded roof is the prettiest thing about it\" 4).

Situated in a plain the town is enclosed by mountains so as to leave only four approaches each of them defended by a fortification. Through the middle of the plain, close by the town, a large river flows from west to east. Coming from Giegazze one meets, on approaching the plain between two huge mountains, a fort situated at a great height. Fail-ing other means, stones would suffice to stop a whole army. Not far from it there is a vast university-monastery, called Breebung, inhabited by many lamas, doctors and professors and some thou-sands of undergraduate monks.

Then, entering the town, one approaches the famous Potala, a splendid sight, the magnificent residence of the Great Lama of Tibet 1). The situation of Lhasa in its fairly level plain (II ,831 feet above sea-level) surrounded by mountains has been known for some time from the explorations of the Pundits. Barring the slip which makes the river Kyi flow from west to east, instead of the opposite direction, Desideri's account agrees on all points with Waddell's journal. When the British expedition had crossed the Tsangpo by the iron suspension-bridge of Chaksam, the Kyi valley lay open before them. But the entrance \"narrowed into a strong trail along which we had to pass in single file over masses of rocks fallen from above, threading in and out amongst giant rusty boulders and climbing giddy staircases hewn across the face of the granite cliffs overhanging the rushing swirling tide of the muddy Tsangpo, a few yards below .... This defile was nearly two miles long, and about the most formidable natural barrier we had yet encoun-tered. The strongest part of all was at its lower end, where it joined at right angles the valley leading up to Lhasa. Here the rocks rose up in almost sheer cliffs into colossal columns and aiguilles, owing to the massive cristalline granite splitting sharply along its lines of cleavage, and on the topmost pinnacle, nearly haH a thousand feet above us, outlined against the sky, stood looking down upon us the old castle of Chu'sul and its lower fori: on a knife-edge ridge much nearer. These two forts, although now more or less ruinous, had evidently been of enormous strength, .... this marvellously strong natural position. . . . luckily was not held against us, al-though an immense heap of newly coliected stones at its lower end showed that the Lamas had intended to hold it'' 2). The aptness of the quotation will, it is hoped, atone for its length since it would hardly be possible to afford. a more vivid illustration of Desideri's somewhat jejune statement concerning the natural strength of the approach to the Lhasa valley.

Waddell still found much to admire, whilst Landon declares \"that cheap and tawdry are the only possible adjectives which can be applied to the interior decoration of this great palace-temple.

Besides the northern road by Sera, Desideri resumes, two others issue eastward from the Lhasa valley both protected by fortifica-tions. One traverses a very high mountain and leads to Sa-m-yee, the other, more to the east, narrows down between two mountains on one of which the monastery-university of Kaa-n-den is situ-ated. The head-lama ranks so high, that when the Great Lama is absent, he may supply his place on solemn occasions. If now you take the road that skirts the mountain on which Kaa-n-den stands and then turning to the left strike for the north, you come upon a province, still uncivilized, called Hor, the inhabitants of which, mostly farmers and herdsmen, call themselves Ciangba or Horba. From this region one enters the eastern desert,,in the direction of China, called by geographers Lopo. If, turning to the right, the southern route is taken, one is led to the province of Taze and other provinces situated on the northern bank of the large river that traverses the whole of this Tibet and divides it into a northern and southern half 2). In Kaa-n-den or Ga-den 8) we meet with the third large monas-tery-town and university of the Tibetan Yellow-caps. It is situated close to the Kyi River twenty-five miles from Lhasa and was founded by Tsongkapa 4), who is interred there. When visited by Nain Singh in 1866 its inmates numbered 3,300. Its head, accord-ing to Waddell, exercises spiritual authority over the three great state-monasteries and over the whole of the Yellow-cap order 6).

From all parts the Tibetans flock to this temple to celebrate the memory of a certain Urghien, the founder and propagator of their religion, of whom I shall speak later on. The locality is frightful, for on the north and west it is hemmed in by high mountains and to the east and south stretches a sandy plain, in which very cold winds are prevalent 1). After Nain Singh in 1874 Sarat Chandra Das stayed a few days at Samaye 2). The town is situated, he says, 35 miles south-east of Lhasa, cut off from the northern bank of the Tsangpo by a sandy belt of over two miles. These shifting sands constitute a real menace and a large portion of the town including some of the temples has already been buried under them. The principal temple is that of \\Vu-tse; this, however, is not the ancient edifice referred to by our missionary, which together with the library was destroyed by fire in the early years of the nineteenth century. Urghien or Padmasambhava we have had occasion to speak of in connection with the Kailas Peak. He is worshipped in a temple erected outside Samaye over the cave which at one time was his dwelling-place. Precisely on account of its sacred character the large monastery now serves the purpose of state-treasury, to which circumstance Desideri does not allude. \"At a day's journey eastward of Samaye across the river, on its southern bank therefore, lies the town of Zze-thang, the capital of the province of the same name. It is the residence of several governors and officials, some Tartar, some Tibetan. The town is known for its manufacture of woollen stuffs, especially serge, which is made so fine as to look like silk. There is also a large monastery with a teinple, while the trade causes many merchants to settle in the town. To the west the province of Zze-thang touches on that of Yarlung, known for its large pieces of fine rockcrystal.

The town of Tsetang is placed by Nain Singh, who was there in 1874, about twenty miles east of Samaye on the right bank of the Yar-lung Chu, a considerable southern affluent of the Tsangpo 1). The explorer Lala was struck by the open-air market where all sorts of goods from Calcutta, China, Kashmir and Nepal. were sold 2). No visitors report on Tsetang as specializing in serges, though Tsy-bikoff notes, that it is famous \"for the production of cloths, knit-ting and the yellow monk hats\" 3). While N ain Singh speaks of two monasteries, Lala and Kishen Singh mention only of one with about 700 inhabitants 4). Since N ain Singh seems to make a point of mentioning all the gompas or monasteries that lie along his route, his report seems the more reliable. As to Desideri's province of Yarlung, or geographically the Yarlung valley, Nain Singh, the Lama Ugyen Gyatso and Chandra Das are one in extolling it as one of the most fertile and populous regions of Tibet 5). Wheat and barley are abundant as well as peas and many other kinds of vegetables. Fruit-trees, especially apricots and pears, are very common. Das specially notes west of Yarlung the \"Shetag Mountains, or Black Crystal, thus called from the glistening black rocks exposed to view along the road\", Desideri's rock-crystal. Even with the additional data of Desideri, we can throw no light on the more eastern province of Y ee. No Indian explorer supplies information. Beyond mere mention of \"a wealthy district\" east of Tsetang by the Lama U gyen Gyatso there is nothing in his report, nor is there in Lala's or Nero Singh's. Gold in this region is referred to only by Kinthup, who records two mines near Lhagyaro, about twenty-five miles ESE of Tsetang and two more near Laringbu 8). \"South of the province of Zze-thang and Yarlung\", the survey continues, \"lie the two districts of Mon and Pari.

This southern border-tract of Tibet, enclosed between Pari in the Upper Chumbi-valley in the west and Mon-Yul in the east, called for some discussion apropos of Cacella and Cabral's jour-ney 2). The exact frontier between Tibet and Bhutan in Desideri's time cannot now be determined, it certainly did not coincide with the present boundary line, for no district in Southern Tibet grows rice, not even the fertile Lhobrak country, as Ugyen Gyatso ex-pressly notes 3), and all the supplies are imported from Sikkim, Bhutan and Assam. The same holds for the other products men-tioned by Desideri, as far as the reports of the Indian explorers on the subject allow us to judge. Thus at Tsona Dzong, some thirty miles north of Tawang in Mon-Yul, Nain Singh came on an important market, in which Tibetan articles were exchanged for rice, spices, dyes, fruits, and coarse cloths (a kind of silk) from Assam. Rice is even a state monopoly and at Tsona is a De-Rang or rice house in charge of a Lhasa official who buys up all the imports 4). Something of the kind is reported by Rinziri Nimgyl for Chhampa village in the Punthang valley in East Bhutan. There the exports from Tibet, especially salt and wool, were either sold for cash, in Tibetan currency, or bartered for bure (a kind of silk), kha-mar (coloured silk), yultha (a cotton cloth), rice etc. The same tra-veller briefly notices a plant from which a scarlet dye is obtained. South of Chumbi in Bhutan he found \"a scandent plant, called chud .... It is found growing wild in these parts entwined round the trunk of trees and it is a most important article of trade. The people gather it in the jungles, cut it up into small pieces and carry it away into Tibet, where a rich red dye is extracted from it, when dry. This dye is in great demand throughout Tibet\" 5). 1) Desideri, MS. A. Book II, ch. VII. p. 34; Puini, p. 70-71. 1) Supra Ch. V, p. 143. 1) Reeords, II, 345.

This territory is divided into several provinces, the principal is Takp6-Cignl with the large town of Cignl as its capital; then there are Takp6-to, Takp6-ru, Takp6-tru-lung and Takp6-Khier, each ad-ministrated by their own governor. All these have abundant sup-plies of fruit and wood. On the mountains grow the Reopontico, the Assenzio Pontico, the M elilotus and the Spigonardo in great plenty, besides the juniper and the pine-tree, which yields an excellent gum. There are more and better fields, hence the wealth of a household consists in its stock of cattle and yaks, while large quantities of excellent butter are the staple article of export of those parts. \"Takp6 produces the best kind of writing-paper, which is used throughout Tibet and is exported to Nepal. It is made of the inner bark of shrubs. In Takp6-Khier also, the wine needed to celebrate Mass is manufactured, but it must be boiled to keep, in which process one third of it is \"lost. The Tibetans do not understand the art of making wine, nor do they drink it, their only beverage is Ceiang a kind of beer. \"There are two places of special importance in the Takp6 dis-tricts. One is a rugged, high mountain with a plateau about half way up. On it stands a splendid temple, which is held in such high veneration by the people, that both men and women come to live as hermits up and down the mountain-side, some in monasteries, others in hermitages. Two palaces are the residences of two lamas, one of whom belongs to the class which is permitted to marry to secure the succession, whilst the other h'ls to remain single and will be succeeded by a re-incarnate lama. The top of the mountain consists of many clefts and crags on one of which stands a building which serves as a retreat to the lama and is connected with the other crags by long wooden bridges. Many come to this place to present their offerings and many make arrangements for their bodies to be carried hither to be devoured by the ravens and eagles. \"The other place of importance and also greatly venerated is a wide tract of very high and wild mountains, which form as it were a kind of stairs.

It has been traversed by only two Pundits: by Nem Singh in 1878-79 and by Kinthup in 1880-1884, neither of whom was a trained explorer while both worked under difficult circumstances. Hence Kinthup's information can only be treated as a bona fide story of his travels 2). From the reports of both Takp6 has good soil and rich pastures with thick woods in the higher parts, but there is nothing about a division into provinces, of which Desideri puts the number at five and Della Penna at seven 3). A wild grape is only reported for the more eastern Congb6, yet its presence, confirmed by DellaPenna'), was a reason for the Capuchin missionaries to establish their station of Trong-g-nee in Takp6-Khier 5). Desideri is very vague in locating the two sacred spots, but, his mention of the lama who is not bound to celibacy affords some clue. For in MS. B. when speaking of the lamas who are free to marry he mentions three such: those of Secchia, Takp6 and Lun-gar 6). Now Nem Singh mentions 88 miles from Tsetang \"the large and fine fort of Gyatsa Dzong and the Takp6 monastery\" 7) without any further details. Some help towards the identification of the second spot is given by the name <;e-ri. D' An ville's Map of Tibet has, in the district of Tac-pou-y, a place called Dsiri south 1) Desideri, MS. A.

It does not show in Burrard's map of 1914, perhaps on account of its uncertain position. Nem Singh narrates that at \"125 miles from Tsetang [he] crossed the Tsari Chu which comes straight from Tsari only two days off to the south. It is said to be not a large town, but there are many villages in its vicinity and plenty of bamboos and woods. One and a half day to the south of Tsari is a country of wild tribes: the district is called Gimuchen, literally the \"naked men country\". There is a rise of five miles on to the ridge called the Hongbo Nga La, which forms the western boundary of the Kongbo district\" 1). No temple or pilgrimage is mentioned here. Kawaguchi referring to Tsari as \"a peak in the Himalayas in the south-east which forms the frontier of Assam\" calls it a place of pilgrimage and the second sacred place in Tibet, but he furnishes no further details 2). Sandberg has this: \"In Takp6 is the famous place of pilgrimage named Tsari T'ugka, and nearly forty miles SE of this Tsari is the great snowy peak of Pal Tsari, which is the ultima Thule of Tibetan pelgrimage, involving a fortnight of hard travel from the banks of the Yeru Tsangpo. Tsari peak is said to be covered with thick pine forests at its base. The chief risk of journeys in Takp6 and Tsari arises from the savage tribes dwelling across the ranges in the south of these districts,who appear occasion-ally to make raids on pilgrim bands\" 3). As regards the curious restriction that at the second sacred spot women are prohibited under pain of death fromcrossingacertain limit, may it net be connected with a legend heard by Kinthup on his way to Tsari? Near Mipa he traversed a high pass (15,960 feet) from which all women were warned away under heavy penalties on account of an offence once committed by a woman against the goddess Drolma. From this same goddess is was said to have been called the Drolma pass 4}. 1) Records, I, 210-211; discussing Nem Singh's data Lieut.

On the south it borders on the so-called Lhoba-peoples, with whom trade is carried on, but very cautiously, as they are exceedingly wild tribes. \"Setting out eastward from Takp6, one first passes through the small province of Nang, which terminates in an enormously high mountain very rich in woods; then one enters the Congb6-coun-try. It is divided by the river into Cong-t6 and Cong-me, or upper and lower Congb6, each of which is again divided into provinces. The climate is less rigorous, but the soil is less fertile because too sandy. Yet these territories are better populated and richer because the infertility has made the people apply themselves to trade. Pine-trees a:nd cypresses are of frequent occurrence in Congb6 as well as other sorts of large vegetation, which render so pleasant the mountain slopes and the banks of the' river which traverses all this part of Tibet and divides Congb6 into an upper and a lower part. To the south of Congb6live the Lhoba or southern peoples. \"The Lhobas are savage tribes. They mostly live in woods and in wretched cabins, and their only occupation is hunting all sorts of game, the flesh of which is eaten raw or ill-roasted. They some-times feed on human flesh and do not scruple to kill a man when he appears to be healthy and plump. They always go armed with bow and arrow and are excellent archers. One very barbarous custom obtains among them: when a man sees one of his kinsman or a beloved friend at the point of death he consoles him in his extremity with the promise that he shall not leave this world alone, but he wjll give him so and so many companions, saying a definite number. If the man dies, he kills the number stated, and as an authentic proof of the faithful discharge of his promise he wears a collar of as many teeth as he has killed men. \"These peoples do not allow any one to pass through their coun-try, whosoever the stranger may be, and for this purpose they watch the roads and keep them in an impracticable state.

Kinthup describes Nang Dzong as a building with fortified walls whence all the roads to Congb6 branch off. No one can go to Congb6 without passing this Dzong, to which a monastery is attached 3). On the Congb6 territory we are very ill-informed. Nem Singh, who traversed it, only notes a low stone wall near the Kyimdong River to mark the boundary between Upper and Lower Congb6 4), while Kinthup's wanderings along both banks of the Tsangpo only prompt him to some general remarks on the fertility of the soil and the abundance of live stock and of wood. One feature ·waddell learned from him was that peaches and apricots are so plentiful that pigs are fed on them 5). Nor is our information about the Lhoba tribes much more satisfactory. The name here used for the southern neighbours of Congb6 is of much wider application and may include all the tribes living in this southern part and even Bhutan itself. For Schlagintweit notes that the people of this country call themselves Lhopas6), and even before him Koros takes Lhopato and Bhutan to be synonymous. White has not this name, but he divides the Bhutanese people in two parts, the boundary line being the Pele-La, about halfway between Punakha and Tongsa. The eastern group he says is not of Tibetan descent nor do they speak Tibetan 7). The first to get into more intimate touch with these tribes was Nain Singh in 1874.

It owes a great deal to its trade-route from Darchendo or Ta Chien Lu to Lhasa, the main line of the tea-traffic, the indispensable daily drink of the Tibetans. Desideri's long stay naturally furnished him with a large amount of information on the people.-As a rule strangers meet with a kind welcome in Tibet and thus Desideri was well treated everywhere, while his permission to have a house of his own argues exceptional kindness. Only Mohammedans did not share in this generous hospitality. Thus whereas in the second Tibet they were allowed their own mosques and burial-grounds, in the third Tibet they were forbidden to have them, and they had to give up the cemetery which they anciently had at Lhasa and to transfer it to the interior, to some waste tract of country. This aversion is at least partly based on religious grounds as appears from the nickname Mutekba, 'unbelievers' 2). The caste-system is unknown and mutual intercourse is free and unhampered; only butchers are avoided because they slaughter animals, which is a crime in the eyes of the people. This 1s another reason why Mohammedans are looked down upon. Till October I 720 Tibet was a monarchy under an absolute and independent king. From that time, however, all power has passed into the hands of the Emperor of China 3) and the actual govern-ment consists of a body of ministers appointed by him, some of whom are Chinese, some Chinese Tartars, others again Tibetans. All decrees must be promulgated in three languages Chinese, Tar-tar and Tibetan.

They collect all taxes and tributes, and forward them to the royal treasury. Every year at the beginning of the Daa Tangbo or of the first moon at the time of the Lo-sar or New-year's feast they must present themselves at Lhasa and disburse their receipts.

Administration of justice. -As a check on petty law-suits it is the rule that on the first hearing each party has to disburse a sum of money va:.:ying with the importance of the case. As a natural result the parties will be more inclined to settle the dispute by private agreement. For the rest the case is very conscien-tiously and expeditiously treated. The oath, however, which is administered in some rare cases, is barbarous and unreasonable. Yet it is practised not only in Tibet but in Nepal and other parts of India. The procedure is the fol-lowing: two stones, one black, the other white are placed in a vessel of boiling oil; the accused is then ordered, if he is conscious he can swear to the truth, to put his hand in the vessel and draw forth one of the stones, with the warning that his taking out the white stone without hurting himself will show forth his innocence. Another way of administering an oath is this: a piece of iron is made red hot and the party in question is ordered to lick it three times with his tongue, being told that he will be considered innocent if he takes no harm. The third and more common way of making a man take a solemn oath is to conduct him to some mountain or other, and there he swears by the Lha or guardian spirit of the place or by other suitable sacred objects invoking their vengeance on himself and his family if he be forsworn. The way in which a capital sentence is carried out varies accord-ing to the quality of the criminal and the malice of the crime. Some are beheaded, some drowned in the river, some bound to a stake and pierced with arrows.

Smaller thefts entail restitution and a public whipping, while in more serious cases the thief has his hand cut off or is branded on the forehead and exiled. In grave cases a man may be punished, though he had no part in the crime, for the mere fact of knowing of the plan and not revealing it. Not only murder and injury but altercation and menace are treated as criminal affairs and punished. Hence one never hears of a man being killed in a brawl, and even cases of injury are rare. In all crime the Tibetans have the greatest fear of the law. Simple fornication is not amenable to punishment, but the father is bound to provide for the child, who remains with the mother. Adultery is punished rigorously. But the severity of the law is softeneCI by the custom of releasing some prisoners at the New-year and other important dates. The land is the king's and the people have only the use of it. Each settlement has its own limited territory, of which the agri-cultural land is shared among the households while the pastures and woods are reserved for common use. Out of the produce of these lands each family pays a certain tax in money or kind into the royal treasury. Moreover, all are liable to compulsory labour, the so-called Ulla, by which a man places his own person, or a substitute, with his beasts of burden at the disposal of the prince or of whomsoever the latter may have given a written authority or Kaa-scioa. The musk-deer is fair game, while gold may be dug for a small consideration to the local governor.

Bread they have none, but in its stead there is the Zzamba, roasted barley-meal mixed with warm water. There is nourishment, too, in their favourite drink Cia, a mixture of tea, putoa (the white powder with its resultant claret colour), milk, butter and salt, all boiled in water; highly esteemed by every Tibetan, it is drunk throughout the day and no friend or guest can be welcomed without it. Though the grape-vine grows in Tibet, wine is unknown; not so Cciang, a kind of barley beer, the whole brewing-process of which is described by Desideri. Of the four kinds only the two milder ones are drunk by women and children, the others two are reserved for men. Though they often drink deep and sometimes too deep, their drunkenness issues at the worst in singing and sleeping, and though their drinking-bouts at weddings and other festivities are sometimes protracted through three days or more they never end in brawls. Monks are forbidden to drink it, but the water being so unwholesome they take it privately B). The use of arrack distilled from this beer is much more restricted. Before every meal a small offering is made to the gods. When on more solemn occasions, such as a wedding or leave-taking, tea or beer is served to persons of distinction the rim of the cup is slightly buttered in three or four places in token of esteem and not for the purpose alleged by Father Ath.

The chapter concludes with a remark on the pine-wood torches used outside at night in some parts of the country, which practice he had also seen ob-served in Nepal.

The complete mastering of the language, he says, would not be so difficult, if they did not write before, behind, above and below the characters which they pronounce, other characters which they do not pronounce; while the difficulty is increased by each of their four vowels, e, i, o, u, having a fourfold value'). His remarks on books, libraries and studies he reserves for the part of his work where he will treat of Buddhist monasteries and universities. The Tibetan people, he goes on, are of a lively disposi-tion and an acute mind, while they are cheerful and industrious. Everyone as a rule can usefully employ himself in various ways, in spinning, weaving, sowing, rope-making; Desideri runs up a list of fourteen industries. Hence it is natural that artisans proper, skilled in but one handicraft, are rarely met with. But painting, sculpture, and casting are not so generally practised. Their works in the first two arts are not of the highest order, though on the other hand they are not to be despised. But in casting statues, vases and musket-barrels they are very proficient.

Medicine is a much sought profession. While well-acquainted with maladies and their causes they diagnose the disease without much questioning; they merely feel the pulse, first right and left alternately, then together. Their medicines, mostly in the form of pills or powders, are not numerous; the few they have are derived partly from their own country, partly from Nepal, China, Hindostan and the Lhoba country. Before the curing of a disease is undertaken, an agreement is made as to the charges 1). The climate, Desideri continues in the following chapter, is healthy, hence there is little sickness. In the larger towns, how-ever, many people suffer from venereal diseases, for which they have excellent remedies, though as a rul'e the cure is but tempo-rary. Almost every ten year:s a large part of the population is in-fected with smallpox and the dea.th-rate rises enormously. For though an infected person is at once carried from his house and quarantined, a great number perish from the wretchedness of their shelter and the insufficiency of the attendance 2). As soon as a man falls ill a Ccio-Kiong, a kind of sorcerer, or a lama is sent for to decide what doctor must be consulted and how the patient is to behave; which decision is scrupulously carried out. Should the patient get worse, a band of monks gather in the house to hold the Corim, that is, they make offerings, while singing prayers to the accompaniment of musical instruments. They fill the rest of the day with reading aloud and together, from some of their books which are called Kaa-n-ghiur. Such a Corim may last one or two or even more days. If the patient's means allow, money is sent to one or more monasteries for a Corim to held there for his benefit. Friends and relations likewise present offerings and make the Khora, or solemn circuit. On recovery another 1) Kawaguchi (p. 487-488) does not think highly of the Tibetan medical men, \"who are utterly incompetent for the important function assigned to them\". From Wad· c:Jell (Lhasa, p. 377) it is clear that feeling the pulse is still the cardinal point in medici· nal art. ') Nearly every writer mentions smallpox, the most deadly disease in Tibet. Thus Hue, Souvenirs,II, 345; Das, p. 167, 206, 225 etc.; Tsybikoff, p. 730 estimates the deaths due to this cause in 1900 at Lhasa and the neigbouring monasteries at ten per cent. of the population.

He has words of approval for the character and the reli-gious sentiment of the Tibetans which he thinks would fit them to receive the Gospel 2). One of the serious obstacles, however, is polyandry, which, though not the rule, is quite common. If the husband has younger brothers, each takes his sister-in-law as his wife and they make one family. The issue that is born is the eldest brother's, and the children are treated as the nephews and nieces of the brothers-husbands. The causes of this custom are two: the meagreness of the soil which on being parcelled out into small lots would not support a family; and the small number of women 3). When the bride is being conducted to the house of the bridegroom, she resists with all her power, and the ceremonial welcome with which she meets there is not attended by her parents \"thus keeping up the fiction that she has been carried off and has married without their consent\" 4).

Strange to say Desideri has not a word on the unutterable filth of the Tibetans, which renders them so offensive to all foreigners and which has been most cuttingly remarl,ed on by the Japanese Kawaguchi (p. 264-267; 407-409). Nor does he refer to the curious fashion of women painting their faces with a black paste before appearing in public, a custom noted by Hue, Rockhill, Kawaguchi and Hedin. According to Hue (Souvenirs, p. 254) this custom dated from some two hundred years back, while Rockhill (Land, p. 214) would suppose it was made compulsory only towards the end of the eighteenth century. Desideri's silence would seem to favour the latter opinion. Landon (I. 6.) it is true cites Grueber's name as bearing witness to this custom; but the nearest approach to any such testimony which the present writer has been able to find has quite a different bearing; let the reader judge for himself: \"Foeminae horum Regnorum adeo deformes sunt, ut diabolis sirniliores quam hominibus videantur, nunquam enim religionis causa aqua se !avant, sed oleo quodam putidissimo; quo praeterquam quod intolerabilem foetorem spirent, dicto oleo ita inquinantur, ut non homines sed lamias diceres\".

Cf. also Das, p. 327, and on Ladakh Drew, p. 250. Kawaguchi (p. 373) looks for the origin of these abominable practices in the old Bon religion.

Desideri winds up his sketch of country and people with some notes on funerals and their entirely unchristian character 3). As in the case of sickness so in the case of death the sorcerer plays an important part since his advice is generally taken and acted upon. Taking account of the social and financial position of the family he will order people of wealth and dignity to cremate the body, a costly affair in a country so badly off for fuel as Tibet. Those who are not so well-to-do may carry the corpse to some holy mountain top, where it is gashed in several places and left a prey to eagles and vultures. Religious are generally thus disposed of. Those who can afford no expense at all carry the body to a certain spot, called Tur-tro, where it is cut in~o small pieces as food for the dogs which wander about there in great numbers. Lastly there is the method of throwing. the body into a river as food for fish. \"When, however, Father Kircher writes,\" Desideri continues, \"that the custom of leaving the dead to wild beasts is due to their opinion that it is the highest honour to have as one's last resting-place the belly of living animals-his theory is more ingenious than true 4). For the reason is quite different; it has a religious basis, and is a consequence of one of their cardinal points of belief: sympathy with all living things. One of the most sublime expres-sions of this belief would be to give oneself to them as food; it being too ·heroic a thing to do so during their life-time, they prefer to put it off till their death. Thus also they are afforded a means of attaining to the most difficult degree of sympathy, for they voluntarily return into the cycle of innumerable trans-migrations in order to deliver others out of it. Yet there is nothing uhreasonable in the bodies of the principal lamas being preserved in urns and venerated; for by their powerful protection they benefit all.

This being Desideri's subject of special interest he enters into it at great length and he has thus given to the world what is probably the most complete survey of the whole Lamaistic system composed by any European, who lived on the spot. As such, however, it falls outside the scope of this work; for the text the reader may be referred to Puini 6). Space must be found, however, for one passage not given by Puini. In the course of his discussions Desideri remarks on the pas-sage where Kircher makes Grueber say that the Tibetans worship the god Manippe with the invocation. \"0 Manippe mi hum\" meaning thereby \"Manippe save us\" 6). For, he says, there is no god bearing that name and the prayer which Grueber has in mind \"Om mani peme hum\" has quite a different meaning. The reader will remember that Andrade did not venture on an explanation of those obscure words, while Della Penna also pre-fers to keep on the safe side: the explanation would be too long, he says 7). Later writers, among whom such scholars as Koeppen and Grunwedel translate: \"0, Jewel in the lotus, Amen,\" and Waddell, \"Om! the Jewel in the Lotus! Hum\"; this formula the latter adds, is addressed to the Bodhisattva Padmapani (A valokitesvara or Chrenresig) the patron-god of Tibet and 1) Andrade, LeUere Annue, p. 14. 1) Klaproth, p. 430-432. •) Rawling, p. 200 ff.

The most recentrendering is von Ow's: \"Praised be thou Om, Jewel in the Lotus! Hum!\"2) What, then, may be Desideri's interpretation of the cryptic saying? \"The word Om,\" he writes, \"is not a significant term but a mere ornament of style, the common opening-word of every charm. The second word M ani means a jewel, such as a pearl, diamond or other precious stones. The third word Peme is a compound of the two words Perna and E. Perna means a flower, that grows in the water, in ponds and lakes; in Hindostani it is called Camel put. The E is a particle of address or invocation as with us the particle 0. The last word again, Hum, is not a signifi-cant term, but a mere ornament, the termination of every magic saying. This being premised, it is necessary for the proper under-standing of this puzzling formula, which does not construe, to remember the Tibetan god Cen-ree sy; he is generally represented carrying a jewel in his hand and seated on a flower, which in their language is called Perna. Hence this Tibetan prayer is nothing but a simple invocation of their god and great protector Cen-ree sy and it means: 0 thou, who holdest a jewel in thy hand and art seated on the flower Perna. The Tibetans say that anciently such a prayer had been taught and recommended to their forbears by the same Cen-ree sy as very acceptable to him, and conducive to their happy and early salvation in the long and toilsome process of metempsychosis\" 3). At an earlier page in this chapter passing reference was made to a political event of the last importance which took place during Desideri's stay in Tibet: the temporary Tartar domina-tion of the country and the subsequent annexation of it by the Chinese.

The military commander or king of Lhasa, Ginghes Khang 2), to whom Desideri paid his respects on his arrival in 1716, had been in power since 1705. In that year he had violently usurped the supreme power by murdering the ruling governor, and had greatly strengthened his position by obtaining the approval of his kinsman the Emperor of China. Naturally he was not on friendly terms with the Dalai Lama. The latter was a dissolute young man, whose conduct offended Ginghes Khang. Friction and trouble were unavoidable. At last the king pretended that the Emperor Kang-hi had invited the Dalai Lama to visit him. The thoughtless youth never suspected the trap laid for him; he set out with a large retinue, and after a couple of days' travelling he was murdered. Before his death the unhappy young man declared he would soon be back; on the Chinese border he would be re-born; they would have to look out for him there . . The immense stir that was created in the monasteries by this crime was but increased when the king on his own authority installed a new Dalai Lama. It was only by exerting the greatest severity that this intruded dignitary could enforce compliance, and the number of malcontents among the lamas was ever on the increase. Plots were formed to oust the two usurpers and the aid of the king of Independent Tartary, who was offered the crown, was secretly solicited. These advances were well received, and to conceal his plans the king proposed a marriage between his daughter and Ginghes Khang's eldest son, who was to come to him to receive his bride. He also asked Ginghes Khang to lend him some troops in a war against Muscovy and for the suppression of a rebellion in J arkant; all of which proposals were agreed to by the Lhasa king a).

Fresh hopes were aroused among the people of Tibet, but at the instance of Ginghes Khang the child was kidnapped and shut up in a fortress by Kang-hP). This second outrage against the sacred person of their spiritual chief was beyond human endurance and the secret machinations became open rebellion. The movement was headed by the three principal monasteries of Breebung, Sera and Shigatse. At their instance the Tartar king crossed into Tibet in 1717 with an army of 6,000 men under the command of General Zze-ring-ton-drup 2), while a second army was directed towards the Chinese frontier to liberate the re-incarnated Lama. Ginghes Khang who as usual was spending the summer months in the country of Dam north of Lhasa, was taken wholly unaware by this sudden attack. His second son succeeded in hurriedly muster-ing some troops and beating off the first attack. For thr~e months the king held his ground in Dam and it was not till the end of October that he fell back on the fortifications of Lhasa. About a month later the Tartars appeared before the town; their arrival had been delayed because they had first awaited the arrival of. the troops sent off to liberate the young Dalai Lama. Though this army had been defeated by the Chinese, Zze-ring-ton-drup was careful to keep the depressing news to himself and to give out a glorious victory. The monasteries of Sera, Breebung and Kaa-n-den supplied the Tartars with victuals, and when in the night of November 30 a general assault on Lhasa was delivered the gates were thrown open by their confederates. In a couple of hours there was nothing left for Ginghes Khang but to seek safety in the Potala Palace. For two days Lhasa was given over to a pillaging soldiery. Desideri was at the Sera monastery so that his belongings were safe except for a few things which he had left with the Capuchins at Lhasa; their house did not escape in the general loot and one of them even sustained personal injury. On 3 December the Potala was assaulted and taken, but the king got away with his son and some grandees through a secret passage. Hotly pursued his horse stumbled, he was taken and killed.

The first minister, Targum-tree-sey was the only one to make good his escape; he reached Gartok where he collected the frontier troops, who had remained loyal and barred the way back to Independent Tartary. The death of his kinsman Ginghes Khang and the raid of the second Tartar army into his own dominions offered a welcome opportunity to the Emperor Kang-hi to assert himself in Tibetan affairs. His first attempt in 1718 failed; the expedition from Hsi-ning across the plateau to Dam came to nought through lack of provisions and discord among the leaders 1). The second was better planned. \"Had I not seen it with my own eyes I would not have believed it\", Desideri narrates; \"but no sooner had the Chinese penetrated into Tibet than the country literally ran over with silver. To supply his wants every soldier had received advance pay for five years in bits of uncoined silver of various sizes. The Tibetans were at a loss how to dispose of this abundance, and sent most of it to Nepal to exchange it by weight for the currency of the country~ out of which transaction the Nepalese made a handsome profit\". In this second expedition, moreover, the Emperor played his highest card. He released the youthful Dalai Lama and sent him with the army. This at once changed the whole face of the situa-tion. Having their religious sentiments satisfied the people sided with the Dalai Lama, and therefore with the Chinese; almost everywhere they took up arms against their recent allies, the Tartars. Desideri himself, who at the time resided at Trong-gnee in Takp6-Khier, one day received orders under pain of death to join the Chinese army within twenty· four hours. He was to appear provided with a horse and arms, and accompanied by two of his followers also armed. The local governor, however, succeeded in getting the order countermanded by the general in command. The Tartar occupants were not to be cowed by a mere martial show. They understood that they had to stake all on the seizure of the Dalai Lama. For three nights running they stormed the Chi-nese camp, but had to retreat after a great carnage without attain-ing their object.

The survivors fled with Zze-ring-ton-drup in the direction of Gartok. Another massacre followed among those who had befriended the Tartars, but at last the storm subsided and in October 1720 the new Dalai Lama ascended the golden throne of the Palace of Po-tala. The temporal sov~eignty, however, had passed into the hands of the Chinese for ever. But few words remain to be said about Desideri's journey back, for we do not mean to follow him far out of Tibet 1). In the early days of 1721 when staying at Trong-g-nee a letter reached him from the General of the Society. It was dated Rome, January 16, 1719 and ordered him to quit the Tibetan mission at the earliest opportunity.

He was accompanied by .the Capuchin Friar Joseph Felix da Morro whose destination was Katmandu.

A common remedy against these discomforts of mountaineering is to chew roasted rice or sugar-candy, or cloves, cinnamon and a kind of Indian nuts, called arecca by the Portuguese. It being impossible to cross the Langur in one day there is a large house where travellers can pass the night. The difficulty of respiration, however, makes it impossible for many to stay indoors and they sleep in the open. The head-aches and other inconviences come to an end together with the crossing.

What is more remarkable is Desideri's suggestion as to the cause of the moun-tain sickness, which more than a hundred years later is still ascribed by Hue, when on the heights of the Burkhan Buddha Range, to the action of carbonic acid 2). After thirty-two days of continuous travel on horseback, on May 30, the two arrived at Kutti or Nilam Dzong. While da Morro soon proceeded on his journey to Katmandu, Desideri resolved to prolong his stay at Kutti till the winter, because otherwise the change from the Tibetan to the Nepalese climate might be too sudden, and \"because during those summer-months influenza is prevalent at Katmandu every year '*ith a very high death-rate\".

The vapours arise during the day to descend again upon every valley and plain during the night; hence this is the time of danger. The disease is practically incurable save by native remedies, the secret o£ which is jeal-ously guarded by the people. They take a drink called Bang, drawn from dry leaves, hemp-leaves one might say or some-thing very like them, but even so a great number perish 1). With long intervals at Patna, Benares and Allahabad the traveller at last arrived at Agra; it was April 22, 1722, sixty years after Grueber and d'Orville had terminated their toilsome wanderings in the same city. Like the latter Desideri was taken seriously ill, which he-ascribes to his rapid transition from an arctic to a tropical climate. But he recovered in the old capital Dehli, where he stayed till 1725, wheR he left for Pondicherry. Tireless as he was he was just engaged in the study of Tamil to make himself useful in the Carnatic mission, when he was told off in January 1727 to carry to Rome a collection of papers and docu-ments concerning another great missionary, Blessed John de Britto. Following the sea-route he passed the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena and Ascension, but a few days after leaving the last-mentioned island an accident compelled the ship to sail to Marti-nique of the Lesser Antilles for repairs. There were no further mishaps, and August 11, 1727, he landed at Port Louis, a small port near Lorient in Brittany. By way of Paris, Marseilles and Genoa he reached Rome, January 23, 1728. It was here that he completed his Notizie Istoriche del Thibet; here, too, he died suddenly April 14, 1733 at the age of forty-nine. In conclusion we may quote the words with which Desideri winds up his account: \"All this I have written after traversing all three Tibets and living in those parts continually for several years; after obtaining, moreover, a knowledge of the language fairly wide and deep, and after reading and examining with pro-1) Desideri, MS.

But he adds that they are liable to catch malaria fever if they come through the Himalaya passes during the summer months.

He meant his narrative to be a solid piece of work and every page we have examined bears witness that it is. As such is has been dealt with by Sven Hedin in his Southern Tibet and after bringing out Desideri's great merits as a contributor to our knowledge of Tibet he concludes: \"Add to this the general merit of his narrative, the absence of fantastical speculation, the quiet matter-of-fact way in which he gives his observations, and nobody will call it an exaggeration if I regard Ippolito Desideri as one of the most brilliant travellers who ever visited Tibet, and amongst the old ones, by far the most prominent and the most intelligent of all\" 2). No candid reader of the preceding pages will demur at this tribute. We have thus come to the end of our task: there are no conclusions to draw beyond those that have, at every turn, suggested themselves to the reader. Both the character of the men and of their work have been submitted to searching, if sympathetic, criticism, and have, we venture to think, stood the test. The work remains the work of pioneers, scrappy, irregular, imperfect, but granite blocks by their very rudeness speak of the immense labour of fashioning them into any shape at all. If the names of those forgotten pioneers, on almost every page, appear side by side with those of the greatest among modern explorers, this in no way detracts from the greatness of the latter. Nay, it lends a new importance to the discoveries of these latter days, since it is only hy the light of modem research and exploration that the work of those who preceded them by centuries can be duly appreciated. And it is thus that the old achievements, undertaken in silent obscurity and carried through at the cost of gigantic personal effort, are dragged forth from the dimness of their remote past, and by the very splen-dour of modern results are lit up with a halo of tragic greatness. 1) MS.

Entre as cauzas que eu acho porque nosso Sen-hor lhe tirou o cetro da mao, foi huma fiarse pouco de Deos neste ponto eo dilatar o sancto Baptismo tanto tempo depois que conheceo a verdade e bon dade de nossa sancta ffe, tam hem em castigo de viver pu blicamente ca-zado com duas irmas alem do que o ajudou a malquistarse com seus vas-salos apenados demaziadamente, donde nasceo chamarem ao seu imigo pera lhe entregarem o Reino; alem de tudo isto o malquistou fazer de mui-tos milhares de lamas deixados os habitos ecclesiasticos soldadesca pera as guerras, golpe que o Demonio sentio nelles tanto que pellos mesmos lhe en-viou a dizer que elle adoeceria em castigo de tal crime, e que quando esca-pace das maos da morte, que seu mor inimigo o de Ladac lhe tomaria o Reino sem golpe de espada eo levaria cativo com toda sua familia. Assy foi que o pobre escapou de huma mortal doen~a, mas nao da trei-~ com que seus vassalos o venderao a seu imigo.

E como sobre a muita benevolencia deste pobre Rey, nosso Senhor fun-dou ou principiou aquella nova christandade, ja V.
