After his pas-sage, his body was duly cremated. But a dispute arose among his lay followers over who should receive the remains, and so the Buddha's relics were divided into eight portions and dis-tributed among the various groups. The ashes from the pyre made a ninth object of veneration, and the bucket used to ap-portion the relics made a tenth. Thus not one but ten stupas were erected .. Not long after the Buddha's death, one of his chief disciples overheard a monk expressing relief that the Buddha was no longer around to scold the monks. Aghast at the sentiment, the disciple convened an assembly of five hundred monks in a cave on Vulture Peak outside the city of Rajag.rha, the site of many of the Buddha's most famous sermons. The purpose of the assembly was to recite what the Buddha had taught, both his discourses as well as the code of monastic discipline. First to speak was Ananda, the Buddha's cousin and personal at-tendant. He had spent more time with the Buddha than any other monk, and the Buddha had promised to repeat to him any discourse he had delivered on those occasions when Ananda was absent. Ananda was also renowned for his prodi-gious memory. At this first assembly, Ananda was called upon to recite everything he had heard the Buddha teach. He began the recitation of each discourse with his personal testimony,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"X INTRODUCTION \"Thus did I hear.\" All texts that purport to be the word of the Buddha begin with this famous phrase. A consideration of the Buddhism of Milarepa, as presented in the biography translated here, might begin by noting that the first chapter of the text starts with the phrase \"Thus did I hear,\" and that it ends with a dispute over Milarepa's relics. These are clear signs that Milarepa was regarded as a buddha by his lineage, and that the author of the biography, Tsangnyon Heruka, made effective use of the tropes of Buddhist literature in the composition of the biography; the story of the distribu-tion of the Buddha's relics and the opening formula of a sutra are renowned among all the Buddhist traditions of Asia. ,A Buddhist sutra begins with \"Thus did I hear,\" and then names the place where the Buddha was residing and who was seated in the audience at the time of the discourse. But here the Buddha is absent, or perhaps more precisely, Milarepa is the Buddha. The scene is not Vulture Peak in India but Belly Cave in Tibet, and the members of the audience are not the famous monks and bodhisattvas of Indian Buddhism, but Milarepa's Tibetan disciples, joined by some local Tibetan dei-ties. The implication of the scene is that there was the Indian Buddha, Sakyamuni; there was Padmasambhava, the Indian tantric master who brought Buddhism to Tibet in the eighth century, sometimes referred to by Tibetans as \"the second Buddha\"; and there is Milarepa, a Tibetan buddha, born and enlightened in Tibet, without going to India or receiving the direct instructions of an Indian master. One of the standard elements of the Mahayana sutras is for Sakyamuni Buddha to praise a buddha who resides in another universe, telling stories of his former lives as a bodhisattva, describing the glories of the buddha field or pure land that he inhabits. In the biography of Milarepa, his disciple Rechungpa (Ras chung pa, ro84-n6r) has a dream in which he finds himself in what seems like a pure land, with buildings made of precious stones and inhabitants dressed in fine brocades. The place is called \"O<;l<;fiyana, Garden of pakinis,\" indicating that it is a special place for tantric practice; Oc,i<;fiyana in northwest India was considered by Tibetans to be the birthplace of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xi Padmasambhava and the place of origin of many important tantric texts and lineages. In this sacred place, Rechungpa is invited to attend the teachings of Ak~obhya (\"Imperturbable\"), the buddha of the East. As Sakyamuni so often did, the buddha Ak~obhya recounts the lives of other buddhas and bodhisatt-vas. He concludes his discourse by saying, \"Tomorrow I shall narrate the life story of Milarepa, which is even more excellent than those I have just described, so come and listen.\" The members of the audience leave the discourse wondering where this buddha Milarepa might reside. Perhaps it is Abhirati, the eastern buddha field of Ak~obhya himself, per-haps it is Akani~!ha, the heaven that is the eighth and highest level of the Realm of Form (ritpadhiitu) and, according to many Mahayana texts, the abode of the enjoyment body (sa1'J'lbhogakiiya) of the Buddha. Rechungpa knows, however, that Milarepa is in neither place, but is rather in Belly Cave, just a few feet away from where he is sleeping. Rechungpa's dream introduces a theme that runs throughout The Life of Milarepa: that there are two parallel universes, one profane and one sacred. In one, Milarepa is an impoverished beggar living on nettles in a cold and barren cave; in the other, he is a highly advanced yogin, practicing blissful sexual yoga with beautiful goddesses; in one, Marpa is a cruel and greedy drunk, demanding payment in exchange for his teachings; in the other, he is a compassionate buddha capable of purging the sin of mul-tiple murder from his disciple; in one, Milarepa is a dangerous sorcerer to be avoided at all costs; in the other, he is a kind teacher willing to teach all who approach, even his evil aunt; in one, Milarepa is a murderer, in the other, he is a buddha. Much of the story is concerned with the failure of those in the first world, beginning with Milarepa himself, to perceive the second. After he becomes aware of the sacred world, Milarepa's compel-ling songs are often intended to shift his listener's perceptions from one world to the other. As Rechungpa's dream intimates, Milarepa occupies both worlds, suggesting that ultimately the two domains are one. Buddhism arrived late in Tibet. The Buddha lived and taught during the fifth century BCE, and in the centuries after his"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Xll INTRODUCTION death his teachings were carried by his monks over most of the Indian subcontinent and north into what is today Kashmir, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. In the third century BCE, Buddhism spread to the island of Sri Lanka, then to China in the first century CE, to Southeast Asia in the third century CE, to Korea in the fourth century, to Japan in the sixth century. Buddhism did not enter Tibet until the seventh century, its influence initially limited to the royal court. The first monas-tery was not established and the first Tibetan monks were not ordained until the late eighth century. A brief period of gen-erous royal patronage for Buddhist institutions and for the translation of Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Tibetan followed, but this was cut short by the death of a pious king in 838 and the succession of his brother, who persecuted Buddhism. This began the so-called dark period in which Buddhism, and especially monastic Buddhism, declined across the Tibetan domain, remaining in the shadows for more than a century and a half. Buddhism returned in the eleventh century, its renaissance sometimes marked retrospectively by three events. The first was the return to Tibet of Rinchen Sangpo (Rin chen bzang po, 958-1055), a monk dispatched to India by the king of west-ern Tibet at the age of seventeen. He would spend the next seventeen years abroad, most of them in Kashmir, returning as a skilled translator of sutras, tantras, and their commentaries. Tbe second event was the arrival of the great Bengali monk Atisa (982-1054), who came to western Tibet in 1042 at the invitation of the local king. He spent the remainder of his life in Tibet, composing his most influential work there. The third were the journeys of Marpa the Translator (ro12-I097) from his home in southern Tibet to Nepal and India, where he received the initiations and instructions that he would pass on to Milarepa. There were other important figures, but these three, two monks and one layman, two Tibetans and one · Bengali, each contributed to different elements that were cen-tral to what Tibetan historians call the \"later dissemination\" (phyi dar)."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xiii Among the one hundred and fifty-seven text translations credited to Rinchen Sangpo, there are many tantras and tantric commentaries, works that set forth the elaborate world of the mandala, the initiations required to enter it, and the practices meant to transform the aspirant into the fully enlightened buddha who sits on the throne at the center of the mandala pal-ace. Atisa, although an accomplished tantric practitioner and exegete, focused his teachings on the practices of the bodhi-sattva, especially the cultivation of the aspiration to enlighten-ment (bodhicitta) and the perfection of wisdom (prajiiiipiiramitii) through insight into emptiness (sunyatii) as set forth by the Madhyamaka philosophers of India. Marpa returned from his journeys to India with tantric texts to be translated but also with oral instructions of the siddha or \"adept\" tradition of Bengal, where enlightenment could be triggered by a spontane-ous song or, as in the case of Naropa, by being slapped on the head with the guru's shoe. These three streams of late Indian Buddhism were just be-ginning to flow freely into Tibet during the eleventh century and the lifetime of Milarepa (ro28/4o-nnh3). But they were flourishing by the lifetime of his biographer, Tsangnyon Heruka (Gtsang Smyon Heruka, 1452-1507). Thus when we consider the Buddhism of Milarepa, at least as represented in his famous biography, we are considering Buddhism as it was understood and practiced in Tibet in the fifteenth century, pro-jected back in time. Nineteenth-century scholars of Buddhism in Europe tended to evaluate the various Buddhist traditions of Asia based on their temporal proximity to the founder. The Theravada tradition of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia-whose canonical language of Pali was linguistically related to the language that the Buddha likely spoke, which was transmitted to Sri Lanka in the centuries immediately following the Buddha's passing, and which rejected the Mahayana sutras as spurious-was sometimes dubbed \"original Buddhism.\" Chinese Buddhism, with its translations of early scriptures lost in Sanskrit, and its sober dedication to the Mahayana sutras, just as they were being composed in the first centuries of the Common Era, was"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiv INTRODUCTION considered an exemplar of what was then called \"Northern Buddhism.\" Tibetan Buddhism was denigrated as the most distant from the pure source, as adulterated with all manner of magical elements from the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet. Indeed, for some it did not merit the name Buddhism and in-stead was called \"Lamaism.\" It is likely the case that the black magic that figures so heavily in the life of Milarepa, first made available to an anglophone audience in the 1928 edition of Walter Evans-Wentz, Tibet's Great Yogf Milarepa, did little to dispel this view. But an alternative view is also possible, not one in which Tibetan Buddhism is suspect because it is not sufficiently early, but one in which it is particularly important because it is so late. Theravada Buddhism was not unaware of the Mahayana sutras; it simply rejected them as the word of the Buddha and generally deemed them unworthy of study. Chinese Buddhism developed as the Mahayana sutras were being composed. It is thus very much a \"sutra-based\" Buddhism, one in which a particular sutra, the Lotus Sutra or the Avata1J1saka Sutra or the three pure land sutras, provided the focus for an entire school or regimen of practice. By the time that the period of the composition of the major sutras was over, Chinese Buddhism had already developed its own forms. The Chinese monk Xuanzang (602-664) departed from the Tang capital in 629 and traveled overland to India to retrieve Buddhist texts, re-turning sixteen years later to make some of the most accu-rate translations from Sanskrit into Chinese ever rendered. But th.e works that he translated were of limited influence because Chinese monks had already developed their own tradition of exegesis of earlier translations of many of the same texts. It was during the period of Xuanzang's sojourn in India that Buddhism was being introduced into Tibet for the first time. Tibet received its Buddhism, especially in the second wave, just as Buddhism was about to disappear from the Indian subcontinent. Indeed, one of the reasons that Atisa came to Tibet in 1042 was the specter of Muslim invasions and the fear that Buddhist monastic universities would be destroyed, a fear that turned out to be justified. Thus Tibet received and made"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION XV accurate translations of the sutras that were so important in China, Korea, and Japan. But it also received and made accu-rate translations of the treatises on Buddhist logic and philoso-phy, including the major works of the Madhyamaka and Yogacara schools as well as the late Yogacara and Madhyamaka synthesis, largely unknown in East Asia. It received and made accurate translations of the extensive literature on the buddha nature, the tathagatagarbha, as well as important commentar-ies on the Perfection of Wisdom sutras, setting forth in great detail the structure of the bodhisattva's path to buddhahood, commentaries that had little influence in China. And Tibet re-ceived the transmission of the tantras, far more than were translated into Chinese, as well as the teachings of the great adepts of medieval India, the mahiisiddhas. From this perspective, then, Tibet received the final flower of Indian Buddhism, the culmination of a tradition that stretched back more than a millennium to the time of the Buddha. The Life of Milarepa is rich in its imagery, woven into the bi-ography by Tsangnyon Heruka, beginning with the introduc-tory verses, where so many of the key terms and doctrines of Buddhism-mainstream, Mahayana, and Vajrayana-are so skillfully evoked. Some of these elements, although familiar throughout Buddhist literature, have a particular motivation here. One such element is lineage, so central to Buddhist histories, where authenticity and authority are measured by the unbroken suc-cession of teacher and student, how this student received this instruction from his teacher, who received it from his teacher, eventually extending back across space-whether it be from Japan back to China or from Tibet back to India-and back across the centuries, ending at the beginning, with the Buddha (or, in the case of the tantras, a buddha) himself. In The Life of Milarepa, lineage is manifest in two ways, one retrospective, one prospective. The author is concerned here, as he is in an-other of his important works, The Life of Marpa, to establish a direct connection between Marpa and the Indian siddha tra-dition, especially with the mahasiddha Naropa. Thus he re-counts Marpa's meetings with Naropa at several points in the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"XVl INTRODUCTION text, and there are constant references to the teachings that Marpa received from Naropa. Marpa did indeed make three trips to India to retrieve tantric teachings. But by the time he made his first trip to India, Naropa had already died; Marpa studied instead with some of Naropa's direct disciples. Works by Marpa's contemporaries make it clear that he never pre-tended to have studied with Naropa. Yet by the time that Tsangnyon Heruka wrote his biographies of Milarepa and Marpa, the lineage of the Kagyu sect-beginning from the buddha Vajradhara, then to Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa, and Milarepa-was well known, and it was necessary that it be reflected in their life stories. Whether Tsangnyon was himself aware of the lacuna in the lineage is not known. Lineage figures prospectively in the form of prophecy. Prophecies are important elements of Buddhist literature, with prophecy (vyakaratza) listed as one of the nine (or twelve) tra-ditional branches of scripture. Thus, in the sutras and legends (avadana), the Buddha will often make a prophecy or predic-tion, usually of the future enlightenment of a member of his audience. Scholars find a different meaning in the Buddha's prophecies, using them to date Buddhist texts. Therefore, if the Buddha makes a prophecy about the emperor A.Soka, this is proof that the text was composed after A.Soka. If the Buddha makes a prophecy about the great Madhyamaka master Nagarjuna, this is proof that the text was composed after Nagarjuna. That is, prophecy is regarded as a device by which Buddhist authors project present importance into the past, en-han·cing that importance by expressing it in the form of a prophecy by the Buddha himself. In The Life of Milarepa, it is not the Buddha who makes a prophecy but Marpa, when he interprets Milarepa's famous dream of the four pillars, each surmounted by a different animal: a lion, a tigress, a garuqa, and a vulture. Marpa identifies the vulture that sits atop the pillar in the north to be Milarepa, with the many small birds that fly above it his disciples. The Kagyu sect, flourishing at the time of Tsangnyon Heruka, originated from one of Milarepa's last disciples, the monk Gampopa (Sgam po pa, 1079-II53), whose own disciples would later found the four"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION XVll major branches of the sect. If the date of Tsangnyon Heruka's works were not known, the presence of this prophecy would help to date the text at a time when the Kagyu sect was al-ready well established, something that was not the case during Milarepa's lifetime. These and many other elements together transform the life story of Milarepa into the biography of a Tibetan buddha. Here, however, there are no stories of the Buddha's former lives. Instead, negative karma that would ordinarily be accu-mulated over many past lives is created by Milarepa in one life, as he murders thirty-five people with a single act of black magic. The horrific karmic consequences of that deed, ordi-narily resulting in many eons in one of the eight hot hells, is here foreshortened by Marpa, whose ruthless compassion forces Milarepa to undergo the suffering over a few short months of pitiful hardship. And rather than perfecting himself over many lifetimes as a bodhisattva, as the Buddha did, Milarepa undertakes the bodhisattva path and completes it in a single lifetime. Unlike the Buddha, who achieved buddha-hood without relying on a teacher in his last lifetime, Milarepa did so through his deep devotion to Marpa and his strict ad-herence to his instructions. Milarepa achieves buddhahood by the rapid method of the tantric path. In mountain caves across southern Tibet, he prac-ticed the stage of generation (utpattikrama), visualizing him-self as a buddha, his own body as a mandala, with various deities located at specific points within it. He then practiced the stage of completion (ni~pannakrama), in which he brought under control the various energies or winds that course through a network of channels in the body, causing those winds to enter the central channel that runs from the crown of the head to the base of the spine, generating both an inner heat (gtum mo) and increasing levels of bliss. Finally, he achieved the mahiimudrii, or \"Great Seal,\" spontaneous realization of the most profound nature of the mind. Yet despite all the references to the stage of generation and the stage of completion, and all of Milarepa's meditation on the t:hannels, winds, and drops, as he approaches the achievement"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"XVlll INTRODUCTION of buddhahood his instructions to those he encounters continue to embody the most basic of Buddhist teachings: impermanence, the sufferings of sarrzsdra, the certainty of death and the uncer-tainty of its arrival, the frightful rebirth that is the direct result of our benighted deeds. Beyond Milarepa's words is his exam-ple, his vivid demonstration, expressed in sublime song, that even one who has murdered thirty-five innocent people can, through devotion to the teacher and the practice of the path, transform oneself into a perfect buddha, where the dharma is present everywhere one turns, where \"everything in the outer world appears as scriptures,\" where the profane is sacred. DONALD S. LOPEZ JR."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Translator's Introduction Milarepa, the eleventh-century poet and meditation master, is perhaps the most recognizable figure in the history of Tibetan Buddhism. In paintings, his slender torso is usually draped with a simple white cotton robe, the attire of a repa (ras pa, literally \"cotton-dad\"), or itinerant yogin. His face may look hollow from years of living in the frigid caves of Tibet's high snow mountains, or it may have a greenish hue from a diet of nothing but the broth of wild nettles. His legs are loosely crossed and wrapped with a special belt to help maintain a proper posture during long meditation sessions. His left hand rests in his lap in a gesture of deep contemplation. His right hand is held to his ear in the pose a singer might strike to bet-ter hear his own voice; his lips may be slightly parted as if singing one of the spontaneous songs of inner realization for which he is so famous. Surrounding him might be the many disciples he taught, or the demons he tamed and converted to Buddhism, or scenes of the miracles he performed. Such images would be instantly identifiable to all Tibetans, even the small community of non-Buddhist Tibetan Muslims and Christians. Members of every sect of Tibetan Buddhism venerate him as an exemplar of religious dedication and mastery. Many can· recite his songs from memory. Most of the stories and attributes associated with the figure of Milarepa stem from a single source: the account of his life translated here, The Life of Miiarepa. It is difficult to overesti-mate the role that The Life of Milarepa has played in shaping the way Buddhism developed in Tibet and later came to be understood in the West. Numerous versions of Milarepa's life"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"XX TltANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION story exist, some written within a generation of the yogin's death in the early twelfth century. The present version, com-posed by Tsangnyon Heruka in the late fifteenth century, al-most four hundred years after Milarepa, draws upon many of these early works. But the resulting narrative eclipsed them all, serving as the canonical record of Milarepa's life ever since. The Life of Milarepa is now famous for its themes of sin and redemption, faith and devotion to the guru, perseverance in the face of hardship, dedication to meditative mastery, and the possibility of liberation in a single life. The story helped estab-lish the founding figures of the Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhism. It shaped the sacred geography of southern Tibet. It served as a vivid inspiration for both the plastic and performing arts across the Himalayas. OVERVIEW OF MILAREPA'S LIFE While The Life of Milarepa paints a striking and often fabu-lous portrait of Milarepa the magician, mendicant, and Buddhist master, we have no independent record of his life from contemporary sources; indeed, we know very little about him as a historical figure at all. Even the dates of his birth and death have long been a source of disagreement among histori-ans, both Tibetan and Western. Tsangnyon Heruka records that the boy was born in the male water-dragon year (1052) and passed away in the wood-hare year (II35) at the age of eighty-four-here using the traditional Tibetan lunar calendar that forms a sexagenary cycle by combining five elements with twelve animals. Other Tibetan sources move these dates back by one or two twelve-year cycles, suggesting instead the years 1040 or 1028 for his birth. Several sources posit his birth as early as 1026 or 1024. Translators of the story outside Tibet have generally agreed upon the dates 1040-1123, although a number of prominent Tibetan scholars of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries favor the earlier span of ro28-1IIr. Regardless of precisely when he was born, Milarepa ap-peared at the beginning of a new wave of Buddhist expansion"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION xxi in Tibet, a period that Tibetan historians would come to de-scribe as the \"later dissemination\" (phyi dar). This is con-trasted with the \"early dissemination\" (snga dar), which took place during the height of the Tibetan empire between the seventh and ninth centuries. The period of early dissemination witnessed the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet, the con-struction of the first Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, and the translation of Buddhist texts from Sanskrit into a new Tibetan language, said to have been developed for that purpose. Traditional histories describe the disintegration of the Tibetan empire in the mid-ninth century, and with it the collapse of Buddhism in central Tibet, ushering in a so-called dark period lasting some hundred and fifty years. Although recent evidence calls into question the extent, and even the existence, of such a dark period, a resurgence of reli-gious activity did begin during the eleventh century in western Tibet, marking the onset of the \"later dissemination.\" This was a period in which Tibetan translators traveled to Nepal and India, where they trained with tantric Buddhist adepts and re-turned bearing new philosophical and ritual texts. Milarepa's principal teacher, known as Marpa the Translator, was one such individual, and famously made three trips to India in search of new teachings. Several sects of Tibetan Buddhism, including Milarepa's own Kagyu (bka' brgyud, \"oral transmission\"), like-wise trace their lineage back to this period. Indeed, members of the Kagyu sect venerate Marpa and Milarepa as the primary founders of their lineage in Tibet. It was during this swell of renewed interest in Buddhism that Milarepa was born in the small village of Kyangatsa in south-ern Tibet, not far from the modern border of Nepal. The Life of Milarepa describes his ancestors as nomads from the north, one of whom was a Nyingma tantric practitioner named Khyungpo Josey. He became famous for his proficiency in sub-jugating harmful spirits, a talent that earned him both re-spect and wealth from the local community. During one such encounter with an especially pernicious spirit, Josey caused the demon to cry out in horror \"mila, mila,\" an admission of submission and defeat, not unlike crying \"uncle.\" Josey then"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"xxii TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION adopted this exclamation as a new clan title and his descen-dants came to be known by the name Mila. Khyungpo Josey's great-grandson eventually gambled away his inheritance and the family was forced to leave in search of a new life elsewhere. Resettling at Kyangatsa, in the region of Mangyul Gungtang, they slowly regained their wealth. This allowed them to purchase agricultural land and construct a new manor house called Kazhi Dunggye (four columns eight beams), an indica-tion of its size, and described as \"one of the most pleasant homes in Kyangatsa.\" Milarepa, and later his younger sister Peta Gonkyi, were thus born into a prosperous and powerful family. At the time of his birth, here revealing the traditional preference for male offspring, his father declared, \"I am delighted to hear the news that the child has been born a son,\" and so named him Topaga, literally \"delightful to hear.\" The boy proved to have a pleasing voice and a natural gift for song, thereby living up to his name. He was later betrothed to a local village girl named Dzese. Toward the end of the first chapter, Milarepa describes his family in this way: \"We held great authority and influence throughout the region, so the local nobility became aligned with our family and the peasants came into our ser-vice.\" At this point in the story, Milarepa seems destined for a quiet and comfortable life. When the boy turned seven, his father was stricken with a fatal illness and prepared a testament that entrusted his wife, children, and wealth to the care of Milarepa's paternal uncle and aunt, with the provision that Milarepa regain his patri-mony when he reached adulthood. The rapacious uncle and aunt instead appropriated the estate for themselves, casting Milarepa's family into a life of terrible poverty. While the boy was sent away to study reading and writing, the relatives forced his mother and sister to labor as servants. \"With flavorless food, tattered clothing, and miserable spirits,\" Milarepa sadly reflects, \"we did not know any happiness.\" Driven to the brink of madness by the decline in their for-tunes, Milarepa's mother then advanced a plan to exact re-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION xxiii venge upon the aunt and uncle, revealing the depth of her hatred in a near-hysterical appeal to her son: I would like to see you drap~d in a fine cloak and mounted upon a horse with your stirrups slashing the throats of our hated en-emies.

Then you should destroy all those who inflicted misery on us, villagers and coun-trymen beginning with your uncle and aunt, cutting off their family lines for nine generations .... Son, if you return without showing signs of black magic in our region, I, your old mother, will kill myself right in front of you. Within the broad context of traditional Tibetan religion, the efficacy of black magic-curses cast from a distance or the manipulation of the weather-was unquestioned. Milarepa dutifully trained first in its rituals, murdering thirty-five peo-ple attending a wedding feast at his aunt and uncle's house. Unsatisfied with this gruesome result, Milarepa's mother then commanded him to cast a powerful hailstorm across his home-land. He did so just as the village's barley crops were about to be reaped, washing away the mountainside and wiping out the entire harvest. Although his revenge seemed righteous, Milarepa felt re-morse at the terrible crimes he had committed. In a major turning point of the story (demarcated by the transition to part two of the narrative), he begins to consider the Buddhist teach-ings as a means for expiating the karmic effects of his sinful deeds.

This perhaps is meant to serve as a foil for the meditation system of the Kagyu sect, and for Milarepa's great determination, described later in the story. Milarepa takes these instructions literally, lazing about in bed and daydream-ing about his newly found good fortune. But it is at this time that he first hears the name of his future guru, Marpa the Translator, which fills him with \"indescribable happiness\" and causes the hairs on his body to \"quiver with joy.\" Once again encouraged by his teacher, he sets out in search of Marpa. Milarepa eventually reached the region of Lhodrak in south-ern Tibet, where he encountered a heavyset plowman standing in his field. In reality this was Marpa himself, who previously had had a vision that Milarepa would become his foremost disciple. He thus had devised a way to greet his future student in disguise. The connection that developed between Marpa and Milarepa would become the most celebrated story of the teacher-disciple relationship in Tibetan Buddhism and an ex-emplar of the fundamental importance of devotion to a spiri-tual guide. Marpa, however, was famous for his fierce temper and did not immediately teach Milarepa. Instead, he subjected his new disciple to a continual stream of verbal and physical abuse, forcing Milarepa to endure a series of ordeals, includ-ing, in one of the story's most memorable episodes, the con-struction of four immense stone towers. Pushed to the brink of despair, Milarepa first plotted his escape and later contem-plated suicide. But just when all hope seemed lost, Marpa re-vealed that Milarepa was, from the beginning, a disciple prophesied by his own guru, the Indian master Naropa. He further explained that the trials were actually a means of puri-fying the sins committed earlier in his life. Milarepa then re-ceived numerous tantric initiations and instructions that Marpa had brought from India-especially those of tummo (gtum mo) or yogic heat, the so-called aural transmissions (snyan rgyud), and the meditation system on the quintessential nature of mind called Great Seal (mahamudra). Marpa famously com-manded Milarepa to spend his life meditating in solitary caves and mountain retreats, persevering against all hardship."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION XXV Milarepa returned briefly to his homeland, only to find his mother long dead, her bones lying in a dusty heap among the ruins of his family house. Profoundly moved by this illus-tration of impermanence, he retired to a series of retreats not far from his home. Most famous among these is Drakar Taso (White Rock Horse Tooth), where he remained for many years in arduous meditation. With nothing but wild nettles to eat, his body withered and grew increasingly weak, while his flesh turned pale green, resembling that of a nettle worm. At last, after many years persevering in meditation practice, Milarepa gained a deep experiential realization about the true nature· of reality and a mastery of the fundamental Buddhist truths, which he describes in this way: Thus, in general I understood all phenomena of life's round and transcendence to be interdependent. I further ascertained that the underlying basis of mind is free from biases. Life's round is the result of the path conditioned by wrong views. Transcendence is the result of the path conditioned by insight. The essence of both is emptiness and luminosity. From that point on, Milarepa found himself able to perform all manner of miracles, transforming his body into fire or water and flying through space. At the conclusion of chapter ten, the central narrative of Milarepa's life comes to a close: he has become a realized yogin, deeply experienced in the practice of meditation and no longer encumbered by worldly expecta-tions or societal norms. In a final act he forgives his aunt, both the cause of his worldly misery and the catalyst for his reli-gious career, and then teaches her the dharma-illustrating a bodhisattva's perfect forbearance, and perhaps also a literary device, bringing the story full circle. Chapter eleven poses a challenge for readers unfamiliar with the broader tradition of Milarepa's biography; its bewilder-ing lists of retreat sites and disciples break the narrative so carefully constructed up to this point. As early versions of Milarepa's life story coalesced, authors began inserting dozens of chapters (in some instances, more than seventy) into the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"XXVI TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION break between the yogin's first extended meditation retreats and his death. These were cycles of religious poetry framed by brief narrative vignettes, and they recorded Milarepa's mature teaching career, his subjugation of harmful spirits, and his gathering of disciples at various locations across southern Tibet. Perhaps most importantly, they also catalogued the many songs of practical instruction and inner realization he famously sang throughout his life. These additional chapters more than doubled the length of the text, creating a cumber-some if comprehensive record. Tsangnyon Heruka was the first author to separate the biography proper from these narra-tive vignettes and compose two independent texts. The former became The Life of Milarepa translated here; the latter is the acclaimed The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa (Rje btsun mi Ia ras pa'i mgur 'bum), translated into English in 1962 by Garma C. C. Chang. The hundred thousand in the title is not a literal reckoning, but rather a convention meaning \"many\" or \"all,\" so the collection claims to contain everything Milarepa ever taught. Freed from the complex and lengthy sto-ries of The Hundred Thousand Songs, the biography could now be read as a seamless narrative, spanning Milarepa's birth and training to his liberation and final passing. This chapter thus summarizes all the various song cycles that were stripped out and published separately in The Hundred Thousand Songs. Indeed, at its conclusion the author explicitly notes, \"These [events] are described at great length in the context of The Hundred Thousand Songs.\" Even though it covers the latter half of Milarepa's life with great brevity, the chapter still serves several important functions. First, it delin-eates all of the places Milarepa practiced meditation, effec-tively mapping out the sacred geography of the yogin's life for future practitioners and pilgrims. Many of these sites were caves, referred to as \"fortresses\": the six well-known outer for-tresses; the six unknown inner fortresses; and the six secret fortresses, with the addition of several other locations. While such lists appear in earlier works, here the sites are each named by Milarepa himself, thus projecting upon them the legitimacy of the yogin's direct prophecy: \"If you meditate in these places,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION xxvii favorable circumstances will converge in your solitude and you will receive blessings of the lineage. Therefore, meditate in them.\" By this device, much of southern Tibet, extending into Nepal, is claimed for the Kagyu sect by Milarepa's biographer. The chapter also records the names of Milarepa's foremost disciples and establishes their roles in transmitting the Kagyu sect's teachings stemming from Milarepa and Marpa. Perhaps the most vivid episode of Milarepa's life is his death, described in the final chapter. The account is filled with mi-raculous visions and signs, befitting the final passing of a buddha. The Buddha's death is said to have been caused by food poisoning; Milarepa was given poisoned food by a jeal-ous geshe. Like the Buddha, Milarepa's body was to be cre-mated. The pyre beneath the Buddha's body would not ignite until his disciple Mahakasyapa arrived; Milarepa's body would not burn until Rechungpa appeared. The Buddha's remains first caused a dispute over their ownership, but later served as relics to be venerated. Milarepa's disciples argued over who should take ownership of their master's remains, but here the narratives diverge. Milarepa's disciples awaken one morning to find his corporeal relics being spirited away to a celestial realm by t;lakin'i goddesses. One earlier version of the biogra-phy presents a slightly different account. There, Milarepa's rel-ics are divided into two portions, one of which is given to his divine consort Tseringma. A voice from the heavens then com-mands the disciples to cast the remaining relics into two nearby rivers, thus liberating all beings who come into contact with their waters. In both stories we find a rebuke of the disciples' fixation on the cult of relics, perhaps as a means for universal-izing the yogin's teachings by detaching them from reliquaries and the monasteries that are inevitably built around them. Regardless, the disciples were left with little more than a strip of Milarepa's robe, a knife and flint steel, and a portion of rock sugar. But they also retained· their memories of the de-parted guru, his teachings on the nature of mind, his songs of realization, and his vivid example of perseverance in the face of all adversity-the elements that would later constitute the relic of his life story."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"XXVlll TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION THE LIFE OF MILAREPA AS A WORK OF LITERATURE Since at least the nineteenth century, The Life of Milarepa has served as a primary source for the Western study of Tibet's re-ligious and literary traditions. It was the first complete Tibetan text to be translated into English (although it was not the first to be published), and scholars quickly recognized the literary merits of Tsangnyon Heruka's work. The text is now regularly hailed as an exemplar of world literature. But The Life of Milarepa also served as a model for Tibetan biographers. The most common form of biography in Tibet is called a namtar (rnam thar), literally \"complete liberation,\" signifying a liter-ary genre that recounts the lives of religious figures with an emphasis on their practice of the Buddhist path and their spiritual awakening. Tibetan biographies are often filled with visions and miracles, as is The Life of Milarepa. For this rea-son, Tibetan namtars are frequently equated with the hagiog-raphies of medieval Europe, which record the often fabulous lives of Christian saints. Tibetan biographies, however, vary widely in terms of both content and style. One common taxonomy, into outer, inner, and secret biographies, gives some indication of this diver-sity. While an outer biography might recount an individual's mundane affairs, such as places visited and people met, inner biographies could focus on the subject's religious career, re-cording long lists of teachings received and meditation retreats undertaken. Secret biographies frequently record the visions and experiences gained through intensive meditation retreat. The Life of Milarepa does not strictly fit into any of these cat-egories, yet portions of the story seem to reflect something of each. Tibetan literature also preserves numerous examples of autobiographical writing, although the line between biogra-phy and autobiography was not always firmly established or maintained; such is the case with The Life of Milarepa. One of Tsangnyon Heruka's central innovations was tore-cast Milarepa's biography in the form of an autobiography. The switch to a first-person account, narrated by Milarepa"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION XXlX himself, is a literary artifice, but one that nevertheless creates a compelling story while also investing the text with an au-thority derived from personal testimony. There is also strong evidence to suggest that Tsangnyon Heruka believed himself to be Milarepa's reincarnation, an assertion that his followers promoted. In this case, the biography of Milarepa might then be understood not as an artificial autobiography but a real one, with the author speaking as his. own biographical subject, recounting the events of a former life, a venerable genre in Buddhism. Another important change that Tsangnyon Heruka made was to structure the biography in the form of a traditional ac-count of the Buddha's life. The text's twelve chapters, each described as recording a specific deed Milarepa performed, are roughly modeled after the twelve acts of the Buddha as pre-served in most Tibetan accounts. Rechungpa requests Milarepa to tell his life story by noting, \"Precious Jetsiin lama, buddhas of the past taught their inconceivable life stories consisting of twelve deeds and the like for the benefit of sentient beings.\" Rechungpa's unspoken suggestion is that Milarepa should do the same. The author explicitly outlines the text in this way, where Milarepa's twelve \"marvelous and amazing deeds\" are divided into three \"ordinary deeds\" and nine \"supreme deeds of peace and transcendence.\" This framework, however, is lit-tle more than a conceit and most chapters bear only a gen-eral resemblance to traditional enumerations of the Buddha's deeds, which are often presented as follows: (r) descending from Tu~ita heaven; (2) entering the womb of his mother; (3) birth; (4) education as a youth; (5) marriage and birth of a son; (6) renunciation; (7) practicing austerities; (8) meditating under the bodhi tree; (9) subduing the demon Mara; (ro) attaining buddhahood; (rr) teaching the dharma; and (12) death and parinirtiit:za. The text more closely resembles the Buddha's life story in its introductory framing tale, discussed in Donald Lopez's \"The Buddhism of Milarepa\" above. The story opens with the words \"Thus did I hear,\" the phrase attributed to the Buddha's dis-ciple Ananda, reflecting his perfect memory of everything the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"XXX TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION Buddha ever taught. These words signify that what follows is considered the authentic word of the Buddha (buddhavacana). In this way too, the present version of the biography has come to be accepted as the authentic words of Milarepa, and in this sense it has become the canonical version of his life. The life story thus resembles the famed Lalitavistara Sutra, a much-revered Mahayana text in which the Buddha narrates the events of his life at the request first of a group of Hindu gods led by Isvara, and later by an assembly of his disciples. The life story then unfolds as a kind of religious teaching. If Milarepa has taken the place of the Buddha, his biography has become his teaching, the dharma. There are many ways to read The Life of Milarepa. One would be for its presentation of the Buddhist path to libera-tion,· which is how audiences have traditionally approached the story. The text is also valuable for readers interested in the social history of eleventh-century Tibet, at least as imagined four hundred years later. We find descriptions of village life and social structures, marriage conventions, travel customs, architectural design, and even the prominent role religious texts played as a form of family wealth. Milarepa occasionally discusses complex questions of Buddhist philosophy using the technical vocabulary of the tradition. But we also find in the story the theme of anti-intellectualism (Milarepa's murderer is depicted as a vain scholar of philosophy) and a disdain for in-stitutions of religious hierarchy (he dismisses as fraudulent the wealthy monk Bari Lotsawa). These themes both seem to re-flect Tsangnyon Heruka's own fifteenth-century perspective. The text also reveals Tibetan tastes in humor, as when Milarepa concludes his final written testament, after leading his disciples to believe they will inherit his hoard of gold, \"Whoever says that Milarepa possessed gold, fill his mouth with shit.\" Perhaps the most celebrated elements of The Life of Milarepa, and even more so of The Hundred Thousand Songs, are the yogin's poems interspersed throughout the narrative. These are presented as songs of awakening (mgur), spontaneous ex-pressions of meditation experience and realization that served"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION XXXI as one of Milarepa's principal methods of instruction. Such poetry is deeply influenced by the Indian styles of tantric songs-the dohii, vajragiti, and caryiigiti-employed by great adepts such as Naropa. Marpa and Milarepa are among the first Tibetans to make extensive use of these forms. Milarepa, famous for his singing voice even as a young boy, incorporated both the themes and structures of Tibetan folk songs and epic verse, creating a vernacular form of religious poetry. Beginning in the thirteenth century, a more ornate style of poetry devel-oped in Tibet, in part modeled after early Indian writers such as DaQ.c;lin (seventh century) and his seminal treatise the Mirror of Poetry (Kavyiidarsa). Although far removed from the direct style of Milarepa's songs, verses of this type open and close the text as, Tsangnyon Heruka notes in the colophon, \"embellish-ments\" serving a \"feast for scholars fond of grandiloquence.\" AUTHOR OF THE LIFE OF MILAREPA: THE MADMAN OF TSANG Nowhere in the text of The Life of Milarepa does the author record his name. Instead, in the colophon at the conclusion of the story he signs the text with the epithet \"Rupe Gyenchen (dressed in bone ornaments), the yogin who wanders in charnel grounds.\" This image is that of the tantric siddhas of India, antinomian figures who lived on the margins of society, far from both village and monastic life. The name was cause for confu-sion among early translators of the biography, who either read the first-person narrative as an autobiography in Milarepa's own hand or saw the framing tale as an indication that the story was written by Rechungpa, Milarepa's close disciple. It was not until the 196os that scholars of Tibetan literature identified the author of the narrative as the individual called Tsangnyon Heruka, the \"Madman of Tsang.\" Tsangnyon Heruka was born in 1452, a period of regional and sectarian conflict in central and western Tibet. (Tsang is Tibet's western province and thus forms the first syllable of his name.) But it was also a time of great religious and intellectual"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"XXXII TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION innovation. He was one of several individuals identified during this period as religious madmen. The unconventional conduct of such figures is traditionally believed to reflect a profound realization of the true nature of reality, one that no longer dis-criminates between pure and impure, virtue and sin, secular and sacred. Modern scholars have interpreted such behavior as a reaction against the rising wealth and power of Tibet's monastic institutions by returning to a model of the itinerant yogin's life. Indeed, Tsangnyon Heruka spent much of his adult career emulating Milarepa. Although Tsangnyon Heruka was ordained as a monk in his youth, at the age of twenty-one he renounced his monastic vows. He trained under teachers from various sects of Tibetan Buddhism, but his central interest was the so-called aural trans-missions of Rechungpa (ras chung snyan rgyud), a corpus of carefully guarded tantric instructions passed on from Niropa to Marpa to Milarepa, and then taught by Milarepa's disciple Rechungpa. He ttien spent many years in solitary retreat, dur-ing which time he exhibited transgressive and antinomian be-havior. Upon his returning from the mountain wilderness of Tsari in southern Tibet with his body smeared in human ashes and blood and the fingers and toes of human corpses woven into his hair, local villagers are said to have given him the title Nyonpa (smyon pa), or \"madman.\" He later received the epi-thets Traktung Gyalpo (khrag thung rgyal po), \"King Blood Drinker,\" which incorporates the Tibetan translation for the Indian term heruka (khrag thung) that forms the second part of hls name. Even as Tsangnyon Heruka largely rejected Tibet's tradi-tional Buddhist institutions, he also formed close ties with powerful political leaders in Tsang, who would support his re-ligious activities. He visited Nepal three times, sponsoring major renovations of the famed Buddhist stupa and pilgrimage center of Swayambhii. He was also enlisted to broker peace ne-gotiations between warring factions of western Tibet and Nepal. But Tsangnyon Heruka is perhaps best remembered for his major literary projects, including biographies of both Marpa and Milarepa. Traditional accounts of the madman's own life"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION xxxiii record that a visionary encounter with Naropa-inspired him to write The Life of Milarepa. But we may also understand his biographical writings as a means for establishing the unequivo-cal authority of the early teachers of the Kagyu sect, of the in-structions they transmitted, and of the yogic practices they espoused. The colophon informs us that Tsangnyon Heruka completed the text in 1488. He was the first author to publish and distrib-ute a printed· edition of Milarepa's life story, with each page of text meticulously carved in reverse onto wooden blocks, which were then inked to make impressions on long strips of paper-a practice that had only recently become widespread in central Tibet at that time. He then distributed his new biog-raphy to the leading religious and political figures of the re-gion. It was perhaps the printed form of the text that allowed it to circulate as widely as it did and which accounts, at least in part, for its widespread fame. This seems to have been the au-thor's intention from the start. Traditional records make it clear that he desired to create a story that would appeal to members of all levels of society-from kings and ministers, to the religious elite, to lay householders-as a means for inspir-ing faith, accumulating virtue, and progressing on the path toward buddhahood. There is no doubt that The Life of Milarepa accomplished that task. More than five centuries later, it continues to do so. A NOTE ON TRANSLATORS, TRANSLATIONS, EDITIONS, AND TEXTS The first translation of The Life of Milarepa into a foreign lan-guage was a Mongolian edition completed in I6I8. By the late nineteenth century, both Milarepa and his biography had be-come an important subject of study for scholars of Tibet in Europe and North America. The Life served as a principal ref-erence for the Tibetan-English dictionaries of the Moravian missionary H. A. jaschke and the British spy Sarat Chandra Das, published in I88I and I902 respectively. In I925, the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"xxxiv TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION French Tibetologist Jacques Bacot published an extensive, though incomplete, translation of the biography under the title Le poete tibetain Milarepa: ses crimes, ses epreuves, son Nirvana. Although Bacot omitted the final chapter describing Milarepa's death, this was one of the first comprehensive ac-counts of a Tibetan figure in a European language, and the translation remains an impressive achievement. The story appeared in English for the first time in 1928 as Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa, the second of a quartet of books edited by W. Y. Evans-Wentz, an eccentric American spiritual seeker and would-be scholar. Although Evans-Wentz could not read Tibetan, he collaborated with the Sikkimese national Kazi Dawa Samdup (1868-1922), who was employed at the time as the headmaster of the Maharaja's Bhutia Boarding School in Gangtok and later taught at the University of Calcutta. Dawa Samdup had worked intermittently on a translation of the Life between 1902 and 1917, well before Bacot's publication ap-peared. But it was only after the Sikkimese translator died in 1922 that Evans-Wentz took an interest in the account of Milarepa's life. He received the manuscript of Dawa Samdup's translation from the translator's family in 1924 and published it four years later. Although this constituted the first complete English translation of the story (lacking only the opening . kavya-style verses), its language is encumbered by an exces-sively biblical style, likely added by Evans-Wentz to Dawa Samdup's generally accurate translation. The text achieved even greater fame in the West through the efforts of Lobsang Lhalungpa (1924-2008), who published a new translation in 1977 as The Life of Milarepa. Lhalungpa served as a government official in Tibet prior to exile; he later acted as an interpreter for the fourteenth Dalai Lama and pioneered the first Tibetan-language program for All India Radio. Although occasionally erring when addressing Buddhist terminology and often overly free in its rendering of poetry, Lhalungpa's translation effectively served as the voice of Milarepa for a generation of readers.

Although prints from Tsangnyon Heruka's original wood blocks have not yet come to light, nearly two dozen editions are known to have been printed across Tibet by the mid-twentieth century. For the present translation I have relied mainly on the critical edition by J. W. de Jong, who in turn based his work on editions produced in four locations: Spung thang, Bstan rgyas gling, Spo, and Bkra shis lhun po. I have also extensively consulted the editions from Ron 'Od gsal phug (perhaps the oldest extant edition) and Sde dge, as well as the modern Chinese reprint. For com-parison, I have read many parallel sections from versions of the life story that predate Tsangnyon Heruka's text, including the so-called Twelve Great Disciples (Bu chen bcu gnyis), A River of Blessings Relieving the Tormenting Heat of the Mental Afflictions (Byin brlabs kyi chu rgyun gyis nyon mongs pa'i tsha gdung sel bar byed pa), and The Life of ]etsun Milarepa: An Illuminating Lamp of Sun and Moon Beams (Rje btsun mid la ras pa'i rnam par thar pa gsa[ byed nyi zla'i 'od zer gyi sgron ma) by G.yung ston Zhi byed Ri khrod pa (born ca. 1320). In the translation, I have generally sought to strike the deli-cate balance between faithfulness to the text and transparency of its meaning. I have attempted as much as possible to avoid the technical jargon of Buddhism and \"translationese\" by ren-dering all words into English instead of reverting anachronis-tically to Sanskrit-recognizing of course that this runs the risk of creating a new form of English jargon. Some terms may therefore appear unconventional (such as \"life's round\" for the Tibetan 'khor ba [sa1Jtsara]). I have left several Tibetan words untranslated, including repa (ras pa), and Jetsiin (rje btsun). The former economically avoids repeating the somewhat cum-bersome \"cotton-clad,\" especially in songs where Milarepa uses the term self-referentially. The term Jetsiin, a title of re-spect, renders the Sanskrit bhaffiiraka and is difficult to trans-late precisely. One , Tibetan dictionary glosses it as follows:"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"XXXVI TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION \"Someone described as a lord (rje) because he is like a helms-man among guides for others on the path to liberation, and as venerable (btsun) because he is utterly unsullied by the non-virtues of the three gates.\" In accordance with this definition, the term is frequently translated as \"Venerable Lord.\" The title is found ubiquitously in reference to the yogin, sometimes to-gether with the name Milarepa, and frequently in the abbrevi-ated form Jetsiin Mila. In some cases, he is referred to simply as \"the Jetsiin.\" I have therefore chosen to treat it as part of his personal name. For clarity, I have added several section ti-tles lacking in the original text: Prologue, Milarepa's Disciples, and Colophon. It is often noted that translations are necessarily inadequate renderings of the original. Jorge Luis Borges's essays on trans-lation suggest instead that \"every translation is a 'version'-not the translation ... but a translation, one in a never-ending series, at least an infinite possible series.\"' So too, this transla-tion of The Life of Milarepa serves as a translation, one that seeks to provide a clear English meaning for Milarepa's elo-quent Tibetan words.

For this, may the lama and 4akinis grant their permission. In the beginning of his life, here in the snowy land of Tibet, he developed a feeling of weariness toward the vast shortcomings of life's round, which is like a pit of fire, and a sense of renuncia-tion.

He was cared for by his chosen deities and qakinis, and with obstacles cleared away and his practice enhanced, his ex-periehce and realization increased so that he gained mastery in the dharma. Perfecting his devotion toward previous masters of the lineage, he received the transmissions on compassion. Thus he was endowed with the marks of the lineage's limitless and unparalleled blessings. Through the power of his expan-sive and powerful enlightened attitude, beings lacking the ha-bitual patterns of virtue who merely heard his teachings or even his name transformed their outlook, developed goose bumps of faith, and were moved to tears. Thus he sowed in them the seed of enlightenment and was able to protect them from all fear of life's round and of birth in the lower realms. Maintaining the key points of the path of the messengers of Secret Mantra, the celestial wisdom consorts aroused in his body the bliss of the wisdom of the four joys and helped him to accomplish the path.

The power of his wisdom and love was unfathomable, so he was able to guide sentient beings who had been born as animals and estab-lish them on the path of ripening and liberation. He had no need to accept or reject the eight worldly concerns or to save face, so he remained a magnificent, serene, and resplendent ob-ject of veneration for all beings, including gods and humans, and they all bowed their heads to him. He developed perfect diligence cultivating the profound path, so he became an unri-valed master, an object of worship by bodhisattvas like himself. With the great lion's roar of selflessness actually experienced, he overwhelmed the wild game of perverted views and strode like an unbridled white lion through the expanse of snow moun-tains, space without middle or edge. Inwardly, he mastered the meditative absorption of totality, so outwardly he overwhelmed and overcame all harmful forces comprised of the four elements, turning them into companions. He held firm control over subtle energies and mind, so he was able to demonstrate amazing be-havior such as soaring in the sky like a bird as he moved and rested. He could perform all kinds of physical miracles, such as transforming his body into blazing fire, swirling water, or what-ever else he desired, so he was able to dispel the wrong views of those who held them and instill in such individuals perfect view, meditation, conduct, and results. He perfected the practice of th~ four initiations, so heroes and qakinis gathered like clouds at the twenty-four sacred lands of his vajra body and he became a Heruka lord of their assembly. He possessed a confidence that showed no fear, so he overwhelmed the eight classes of gods and demons and they carried out his commands, allowing him to spontaneously conduct the four kinds of activity. He was a skilled craftsman who understood that all things have the nature of emptiness-luminosity.

He was an expert on valid cognition who clearly perceived all hidden phenomena, both good and bad such as the minds of others, and directly ascertained that all objects of knowl-edge lack a self. He was a great pa1J4ita of the essential truth who recognized all outer phenomena as inner awareness, and determined that the mind is primordially luminous, unborn, and empty, and that it is self-liberated, inseparable from the three bodies, a natural display that arises without obstruction. He was able to visit, by miraculous means, limitiess buddha fields of all-encompassing purity in a single instant. By virtue of his pure activities, he became the topic of dharma exposition and study by the buddhas and bodhisattvas in those realms. Thus the buddha fields were entirely cleansed and purified. For the six kinds of sentient beings, he manifested according to their individual levels of good fortune and taught the truth of the Victors' intentions by using dharma examples appropriate to their intellect and in accord with their worldly perceptions. Thus he ripened and liberated them. In short, in one life and one body, he attained the four bodies and the five wisdoms, the high state of the great sovereign lord Vajradhara. In a state of immeasurable compassion, he taught the unsurpassed dharma and thereby released untold sentient beings from unbearable misery. Thus he was transported to the citadel of great bliss, the four bodies, spontaneous great liberation, where he remains, a supreme individual, the very best of men. The amazing and wondrous deeds of the individual called Lord Jetsiin Mila Zhepa Dorje, who is as famous as the sun and moon, as they were perceived by his most excellent disci-ples, are inexpressible and beyond comprehension. However, while the preceding eulogy approximates them in brief and his deeds as they were perceived by his ordinary disciples are inex-pressible and beyond comprehension, they can be succinctly divided into two parts: (I) the ordinary worldly deeds and (2) the deeds of supreme peace and transcendence. The first part has three chapters: (I) the deed of his birth, together with"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"8 TSANGNYON HERUKA the reason his paternal family was named Mila and the ori-gins of his ancestral lineage; (2) the deed in which during his youth, with his father dead, his nearest relatives rose up as en-emies and, bereft of both inner and outer possessions, he expe-rienced the truth of suffering in its entirety; and ( 3) the deed in which, encouraged by his mother's command, he accomplished the activity of wrathful intervention and then annihilated his enemies. I begin with the first. Here I set forth an introduction to the amazing life story."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"PART I"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE E rna ho.3 Thus did I hear. At one time the Powerful Lord of Yogins, the great Heruka himself greatly renowned as Jetsiin Mila Zhepa Dorje, was residing in the sacred place called Dropa Puk in the region of Nyanam, turning the wheel of the Great Vehicle dharma seated in the midst of his heart-disciple yogins, bodhisatt-vas abiding on the spiritual grounds, including Rechungpa Dorje Drak, Repa Zhiwa 0, Ngandzong Repa, Seban Repa, Khyira Repa, Drigom Repa, Lengom Repa, Repa Sangye Kyap, Shengom Repa, Dampa Gyakpuwa, and Tonpa Sakyagm,1a; his fortunate male and female disciples such as Lekse Bum and Shendormo; rainbow body Q,akin'is such as the five Sisters of Long Life; and also gods of completely pure lineage, together with an assembly of human yogins and yoginis. At that time, Rechungpa was resting in meditation within his retreat cell. During the course of an entire night, he had the fol-lowing dream: In a lovely and enchanting land called 049iyana Khandroling (Garden of I)akin'is), he entered a great city where the houses and their foundations were all made from precious gems. The inhabitants of this city were all dressed in silken robes and adorned with ornaments of bone and jewels; they all had pleasing features and were beautiful to behold. Without uttering a word, they all exchanged glances, smiling joyfully. Among them was Bharima, the female disciple of lama Tipupa whom he had met previously in Nepal. She wore a red robe, carrying herself as the city's principal figure. \"Nephew, welcome,\" she said. \"How excellent that you have come.\" She then led him inside a house made of precious gems, filled with an inexhaustible store of objects to delight the senses."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"12 TSANGNYON HERUKA As a host would her guest, she plied him with the excellent and refined service of food and drink. She said, \"At present, the buddha Ak~obhya is teaching dharma in OQ.giyana. Therefore, nephew, if you wish to request the dharma, I shall ask his permission.\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said Rechungpa, who felt a strong desire to listen to him. And so they departed together. At the city's center, Rechungpa saw the Blessed One Ak~obhya, more exalted than he had previously imagined, seated upon a high throne made from precious gems, teaching the dharma in the middle of an ocean-like assembly. Intoxicated with bliss and well-being, he felt as if he would faint. Then Bharima said, \"Nephew, stay here a moment. I will ask for permission from the buddha.\" She went to make her re-quest and was granted permission. She led the way and they arrived in the presence of the buddha. Rechungpa prostrated himself at the buddha's feet, requested blessings, and sat before him listening to the dharma. The buddha smiled and Rechungpa thought, \"The buddha has been gazing directly at me for a lit-tle while and is thinking of me with affection.\" The dharma discourse focused entirely upon the genealogies, birth accounts, deeds, and life stories of all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and as the buddha taught them, Rechungpa felt a faith that caused the hair on his body to quiver. Finally, here-counted the life stories of Tilopa, Naropa, and Marpa, which were more extensive and even more amazing than when the jetstin had told them previously. The entire assembly was thus completely overcome with faith. At the conclusion of his religious discourse, the buddha said, \"Tomorrow I shall narrate the life story of Milarepa, which is even more excellent than those I have just described, so come and listen.\" Some in the assembly said, \"There couldn't be any-thing more excellent than the previous accounts; if there were it would be a marvel of immeasurable proportions.\" Others said, \"The spiritual qualities of those who were previously de-scribed are fruits attained through the accumulation of merit and the purification of obscurations during the course of many lifetimes. Milarepa attained spiritual qualities not inferior to"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MlLAREPA I3 those previous masters in one lifetime and one ·body.\" The first people said, \"Well then, if there is such a marvelous dharma teaching and we failed to request it for the benefit of sentient beings, we would be unfit disciples. We should therefore have strength and determination in our three gates, and request it for the benefit of beings.\" Someone else asked, \"Where does Milarepa currently re-side?\" Some said, \"He resides either in Abhirati or Akani~~ha.\" Rechungpa then thought, \"The Jetsi.in presently resides in Tibet. In any case, I am inspired by such talk, so I should by all means request the Jetsi.in's life story for the benefit of beings.\" As he was thinking this, Bharima took hold of Rechungpa's hands and while shaking them said, \"Nephew, you have un-derstood. Nephew, you have understood.\" Rechungpa awoke from this dream just as dawn was break-ing. His awareness was clearer and his practice more potent than ever before. Reflecting on the dream, he thought, \"It is amazing indeed that I listened to the dharma from Ak~obhya amid an as-sembly of OQ.giyana qakin'is. Yet it is more amazing still to have met the Jetsi.in lama. Even my listening to Ak~obhya's teachings is due to the Jetsi.in's kindness. Those people said that the Jetsi.in dwelled in either Abhirati or Akani~~a.\" But then he scolded himself, \"You belittled the lama, think-ing he resides in Tibet. In this way, you showed your lack of respect, putting yourself on his level. In general, since the Jets lin is a buddha, his activities of body, speech, and mind are be-yond comprehension. In particular, wherever the Jetsi.in abides is itself Abhirati and Akani~~a. You are totally mistaken and filled with disbelief.\" Afterward, he thought, \"In my dream, the one who was teaching dharma, Bharima who was listening to it, and all the other signs were indications that I should request the Jetsi.in's life story for the benefit of beings. Therefore I should request it by all means.\" He was filled with an extraordinary devotion to the lama and he prayed from the depths of his heart and the marrow of his bones. He rested in this state for a little while, and within an experience that was a mixture of dream state and luminosity, five beautiful maidens appeared, standing in"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"TSANGNY0N HERUKA a row before Rechungpa: white, blue, yellow, red, and green, wearing the ornaments and clothing of OQ.9iyana. One of them said, \"Milarepa's life story will be told tomor-row. Let us go and listen.\" Another asked, \"Who will request it?\" \"The senior heart-disciples will request it,\" responded an-other. All the while, they fluttered their eyes at Rechungpa. One of them said, \"Everyone would be delighted to hear such a marvelous teaching, so we should each offer a fervent prayer.\" Another said, \"It is proper for the senior disciples .to request the life story. It has instead fallen upon each of us to protect and propagate the master's teaching.\" Having said this, they vanished like a rainbow. Rechungpa then awoke from this state of luminosity. The dawn sun rose brilliantly in the sky. He reflected, \"I have under-stood the tidings of the five Sisters of Long Life.\" He prepared a meal while resting in a state of post-meditative experience. When he had eaten his fill, he went before the lama and found him surrounded by a resplendent, colorful assembly of resident disciples and lay followers. Rechungpa prostrated to the Jetsiin and inquired after his health. Then, kneeling before the Jetsiin with his palms joined, he made this supplication: \"Precious Jetsiin lama, buddhas of the past taught their inconceivable life stories consisting of twelve deeds and the like for the benefit of sentient beings. In this way, the teachings of the buddha spread throughout the world. And nowadays, fortunate trainees can be brought onto the path of ripening and liberation because lamas and adepts of the past such as Tilopa, Naropa, and Marpa have also taught their own life stories. Now, precious Jetsiin, in order to bring joy to your close disciples, to look after those who would become your trainees in the future, and most of all, to bring all living beings onto the path of ripening and lib-eration, precious Jetsiin I ask that, out of your great loving af-fection, you tell the story of your life and deeds, together with the origins of your family line.\" The great J etsiin replied with a smile on his face, \"Rechungpa, you already know me well, but since you ask I shall answer"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA your request. My clan is Khyungpo. My family. line is Josey. I am Milarepa. First I committed evil deeds. Later on I practiced virtue. Now I am free from both good and bad deeds, and hav-ing exhausted the bases for karmic activities, I will not conduct them in the future. Were I to explain these events at length, some would be reason for laughter, others would be reason for tears. Such discussions are of little use, so let this old man rest in peace.\" Rechungpa prostrated once again and then offered a suppli-cation: \"Precious Jetsiin, at first you practiced the profound oral instructions through asceticism and strong determina-tion. Devoting yourself to one-pointed practice, you have now brought to the surface the abiding nature of things and have brought phenomena to the point of extinction. In the future, you will neither carry out nor experience any karma that could fetter you. This is understood by everyone. Yet there is tremen-dous significance in the reasons why your clan is Khyungpo, why your familial line is Josey, and why you were given the name Mila, and also in the reasons why the manner in which you first committed evil deeds and you later practiced virtue are the causes for laughter and tears. Therefore I pray that you look upon myself and all beings without indifference in body, speech, and mind, but rather with great loving affection. In this way, then, please tell your story at length. You vajra brothers and sisters assembled here, and lay followers who have gath-ered out of faith, join in my prayer.\" After submitting this request, Rechungpa made many pros-trations. The great heart-disciples and faithful lay followers also made many prostrations and then offered the same supplication that the sublime individual Rechungpa had made, repeatedly requesting thattheir master. turn the wheel of dharma. Then the Jetsiin said: When you again ask with such urgency and insistence, I have no reason to keep it secret, so I shall tell you my story. My clan is Khyungpo, descended from a great band of nomads in the northern region of Dru. My family line stems from a lama who practiced Nyingma mantra, a yogin who was the son of a noble-man (josey). Favorably received by his chosen deity, he gained"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"16 TSANGNYON HERUKA power in the practice of incantation. He set out to make a pilgrimage throughout the countryside and to visit its sacred shrines. Reaching a place called Chungpachi in the region of Lato Jang in Tsang, he subjugated the harmful spirits in the area and offered his blessings. His effectiveness in performing such activities brought tremendous benefit to the region. His follow-ing and his activities thus increased. He was then given the name Khyungpo Josey and remained in the region for several years. Whatever calamities fell, due to illness, harmful spirits, and so forth, he was the individual who was called upon. Once there was a malicious demon that could not go near Josey but was insurmountably fearsome for everyone else. The demon de-scended upon a family that had very little faith in Josey, inflict-ing it with harm. The family called upon another lama, who performed a rite of wrathful subjugation and offered blessings, but they were of no use; the demon argued back, ridiculing and condemning the lama. At that point, unbeknownst to the demon, a relative of the faithless family advised them to in-vite Khyungpo Josey, stating, \"One uses even dog fat if it cures the wound. So call him!\" At this, the family invited Josey. He approached the demon and, drawing himself up, cried in a booming voice, \"1, Khyungpo Josey, am coming. I eat the flesh and drink the blood of demons and obstructing spirits, so just you wait.\" He sprang forth as he said this and even before he closed in, the demon was stricken with fear. Taken by surprise, it cried out again and again, \"0 mother, 0 father. Mila! Milaf\"4 Many such terrified expressions fell from its lips. · Josey approached the demon, who said, \"I have never both-ered you, so please spare my life.\" Josey made him swear never to harm anyone in the future and sent him away. The demon then reached a family that supported him and said, \"Mila! Mila! Never have I felt such agony and pain as I do now.\" \"Who brought this on?\" asked the family. \"Khyungpo Josey appeared. He threatened me with death and I accidentally pledged an oath,\" said the demon, and he went away. From then on, in order to express Josey's greatness and his fine qualities, everyone called him Josey Mila. His descendants"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA I7 therefore came to be known by the name Mila. Since the demon never harmed anyone again, everyone agreed that it must have passed on to another life. Khyungpo Josey then married a woman and had a son. This son had two sons, the elder of whom was known as Mila Doton Senge. To him was born a son named Mila Dorje Senge. From then on, his descendants each had only one son. Mila Dorje Senge was fond of playing the dice game sho, and as an expert gambler he raked in considerable winnings. At that time in the region there lived a man with many paternal relations who was a cheat and quite skilled at playing sho. In order to test Mila Dorje Senge, he played a game of sho, wagering a small sum. The man was thus able to size him up, and on that day he won effortlessly. Displeased, Mila Dorje Senge said he should be al-lowed to get even at dice the next morning. Wagering greater stakes than before, they cast the sho dice, and the man let him-self be beaten three times. Finally he said, \"I, too, should be allowed to get even.\" They agreed upon the size of the stakes and wagered their fields, their homes, and their personal wealth. They bound themselves by written contract so that there was no room for dispute and then they rolled the dice. The man won. His paternal relations seized control of Mila Dorje Senge's fields, home, and personal wealth. The two Milas, father and son, then set out from the region, leaving their home and everything they knew. They reached a place called Kyangatsa in Mangyul Gungtang, and then settled down. The father, Doton Senge, carried out village rituals for the local inhabitants such as reading and reciting scriptures, of-fering ritual cakes, providing protection from hailstorms, and performing rites for protecting children. His services, which were very much in demand, brought him many offerings. During winter the son Dorje Senge undertook major trading trips to gather goods from Nepal in the south. During summer he gath-ered goods from nomad lands in the north. He also engaged in minor trade, gathering goods throughout Mangyul Gungtang. In this way, the father and son accumulated a great deal of wealth. At that time, the son Dorje Senge loved a local maiden and"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"x8 TSANGNYON HERUKA the two married. To the couple was born a son who received the name Mila Sherab Gyaltsen. While they were raising him, his grandfather Doton Senge passed away, and they performed an extensive funeral. Afterward, Mila Dorje Senge increased his fortune through trade and became wealthier than ever be-fore. There was a man named Orma in the vicinity of Tsa who owned a fine, triangular field in Tsa. Dorje Senge purchased the field, paying out a good quantity of gold and merchandise from the north and south, and it came to be known as Orma Triangle. On the edge of the field lay ruins of an old lodging house be-longing to a neighbor. He bought that as well and laid the foundation work for a manor house. While the house was being raised, Mila Sherab Gyaltsen turned twenty. In a promi-nent family of Tsa, there was a beautiful young woman of the Nyang clan named Karmo Gyen. She was skilled in tending to worldly affairs, clearly loathing her enemies and loving her friends. Sherab Gyaltsen took her as a bride and she became known as Nyangtsa Kargyen. Construction on the manor house continued. On the third floor they built an open court, with a storage area and a kitchen off to the side. The house, which had four columns and eight beams and was one of the most pleasant homes in Kyangatsa, was known as Kazhi Dunggye (four columns eight beams). They lived there in happiness and developed a good reputation. Thereafter, some relations in Chung heard the reputation of the father and son, descendants of Mila Doton Senge. The son of Mila D\"orje Senge's paternal relative, Yungdrung Gyaltsen, then left his home together with his wife, children, and his sister Khyungtsa Paldren and went to Kyangatsa. Mila Dorje Senge had great affection for his relatives, so he was overjoyed attheir arrival and plied them with hospitality and gifts. He taught them how to undertake the business of commerce, and they too amassed a great deal of wealth through trade. Some time later on, Nyangtsa Kargyen became pregnant. Mila Sherab Gyaltsen, having brought numerous goods from the south, set out to sell them in the vicinity of Taktse in the north. A long time passed while he was away.

My mother dispatched a messenger to the place my father was staying, entrusting him with a letter that said, \"Here, at har-vest time, a son was bo~n to me. Come quickly to name him and to celebrate his naming feast.\" The messenger delivered the letter to my father and told him the story. Overjoyed, my father said, \"0 wonderful! I have already named my son. There has never been more than one son in each generation of my family line. As I am delighted to hear the news that the child has been born a son, I shall call him Topaga (Delightful to Hear). Now that my business is finished, I shall leave.\" Saying this, he returned home and gave me the name Topaga. My family held a fine naming feast and then I was raised with love. Later, whoever heard my pleasing voice was cheered up, so people said, \"That Topaga was aptly named.\" Then, when I turned four years old, my mother gave birth to a girl who was named Gonmokyi. Her nickname was Peta so she became known as Peta Gonkyi. I remember that we two, brother and sister, had dangling locks plaited with turquoise and gold. We held great authority and influence throughout the region, so the local nobility became aligned with our family and the peasants came into our service. While this pleased us, in secret the locals said, \"These foreigners are immigrants to our region, and there are none more brazen or wealthy. Their house and fields on the outside, their farm tools on the inside, and the ornaments worn by both men and women are all a sight to behold.\" With all his wishes fulfilled, Mila Dorje Senge died. His fu-neral rites were carried out on a grand scale. Thus Milarepa spoke. This was the first ordinary deed, the deed of his birth."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO Then Rechungpa asked, \"0 larria, after the loss of your father· long ago you encountered much hardship. Please tell us what that was like.\" Milarepa continued: When I was about seven years old, my father Mila Sherab Gyaltsen was stricken with a terrible illness. Doctors and divin-ers foretold that he would not recover and they abandoned him. Friends and relatives likewise knew he would not live. Even my father himself was resolved that he would not survive. Our rela-tives, including my paternal uncle and aunt, our friends, coun-trymen, and neighbors all gathered. My father intended to place his wife and children, together with all of his wealth, in the care of a trustee. At last he prepared an extensive testament ensuring that his son would reclaim his patrimony. Then he read it aloud for all to hear: \"I will say it in brief and out loud: I shall not recover from my present illness. Consequently, as my son is still young, these are the arrangements through which I entrust him to the care of all his relatives, especially his paternal uncle and aunt. My wealth includes all the following: in the highlands, yaks, horses, and sheep; in the lowlands, various tracts of land, Orma Triangle foremost among them, upon which the poor dare not even look; on the ground floor of the house, cattle, goats, and donkeys; in the upper rooms, utensils of gold, silver, and iron, turquoise, silk fabrics, and a granary. In short, my possessions are such that I need not aspire for any other man's wealth. \"Spend a. portion of these for expenses after I am gone. The rest I entrust to all of you gathered here until my son is able"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"22 TSANGNY6N HERUKA to support his own household. In particular, I entrust him to the care of both his paternal uncle and aunt. When my son is able to support his own family, he shall marry Dzese, as they were betrothed in childhood. You will then retur.n to him my wealth in its entirety and ensure that my son thus takes charge of his patrimony. Until then may all their relatives, led by their uncle and aunt, know the joys and sorrows of my wife and children. Do not lead them into misery. I shall watch you from my grave when I die.\" With this, my father died. Our relatives performed the rites for the deceased. In agreement they said, \"Nyangtsa Kargyen herself should take care of the remaining wealth, while we all should provide whatever assistance she needs as best we can from the side.\" My uncle and aunt said, \"Although some people are family, we are sincere family. We won't lead them, mother and children, into misery. In accordance with the testament, we shall assume control of the wealth.\" Without listening to the arguments of my mother's brother or Dzese's father and brothers, my uncle took the men's goods and my aunt took the women's; the rest they divided in half. Having done so, they said, \"You, mother and children, shall serve us each in turn.\" Thus my mother and we children no longer had control of our possessions. In summer, the time for working the fields, we were our un-cle's servants. In winter, the time for spinning and weaving wool, we were our aunt's servants. Our food was food for dogs, our work, work for donkeys. We wore strips of tattered robe over our shoulders, tied with a jute belt. Forced to toil without rest, our limbs became cracked and raw. With only poor food and clothing, we became pale and emaciated. Our hair, once dangling in locks plaited with gold and turquoise, turned ashen and thin and became infested with lice. Sensitive folks who saw or heard us all broke down in tears. Gossip quietly circulated about my aunt and uncle but they acted without restraint. As we, mother and children, were beset with misery, my mother said to my aunt, \"You are not Khyungtsa Paldren (Glorious Leader of the Khyung Tsa), you are Diimo Takdren (Demoness"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 23 Leader of Tigers).\" My aunt thus became known as Diimo Takdren. In those days there was a proverb: \"When the false master aims to be master, the true master is put out like a dog.\" Such is what had become of us, mother and children. Previously, when my father Mila Sherab Gyaltsen was alive, everyone, both high and low, looked to see if we smiled or frowned. Later, when my uncle and aunt became rich as kings, it was their faces, smiling or frowning, upon which everyone gazed. About my mother the people whispered, \"How true the saying, 'Rich husband, clever wife. Soft wool, fine woolens.' Now that no capable man is around, it is just as the proverb says. At first, while Nyangtsa Kargyen was sustained by a fine husband, it is said she was courageous and wise, and an excellent cook. Now her wisdom has dimmed and she is completely miserable.\" Our inferiors all ridiculed us behind our backs just as the saying goes: \"When one is beset by misery, gossip will follow in turn.\" Dzese's parents gave me new clothing and boots and said, \"When riches are gone, you needn't think yourself poor, since they are like dew drops in a meadow. In the past, your ances-tors didn't acquire wealth until later on in life. For you, too, a time of prosperity will come.\" Saying this they consoled us over and over. Then I reached my fifteenth year. At that time there was a field given to my mother by her parents as her inheritance, known by the unpleasant name Trepe Tenchungs (Little Boot Sole) but producing an excellent harvest. My maternal uncle cultivated the field and did what he could to increase its yield of barley while quietly stashing it away. With the excess he purchased a great quantity of meat, he ground a large amount of white barley into flour, and brewed a good deal of black barley into beer. This, he said, was for Nyangtsa Kargyen and her children to reclaim their wealth. Then we borrowed many carpets and laid them out in our house Kazhi Dunggye. We invited our close relatives, headed by my paternal aunt and uncle, our friends, countrymen, and neighbors, in particu-lar anyone with knowledge of my father Mila Sherab Gyaltsen's testament letter read at the time of his death. To my aunt and"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA uncle we presented an entire animal carcass. To the others we offered portions, larger or smaller, according to their rank. And with beer in porcelain cups for good fortune and long life, we served an excellent feast. My mother then stood up in the middle of the guests, who were seated in a row, and said, \"All right then. When a child is born, he is named. When beer is poured, there is talk. I also have a few words to say. Elders seated here in a row headed by uncle and aunt, you who know of my husband Mila Sherab Gyaltsen's testament proclaimed at the time of his passing, please listen closely.\" My maternal uncle then read the text of my father's testa-ment. When he finished, my mother said, \"Since the meaning of this text and its proclamation is clear to all the elders seated here, there is no need for me recount it at length. Briefly stated, up to now both uncle and aunt have looked after me and my children with utmost care. Now, as my son and Dzese are able to support their own family, I ask that you return our wealth that was entrusted to you, that my son marry Dzese, and that he then take possession of his patrimony in accordance with his father's testament.\" My uncle and aunt never agreed with one another, but they were reconciled in their greed, and I was an only son while my uncle had many sons. My uncle and aunt were thus united and said, \"You have possessions? Where are they? Previously, when Mila Sherab Gyaltsen was in good health we loaned him a house, fields, gold, turquoise, crossbred yaks, 6 horses, yaks, and sheep. When he died, these possessions were returned to their owner. Do you own a single piece of gold? A handful of barley? A single lump of butter? A single silken robe? Even a single she-goat? We never saw any of these. And yet you speak like this? Who wrote the text of your testament? We were good enough to sustain you truly miserable creatures so you did not starve to death. But it is as the saying goes: 'When wicked men are granted power, they will measure out water by the ladleful.'\" My uncle blew his nose and suddenly rose from his seat. He snapped his fingers, shook the hem of his cloak, and stomped his foot. Then he said, \"What is more, even this house belongs"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA to us, so you and your children, get out!\" and he slapped my mother with his hand and struck my sister and me with the length of his sleeve. At that point my mother cried, \"0 father Mila Sherab Gyaltsen, look at the fate of your wife and children. You who said, 'I shall watch you from my grave,' the time has come to look upon us.\" She fell on the floor weeping and rolled back and forth on the ground. My sister and I could do nothing for her but weep. Since my uncle had many sons, my mother's brother was unable to stand up to them. Those of our countrymen who were sympathetic toward us expressed their empathy for mother and children, and not one among them failed to weep. The rest sighed deeply. Then uncle and aunt said to us, \"You say that you need your possessions but you already possess many things. You have laid out a feast for your neighbors and countrymen without regard for the meat and beer that you squandered. Your pos-sessions? We don't have them. Even if we did, we wouldn't give them to you. So if you are many wage war, if you are few cast magic.\" Having said this, they left. Those who sided with them followed them out. As my mother sat there weeping hysterically, all those sym-pathetic to us, such as my maternal uncle and Dzese's father and brothers, stayed behind to console her. They drank the re-maining beer and said to my mother, \"Don't cry. Crying won't help. Beg something from everyone who gathered here today at the feast tables. All of us here will give what we can. Even Uncle and Aunt will give something.\" My maternal uncle said, \"Do just that, and send the boy to learn a skill. You and your daughter come stay with me and work the fields. It is fitting that you do something useful. In any case, you must not be shamed before Uncle and Aunt.\" My mother replied, \"I have no control over our possessions. But I will not support my children with charity. Uncle and Aunt have no intention to return even a portion of our wealth. I will by all means send my son to learn a skill. Uncle and Aunt did not return to us what was rightfully ours, so we will run at the sound of the drum and run at the rising of smbke.7 Then they"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"26 TSANGNYON HERUKA will see what we are really like. From here on, we will work the fields.\" In Mithogeka of Tsa there lived a master of the Nyingmapa mantra tradition named Lugye Khen, who was very much in demand for village rituals. I was sent to study reading with him. At that time, our relatives gave us a few things they had begged. In particular, Dzese's parents gave foodstuffs and fire-wood and then repeatedly sent Dzese to the place where I was learning to read in order to console me. My maternal uncle fed my mother and sister so they were not forced to go beg or work for others. My maternal uncle wouldn't let my mother beg, keeping her continuously engaged so that wool she spun on one day was that day woven. In this way my sister and I accu-mulated whatever useful things and money we could. My sister worked in the service of others as much as possible, and, run-ning at the sound of the drum and running at the rising of smoke, she was able to obtain some clothes. With flavorless food, tattered clothing, and miserable spirits, we did not know any happiness. Thus Milarepa spoke. At this point, those listening to the discourse felt saddened and world-weary.

The alcohol was plenti-ful and people from every direction served the master beer. Drinking everything that was offered, he became drunk. The master handed over the gifts he had received and sent me on ahead. I was also drunk on beer, and as I had been captivated by singers earlier in the day, I too felt a desire to sing. I had a good voice, so I walked along singing. The path passed in front of my house and I was still singing when I reached my door. My mother was inside roasting barley and heard me. \"What is this?\" she wondered. \"This voice sounds like my son's. But no-where on earth is there anyone more miserable than me and my children, so how could he be singing?\" Not believing what she heard, she came to look. She recog-nized me and, in her astonishment, cast away the tongs in her right hand and the barley whisk in her left, leaving the roasting barley to burn.

While she lay there collapsed, my sister came over and said, \"Elder brother, what were you thinking? Look at mother.\" She wept, and as she did I realized that they were right. Then I too shed many tears. My sister and I rubbed my mother's hand and called to her as we cried. After a while, she regained conscious-ness and got up. Then she stared at me with her tearstained face and said, \"Boy, can you really think about singing songs when nowhere on earth is there anyone more miserable than us, mother and children? When I think about it, I, your old mother, feel despair and all I can do is cry.\" The three of us, mother and children, wailed our lament and sobbed. To my mother I said, \"Mother, you are right. Do not be so distressed. I shall do whatever you wish.\" My mother replied, \"I would like to see you draped in a fine cloak and mounted upon a horse with your stirrups slashing the throats of our hated enemies. Such will not come to pass; yet success is still possible by means of treachery. So I would like you to train to become an expert in black magic, curses, and casting hail. Then you should destroy all those who in-flicted misery on us, villagers and countrymen beginning with your uncle and aunt, cutting off their family lines for nine gen-erations. See if you can do that.\" · \"I will see if I am able, mother. Prepare offerings for the lama and provisions for me, whatever you have.\" So that I might train in black magic, my mother sold half of the field Trepe Tenchung in return for a turquoise called Karchen Otro (Great Radiant Star) and a white horse called Senge Sabme (Unbridled Lion) beloved in the region. She also obtained two bundles of dye and two packs of dried molasses, of which the two packs of dried molasses were used for our immediate needs. With this, my preparations were completed. I rested a few days at a place called Lhundrup Guesthouse in Gungtang where I looked for traveling companions. Five ami-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA able young men arrived. They said they were from Ngari Dol and announced that they were going to D Tsang in order to study dharma and black magic. I suggested that we travel to-gether since I was also going to study magic. They agreed, and I led them to Lower Gungtang where I looked after them for a few days. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to me, my mother said to them, \"This son of mine has no perseverance whatsoever. As his com-panions, you should encourage him and ensure that he becomes thoroughly skilled in black magic. When you return here, I will show my hospitality and offer you a generous reward.\" Then, with the two bundles of dye loaded on the horse and the turquoise tucked away on my person, we set out. My mother accompanied us for a long while and when we stopped to drink the barley beer she carried, she offered my companions much advice. At last she pulled me aside and grasped my hand over and over, unable to bear the thought of parting from her only son. With her face tearstained and her voice choked with sobs, she said, \"Son, remember our misfortunes. You must do what-ever you can to show signs of black magic in our region. The black magic of your companions and our magic are not the same. Theirs is black magic for the pleasure of fine young men. Ours is black magic for a desperate family. That is why you must persevere. Son, if you return without showing signs of black magic in our region, I, your old mother, will kill myself right in front of you.\" I promised, and then we parted ways. Feeling a powerful longing for my mother, I looked back at her again and again and shed many tears. My mother also felt a strong attachment for me, her only son, and stayed there watching me with tears in her eyes for as long as I remained in sight. I had the heartrending thought, \"Should I turn back, should I turn around and see my mother for just a moment?\" I felt that mother and son would not meet again. Then, when we were out of sight, my mother returned home weeping. After a few days, rumor spread widely that Nyangtsa Kargyen's son had gone off to train in black magic. We took the road to D Tsang and reached Yakde in Tsangrong. There I sold my horse and dye to a very wealthy man and the gold I received"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"30 TSANGNYON HERUKA as payment I carried on my person. After crossing the Tsangpo, we turned toward D and at Tonluk Raka encountered many monks and nuns from D. We asked them for the name of a mas-ter in the region of 0 skilled in black magic, curses, and casting hail. One of the monks said, \"In the village of Kyorpo in Yarlung lives a lama named Yungton Trogyal of Nyak. He is an accom-plished master of wrathful mantra practices such as black magic and curses.\" The monk was his disciple. So then, setting out to meet lama Yungton Trogyal, we reached the village of Kyorpo in Yarlung. When we met the lama, my companions presented only trifling gifts, but I offered every-thing, gold and turquoise. I said, \"I further offer my body, speech, and mind. There are some people who live nearby in my region who envy my happiness. Have pity and give me your most potent black magic, one that will show signs of working in my region. Until then, out of compassion, please give me food and clothing.\" The lama smiled and replied, \"I shall think over what you have said.\" But from that point on he did not teach us the deepest black magic. Rather, he gave us a few evil mantras that he claimed would make heaven and earth tremble and clash, as well as a few useful instructions together with their ritual practices. About a year passed in this way, and as my companions were all preparing to leave, the lama offered them each a fine cloak he had sewn from woolen cloth of central Tibet. But I was not convinced. I thought it would be difficult for the black magic I had learned to show signs of working in my region. And my mother would surely kill herself were I to return home without showing signs of magic. Thus I did not prepare to leave. My companions said, \"Topaga, are you not going?\" \"I have not yet learned enough black magic to leave.\" . They replied, \"These instructions are all most profound if we are able to practice them effectively enough. The lama him-self has said that he possesses nothing more. We no longer doubt his black magic. Yougo see if he will give you anything else.\" They offered their thanks and made prostrations to the lama, and then they left. I too put on the cloak given by the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA lama and accompanied them until they took their meal. We bid each other good health and then they set out for their home-land. On the way back to the lama, I gathered horse and don-key manure, cow dung, and dog droppings, filling the bottom of my cloak. I dug a hole in a fertile field owned by the lama and buried them inside. The lama, who was on the roof of his house, saw me and re-marked to several of his monks, \"Of all the disciples I have had in the past, there has never been, nor will there be, one more good-natured than him down there. A sign of this is that he did not come to wish me farewell this morning and yet he returned. When he first arrived at my home he requested black magic because, as he put it, 'There are people living in my region who envy my happiness.' He said, 'I offer my body, speech, and mind.' If the story of such a simple fellow is true, it would be a pity were I not to grant him black magic.\" One of the monks repeated this to me and I joyfully thought, \"I will finally get the black magic that's been withheld from me.\" I then went to see the lama, who asked, \"Topaga, why did you not return home?\" As a gift, I offered the cloak that the lama had presented to me. I made prostrations and touched his feet to my head. Having done so, I said, \"Precious lama, there are three of us, my mother, my sister, and me. Some of our neighbors and countrymen, led by my uncle and aunt, have risen up as enemies and tormented us with all manner of cruelty. Powerless to retaliate against them, my mother sent me to train in black magic. If I return home without showing signs of black magic, my mother will kill herself in front of me. That is why I did not leave, and that is why I am requesting that you grant me the deepest black magic.\" I made this appeal and I wept. \"How have your countrymen tormented you?\" asked -the lama. Sobbing, I described at length about how my father Mila Sherab Gyaltsen died and about the ways in which my uncle and aunt then tormented us.

Yet no one but you has said that he offers his body, speech, and mind. I will quickly verify your story.\" At the time, the lama had a monk who was swifter than a horse and stronger than an elephant sent to my home to look things over. He quickly returned and said, \"Precious lama, Topaga has told the truth, so you should really teach him magic.\" The lama said to me, \"If I had rushed to give you black magic right away, I feared that a simple fellow such as you would have made me regret it. Since you have told the truth, you will now be granted black magic, but you must go to another master to study it.

In the region called Nup Khulung in Tsangrong lives the Khulungpa lama named Yonten Gyatso, knowledgeable in both medicine and mantra, and I gave this practice to him. He possesses the practice of casting hailstorms by pointing one's finger, which he gave to me. As we then became close friends, those who come to me to study black magic I send to him and those who go to him to study hail casting he sends to me. For this reason, I will also send you to him together with my son.\" He provided me and his elder son named Darma Wangchuk with a crossbred yak loaded with thick wool and blended flan-nel from D province together with a small gift and sealed letter. Having then reached Nup Khulung in Tsangrong, we met lama Nubchungwa Yonten Gyatso and offered him the woolens along with the gift and letter from the lama. Explaining the circumstances of my situation in detail, I requested that he agree to teach me black magic."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 33 The lama said, \"The lama has been my friend-for a long time and is true to his word. I shall certainly teach you two the in-structions for black magic. On that mountain spur down there, construct a retreat cell where you will not be disturbed by human hands.\" The cell had three stories below and one story above in which we placed sturdy beams, aligned side by side like rows of fish. We secured the perimeter with boulders nearly the size of yaks, leaving no gaps between them. We thus made there-treat cell so that others could neither discover its door nor find a way to infiltrate its walls. The master then gave instructions on black magic. We practiced the magic and seven days passed. The lama came and said, \"In the past, seven days were suffi-cient. That should be enough this time too.\" I replied, \"Since this is black magic cast from a great dis-tance, I ask that we continue for another seven days.\" \"In that case,\" he said, \"continue to practice.\" On the evening of the fourteenth day, the lama returned and said, \"Tonight, signs of black magic will appear at the edge of the mandala.\" That night, oath-bound protectors of the teach-ings appeared carrying thirty-five human heads and hearts, covered in blood. They said, \"For some days, you have called upon us and this is just what you have asked for,\" and they piled the heads and hearts at the edge of the mandala. In the morning, the lama returned and said, \"There remain two people to be liberated. Should they be killed or spared?\" \"Spare them,\" I replied, \"in order to make known my satis-faction and justice.\" They were left alone, and thus my uncle and aunt were spared. We offered ritual cakes and a thanksgiv-ing feast to the oath-bound dharma protectors and then left the retreat. Remains of the retreat cell are still present in Khulung. Meanwhile, I wondered how signs of black magic had mani-fested in my homeland of Kyangatsa. There had been a wedding feast for my uncle's elder son to receive his bride. Thirty-five people who despised us gathered in the house, led by my uncle's sons and their wives. Other guests and those partial to us talked among themselves on the way to the house. They said, \"As the saying goes, 'When the false master aims to be master, the mas-"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"34 TSANGNYON HERUKA ter is put out like a dog,' so too have these terrible people acted. If the power of Topaga's incantation does not work against them, the power of the truth of the Precious Jewels will.\" Those who were coming to the gathering had not yet entered the house, and my uncle and aunt stood outside discussing what food to offer and what greeting to pay to each person. At that moment, a former servant of mine who now worked for my uncle went to draw water. She did not see the many horses tethered in the courtyard, but instead saw it filled with scorpi-ons, spiders, snakes, tadpoles, and the like. In their midst stood a scorpion as big as a yak, thrusting its claws around a pillar and tearing it out. She fled in terror, and just as she landed out-side, the many stallions that were tethered together with the mares riled the females, causing alL the horses to startle and rear, while the mares kicked at the stallions. Pillars were struck and they toppled. The house collapsed, and under the rubble some thirty-five people died, including my uncle's sons and their wives. The house was filled with corpses and shrouded in a swirl of dust. Seeing the calamity that filled the area outside, Peta rushed to my mother and gave an account, saying, \"Mother! Mother! Uncle's house has collapsed and many people have died. Come look.\" My mother wondered whether it was true or not and, over-whelmed with joy, she went to look. Upon seeing my uncle's house reduced to a swirling cloud of dust and hearing the val-ley filled with mournful cries, she was as happy as she was as-tonished. Right then, my mother fastened a tattered rag to the end of a long stick and holding it aloft she cried in a loud voice, \"I present this before you, please accept it, gods, lamas; and the Triple Gem.

Some said, \"She's right!\" Others said, \"She's right, but she is overdoing it now.\" All those who had relatives die in the ca-lamity heard my mother. Gathering together, they said, \"It's not enough that she caused this disaster! Now she gloats! How despicable! Torture her and rip out her beating heart.\" The elders said, \"What is the use of killing her? It is her boy who has brought this upon us. Indeed it was him alone. Therefore, first find her boy and kill him with your own hands however you can. Then it will be easy to kill her.\" They agreed upon this. My uncle heard this and said, \"Now I have neither sons nor daughters left to lose. Me, I will be happy if I die.\" He set off to kill my mother, but my ·countrymen held him back, saying, \"First of all, it is because you did not keep your word that this calamity has befallen the region. And now, if you carry out your plan without killing her boy, we will oppose you.\" Thus my uncle was left without a chance to act. My countrymen then conspired to set out and kill me. My maternal uncle went to my mother and said, \"With your speech yesterday and the way you acted, our countrymen are waiting to kill you and your son with their own hands. What did you hope to achieve? You should have been satisfied that the black magic worked.\" In this way, he scolded her at length . . My mother replied, \"These things didn't happen to you, brother! I agree with what you are saying, but it's difficult to show restraint when all my wealth has been stolen in this way.\" And without saying another word, she broke down in tears. Her brother continued, \"It's true. You are right. But now I'm worried that people will come to kill you, so lock yourself be-hind closed doors.\" After he left, she barred the doors and thought things over for a long while.

At that moment, a yogin from the region of 0 who was returning from a pilgrimage to Nepal showed up, begging for alms. My mother asked him his story in detail and determined he would make a suitable messenger. \"Rest here a few days,\" she said. \"I have a son in the region of 0 Tsang and I have some news to send him. Please help to deliver it.\" During that time she made him feel comfortable with kind hospitality. My mother then lit a butter lamp and made the following prayer: \"If my wishes will be fulfilled,.may the butter lamp remain lit for a long time. But if they will not be fulfilled may the lamp quickly die out. May Topaga's lama and the dharma protectors make it so.\" -The lamp lasted a whole day and night, so my mother be-lieved her wishes would be fulfilled. She said, \"Yogin, clothing and shoes are essential for traveling across the country, so you'll need patches and shoe leather.\" She gave him leather strips for his boots, and she herself patched the worn cloak that he wore. Unbeknownst to the yogin, she hid the seven ounces of gold inside the back of the cloak, over which she placed a square patch of black cloth. She secured it by embroi-dering stars of coarse white thread in the center, resembling the form of the constellation Pleiades, which could not be seen from the outside. She further offered the yogin a handsome gift and gave him a sealed letter written in code. Then she sent him off. Afterward, my mother thought, \"Since I do not know what my countrymen have conspired to do, I should adopt a menac-ing air.\" She then instructed Peta, \"Inform everyone that your brother has given a letter to the yogin who was here yesterday.\""},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 37 My mother wrote and sealed a letter to look-like it had been sent by me. It said: Mother and sister, I trust you are well and that you have witnessed signs of black magic. If any of our countrymen in particular treat you with hostility, send me a letter with their family names. Using the black arts, it is easier to snuff out a man's life than it is to offer a pinch of food, so I can cut off their family line for nine generations. If the entire countryside acts with hostility, you, mother and sister, should leave and come here and I will destroy the region without leaving a trace. I have not been hindered in my practice for lack of resources or provisions, so do not worry about me. She first showed the letter to my maternal uncle and friends of the family. Then she left it in her brother's hands so that ev-eryone would see it. As a result, they talked it over and aban-doned their plan to kill her. Then they took the field Orma Triangle from my paternal uncle and returned it to my mother. Meanwhile, the yogin came looking for me. He heard that I was in Nup Khulung and then found me there. He reported in detail the events that had transpired in my region concerning my mother, my sister, and so forth. Then he turned over the letter and I read it off to one side.

With my provisions at an end, I would soon be destitute, but I was unfamiliar with that region or those relations so I broke down in tears. I asked the yogin, \"You know the region where my relatives live. Where is it?\" \"It is Ngari Gungtang,\" he replied. \"Don't you know any others? Where is your homeland?\" \"I know many other regions, but I do not know any where your relatives live. I am from 0.\" \"Well then, stay here a bit.

I asked the yogin but he doesn't know either.\" The lama's wife, who possessed the marks of a wisdom qakin'i, read the letter once aloud and then said, \"Call the yogin inside.\" I called him and she then lit a large fire. Serving him some delicious beer, she had the cloak removed from the yogin's back. The lama's wife put it on and pranced back and forth saying, \"What fun it would be to wear such a cloak and travel around the countryside.\" Then, having slipped up to the roof, the lama's wife removed the gold from inside the cloak.,·She resewed the patch as before and draped the cloak over the yogin. After serving him the evening meal, she took him to other quarters. Then the lama's wife said, \"Tell Topaga to come here before the lama.\" When I arrived, she handed over the seven ounces of gold. \"Where did the gold come from?\" I asked. \"It was inside the yogin's cloak,\" she replied. \"Topaga has quite a clever mother.

Afterward, I gave one-tenth of an ounce of gold to the yogin, which pleased him.9 I offered seven-tenths of an ounce of gold to the lady. Then I offered three ounces of gold to the lama and said to him, \"Now, my old mother says that she needs a hail-storm. So please think kindly of me and give me the instruc-tions for casting hail.\" He replied, \"If you need hail, go see Yungton Trogyal.\" The lama gave me a letter together with some gifts, and once again I went to the village of Kyorpo in Yarlung.

Now, in addition, I received a letter saying that I need to cast hailstorms, so please think kindly of me.\" \"So be it,\" said the lama. He gave me the instructions and I went to practice them in my old retreat cell. After seven days, a cloud gathered inside the magical pit, lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled. Thus I thought I could direct a hailstorm by pointing my finger. · The lama repeatedly asked me, \"Since you are casting a hail-storm, how high are the crops now in your region?\" I replied first, \"They have just barely sprouted,\" and then some time later, \"The seedlings are just high enough to hide the pigeons.\" \"It is a little too early,\" said the lama.

He sent the messenger who had already been to my vil-lage as my companion, and disguised as yogins we set off. In my region the elders could not remember having had such a good year, and a law was established forbidding people from harvesting the crops whenever they pleased. When we arrived, the harvest was due to be reaped the next day and the day after. I prepared for the practice in the upper end of the valley. Then I repeated the mantras and a cloud gathered, barely the size of a small bird. This was not what I had hoped for. So I invoked the names of the oath-bound protectors and proclaimed the truth of how my countrymen had abused me. I pounded my cloak and shed many tears. Then suddenly a black cloud, un-imaginably vast, gathered in the sky. It converged into a sin-gle mass and at that instant hailstones beat down upon the grain, covering the entire valley three bricks deep. The whole mountainside was washed into ravines. Seeing the loss of their harvest, the villagers wept. Afterward, a tremendous rainstorm set in. As my companion and I were chilled, we lit a fire of tamarisk wood in a cave whose entrance faced north, and there we stayed. Some locals, who had gone hunting for the harvest thanks-giving, said, \"This Topaga has wreaked suffering upon our countrymen as no one else ever has. He has already slain so many men. Now he has wiped out this year's excellent crops. If he fell into our hands, we would rip out his still-beating heart, and each of us would take a bit of flesh and a drop of blood. But even this would not relieve the pain we feel in our hearts.\" As they were saying this, they passed in front of our cave on their way down the mountain. An old man said, \"Silence! Silence! Speak softly. There is smoke in that cave over there and we don't know who it is.\" The younger men said, \"It must be Topaga. He hasn't seen us so we should call together a gang from the village. If we don't kill him, he will bring still further ruin to the region.\" With this, they turned back. My companion said, \"You go on ahead. I'll pretend that I"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 41 am you and that I have come to gloat over their misfortune.\" We agreed to meet at the inn of Dingri on the fourth night. He was conscious of his own great strength and remained there without fear. At that moment I dreamed of seeing my mother one more time, but frightened by my enemies, I quickly fled. As I skirted the village of Nyanam, a dog bit my leg and I did not arrive at our meeting place on time. My companion was surrounded by the gang of villagers but broke through their circle and escaped. He raced when they were at his heels. When they lagged behind he slowed down. They flung weapons at him and each time he hurled large stones in return. As he ran away, he shouted at them, \"I will curse anyone who ventures against me. Did I not gloat over all the men I have already slain? I wiped out this year's excellent crops. Shall I not gloat over that too? So if you do not treat my mother and sister well, I will curse the highlands of this valley and annihilate its lowlands. Those who are not killed will have their family lines severed for nine generations. If you do not see this region laid waste with death and destruction, it will be no fault of mine. Just wait! Just wait!\" Frightened at this, the men of the gang quarreled among themselves, saying, \"Do something back! Do something!.\" With that, they agreed they should return. My companion reached Dingri ahead of me and asked the innkeeper if a yogin such as himself had arrived. The innkeeper replied, \"He has not, but you so-called yogins are very fond of drink. There is a drinking festival over in the next village. Go there. If you have no cup, I can lend you one.\" The yogin bor-rowed a cup, deep-bottomed and ashen like the face of Shinje, the Lord of Death, and carried it to the festival grounds where I was seated at the end of a row of guests. He came up beside me and asked, \"Why didn't you meet me yesterday?\" \"Yesterday I went to beg and a dog bit my leg so I couldn't travel quickly. But it's nothing to worry about.\" We set out together and when we reached Kyorpo in Yarlung rhc lama said, \"You two have indeed met with great success.\" \"No one has been here before us. Who did you hear it from?\" we asked."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA \"The faces of the oath-bound protectors appeared, their faces shining like the full moon. I have also presented them the thanksgiving rites.\" The lama seemed very pleased as he said this. This is the way I accumulated negative karma by plotting to destroy my enemies. Thus Milarepa spoke. This was the third ordinary deed, the deed in which he annihi-lated his enemies. These three chapters constitute Milarepa's ordinary worldly deeds."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"PART II"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR Part two consists of Milarepa's nine supreme deeds leading to transcendence and peace. The first deed: on account of his world-weariness and ·renunciation, he sought out a qualified lama. The second deed: he met his lama and, submitting to his every command, purified evil deeds and obscurations, excluding ·none, through insufferable and exhausting hardships. The third deed: he was accepted by his lama with affection and received the ripening and liberating instructions. The fourth deed: medi-tating on reality in the lama's presence, the sprouts of experience and realization emerged. The fifth deed: he mastered the gen-eral instructions and then, compelled by symbolic acts within a dream, he obtained tantric instructions and departed from the lama. The sixth deed: he vowed to practice having been reminded once again of the essencelessness of life's round. The seventh deed: in order to practice the lama's teachings, \"he renounced his present life and meditated undistracted in the mountains with perseverance and through severe austerity. The eighth deed: med-itating in that manner, his experience and realization were per-fected, and through the results of his practice he benefited both the teachings and sentient beings. The ninth deed: he completed the activities of an enlightened being and, in order to compel be-ings to practice dharma, he dissolved his form body into the sphere of reality. Here is the first of these. Once again Rechungpa asked, \"Revered lama, you said that you performed virtuous actions, which must refer to those of authentic dharma. What were the circumstances through which the Jetsiin encountered the dharma?\""},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"TSANGNY6N HERUKA The Jetsiin replied: I felt remorse for the evils I had committed through casting black magic and hailstorms. I thought about dharma so in-tensely that during the day I forgot to eat. If I went out, I wanted to stay in. If I stayed in, I wanted to go out. At night I was so filled with world-weariness and renunciation that I was un-able to sleep. Yet I could not confess my desire to seek out the dharma. While I continued to serve the lama, I constantly ago-nized about how I might practice dharma. At that time, the lama had a faithful and devoted patron who amassed great wealth and so was able to provide whatever was needed. This patron was stricken with a terrible illness, and the lama was the first to be called upon to look after him. Three days passed and the lama returned, his face dark and sullen. \"Venerable lama, why do you seem so uneasy?\" I asked. He replied, \"All composite things are impermanent. Last night my fine patron died, so I am saddened by life's round. More im-portantly, I am an old man and from the white teeth of my youth to the white hair of my old age I have: focused my actions on destruction through black magic, curses, and hailstorms. Son, from a young age you too have accumulated terrible evil deeds by casting magic and hailstorms. All those will come to weigh upon me as well.\" \"Has the lama not led those beings to higher rebirth and liberation?\" I asked. The lama replied, \"I understand that the nature of beings is reality itself and I know in theory how to lead them to higher rebirth and liberation. I also know a ritual or two for doing that, but I have only words and rote knowledge, so when the time comes to perform them I have no confidence that they will work. Now I am going to practice dharma so I can endure whatever difficulties arise. You stay here to look after my dis-ciples and I will take up the path for your higher rebirth and liberation. Or else, you practice dharma and take up the path for my higher rebirth and liberation. I will provide you with the necessary provisions.\" In this way, my wish was fulfilled and I requested permission to practice dharma myself."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 47 \"In that case,\" said the lama, \"since you are young and show great perseverance and faith, you must practice perfectly pure dharma.\" He gave me a crossbred yak together with a load of woolen cloth from Yarlung. Then he said, \"In the place called Nar in Tsangrong lives lama Rongton Lhaga who has become a scholar and adept of the authentic dharma called Great Perfection. Go there and practice in a genuine way.\" In accordance with the lama's prophetic advice, I went to Nar in Tsangrong and made inquiries. The lama's wife and sev-eral monks in residence said, \"This is the main monastery and the lama isn't here at present. He is staying at a branch monas-tery in the place called Nyangto Rinang.\" \"Well, in that case,\" I replied, \"I was sent here by lama Yungton Trogyal, so please help me meet with your master.\" Then I told them my story at length and the lama's wife dis-patched a monk as my guide. Finally, I met the lama at Nyangto Rinang. I presented him offerings of the woolen cloth and the crossbred yak. I then told him I was a terrible sinner who had come from Nyima Lato, and requested a dharma teaching that brings about liberation in this lifetime. The lama replied, \"This authentic dharma of mine, the Great Perfection, is victorious in the spreading of its roots, victorious in the achievement of its canopy, and victorious in the fruit it bears. Meditate by day and become a buddha by day. Meditate by night and become a buddha by night. Fortunate beings whose past actions have created favorable circumstances do not even need to meditate, they are liberated by simply hearing it. Since it is a dharma teaching for those with superior faculties, I shall grant it.\" The lama gave the initiations and instructions, and I thought, \"When I first practiced magic, substantial signs of success ap-peared in fourteen days. Seven days were enough for hail. Now here is a teaching even easier than magic or hail. Meditating by day, you become a buddha by day. Meditating by night, you become a buddha by night. And if you are a fortunate person whose past actions have created favorable circumstances, you"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"TSANGNY6N HERUKA don't even need to meditate. To encounter such a tradition, I too must be one of those people with favorable circumstances.\" Filled with pride in this way, I stayed in bed without meditat-ing, and in this way the man and the teaching parted ways. When several days had passed the lama said, \"It is true what you said, you are a great sinner who has come from Lato. I have boasted about my teaching a little too much, and so I have not been able to guide you. Now, in the remote hermitage called Drowolung in Lhodrak there lives a direct disciple of the great Indian adept Naropa. He is a supreme master, the king of trans-lators named Marpa Lotsawa, an adept of the New Mantra Tradition without rival throughout the three realms. Since you have a karmic link with him from previous lives, go see him.\" Simply hearing the name of Marpa the Translator I was filled with an indescribable happiness, every hair on my body quiv-ered with joy, and I sobbed with boundless devotion. I focused my mind one-pointedly and set out carrying provisions and a volume of scripture. As I went along I thought, \"When, 0 when will I meet the lama and see his face?\" and I was not hampered by any other considerations. The night before my arrival in Drowolung, PaJ].chen Naropa appeared to Marpa in a dream and granted initiation. To Marpa he gave a slightly soiled five-pronged vajra made from lapis lazuli and a golden vase filled with nectar. Then he said, \"Using water from the vase, clean.se the tarnish from this vajra and then mount it atop a victory banner. This will please the Victors of the past and make sentient beings happy, thus benefiting your-self and others.\" With this, Naropa vanished into space. In accordance with the lama's instructions, he washed the vajra with water from the vase and then mounted it atop a vic-tory banner. Light from the vajra permeated the entire universe. As this light struck beings throughout the six realms, they were filled with a happiness devoid of suffering. In such a state they bowed down before Marpa and the victory banner and presented them offerings. The Victors then consecrated the banner. Marpa awoke from the dream with a slight feeling of pride. He was delighted and joyful, and at that moment his wife en-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 49 tered to serve his morning meal. She said, \"0 lama, last night I dreamt that two women, who said they were from Oq<;liyana in the north, appeared carrying a crystal stupa, slightly soiled on the outside. They said, 'It is lama Naropa's command to mas-ter Marpa that the master consecrate this stupa and place it on the summit of a mountain.' You, master, replied, 'Pal}chen Naropa has already consecrated this stupa, but I must obey his command.' You then performed extensive consecration rites, washing the stupa with water from the vase and so forth. You then placed it on a mountaintop where it radiated light as daz-zling as the sun and moon and replicated numerous copies of itself on the tops of neighboring mountains. The two women served as stewards for them all. Such was my dream. What does it mean?\" Although Marpa thought that these dreams were in accord and was elated, he said to his wife, \"Since dreams come out of nowhere I do not know their meaning. I am going to plow the field along the path down there. Prepare what I need.\" \"But you have so many laborers,\" she replied. \"If you, a great lama, undertake such work, everyone will ridicule us. So I beg you, stay at home.\" The lama ignored her words, demanding, \"Bring me plenty of beer.\" When she brought him a full jar of beer he said, \"I will drink this. Bring more beer for a guest.\" She brought another full jar of beer, which he buried in the ground and covered with his hat. While he plowed he drank the beer and waited. Meanwhile, beginning in the lower end of Lhodrak I asked everyone I met where the most excellent Marpa Lotsawa lived, but I did not come upon a single person who knew of him. When I reached the pass from which I could see Drowolung, a man appeared and I questioned him as I had the others. \"There is a man named Marpa, but no one called· the most excellent Marpa Lotsawa,\" he replied. \"Well then, where is Drowolung?\" I asked. \"Drowolung is over there,\" he said, pointing it out. \"Who lives over there?\" \"That very man named Marpa.\""},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"so \"And he has no other name?\" \"Some also call him lama Marpa.\" TSANGNYON HERUKA Concluding that this was the lama's residence, I asked, \"What is this pass called?\" \"The pass is called Cholagang (Pass of Dharma).\" I joyfully thought that to see my lama's residence from the Pass of Dharma was a very auspicious omen. Then I pressed on, continuing my inquiries. I came upon a number of cow-herds and I asked them. The elder ones said they did not know of him, but one--a handsome youth wearing fine ornaments, well spoken, and his hair oiled and neatly combed-replied, \"Do you speak of my father? If so, my father bought gold with all our wealth and took it to India. He returned carrying many gem-studded volumes of scripture as gifts. He never worked in the past, but today father is plowing his field.\" I considered this and thought, \"It sounds like him, but such a great translator would not likely be plowing his field.\" And I continued on my way. Along the road a heavyset cleric with a stocky frame, wide.:.set eyes, and a resplendent air was plowing a field. The instant I saw him I was overcome with a feeling of inconceivable and inexpressible happiness in which the flicker-ing perceptions of this life suddenly came to a halt. I remained there for a moment and then said, \"It is said that the translator Marpa Lotsawa, a direct disciple of glorious Naropa, dwells in this area. Where does he live?\" For a long while, the cleric looked me over from head to toe. Then he asked, \"Where are you from? What is your business?\" I replied, \"I am a terrible sinner from the region of Lato in Tsang. Since he is so greatly renowned, I have come to request the genuine dharma.\" · \"Very well then,\" he said. \"I will introduce you to Marpa. But meanwhile, plow this field of mine.\" From under his hat he took out the beer he had buried in the ground and gave it to me. It was refreshing and delicious. The cleric went off saying I should work hard to plow the field. I drank the remaining beer and then plowed with determination. After a while, the youth I had spoken with among the cow-"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA herds came to call me. \"The lama says that you ·should come home to meet him,\" he reported, and I was overjoyed. \"The cleric has arranged an introduction for me,\" I replied, \"so I will plow the remainder of his field.\" Thus I turned over the little bit of ground that remained. Since that field served as the favorable circumstance for me to meet the lama, I called it Tiinkyen (Favorable Circumstance). In summer, a footpath runs along its edge, but it runs through the middle in winter. I joined the youth and went to the lama's home. The cleric I had met previously sat upon a carpet, raised high with two cushions and a woolen rug, and a pillow at his back. He had wiped himself off, but his brow, his nostrils, his moustache, and his goatee had not come clean. He sat there in a relaxed manner, waiting for his meal. I thought, \"This is the same man as before. Where is the lama seated?\" and I looked about. The lama said, \"It is true that you really do not know who I am. I am Marpa. Prostrate yourself!\" I bowed down and, touching his feet to my head, I said, \"Precious lama, I am a great sinner from Nyima Lato. I offer my body, speech, and mind, and I humbly request food, cloth-ing, and dharma. Please look upon me with kindness so that I may attain buddhahood in this lifetime.\" The lama replied, \"Don't go on bragging to me that you are a great sinner. You were not driven to commit sins on my be-half. What evil deeds have you done?\" I described my circumstances at length and he said, \"So be it. In any case, it is good that you offered your body, speech, and mind. But you will not get food and clothing in addition to dharma. Either I will give you food and clothing and you will need to seek dharma from someone else, or I will give you dharma and you will seek food and clothing elsewhere. Choose between these two, but if you choose that I should give you dharma, whether or not you attain buddhahood in this life will depend on your own perseverance.\" \"In that case,\" I replied, \"since I came to the lama to receive dharma, I shall seek food and clothing elsewhere.\" As I was carrying my volume of scripture into the shrine"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA room, he said, \"Take your filthy book away. It would defile the sacred objects of my shrine.\" It occurred to me that he responded this way because my text contained works of black magic. I kept it in my own quarters and I remained there for several days during which time the la-ma's wife offered me enjoyable food. Thus Milarepa spoke. This was the first of the supreme deeds, the deed of his meeting the lama."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE At that point, I went begging high and low throughout the Lhodrak valley. I thereby gained twenty-one khalloads of bar-ley measured in the full dre vessels of Lhodrak. 10 With four-teen, I purchased a copper kettle with four handles, free of rust and grime inside and out. I used one load to buy meat and beer, and poured the remaining six loads into a large sack. I then placed the kettle on top of the sack and carried them back to the lama's residence. Exhausted when I arrived, I dropped the load to the floor, which caused the room to tremble. The lama, who was eating his meal, jumped up and said, \"You're an energetic young tyro. Do you also intend to murder us by bringing down the house with your brute strength? You're al-together unfit, so get rid of your barley.\" And he pushed it away with his foot so that I was forced to take it outside for a while. Without thinking badly of him, I simply said to myself, \"It seems that the lama has a fierce temper. I must watch how I behave and render service when in his presence.\" Then as an offering I presented the empty copper kettle and bowed down. He held the kettle in his hands and for a while stood there pensive, his eyes half-shut. At last, tears trickled down his face and he said, \"This is most auspicious. I offer it to Pai].chen Naro.\" He raised the kettle in his hands, sounded the handles, and struck it with a switch, ringing it as loudly as he could. He then carried it in to his shrine room where he filled it with melted butter from the butter lamps and set it down. At that moment, I was overcome with revulsion for the world and stricken by an intense longing for dharma. I repeatedly begged the lama to impart the dharma and his oral instructions."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"54 TSANGNYCIN HERUKA The lama replied, \"I have a great many faithful disciples com-ing from D and Tsang. The inhabitants of Yamdrok Taklung and Ling attack them, stealing their provisions and offerings with impunity. Cast hailstorms upon these two regions. This, too, will be religious work and I shall then grant you the oral instructions.\" I cast terrible hailstorms upon those two regions. Then Ire-quested the oral instructions. \"Was it for these meager bits of hail you cast that I brought back the dharma from India with such difficulty? If you need dharma no matter the cost: the highlanders of Lhodrak have attacked my disciples coming from Nyal Loro and they also show great contempt for me. You, who claim to possess great magic, cast black magic upon these men. When signs of its suc-cess appear, I shall grant you the oral instructions of Pal).chen Naro that I possess, which bring about awakening in one life and one body.\" I cast magic and the highlanders fought among themselves. Many belligerent men perished at the point of a sword. Seeing this the lama said, \"It is true you possess great magic, just as you claimed,\" and so he gave me the name Great Magician. Then I requested the oral instructions on awakening for at-taining buddhahood. \"Hah!\" he replied. \"Was it to reward the evil deeds you committed that I went to India without regard for my life, that I offered gold without concern for my wealth, and thereby was able to request the oral teachings that are the living breath of the qakin'is? You say you need them-that must be a \"joke, and a feeble one at that. This makes me laugh! If I were anyone else, I would kill you! Now restore the harvest of the Yamdrok people and heal all of the highlanders. If you do that, I shall grant the oral instructions. Otherwise, don't come see me again.\" Thus he scolded me, nearly hurling blows. The lama's wife consoled me as I fell into deep despair and shed many tears. The next day, the lama came and said, \"Last night I was quite hard on you, but do not be disheartened. Do not be impatient, for I give the oral instructions slowly. You are hardworking, so help build a tower for me to present to my son Darma Dode. When you are finished, I will grant you the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 55 oral instructions and also provide you with clothing and provisions.\" \"What will happen to me if I die before then without the dharma?\" I asked. \"I will see to it that you do not die before then,\" he replied. \"I do not possess dharma instructions empty of promise. Since you show tremendous perseverance, if you can meditate on my oral instructions, you will demonstrate whether or not you can become a buddha in this life. My lineage possesses a transmis-sion of blessings unlike any other.\" After the lama gave this comforting advice, my mind was set at ease. \"In that case,\" I said, \"please draw up plans for the tower.\" All the lama's paternal relatives had sworn an oath prevent-ing them from constructing fortifications in strategic locations. But Marpa had not taken the oath. So now he had the means both for deceiving them about his intention to construct a tower there and for purifying my negative deeds. Standing on an eastern spur of the mountain he said, \"Build a tower like so,\" and I began building a round tower. When I was about half-way finished, the lama came and said, \"I didn't consider things earlier. Tear down this tower to its foundations and carry the earth and stones back to the places you found them.\" And so I did. Then, on a western spur ot the mountain, the lama acted as if he were drunk on beer and said, \"Now, build a tower like so,\" and I began building a semicircular tower. Again, when I was about halfway finished, the lama came and said, \"This also will not do. Here too, carry the earth and stones back to the places you found them.\" And so I did. We then went to a northern spur of the mountain and the lama said, \"My dear Great Magician, the other day I was drunk and did not give proper instructions. Now, build a fine tower right here.\" I replied, \"Building towers and then tearing them down is nothing but toil for me and a waste of your resources. Please consider this carefully.\" \"This time, I am not drunk. I have considered the matter"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA carefully. This will be called the 'mantrika's tower' and should be triangular, so build it in that shape. You will not need to tear this one down.\" I began building a triangular tower. When I had finished about one-third of the construction, the lama arrived. \"Great Magician, whose tower are you building? Who gave you in-structions?\" he demanded. \"Surely the lama himself ordered the tower for his son,\" I replied. He said, \"I don't recall giving any such instructions. If what you say is indeed true, I must be either absentminded or com-pletely crazy.\" \"At the time,\" I reminded him, ·\"I feared something like this might happen and I requested that you carefully consider the matter. You said that you had considered it carefully, and that this time I wouldn't need to tear it down. I clearly remember this.\" \"Well then,\" the lama replied, \"who is your witness of this? Did you intend to lock me up here in this tower, which looks like a triangular magic dungeon, and cast your spells? I have neither plundered your estate nor squandered your patrimony. If that is not the case and you indeed desire dharma, then, since the local guardians are displeased, carry the tower's earth and stones back to the places you found them. Then if you want the dharma, I shall grant it. If you won't do it, then leave.\" Speaking in this way, he worked himself into a rage. I was overcome by deep depression but still yearned for dharma. So in accordance with the lama's instructions, for the triangular tower as well, I carried the earth and stones back to the places I found them. Meanwhile, a sore appeared on my back. I thought, \"If I show it to the lama, he will only scold me. If I show it to the lady, it will look like I'm complaining about my work.\" I kept the sore to myself and wept. Then I called upon the lady to help me request the dharma. She went before the lama and said, \"I know now that you are insufferable since you have assigned such pointless work on these towers. Be compas-sionate and grant Great Magician the dharma.\" He replied, \"Prepare a good meal and then bring him to me.\""},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 57 Carrying the meal with her, the lady brought me before the lama. \"Great Magician,\" he said, \"do not accuse me, as you did yesterday, of a deception I did not commit. If you want the dharma, I shall grant it.\" He gave me the transmission and vows of ordinary refuge. He added, \"That is all called ordinary dharma. If you wish for the extraordinary oral instructions of Secret Mantra, you must act in this way.\" Then he narrated a brief account of Naropa's life and his practice of austerities, concluding, \"It will be difficult for you to live up to such an example.\" This engendered a powerful faith that moved me to tears, and I resolved to do whatever the lama commanded. Several days passed and the lama asked that I attend him dur-ing a walk, which I did. We reached the land protected by the lama's paternal relatives. He said, \"Now, in this place you shall build a square tower, pale gray in color, nine stories tall, with a spire reaching the tenth story. It will never be torn down. When it is finished, I will give you the oral instructions. You may then enter meditation retreat and I will supply your provisions.\" \"In that case,\" I replied, \"might the lady be present as a wit-ness to these promises?\" \"Very well,\" said the lama. He then drew an outline for the foundation and I invited the lama's wife. In the presence of both lama and lady I said, \"I have already built three towers and I have torn them down. The first time, the lama said he had not considered the matter. The second time, he said he was drunk. The third time, he asked if he were absentminded or completely crazy. When I reminded him of the instructions he had given me, he asked who was my witness and then scolded me at length. This time I have invited the lady as a witness to these promises, so please attest to them.\" The lady replied, \"It is fine for me to serve as witness, but the lama is a strong-willed judge and will not likely consider my testimony. To start with, the lama is building towers with-out reason and tearing them down without reason. More to the point, this land is not ours alone. It has been pledged to all our relatives and will so become a source of infighting. Even if I plead, the lama will not listen to me.\""},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA The lama said to his wife, \"You shall serve as a witness. I will act as I have promised. I will not have you raise objections to serving in this way. Now go.\" Then I laid the foundation for a square tower. While I was building the walls, Ngokton Chodor of Zhung, Tsurton Wange of Dol, and Meton Tsonpo of Tsangron playfully rolled a boul-der into place as a foundation stone. When I had reached the second story beside the main door, Marpa arrived. He looked everything over and was pleased. Then, pointing a finger at the stone that had been rolled into place by his three senior disciples, he asked, \"Great Magician, where did this stone come from?\" I replied, \"Your three senior heart-son disciples playfully brought it here.\" \"In that case, their stone is not an appropriate addition to your work on the tower. Remove the stone and carry it back to the place it came from.\" \"But you promised that this tower would not be torn down,\" I replied. \"That is so. But it is not fitting that my disciples, who are practicing the two stages of yoga, be pressed into service as your servants. Don't tear down the entire structure, but remove the stone and return it to the place it came from.\" So I tore down the tower from the top down and returned the stone to its place. \"Now,\" the lama said, \"once again fetch the boulder and set it down as a foundation stone.\" Lifting it up I had to exert as much strength alone as all three of them together, but I returned it as it was before without much difficulty. It became known as my strongman stone. While I was laying the foundation on the mountain spur, the paternal relatives all held council and said, \"Marpa is building fortifications on the oath-bound mountain, so we must defend our land.\" Some said, \"Marpa has gone crazy and has a very strong novice from Lato building towers on every outcropping and mountain spur without a plan. When they are half fin-ished, he is being forced to tear them down and to return the earth and stones to the places he found them. He will tear this"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 59 one down too. If he does not, we are right to defend our land. Let us watch if he tears it down or not.\" I did not tear it down, hut worked on the tower continu-ously. By the time I reached the seventh story, a sore had ap-peared on my waist. The paternal relatives then said, \"Now, he is not going to tear it down. The first ones he demolished were a cover for building this one. We will destroy it ourselves.\" With this, they prepared their forces. Just then, the lama con-jured miraculous emanations filling the tower inside and out with a band of armor-dad soldiers. The relations said, \"Where did Marpa Lotsawa find so many soldiers?\" They were all ter-rified and, unable to attack, each came forth in private to pay his respects and beg for pardon. Thus they all became his pa-trons and submitted to his local rule. At that time, Meton Tsonpo of Tsangron came to request the great initiation of Cakrasa~vara. The lama's wife said, \"This time, you should try by all means to obtain initiation.\" I thought, \"So far, I have built the tower without help carry-ing so much as a stone the size of a goat head, a basketful of earth, a single bucket of water, or a spadeful of mud. So now he will grant me initiation.\" I offered prostrations and then sat down in line for the initiation. \"Great Magician, what do you have for the initiation fee?\" asked the lama. I replied, \"I have the lama's word that he would grant ini-tiation and oral instructions when I completed my service of building his son's tower. That's why I am seated here so he may grant them.\" The lama said, \"I did not acquire the initiations and oral in structions from India with such difficulty in order for you to make a little tower no bigger than my forearm. If you have something for the initiation fee, bring it. Otherwise, don't sit in line with those about to receive the initiation of profound Secret Mantra.\" He slapped me, grabbed me by the hair, and threw me out. At that moment I wanted to die. lsat crying the entire night. The lama's wife then appeared and said, \"The lama declares,"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"6o TSANGNYON HERUKA 'The dharma teachings I carried back from India were brought for the benefit of beings.' Were even a dog to appear before him, he would teach it dharma and then dedicate the merit of having done so. I don't know why he won't accept you. But in any case, don't form wrong ideas about him.\" In the morning, the lama came and said, \"Great Magician, from today on stop your work on the tower. Instead, build a covered walk at its base with twelve pillars and an inner sanc-tuary. When they're done, I will give you initiation and oral instructions.\" With that I laid the foundations £or a covered walk and began construction. All the while, the lama's wife provided me with well-seasoned food and enough beer to keep me slightly drunk. Like that she comforted me and showed me great affection. As the covered walk neared completion, Tsurton Wange of Dol came to request the great Guhyasamaja initiation. The la-ma's wife said, \"Now son, you should by all means receive the initiation.\" She gave me a ball of butter wrapped in leather, a bolt of woolen cloth, and a small copper kettle. I presented them as offerings and then sat down in line for the initiation. The lama said, \"Great Magician, what do you have for the initiation fee that allows you to sit in line?\" \"A ball of butter, a bolt of woolen cloth, and a small copper kettle,\" I replied. The lama said, \"Those things were already given to me by other.patrons. You may not use my own possessions as your initi~tion fee. If you have something of your own, bring it. Otherwise, do not linger in line for my initiation.\" He stood up and, rebuking me at length, kicked me and threw me outside. I wanted to sink into the earth. I thought, \"I killed many people casting black magic and destroyed many crops sending hail. Could this be the karmic ripening of those deeds? Does the lama know I will never be fit for the dharma? Is it because he has so little compassion for me that he does not teach me? Whatever the reason, what's the use of a human body without the dharma, which only collects misdeeds? Should I kill myself? Should I kill myself?\" At that moment, the lama's wife brought me a portion of the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 61 consecrated food offerings. She consoled me for~ a long time and then left. I had no appetite for the offerings and spent the entire night weeping. In the morning the lama came and said, \"Now, finish raising the covered walk and the tower and then I will give you initiation and the oral instructions.\" I resumed work on the tower and was nearing completion of the walk when another sore appeared on the small of my back. My back festered with sores while pus and blood oozed from the three wounds. Showing them to the lama's wife, I reminded her of the promises made when I laid the foundations for the square tower. I begged her to think of the dharma and to help me request the teachings. She took a good look and broke down in tears, crying, \"I will speak to the lama.\" She went to the lama and said, \"Precious lama, all this work Great Magician is doing on the tower has covered him with open wounds. Three have formed on his back, oozing incredi-ble amounts of blood and pus. In the past I have heard of and even seen such wounds appear on the backs of horses and don-keys, but I have never seen or even heard of them appearing on the back of a man. It would be shameful if others were to see or hear about such a thing. It is disgraceful that this was caused by a great lama such as yourself. Since he is so pitiful, please give this child the dharma. You did say at the outset that you would give the dharma when the tower was finished.\" \"That is just what I said,\" replied the lama. \"When the tower is ten stories high I will teach the dharma. But where are the ten stories?\" \"He has built a covered walk that exceeds ten stories in scope.\" \"'Much talk, no work,' it is said. I will give him dharma when the ten stories are complete. Does he really have a sore?\" In anguish, the lady replied, \"Your power has blinded you to the truth. Not only does he have a sore, his back is festering with sores.\" And she hurried away. \"Well then,\" called out the lama, \"send him up.\" So I went, wondering if he would grant the dharma. The lama said, \"Great Magician, show me your sores.\" I revealed them and he looked carefully. At last, the lama said, \"My lord"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA Naropa underwent twelve great trials and twelve minor trials, twenty-four different trials meted out upon his own body, all of which surpass yours. As for me, I served Naropa without regard for my life or my wealth. Therefore, if you yearn for the dharma, continue to work on the tower without bragging about your own activities.\" \"He is right,\" I thought. From my clothing, he fashioned a pad for my sores and said, \"I also do this for horses and don-keys, so use the pad for your wounds and continue to carry the earth and stones.\" I replied, \"What use is a pad for wounds when my entire back is festering with sores?\" \"It will help to keep out the dirt,\" he said. Thinking this was the lama's command, I carried earth in a vessel in front of me and mixed the mud plaster. Seeing me, the lama thought, \"A person who carries out whatever the lama commands is most extraordinary,\" and he secretly shed tears. My sores worsened and I fell ill. I sent for the lama's wife and asked that I be given the dharma, or at least be allowed to rest until the sores healed. She presented this to the lama, who replied, \"He shall not receive the dharma until the tower is finished. If he has strength to work, he should do what he can. If he doesn't, let him rest.\" The lady said to me, \"Rest without working until your sores have healed.\" While I rested she provided me with food, which fortified me, and for a few days I was happy except for con-cerqs that I had not obtained the dharma. When my sores had mostly healed, the lama, making no men-tion of the dharma, said, \"Great Magician, it is time to resume work on the tower.\" As I was preparing to do so, the lama's wife said, \"Let's make a plan for you to obtain the dharma.\" We talked it over. Then, placing my book and a few religious items atop a small sack of flour, I went to a spot where the lama would see me. To the lady I said, \"Please help send me off,\" and I pre-tended to leave. The lama's wife called out, \"I shall ask the lama and surely now you will receive the dharma. Whatever happens, you must stay.\" And she pretended to keep me from going."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA Witnessing this, the lama said, \"Dakmema, what are you two doing?\" She replied, \"Great Magician once came from a distant land to see the lama and devote himself to dharma, yet when he ar-rived he was not granted the teachings. Instead, he received only scolding and abuse. He fears he will die without the dharma, so he is taking his belongings and says he is going in search of another lama. I agreed to help him secure the dharma from you and am trying to keep him from leaving.\" \"I see,\" said the lama and, stepping out, he repeatedly slapped my face. \"You already offered me your body, speech, and mind right when you first came to see me. Where do you think you're going now? Surely you aren't leaving. I am master of your body, speech, and mind, and in fact I could cut them into a hundred pieces. If you're leaving in spite of that, tell me why you are carrying flour from my house.\" He threw me down and beat me. Then he went inside carrying the sack of flour. My despair had no end, like that of a mother who has lost her only son. I consulted with the lama's wife and, unable to bear the lama's overwhelming presence, I retreated inside where I sat weeping. She said, \"Try what you may, the lama will not grant you the dharma. But by autumn's end, he surely will. Until then, I will do so.\" She gave me the meditation method ofVajravarahf. It brought about no inner experience but it helped my mind a great deal and lifted my spirits. I thought I should repay the lady's kind-ness, and that she could purify negative deeds since she was the lama's wife. I rendered her service while she performed her summer chores, standing by her stool when she milked the cows and by her pan when she roasted barley on the hearth. I felt at that time that I must seek another lama. But thinking it over carefully, I was convinced that no other lama but this one had the oral instructions for attaining buddhahood in one life and one body. I thought, \"Even if I don't attain buddhahood right now, at least I have ceased accumulating karma for re-birth in the lower realms later on. When I have suffered trials for the sake of the dharma as did Naropa, the lama will be"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA pleased and I will obtain the oral instructions. Then I will med-itate on them and achieve buddhahood in this life.\" So once again I carried earth and stones and resumed the mud plaster-work for the covered walk and sanctuary. At that time, Ngokton Chador of Zhung and his retinue ar-rived carrying many offerings in order to request the great ini-tiation of Hevajra. The lama's wife said to me, \"If the service you have rendered so far through your work on the tower is not enough, and the lama is interested only in wealth, then this time present an offering and you shall receive the initiation. First offer him this and then make your request. If he does not grant it, then I shall appeal on your behalf.\" She gave me a beautiful turquoise, large and reddish, that she kept as a pri-vate possession. I offered it to the lama and said, \"This time, you must please grant me initiation.\" Then I sat down in line for the initiation. The lama examined the turquoise, turning it around. \"Where did you get this, Great Magician?\" he asked. \"The lama's wife gave it to me,\" I replied. \"Call Dakmema here,\" he said, smiling. I requested the lady to come. The lama asked her, \"Dakmema, where did we get this tur-quoise?\" The lama's wife offered many prostrations. Then she said, \"This turquoise has never been the master's property. When my parents first sent me to the lama he went into a rage. My parents to_ld me, 'Tuck this away without showing anyone. If you and your husband should separate you will need it.' They gave it to me as my own private property and, with an overwhelming feeling of intense compassion, I have given it to this child. I beg the father to accept it. Look upon Great Magician with kind-ness and grant him initiation. In the past he has been thrown out from the initiation line, causing him great despair. So this time, lama Ngok and assembled disciples, please help present my request.\" Saying this, she offered many prostrations. Cowed by the lama's ferocious temperament, Ngok and his followers were unable to submit another request. They said only, \"It is so,\" and offered prostrations, as did the lady."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA The lama said, \"Through Dakmema's scheming a fine tur-quoise almost fell into a stranger's hands.\" He tied the turquoise around his neck and continued, \"You haven't thought carefully, Dakmema. If I am wholly your master, I am surely master of the turquoise. Great Magician, if you have wealth, bring it here and take the initiation. The turquoise is mine.\" I lingered, wondering if the lady might renew her request in the fervor of offering the turquoise. But the lama turned furi-ous and sprang up saying, \"What impudence! I sent you away but you did not go.\" He threw me facedown and everything went dark. Then he threw me on my back and I saw stars. Then he grabbed a staff, but Ngok held him back. Meanwhile, in terror I jumped through a window and escaped. Although the lama was actually concerned, he pretended to be angry. I was not harmed but was so distraught that I resolved to kill myself. Then the lama's wife came up to me in tears and said, \"Great Magician, do not despair. Never has there been a disci-ple more beloved or dear than you. It is right for you to request dharma from another lama. I shall make preparations for you to meet with one and provide you with offerings and provi-sions for religious practice.\" Thus she consoled me. Previously, the lady was required to take part in whatever religious feast offerings the lama per-formed, but that night she stayed with me as a companion in tears, weeping until daylight. In the morning, the lama called me before him. I went, wondering if he would grant the dharma. \"Are you not dissatisfied that I would not grant you initiation yesterday? Is your opinion of me not shaken?\" he asked. \"My faith in the lama has not been shaken,\" I replied. \"I believed it was in response to the terrible sins and defilements of my past actions, and I was overcome with despair.\" I wept. The lama said, \"What do you hope to gain by putting on an exaggerated display of tears for me? Get out!\" Stepping out in a state of heartrending misery, I thought, \"I had provisions and gifts when I carried out evil deeds. When I practice dharma I have no wealth at all. This is what has be-fallen me. If I had even half the gold I used when I practiced evil deeds, I would obtain initiation and oral instructions. Now,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"66 TSANGNYON HERUKA without offerings, this lama will not grant instructions. Even if I went to another lama, I would not find one who did not re-quire offerings. Without wealth, I will never get the dharma. A human body without dharma fosters evil deeds.

Or, since I have given up magic cast through wicked means, I could return home. My mother would be happy to see me and I might earn some money. In any case, whether I seek out the dharma or seek out wealth, I must leave.\" I thought that taking the lama's flour would only incite his displeasure so, carrying my books, I left without telling even the lama's wife. Along the way I remembered the lady's kind-ness and was overcome with poignant memories. I reached a spot a half-day's journey from Drowolung and it was time to prepare my meal. I first begged some barley flour and then bor-rowed a cooking pot. I gathered water and wood, kindled a fire, cooked my meal, and ate it. Half a day had passed. I thought, \"Half of the work I performed was service to the lama and half was payment for my food. Preparing just one meal this morning was hard work. But the lady every day performed the arduous task of cooking my meal and side dishes, and this morning I didn't even wish her well. I am an evil man.\" I thought I should perhaps go back, but could not bring myself to do so. · As I was returning the cooking pot, an old man said to me, ·\"You seem like a young man, fit for work. Rather than beg, recite scriptures if you are able to read. Or if you cannot read, work as a servant and you will get both food and cloth-ing. Do you know how to read?\" \"I am not a beggar all the time, and I know how to read.\" \"That is excellent. In that case, recite scriptures in my home for a few days and I shall pay you.\" I was overjoyed. I stayed at his house and read the Perfection of Wisdom in eight thousand lines. I read the life story of Taktungu, who, while penniless, was able to renounce life and"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA limb for the dharma. I thought, \"He was certairr to die if he gave up his heart, yet he was still resolved to sell it. Compared to him, I have barely suffered hardship at all for the dharma. It's possible that the lama will give the dharma. If he does not, the lady has promised to help me find another lama.\" Finding the courage to return, I headed back. Meanwhile, when I had left the lama, his wife said to him, \"The master's indomitable enemy has gone. Are you happy now?\" \"Who has gone?\" he asked. She replied, \"Wasn't it Great Magician whom the master treated with abuse, like a deadly enemy?\" His expression turned dour and a tear ran down his cheek. \"Kagyu lamas, qakinis, and dharma protectors,\" he called out, \"turn around my fortunate son.\" Then, covering his head, he sat there quietly. At that point, I carne before the lama's wife and bowed down. Elated, she said, \"You have done just the right thing. Now it seems the lama will grant you the dharma. When I said you had gone away he said, 'Turn around my fortunate son,' and broke down in tears. The lama's compassion seems to have drawn you back.\" I thought, \"The lady consoles me. If it were really true that the lama shed tears and. called me fortunate, I would be grati-fied. But if he only said, 'Turn around,' then I am certainly not fortunate, as he has not granted me initiation or oral instruc-tions. I have nowhere else to go. Must I be miserable here with-out obtaining the dharma?\" To the lama the lady said, \"Great Magician has not forsaken us, he has returned. May he come bow down before you?\" The lama replied, \"It's not that he has not forsaken us. He has not forsaken himself. But if you want to send him in then do so.\" I went and bowed down. The lama said, \"If you wish for the dharma from your heart with such restlessness and urgency, you must be willing to give even your life for it. Therefore, com-plete the remaining three stories of the tower and then I shall grant you the oral instructions. Otherwise, since it is a burden"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"68 TSANGNYON HERUKA to feed you and since you seem to have somewhere to go, then leave.\" Unable to respond, I went outside. To the lama's wife I said, \"I long to see my mother and the lama still will not grant me the dharma. If he would grant the dharma when I finish the remaining work on the tower, it would be worthwhile to stay. But what he does is incredible. It's just an excuse for him to avoid granting the dharma even after I finish working on the tower. Please let me go to my village. I pray for the master's and lady's good health.\" Offering prostrations, I took my book and prepared to leave. The lama's wife said, \"My son, you are right. As I already promised, I will find a way for you to obtain the dharma from Ngokton, who is a senior disciple of the lama and possesses the oral instructions. Stay a little longer and pretend to work.\" Gratified at this, I stayed and worked. Paq.chen Naropa had a custom of preparing an extensive feast offering of ritual cakes on the tenth day of the lunar month. Marpa therefore also prepared them on the tenth day of the moon. On one such occasion, the lama's wife prepared three large measures of beer each from ·one khal load of barley: one strong, one moderate, and one weak. Again and again the lady had the resident disciples bow before the lama and ply him with the strong first pouring of beer. The lady and I repeat-edly filled the bowl. The resident disciples drank the moderate draft, while the lady only brought the weak beer to her lips and did not drink much. I did likewise and remained sober. The resident disciples, however, became drunk. As for the lama, with many people offering him strong beer, he became quite drunk and fell into a deep sleep. Meanwhile the lady took the lama's seal, as well as Naropa's six ornaments and rosary made of ruby, from his residence. She had a letter already prepared that was made to look like the lama's own written statement, and she affixed the seal on top of it. She then wrapped the articles in a fine cloth, sealed it with wax, and handed them to me, saying, \"Act as if these were entrusted to you by the lama. Offer them to lama Ngokpa"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA and request the dharma.\" She sent me to Zhung, and I de-parted, placing my hopes in lama Ngokpa. After two days had passed, the lama asked his wife, \"What is Great Magician doing now?\" \"He is on the road. I don't know anything more than that,\" she replied. \"Where has he gone?\" \"He told me that although he had done so much work on the tower, you did not give him the dharma but only much scolding and abuse. Then he set off, saying he was now going to search for another lama. Although I might have warned the master, you took no interest. You would have showed no pity and only beat him more. So I said nothing. I did the best I could to stop him but he would not stay. He has gone.\" The lama's expression turned grim. \"When did he leave?\" he asked. \"He left yesterday,\" replied the lady. For a moment Marpa sat there in thought. Then he said, \"My son has not yet gone far.\" Meanwhile, I arrived at Riwo Kyungding in Zhung. Lama Ngokpa was explaining The Two Divisions11 to his resident disciples. He had just reached the passage: I am the expounder and I am dharma. I am the disciple endowed with good qualities. I am the world teacher and the goal. I am the world and beyond the world. I am the nature of coemergent joy. At that moment I made prostrations from a distance. The lama removed his hat, returned a greeting, and said, \"This is the manner of homage used by disciples in the lineage of lama Marpa. The auspicious connection of his arrival at this junc-ture in the dharma talk is most excellent. He will become mas-ter of all the dharma. Go ask who he is.\" One of the resident disciples came up to me and, recognizing me, asked, \"Why have you come here?\""},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"70 TSANGNY6N HERUKA \"Lama Marpa is very busy. Since I am the only one he hasn't had time to teach, I've come here to request the dharma. He has sent as his gifts Naropa's ornaments and his ruby rosary.\" The disciple went up to the lama and said, \"It's Great Magician.\" Then he recounted my story. Overjoyed, the lama exclaimed, \"Having Lord Naropa's ornaments and rosary come to my home is as rare and as marvelous as the Udumbara flower. a We must greet them. We shall stop at this fine place in the teaching. Disciples, fetch parasols, victory banners, and musical instruments, and come quickly. We must salute the lay-man Great Magician.\" I had remained at the place where I made prostrations, so a disciple came and informed me. I later called the place where I made prostrations Chaktsal Gang (Prostration Hill). I too sa-luted and at that moment a procession of disciples came to greet me carrying an incredible display of parasols, victory ban-ners, and musical instruments. We reached the lama's chambers. I offered prostrations and handed over the gifts. His eyes filled with tears and he held the gifts up to his head and received their blessings. Next he placed these excellent sacred objects on the shrine, giving them a place of central importance among very fine offerings. Then he read the letter aloud: To Ngok Choku Dorje: I am entering closed retreat and Great Magician is impatient. I am sending him to you to request the dharma, so grant him initiation and teach him the oral instructions. As tokens of my permission to do this I am sending Naropa's ornaments and his rosary made of ruby. Lama Ngokpa said, \"Since this is the lama's command, I will certainly give you initiation and oral instructions. I had thought I should invite you so your arrival is a sign of the la-ma's compassion. Many disciples are coming to me from Kham, Dakpo, Kongpo, and Yarlung. Evil men from Yepo and Yemo in Dol steal their dharma provisions with impunity. Cast a hailstorm upon them. Then I will give you initiation and oral instructions.\""},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 71 I thought, \"I am destined to perform evil deedS; If I cast a hailstorm, I will receive the genuine dharma but will also ac-crue the karma of such a heinous crime. If I don't cast one, it will amount to breaking the lama's command and I will not get the dharma. There is no way I can avoid casting a hailstorm.\" I gathered the materials, taking with me ritual substances charged by mantras, and left for the countryside. There I set to work and hail began to fall. In Yepo, I lodged in the home of an old woman, taking shelter from the rain. Lightning flashed. Thunder clapped. A dark cloud gathered and one by one, then two by two, hailstones began to fall. Weeping, the old lady said, \"What shall I eat when my crops are beaten down by hail?\" \"Surely, I am committing an evil deed,\" I thought. Then I said, \"Mistress, quickly draw the shape of your field.\" \"It is like this,\" she said, and she drew an elongated triangle. I performed a yogic gaze and covered the drawing with an iron pan. A tip of the triangle remained uncovered and that part of the field was devastated by fierce winds . .I was certain about the hailstorm and I went to look. The central mountain slopes of the two regions were all swept into deep ravines. All the other fields were completely washed away. But the old wom-an's field was left standing fresh and unharmed except for the tip, which was struck by hail and then flattened by the rushing flood. In later times, hail never again fell upon that field, and it is said that the old woman did not need to pay hail taxiJ on the entire field but only on the tip that was destroyed by the flood. Then I headed back. Along the way I met an old shepherd and his child whose cows and sheep had been carried away by the flood. To them I said, \"I did this. Do not attack lama Ngokpa's disciples. If you attack them I will continue to cast hailstorms like this.\" They conveyed this threat and the two regions thus respectfully paid reverence to the lama. They be-came his patrons and later offered him their service. I came upon the corpses of many small birds lying beneath a thicket and corpses of birds and mice all along the road. I col-lected them as I went along, filling the hood of my rain cover"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"TSANGNY6N HERUKA and the lower skirts of my cloak. I piled the corpses in a heap before the lama, and said, \"Precious lama, I came here for the genuine dharma, but have done only evil deeds. Look upon me, a terrible sinner, with compassion.\" And I cried. The lama replied, \"Layman Great Magician, you need not worry so much. We in the lineage of Naropa and Maitrfpa have an oral instruction called 'driving one hundred birds with a single slingshot' through which terrible sinners may swiftly be-come a buddha. All of the beings now killed by the hailstorm will in the future be born as the first members of your retinue in your pure realm when you are a completely perfect buddha. Be happy that until then, through my power, they will not take rebirth in an unfortunate realm. If you do not believe me, watch this.\" After resting in contemplation for a moment, he snapped his fingers and all the corpses suddenly came back to life. In that instant some flew up in the sky, while others scurried on the ground, each going back to its own home. I saw the lama as an actual buddha and I thought, \"How wonderful! How wonderful! It is indeed gratifying that, on this occasion, so many sentient beings have died.\" The lama then imparted the Hevajra initiation. After he gave the oral instructions, I fixed up a south-facing cave on the side of a ravine overlooking the lama's residence. Then I sealed myself in. The lama gave dharma instructions through a small window and I meditated without distraction. Since I had not received Marpa's permission, no experience whatsoever occurred. On one occasion, the lama said, \"Layman Great Magician, have such-and-such signs appeared?\" \"None whatsoever have appeared,\" I replied. \"What are you saying? As long as there is no stain of broken commitments in my lineage, the qualities of experience and re-alization develop quickly. It could not be otherwise. You have come with faith in me. If you didn't receive Marpa's permis-sion, why did he send the gifts? What's going on? In any case, apply yourself and meditate.\" I was paralyzed with fear. I wondered whether I should di-vulge the real story. But lacking the courage to speak, I thought,"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 73 \"I must, by all means, remain lama Marpa's disciple.\" Then I applied myself and stayed in meditation. Meanwhile, lama Marpa had the remainder of his son's tower completed. A letter from him arrived at Ngokpa's residence. It said: Here, I am presently in need of tamarisk cane roofing for my son's tower. Send ahead an offering of as many loads of tamarisk cane as you can. I shall all at once raise the tamarisk roofing and golden spire, consecrate the tower, and celebrate Darma Dode's coming-of-age. Come attend those yourself. Furthermore, you have a certain evil person who belongs to me. Bring him as well at that time. Lama Ngok came to the window of my cave and, showing me the letter, said, \"From the way this letter describes me as having an evil person, it seems that you did not receive the la-ma's permission.\" I replied, \"I did not really have the lama's consent. The la-ma's wife gave me the letter and the religious items and then sent me here.\" . \"What's this? In that case, the work we've been doing is pointless. If you didn't receive the lama's permission then the qualities of meditation will never manifest. There is nothing to be done. He ordered you to return. Will you go or not?\" \"I request to go as your servant,\" I said. \"In that case, I have ~ent the tamarisk cane, and afterward someone will arrange a time for our departure. Until then, re-main in retreat.\" The person who arranged the time for our departure re-turned and appeared at my window. We discussed in detail how the tower consecration and the son's coming-of-age cele-bration would be performed. \"Was there any talk about me?\" I inquired. \"There was. The lady asked, 'What is my son doing?' I re-plied that you were in strict retreat. So she asked, 'Other than that, what is he doing?' I replied that you were staying in an"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"74 TSANGNYON HERUKA isolated place. She then said, 'He left this item of his behind. He played with it while he lived here, so deliver it to him,' and she handed this over to me.\" The messenger loosened his belt and handed over a single die made of clay. Thinking it was touched by the lady's hands, I placed it to my head to receive blessings. When the messenger left, I was taken with a desire to play dice, so I played. \"I had never before played dice in the lady's presence,\" I thought. \"I suppose she no longer thinks of me kindly. And it was dice that long ago drove my ancestors from their homeland.\" Swinging the die above my head, I threw it down. It broke open and a scroll of paper appeared, which I read. It said, \"Now the lama will give initiation and oral in-structions even to you, son, so come with lama Ngok.\" I was overjoyed and danced back and forth in the cave. Then lama Ngokpa said to me, \"Layman Great Magician, prepare to leave.\" I did so. Lama Ngok gathered all of his household items, including all the religious representations of body, speech, and mind-leaving behind only the blessed items given by lama Marpa himself-as well as his gold, turquoise, silks, and garments. He ordered me to leave an old she-goat with a broken leg that could not follow the herd. Apart from that, he took all his livestock from the sta-ble and the meadow. As we were preparing to depart, the lama said to me, \"Since you have also been helpful to me, take this as a gift for your meeting with lama Marpa,\" and he gave me a bolt .of silk. His wife too gave me a leather bag of soft cheese and said, \"Take this as a gift for Lady Dakmema.\" Then lama Ngokpa, together with his wife and retinue, set out and arrived at the lower reaches of Drowolung. The lama said, \"Layman Great Magician, go on ahead and inform the lady that we are coming. See if she might send some beer.\" I went ahead and first met the lama's wife. I offered her the bag of soft cheese. Then I said, \"Lama Ngok is coming, so please give some beer to welcome him.\" Overjoyed, she replied, \"The lama is in his residence, so go present this request yourself.\" I went to make the request.

I prostrated from the west, but he turned to look toward the south. \"Revered lama,\" I cried, \"it is right that you will not accept my prostrations in order to punish me. Lama Ngok is arriving, carrying as offerings all of the valuables he possesses: religious representations of body, speech, and mind, gold and turquoise, as well as all the livestock he owns, crossbred yaks, horses, and so forth. It seems that he would like some beer to welcome him, so I request that you please send him some.\" Rising in anger, he snapped his fingers and said in a fierce voice, \"When I returned from India I brought with me, from among the inconceivable collections of the Buddha's teaching, the extraordinary heart-instructions that extract the essential meaning of the four classes of tantra. At that time, not so much as a lame bird came to greet me. It is not possible that I, a great lotsawa, should greet him simply because he is coming, driving with him a few straggling animals. Now go back.\" I reported the lama's words to his wife. She said, \"The lama answered in anger. Ngok is a great man and needs to be greeted. Let us, mother and son, both go.\" \"Lama Ngokpa does not expect the lama or the lady to greet him.\" \"If he has requested a portion of good beer, I too will go,\" said the lady. Some disciples brought a large quantity of beer and she went to greet him. Meanwhile, many people from Lhodrak gathered to cele-brate the coming-of-age of Marpa's son and the consecration of his residence, held together with a lavish feast. From the rows of celebrants, lama Marpa sang this song of auspiciousness and benediction: I address my prayer to the lamas endowed with kindness.

When he finished, lama Ngokpa presented his offerings and said, \"Precious lama, in general terms the lama is master of my three gates.

Please look upon me with compassion and grant initiation and all the foremost oral instructions, in par-ticular the instructions of the aural scrolls.\" He then offered prostrations. Lama Marpa appeared pleased and said, \"Indeed, as you say, my foremost profound initiations and oral instructions are, generally speaking, the short path of the Vajra Vehicle, the oral instructions by which one becomes a buddha in this life without having to wait for innumerable eons. In particular, the instructions of the aural scrolls are restricted by the command seal of the lama and if.akinis. Thus they will be difficult to ob-tain if you do not offer the goat, even though she is old and in-firm. I have already given the other oral instructions to you.\" A wave of laughter erupted from all those seated there, but lama Ngokpa again asked, \"If I bring the old milk goat and offer her, will you lift the command seal and grant the instructions?\" \"If you bring the goat and offer it, I shall.\" In the morning, when everyone had dispersed, lama Ngokpa set out alone. He returned carrying the goat on his back and offered it to the lama. Very much pleased by this, the lama said, \"You can truly be called a disciple of Secret Mantra who maintains his commitments. I have little use for a goat but needed to emphasize the great value of the dharma.\" He then promised to impart many of the foremost initiations and oral instructions. Later he did so. Then some small groups of disciples from afar and family members gathered together and performed a feast offering of appreciation. Marpa sat at the head of the assembly row with a long acacia-wood staff resting at his side. He stared straight at lama Ngokpa and pointed a finger menacingly. \"Ngokton Chodor,\" he said, \"what is your reason for granting initiation and oral instructions to the evil man called T opaga?\" He glanced at the staff. Terrified, Lama Ngokpa offered prostrations, saying, \"Precious lama, you sent to me your letter directing me to confer initia-tion upon Great Magician and to teach him the oral instructions, together with the ornaments of Naropa and his rosary made"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA of ruby. Doing so, I carried out your command. I therefore feel neither shame nor regret, and am not worthy of reprimand or blame. Please understand this.\" He lifted his eyes nervously. Pointing a menacing finger at me, the lama said, \"Where did you get those objects?\" My heart ached as if it were being torn out and I was so ter-rified I could hardly utter a word. With a trembling voice I said, \"The lady gave them to me.\" The lama jumped up, grabbed the acacia-wood staff, and went to beat his wife. Having anticipated this, the lady had al-ready gotten up and moved some distance away, where she now sat. She then fled inside the shrine room and shut the door. The lama scratched at the door several times and finally returned to his seat. He ·said, \"You, the one called Ngokton Chodor who has acted without permission, bring my ornaments of Naropa and ruby rosary this instant.\" Then he covered his head with his shawl and sat there. Lama Ngokpa immediately offered prostrations and left to fetch the ornaments and rosary. I had fled at the same time as the lady and, overcome with sadness and despair, I sat secretly weeping. I saw lama Ngokpa when he appeared outside and begged him to take me along as his servant. He said, \"If I were to take you without receiving the lama's permission, things would only end up as they did today and we would both be miserable. So for the moment, stay. Later, if he really won't ac-cept you as a disciple and grants his permission, I shall do whatever I can.\" \"Well then,\" I replied, \"it's on account of my great sins and obscurations that such misery has fallen upon you, lama, and your lady. Since I will not obtain the dharma in this life, and since I have been accumulating terrible sins, I will kill myself. When I am reborn in a future life with a precious human body, I beg that you hold me with compassion.\" As I was about to kill myself, lama Ngokpa restrained me. Weeping, he said, \"Layman Great Magician, don't do such a thing! You must understand that according to the tradition of Secret Mantra, the Victor's ultimate teachings, our aggregates, constituents, and the sense fields are deities. Performing trans-"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 79 ference before it's time carries the offense of killing a deity. Killing oneself is an even graver sin. Even in the tradition of the sutras, there is no worse negative act than taking one's own life. Therefore, listen to these injunctions and give up all thoughts of suicide. It is still possible that the lama will give you the dharma. If he does not, you will certainly obtain it from another lama.\" While he was giving me this advice some other disciples, un-able to bear my misery, went up to see if it was a good time to intercede with the lama. Others came down to comfort me. I was overcome with such anguish that I thought, \"Is my heart made of iron? If not, it will burst and I shall die.\" It was because I had done terrible actions in this first part of my life that I experienced such suffering in order to request the dharma. Thus Milarepa spoke. At this point in the story, not a single person among all those listening to the discourse could keep from bursting into tears. Some, overcome with feelings of world-weariness and renun-ciation, nearly fainted. This was the second of the supreme deeds, the deed in which he purified negativities and obscurations through misery and despair."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX Then Rechungpa asked, \"Under what circumstances did lama Marpa then accept the Jetsiin as a disciple?\" Milarepa continued: The resident disciples went back and forth between us and after a while Marpa rose from his contemplation. In a calm mood he said, \"Bring Dakmema here now.\" Someone went to bring the lady. When she appeared he said, \"Where have Ngok Choku Dorje and the other disciples gone?\" \"In accordance with the lama's command that he bring Naro's ornaments and rosary, lama Ngokpa prepared to fetch them and went outside. Layman Great Magician made this-and-that request, and lama Ngok is with him now offering this-and-that advice.'' Thus she described the scene in detail. A tear ran down Marpa's face. He said, \"Those called 'dis-ciples of Secret Mantra' must be like that, and he has turned out to be just so. Now I feel compassion for my disciples, so call them.\" One of the resident disciples went to call lama Ngokpa. He approached and said, \"The lama is now calm and has sent me to call you in, so please come.\" \"Compared to the happiness of those with karmic fortune,\" I said, \"I, a man of evil karma, lack the fortune to go before the lama when he is calm. And if I did go, I would receive only scolding and abuse.\" I sat there weeping. Lama Ngok also stayed, and to the resi-dent disciple he said, \"Explain Layman Great Magician's rea-sons to the lama and see if it is acceptable for Great Magician"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA to approach him. If I do not stay here in the meantime, there is the danger that he will do something terrible.\" The disciple explained my reasoning to lama Marpa, who replied, \"In the past he would have been right. But now I have no need to act in such a manner. On this occasion, the chief guest is to be Great Magician. Dakmema, go and call him.\" The lady arrived beaming with a smile and said, \"Layman Great Magician, this morning it seems that the lama will ac-cept you as a disciple. The lama said this time you are to be the guest of honor and he sent me to call you. It is a sign that he is moved by deep compassion. He did not even scold me. Rejoice and let's go.\" I wondered whether this time it was true and, wrongly filled with doubt, I went in and took my place in the row of guests. The lama said, \"If we examine things carefully, none of us is at fault. From my side, I have only tormented Great Magician in order to purify his negative deeds. Had his work on the tower been in my own interest, I would have directed him more gently. So, in this matter I was correct. As for Dakmema, to begin with she is a woman. She also has tremendous compassion and could not bear the situation, so she too was correct. But forging the letter and sending the gift of religious objects were serious offenses. As for Ngok Choku Dorje, you were correct, as you have stated. However, return the religious objects for a short time. I will give them to you later. As for Great Magician, he was burning with desire for the dharma, so he was correct to obtain it by any means possible. Ngok did not know that Dakinema had sent a forged letter. Thus I see no reason to pun-ish him, even though he granted Great Magician initiation and oral instructions. \"Although I may have let loose a flood of heated and mis-guided words, they were not like those of a worldly person. However they may have appeared, from the perspective of the dharma they were intended to wear down self-importance and so, in essence, they lead to the path of enlightenment. Those of you seated in line who do not understand the dharma, don't lose faith."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA \"Had I the opportunity to punish this son of mine nine times, he would have become a buddha devoid of physical remainder and without needing to take another human birth. Since this did not happen, some slight residue of negativities and obscu-rations remains, brought about by Dakmema's foolishness. Still, your major negativities have been eradicated by means of eight great agonies and many minor adversities. Now I shall accept you as a disciple and give you the oral instructions that are like this old man's heart. I shall then give you whatever supplies you may need for retreat and set you to meditate. So rejoice!\" At that moment I wondered, \"Is this a dream or is it really happening? If it is a dream, I would be happy never to awaken.\" I was filled with immeasurable joy at this thought, and I of-fered prostrations while shedding tears of pure delight. Thus the entire assembly-the lady, lama Ngokpa, and the rest-thought, \"The lama showed great skill and mastery when wear-ing him down and great compassion when accepting him as a disciple. The lama himself is truly .a buddha.\" They were filled with even greater faithful admiration, and out of affec-tion for me they shed tears, cried thanks, and offered prostra-tions. Finally, in a festive mood, the entire assembly held a ritual feast. That evening, offerings were laid out at the place where the assembly had gathered. The lama said, \"I shall give you the common vows of individual liberation.\" After my hair was shaved and my clothes changed, the lama said, ~Your name was originally foretold by Naropa in a dream I had before we met.\" He gave me the name Mila Dorje Gyaltsen and then granted me the vows of a layman and the bodhisattva precepts. Then he offered me a skull cup of inner offerings with the special blessings of his mental powers. Everyone thus clearly saw the oblation bubbling with light rays of the five colors. He first of-fered it to the lamas and chosen deities. Next Marpa himself partook. Then he gave the skull cup to me and I emptied it completely. \"This is an auspicious omen,\" said the lama. \"Tasting the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA nectar of my inner offerings is greater than all four initiations of some other lineages. However, starting tomorrow, I shall give you the ripening initiations of Secret Mantra.\" Then he constructed an extensive mandala of Cakrasa111vara with sixty-two deities. When he revealed the mandala for be-stowing the initiation, he pointed to the circle of colored pow-der. \"This is called the symbolic mandala. The actual mandala is there,\" he said and he pointed up to the sky. I clearly saw Cakrasa111vara surrounded by the heroes and 4akin is of the twenty-four lands, the thirty-two sites, and the eight great charnel grounds, all vividly present. At that moment, the lama and the deities of the mandala in a single voice conferred upon me the secret name Pel Zhepa Dorje. The lama imparted at length the oral transmission of the tantra and then taught the complete practice of the quintessential instructions along with the performance of rituals. Then, placing his hand on my head, he said, \"Son, I knew from the very beginning that you were a worthy disciple. The night before your arrival at my home, I had a dream that was a sign you would benefit the Buddha's teaching. Dakmema had a similar dream in which women served as religious stewards, 4akinis who had come to act as custodians of the dharma. Thus you appeared as a disciple given to me by the lama and 4akinis. This being the case, I went to greet you in the guise of a plowman. You drank all the beer I gave you and plowed the entire field, signs that you would be a worthy recipient of the oral instructions and that you would perfectly master thein. The four handles on the copper kettle you offered are signs of the coming of my four famous disciples. The vessel's lack of blemishes such as grime is a sign that your mind will be little blemished by mental afflictions and that your body will gain control in the bliss-warmth of yogic heat. Because you of-fered the kettle empty, you will have only meager sustenance while you meditate. But in order to bring about great resources for you later in life and for your line of disciples, and in order that worthy disciples be satisfied by the elixir of the oral in-structions, I filled it with melted butter from my offering lamps.

Therefore the disciples in your lineage will, in the beginning, have all the es-sential qualities of a student, including faith, diligence, wisdom, and compassion. In the middle they will have little attachment to the pleasures of this life and, with perseverance in the face of austerity, will show great fortitude while meditating in the mountains. Finally, endowed with experience, blessings, knowl-edge, and kindness, they will become fully qualified lamas. The teachings of the Kagyu will thus expand like the waxing moon, so rejoice!\" This prediction uplifted and encouraged me, filling me with joy. It was the beginning of my happiness. Thus Milarepa spoke. This was the third of the supreme deeds, the deed of his receiv-ing initiation and oral instructions."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN Again Rechungpa asked, \"Did the Jetsiin set forth into moun-tain retreat right after receiving the oral instructions, or did he remain with the lama?\" Milarepa continued: The lama directed me to exert myself in practice. Providing me with ample supplies, he then set me to meditate at Taknya Cliff in Lhodrak. During that period, I filled an offering lamp with melted butter and lit it. Then I placed it on my head and meditated day and night without moving my body until the lamp was extinguished. Eleven months passed. Then the lama and his wife came, bringing lavish supplies for a ritual feast. The lama said, \"Son, for you to meditate for eleven months without your cushion growing cold is most ex-cellent. Now tear down the cell door and come beside your old father to rest your weary body and discuss the experiences you have had.\" \"This is the real sustenance for my weary body,\" I thought. \"But since it is my lama's command I must go.\" As I began tearing down the door, the cell suddenly felt quite dear to me and I stood there reluctant to continue. Just then the lama's wife came up and asked, \"Son, are you coming?\" \"I cannot bring myself to tear down the cell door,\" I replieq. \"There is nothing wrong,\" she said. \"In general, Secret Mantra emphasizes the importance of profound auspicious connections. More importantly, the lama has a fiery temper so it will not do to mishandle this auspicious moment. Your mother will tear Jown the cell door, so come quickly.\" She tore it down. Thinking that she was right, I came out."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"88 TSANGNYON HERUKA The lama said, \"The two of us, father and son, shall prac-tice the rituals for cultivating dear realization.

Relax your mind and describe what kind of understanding, experience, and realization you have had.\" Feeling great faith and devotion toward the lama, I knelt down and joined my palms in prayer. With tears streaming from my eyes, as a prelude to presenting my experience and realiza-tion, I first offered this sevenfold service to the lama in song: I bow to your various emanation bodies Displayed before impure disciples, And to your venerable enjoyment body Revealed to your circle of pure disciples. I bow to your speech, at once audible and empty, Which enunciates the eighty-four thousand true dharmas With the sixty qualities of Brahma's voice To each person in his own language. I bow to your mind, changeless reality body, Which embraces all objects of knowledge While remaining unobscured by conceptual marks In the space of the luminosity reality body. I bow down at the feet of great lady Dakme, Birth mother of the buddhas of the three times, Unchanging selfless (dakme) illusory body Dwelling in the pure palace of reality's expanse. I prostrate with unfeigned devotion To the spiritual sons you have gathered, The assembly of disciples who practice as taught, Together with all of their followers. In your presence I offer my body And whatever material offerings exist"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA Throughout all realms of the universe. I confess each of my negative deeds. I rejoice in all forms of merit. I pray that you turn the great wheel of dharma. I pray that the glorious lama remain Until life's round is emptied. I dedicate my accumulated virtue to the benefit of sentient beings; \"Having first offered the sevenfold service in this way,\" I continued, \"to my sovereign master, I present the meager un-derstanding I have gained through the utterly pure enlightened activity of the lama-inseparable from Vajradhara-his con-sort and children, through the power of the blessings of his immeasurable compassion, and through his unbounded kind-ness. I pray listen to my words of little eloquence with your mind in the state of unchanging reality. \"I have understood that, due to the fundamental condition of ignorance, the body comprised of flesh and blood fully formed, together with its perceiving consciousness, initially coalesce through the twelve links of dependent origination, formations and so forth. For those with merit who desire liberation, it is a ferry to a future life of freedoms and endowments. For those with evil karma who amass sinful deeds, it is a guide leading to the lower realms. This is a truly decisive moment, the boundary between journeying up or down, and one that determines the profit or loss leading to lasting good or lasting evil far into the future. \"Moreover, relying upon your power as lord and guide of beings, I seek release from the ocean of life's round, the source of all suffering so difficult to escape. I first sought refuge in the lama and three jewels and then trained properly in the disci-pline. I have understood that in such a context, the source of all goodness and happiness is the lama. Therefore, the primary and essential point is to follow whatever he commands and to maintain the sacred commitments purely. Then, intensively contemplating the difficulty of attaining the freedoms and en-dowments of a human rebirth, death and impermanence, the causes and effects of actions, and the faults of life's round, one"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"90 TSANGNYON HERUKA is overwhelmed by the desire for liberation from life's round. One should then rely on the appropriate vows of individual liberation, which are like the foundation. Upon such a basis, one gradually ascends through the religious vehicles, guarding as closely as one's eyes the disciplines they describe. If trans-gressed, the vows must be restored. \"But since it is a mistake to practice the Lower Vehicle seeking happiness and peace for oneself, through the desire to free all sentient beings from life's round in its entirety, one generates the mind set on enlightenment. With love and compassion, every-thing one does is dedicated to the benefit of others-this, I have understood, is arousing the attitude of enlightenment according to the Great Vehicle. One gives up the path of Hearers and Solitary Buddhas and enters the path of the Great Vehicle. Then, maintaining a completely pure view as a basis, one enters the path of the unsurpassed Vajra Vehicle. In order to realize a com-pletely pure view, one needs a fully qualified lama with the wis-dom and skillful means to impart all the pure rites of the four initiations, and to transmit their meaning without error. Initiation or 'empowerment' means to have power over the profound view and from that point on one meditates in a gradual way. First, in the common Dialectics Vehicle, one sets out in search of the selflessness of persons. Employing numerous examples and reasons drawn from both scripture and logic, one does not find a self, and indeed one comes to realize the selflessness of persons. One must then rest the mind evenly within the state in which the self was not found. When it is brought to rest through various means, conceptual thoughts cease and the mind relaxes in a non-conceptual state. When months and years pass by without noticing and one needs to be informed of the time by others, then one has achieved serenity. One maintains this state by means of mindfulness, and without succumbing to mental sinking or torpor, one draws forth the vitality of awareness. Thus one experiences serenity in this way: appearing while lacking self-nature, luminous while lacking conceptuality, naked, un-adulterated, brilliant, vivid. \"It is also possible to take up the practice of insight, although genuine insight will not manifest for ordinary individuals. I be-"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 91 lieve only those who have attained the first bodhisattva level will experience it. This being the case, one incorporates out-ward appearances onto the path by relying upon visualization practice. Other kinds of visionary experiences, deities and so forth, may appear through the practice of serenity, but I be-lieve they are merely signs of meditation and have no essence whatsoever. \"In brief, experience of excellent serenity together with vital-ity in practice, as well as analysis by means of a profound dis-criminating wisdom, are indispensable for the attainment of insight. I consider them to be like the lower rungs of a ladder. I have understood that whatever kind of serenity meditation one practices, such as those with signs or those without signs, developing an attitude of love and compassion must precede them all. Whatever one does, it must be embraced by the atti-tude of enlightenment that aims to benefit others. Next, with a completely pure view one should train in meditation that lacks a reference point. Finally, one practices within a state free from reference points, sealed by prayers dedicated to the benefit of others-this is supreme among all paths. \"I have understood that, just as the knowledge of food does not help a starving man, but rather he needs to eat, it is not enough to comprehend the meaning of realizing emptiness-one must meditate. In particular I have understood that, in order to realize insight, one must strive without distraction to accumulate merit and purify misdeeds in the periods between meditation sessions. \"In short, I have now understood that the experiences of emptiness, evenness, ineffability, and non-conceptuality gained by yogins through practice are the view of the stages of the path of the Secret Mantra Vajra Vehicle, which correspond to the four initiations. In order to actualize my understanding of these things I will mortify my body, deprive myself of food, and bridle my mind. Having done so, I will shape my perception and withstand even the possibility of death so that whatever happens I will recognize everything as having the same taste. \"I have not come before the lama and lady, whose kindness I cannot repay, to present a token material offering.

Meanwhile, I continued my meditation in ·re-treat as before. About this time, the lama traveled to Oru in the north for the benefit of beings. One night, as he conducted a ritual feast at the home of Marpa Golek, a {f.akini deciphered one of Naropa's symbolic teachings that he had not understood before then and encouraged him through signs. Thinking he should go to see Naropa, Marpa returned to Drowolung. One night, while he"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 93 was resting there for a few days, a woman appeared to me in a dream, blue in color, beautifully adorned in garments of pure silk and bone ornaments, her eyebrows and f-acial hair brilliant gold. \"Son,\" she said, \"you already have the instructions on the Great Seal and the Six Dharmas through which one becomes a buddha by meditating for a long time. But you do·not have the special instructions on Ejection and Transference through which one becomes a buddha by meditating for a single instant. Request it!\" Then she disappeared. Thinking it over I wondered, \"Although the woman appeared in the guise of a 4akini, is this a prophetic command of the 4-iikinis or a demonic obstacle? I don't know. Whatever it is, there is nothing that my lama, in essence the buddhas of·the three times, does not know, from the instructions for attaining buddhahood down to advice for fixing a broken clay pot. If it is a prophetic command of the 4akinis, I must by all means request Transference.\" Then I pulled down the mud wall of my cell and went to see the lama. \"Without maintaining strict retreat, there is a danger that ob-stacles may beset you,~' said the lama. \"Why have you come?\" I described the woman who appeared and what she said. \"I don't know if it is an obstacle or a prophetic command. If it is a prophetic command, then I have come to request that you grant the instructions on Transference.\" The lama reflected for a moment and then said, \"It is a pro-phetic command of the 4£ikinis. When I was returning from India, Pal)chen Naropa spoke about Transference but I do not remember requesting it. I will look through my texts from India and search for it.\" For a whole day and night without break we, master and disciple together, searched for texts on Transference. We came across numerous manuals on Ejection but did not find a single word about Transference. The lama said, \"The signs that appeared while I was in Oru in the north have also encouraged me to request these instructions. There may be other instructions as well that I do not know, so I will go request them.\" l reminded him of his advanced age, but he would not be Jissuaded on any account. He exchanged his disciples' offer-"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"94 TSANGNYON HERUKA ings for gold. Then, carrying a vessel filled with gold, he set off for India. Naropa had departed to engage in yogic activity and Marpa intended to pursue him without regard for his own life. He in-terpreted numerous omens that foretold that they would meet. Praying fervently, he eventually met Naropa in a dense forest and invited him to the hermitage of Pullahari where he re-quested instructions on Transference. Pai].chen Naropa asked, \"Did you think of this yourself or did you receive a prophetic command?\" \"I neither thought of it myself nor received a prophetic command. I have a disciple named Topaga who received the prophetic command of a qakini and he came to request it from me.\" \"How marvelous. In the gloomy land of Tibet lives a man like the sun rising over the snows.\" Raising his hands in prayer to the crown of his head, Naropa continued: In the gloomy darkness of the north Lives the one called Topaga Like the sun rising over the snows. To that man I bow down. He closed his eyes and bowed his head three times. All the mountains, trees, and plants in India then bowed toward Tibet. Even now the mountains and trees of Pullahari bend in the direction of Tibet. Naropa then imparted all the instructions of the qakini aural transmission, and afterward he interpreted certain omens. Based upon the way Marpa prostrated, he re-ceived the prophecy that stated, \"Although your family lineage will be short, your dharma lineage of enlightened activity will extend longer than the stretch of a river.\" Marpa then returned to Tibet. Later Marpa's son Darma Dode passed away, just as fore-told by the prophecy of his prostration style. During the offer-ing ceremony commemorating the anniversary of his son's death, the senior disciples, seated in line among all the resident students, said to the lama, \"Precious lama, your son, who was"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 95 like the buddhas of the three times, can no longer work for the merit of us sentient beings and the lama is himself advanced in age.

I also have Pal).chen Naro's excellent prophetic command regarding the Kagyu teachings.

Everyone had dreams and some dreams were good, but none of the dreams revealed a prophecy. I had a dream of four great pillars, which I described to the lama in this way: In accordance with Lord Vajradhara's command, To the lama I set forth my dream from last night And the way it appeared before me.

Now, you disciples, your hour has come. If you pay attention to the words of this old man now, The practice lineage teachings will spread in the future. When he had finished, all those assembled were filled with immeasurable joy. Then, for his senior disciples, the lama opened the treasure chest of dharma and oral instructions. By day he gave teachings and by night he set us in meditation. Everyone developed excellent meditative experience. One evening during this period, while imparting the pro-found initiation of Nairatmya, the lama contemplated which dharma transmission lineage and activity would be m9st suit-able for each of his foremost disciples so that he might give them the appropriate instructions. He resolved to interpret the omens at dawn the next morning. At dawn, while resting in a state of luminosity, he observed his foremost disciples. He saw that Ngokton Chador of Zhung was studying how to explain several commentaries of the Hevajra Tantra; Tsurton Wange of Dol was meditating on Ejection; Meton Tsonpo of Tsangrong was meditating on Luminosity; and I was meditating on yogic heat. Thus he knew which dharma transmission lineage and activity was suitable for each one of us. To lama Ngokpa he gave the heart-instructions on the method of explaining the tantras from the perspective of the six parameters and the four modes, '4 strung together like pearls, as well as Naropa's six ornaments, his ruby rosary, a pair of ritual ladles for making burnt offerings, and an Indian commentarial text.

Then he said, \"Wander among rocky mountain ranges and the snows, and gain experience in the view and in meditation.\" All the assembled resident disciples then performed a ritual feast, and from the head of the row Marpa said, \"I have given you oral instructions in accordance with the omens I have ob-served. Similarly, my disciple lineages will each maintain their own oral instructions as the principal means for bringing about great benefit and carrying out vast enlightened activity. My son Darma Dode is no longer present. I have entrusted to you my lineage of oral instructions and blessings that stems from our Kagyu forefathers. Therefore, apply yourselves and beings will further benefit.\" The senior disciples then departed, each to his own religious seat. To me the lama said, \"As for you, stay with me a few years. I have special initiations and oral instructions yet to im-part. You will need to consolidate your experience and realiza-tion in the presence of the lama. Therefore remain in strict retreat.\" I withdrew to Zangpuk, a cave prophesied by Naropa. The lama and lady both treated me with great affection, sending a share of food from each of the ritual feast offerings they performed. Thus Milarepa spoke.

In retreat, my spiritual practice proceeded well. Normally, I did not sleep, but at dawn one morning I fell asleep and had the following dream. I arrived at niy village of Kyangatsa and found my house Kazhi Dunggye cracked like the ear of an old donkey. Of the valuables inside, leaking water had damaged the sacred scriptures of the Ratnaku!a. Of the fields outside, Orma Triangle was overgrown with weeds. Of my family, my elderly mother was dead and my sister had gone off wander-ing as a beggar. Because my relatives rose up as enemies against us, mother and son were separated in misery while I was still young, and we never met again. This filled me with immeasur-able sorrow. I called out the names of my mother and sister and wept. When I awoke my pillow was damp with tears. Thinking this over brought my mother to mind. I shed many tears and resolved to do whatever I could to see my old mother again. Day broke. I tore down the door of my cell and went to see the lama. He was asleep when I arrived.

At that moment, with the sun rising over the house, rays of light shone through a window by his pillow and fell upon his head. At the same time the lama's wife en-tered bringing his meal. The lama said, \"Son, why have you suddenly broken your strict retreat and come here? You run the risk of encountering demons and obstacles.· Go back right away and stay in retreat!\" Once more I described my dream and offered the following request: Lord, Ak~obhya in essence, compassionate one, Please let this beggar return to his homeland one time.

But if you are counting on returning later, your coming here to make this request and finding me asleep is an omen that we, father and son, shall not meet again in this life. However, the sun rising over the house is an omen that you shall illuminate the Buddha's teachings like the sun. In particu-lar, the sunlight shining upon my head is an omen that the teachings of the Practice Lineage shall flourish and spread. Dakmema bringing food offerings is an omen that you shall be sustained with the food of concentration. Now there is noth-ing for me to do but to let you go.

The lama said, \"Very well now. Lord Naropa gave me the prophetic command that I should bestow upon you these oral instructions. Thus I have done so. You too must transmit them to a single disciple, who will be prophesied by the 4akin'is, with the seal that it be handed down through a line of single indi-viduals for thirteen generations. Furthermore, should you give away these instructions for food, wealth, or enjoyments of this life, you will incur the punishment of the 4akin'is. Therefore, practice while strictly adhering to these commands. When a fortunate disciple appears, even if he lacks material offerings, accept him by imparting the oral instructions and in doing so spread the teachings. Attempting to break him down as Tilopa did to Lord Naropa, or as I did to you, will be of no benefit to those of less capacity, so set aside that style of teaching dharma. \"In India there are supplementary teachings to these trans-missions that carry looser restrictions-these are the Nine Dharma Cycles of the Formless I)akin'is. Of these I have given you four. For the five that remain, someone of my lineage should go request them from the descendants of Naropa and bring them back. This will benefit sentient beings, so you should receive as many of them as you can. \"If you think, 'Perhaps I have not received the oral instruc-tions in full because I lacked material offerings,' understand that ·I have no interest in material offerings. It is the offering of your accomplishment and your perseverance that bring me happiness. Therefore, persevere and raise the victory banner of your accomplishment. \"From among Lord Naropa's oral instructions there are the oral instructions of the 4akin'i aural transmission that my other principal disciples have not received. I have given them to you in full as though filling a vase to the brim.\" Then taking his chosen deity as a witness, the lama swore, \"My words are not false and there is nothing to add to or take away from my oral instructions.\" Then he sang this song:"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 107 Namo. To the compassionate one I address my prayer. Contemplating the lives of past masters endowed with compassion Is itself the very oral instructions. Hoping to accumulate many is cause for distraction. Keep in your heart the essential instructions. Much this and that without the essential Is like many trees but no fruit. They may have their merits but they are not the ultimate. Studying them is not seeing the truth. They have much to explain but have nothing of profit. Take to heart that which profits-a treasure sublime. If it's wealth you desire, concentrate upon this. Dharma is the path of means for taming afflictions. If a safe path you'd keep, concentrate upon this. A resolute mind is a master of contentment. If it's a fine master you wish for, concentrate upon this. Give up the whining and sloth of life's round. A rock crag with no one around is your father's house; A friendless and lonely abode, the deity's home. Mind riding mind is a tireless steed; Your body, a wilderness hermitage, a temple. Unwavering virtue is the best of all medicines. To the one endowed with a meaningful life I gave oral instructions lacking nothing of value. Me, my instructions, and you yourself, These three I place in the hands of my son. And thus without rotting, scattering, or withering, May the leaves of their fruit blossom forth.

Seated at the head of the assembly row, the lama revealed his body in numerous forms: the bodies of chosen deities such as Hevajra, Cakrasa111vara, and Guhyasamaja; hand implements such as a vajra and bell, a wheel, a jewel, a lotus, and a sword; seed syllables such as the letters om, ah, and hum in white, red, and blue; and visible and . . . invisible spheres of light. \"These,\" he said, \"are called miracu-lous transformations of the body. Revealing them casually serves little purpose. I have displayed them now on the occa-sion of Milarepa 's departure.\" I saw the lama in truth as a buddha and was filled with un-imaginable joy.

Do you believe?\" asked the lama. \"I have seen,\" I replied. \"And I am powerless but to believe. I thought that I too should attain feats such as these through . meditation.\" \"Son, if that is so then you may go.

At some point an obstacle will arise in your practice with the channels and subtle winds.

The lama's pronouncements at that time benefited me greatly and made a lasting impression on my mind.

Although it will sadden me, I must go see him off.\" To me he said, \"Sleep near me tonight. Father and son will talk.\" So I slept near the lama, and when the lady arrived she broke down and wept, expressing great sadness. The lama said, \"Dakmema, why do you weep? He has re-ceived the profound instructions of the aural transmission and is going off to meditate in mountain retreats. What need is there for tears?

Now this son-endowed with faith, diligence, wisdom, and compassion, and who did whatever he was told without fault-will be separated from us while still alive. This is why I can't bear my grief.\" With this she sobbed even more. I choked up with tears and the lama cried too. Master and disciple were so preoccupied by thoughts about each other that their spirits sank and they wept. There was little conversation that night. Morning broke and the master, together with some thirteen disciples, accompanied me for a half day's journey, bringing with them excellent provisions. As they walked along the way, they all showed their affection through body, speech, and mind, expressing their sadness, engaging in heartfelt conversation, and making many warm gestures. Then, atop a mountain pass called Cholagang commanding a clear view in every direction, we per-formed a fine ritual feast. Seated at the head of the row, the lama took my hand in his and said, \"Son, now that you are traveling to D and Tsang, throughout these lands, at Silma Pass in Tsang and elsewhere, there's the serious danger of encountering bandits.

The lama and retinue were a dark mass seated at the same place on the mountain pass. I felt a powerful longing to see them and wondered if I should go back. But reflecting on this, I thought, \"I have received the oral instructions in their entirety. Never again shall I commit deeds that are not in ac-cord with the dharma.

We compared our understanding of the oral instructions. In explaining the tantras, he surpassed me, and in their practice I was not far behind. But in the special cjakini aural transmission, I surpassed him. I paid my respects and offered prayers. Then I set off for my homeland, arriving there in three days. I was delighted to find that I had quite a capacity for controlling the subtle winds.•s Thus Milarepa spoke.

Rechungpa then said, \"In that case, how did the Jetsiin ar-rive at his home? How did he meet with his countrymen when he first arrived?\" Milarepa continued: When I first arrived in the upper end of the valley, at a spot where I could see my house, there were many herdsmen. I asked them the names of the local places and what the locals were like. They answered in detail. Then I pointed to my house. and asked, \"What is that place called? What do they say about the people who live there?\" · \"That down there is called Kazhi Dunggye. It has no one but ghosts for residents.\" Pressing for details, I asked, \"Are the people who used to live there dead or have they left the village?\" \"At one time, they were among the wealthy people in the region. Then the father, who had just one son, died prema-turely and without properly arranging his last will and testa-ment. After the father's death, paternal relatives seized all of his only son's wealth. They were supposed to return it after the son grew up, but refused. Out of revenge, he cast magic and hailstorms, and the region was devastated.

It is said that some dharma texts remain in the house down there. Yogin, if you dare go, you should have a look.\" \"How much time has passed since this happened?\" \"Some eight years have passed since she died. Only distant memories of the magic and hail remain. I merely heard about it from others.\" I thought that, since they feared my dharma protectors, they would not be able to harm me. I felt certain that my old mother had died and my sister had gone missing. Filled with sorrow, I sat weeping in a hidden spot until the sun went down. When the sun had set I went into the village. Just as in my dream, the fields outside were overrun with weeds and the house, once like a temple, had buckled. Stepping inside, I saw the texts of the precious Ratnakit!a Sutra damaged by leaking water and falling debris. Birds and mice had made nests in them, covering the books in their droppings. I looked at this scene and took it in, and I was filled with sadness. Then I walked across the doorstep and found a heap of rags caked with dirt over which many weeds had grown. When I gathered them up, a number of human bones, bleached white, slipped out. When I realized they were the bones of my mother, I was so overcome with grief that I could hardly stand it. I could not think, I could not speak, and an overwhelming sense of longing and sadness swept over me. I was on the verge of fainting. But at that moment I remembered my lama's oral in-structions. I then blended my mother's consciousness with my mind and the wisdom mind of the Kagyu lamas. I made a cush-ion of my mother's bones and rested in a state of luminosity without letting my three gates waver for even an instant. I saw the true possibility of liberating both my mother and my father from the suffering of life's round. Seven days passed and, emerging from my absorption, I thought things over: \"I am convinced that all of life's round is"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":":IE LIFE OF MILAREPA 119 ·ithout essence.

I then withdrew to a good cave on a ridge behind my house and stayed there in meditation. As I was sparing with my provisions and water, my body weak-ened but my practice improved and I was able to remain there for several months. Then, when my provisions ran out and I had nothing to eat, I felt I could not last any longer. I thought, \"I should beg for meat, butter, and cheese from highland no-mads and barley flour from lowland farmers. With continued sustenance I could go on practicing.\" I went to beg from the nomads. At the entrance to a tent I called out, \"Some alms of meat, butter, and cheese for a yogin, I beg.\" I had happened upon the tent of my aunt. She recognized me and, in her displeasure, immediately set loose her dog. I de-fended myself with stones and a staff. Then my aunt seized a tent pole and beat me repeatedly, shouting, \"Disgrace to your noble father! Dishonor to your family! Demon who devastated your homeland! Why have you come? A son like you born to such a fine father!\" I turned to flee but, malnourished and weak, I stumbled on a rock and fell into a pool of water. I nearly died while my aunt continued to rage.

A girl who was standing behind my aunt broke into long sobs and even my aunt felt ashamed. They both went inside and the girl returned carrying a ball of butter and a half-brick of compacted sweet cake that had spoiled. I begged at the other tents where I did not know anyone. But once they realized it was me, the occu-pants each stared intently and gave liberal alms. I left carrying their offerings with me. I knew from my aunt's reaction what my uncle would do, so I thought I must avoid him. But while begging alms from the farmers in the upper valley of Tsa, I arrived at the door of his newly relocated house. He recognized me and said, \"Though I am old like a corpse, you are just who I wanted to see.\" He flung a deadly stone, nearly hitting me. Then I too recognized him and turned to escape, but he mustered his strength and threw all the stones within reach. As I fled, he came out carrying a bow and ar-rows shouting, \"Traitor! Disgrace! Didn't you destroy this land? Countrymen, we have our enemy in our hands. Come out quickly.\" With this, he began shooting arrows at me, and taking his lead, young men from the region threw stones. I was afraid that my remorse for having once cast black magic would not placate them. So I decided to threaten them with magtc. \"Father Kagyu lamas,\" I called out, \"ocean of oath-bound blood drinkers. This yogin, a dharma practitioner, is beset by enemies. Come to my rescue.

Thinking I would provoke their anger if I stayed in the region, I decided to leave. But that night I had a dream indicating that it would be good to stay a few days in my former location. As I had lingered a few days, Dzese learned of my presence and came to see me carrying some excellent food and beer. She embraced me and then sat there sobbing. She explained how my mother had died and my sister had gone wandering, which filled me with great sadness. Then I too shed many tears. \"Why haven't you married after all this time?\" I asked her. She replied, \"People were afraid of your dharma protectors, and no man came forward to say he would have me. Even if someone had, I wouldn't have gone. That you practice dharma is most amazing. Now what will you do with your house and fields?\" Understanding her intentions, I thought, \"Through the kind-ness of Marpa the Translator I did not get mired in married life. From the point of view of dharma, it's enough to offer good prayers. But from a worldly point of view, I should say something to put her mind at ease.\" I said, \"If you see my sister, give them to her. In the mean-time, use the fields yourself. If you find out for sure that my sister is dead, you may take both house and fields.\" \"You don't need them for yourself?\" she asked. \"I practice austerities and seek food as do birds and mice, so I have no need for fields. I dwell in caves in uninhabited places, so I have no need for a house. Even if I were a master of the.entire world, I would still need to leave them aside at the time of death. So if I renounce these things now, I shall find happiness in this and all future lives. Doing so, my conduct is contrary to that of all other men, so you can say I am no longer a man.\" \"So is your conduct also contrary to all those who practice dharma?\" she asked. \"There are those who once fell prey to worldly pride and then, having learned to preach on a few religious books, took pleasure in their own gains and in the defeat of others.

It seems one of them is not the dharma. Were they equally dharma, I would still prefer theirs.\" \"I don't like the kind of dharma practitioners you worldly people favor. It seems that even those practitioners who wear saffron robes, while in agreement with my fundamental aims, still retain a slight affinity for the eight worldly concerns.

I shall practice dharma but I cannot follow a path like yours.\" And with this she departed. My aunt then learned that I had no interest in either the house or the fields. Several days passed and she thought, \"Since he says he is following the instructions of his lama, I shall see if I can acquire the fields for myself.\" She visited me carrying hccr, meat, butter, and other foods and said, \"The other day I hcha vcd foolishly, but you, my nephew, are a dharma practi-tioner, so you should forgive me.

Then one day my aunt appeared and said, \"People say that if I plow the fields, my nephew will cast magic with his dharma protectors. But you won't really cast magic, will you?\" \"Why would I cast magic? Since it will be virtuous work, sow the fields and bring me provisions.\" \"Well then, if it makes no difference to you, it would ease my mind if you'd swear an oath.\" I didn't know what she intended with this, but I thought that making people happy is dharma, so I swore an oath. This pleased her and she returned home. I then persevered in meditation but was unable to achieve the slightest quality of bliss-warmth. One night, while I was wondering what to do next, I had the following dream: I was plowing an uncultivated field but the earth was hard and I could not furrow through it. I wondered if I should give up. Just then Jetsiin Marpa appeared in the sky and said, \"Son, plow with diligence and perseverance. Though the earth is hard and uncultivated, you shall furrow through it.\" Thus Marpa guided me and I plowed the field, creating deep furrows. Excellent crops then sprang up. I awoke filled with joy but thought, \"If even fools don't cling to dreams, which are the mistaken projections of mental im-prints, then I am even more foolish than fools themselves.\" Nevertheless I took this as a sign that good qualities would emerge if I persevered in meditation.

For whom would I cultivate patience if there was no one to make me angry? Were I to die this very night, what would I do with my fields and these things?

But I also felt relieved to have disposed of my house and fields, so I resolved to go meditate at Drakar Taso as I had previously vowed. As my practice of meditative equipoise had taken a firm foothold in that cave, I called it Kangtsuk Puk (Firm Foothold Cave). In the morning, I took the payment for my fields and whatever other small items I had and, without anyone knowing, I le& for Drakar Taso. There was a most pleasant cave at Taso, and that's where I stayed.

In this way I attained some confidence about the Great Seal in my mind, but my physical strength weakened and, unable to control the subtle winds, I did not experience bliss-warmth in my body. I thus became intensely cold. I prayed to the lama one-pointedly, and one night I experienced a state of luminosity. While in that state I perceived that a host of women appeared saying lama Marpa had sent them. They performed an excellent ritual feast and said, \"If Milarepa has not given rise to bliss-warmth, Marpa instructs that he exert his three gates in the following way,\" and they demonstrated a series of yogic exercises. Accordingly, I sought physical well-being through the key point of an erect, squatting posture, \"binding of the six hearths.\" I sought verbal control through the key point of controlling the life force winds, \"binding of a plaited knot.\" I sought mental relaxation through the key point of self-liberation, \"binding of a coiled snake.\" Meditating in this way, a most wonderful bliss-warmth spread through me. When a year had passed, I felt a desire to go refresh myself. As I prepared to leave I suddenly remembered my earlier vows and I sang this song of scolding myself: Lord Vajradhara with Marpa's form, Bless this beggar to stay in mountain retreat. You there, amazing one, Milarepa: A song of self-counsel to help yourself. You are separated from friends who converse with you kindly. The valley where you seek entertainment is empty. The region where you hope to find solace is barren. Don't daydream, don't daydream. Rest mind in its place. Daydream and you think of all sorts of non-virtue."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA Don't waver, don't waver. Maintain stable mindfulness. Waver and virtuous practice is tossed to the wind. Don't go, don't go. Remain in your seat. Go off and your stride will be tripped up on stones. Don't slacken, don't slacken. Keep your head bowed. Relax and it all becomes futile and meaningless. Don't sleep, don't sleep. Practice virtuous conduct. Sleep and afflictions, five poisons, oppress you. After scolding myself in this way, I meditated day and night and my spiritual practice thus increased. Three years passed in this way. I had a plan to eat one load of barley flour each year. But once that was used up, I knew my life would be in danger if I had nothing else to survive on. I thought, \"Worldly men find one or two tenths of an ounce of gold and they rejoice, and when they lose it, they despair. But that can't be compared to dying without attaining buddhahood. A body used to achieve buddhahood is more valuable than even the whole third-order thousand-fold universe filled with gold. 18 It is better to die while continuing to practice than to break my earlier vow. What should I do now?\" I decided I would not go down to the vil-lage, but that I should search for some food to sustain my prac-tice of austerities. Since it would be for the sake of dharma, this would not break my vows. Stepping out in front of Drakar, I found a delightful spot with a commanding view where there was warm sun, excellent water, and many nettles growing. I moved over to it and stayed there living on nothing but nettles as I practiced. I had no clothes on my outside and nothing nutritious to sustain me in-side. My body thus became like a skeleton and turned the color of nettles, covered with soft green hair. During this time I wanted to clutch the text the lama gave me and I placed it upon my head. When I did, my stomach felt pleasantly full even though I had nothing whatsoever to eat, and I even"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREI'A 137 belched. I was tempted to break the seal on the scroll and read it but I received a sign that it was not yet the proper time so I set it aside. About a year had passed when several hunters from the mar-ket of Kyirong appeared at my dwelling, having failed to kill any game. At first they cried, \"It's a ghost!\" and fled. I assured them I was a man and a practitioner. \"It doesn't seem like he is, but let's see,\" they said. The hunters returned and scoured the interior of my cave. \"Where are your retreat provisions?\" they demanded menacingly. \"Give us some now and later we will return it in kind. If you don't, we'll kill you.\" \"I have nothing but nettles,\" I replied. \"Lift this hermit up and see if he has anything. I have no fear of being robbed.\" \"We will not rob you. What would we gain by lifting up the hermit?\" \"You will acquire merit,\" I said. \"In that case,\" they said, \"lift him up.\" They grabbed my waist and let me fall to the floor again and again. Even as my body, accustomed to ascetic practice, was filled with pain, I felt fierce, unbearable compassion and wept. One of the hunters, who had stood by without causing harm, said, \"Hey, you all, he seems to be a genuine religious follower. And even if he's not, you don't become a man by mistreating such a bag of bones like that. He has not forced us to be hun~ gry. Don't do that!\" Then to me he said, \"Wondrous yogin, since I did not dis-turb you, place me under the protection of your meditation practice.\" The others said, \"And those of us who did lift you up, place us under your protection too.\" One of the hunters added, \"Sure, but he'll find a different way of protecting you.\" They burst out laughing and went away. I didn't think of using magic but they eventually received the deities' retribution. It is said that the governor punished the hunters. The leader was executed and all the others, except for the individual who told them not to harm me, had their eyes put out."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA After a year or so had passed, my clothes were all worn out. I thought about sewing together the ragged blanket, now in tatters, my aunt had given me as payment for my fields, the empty flour sacks, and the remnants of my clothing to make a coverlet for my cushion. But then I thought, \"Were I to die to-night, sewing this would be pointless. It would be better to meditate,\" so I gave up the idea. Instead, I spread the blanket over the cushion and used it to wrap the lower part of my body. I dressed my upper body with each of the empty flour sacks. In this way, I used these materials to cover the parts of my body that needed it most. When they could no longer pro-tect me, I thought my renunciation had gone too far and that I should sew them together. But I could find neither needle nor thread, so I knotted together the three ragged sacks, one each for the upper, middle, and lower parts of my body, all of which I fastened with a jute rope around my waist. I did my best wearing this by day. At night I covered the cushion with the ragged blanket and tatters of cloth and continued as best I could. In this way I passed another year or so meditating. One day there arose a clamor of many voices. Looking out, I saw that several hunters, carrying a good deal of meat, had appeared at the entrance of my cave. Upon seeing me, those in front cried, \"It's a ghost!\" and fled. Those farther back said, \"You needn't worry about ghosts appearing in the daylight. Take a good look. Is it still there?\" \"I_t's still there,\" called the others. Some old hunters came forward from the rear and they too became frightened. I told them my story in detail, explaining that I was not a ghost but rather was a hermit practicing me-ditation in the mountains, and that my body had become like this due to lack of sustenance. \"We shall see if it's true or not,\" they said. Entering the cave, they found nothing at all but nettles. They were filled with faith and offered me a good quantity of meat and a portion of their barley flour. \"This sort of activity is truly amazing,\" they said. \"Please guide the animals we have killed to a higher rebirth"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 139 and purify the sinful deeds we have committed.\" Then they paid their respects and left. Filled with joy I thought, \"Now I have food to eat like a human.\" I ate some of the cooked meat and my body became comfortable, my constitution clear, and my awareness height-ened. Thus my spiritual practice was strengthened and a pro-found experience of bliss-emptiness arose as never before. I understood that the food and drink offered while practicing austerities in mountain retreat brings far greater merit than a hundred offerings made to those who carelessly pursue plea-sures in the village below. I ate the meat sparingly until finally it was full of maggots. I considered picking away the maggots and then eating it but then thought, \"I have neither the merit nor the right to do so. I shall not steal the maggots' share of food.\" I let them eat the meat and returned to my ascetic diet of nettles. One night a man came looking for a~y food or belongings I might have. He scoured the entire cave but I burst out laughing and said, \"See if you can find something at night in this place where I can find nothing by day.\" He laughed too and then went away. About another year had passed when several hunters from Tsa who had failed to catch any game appeared. I was clothed in the three cloth sacks tied with a jute rope and resting in meditative equipoise. They prodded me with the ends of their bows and said, \"Is this a man or a ghost? Judging by its looks and its garb, it is probably a ghost.\" I opened my mouth and said, \"I am most definitely a man.\" Recognizing the gap in my teeth, they asked, \"Are you Topaga?\" \"I am,\" I replied. \"In that case we request some food for now, which we will not fail to repay later. It was said that you once retUrned to the village, but that was many years ago. Have you been living here all the while since then?\" \"I have indeed,\" I replied. \"But I have nothing agreeable for you to eat.\""},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"TSANGNY0N HERUKA \"We will take whatever you eat. That will be enough for us.\" \"Very well then, build a fire and cook some nettles.\" When they had built a fire and cooked some nettles they said, \"Now we need some meat or fat to season it.\" \"If I had meat or fat my food would not have lacked nour-ishment, but I have not had any for years. For seasoning, use nettles.\" \"In that case, we need some barley flour,\" they said. I replied, \"If I had flour my food would not have lacked sub-stance, but I have not had any for years. For flour, too, use nettles.\" \"Well then,\" they added, \"we cannot do without salt.\" I replied, \"If I had salt my food would not have lacked fla-vor, but I have not had any for years. For salt, use nettles.\" They said, \"Definitely, with your food and clothing, you will never improve your appearance or regain your strength. This is not becoming of a man. Even a servant has a full belly and warm clothes. There is no one in the world more miserable or pitiful than you.,· \"You shouldn't say such things,\" I replied. \"I am the most formidable of men to have obtained a human body. I have en-countered the likes of Lhodrak Marpa Lotsawa. I have received the oral instructions for attaining buddhahood in one life and one body. Having renounced this life, I am meditating alone in the mountains and devoting myself to achieving this enduring aim. I have sacrificed food, clothing, and conversation and in this life I shall defeat my enemies, the mental afflictions. For this reason, there is no one in the world more courageous or high-minded than me. On the other hand, although you have been born in a land where the Buddha's teachings have spread, you have no inclination even to listen to dharma let alone practice meditation. There is no form of ruinous behavior graver than piling up sinful deeds by the handful and the sackload. This is the way to land in the deepest and most enduring hell.

The hunters replied, \"You have said many fine things about happiness, and you certainly have a pleasing voice. But we can-not act in this manner of yours.\" With this, they went away. Each year in Kyangatsa a great festival was held for casting figurines. On this occasion the hunters, in a single voice, sang the Song of the Five Happinesses. My sister Peta was begging at the festival and heard them. \"Whoever spoke those words is a buddha,\" she cried."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"TSANGNY6N HERUKA One of the hunters said, \"Ha-ha, she is praising her own brother.\" Another added, \"Whether he is a buddha or an ordinary man, this is the song of your brother who is starving to death.\" Peta replied, \"My father and mother died long ago. Our rel-atives rose up against us as enemies. My brother has wandered to the ends of the earth, and I am a beggar who will never see him again. I have no reason to be cheerful.\" She began to weep and Dzese came up to her saying, \"Don't cry! It probably is your brother. I met him some time ago. Go to Drakar Taso and see if he's there. If he is, then we shall both go to meet him.\" She thought this was true, so she went to Drakar Taso carry-ing a vessel of beer she had begged and a small container of barley porridge. Then she peered in from the cave entrance. My body was wasted by ascetic practices. My eyes were sunken into their sockets. All my bones stuck out. I was emaciated with a green complexion. Fine bristling greenish hair grew on the skin hanging from my flesh and bones. The hair on my head grew in shocks and frightful disarray. My limbs were about to break. When my sister saw this she was terrified, thinking I was a ghost at first. But the words she had heard, that her brother was starving to death, made her hesitate. \"Are you a man or a ghost?\" she asked. \"I am Mila Topaga,\" I replied. Recognizing my voice, she came in and embraced me, cry-ing, .\"Brother, brother.\" In such a state, she fainted and lay un-conscious for a while. I too recognized that she was Peta and felt both happy and sad. I did my best to revive her and after a moment she regained consciousness. She placed her head be-tween my knees, covering her face with her hands. Choking with tears she said, \"Our mother died in misery while longing to see you brother. No one around us came to help, and unable to bear such intense grief in our house, I went to beg in other regions. I wondered if you were dead, my brother, or if you were not dead if you had found a measure of happiness greater than this.

I repeatedly tried to console her, to no avail. So, overcome with sadness, I sang this song to my sister: I pay homage to the lord lamas. Bless this beggar to stay in mountain retreat. Dear sister, a being tormented inside by life's round, In general, all pleasure and pain are ephemeral. But since you are feeling such pain in this way Be certain that lasting contentment exists. Listen, therefore, to your own brother's song. To repay the kindness of beings, my parents, Thus do I practice the dharma. Look at my home, like an animal's den. Were another to see it, he'd be stricken with grief. Look at my food, like an animal's fodder. Were another to see it, he'd feel sick to his stomach. Look at my body, like a skeletal frame. Were an enemy to see it, even he would shed tears. Look at my conduct, like that of a madman. My sister is filled with embarrassment. Look at my mind, an actual buddha. Were the Victors tosee it, they'd be filled with delight. Steadfast I kept until flesh and bone numbed, Set on the cold stone seat beneath me.

Therefore Peta, my sister dear, Without further misery and despair, Push on for the sake of the dharma. Peta replied, \"It would be amazing if what you say were so, but it seems difficult to believe it's true. If it were true then other religious practitioners would practice in this way, at least in part, even if not exactly as you do. But I have never seen anyone involved with such misery.\" I ate and drank the food and beer she gave me. Immediately my mind became crystal clear and that night my spiritual prac-tice improved. After Peta departed the next day, I felt both physical ease and discomfort, and various kinds of virtuous and non-virtuous thoughts arose in my mind, such as I had never experienced before. When this happened, I persevered in my meditation, but to no avail. Several days later, Dzese came to see me, together with Peta, carrying meat, pungent butter, barley flour, and a good amount of excellent beer. I had gone to fetch water when I met them. When they saw me without clothes and completely naked, they both blushed and could not help crying. They offered me the meat, butter, and barley flour, and poured the beer. While I was drinking, Peta said, \"However you look at my brother now, he cannot be called a man. You should beg for alms and eat at least some scrap of food fit for humans. I will give you what-ever I can collect to make clothes.\" \"Do whatever you can to go begging for food. I will also come to give you something to wear,\" added Dzese.

It seems that even greater misery would do so. Is there nothing you can do?\" I replied, \"The misery of the three lower realms is unimagin-ably worse than mine. Yet many are the beings who seek to experience such misery.

I found myself unable to meditate. I thought that there was no greater obstacle than my inability to meditate. I broke the seal to the scroll that the lama gave me and read its contents. Inside, it contained the heart-advice for transforming faults into positive qualities, quintessential points that remove obstacles and enhance one's practice. And it spe-cifically advised that I should ta~e good food at this time."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 147 I came to understand that through my previous-efforts in meditation, the subtle constituents were beginning to gather within the channels, but due to my poor diet they could not as-cend. Peta's beer allowed them to ascend a little bit and Dzese's offerings allowed them: to ascend completely. I worked hard to apply the key points regarding physical posture and subtle winds, as well as the visualizations contained in the scroll. As a result, the knots of the secondary channels were loosened, as was the knot in the lower part of the central channel at the level of the navel. Previously, I had understood the experience of bliss, clarity, and non-conceptuality through mere words. But now I devel-oped the extraordinary qualities of experience and realization that were extremely potent and stable and so not like that at all. Freed from impediments, I recognized faults as good qualities. The act of clinging to thoughts dawned as the reality body. Thus in general I understood all phenomena of life's round and transcendence to be interdependent. I further ascer-tained that the underlying basis of mind is free from biases. Life's round is the result of the path conditioned by wrong views. Transcendence is the result of the path conditioned by insight. The essence of both is emptiness and luminosity. In particular, I understood that the qualities that manifested· in my mind stream at that time arose through the interdependence of my previous meditation as the causal agent and the food and profound heart-advice as the conditioning agents.

I49 Thereafter I meditated with great perseverance. During the day, I had the experience that allowed me to display all sorts of miracles, such as transforming my body into any desired form and levitating in space. At night in my dreams I could freely il-luminate and wander through the entire universe from top to bottom. I could manifest many hundreds of mental and physical forms, with each one visiting a buddha realm and listening to the dharma as well as teaching dharma to countless sentient be-ings. I could perform unimaginable miracles, transforming my body into blazing fire, gushing water, and the like. Feeling joyful and encouraged by this, I continued to meditate and gained the ability to actually fly through the sky. Once I flew to Minkyiik Dripma Dzong, and while meditating there I developed the bliss-warmth of yogic heat far superior to what I had felt before. As I was flying back to Drakar Taso, I passed over a small village near Taso called Longda where a man and his son were plowing a field. The man was the brother of my uncle's daughter-in-law who had died under the collapse of my uncle's house. The son was leading the oxen while the father was guiding the plowshare and tilling the fields. The son saw me flying and cried, \"Father, look at this amazing sight! A man is flying!\" The father stopped working and, looking at me, said, \"What's so amazing about that? He's the son of the vile woman Nyangtsa Kargyen, that cunning Mila who has been worn down by starvation. Lead the oxen, but do not let his shadow fall upon you.\" The father kept moving his head and body, fear-ful that the shadow would touch him. But the son said, \"If a man can fly, cunning or not, there is no greater spectacle than that. So look, father.\" And the son continued looking at me. Afterward I reflected, \"Now if I work to benefit beings, I could actually help them. This is what I must do.\" At that time, my chosen deity revealed a prophecy stating, \"In this life, devote yourself wholly to practicing in accordance with the lama's instructions. There is no greater service to the Buddha's"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"150 TSANGNYON HERUKA teachings and no greater benefit to sentient beings than that.\" I understood that were I to fill my entire life with practice, it would serve as the best possible example for fortunate disciples in the future to renounce this life and practice dharma. And this would be of enormous benefit to the teachings and to sen-tient beings. Thus I resolved to practice. Then I thought, \"I have stayed in this place a long time and have bragged about the dharma to everyone who has shown up. More importantly, people have also seen me flying, a feat I gained through my experience and realization. Now I fear that if I stay here, my practice will face obstacles caused by people asking me to avert their worldly misfortunes and obtain things they want, just like the Son of the Gods Demon, I9 as well as by the eight worldly concerns. I should go to meditate at Chubar, which was prophesied by the lama.\" Placing on my back the clay pot in which I cooked nettles, I set out from Drakar Taso. My inferior food and clothing during this long period of practice caused my feet to become callused. I slipped on a stone at the entrance of my cave and fell. The handle of the pot fell off and the vessel rolled down the moun-tainside. I ran to catch it but the pot cracked and from within appeared a single mass of green _nettle residue· shaped just like the pot itself. This demonstrated that all composite things are impermanent and, reflecting on it, I understood it as an exhor-tation to practice. Feeling a sense of amazement and renuncia-tion, I sang this song: I once had a pot, now I do not. This case illustrates every composite thing. It exemplifies human bodies of leisure and opportunity. This being so, I Mila the yogin Will press on in my practice without distraction. This clay pot so important, the whole of my wealth, Becomes my lama in the moment it breaks, Teaching impermanence, how amazing! While I was singing, some hunters arrived and prepared their meal.

While I was eating, one young hunter said, \"You are a small-minded man. If you led a worldly life instead of living in such misery, you could ride a horse as fine as a young lion. You could wear the three kinds of weapons, sharp as thorns, and vanquish your bitter enemies. You could amass riches and pos-sessions and protect the friends who love you, which would make you happy.

So, arousing compassion for them, I stood up and s~id, \"My daughters, do not speak like that. You need not be so dis-tressed. You would not be reborn like me even if you prayed to do so. Your compassion is amazing, but conceit and compas-sion contradict each other. So listen to my song.\" Then I sang this song: To you, lord, compassionate one, I address my prayer. Grant your blessings, venerable Marpa. Sentient beings tormented by negative karma Show little regard for others, only themselves. Maidens with negative karma believe in their home life. Their bad airs and self-importance burn like fire. How pitiful, sentient beings whose minds are afflicted. In this dark period of the degenerate age Swindlers are worshipped like deities and gods, Charlatans are prized more than jewels and gold, The religious are tossed like pebbles on the road. How pitiful, ignorant sentient beings. You elegant maidens, each other's sisters, And I Milarepa of Gungtang Are repulsed, you by me, me by you. But we also feel pity, you for me, me for you.

She gave me seven conch-shell bracelets and they all offered prostrations and confessed their misdeeds. Then they requested a dharma instruction, and in response I sang this song: To the lord compassionate one I address my prayers. I shall teach authentic dharma in a brief verse.

Once or twice, people from Drin came to bring food and drink. I realized that this disturbed my concentration a little. I thought, \"I. have spent a long time in this location and my practice has flourished. But if people now begin to come around, it would impede my concentration. I should go to some isolated, empty valley. I should go to Lapchi in accordance with my lama's command.\" At that time Peta went to Drakar Taso, bringing with her some woolen cloth woven from wool and hair she had col-lected. Not finding me there~ she went looking for me, asking everyone. In Upper Gungtang she heard that a yogin, resem-bling a nettle worm, had left Palku going in the direction of Lato Lho. She left to come after me. In Dingri, she saw lama Bari Lotsawa seated on a throne, sheltered by parasols, and wearing fine silken robes. Disciples blew conch shells and a great crowd of people gathered around him, offering tea and beer, and many other kinds of gifts. Peta thought, \"These sorts of things are suitable for other religious practitioners. But my brother's dharma is nothing but misery, scorned by others, bringing only shame to his family. If I meet my brother, I must convince him to become this lama's servant.\" She questioned some of the men gathered there, who told her I was in Drin. She reached Drin and, after looking around, found me at Kyipuk. She said, \"My brother's dharma allows for nothing to eat or even clothes to wear. This makes me ashamed and embarrassed, and it's not right. Make a skirt from this woolen cloth. \"There is a lama named Bari Lotsawa who practices a differ-ent kind of dharma. He has a throne that supports him from below and parasols shelter him from above. In between he is draped in fine silks and plied with tea and beer.

You are embarrassed at my nakedness and my unconventional be-havior, but I am satisfied with what I have here. Since it allowed me to encounter the dharma, I am not ashamed of it. Moreover, I had it right from the time I was born, so I have nothing to be ashamed of. Those who break their parents' hearts, engaging in evil actions knowingly and without restraint; those who use the property of the lama and the three jewels; and those who harm sentient beings using all sorts of deceitful means in order to achieve their own desired ends-they harm themselves and oth-ers and displease the highest gods and humans. They are a cause for shame in both this life and the next. \"In particular, if you are ashamed of the body then you should be ashamed of your swelling breasts, which you did not have when you were born. You think that I forego food and clothing in my meditation due to a lack of material support, but that is not so. Generally speaking, I fear the suffering in the lower realms of life's round. I am as terrified as if I were being cast alive into flames. When I see people picking and choosing frivolity, distraction, and the eight worldly concerns, I feel re-vulsion like a vomiting sick man who is given food. I am as disturbed as if I were seeing the bloodstained hands that mur-dered my own father. This is why I have given them up. '~Moreover, Lhodrak Marpa gave me this prophetic com-mand: 'Abandon the frivolous distractions of the eight worldly concerns. Renounce food, clothing, and conversation. Wander in isolated places. And above all else, practice with a fierce in-tention to renounce this life.' So now I am following the com-mands of my lama. By doing so, I will not only bring about happiness in this life for those few people who have come into contact with me, I will also bring about everlasting happiness for all sentient beings, both myself and all others.

While she was away, I made a hood that covered my entire head, gloves for each of my fingers, boots for my feet, and a sheath for my penis. A few days later my sister returned and asked me, \"Brother, did you make some-thing with the woolen cloth?\" \"I did,\" I replied. Then I slipped each of the garments I had made onto my various appendages and showed them to her. \"Brother,\" she exclaimed, \"you are not human.

Everyone knows that our bodies are born male or female, And that we have organs to prove it. Those who guard against embarrassing and shameful activity Are not found among common people of the world.

I said, \"Until these provi-sions run out, stay here and avoid piling up sinful deeds even if you can't practice dharma.\" During this time, I explained as much as I could about the dharma instructions on the law of cause and effect of actions. She gained conviction in the dharma and began to lose her short temper. At about this time my uncle died, after which my aunt began to feel sincere remorse. Leading a crossbred yak loaded with provi-sions, she came looking for me all the way up to Drin. When she reached Drin, she left the crossbreed and most of the provisions there and then proceeded carrying as much as she could manage. Peta, who was standing on a hilltop, saw her and recognized that she was our aunt. She exclaimed, \"Our aunt has caused us and our mother so much suffering, so you shouldn't meet with her.\" Then she drew back the wooden bridge that led to the cave. Our aunt appeared at the edge of the bridge and said, \"Niece, do not draw back the bridge. Your aunt is here.\" \"That's exactly why I have drawn it back,\" replied Peta. \"You are right, my niece. But I am now filled with overwhelm-ing remorse. I have come to see you, brother and sister, so put back the bridge. If you won't do that, at least tell your brother that I have arrived.\" I, however, had climbed to the top of a rock on the near side of the bridge, where I was seated.

But first I must make her own up to her crimes.\" I said, \"In general, I have given up on relatives, but espe-cially my uncle and aunt. First, you inflicted misery on us.

I recognize her very great kindness. Even so, save for those who do dharma, I've no reason to meet even Dzese, And still less reason to meet my aunt. Return horne while it's still daylight. While it's still light, go away. When I finished, my aunt shed many tears and repeatedly prostrated herself. She said, \"My nephew has been right all along. I beg your forgiveness and sincerely confess my crimes. I fed terrible regret, now and into the future. It's because I have not lost all feelings for my family that I have come to see my nephew.

I taught her the law of cause and effect. Her mind turned toward the dharma and later she prac-ticed by meditating on the oral instructions. In this way, it is said, she became a self-liberated yoginf. At this point in the story, Zhiwa 0 said to the jetsiin, \"It is impossible to comprehend how the jetsiin expressed devotion for the lama when he requested dharma or persevered through meditation in the mountains once he received it. When we think about such actions it seems we are only pretending to practice dharma. We shall never be liberated from life's round. What can we do?\" Then he broke down in tears. The Jetsiin replied, \"If you consider the misery of life's round and of the lower realms, my devotion and perseverance do not seem so great. All dedicated individuals who hear the dharma teachings on cause and effect and develop conviction about them are capable of such perseverance. But those with no con-viction about the dharma do not understand it. They are un-able to renounce the eight worldly concerns, and adopt them instead. For this reason, conviction about the law of cause and effect is extremely important. Those who continually show signs that they lack conviction even about the obvious aspects of the law of cause and effect will find it difficult to develop an understanding of and conviction about the more subtle teach-ings on emptiness, even though explanations on emptiness are used in many examples of scripture and reasoning. After you have conviction about emptiness, you understand that empti-ness itself appears as the law of cause and effect. You then begin to exert yourself in virtuous practice, adopting and re-jecting various actions according to the law of cause and effect, and abandoning sinful deeds. This is the conviction that the law of cause and effect is the root of all dharma. Diligence and precision are therefore extremely important as you abandon sinful deeds and practice virtue. \"Although at first I did not comprehend the underlying truth"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"r66 TSANGNYON HERUICA of emptiness, I had conviction about the law of cause and ef-fect. For this reason, I was terrified at the thought that, having once performed such terrible negative deeds, I would be unable to avoid rebirth in the three lower realms. I became powerless to do anything but feel devotion toward my lama and perse-vere in meditation. \"Now, you must engage in the practice of Secret Mantra like this, in accordance with my advice. Find the strength to live alone in mountain retreat. I, an old man, shall bear you to lib-eration from life's round.\" Then Ngandzong Bodhiraja said, \"It seems that the precious Jetsiin is himself the great Vajradhara manifesting in human form and that he has displayed these actions for the benefit of sentient beings. Otherwise, it is certain that he is a great being of immeasurable fortune who has gathered the accumulations and attained the state of non-returning. The Jetsiin has all the requisite signs, such as 'giving up your life for the dharma' and 'great exertion in yoga.' If we ordinary people cannot even comprehend the manner in which the Jetsiin practiced aus-terities for the sake of dharma, the deeds he undertook with devotion while living with his lama and so forth, who could actually emulate them? Our bodies would not be able to toler-ate practicing that way. That is why it is certain that the Jetsiin was, from the start, either a buddha or a bodhisattva. Therefore, although I am incapable of practicing dharma, I believe that sentient beings will be liberated from life's round by seeing the Jetsiin's face and hearing his teachings. I beg the Jetsiin to tell us whether he is an emanation of Vajradhara or a bodhisattva.\" The Jetsiin replied, \"I have no idea whose emanation I am. But even were I an emanation from the three lower realms, if you regard me as Vajradhara or someone similar you will re-ceive his blessings by virtue of your devotion. Although this belief that I am an emanation comes from your pure percep-tion of me, there is no greater misunderstanding of dharma.

This will be di-vided into three broad cycles: a cycle on his binding under oath the non-humans that tormented him, a cycle on establishing his fortunate heart-disciples on the path of ripening and libera-tion, and a cycle on turning the wheel of various dharma in-structions for diverse lay disciples. To expand on these, first there is the way in which he bound non-humans under oath. At Drakmar Chonglung, he bound the King of Obstructors Vinayaka under oath and taught the cycle on the six recollections of the lama. Then, in order to carry out his lama's command, he went to Lapchi where he bound the great deity Gai].apati under oath and taught the in-structions recorded in the cycle on Lapchi Chuzang. The next year he traveled to the interior sanctuary of Lapchi and sang the widely known Great Song of the Snow Ranges. Then, in-tending to visit Riwo Pelbar in Mangyul and Yolmo Gangra in Nepal in order to carry out his lama's instructions, he again journeyed to Gungtang. Drawn to Lingwa Drak, he stayed there for a while and taught the demoness of Lingwa Drak. Then at Ragma Changchup Dzong on the side of Riwo Pelbar he taught the instructions recorded in the cycle on binding under oath the earth goddess and the local spirit of Ragma. Next, he stayed at Kyangpen Namkha Dzong, where he bene-fited numerous humans and non-humans. Then he traveled to Yolmo Gangra and stayed at Takpuk Senge Dzong in the dense"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"172 TSANGNYON HERUKA forest of Singala. There too he benefited a number of humans and non-humans. Then he had a vision exhorting him to ben-efit beings by returning to Tibet and meditating in mountain retreats and other isolated places. Accordingly, he traveled to Tibet and stayed at a cave in Kutang where he taught the in-structions recorded in the cycle on the pigeon. Second are the cycles regarding how he met his heart-disciples. Next, he stayed at Drakya Dorje Dzong, where he benefited many sentient beings. During that period, the lady Vajrayogini\" predicted in a general way how the Jetsiin would meet his disci-ples. In particular, she prophesied Rechungpa Dorje Drakpa, the disciple who would receive the oral instructions of the qakin'i aural transmission, as well as the location of their meeting. Accordingly, while residing in Zaok Puk at the upper end of Rala in Gungtang, he met his heart-son Rechungpa. Later, Rechungpa went to India in order to cure an illness and the master and dis-ciple met once again. At Osal Puk in the upper end of Ron he met Tsapu Repa. Then he went to Changchup Dzong in Ragma where he met Repa Sangye Kyap. Afterward, while staying at Dro Puk, he gave Kyoton SakyaguQ.a, who was already a devotee, initiation and oral in-structions and thus established him on the path of ripening and liberation. Later, while traveling on his way out to Tago in Chang, he met his female disciple Peldar Bum at Gepalesum in Chung. On his return, he met Seban Repa at a guesthouse in Yeru Chang. Then, when he went to meditate at Gyalgi Sri\" in Lato, he met Drigom Repa. Having gone to beg alms during autumn, he met Repa Zhiwa 0 at Ngulbum Spring. Then in Chimlung he met Ngandzong Repa as recounted in the cycle on the walk-ing staff. . Then, while staying in Lapchi, 4akin'is urged him to carry out the lama's prophetic command, and while on the road to Tise he met Dampa Gyakpu. On his way up, he met Kharchung Repa as recounted in the cycle on the Kore Mountain Pass of Lowo. Then, while spending the winter on the glacial foothills of Dritse in the valley of Purang, he met Darma Wangchuk. In the spring, he departed for Tise and overpowered Naro Bonchung through"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 173 a display of miracles, recounted in the cycle on Tisi. On his re-turn he again stayed at Drakya Dorje Dzong, where he met Rongchung Repa. Then, urged on by the qakin'is, he found Bepuk Mamo Dzong. Staying there for a few days, he encountered a shep-herd who followed him and later became an excellent realized master known as Lukdzi Repa. Then at Lapuk Perna Dzong he met Shengom Repa. Later, he rendered service and the most excellent offerings to the master when he stayed at Bepuk Mamo Dzong and Langgo Ludii Dzong. Then he met Rechungpa, as recounted in the cycle on travel-ing through Choro Dritsam. Then, while staying at Nyishang Gurta in Mon, he met Khyira Repa. It was on his account that the Jetsiin's great fame spread throughout Nepal. Tara then revealed a prophecy, and at her prompting, the King of Khokhom presented offerings to the master. At the invitation of Rechungpa and Shengom Repa, he then stayed at Nyanyon Puk in the lowlands of Lapchi. The follow-ing year he stayed at Chonglung Drak. Then traveling to Chubar, he taught the instructions recorded in the three succes-sive cycles on Tseringma. Next, when he went to Drin Dingma he met Repa Dorje Wangchuk. Then, while the master and dis-ciples were staying at Dro Puk of Nyanam, he met the Indian Dharmabodhi at Balpo Dzong, who prostrated before the Jetsiin. This increased the master's fame and respect, on ac-count of which Tonpa Dado became jealous and challenged him to a debate, recorded in the cycle on his refutation through the display of miraculous power and authority. This led to the accounts recorded in the cycle on Rechung and Tipu. During this time, he met Megom Repa at Dro Puk. At Nagtra in Nyanam he met Rema Sale 0. Then the Jetsiin went to Drakmar Poto. While staying there, he saw Rechungpa returning from India and went to greet him, recorded in the cycle on the yak horn and the cycle on the Song of Wild Asses. Then he traveled to Chubar, where he met Lengom Repa of Dakpo."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"174 TSANGNYON HERUKA At Trode Tashigang in Drin he met the incomparable Dakpo Lharje, the great being foretold by the previous buddhas, the most excellent heart-disciple, the monk, vajra-holder, and great heroic bodhisattva Dawo Zhonu, who took birth in human form in order to benefit beings. Then, while staying at Omchung in Drin, he met Loton Gendiin, who first opposed him and later became his follower. Then, while staying at Kyipuk Nyima Dzong, he met Dreton Tashibar of Drin. While engaging in yogic behavior he met Likor Charu, one among a group of monks, who followed him as an attendant. Qakinzs prophesied that the precious Jetslin would have twenty-five adepts among his human disciples. These are the eight heart-sons, the thirteen close-sons, and the four sis-ters. There are extensive cycles regarding how the master met each one. Third are the various cycles of story fragments. He described how he met his heart-sons in a number of inner and secret for-tresses but did not tell the order in which they occurred. There are several cycles on answers to questions of resident disciples and lay followers. There is a cycle on Bonpori that occurred while Gampopa was staying with him. Then there is the cycle on initiation and consecration when he went to Nyanam. There is· the cycle on Shendormo and Lekse Bum at Tsarma, and then the cycle on the importance of remaining joyful at the time of death. There is the cycle on Dlidiil Pukmoche and the cycle on taking a stroll when the master and Rechungpa went to Lapchi. Then, having returned, there is the cycle on Ramding Nampukma. Then, while staying at Dro Puk of Nyanam at the invitation of lay followers, the Jetslin narrated his life storj. Following that, there is the cycle on Rechungpa's departure for 0. There is the cycle on his meeting with Dampa on the Tong Pass at the insistence of the 4akinz Senge Dongchen. There is the cycle on the iron hook of compassion for the dead and re-paying the kindness of his mother at Lezhing. There is the cycle on his final testament given to lay followers of Tsarma and other people of Nyanam. Then there is the cycle on Lharje Yangnge at Tingri that occurred while on his way to Chubar."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 175 Then there is the cycle on Rechungpa's second departure forD, after the Jetsiin reached Chubar. There is the cycle on the pa-tron Tashi Tsek at Lhadro in Drin. There is the cycle on his lay followers such as Dzese Bum and Khuchuk at Drakar in Drin. There is the cycle on his victory over the four demons at Drakmar Poto and the answers to questions of a mantra prac-titioner. There is the cycle on how he displayed bodily miracles to the delight of his disciples. There are an unimaginable number of such cycles, both well known and little known, in which he turns the wheel of dharma. In this way, he ripened and liberated those of highest capacity, beings with untold great fortune. He ripened and taught the path of liberation to those of intermediate capacity. Those of least capacity he imbued with the firm intention to train in the practice of arousing the attitude of supreme awakening and in the bodhisattva discipline. Even those lacking fortune alto-gether he imprinted with the inclination toward real virtue. Thus he performed the enlightened activity of establishing them in the happiness of the gods and humans in the higher realms. With compassion as vast as space, he illuminated the teachings of the Buddha and protected sentient beings from life's round and the lower realms' myriad sufferings. These are described at great length in the context of The Hundred Thousand Songs. This was the eighth of the supreme deeds, the deed of benefit-ing the teachings and sentient beings through the results of his practice."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE Finally, all these activities had been carried out. At that time, there lived in Drin Dingma a wealthy and arrogant teacher named Geshe Tsakpuwa. He always sat at the head of the row when villagers from Drin held ritual assemblies. He pretended to show respect to the Jetsiin but, overcome with jealousy, he decided to humiliate the master before his assembled patrons. To do this, he pretended to be troubled by doubts and asked many questions. During the first autumn month of the wood-tiger year, the Jetsiin was invited to sit at the head of the assembly row during a large wedding celebration in Drin. Geshe Tsakpuwa was also there, but was seated farther down the line. He prostrated to the Jetsiin, hoping that the prostrations would be. returned in front of the assembled crowd. The Jetsiin had never bowed to anyone except his own lama, nor had he ever returned anyone's prostration. Following this custom, he did not return the Geshe's prostrations. The Geshe thought, \"A fine scholar as qualified and learned as myself bowing before a know-nothing fool such as him, and not receiving prostrations in return! I will humiliate him!\" He took out a treatise on logic and said, \"Jetsiin, in order to clear up the doubts I have about this text, please give a dis-course providing both a close reading of the text and an inter-pretation of its supplementary points.\" The Jetsiin replied, \"You know very well how to give close readings of the words found in treatises. But a close reading of the underlying meaning requires eradicating clinging to the sense of self of individuals by developing equanimity and renouncing"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"TSANGNYON HERUKA the eight worldly concerns, and then eradicating clinging to the sense of self of phenomena by recognizing the equal taste of life's round and transcendence. All of which is gained solely through meditating in the mountains. Apart from that, I have no use for saying this is a response to that word or this logically follows from that-none of which involves practice. I have never studied such things. I know nothing about them. And even if I did, I have forgotten it. Listen to my song of why this is so.\" Then he sang this song: I bow at the feet of the translator Marpa. Bless me to shun the conventional. The lama's blessings penetrated my mind And my mind never strayed, never veered from the dharma. Again and again I meditated on love and compassion And forgot about clinging to self and others. Again and again I meditated with the lama on the crown of my head And forgot about arrogant leaders. Again and again I meditated never leaving my chosen deity And forgot my inferior body. Again and again I meditated on the aural transmission instructions And forgot about scriptures in writing. Again and again I nurtured ordinary mind And forgot about ignorance and confusion. Again and again I meditated on the intrinsic three bodies And forgot about fostering hopes and fears. Again and again I meditated on this life and the next as equal And forgot about fear of birth and death."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MlLAREPA Again and again I nurtured experience in solitude And forgot about pleasing family and friends. Again and again I absorbed experience in my mind stream And forgot about philosophical positions. Again and again I meditated on no-arising, -ceasing, or -abiding And forgot about views to be asserted. Again and again I recognized appearances as reality body And forgot about referential meditation. Again and again I rested in an uncontrived natural state And forgot about superficial activity. Again and again I kept myself humble in body and speech And forgot about the pride of great men. Again and again I used the temple in my illusory body And forgot about community temples. Again and again I practiced with no concern for words And forgot about literal meanings. Let scholars give literal readings of texts. 179 The Geshe replied, \"The tradition of meditators may be as you describe it, but if I were to pursue the matter using logical reason-ing, your dharma talk would lead nowhere. I had hoped that the Jetsiin was a good man, which is why I prostrated before him.\" The patrons found this unacceptable and in agreement they said, \"Master Geshe, however learned you may be in the dharma, the world is filled with religious people like you. You are not equal to even a single pore on the Jetsiin's body. So take a seat at the head of our assembly and quiet down. Do what you can to in-~:n.·ase your wealth.

His face turned dark and he thought, \"Milarepa, who acts like a know-nothing madman with his nonsense, his lies, and deceit, is a disgrace to the teach-ings. He confuses people and then lives off their charity. But although I have such extensive learning and am the wealthiest and most influential man in the region, in religious matters I am not even respected as much as a dog. I must do something about this.\" The Geshe had a lover. He gave her a large turquoise and then sent her to deliver some poisoned curds to the Jetsi.in, who was at the time staying at Drakar in Drin. The Jetsi.in knew that he had established his fortunate disciples, those with whom he had karmic connections, on the path of ripening and libera-tion, and that even without the woman's poisoned food the time for him to die had arrived. He also knew that if she did not acquire the turquoise before he took the poison, she would never obtain it. So he said to her, \"I shall not eat your food of-fering just yet. Bring it back later and then I shall eat it.\" The woman wondered if the Jetsi.in suspected her so she re-turned, frightened and filled with shame. To Geshe Tsakpuwa she said, \"With his clairvoyance, the Jetsi.in knew about our plan and would not take the poisoned food.\" When she reported what had happened, the Geshe replied, \"If he was really clairvoyant, he would not have told you to bring it back later. He would have given it to you and forced you to eat it. The fact that he did not do this but only said to bri~g it back later is a sign that he is not clairvoyant. Now, take this turquoise and be certain that he eats the poison.\" He gave her the turquoise but she said, \"Everyone is con-vinced that he is clairvoyant. I am certain of it. It is because he knew what was happening that he did not eat the poisoned foe>d yesterday, and he will not eat it today. I don't need the turquoise. I am too afraid and will not do it. I won't go.\" \"Laymen believe he is clairvoyant,\" the Geshe replied, \"be-cause they have not read the scriptures and have been fooled by his deceptions. In my scriptures it is taught that clairvoyant men are not like him. I am certain he is not clairvoyant. Now,"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA x8x give him the food, and once I have seen proof we shall be mar-ried.

We are now united in this scheme, so do your best.\" Hoping these promises were real and that they would be ful-filled, she mixed the poison with some curds and brought them to the Jetsiin while he was staying at Drode Tashigang. The Jetsiin smiled and then took them in his hands. \"Geshe Tsakpuwa was right, he does not seem to be clairvoyant,\" thought the woman. At that moment, the Jetsiin said, \"Did you receive the tur-quoise as a gift for the deed you are performing?\" Terrified and ashamed, the woman prostrated herself and in a trembling voice choked with tears said, \"I did receive the turquoise. But please do not eat this. Give it back to me, who was intending to do you harm.\" \"What will you do with it?\" \"I will eat it myself since I am such a wicked person.\" The Jetsiin said, \"First of all, my compassion is such that I could not bear to hand it over for you to eat. It would violate my training in the aspiration to enlightenment and would con-stitute a root infraction of my vows. More importantly, my opportunity to train disciples and my life span have both come to an end. It is now time to depart for another realm. Your food will not harm me so it does not matter whether I eat it or not. Had I eaten it the first time, you would not have received the turquoise as payment for your crime. That is why I did not take it. Now that the turquoise is in your hands, I will eat it in order to fulfill the Geshe's intentions and to ensure that you can keep the turquoise. \"The Geshe promised many things for you both once you carried this out, but your hopes will not be fulfilled.

So keep them in mind and see if they are true.\" Having said this, he ate the poison. The woman then repeated this to Geshe Tsakpuwa, who said, \"Not all that is said is true. Not all that is cooked is edi-ble. It is enough for me that he has taken the poison. Now re-member to keep quiet about it.'' Meanwhile, the Jetsiin announced, \"Those faithful patrons who have a connection with me, headed by the people ofNyanam and Dingri, come see me and bring supplies for a ritual feast. Those from the surrounding area who have not met me but wish to do so should also come.\" His disciples spread this proclama-tion, although most people who heard it did not believe they were the Jetsiin's own words. But faithful male and female disci-ples who had a previous dharma connection, and many fortunate individuals who desired to meet him, gathered at Chubar. For many days, the Jetsiin gave instructions of provisional meaning on the law of cause and effect as well as instructions of definitive meaning introducing the quintessential truth. During this time, some fortunate disciples seated in the audi-ence clearly saw the sky filled with gods listening to the dharma. Others perceived that the earth and sky were entirely filled with gods and humans listening to the dharma and were thus filled with joy. Everyone plainly saw the pristine sky filled with extraordinary signs: a canopy of rainbow light, parasols and victory banners made of five-colored clouds, and innumerable other offerings. A rain of five-colored flowers descended. They heard sweet sounds of beautiful music and smelled delightful scents such as they had never experienced before."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA Perceiving such wondrous signs, those in the audience of in-termediate ability asked the Jetsiin, \"We have the joyful feeling that the earth and sky are entirely filled with gods and humans listening to the dharma, and we have directly witnessed such wondrous signs.

Jetsiin replied, \"Among you human followers of the dharma, apart from yogins who have attained the bodhisattva levels and fortunate lay followers, capable individuals are few in number. But virtuous gods have gathered to listen to the dharma, filling all of space, and present to me divine substances that are offerings of the five sense pleasures, which likewise fill you humans with a sense of well-being. This is the reason that you both sense and directly witness such wondrous signs.\" \"What then is the reason that some of us do not see these signs?\" \"There are many among the gods who have attained the state of non-returning and the bodhisattva levels. To see them requires an extrasensory physical eye. Lacking that, one needs at least a fierce yearning for the two accumulations and a wear-ing down of the mental imprints left by the two types of obscu-ration. If you can see the principal gods, who have attained the bodhisattva levels, then you will also be able to see their reti-nues. So if you wish to see the gods, strive to gather the accu-mulations and purify obscurations.

You all should go and offer fine prayers and then we shall meet in a pure celestial realm.\" The villagers then requested, \"Although the Jetsiin will not come now, may he bless with good fortune the places he vis-ited. May he also offer a special prayer for all sentient beings, especially those who have seen his face, heard his name and teachings, or have some other connection with him.\" The Jetsiin replied, \"Your giving me provisions out of devo-tion is a great kindness.

When all those in the assembly had each returned horne, the rainbow lights and other signs in the sky likewise disappeared. Then the people of Orin called upon Zhiwa 0 and other in-fluential heart-disciples to request the Jetsiin's presence. To sup-press a serpent spirit in Orin named Dolpa Nakpo, the Jetsiin stayed in a retreat cave constructed at the top of a flat rock called Rekpa Diikchen, which was shaped like the hood of a snake. He taught the dharma to his patrons in Drin. Then at last the Jetsiin said, \"Resident disciples, if you need to clarify any misconceptions regarding my oral instructions, do so quickly. I do not know if I will linger for very long.\" The resident disciples conducted a ritual feast and then re-quested the oral instructions in their entirety. From the assembly-row Origorn and Seban said, \"Judging from what the Jetsiin has said, we do n9t believe that he will soon pass into the state of transcendence.

We will also perform a longevity ceremony and medical treatments.\" He then called the patrons and began making preparations for the rituals. But the Jetsiin said, \"For a yogin, illness is basically nothing more than an inspiration to spiritual practice.

But to perform a ritual of profound Secret Mantra for the purposes of this life without arousing the en-lightened attitude for the benefit of beings would be an offense against the wisdom deities, similar to asking a king to step down from his throne to sweep the floor. You must never per-form rituals of profound Secret Mantra solely for your own aims in this life, although ordinary folk show no regret for doing so. I continuously performed rites of Secret Mantra in isolated retreats for the benefit of all sentient beings. These are proper rituals. As a result, my mind does not waver from the seat of reality itself. This is the proper longevity ceremony. Marpa's medical treatments eradicated illness of the five poi-sons from its root. These too are proper medical treatments. \"However, for dharma practitioners like you who are unable to adopt negative circumstances as part of the path, if your time has not come and circumstances obstruct your practice toward enlightenment, then it is permissible to take medical remedies or to perform rituals. This is a period in which temporary circumstances may be averted by the great power of dependent origination and be transformed into good qualities. \"It was with just these sorts of less advanced disciples in mind that the Blessed One showed his hand for diagnosis to the physician Kumara and took medicine. As the time had come for him to perform such activities, the Buddha then dem-onstrated the act of passing into transcendence. Now my time has also come, so I will not give permission to give medicine or perform rituals.\" Then the two repa disciples said, \"If it is certain that thl' Jetsiin will depart in order to benefit others, please give us dis-ciples advice on how we should venerate your corpse, how we should make clay figurines and build a stupa, who should man-"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA 191 age your religious seats, how we should perform you-r memori-als, and how we should practice listening, contemplation, and meditation.\" The Jetsiin said, \"Through the kindness of gracious Marpa I exhausted all deeds of life's round and transcendence. It is un-certain that a yogin whose three gates have been liberated in the very nature of things will leave a corpse. There is no need to make clay figurines or to build a stupa. I have no monastery of my own so there is no need to establish a religious seat. Keeping to uninhabited and isolated places such as rocky and snow-covered mountains, you all should lovingly protect dis-ciples, the six types of sentient beings. Do not slack in produc-ing figurines, the four-session yoga. Atop the stupa of all phenomena, erect a victory banner of accomplishment in the training of sacred outlook. For a memorial, pray sincerely in word and thought from the depths of your heart. For a system of practice, reject that which increases ego clinging and afflic-tions, and harms sentient beings even if it appears to be virtu-ous. Practice that which serves as an antidote for the five poisons and benefits sentient beings, even if it appears to be sinful, be-cause it is in essence authentic dharma. \"If, after hearing this, you disregard it and fail to practice, then your learning, however great it may be, is an obstruction that will cast you into the depths of the lower realms. Therefore, since life is short and the time of death is uncertain, devote yourself to meditation. Practice virtue and reject sinful deeds as best you know how, even at the cost of your own life. The meaning of this can be summed up as follows: act in such a way that you will not be ashamed of yourself. Do this and even if your actions contradict the letter of some texts they will not contradict the intentions of the previous Victors. Collected here is their understanding of all aspects of study and contem-plation, and through them the intentions of this old man will be fulfilled. If my intentions are fulfilled, all your actions of I i fe 's round and transcendence will come to an end. On the other hand, any means for fulfilling worldly intentions are of no use at all.

Then, when the Jetsiin began to show signs of increasing illness, Geshe Tsakpuwa made a show of bringing him offerings of meat and beer, and pretended to inquire about his health. The Geshe said, \"It is a pity that an accomplished master such as the Jetsiin was afflicted by this kind of illness. If there was a way to share it, you could divide it among your disciples. If there was a way to transfer it, you could give it to a person like me. But there is no way to do that. What should be done now?\" The Jetsiin smiled and said, \"It should be clear to you that, while there was no reason for this illness to afflict me, I could not avoid it. Generally speaking, illness for an ordinary person is not like illness for a dharma practitioner, who should trea-sure it as an opportunity to practice. And in my case, I wear my illness as an ornament.\" Then he sang this song: Life's round and transcendence, clear in luminosity's sphere, Are held in the hand of their natural place And imprinted with the Great Seal's mark. I thus have the greatness of non-duality, And the courage unhindered by obstacles. Illness, affliction, sins, and obstructions-A yogin, I flaunt them as ornaments. They abide as channels, subtle winds, and drops, And adorn my major and minor marks, generosity and the rest. May they purify the sins of ill will.

Although he has reason to transfer his illness, I am sure he cannot.\" Then he said, \"If only I knew the reason for the Jetsiin's illness. If it were a benign or malicious demon I would exorcise it.

Watch.\" When Milarepa transferred it to the door of his retreat cell there was a loud crash as it shuddered and splin-tered. And at that moment, the Jetsiin rested without illness. The Geshe wondered if it was a magic trick and said, \"How amazing. Now transfer it to me.\" \"Very well, I will give the Geshe a taste,\" replied Milarepa, and he withdrew the illness from the door and transferred it to Tsakpuwa, who collapsed in pain. Paralyzed and gasping for air, he lay there barely conscious and on the verge of death. The Jets tin then took back most of the illness and said, \"I trans-ferred only half of my illness. Can you not even withstand that?\" Having experienced such pain, the Geshe was filled with an intense, unbearable feeling of regret. He placed the Jetsiin's feet on his head and as he wept tears of heartfelt emotion he cried, \"Precious Jetsiin, genuine master, just as you said, it was l-east under a spell-who caused the illness. I offer all of my inner and outer possessions together with my house to the Jetsiin.

Then he said, \"Throughout my life I have had no need for house or wealth. And now on the verge of death, I still have no need for them, so take back your offerings.

The sinful actions I carried out in the past were for the sake of my house and wealth. But I no longer have use for my house and fields, or my wealth.

Later, the disciples used them as offerings to establish an annual memorial service for the Jetsiin, a practice that is still performed at Chubar today. Eventually, Geshe Tsakpuwa too re-nounced this life and became an excellent dharma practitioner. Then the Jetsiin said, \"It was necessary for me to stay in this place so that a terrible sinner could express his regret and thus be released from his sinful deeds. For a meditator like me to die in a village would be like a king dying in a commoner's house.

Another Jetsiin departed in the com-pany of the senior resident disciples. Yet another Jetsiin dis-played the appearance of illness seated upon the flat rock Rekpa Diikchen. Another was attended by faithful disciples who came to see him later at Chubar. Another Jetsiin taught the dharma seated at Drakar to patrons from Dingma who had gathered outside, while individual Jetsiins appeared inside the homes of each resident in order to receive their respects. Those who had gone on ahead to Chubar said, \"The Jetsiin has reached Chubar before us.\" The senior disciples said, \"He was accompanied by us on the journey.\" Each person who arrived later said that he had ac-companied the Jetsiin during the trip. One person said, \"He is staying in my house.\" Those who had listened to his dharma teachings said, \"On that day he was in Drakar teaching dharma.\" Each person who had paid his respects likewise said, \"On that day I invited him to my home to pay my respects.\" As they all had different stories and could not agree upon"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"TSANGNY6N HERUKA what had happened, they asked the Jetsiin, who replied, \"All of you are correct.

During this time, the signs that had appeared previously while he was teaching the dharma, such as rainbow light, filled the entire sky, the mountain peaks, and the valleys of Chubar. Everyone was then certain that the Jetsiin would depart for another realm. Repa Zhiwa 0, Ngandzong Repa, and Seban Repa asked, \"To which realm does the Jetsiin intend to go? Where should we direct our prayers? What are the final instructions that you said you had to give us? Please offer us advice on how we all should practice.\" The Jetsiin replied, \"Pray wherever you are inclined to do so. If you pray with faith and devotion, no matter where you are, I will be there before you. Pray sincerely and I will grant what-ever it is you wish. In a moment, I must depart to meet the Blessed One Ak~obhya in the land of Abhirati. Here is the final testament I said I would give: After I have died, of my posses-sions that you know about, give this staff and these robes to Rechungpa who will reach here soon. They will create a posi-tive connection for his meditation on the subtle winds. Do not touch my corpse until Rechungpa arrives.

These are nothing of great value, but they each will cre-ate a positive connection. \"Now here is the main part of my testament regarding the possessions no one knows about, but which should be told to my resident disciples, lay followers, and all other fortunate individuals.

Thus having reached his eighty-fourth year, at sunrise on the fourteenth day of the last winter month of the wood-hare year, under the constellation Ashlesha, the great Jetsiin demonstrated the act of dissolving his physical body into the sphere of reality. At that time, signs that the gods and qakinis had gath-ered were even more widespread and wondrous than before. Everyone looking into the clear sky perceived what seemed to be a checkered pattern drawn with rainbow lights. In the center of each square was a multicolored eight-petaled lotus flower in which the petals of the four cardinal directions were the four principal colors. Upon each lotus flower stood a mandala even more beautiful and marvelous than those designed or painted by skilled artisans.

Melodious songs of praise set to pleasing music and the fragrant scent of finest incense permeated the air. Everyone spread out across the ground witnessed such things. Many people saw gods and qakinis bearing numerous welcome gifts and then offering them. Humans did not look upon the naked bodies of the gods as improper, and the gods were not affected by the unpleasant odor of the humans. Humans and divine beings conversed among themselves and entertained each other. These marvelous signs continued until the funerary rites were completed. At this point, patrons from Nyanam heard news of the Jetsiin's death and went to Chubar, where they demanded that the senior heart-disciples and patrons from Drin allow the corpse to be transported to Nyanam. The patrons from Drin refused and began preparations for the cremation. The men from Nyanam said, \"In that case, postpone the cremation until all the patrons from Nyanam have come to view the corpse.\" Then they quickly departed for home, and returned with a band of men to fight for the body. The senior disciples attempted to settle the dispute, saying, \"The patrons from Nyanam and Drin are all equally devoted to the Jetsiin. However, since he died at Chubar, it is not proper that the corpse be transported to Nyanam. The people of Nyanam should remain here until the body is cremated. Then the relics will be evenly distributed to everyone.\" B4t the men of Nyanam thought their forces were greater. As they prepared to fight, a divine youth appeared in the sky at the center of a halo of rainbow light and, in the Jetsiin's own voice, sang this song: 0 students and patrons assembled here Quarreling over this corpse: Listen to my proclamation.

Overjoyed at the thought that they had seen the Jetsiin, the lay followers set aside their dispute and prayed to him. The senior disciples and the inhabitants of Drin no longer thought that the corpse would be taken away from them. But at the same time, the people of Nyanam believed that they had obtained the corpse, which they cremated upon the spot called Garuc~a Egg at the great Diidiil Puk in Lapchi. Signs such as canopies of rainbow light, a rain of flowers, beautiful fragrances, and pleasing music all appeared, exactly as they had at Chubar. Meanwhile, the heart-disciples and lay followers prayed over the corpse at Drin. When six days had passed, they examined the body and found that it had taken the form of an eight-year-old youth, radiant with light like the countenance of a divine child. The senior heart-disciples discussed the matter and de-cided that Jetsiin Rechungpa was not coming. They agreed that if the corpse were left any longer, they would risk being left with no physical relics to serve as a basis for their offerings and prayers. It would therefore be best to perform the cremation right away.

In this state he had a vision that, at Chubar, 4akinis held aloft a crystal stupa filling the sky with light and prepared to transport it to a pure realm. The ground was filled with people, headed by his vajra brothers and sisters and the Jets4n's patrons, and the sky was filled with gods and 4akinis, all of whom were singing melodies and presenting an inconceiv-able array of offerings. As Rechungpa likewise offered prostrations to the stupa, the Jetsiin leaned out from within the chamber and said, \"Rechungpa my son, although you did not come when I called you, I am delighted that father and son have met in this way. I do not know if we shall meet many more times, so let us appreciate the rarity of this meeting and talk.\" He repeatedly caressed Rechungpa's head and expressed his pleasure. Rechungpa thus understood the rarity of their encounter and was filled with a sense of devotion he had never felt before."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF MILAREPA Then Rechungpa awoke. He recalled what the lama had said and wondered if he might already have passed away.

Go now.\" The sky then filled with rainbow light and, inspired by this vision, he felt a great longing for the lama. \"I must leave at once,\" he thought, and then he departed just as the cocks of Lorodol were crowing. Within a state of deep devotion toward his master, he took control of the subtle winds and departed to meet the lama like an arrow shot by a master archer. Thus in a single morning he covered the distance a traveler riding a don-key would take two months to traverse. He reached the sum-mit of Poze Pass on the border between Dingii and Drin just as the sun was rising. As he rested there for a while, he saw an expansive display of wonderful signs permeating the sky, the mountaintops, and the valleys below. These filled him with both joy and sorrow at the same time. On the summit of Jowo Razang there was a tent made from clouds of rainbow light. Inside were countless divine youths, male and female, bearing offerings pleasing to the five senses, bowing their heads and making prostrations in the direction of Chubar, and intoning prayers. This filled Jetsiin Rechungpa with apprehension and he asked divine beings, \"What is the significance of these wonderful signs, and to whom are you presenting these offerings?\" Several of the goddesses replied, \"Have you been hiding with your eyes and ears closed? All these signs are the virtuous ce-lestial beings presenting offerings to the most sublime object of worship for all gods and humans anywhere in the world, Mila Zhepa Dorje, who has departed for a pure celestial realm.

Rechungpa thought, \"It is not true that the Jetsiin has died,\" and overjoyed, he touched the lama's feet to his head and performed prostrations, while the lama answered all of his questions. Then the Jetsiin said, \"Rechungpa my son, come follow me. I will get ready to welcome you.\" He went on ahead and in an instant was gone. Rechungpa continued along the path. When he reached Chubar he saw the resident disciples, students, and lay follow-ers assembled at the Jetsiin's cave, presenting offerings to the corpse in a deep state of grief. Several young repas who did not recognize Rechungpa prevented him from approaching the body. Anguished by this, he sang to the lama this song of the sevenfold worshipin a sorrowful melody: Lord, three-times buddhas, protector of beings, From the depths of your great compassion and wisdom Listen please to these lamentations Of me, your unfortunate servant, Rechung Dordrak.

Rechungpa was captivated by this spectacle, but then thought the qakin'is might be carrying away the remains and relics. As he went over to the cell, the qakin\"is flew off into the sky. He roused his vajra brethren and fellow practitioners. When they peered into the cremation chamber, they found ev-erything had been swept away so that not even a trace of ash remained.

These were his human disciples. There were also innumerable non-human dis-ciples, such as the Tsering Chenga sisters and the demon of Lingwa Drak, who were protectors of the virtuous. When the funeral rites were completed, all the disciples who were present at the time of the Jetsiin's death then departed in the ten directions, each for his or her own isolated mountain retreat. Thereafter they dedicated their lives to practice. Rechungpa took Dakpo Rinpoche's share of the lama's possessions and once again set out for D province. Although Gampopa was a little late, he remembered the lama's instructions and was on his way to Chubar when they met in Yarlung Pushar. Rechungpa handed over Maitripa's hat and the aloe wood staff to Gampopa and then told him what had transpired. Gampopa fell unconscious for a spell and when he revived he called out many grief-stricken prayers to the lama. This is described in his own biography. Gampopa invited Rechungpa' to his residence and received from him the dharma cycles of the Cakrasan:zvara aural trans-mission in their entirety. Rechungpa gave these dharma trans-missions and a portion of the lama's robe, and then left for the hermitage at Lorodol where he remained. Eventually, his body departed for the celestial realms. The heart-sons Zhiwa 0 and Khyira Repa, and the female disciples Rechungma, Peldar Bum, and Sale 0 likewise had their bodies depart for the celestial realms. The others displayed the act of passing away in the usual manner, after which they departed for the celestial realms. The heart-sons were marvelous and amazing in the way their bodies departed for the celestial realms in this very life. Those who displayed the act of passing away in the usual manner left remains and relics. The excellent results of these enlightened activities brought benefits as vast as the ex-panse of space to both the teachings and sentient beings.

See eight forms of mastery in the glossary. 3· E ma ho A Tibetan exclamation of wonder and amazement. 4· \"Mila! Mila!\" An exclamation of both fright and awe, here serv-ing as a statement of submission, not unlike crying \"uncle.\" 5· Trepe Tenchung (pre/bre pe stan chung) According to the cur-rent inhabitants of the region, trepe ten (prelbre pe stan) refers to the sole of a boot. The field was so named due to its shape. 6. crossbred yaks In Tibetan, dzo (mdzo), a domesticated animal resulting from the crossbreeding of a yak (or its female counter-part, known as a dri ['bri]) and a cow or bull. Dzo, and the fe-male dzomo (mdzo mo), are common throughout Tibet, and are valued for their sturdiness, strength as pack and plow animals, and milk production. 7· \"run at the sound of the drum and run at the rising of smoke\" An expression describing how the destitute were often forced to beg for alms during ritual assemblies, where food offerings might be distributed. The sound of drums and incense smoke were signs that such a gathering was taking place. 8. receiving seven ounces of gold The Tibetan term is sang (~rang), a unit of weight used especially for gold and silver until I959· The sang was equivalent to the Chinese liang (or tael) and weighed about I.3 ounces. 9· one-tenth of an ounce In Tibetan, zho, a term used as a division of weights for precious metals. Ten zho equaled one sang (see"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"244 NOTES note 8), so one zho comes to a little more than a tenth of an ounce. 10. dre vessels A square wooden scoop used for measuring dry and wet goods.

It is found as a metaphor in Buddhist literature for the rarity of a buddha and his teaching appearing in the world. 13. hail tax Tibetan communities traditionally employed the services of \"weather-makers,\" ritual specialists (both Buddhist and Bon) who were sought after for their ability to ward off destructive meteorological events. Such individuals were frequently paid through the collection of a local tax as a form of insurance against hail damage to the region's crops. 14· the six parameters and the four modes A system of hermeneu-tics for interpreting the coded language of tantric Buddhist literature. 15. controlling the subtle winds This refers to the practice of fleet-footedness, a feat attained as the result of yogic meditation whereby an individual is able to travel vast distances with excep-tional speed. 16. figurines from my mother's bones This refers to the common Tibetan tradition of making small religious images (frequently representations of the Buddha, a stupa, or other Buddhist divini-ties) from the pulverized bones of the deceased mixed together with clay.

One thousand again form a third-order thousand-fold world system, which thus encompasses one billion individual world systems. 19.
