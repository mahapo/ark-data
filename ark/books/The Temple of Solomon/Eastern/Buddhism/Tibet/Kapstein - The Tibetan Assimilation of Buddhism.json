The Tibetan assimilation ofBuddhism offers compelling subject matter for reflection about this question, a ques-tion that is now especially pertinent to the study of society and culture. At a time whenpublic discourse, in many domains, including popular interest in Tibet, seems to fixupon notions of hard and fast cultural or ethnic identities, it is well to remind ourselvesthat our identities have always been fluid constructions, whose vitality and ongoingcreation demand internal change and responsiveness to external forces.Much excellent work in the contemporary human sciences, throughout a broad spec-trum of research, has been consecrated to explorations of cultural transmission andadaptation. It would be difficult to mention all that has in one way or another influ-enced my thinking in this area, not to speak of all that I probably should have read butstill have not. To clarify the concerns informing the present book to some extent, how-ever, two works come to mind that, though treating different historical problems fromquite different perspectives, equally contribute to our thinking on the general questionI have posed. I refer to Erik Ziircher's The Buddhist Conquest of China and SergeGruzinski' s recent The Conquest of Mexico (originally La colonisation de I 'imaginaire).With the former, I share here an interest in the spread of Buddhism in early medievalAsia, and the crucial role played, not so much by foreign Buddhist missionaries, butby the formation of an indigenous Buddhist cultural elite who came to articulate theiroriginally foreign faith in their own terms. And whereas Gruzinski examines the re-sponse of a colonized people to the culture of the colonizers, an issue that must be whollydistinguished from our present subject matter, the transformations of indigenous Mexi-can memory and imagination that were entailed by the processes he describes presenta striking analogy to the transformation of the Tibetan imaginaire that was catalyzedby the promulgation of Buddhism.Literary production in the thirteen centuries during which Tibetan has been writ-ten has been vast. At the present time, we have access to many thousands of printedvolumes and manuscripts, containing many tens of thousands of individual works ofdifferent types: biographies and histories, medical treatises, books on astrology anddivination, poems and works on poetics, grammars and dictionaries, ritual handbooks,and writings on all aspects of Tibetan religious life and thought are extensively rep-resented, including those writings devoted strictly to Buddhist doctrine and scholas-tic philosophy. The study of this great legacy is only now emerging from its infancy,and though many particular problems remain unresolved, the general contours of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"viii PrefaceTibetan literary and cultural history are in important respects becoming clear to thosefamiliar at least in a general manner with the range of works now available in theTibetan language. One of my aims in the present work is to convey to readers whoare not Tibetanists some impression of the broad domain of Tibetan religious thoughtthat has now begun to come into view.Throughout this book, I therefore discuss aspects of the historical developmentof Buddhism in Tibet, but, unlike the two books I have mentioned, I do not proposeto present here an historical account of my topic overall. My interest lies first in thevaried textures of Tibetan Buddhist thought, and only secondarily in history per se.For this reason I have proceeded by way of a series of case studies, for the most partoriginally conceived as independent essays, that nevertheless reflect one another intheir concerns. In a separate publication I shall explore in some detail the history ofTibetan Buddhist doctrinal thought in a more restricted sense. Here, however, in thefirst chapter I seek to introduce the history of Buddhist thought in Tibet as a questionfor critical reflection, and I suggest some of the ways in which historical change inthe field of Tibetan thought may itself be conceived. In part 1, \"Conversion and Nar-rative,\" I consider traditions concerning the eighth-century Tibetan adoption of Bud-dhism in relation to the late, legendary accounts of the conversion, as well as aspectsof the earliest evidence that contributes to our understanding of eighth-century events.Part 2, \"Sources of Contestation,\" offers studies of topics relating to doctrinal trans-mission, interpretation, and dispute, in order to illustrate aspects of Buddhist thoughtin Tibet as defining, not a body of static dogmatics, but a much contested field. Inpart 3, \"Myth, Memory, Revelation,\" our concern will be with mythic and philosophi-cal aspects of the Nyingmapa, or Ancient, school of Tibetan Buddhism, in whoserevealed scriptures the formerly alien Indian religion is decisively transfigured tobecome a matter of Tibetan cultural, and even personal, memory.The photograph that appears on the cover of this book provides a view of the greatmonastic complex of Samye. As Tibet's first Buddhist monastery, founded duringthe late eighth century, it is a unique symbol of Tibet's adoption of Buddhism. Notlong after its foundation, it became the site of Tibet's first great doctrinal dispute, inwhich the Chan tradition of China confronted Indian Buddhist scholasticism. Finally,as a center of pilgrimage, even today it remains a focal point of Tibetan historicalmemory. In its three-storeyed structure, then, Samye embodies our key themes ofconversion, contestation, and memory.The chapters of this book draw on materials gathered throughout the entire course ofmy involvement in the study of Tibet, beginning almost three decades ago. To recallall that has been generously given to me that should be acknowledged here wouldrequire a thorough reconstruction of the magical net (mayajala) of intellectual en-counters woven throughout this time. In several chapters, for instance, I refer to anold chronicle called the Testament ofBa (Sba-bzhed). Though I only began to con-sider this important early text in depth five or six years ago, I was first introduced toit in 1972, when, as an undergraduate college student, I had the good fortune to at-tend James Bosson's courses on classical Tibetan at the University of California,Berkeley. While at Berkeley, too, I was able to study Buddhist texts with LewisLancaster, who also encouraged my studies in Nepal. I shall refrain, however, fromlengthy autobiographical reflection just now, and, with apologies to teachers and"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Preface ixfriends who remain unnamed herein, mention those whose counsel and encourage-ment most directly contributed to these pages.Over the years I have been privileged to study and discuss Tibetan Buddhist his-tory and thought with some of the leading representatives of traditional Tibetan learn-ing. Though I write within the tradition of European scholarship, my reading of allthings Tibetan is indelibly marked by the abundant instructions and comments ofH. H.

I often imagine, when Ibecome immersed in the works of the figures discussed in these pages—past mas-ters like Sakya Pandita, Karma Pakshi, Dolpopa, or Longchenpa—that one or moreof these men is reading over my shoulder, challenging me to \"turn not to the words,but to meaning.\" I cannot pretend to comprehend the meaning of their tradition asthey would, much less to communicate that understanding here, but at the least I hopeto convey that Tibetan Buddhist writings do mean to challenge us in ways that re-quire our contemporary reflections to unfold in sustained dialogue with tradition.Ongoing conversations over many years with fellow Tibetanists have cruciallyinfluenced the reflections gathered in this book.

If I nevertheless fall into the tar pit of academicprose, I have only myself to blame. Christine Mollier has graciously given me refer-ences to pertinent Chinese materials, suggestions regarding the book's title, and in-spiration to think things anew.The three chapters of part 1, \"Conversion and Narrative,\" were first presented asthe Numata Lectures at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago in January1997. Gratitude is due to the Numata Foundation, to Clark Gilpin, Dean of the Divin-ity School, and to the Divinity School's Numata Committee: Steven Collins, PaulGriffiths, and Frank Reynolds. These scholars, together with Philip Gossett, Dean ofthe Division of the Humanities, and Sheldon Pollock, Chair of the Department of SouthAsian Languages and Civilizations when I returned to the University of Chicago in1996, have made this a particularly propitious setting in which to complete this book.The presence in Chicago and the friendship of Margot Pritzker and Thomas J. Pritzker,whose deep connections with Tibet and neighboring lands are well known among thoseinvolved in Tibetan Studies, have further contributed to these fortunate circumstances.Generous awards from a number of bodies have directly supported the researchupon which this book is based.

During my last conversation with Dr. Aris,in July 1998 at the meeting of the International Association for Tibetan Studies, anorganization that he had founded, we discussed this book in manuscript, which, withcharacteristic generosity, he had recently read.

Correspondingly, one of the greatestchallenges for the Tibetanist is to find a way in which to represent words and namesof the Tibetan language that can be read by nonspecialists without at the same timeearning the scorn of peers, who prefer exact transcriptions. If the present book offersonly the latest example of failed compromise, I may console myself nevertheless thatfailure along these lines enjoys some very good company indeed.Tibetan, like English and French, is written with a roughly phonetic script that isnot employed phonetically. Just as we write thought where thawt should suffice, sothe Lhasan writes thugs-bsam, but pronounces, very roughly, thusam. This in itselfwould present not much difficulty, if there were a consensus among scholars as to asystem of simplified Tibetan phonetic romanization, but regrettably this is not thecase. On the one hand, Tibetan pronunciation varies considerably from one regionto another, so that a phonetic script must be limited with respect to dialect. On theother, because the actual sounds of Tibetan do not correspond too closely with thesounds normally represented by the roman script as used for English, special con-ventions of usage must be stipulated, and Tibetanists have not so far agreed aboutthese.For the purposes of this book, I have based my transcription on an approximationof modern Central Tibetan pronunciation, retaining the exact transcription of the root-consonant (ming-gzhi) wherever this seems feasible. The following conventionsshould be noted:The vowels a, i, e, o, u are pure vowels, never diphthongs, and their pronuncia-tion is similar to that in Italian. The final e must always be pronounced, never silent.Thus dorje should be pronounced dorje, never dorj. The vowels o and u are pro-nounced as in German.The consonants kh andph are similar to English k and p.

In the same way, tr anddr resemble the sound in drill, while trh is more like that in trill. Ng is as in Englishsing, though English speakers often find it difficult to pronounce in initial position,as in the common Tibetan name Ngawang.K and g are closely similar to the English hard g in gulf, and those not actuallyseeking to master the Tibetan language may pronounce these two letters in just thesame manner. (In Lhasa dialect they differ as to the tone of the syllable they begin,a distinction not made in English.) Similarly: c and j resemble English j, p and b re-semble English b, s and z resemble English s, and sh and zh resemble English sh.

The timeline from 650 to 1400 provides a sketchof Tibetan Buddhist history during this period, and the closing paragraphs summa-rize developments after 1400 to which I also refer herein. Familiarity with this chro-nology will enable the reader to situate the particular topics discussed in the mainbody of the book within the Tibetan historical framework overall.Tibetan traditions and legends trace, for more than thirty generations, theancient origins of the dynasty that succeeded in unifying Tibet as an im-650 perial power during the reign of Songtsen Gampo (c. 617-649/650). TheTibetan writing system is invented at this time, and, according to later leg-endary tradition, Buddhism is first introduced by the emperor's Chinesebride, the princess of Wencheng (d. 684).700 During the time of the emperor Diisong (d. 704), some temples are prob-ably established. Under his son Trhi Detsuktsen (reigned 705-755/756)the princess of Jincheng (d. 739) promotes both Chinese culture andBuddhism.750 The emperor Trhi Songdetsen (reigned 755/756-797) adopts Buddhism,probably in 762. In 763 his armies overrun the Chinese capital, Chang'an.He establishes Tibet's first Buddhist monastery, Samye (c. 779), and dur-ing the 780s conquers Dunhuang, a major center of Chinese Buddhism.The Chinese Chan master Moheyan is invited to central Tibet and be-comes involved in a debate or discussion at Samye with the Indian Bud-dhist philosopher Kamalasila. The Tibetan occupation of Dunhuang leadsto the preservation there of numerous Tibetan manuscripts, whose dis-covery in 1907 provides our richest source of Tibetan documentation forthis period.800 Under Trhi Songdetsen's greatest successors, Trhi Desongtsen (reigned804-815) and Relpacen (reigned 815-838), Buddhism continues to flour-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xviii A Brief Chronology of Tibetan Buddhismish with royal patronage. In the reign of Lang Darma (838-842), patron-age of the monasteries is reduced or withdrawn, and later tradition recountsthat there was a persecution of Buddhism culminating in Lang Darma'sassassination in 842 by a Buddhist monk.850 The collapse of the Central Tibetan royal dynasty follows, with the ensuing900 power vacuum persisting for a full four hundred years, until the Sakyapas,backed by China's Mongol rulers, emerge as Tibet's supreme rulers dur-ing the late thirteenth century.950 The revival of monastic Buddhism in Central Tibet begins towards themiddle of the tenth century. During the late tenth and early eleventh cen-turies, Tibetan Buddhism enters a new period of rapid development andchange. Local lords vie for ascendency, and religious authority is no lesscontested than temporal power. From the late tenth century onwards wefind Tibetan translators and pilgrims journeying to India and Nepal insearch of gurus, scriptures, and esoteric lore.1000 These developments are particularly prominent in Western Tibet, wherethe great translator Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055) is patronized by the mon-archs of the Guge kingdom. The Indian scholar and adept Atisa (982-1054)is invited to teach there beginning in 1042. The careers of these two no-table Buddhist monks mark the beginning of what Tibetan historians callthe \"later spread of the teaching,\" or the age of the \"new translations.\" Inreaction to these new developments the older Tibetan religious traditions—the Bon religion and the Nyingmapa, or \"ancient,\" school of Buddhism—reassert themselves.1050 The new infusion of Indian Buddhist teaching gives rise to a number ofnew Tibetan Buddhist sects and schools. Among the most prominent arethe Kadampa, stemming from Atisa's successors, the Sakyapa, represent-ing the tradition of the Khon family's monastery at Sakya (founded in1073), and the Kagyupa, maintaining the tantric teachings of the transla-tor Marpa (1012-1097).1100 The Kadampa monastery at Sangphu is founded in 1071 or 1073 andswiftly emerges as the leading center for the study of logic and otherphilosophical topics. Marpa's successors proliferate into a large num-ber of Kagyupa sublineages following Gampopa (1079-1153), the fore-most disciple of the poet Milarepa (1040-1123). During the same pe-riod Khyungpo Neljor (d. c. 1135) independently establishes the ShangpaKagyupa tantric tradition.1150 The reassertion of the Bon and Nyingmapa traditions is advanced bymeans of rediscovered \"treasures\" (gter-md), texts and religious objectssaid to have been cached in earlier times and now recovered. NyangrelNyima Ozer (1124-1196) in this way produces a tremendous body ofhistorical and legendary literature that exerts a very considerable influ-ence on the later development of both historiography and religiousthought."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"A Brief Chronology of Tibetan Buddhism xix1200 In 1204, the Kashmiri scholar SakyasrT arrives in Tibet with a retinue oflearned Indian followers, and their visit helps to catalyze a new enthusi-asm for Indian scholarship. An heir to the Khon family of Sakya, whobecomes famed as Sakya Pandita (1182-1251), devotes himself to theadvancement in Tibet of Indian intellectual traditions.1250 In 1246, Sakya Pandita is invited to visit the Mongol ruler, thus initiatingthe relationship between Sakya and Mongol power that dominates Tibetanpolitics for the next century. His nephew, Chogyel Phakpa (1235-1280),becomes state preceptor under Khubilai Khan. Members of non-Sakyapasects also maintain relations with the Mongol lords; examples are the sec-ond Karmapa hierarch, Karma Pakshi (1204-1283), and his successor,Karmapa III Rangjung Dorje (1284-1339).1300 During the period of the Mongol-Sakyapa hegemony, Tibetan Buddhistscholastic philosophy comes into flower. The many famous figures activeduring this period include the Kadampa scholiast Rikpe Reldri (early four-teenth century), the redactor of the Tibetan Buddhist canon, Buton (1290-1364), the founder of the controversial \"extrinsic emptiness\" teaching,Dolpopa (1292-1361), and the master of the Great Perfection system,Longchenpa (1308-1363).1350 Under the leadership of Tai Situ Changchub Gyeltshen of the Phakmodrupaorder, Tibet is freed from the Sakyapa-Mongol regime. The historicalwritings \"rediscovered\" by Orgyen Lingpa (b. 1323) contribute to themythologizing of the 8th-century Tibetan empire. Scholastic philosophycontinues to thrive, particularly in the monastic centers allied with thescholarly traditions of Sakya.1400 Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) founds the Ganden monastery to the east ofLhasa (1409), which soon gives rise to a new Buddhist order, the Gelukpa,and emphasizes its continuities with the older Kadampa school. Thoughgreatly revered for his vast learning and rigorous standard of practice,relations between his disciples and some representatives of the other ordersgrow increasingly contentious. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries wit-ness intensive doctrinal debate between the Gelukpas and their Sakyapaand Kagyupa rivals.The rise of the Gelukpa order coincides with a period of sustained civil war in Tibet.By the sixteenth century, important powers in the central Tibetan province of U areallied with the Gelukpas, while the kings of Tsang in the west support hierarchs ofthe Kagyupa and other schools. One of the leading Gelukpa hierarchs, SonamGyamtsho, becomes a missionary to the Mongols and, on winning the allegianceof the chieftain Allan Khan (1578), receives the Mongolian title Dalai Lama (\"oce-anic guru\"). Because the title is bestowed posthumously on his predecessors, he be-comes the third in the line. The connection forged with the Mongols encourages therenewed interest of the Mongolian leadership in Tibetan affairs, and in 1642 GushriKhan of the Khoshot tribe conquers all of Tibet, establishing the Fifth Dalai Lama(1617-1682) as ruler of the reunified realm."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xx A Brief Chronology of Tibetan BuddhismIn 1717, the Mongolian Dzungar tribe invades Tibet, bringing renewed civil warand intersectarian violence.

Besides Tibet's ancient indigenous traditions, that are still percep-tible both in their persistent survivals and in elements of the earliest written records,'early medieval Tibet knew of Chinese historiography and Greek medicine, Nepalesesculpture and Sogdian textiles, Nestorian Christianity and Manichaeism.2 The pene-tration by Buddhism of Tibetan culture, so that the two would become to all intentsand purposes indivisibly associated, was not yet previsioned, and to explain the suc-cess and thoroughness of Buddhism's Tibetan conquest remains a central problemfor the historical study and interpretation of Tibetan civilization. The sketches of threekey issues given here may serve as an introduction, delineating some important as-pects of the rise of Buddhism in Tibet, and providing a point of departure for thestudies that follow in later chapters.Like some who have in recent years considered the relations among systematicand narrative modes of discourse,31 am concerned throughout this book with the studyof a particular cultural sphere that is not our own, in this instance the realm of Ti-betan Buddhism. Investigations such as these tend to underscore the apparent gulfseparating descriptive and documentary scholarship from the domain of theory andinterpretation, while at the same time they call into question any such deep divide. Inthe study of cultural history, this emerges wherever the question of contextualizationimposes itself upon us, as it does whenever complex domains of discourse—worldsof thought in which myth and science, history and metaphysics, logic and poetryintersect, blend, and rebound—become subject matter for our reflections. We knowthat contextual background plays a crucial role in understanding, so we can't elimi-nate it. But we can't seem to come up with a decisive formulation of what that role isto be, so often we'd like to. I very much doubt that we shall ever be able to providea purely methodological account of contextualization that would also serve as anacceptable guide to practice.4 The scholar as contextualizer must in the end be a mythmaker, spinning tales of reason, truth, and history, in virtue of which the actions,1"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"4 The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhismarts, sciences, and, myths of persons elsewhere and elsewhen may become some-how more intelligible for us than they would have been otherwise. In this regard, notall myths are equal: some succeed relatively better than others in the task of makingthe foreign intelligible to us, and thereby opening our own world of discourse to voicespreviously unheard.Before turning to some of my own myths, I must briefly mention certain wide-spread conceptions of the history of Buddhism in Tibet that in our present contextcan be misleading, obscuring for us the real complexities of historical processes andcultural patterns.5 On the one hand, Tibetan Buddhism is often presented as an arch-conservative tradition, preserving unchanged for a full millenium the religious cul-ture of northeastern India's great Buddhist monasteries. It is urged that only theBuddhism of Tibet, at least in its orthodox forms, authentically embodies the totalityof the Indian Buddhist heritage, faithfully maintained throughout the centuries withlittle appreciable innovation or deformation.6 This viewpoint is certainly fostered bythe genuine conservatism of many aspects of ritual and practice, but also by the ide-ology of monastic Buddhism in Tibet, in this respect an ideology that often appearsto systematically devalue innovation and personal inventiveness, considering themsources of deviation and of the transgression of the genius of the past.7 From thisperspective, the brilliance of Tibetan Buddhism has been precisely its unalterableadherence to the form and content of Indian Buddhism, as sanctioned by the Buddhahimself. It is a viewpoint that is radically ahistorical. It is, in short, a form of reli-gious perennialism.Opposed to this, it has also often been held that Buddhism in Tibet was the re-sult of radical transformations in which the character of the Indian Buddhist tradi-tion was all but lost. Tibetan Buddhism, it is said, was indeed the product of IndianBuddhism, but liberally mixed with large doses of Hindu tantrism and indigenousTibetan demonology and superstition.8 By contrast, contemporary popular Bud-dhism in the West has in recent years begun to elaborate a more generous interpre-tation of change within Buddhist traditions, maintaining that the various Buddhismsof the Asian past, of which Tibetan Buddhism is offered as a paradigmatic example,must be seen as creative traditions that for good reason did not merely replicatetheir Indian sources but ingeniously adapted them to local conditions. This, it issometimes argued, provides an historical warrant for the current fabrication of adistinctively Western Buddhism.What I wish to emphasize here is that the Tibetan Buddhist tradition was not,for all its conservatism, a static replication of Indian antiquity, nor, in its dynamicaspects, was it the product of deliberate contrivance on the part of Tibetans moti-vated to construct a uniquely Tibetan form of Buddhism.9 Buddhism in Tibet de-veloped through a sustained and subtle process, whereby the foreign religionachieved a decisive cultural hegemony but was at the same time, as conquerorsalmost always are, transformed by its own success. Aspects of that process, asevidenced within the sphere of Tibetan Buddhist thought, will be our chief con-cern in these pages.We may begin, however, by reflecting upon a single general problem: what sortsof evidence do we find of historical change in Tibetan thought as a result of the ad-vent of Buddhism? Some may argue, of course, that the initial presence of Buddhismin Tibet did not really change much of anything at all.10 My own view is that it did,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction 5and that it did so profoundly. To illustrate this, let us consider briefly three topicsthat may stand as examples: death, literacy, and aspects of the formation of the Ti-betan cultural elite.The Uncertain Fate of the DeadBoth the archaeological record and the earliest written documents demonstrate theimportance to pre-Buddhist Tibet of mortuary rites.11 The Old Tibetan Chronicle,found at Dunhuang and dating perhaps to the late eighth or early ninth century, openswith an account of the death of the first mortal king, whose forebears had passeddirectly to the heavens leaving no earthly remains, and it recounts the origins of royalburial practice: the monarch's hair was to be braided and his face painted with ver-milion; his body was preserved in a mausoleum, with offerings of food and drink.12The documents from Dunhuang also include a description of the program to be fol-lowed at royal funerals, which required the services of an elaborate and specializedpriesthood.13 The royal funerals, as we know from other sources, often followed deathby several years, and the two events, death and the culminating performance of thelast rites, were scrupulously recorded in the imperial annals, reinforcing our impres-sion that these were especially solemn moments for the old Tibetan monarchy.14 LaterTibetan historiography clearly reflects this, for one of the details mentioned in con-nection with most of the early monarchs is the construction and placement of theirmausoleums.15 These ancient tombs, in fact, have remained hallowed places of pil-grimage down to our own times.16The careful attendance of the dead, their provision with adequate nutrition, andalso the traditions concerning the direct bodily ascent of the most ancient kings tothe heavens—these convince us that early on there must have been well-formed Ti-betan beliefs concerning the fate of the dead. Just what those beliefs were, however,remains unclear.17 As will be seen in chapter 3, there is some reason to hold that thepossibility of reincarnation, at least in the event of neonatal death, was maintained,further supporting the impression that there was indeed a conception of the persis-tence of some type of soul. Even in this case, however, it is clear that the stable con-tinuity of the family, and not speculation about the afterlife, was the central concern.18Indeed, as the later Tibetan institution of an incarnate religious hierarchy demon-strates, the Buddhist teaching of transmigration would itself eventually be made toserve an ancient and autochthonous Tibetan interest in stable succession.19 What-ever the uncertainties of these matters when seen from our present perspective, how-ever, several of the earliest Tibetan Buddhist documents clearly treat the Buddhistconception of a repeating cycle of birth, death, and rebirth as alien to earlier Tibetanbelief. A particularly striking example, now well known to Tibetanists through thework of Yoshiro Imaeda, is The Cycle of Birth and Death, whose opening canto re-counts this tale:Throughout numberless aeons in the past,All corporeal beings and all of the gods,Because they live for many years,Have not beheld the phenomena of birth and death."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"6 The Tibetan Assimilation of BuddhismThus they hope to remain alive forever.The lord of their realm, Light Blazing King,20Dwelt in the heavenly mansion of Exalted Light,Radiating with fine light, unbearable to behold.All those dwelling, above and below,Appeared there as if in a mirror.The windows are adorned with sun and moon;It is a fine place, a happy dwelling—-no end to what can be said!All wealth appears just as you think it—All of it is magical stuff!His body is as if blazing with golden light,And his thousand sons and retinue of ten thousand relations,Thus appearing with magical power,All hope to remain this way forever!At some time the Light Blazing King of that realmFell upon the time when his life had run out:Unable to demonstrate his qualities of magical power,The excellent bodily light that had blazed now dimmed.Forgetting to speak and even the movement of breath,He thought all of this was startling.Though he asked each and every one,\"What was my fault?

Precious Jewel ultimately finds the goal of his quest in India, meeting therewith the Buddha of the present age, Sakyamuni. The Buddha, in conclusion, assuagesthe fears of the Tibetan gods by teaching to them a tantric funeral ritual that will in-sure the future well-being of the deceased.24Another Dunhuang manuscript contains a short collection of Buddhist texts con-nected with funerary rituals.25 It is of considerable interest, for while presaging insome respects the developed Tibetan literature on the bar-do, the \"intermediary state\"intervening between death and rebirth, it also contains, in its later passages not quotedhere, a critique of more ancient Tibetan beliefs.26 At the same time, however, asImaeda once more has pointed out, it seems to incorporate elements that cannot betraced in properly Buddhist mortuary rituals but that may be of archaic Tibetan ori-gin, namely, its direct calls addressed to the deceased.27 This would later emerge asa hallmark of the rites of the bar-do:Now listen, you who are deceased! Fickle impermanence, the real nature of the wholeworld, has at this time befallen you, the deceased. The illusion of the five conditionedbundles has been undone. It's time to provide you with the great refuge for one whojourneys from this world to the next. Your lords and refuges, in journeying as onewithout a second to uncertain domains, are the Buddhas, who are transcendent lords,the bodhisattvas, who are great heroes, and the exalted arhats. None are greater thanthese. Therefore, you who are deceased, do not let your mind stray, do not allow yourthoughts to rebel, but at all times think on the Three Precious Jewels, and, turning tothose Precious Jewels, let the mind's path tend to nothing else whatsoever! Do notunbalance the scales of thought!Hear more, you who are deceased! Obtaining illusory bodies in this prison of thethree realms, all who are born die in the end. No one is free from that! Journeyingthus from one birth to the next, the path of birth and death is oppressive.

Because thereexists such a hellish place, O you who are deceased, take care not to miss your pathand to stumble!But if, perchance, you fear you might fall, there is a bodhisattva called the exaltedAvalokitesvara, who will protect you straight away from that great hell. Rememberhis name, pray to him ..., recite his mantra, beseech him for refuge, and you will befreed from that awful place.28Following this, the soul is guided to avoid falling into birth among the tormented spirits(yi-dwags, Skt. preta) and animals. Escaping thus the infernal realms, the final goal towhich the deceased is now conducted is indeed the goal of the Buddhist path, nirvana,but interestingly it is very closely associated in this case with paradise,29 as is reflectedin one of the titles by which this rite is designated, the \"teaching of the path to the gods'realm\" (lha-yul-du lam bstan-pa). The text here continues:From this Rose-Apple Continent, there is in the north Mount Meru. It is the king ofmountains, made of four sorts of precious gems. On its summit is the gathering placeof the gods of the excellent religion, where the lord of the gods, Indra, and his thirty-two ministers open the way and show the paths of gods and men and of the world.There that king of the gods will teach the instructions of the doctrine to you, O wor-thy son, and the power of [your] merits will be emptied. O worthy son! then on thenorthern summit of Mount Meru, there is the palace called Alakavati, where the tran-scendent lord, glorious Vajrapani, dwells with a retinue of many wrathful ones.30Worthy son, he will confer empowerment upon you, granting all desires to yourheart's content. Then, worthy son, owing to the blessing of Vajrapani, continue yourjourney, and in the divine abode of Tusita there is the religious regent of BuddhaSakyamuni, who is called sublime Maitreya. His retinue includes the bodhisattvasVasumitra and Simhantara, the 996 bodhisattvas of the Auspicious Aeon, and others,as well as numberless godlings. In a jeweled palace, with flowing godly robes, theenjoyment of varied musical instruments, and other such things unimaginable, theperfect provisions of happiness, in that holy, divine land may you be cautious aboutthose many joys!Worthy son, do not be complacent with divine enjoyment and its delights alone,but convey yourself and all sentient beings to perfect nirvana! Establish an attitudethat never tires of seeking the accumulations of merit and gnosis! May you obtain,too, freedom from the passions.31Unlike the later Tibet traditions of the bar-do, which direct the deceased to avoid allrealms of rebirth, and to attain the highest enlightenment without falling into eitherinfernal or divine abodes, the \"teaching of the path to the gods' realm\" regardsdivine rebirth as a passage through which one must journey in order to arrive atBuddhism's supreme end.From the late tenth century onwards, Tibet became the stage for the renewedtransmission of Buddhist teachings and esoteric lore from India. Rituals, medi-tations, and yogic practices, including many that were intended to forestall deathor to ensure that the deceased would realize an auspicious path, were now intro-duced in great numbers, and accordingly the funerary rites of Tibetan authorshiprespond to or absorb these new sources. The so-called Tibetan Book of the Dead,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction 9redacted during the fourteenth century, is only the most famous product of thisprocess.32One of the many colorful figures involved in the revived transmission of tantricesotericism during this period was Khyungpo Neljor, \"the yogin of the Eagle clan.\"33Though there is considerable uncertainty about his precise dates, the main period ofhis activity seems to have been the late eleventh through early twelfth centuries.Originally an adherent of the Bon religion, he converted to Buddhism and became atfirst a follower of the ancient Nyingmapa school. Like many others of his genera-tion, however, he regarded India as the source of uniquely authoritative Buddhistteachings, and so he left Tibet to pursue his path in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal,and in India proper.Among Khyungpo Neljor's surviving writings is a brief collection of instructionsconcerning the bar-do teachings as derived from the systems of tantric yoga he hadstudied.34 Though he does clearly refer there to Indian works that had been intro-duced to Tibet before the end of the eleventh century, the text is striking for its con-tinued development of the apparently indigenous Tibetan tradition of calling the dead.It incorporates, too, the Chinese Buddhist custom of practicing the death rites forseven weeks, by mentioning the possibility that the bar-do will itself last for sevenweeks, a temporal specification that is well known in connection with the later Bookof the Dead.35 It further presages the Book of the Dead by its constant reference tothe sophisticated metaphysical doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism, inasmuch as thesehad been incorporated into later Indian Buddhist tantrism.36 For instance, in onepassage Khyungpo Neljor writes:Now, if the intermediate state is brief it lasts one week, and if long, then after experi-encing the varied pains and manifestations of the intermediate state for seven weeksyou will take birth again. What's more, if at that time you should think \"I'm dead!\"then those of you who possess the instructions will be reached at that time by the voiceof the guru, saying, \"Know the intermediate state to be the intermediate state! Medi-tatively cultivate the conqueror's body of rapture!\" and so you will know not to befrightened, because here is a time for awakening as a buddha. Hence, you will peti-tion the guru and cultivate the contemplation that all the appearances of the interme-diate state are your own projections, and that all your own projections are nonveridicalapparition and dream. You will place your devotion in the emanations and transfor-mations of the meditational deity, and especially think to meditate upon the outerenvironment as the celestial palace, the inner inhabitants as gods and goddesses, andyour own body as the threefold deity. Just then, owing to the powers realized in thecultivation of [the yoga of] the dream during your previous life, you may naturallyarise in the conqueror's body of perfect rapture, adorned with major and minor marks,apparent but insubstantial, without hankering for veridical existence—this is a divinebody, the great seal (mahamudra), whose essence is the body of reality (dharmakaya),whose phenomenal features are the body of rapture (sambhogakaya), whose activi-ties are the emanational body (nirmanakaya), and which, in their indivisibility, is thebody of great bliss (mahasukhakaya). Thereby, until the sea of samsara is emptied,training each in accord with his or her needs, you will bring sentient beings to matu-ration and liberation.37With the wide distribution of the Book of the Dead and similar works, such con-ceptions came to pervade both Tibetan beliefs regarding the possible fate of the dead,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"10 The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhismand the formulation of ritual means whereby the lasting peace of the dead might bestbe secured.38 But the changes we have surveyed here were not the result of the im-portation of Buddhist beliefs and practices plain and simple; they were the product,rather, of an ongoing process of accommodation, in which the alien and the indige-nous came by stages to suffuse one another.Literacy and Learning in a Dark AgeAs the foregoing sketch of the history of death in Tibet makes clear, there were twoperiods of great and profound historical change that formed the background for theparticular transformations we have examined. The first of these occurred with therise and expansion of the old Tibetan empire in the seventh to ninth centuries andthe second a century or so after its fall, with the revival of the transmission of IndianBuddhism to Tibet towards the end of the tenth century. The remaining chapters ofthis book take up various aspects of Buddhism under the empire and during the pe-riod of post-tenth-century revival. One of the great puzzles in the study of Tibetanhistory, however, remains the \"dark age\" of a century or so intervening between thetwo. Because only a small number of documents can be assigned with reasonablecertainty to this period, for the most part our conclusions about it must of necessitybe derived indirectly. Reflection on the maintenance of literacy, and on the uses ofliteracy for the representation and organization of knowledge, are particularly sug-gestive in this regard.According to tradition, the Tibetan language was first written during the earlyseventh century, when the monarch Songtsen Gampo (c. 617-649/650) commandedthat a standard script be devised. His minister Thonmi Sambhota is said to have beendispatched to Kashmir, where he studied Indian systems of writing and the Sanskritlanguage. On the basis of his studies under brahman masters, he invented a Tibetanalphabet and also composed a series of grammars for the new literary language.Though the veracity of this account has been regarded with skepticism in recent schol-arship, there can be no doubt that the seventh and eighth centuries saw the develop-ment of written Tibetan as a vehicle for both administration and the transmission ofculture, and that the growth of Tibetan literacy contributed to great and enduringchanges in the Tibetan world. Literacy facilitated the redaction and regularization ofindigenous Tibetan laws and traditions; the governance of the tremendous territoryruled by the old Tibetan empire, with its diverse peoples and customs, until its col-lapse in the ninth century; and, crucially, the absorption by the Tibetans of vast quan-tities of alien learning. We shall return to these and other questions posed by thedevelopment of Tibetan literacy during this period in chapter 4.Traditional accounts of early postimperial Tibetan history, repeated throughoutlater Tibetan historical writing, maintain that, following a persecution of Buddhismthat was supposed to have occurred at the order of the emperor Lang Darma, and inthe wake of his assassination, probably in 842, Buddhist activity in Tibet virtuallyground to a halt, not to be revived for perhaps a hundred years.39 The few monkswho both survived and continued to uphold their vows are said to have fled CentralTibet to find refuge in the far northeast, in what is today Qinghai. Their presencethere formed the seed for a Tibetan monastic revival, which brought about a reestab-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction 11lishment of Buddhism in Central Tibet during the mid-tenth century.40 Besides thetransmission of the monastic vows, traditional sources concur that some TibetanBuddhist educational activity also continued throughout the \"dark age\" in far east-ern Tibet, though there is disagreement about the extent and precise nature of suchactivity. In particular, there is reason to hold that some elements of Buddhist scho-lastic learning—for instance, the formal study of the regulations of the Vinaya andof the \"meta-doctrine,\" or Abhidharma, as well as of the important Perfection ofWisdom treatise, \\he,Abhisamayalamkara (The Ornament of Emergent Realization)—did indeed remain alive in the east.41It is clear, though, that matters must have been far more complex than this ac-count alone suggests: how, for example, was the knowledge of the imposing Bud-dhist translation literature that had been created under the empire preserved over aspan of three or four generations in the absence of all but a smattering of ongoingBuddhist education in the Tibetan far east? Though some religious communities inthe east no doubt preserved important traditions of Tibetan Buddhist learning estab-lished earlier while the empire still held sway, it seems unlikely that book learningwas exclusively sustained in this way. Deeper reflection on the available evidencesuggests that Tibetan Buddhism, once established under the empire, never reallyvanished. Though the period in question was a sort of Tibetan \"dark age,\" it is clearthat, as was the case for its counterpart in Europe, even in the darkness the light wasnever entirely extinguished.One sign that Tibetan remained alive as a literary language during this time, pri-marily in surviving (and perhaps even growing) Buddhist circles, is that the literaryTibetan that develops after the tenth century is to a great degree derived from whathad earlier been a language of scriptural translation. At the same time, the archaicliterary Tibetan known from Dunhuang, the old royal inscriptions, and other earlysources, gradually falls out of use, becoming increasingly obscure to later genera-tions of Tibetans. Thus, it seems plausible that following the collapse of the dynasty,as the archaic language used by the civil and military adminstration became obsoleteand a literate culture was preserved largely among Tibet's Buddhists, Buddhist us-age gradually emerged as the standard, even in writing about subjects such as historythat had previously been written in the language employed by the state bureaucracy.42Some such development would have contributed to the iconizing of Buddhism andits originally Indian context as the paradigms of learned (that is, literate) and presti-gious culture. The persistence of Tibetan literacy to a degree that permitted knowl-edge of sophisticated Buddhist texts to be preserved, including some knowledge ofTibetan-Sanskrit lexicography,43 must certainly count as prima facie evidence thatTibet's dark age was not nearly so bleak as the traditional historiography would haveus suppose. Several other considerations support this same conclusion.To begin, the earliest available sources by no means establish the persecution ofBuddhism by Lang Darma, a crucial event for later Tibetan historical consciousness,to have in fact occurred. Several scholars have now argued that little more than areduction of patronage may have been at stake, and that there is good evidence show-ing Lang Darma himself to have been initially a Buddhist king who enjoyed the goodwishes of the clergy.44 This, however, may go too far in the way of rehabilitating theapostate king: we must note that there is one manuscript from Dunhuang, datingprobably to the end of the tenth century, that strikingly does not mention Lang Darma"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"12 The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhismin an enumeration of Tibet's royal patrons of Buddhism, though at the same time itcontains no suggestion of a persecution.45 It seems possible that the persecution,despite its great importance in later thought, was in essence a withdrawal of patron-age, no doubt due to a poor current accounts balance rather than to anti-Buddhistsentiment,46 which came to be very much exaggerated in its retellings.In addition, as the historiography of the Nyingmapa tradition underscores, thepersecution is not supposed to have much affected lay adherents of tantric Buddhism,and other sources, too, emphasize familial lineages of tantric practioners active dur-ing this time.47 Many of the Dunhuang Tibetan tantric manuscripts probably are alsoto be attributed to the period between the fall of the dynasty and the cultural renais-sance in western Tibet towards the end of the first millenium.48 However we inter-pret reports, beginning as early as the late tenth century, that the Tibetan tantrism ofthis period had grown degenerate,49 we may nevertheless attribute to tantric circlessome role in maintaining basic skills of alphabetization. Just as the Japanese kanasyllabary is supposed to have been derived from principles used in the phonetic rep-resentation of Buddhist mantras, so in the Tibetan case the ritual requirements ofesoteric Buddhism, though not involved in the initial formation of the script, maywell have contributed to its maintenance and promotion.50Further, let us note that Lang Darma's successors, who ruled variously truncatedportions of the old empire, mostly seem to have maintained clearly Buddhist identi-ties, and to have sponsored projects including temple building and calendrical recti-fication that surely would have required the services of persons with some formallearning. Though later historical traditions tended to forget or to ignore the evidencein this area, the earliest available records provide indications of such activities con-tinuing even in the midst of the dark age in Central Tibet.51Finally, we must add that there are indications, derived from Chinese sources re-porting on Tibetan populations in far northeastern Tibet during the tenth century,that Buddhist activity in those parts was in fact far more extensive than the later Ti-betan histories would have us believe.52 In short, there were likely several differentcultural formations in early postimperial Tibet that were able to maintain to varyingdegrees basic skills in the use of the written language, and these were mostly, so faras we can now determine, tied to Buddhism in one way or another.I have already suggested that the written language itself was transformed as a resultof the dominance of what had at first been an artificial language of translation. Arethere other important changes that seem due to the tie now forged between Buddhismand Tibetan literacy? There are, certainly, many examples that may be adduced inresponse to this question, and the later chapters of this book show some of the extentto which narratives and ideas derived from Buddhist writings became the natural-ized media for Tibetan self-expression. Suffice it to add in brief here one illustrationthat indicates something of the depth of the impact made by the Buddhist domina-tion of literacy upon the formation of Tibetan thought.As is well known, there is in Tibet an organized religion besides Buddhism that isregarded by Tibetans as the religion of pre-Buddhist Tibet, namely, Bon. In contem-porary scholarship, doubts have been expressed about whether there was in fact anorganized Tibetan religion prior to the introduction of Buddhism, and whether theterm bon, as used in archaic documents, names such a religion.53 These questionsneed not detain us here, for it seems relatively clear that, once Buddhism had estab-"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Introduction 13lished itself in Tibet, the indigenous religious traditions, whether organized or not,underwent enormous transformations that were in large measure catalyzed byBuddhism's presence. The Bon religion as we now know it, with its monastic in-stitutions, tantric rituals, and scriptural canons, is surely the most remarkable out-come of such transformations. At the same time, this must not be taken to suggestthat the Bon religion came into existence merely as a nativist reaction to Buddhism.The formation of Bon involved an intricate synthesis of archaic Tibetan traditionnot only with Buddhism, but with other cultural influences flowing into Tibet aswell.54The massive collections of Bonpo scriptures that have become recently availablehave not yet been adequately studied.55 General remarks about them are of necessityunsure, and the investigation of the Bonpo textual traditions promises to provide fertilesubject matter for Tibetan Studies for many years to come. Nevertheless, on the basisof what is already known, it is evident that the formation of the Bonpo corpus, whilepreserving and recording vast quantities of indigenous Tibetan tradition, among manyother matters, was also responsive to Buddhist textual models throughout. This be-comes especially clear with the revelation, from the late tenth century onwards ofthe Bonpo versions of the Prajnaparamita and other important canonical sutras.56Though there are indications that there was indeed a literate Bon (or \"proto-B6n\")priesthood active during the early postimperial period, and perhaps even before,57it seems sure that their literary production came increasingly to fall under a Bud-dhist star. This may be seen, for instance, in examining the analysis in early Bonand Buddhist sources of approaches to spiritual practice in terms of various schemesinvolving nine sequential \"vehicles\" (theg-pa rim-pa dgu).5& Though the metaphorof the vehicle as a spiritual path is certainly derived from Indian Buddhism,59 it islikely that the ninefold enumeration was a Tibetan innovation. In sources plausi-bly composed in the tenth century, or soon thereafter, there is considerable dis-agreement about how the nine are to be enumerated, though the various systemsoverlap considerably. An early Buddhist version from Dunhuang, for instance,declares:One might ask, to what does \"nine sequential vehicles\" refer? The nine vehicles arethe vehicle of men, the vehicle of gods, the vehicle of pious attendants (sravaka), thevehicle of the self-realized ones (pratyekabuddha), the vehicle of the sutras, the ve-hicle of the bodhisattvas, and then the Yoga, Kriya and Upaya.60Another Buddhist text, the Man-ngag Ita-ba 'i phreng-ba (The Garland of Views: AnEsoteric Precept), attributed to Padmasambhava and certainly in circulation prior tothe eleventh century,61 adopts a different scheme of enumeration:The numberless erroneous views of sentient beings in the realms of the world maybe gathered into four categories: indifferent, materialistic, nihilistic, and extremist.. .. [But] in the path transcending the world, there are two: the dialectical vehicleand the vehicle of indestructible reality (vajrayana). And in the dialectical vehiclethere are three: (1) the vehicle of the pious attendants, (2) the vehicle of the self-realized ones, and (3) the vehicle of the bodhisattvas. ...

The reader may not notice, however, that Shega'sexpression of hedonism is borrowed almost verbatim from Sanskrit sources, and thatthis sage among Bonpo divinities is in fact a redescription of the rsi Brhaspati, leg-endary founder of India's materialist philosophies.67A comparison of these three schemes of nine vehicles, which originate during roughlythe same age, but in different traditions, demonstrates at once their affinities (tab. 1).What, in our present context, is the significance of the similarities and differenceswe find here? I have argued that, during the period following the collapse of theempire, there was, contrary to impressions derived from the later historiography, anongoing maintenance of elements of literacy and formal learning, primarily in Bud-dhist circles. In the formation of the various nine-vehicle schemes, it is evident thatsuch communities were not, however, simply repeating what was to be derived fromearlier Buddhist sources, but also were engaged in actively exploring, to varyingdegrees on the basis of those sources, ways of reformulating and expressing religioustraditions that were felt to be congenial to Tibetan ways of thinking. This processrendered it possible for the evolving field of literate agency increasingly to involvethe participation of some who asserted the supremacy of the non-Buddhist traditionswith which they were identified and which were the established basis for their statusand authority, over and against the alien presence of Buddhism. Of course, what wasimportant was not the fact of the foreign or native origin of religious ideas and prac-tices—here, as in so much of our experience, it was the feel of the thing that mat-tered, and not the historical actualities.This is not to say, of course, that the emerging Bonpo corpus was mere imitationor that the Bonpo authors lacked originality: recent investigations of relatively earlyBb'npo dialectical texts, for instance, have demonstrated some excellent examples ofgenuinely novel developments, even if these were inspired ultimately by still earlierBuddhist sources.68 In some cases, too, we know that Tibetan Buddhist literature lib-erally borrowed from Bb'npo texts.69 What seems most impressive, given our emerg-ing knowledge of the formation of the Bonpo tradition, is the range of topics aboutwhich Bonpo thinkers ventured to formulate original statements, even if these for-mulations, consisted, as certainly they sometimes did, in giving literary expressionto Buddhist conceptions in distinctively Tibetan terms. In this passage, for instance,we have a delightful summary of exegetical methods applied to the teaching of thespiritual paths and meditational practices of the Great Perfection (rdzogs-chen) tra-ditions of Bon, for which the intuitive reali/ation of the \"mind of enlightenment\" isthe focal concern of both study and contemplative practice:"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Table 1.

First is the explanation that resembles garuda's flight: the explanation isoffered by traversing in a bound the general extent of the ground [and realizing] theabiding nature of the view [which comprehends that ground]. In the explanation thatfollows the lion's leap, you collect together the examples and topics that are scatteredout of order, and explain the text, restoring order to it. Explanations that proceed withthe duck's waddle delimit the topics, lead straight down the path, remove sources oferror with scriptural citations, provide a guideline of personal instruction, and so ex-plain the text in full detail. Explanations according to the cuckoo's warble disclosetruth with respect to the unerring significance of the mind of enlightenment,70 so thatthese explanations excel beyond [those of] the eight [lower] vehicles. Finally, expla-nations in the manner of the turtle's withdrawal [into its shell] provide the fortunateindividual with just the abbreviated pith of the text.71Indian works on Buddhist scriptural exegesis had first been translated into Tibetanduring the late eighth and early ninth centuries and clearly provided the initial impe-tus for Tibetan reflection on such matters.72 Nevertheless, what we see here is evi-dence of a process of creative appropriation. However the precise debts of one tradi-tion to the other be apportioned, this should not obscure for us the fact that Buddhistwritten representations of religious ideas decisively established the framework forlater literary developments, but within that framework had also to make room forcompeting voices.Elite Buddhism and the Expression of AuthorityWe know from the old Tibetan documents found at Dunhuang, and from later epictraditions as well, that Tibet had early on elaborated a conception of sacral kingship,profoundly tied to the ideals of an heroic and aristocratic society. The earliest knownversion of the myth of the first Tibetan king shows not only men, but the entire natu-ral world, leaning in homage towards the king, in honor of his inherent charisma.73In both the Old Tibetan Chronicle from Dunhuang and the later Epic of Gesar, thevalues of cunning, magical effulgence, and power, and the dangers of the hubris thatarises from these, are frequently encountered themes.74 And once we move fromlegendary to historical time in the seventh to the ninth centuries, we find that theemperors styled themselves \"divine rulers of magical sagacity.\"75Following the breakup of the old Tibetan empire, those vying for authority soughtto recapture elements of this confluence of divinity, wisdom, and power, and con-nections with Buddhist learning and with those who had reputations for spiritual at-tainment emerged as important signifiers of merit. This had indeed been presaged inthe later empire's adoption of the Buddhist religion. The association of Buddhismwith the old monarchy and its successors, its mastery of literacy and learning in thisworld and of one's destiny hereafter—these are among the factors that help to ex-plain the cultural ascendancy that Buddhism had achieved in Tibet by the eleventhcentury, when the historical record returns to the light. Personal mastery of Buddhistlearning and ritual, above all in forms that were believed to represent authoritativeIndian Buddhist sources, now became the preeminent marker of personal excellence,and hence the defining feature of an emerging cultural elite. This is reflected in a"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"18 The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhismpassage from the life of Khyungpo Neljor, whose work on the intermediate statefollowing death we have referred to above:From the start, since my paternal ancestors were all Bonpo masters, I had a hankeringor disposition [for Bonpo teachings]. At age thirteen I studied all the outer and innerBon teachings with the master Yungdrung-gyel and became learned in them. An as-sembly of about seven hundred who possessed ritual skull-cups gathered around me,and I composed many rites, treatises, and commentaries, and so caused the Bon teach-ings to be spread throughout the three provinces of Tibet. I became a Bon scholar andadept, and produced many learned pupils. ...Though I actually saw many assemblies of deities and my occult powers becameunlimited, so that I became an indisputable [master of Bon], nevertheless some doubtsarose in rny own mind. I thought, \"Bon has not been translated by the panditas [ofIndia] or by the undisputed translators [of Tibet.] People say that I am not a man ofthe Dharma, but that I am a Bonpo. So now, as prophesied by the adept Amogha, Imust go to India.\"76Ritual mastery and learning by themselves, it appears, are now insufficient. It is theundisputed possession of Buddhist teachings stemming directly from India that veri-fies one's worth.The dichotomy between autochthony and Indian origin, however, was neitherequivalent to nor effaced the tension between magical or ritual sources of authorityand clerical prestige. That this was a source of continuing rivalry is clearly indicatedby the biographies of the eleventh-century masters of the Zur lineage of the Nying-mapa, where we find opposing factions formed even among the disciples of a singlemaster:At first, the teacher and his students ... mainly devoted themselves to study; so therewere few who were adept at the rites of enlightened activity. When discussions wereheld in the teaching court, those who did know the rites were seated among the igno-rant, who did not participate in the discussions. [In retaliation] the ritualists wouldnot allow the others to chant when they assembled for the daily torma offerings. Atthis Lama Zurpoche said, \"One may be liberated by arriving at the culmination of anysubject. It is not right to scorn one another. .. ,\"77But scorn one another they certainly did. The opposition that we encounter here runsthroughout the later history of Tibetan Buddhism and has been interpreted variouslyby students of Tibetan religion.Geoffrey Samuel, in his wide-ranging book Civilized Shamans, has emphasizedthe distinction between what he characterizes as \"shamanic\" and \"clerical\" Bud-dhism.78 Though I now think the former is an unfortunately confusing term that per-haps should be abandoned in this context,791 believe that Samuel nevertheless rightlydescribes an important dichotomy within Tibetan Buddhism, as suggested by theanecdotes just given and also by our earlier examinations of death and of literacy.We may say that, on the one hand, Tibetan Buddhism came to define itself soterio-logically, as concerned with the practical attainment of freedom, whether from theills of this life, or from evil rebirth, or from samsara altogether, and that this was forthe most part expressed in terms of ritual mastery. On the other hand, it defined itselfin terms of the control of knowledge. In Tibetan terms, this distinction accords broadlywith that between the accomplished adept's attainment (grub-pa) and skillful mas-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Introduction 19tery of the branches of learning (mkhas-pa): both are terms Khyungpo Neljor uses inthe passage quoted above. To the extent that these may be represented as two dispar-ate ideals that demand different types of virtuosity, we do find much evidence ofcompetition between adepts and clerics. Nevertheless, Tibetan Buddhism came intime to promote a synthesis; the greatest masters were to be \"gurus endowed withboth learning and attainment\" (mkhas-grub gnyis-ldan-gyi bla-ma). It was this syn-thesis that eventually came to define Tibet's Buddhist elite.The study of Tibetan Buddhism in the United States has often emphasized the formsof knowledge and the practices sanctioned and promoted by the clerical, scholasticwing of the tradition.80 To the extent that this book is based upon texts that wereproduced by and consumed within such circles, it cooperates with such a perspec-tive; nevertheless, I am particularly concerned not to lend support to the widespreadbelief that the sophisticated Buddhist philosophical culture of highly trained monk-scholars was, to all intents and purposes, identical to Tibetan religious culture over-all. This would be misleading, for the culture of Tibet was always considerably morediversified, in both its religious and popular manifestations, than the study of its richBuddhist intellectual history alone would suggest.Historians and anthropologists, of course, have been very much aware that it hasbeen to the detriment of the study of Tibetan civilization to identify that civilizationone-sidedly with the learned dimensions of its religion: phenomena of historical andsocial importance, including often popular religious phenomena, in many cases seemto be at best only tangentially connected with materials derived from specializeddoctrinal writings, and the monastic educational traditions that favored such writ-ings.81 Nevertheless, because the learned elite was invested with great prestige andoften also with great power, symbolic or real, within the Tibetan world, it is not moreinappropriate that its manifestations should receive special emphasis in the historyof Tibetan civilization in general, than it is for us to emphasize in other settings thecontributions of rather small intellectual and religious communities.At all events, it would be an error to insist upon driving too deep a wedge herebetween adepts and scholars, or between elite and nonelite cultural formations. Ti-betan religious culture, as we have seen, sought to affirm an ideal that mended theformer divide, so that although there was real and sustained opposition, it was an op-position that in principle and in practice was regularly dissolved. The latter gulf, too,was bridged in several ways, and many of the topics discussed in this book belong infact to the common ground shared throughout much of the Tibetan cultural sphere.This was true, for instance, of the great legendary narratives of Tibet's imperial past;although only relatively small numbers of persons were familiar with the historicalaccounts of the royal dynasty, as given in the precise texts I often cite, there were never-theless innumerable retellings, in both popular religious literature and oral tradition,that were known by Tibetans of varied educational background and social status.82Besides this, there were many channels whereby elite and nonelite segments ofTibetan religious society flowed into and interacted with one another. The monasticcolleges, for instance, whatever their rapport with incarnate hierarchy or noble clans,always also had powerfully meritocratic tendencies, so that in every generation wefind monks of humble background taking their place among the most highly reveredteachers.83 At the same time, we find many instances of famed Buddhist masters tak-ing special interest in instructing persons of varied social backgrounds.84 It is impor-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"20 The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhismtant that we recall, too, in this context, the important function of fame: the epistemo-logical writings of a celebrated master like Sakya Pandita (chapter 6), for instance,were perhaps well known only in the monastic philosophical colleges, but SakyaPandita himself was universally renowned, and his fame in turn encouraged some tostudy his works and to emulate him.The formation of the Tibetan Buddhist elite, therefore, should not be seen as strictlyopposed to popular, or nonelite, Buddhism. The prestige, and in some cases the ac-tual power, derived from religious mastery—scholastic or ritual as the case may be,and preferably both at once—by the eleventh and twelfth centuries had become afundamental source of authority within the Tibetan world, with important ramifica-tions for all segments of Tibetan society, and so it continues to be.The Tibetan assimilation of Buddhism is in evidence throughout the entire range ofTibetan writing during the past millenium. Whether we turn to medical treatises,manuals of divination, law codes, or poetry, not to speak of properly religious works,we are likely to encounter at least some token of Buddhism's presence. The threetopics just surveyed briefly suggest some of the ways and means of its great diffu-sion. In the chapters that follow, I do not propose to trace that diffusion in detail—todo so would be to write an encyclopedia of Tibetan Buddhism—but I do offer somefurther sketches that will help to characterize the landscape of Buddhist thought inTibet overall."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"PART ICONVERSION AND NARRATIVE"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Chinese Mother ofTibet's Dharma-KingThe Testament of Ba and the Beginningsof Tibetan Buddhist HistoriographyWhen scholars of religion speak of conversion, we most often have an individual'sconversion in mind, and this in turn is almost always thought to involve profoundand frequently dramatic changes of personal feeling and thought. Students of lateantiquity and early medieval religions, however, must frequently attemptto understand reports of not only individual conversion, but also the conversionsof peoples, whether due to popular movements, royal fiat, or elements of both.Changes of individual feeling and thought certainly play an important role here, aswill be underscored in chapter 3, but so too do social, economic, and political phe-nomena that have perhaps only indirect relationships with individual religiousexperience. Thus, instead of personal conversion accounts, the transformations ofnational narratives must sometimes serve as the primary records of conversion tobe interpreted.1In this and the chapter that follows, it is the transformation of narratives in thewake of the adoption of Buddhism by the Tibetan court during the late eighth cen-tury that concerns us.2 After considering two episodes that reflect the manner inwhich some Tibetan Buddhists understood the conversion of the court within acentury or two thereafter, and that inform the creation of a distinctive Buddhisthistoriography in Tibet, we shall turn, in the fourth chapter, to address aspects ofthe conversion itself, attempting so far as is possible to penetrate the veil of laterlegend.History's MirrorworkIn the study of early medieval Tibet, that is, Tibet during the age of the so-calledYarlung dynasty that ruled through the mid-ninth century and its immediate after-math,3 and in many instances even when we turn to a later age, history often cannotbe clearly distinguished from legend.4 Not only are we far removed—in time, place,and the entire complex of conditions contributing to the possibilities of our under-standing—from the authors of the documents upon which our investigations rely,2"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"24 The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhismbut, in most cases, those authors were themselves far removed from the creation ofthe documents and oral traditions upon which they in turn depended.5 Indeed, notinfrequently we can be sure that there must have been many authorial acts interven-ing between the ancient events described in our sources and those sources themselves.Thus the study of early medieval Tibet may be compared without much exaggera-tion to the view from one end of a great hall of mirrors: there is little basis initiallyfor determining which of the many reflections one perceives actually originate fromthe opposite end of the hall, which only reveal persons and objects situated in theintervening corridor, which are just optical illusions, and, finally, which are in factthe observer's own reflection coming back upon himself. Some such state of affairs,of course, characterizes historical research in general, so that there is nothing veryremarkable in this regard about the study of Tibet,6 save, perhaps, for the still rela-tively slight degree to which Tibetanists have so far reflected upon it.The Tibetan hall of mirrors, however, does have some special features that cap-ture our attention at the outset. The far end appears to be closed off by a curtain,which, so far as we can tell from our vantage point, is translucent and at the sametime reflective, with several small gaps through which some parts of the enclosedhallway may be seen. Among other things, we can discern that, in the area imme-diately behind the curtain, all the mirrors are shattered. The curtain, perhaps, wasset in place by an architectural restoration firm that was never able to complete itswork.Tibetanists will perhaps understand this extended metaphor without requiringfurther interpretation, but for others, following the conventions of the allegorist, Iprovide here a key: the far end of the corridor is the history of the early medievalTibetan empire; the rubble partially visible behind the curtain is the original docu-mentation that survives—above all, the Dunhuang Tibetan manuscripts and the Cen-tral Tibetan pillar inscriptions;7 the curtain is woven of the great historical myths ofthe early empire that were elaborated in the centuries following its collapse, andthat established the patterns that would dominate all later Tibetan historiography;8its translucency represents the incorporation within these myths of authenticallyancient traditions; while its reflectivity represents the distinctive perspective of thepostimperial period during which they were redacted.Despite the elements of concealment involved here, our position now seems com-parable to that of an observer who possesses a reasonably reliable plan of large partsof the hall, and who is thus at a great advantage over one whose perspective pre-cludes even the determination of the position of the mirrors; for the Tibetanist, inmost cases, may console himself with the thought that his knowledge of the author-ship of post-eleventh-century historical works, and of the time and place of theircomposition, is in most cases sound.9 And even in the case of the anonymous his-torical writings from the early medieval period recovered at Dunhuang, we knowgenerally when they were written and, as Geza Uray has well argued, we can be rea-sonably certain in some instances that we are dealing with official records of theTibetan imperial administration.10There are, however, also cases in which the position of an entire panel within thehall gives rise to considerable uncertainty. A notable example of this is the Sba bzhed(The Testament of Ba), a famous and exceedingly influential account of the estab-lishment of Buddhism as the Tibetan state religion during the reign of Trhi Songdetsen"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Chinese Mother of Tibet's Dharma-King 25(742-c. 797), in the second half of the eighth century. Named for one or another ofthe two major actors in the story whose clan names were Ba—Ba Selnang and BaSangshi—to either of whose authorship traditional Tibetan scholars have frequentlyattributed it, the Testament ofBa is often thought to be the earliest developed histori-cal record of the period it describes that has come down to us.11 In its essence, theTestament ofBa is a narrative account of the long reign of Trhi Songdetsen, duringwhich time, we know through the two versions of the Tang Dynasty Annals (Tangshu)and the Dunhuang Tibetan documents, Tibet not only challenged Chinese powerin Inner Asia, but in 763 also succeeded briefly in occupying the Tang capital ofChang'an, and setting an emperor of Tibetan choosing upon the throne.12 From alater Tibetan perspective, however, Trhi Songdetsen is primarily famed as the mon-arch who definitively established Buddhism as the Tibetan national religion, and whoto achieve this brought the monk Santaraksita and the tantric master Padmasambhavato Tibet; founded the first Tibetan Buddhist monastery, Samye (c. 779); sponsoredcopious translations of Buddhist scriptures and commentaries; and adjudicated thedebate between the Indian philosopher KamalasTla, who was Santaraksita's leadingdisciple, and the Chinese Chan master Moheyan. It is this tale, the primary elementsof which are certainly based upon actual events, that is the central concern of theTestament ofBa.The study of the Testament ofBa and its place in Tibetan historiography thus pointsat once in two directions, according to whether we consider it in its relationship tothe beginnings of Tibetan historiography during the early medieval period so far aswe know them, or turn instead to its impact upon the works of later historians, forwhom it does often seem a virtual beginning. Seen from this dual perspective, it hasbeen clear since its first publication that the later Tibetan Buddhist historiographicaltradition, at whose inception the Testament ofBa must be situated, is in crucial re-spects discontinuous with the older traditions of Tibetan historical writing knownfrom Dunhuang.13 While much that it reports is certainly fiction, its fictions are oftenold ones, and so of considerable interest in themselves. We must, I think, accept thegeneral assessment of Stein, who has summarized his conclusions regarding theTestament ofBa in these words:It is a relatively ancient, novelized narrative of the events of the 8th century. It hasbeen obviously manipulated, but contains historical elements verified by independentand ancient sources.14In short, the Testament ofBa may be read as a work of historical fiction, which mustbe used very cautiously whenever it is precise factual information that is at issue,though it was certainly written on the basis of earlier documents that were much closerto the history it narrates.15In this and the chapter that follows, then, I shall seek to characterize more fullythe double relationship of the Testament ofBa to the period whose history it nar-rates, on the one hand, and to the later Tibetan construction of the history ofthe Buddhist conquest of the empire, on the other. While a thorough discussion ofthe questions that are raised here would require a relatively complete analysis of theTestament ofBa, and much else besides, in the present instance our reflections willbe, for the most part, limited to the consideration of just a few paradigmatic themesand episodes."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"26 The Tibetan Assimilation of BuddhismChina's NephewThe Testament ofBa opens with prophecy: in the treasury of Chimphu (the valley inwhich Samye would be situated), King Trhi Detsuktsen (705-755, a.k.a. Me Aktshom,the \"Bearded Ancestor\"), discovers a hidden testament of his ancestor, King SongtsenGampo (c. 617-649/650), engraved on a copper tablet:In the time of my descendants, in the time of a king named \"De\" (Lde), the authentic,divine doctrine will emerge, and many renunciates following the Tathagata, shavenheaded and barefoot, wearing the royal banner of ochre on their bodies, will comeforth as the objects of worship of gods and men. .. .16The king reflects that he must be the very \"De\" mentioned in the prophecy and dis-patches Trenka Muleko and Nyak Jnanakumara to India to receive the Dharma.17They go only as far as Mount Kailash, to the west of Tibet, where they meet Bud-dhagupta and Buddhasanti, two hermits, who refuse to accompany the envoys backto Central Tibet.18 They do, however, bestow on them some teachings that form thebasis for the foundation of five temples in Lhasa, Chimphu, and so on.19 The king iscriticized for this by a prominent noble, who jests that the king, given his religiosityand ugliness, really must be a brahman. Trhi Detsuktsen, annoyed by the imputa-tion, swears that, if he in fact deserves to be called a brahman, he should produce aneven uglier son with greater faith, but that if he has been an upstanding king, his sonshould be beyond ministerial reproach. His oath results in the birth to Queen Trhitsunof Jang of an exceedingly handsome prince, whose name, Jangtsha Lhawon, high-lights his superhuman good looks, \"the nephew of Jang, the heir to the gods.\"20Because the Tibetan people are said to be descended from the union of a monkeyand an ogress of the rocks,21 the king decides that no Tibetan bride can be worthy ofthe prince, and that only a Chinese princess will do, especially because the best ofhis ancestors, King Songtsen Gampo, who was Arya Avalokitesvara's emanation,22had also taken a Chinese princess (gongzhff) as his wife. Accordingly, envoys aredispatched and return sometime later with the princess of Jincheng,23 the bride cho-sen for their prince. By the time they return, however, the prince has been slain by amagical missile launched by an adept of mantras,24 and the princess is greeted not byher betrothed, but by an old graybeard (mes ag-tshom-cari), the king. She consolesherself with song and, pondering the distance both to India, where there is the Dharma,and to her homeland, sings of the sinfulness of the Tibetan ministers. The king, learn-ing of this, offers to send her back to China with lavish gifts, but the Jincheng prin-cess has now made up her own mind: one's karma cannot be overturned; she marriesthe old king. Sometime later, she rediscovers the Jowo Sakyamuni statue that herown ancestral aunt, the princess of Wencheng,25 had brought to Tibet and, moved bycompassion, institutes before it funerary rites called tshe for the Tibetan nobility.26Still later, the princess gives birth to a son in Yarning, whereupon a clairvoyantChinese Buddhist monk declares to the king, who is dwelling in Drakmar at the time,27that this is certainly a bodhisattva. But by the time the king arrives to see his newson, the baby has been stolen by one of the co-wives, Zhiteng of the powerful Nanamclan, who declares the boy to be her own.

In my estimation, perhaps owing to thework's archaicism, and also to the prejudgement involved in the classification of itas a book of \"history,\" its extraordinary achievement as a relatively early work ofTibetan literature has not been sufficiently appreciated. It will emerge, in fact, thatthis is an essential key to advancing our understanding of it.First, however, let us return to the episode just related, and see what other sourceshave to tell us about these events.Tibet's SonAccording to the account found in many of the well-Tibetan historiesproduced from the twelfth century onward,29 Trhi Songdetsen was the son of TrhiDetsuktsen and his Chinese bride, the Jincheng Gongzhu. She was, according to thesame traditions, in fact brought to Tibet to marry the crown prince, Jangtsha Lhawon,whose untimely death required that she marry his father instead. Her child is said tohave been stolen from her by her co-wife of the Tibetan Nanam clan and to havebecome known as Trhi Songdetsen. Some versions of the tale add that the princess'sdiscovery that she was to marry not a handsome, young prince, but instead an oldgraybeard explains Trhi Detsuktsen's epithet, Me Aktshom, \"Bearded Ancestor,\" andthat the princess recovered her son after his abduction by the Nanam queen follow-ing a Solomonic judgement of her rightful claim of maternity.30 Of course, if this allnow seems familiar, it is because the entire later Tibetan historical tradition resortsto the authority of the Testament ofBa regarding these matters. A brief version of thestory first became well known to Western scholars through Obermiller's 1932 transla-tion of the history of the famous fourteenth-century polymath, Buton Rinchendrup(129G-1364).31Twenty years after Obermiller's publication of Buton's account, the incomparablePaul Demieville, in an article-length footnote, demonstrated that the tale found therewas most unlikely to be at all true.32 We shall consider the entire matter in more detailas we proceed, but suffice it here to mention just these points noted by Demieville:that the Old Tibetan Annals from Dunhuang, which had become known through thepioneering 1940 edition and translation of Bacot, Thomas, and Toussaint, give theyear of the Chinese princess's death as 739, her funeral as 741, and the birth of TrhiSongdetsen as 742,33 and that the general correlations between the dates found in"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Chinese Mother of Tibet's Dharma-King 29this document and those given in the two versions of the Tang Dynasty Annals tendedto support its veracity.34 Moreover, the Dunhuang geneological table, also first stud-ied in the publication just mentioned, states flatly that Trhi Songdetsen was the sonof the Nanam queen.35 Finally, Demieville takes stock of the pronouncedly anti-Chinese standpoint attributed by later Tibetan historians to Trhi Songdetsen andsuggests that this circumstantially calls into question the traditions regarding hisChinese matriliny.36 But here we must remark that if Demieville is correct about thislast point, we also have good grounds for doubting that the very Tibetan historianswho attributed this sinophobia to one of the great Tibetan culture heroes would haveso cheerfully countenanced a Chinese maternal line for him, so long as a Tibetan aris-tocratic line, that of the Nanam clan, was also available to them.37 The account is thusan inherently conflicted one, and it is this that calls for our deeper consideration.The relationship between the Chinese princess and Trhi Songdetsen is only oneof many difficulties one encounters in the study of the early sources: careful com-parison of the Dunhuang Tibetan documents, the two versions of the Tang DynastyAnnals, and the later Tibetan histories reveals numerous inconsistencies in the ac-counts of the reign of Trhi Detsuktsen and the succession of his son Trhi Songdetsen.For present purposes, however, we may forego the detailed study of the eighth-century Tibetan monarchy that examination of this material would require and in-stead briefly summarize some relevant conclusions of earlier scholarship.With regard to the basic tale of the princess's arrival in Tibet, the premature deathof her betrothed, and her marriage instead to his father, the old king, the JapaneseTibetanist Yamaguchi Zuiho has fairly demonstrated that something like this did infact occur, but to a different princess, during the reign of another king, some sixdecades before:38 the Tang princess of Wencheng was recorded in the annals fromDunhuang to have arrived in Tibet to marry, not the great emperor Songtsen Gampo,but his son, in whose favor the monarch abdicated. Upon the son's death soon afterascending the throne, however, Songtsen returned to rule and married his daughter-in-law, too. Yamaguchi argues that the author of our tale was simply in error in trans-ferring the episode to the princess of Jincheng. In this, he is no doubt correct, but onewonders why such an error became the authoritative tale that it did, embellished witha Tibetan version of the judgement of Solomon. Something more than a mere mix-up is surely at stake here.Christopher Beckwith, a scholar of early Tibetan history, has advanced a compli-cated and intriguing argument that addresses this issue. He believes that the severalincidents of crisis in the succession of the monarchy during the early eighth centurysuggest that it faced grave obstacles to maintaining its claims of legitimacy. TrhiSongdetsen's adoption of a universal religion, Buddhism, his construction of theSamye monastery, with what Beckwith rightly terms its \"kosmokrator symbolism,\"and the later attribution to him of maternal descent from the Chinese imperial linemay all be seen as part of an effort to restore the dynasty's shaken credibility.39 Thereare two important points, I think, that should be stressed here: first, despite the sev-eral documented crises of the early eighth century, it is by no means clear that themonarchy was in fact challenged by the accusation of illegitimacy. Second, there isno evidence whatever suggesting that the tale of the emperor's birth to a Chineseprincess came into circulation while the empire still held sway.40 On the contrary,the imperial record is quite clear in maintaining that Trhi Songdetsen was the son of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"30 The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhismthe Tibetan Nanam queen, and almost contemporary Chinese records are equally clearabout this.41To understand, therefore, why later Tibetan historians chose in this case to pub-lish not the truth but a legend, we must turn to consider the episode from anotherperspective.Solomon on the Silk RoadBegging the indulgence of my readers, I propose that we embark at this point on adetour into the no-man's land between historical scholarship and historical fiction, aterrain that we've been skirting all along in any case.The Testament ofBa opens with a Solomonic judgement regarding disputed ma-ternity; it culminates in a blow-by-blow description of the construction of the Samyetemple, lovingly describing the preparation of building materials and the temple'sintricate iconography; and it reaches its denouement in the schism between Chineseand Indian Buddhism in Tibet.42 Now, described in this way, the Testament ofBa atonce appears to bear an uncanny resemblance to the First Book of Kings, which openswith Solomon's judgment, culminates in the construction of the first temple, andreaches its denouement in the division of the kingdom. This raises a fascinating, ifseemingly loony, question: is there even a shadow of a possibility that 1 Kings mighthave indirectly inspired the Testament ofBa! Of course, the indisputable facts—thatthe monastery of Samye was founded during Trhi Songdetsen's reign, and that therewas some sort of dispute between Chinese and Indian Buddhist factions, as well asmany telltale points of detail, such as the Testament ofBa's account of a meetingwith the Korean Chan master Kim in Chengdu43—rule out the possibility of specu-lating that the Testament ofBa might be a wholesale confabulation based upon aforeign model; but this does not preclude the possibility that the author used a for-eign model to help structure and embellish a tale, some of which was indeedfactually accurate. Other examples of this are not unknown: for instance, TsuguhitoTakeuchi has established beyond reasonable doubt that something of this sort wasprecisely what took place in the composition of the Old Tibetan Chronicle fromDunhuang, where the author reworked for his own purposes a passage from the Shijiof the great Chinese historian Sima Qian.44 Thus there is no question but that thearsenal of early Tibetan literary technique included the appropriation of foreign nar-rative frames for the elaboration of Tibetan stories. The question therefore inevita-bly arises: what may the Tibetans of the early medieval period have known of theBible?In fact, Tibetan literature does include any number of what at first glance appearpossibly to be Bible stories: Per Kvaerne has remarked on the resemblance betweenthe tale of the translator Vairocana' s unfortunate encounter with the queen Tshe-pongza and the episode of Joseph and Potiphar's wife;45 in an episode in the Yar-lung Jo-bo 'i Chos- 'byung (The Yarlung Lord's History of the Doctrine), a new starappearing at the birth of the boy who would later become the first king of the West-ern Xia dynasty is taken as an evil omen by the astrologers of the Chinese court,whereupon the emperor commands a slaughter of male infants;46 and, in the histori-cal and legendary traditions of the Nyingmapa school, Garap Dorje, who is virtually"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Chinese Mother of Tibet's Dharma-King 31a savior figure, is born to a virgin, deposited at birth in a pit where he is protectedand worshipped by deities, and, while still a child, goes to the temple to debate withthe wise.47 But, as Kvaerne has convincingly demonstrated, it is almost certainly anIndian tale that figures in the background of the story of Vairocana. And none of theother examples seem so compelling as to eliminate the possibility that there werealternative, even if not yet identified, sources of inspiration, or independent originsof some of these motifs among the Tibetans themselves.Nevertheless, we should note too that the transmission of biblical lore to Tibetduring the age in question cannot quite be ruled out: assuming that the military con-frontation between Arabs and Tibetans during the eighth century did not result inIslam's becoming a source of Tibetan knowledge of Western religious tradition,48there were still three other possible sources of such knowledge available to the Ti-betans during the period concerned, namely, Nestorian Christians, Manichaeans, andJewish merchants operating along the Silk Road.Nestorianism and Manichaeism had become major religious movements in InnerAsia during the Tang period and were to remain important there until the ChinggisKhanite invasions of the early thirteenth century.49 What's more, the researchesof Tucci, Stein, and Uray have established that there were both Nestorian and Mani-chaean contacts with Tibet, that adherents of these religions may have even madea bid to convert the Tibetans, and that the Tibetans were to some extent at least fa-miliar with them.50 Significantly, in the case of Manichaeism, we even have goodreason to believe that King Trhi Songdetsen himself knew of its denunciation inChina.51 The possibility that Nestorian or Manichaean motifs might turn up in an-cient Tibetan sources is thus one that no student of early Tibetan cultural history willdismiss out of hand.Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that the events narrated in Kings or Chronicleswould have been among biblical traditions widely transmitted by either Nestoriansor Manichaeans. Though Inner Asian and Chinese Nestorians did sometimes useHebrew personal names—there was even a Chinese priest named Solomon52—theextent of their knowledge of the history of Israel remains unclear. Catholic visi-tors to the court of the Khans during the thirteenth century reported that, while theNestorians possessed the entire biblical text in Syriac, they understood little of itscontents.53 This may well have been a sectarian calumny, but even if true duringthe thirteenth century we have little idea whether or to what extent it can be readback into the eighth. Boris Marshak has shown that the scene of Joshua at the gatesof Jericho was a royal emblem of the Nestorian Karluks, who depicted it on exqui-site silver medallions,54 and much evidence shows that the Karluks had extensive,though often antagonististic, relations with the Tibetans.55 Beyond such slendermarkers, however, the trail apparently grows cold.The Manichaeans for their part, though certainly familiar with elements of NewTestament lore, seem not to have known much of the traditions of Israel, exceptingthe tale of the creation, and perhaps some apocrypha such as the Book of Enoch.56The evidence as we know it offers nothing to support the supposition that any sig-nificant Manichaean transmission of Hebrew lore occurred in Inner Asia generally,much less in Tibet in particular.Aurel Stein's discovery at the Dandan-Oilik site in Khotan of an eighth-centuryJudeo-Persian merchantile document provided the first proof positive of a Jewish"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"32 The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhismpresence in an area that was intermittently under Tibetan sway during the age withwhich we are concerned.57 It remains a mystery just how extensive that presence was,or what the nature of these Central Asian Jewish merchants' contact, if any, may havebeen with the Tibetans who sometimes ruled the territories which they traversed. ButPelliot's discovery at Dunhuang of a Hebrew penitential prayer, with references toPsalms and to the Prophets, and now attributed to the ninth or perhaps the tenth cen-tury, leads us to posit sustained, even if low-level, Jewish Silk Road activity.58 It seemsnot unreasonable to assume that Jewish merchants plying the Silk Road would havebeen, like Jewish merchants in other parts of the medieval world, generally knowl-edgeable about the history of Israel;59 and the traditions of Solomon and the firsttemple were, of course, prominent features of that history. Whether that knowledgewould have been communicated to non-Jews, however, is an altogether differentmatter. I should note, too, that in the records of medieval Jewish travelers with whichI have become acquainted so far, Tibet is not mentioned prior to the twelfth century,and that in a reference not suggesting direct contact,60 though an early ninth-centuryArabic writer does explicitly associate Jewish mercantile activity in the farther eastwith the musk trade, and musk was a peculiarly Tibetan commodity.61 At the sametime, we have no evidence that the Tibetans knew anything of Judaism, or of theJews as a distinct people, before our own age, unless we were to admit in this con-text, as certainly we should not, the disguised occurence of the names Adam andMoses in the Kalacakratantra (and even this would be too late for the purposes ofthe present discussion).62 From all this we may conclude that, though there well couldhave been some knowledge of Hebrew historical tradition among the Jews who jour-neyed along the fringes of the late first-millenium Tibetan world, and perhaps amongtheir Nestorian contemporaries as well, we are not entitled to posit any more thanthat bare possibility, and even so there is no suggestion that such knowledge wasever transmitted to Tibet.If this brief inquiry into the prospects for locating a biblical model for the Testa-ment ofBa has drawn a blank, however, let us not conclude that the detour was fruit-less. For, though there was probably no historical connection that would account forthe superficial similarities between 1 Kings and the Testament ofBa, even if, in thecase of the maternity dispute, there is one very striking resemblance, reflection aboutthis still discloses an historiographical analogy between them. It is this, I believe,that will help us to make sense of our earliest elaborate history of Buddhism inTibet.The Religious Transformation of HistoryIn his Sather Lectures, Arnaldo Momigliano, certainly the most incisive recent in-terpreter of ancient historiography, wrote:In pre-exilic times the Jews had had chronicles of their kings. The author or authorsof the present Books of Kings used them. But the Books of Kings we read now arenot comparable with the ordinary Royal Chronicles we know from Assyria and mustassume to have existed in Persia. The Books of Kings are a record of events connectedwith the relationship between Jehovah and the Hebrew nation as a whole. This of course"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Chinese Mother of Tibet's Dharma-King 33applies even more to the definite postexilic products which we call the Books of Ezraand Nehemiah and Chronicles. These are histories of a religious society. Two or threecenturies later the author of the First Book of Maccabees showed that this tradition ofthe political and religious historian was still alive among the Jews.63This is perhaps not a good example of the great distinctiveness of scholarly vision thatcharacterizes much of Momigliano's work; his description here of Deuteronomistichistoriography conforms well with prevailing views. Herbert Butterfield, for instance,expresses a similar orientation in slightly different terms when he writes:To a considerable extent [Judges and Kings] represent what is really a commentary,or something like a sermon, on the history of the monarchy.... [I]n fact, the straightnarrative history—of which there must have existed a great amount—has largely dis-appeared. What survives is a specialised kind of religious meditation on parts of thestory.64Keeping these thoughts before us, and recalling, too, what was said earlier of theinsufficient attention that has been paid to the Testament ofBa as a literary text, itbecomes clear, I think, that the halting progress Tibetanists have made towards achiev-ing an adequate assessment of the Testament ofBa so far has been due in part to anexaggerated emphasis upon its place as a book of history, despite the reservationsof R. A. Stein and others about this. It is, however, no doubt best regarded as, inButterfield's phrase, \"a specialised kind of religious meditation on parts of the story\"of Trhi Songdetsen's career, one that indeed seeks to advance the rudiments of adistinctively Buddhist interpretation of Tibetan history in general. Seen from thisperspective, it appears that the Testament ofBa is among the first of a line of Tibetanwritings, culminating in the great legendary accounts of imperial Tibet, the produc-tion of which reached its apogee during the twelfth through the fourteenth centuries,with such apocryphal works as the Mani Bka'-'bum (The Mani Kambum) and theseveral versions of the Padma bka'-thang (The Testimonial Record of Padma-sambhava), but including also some works often thought of simply as \"histories,\"like the Rgyal-rabs gsal-ba'i me-long (The Mirror Clarifying Royal Geneology). Inconnection with the Mani Kambum (twelfth-thirteenth centuries), for instance, acompilation focusing upon King Songtsen Gampo as the embodiment of the bod-hisattva Avalokitesvara, we find the elaboration, in the absence of the order pro-vided by an actual monarchy, of a vision of a world ordered by the agency of thebuddhas and bodhisattvas, a vision that was projected back upon the earlier monar-chy itself. What these books achieve is to engender an understanding of Tibet and itsplace in the world, according to which the destiny of the Buddha's teaching and thatof the Tibetan people themselves are realized to be inextricably interlinked. (This isa topic to which we shall return in chapter 8.) It is by placing the Testament ofBawithin the context of the religio-historical polemic that was elaborated by TibetanBuddhists in the early postimperial period, and not by reference to supposed prob-lems of legitimation while the empire still held sway, or to simple confusion aboutthe historical record, that we can begin to formulate an adequate interpretation of theTibetan monarch's contested maternity.The Testament ofBa offers us a number of themes that merit consideration in thisconnection: three that are closely interrelated, and that may help to shed some lighton its tale of the emperor's maternity, are its treatment of the question of karma and"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"34 The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhismrebirth, its view of Tibet as a stage for the dramatic activity of bodhisattvas, and itsremarkable emphasis on the Chinese role in the buddhicization of Tibet.(1) The first of these will be a central theme in the following chapter, and so I willsay only a few words about it here: the Dunhuang Tibetan documents provide strik-ing evidence of the active promotion of the Buddhist teachings of karma and samsaraamong the Tibetans during the last centuries of the first millenium. The implicationof the texts concerned seems to be that these doctrines were to some extent still con-tested or were at least felt in some ways to be problematic. Though emphatic propa-gation of the karma-samsara cosmology would always remain a prominent dimen-sion of Tibetan Buddhist doctrinal instruction, in both its popular and scholastic facets,later Tibetan historians mostly seem to have forgotten that the conceptions of karmaand samsara were once controversial.65Not so in the case of the Testament ofBa. It is noteworthy that this work, almostuniquely among the narratives of Tibet's conversion, stresses precisely the central-ity of karma and samsara as contested categories.66 Indeed, this is one of the featuresof the Testament ofBa that convinces me that, even if the author did not witness theevents related therein, the book must nevertheless be relatively ancient.67(2) A corollary to the Testament ofBa's promotion of the karma-samsara frameworkis its insistence upon the dynamic role of the bodhisattvas as agents of salvation withinthat framework, and, what is more, upon Tibet itself as a field for the activity of suchagents. The Testament ofBa is among the relatively early works that clearly formu-late King Songtsen Gampo' s bodhisattvahood,68 and, as we have seen, a Chinese monkannounces Trhi Songdetsen' s similar status at the time of his birth.69 Later in the book,Santaraksita, at his first meeting with the Tibetan minister Ba Selnang, states that he,Selnang, and the king form what amounts to a bodhisattvic triumvirate whose task isto guarantee the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet through the foundation of theSamye monastery, a theme that would come to be greatly elaborated in later litera-ture.70 Again, the examples can be multiplied, and, as before, it seems plausible toread the Testament ofBa not as a naive historical romance carelessly repeating es-tablished tradition, but as a work that seeks to create a well-formed historical vision,according to which the historical destiny of Tibet is bound to the salvific activity ofbodhisattvas. If the Mani Kambum represents a relatively advanced vision of theconstitution of Tibet as a fundamentally spiritual polity, the Testament ofBa may beregarded as a surviving rough draft on the way to that policy statement.(3) As Demieville remarked, later Tibetan sources sometimes impute a pronouncedlyanti-Chinese stance to the reign of Trhi Songdetsen. The main reason for this im-pression, which indeed has its apparent origin in the Testament ofBa, is the tradi-tional tale of the confrontation between Heshang Moheyan and Santaraksita'sleading Indian disciple, Kamalaslla.71 Their debate culminates in a royal decisionauthorizing Tibetans to adhere to the Indian tradition, while commanding the sup-pression of Chinese Buddhism. In fact, the Testament ofBa is not so clear on thispoint as it might at first seem, for it is altogether ambiguous about whether it is Chi-nese Buddhism in general that was condemned, or only the particular tradition pro-pounded by Moheyan. Though it does seem strongly to suggest that the condemna-tion entailed a general recall of Chinese Buddhist books throughout the country, it"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Chinese Mother of Tibet's Dharma-King 35specifies that those books were then concealed in the treasury of Samye, emphati-cally not destroyed.72But, with the sole exception of the Samye debate, the Testament ofBa takes whatappears to be an entirely favorable position with respect to the influence of ChineseBuddhism in Tibet: the princess of Jincheng and the Heshang who declares TrhiSongdetsen to be a bodhisattva are only two among the half dozen or so ChineseBuddhist protagonists who play noteworthy roles,73 and, with the exception ofMoheyan and his cohorts, these figures are positively valued by the author of theTestament ofBa. Indeed, the Testament ofBa's emphasis on these persons and theirfine contributions to the Dharma in Tibet apparently puts the lie to any stereotypingof early Tibetan Buddhist historiography as one-sidedly anti-Chinese.74The author of the Testament ofBa was perhaps also aware of materials such asthe so-called Dbon-zhang-rdo-ring (The Nephew-Uncle Pillar Inscription), whichpreserves the Sino-Tibetan treaty of 821/822 in both Tibetan and Chinese and em-phasizes the quasi-familial relationship that had been established between theChinese emperor and the Tibetan monarch.75 The author of the inscription, TrhiSongdetsen's grandson Trhi Tsukdetsen (Relpacen, d. 838), records there that theirrelationship of uncle and nephew had been established by his ancestor SongtsenGampo's marriage to the Wencheng Gongzhu and his great-grandfather TrhiDetsuktsen's to the Jincheng Gongzhu, and that this relationship, despite the un-fortunate fact that \"now and then the frontier ministers on both sides caused somemischief,\"76 had been maintained by the successive Tibetan monarchs down to andincluding himself. The convention that the rulers of China and Tibet were thus re-lated as uncle and nephew may have provided one additional and, given the othermaterials we have considered, possibly compelling reason for the author of the Tes-tament of Ba to think of the king as having been, quite literally, the \"nephew ofChina.\"77 Indeed, it is not unimaginable that the entire story originated withsomeone's reading a double entendre into lines 33-34 of the East Inscription, whichbegin,And since they [the Chinese and Tibetan emperors] were thus connected as kins-men, the Tsenpo my father, the miraculously wise divinity Trhi Songdetsenhimself, formed his firm resolution in strict accord with that relationship ofNephew and Uncle. ...78To restate these points in precise relation to the question of Trhi Songdetsen'smaternity, it appears likely that the princess of Jincheng had become a heroine forTibetan Buddhists during the later imperial period and immediately thereafter: shewas remembered for having promoted Buddhist funerary rites among the nobilityeven before the conversion of the Tibetan court, and thus to have adopted a definitestance in the internal Tibetan debate on the contested issues surrounding mortuaryritual and the Buddhist cosmology of karma and samsara. Though not explicitly re-ferred to as a bodhisattva, at least in the Testament ofBa, she was therefore nonethe-less viewed as an agent of the Buddha's teaching, and indeed as one of a number ofChinese missionaries and masters who had helped to secure the ascendancy of theDharma in Tibet. Given the established euphemism that the Chinese emperor andthe Tibetan Tsenpo were related as uncle and nephew, it now involved but a smallstep to think of her as the true mother of Tibet's Dharma-king."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"36 The Tibetan Assimilation of BuddhismAnd to all this we must add that there was indeed a Buddhist, and not a biblicaltale, available to be employed in the elaboration of the Testament of Bo's account,for the story of the contested maternity and its Solomonic resolution is known in thePali tradition from the commentary on the Mahommaggajataka and is familiar to manystudents of the Pali language from Andersen's Pali Reader, where it bears the title\"Mahosadha's Judgement.\"79 That a variant of the same story was also found in aTibetan canonical version was first reported to Western folklorists in an almost for-gotten St. Petersburg publication of the 1880s, a collection of tales from the TibetanVinaya translated into German by Anton Schiefner, that also appeared some yearslater in an English translation.80 The text in question had been translated from San-skrit into Tibetan during the reign of Trhi Songdetsen.81In sum, the author of the Testament ofBa (or his source) had appropriated a ca-nonical Buddhist tale to justify a claimed Buddhist geneology for a Buddhist king.History and IdentityIn his intricate and intriguing study of the formation of our modern identity, Sourcesof the Self, Charles Taylor briefly criticizes the arguments of Derek Parfit and othercontemporary heirs to the empriricist tradition who hold, in a manner suggestive ofBuddhist Abhidharmika philosophy, that \"personal identity\" is a metaphysical illu-sion, that there is no necessary and sufficient condition of our ongoing identity throughtime. He maintains that \"[i]t seems clear .. . that there is something like an a prioriunity of a human life through its whole extent\" and insists thatas a being who grows and becomes I can only know myself through the history of mymaturations and regressions, overcomings and defeats. My self-understanding neces-sarily has temporal depth and incorporates narrative.82This is not the occasion for detailed examination of the philosophical puzzles of iden-tity; my point in introducing Taylor's remarks in this context is to note that whateverit is that \"is something like an a priori unity of a human life through its whole extent\"is something we seek in, or project upon, not only our own lives, but also the storiesof our clans, tribes, and nations. That is to say, through our narratives we do not justorient ourselves to the world, but in large measure we create the very world to whichwe orient ourselves. It has been the task of every author of national history to domuch more than describe the facts;83 for national history underwrites, at least amongthose who belong to or feel strong affinity with the nation in question, the sense thatone participates in a community in which certain desirable values may be actualized.The values and ends that seem possible objects of individual striving are preciselythose engendered by the world in which the individual lives and acts, and that worldis in turn engendered by its past, present, and possible actors.Geza Uray has argued that the old Tibetan royal annals, represented in fragmen-tary form by the Old Tibetan Annals and Chronicle from Dunhuang, served as in-struments of bureaucratic practice and of the art of government.84 Their developmentcoincided with and reflected the organization of the empire during the period ofexpansion beginning in the mid-seventh century. We may add that, with the fall ofthe empire during the ninth century, Tibetans were faced not only with a practical"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Chinese Mother of Tibet's Dharma-King 37political and economic crisis, but, as are all those whose communities experiencegreat and traumatic change, with a crisis of understanding as well. The sophisticatedcosmology and soteriology of Buddhism provided one possible way of making senseof the Tibetan world as a domain of meaningful agency and possible excellence, whichbegan during and continued even after its tryst with imperial greatness. The stun-ning achievement of Tibetan Buddhist historians was to create a compelling andenduring articulation of this vision, and it is to the author of the Testament ofBa thatwe owe what was perhaps its first full, and for Tibetans still vital, formulation."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Mark of VermilionRebirth and Resurrection in anEarly Medieval Talei we have seen in the previous chapter, it has long been evident that Tibetan his-torical traditions concerning the first millennium of the common era contain muchin the way of self-contradiction, factual inaccuracy, legend, and sheer fancy. Whilecontemporary academic historians of Tibet have generally felt it their charge to getat the facts of the matter to the extent possible, it has sometimes not been sufficientlyconsidered that the apparent inaccuracies, legends, and fancies are among the factsof the matter. Tibetan historians without doubt often published legends, where wewould prefer to find truth according to our own lights; but our task is not solely topick away at what they wrote, for the legends themselves, above and beyond thequestions that may be raised concerning the literal veracity of their affirmations anddenials, were proposed and became authoritative in response to genuinely obtainingstates of affairs in the communities in which they were elaborated. In short, theTibetanist must strive to illuminate not only Tibetan history, but Tibetan historiog-raphy as well.The Mark of VermilionEarly on in the Sba-bzhed (The Testament of Ba), the same work we have describedearlier, while recounting the events leading up to Trhi Songdetsen's adoption ofBuddhism, there is a lovely tale concerning a great tragedy in the household of theminister Ba Selnang, and its ultimately happy outcome.1 The text recalls that duringthe repression of Buddhism that followed the death of Emperor Trhi Detsuktsen, whenhis successor, Trhi Songdetsen, was still in his minority, the performance of Bud-dhist funerary rites was suppressed. These rites, as we have seen, had been institutedby the late emperor's Chinese bride, the princess of Jincheng. After her arrival inTibet, during a visit to the image of Sakyamuni that had been installed in Lhasa byher distant ancestral relation, the princess of Wencheng, she had been moved bycompassion for the fate of the deceased Tibetan nobility, who died without benefitof the Buddha's teaching. The rites she instituted, to be performed on a weekly basis3"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Mark of Vermilion 39for seven weeks following a death, were known as tshe. As Stein has argued, this iscertainly not the familiar Tibetan term for \"lifespan\" that occurs in the names of rit-uals of longevity (tshe-sgrub, tshe-dbang) and in a common generic term for funeraryrituals, literally, \"rites for those whose lifespan has passed\" (tshe- 'das-kyi cho-ga).Rather, it is most likely a transcription of the Chinese zhai, defined in the dictionar-ies as \"a fast of abstinence,\" as in the idiom dazhai, \"to perform rituals to deliversouls in purgatory,\" and in other Chinese Buddhist expressions.2 The Testament ofBa holds that these rites were specifically banned by ministerial decree.Now, it is at this time, just following the proclamation of the ban, that both of BaSelnang's children, a boy and girl, suddenly die. Ba becomes very much preoccu-pied with the truth or falsehood of Buddhist notions of rebirth and seeks the counselof an elderly Chinese monk, who assures him that the Buddhist teachings about thesematters are true.3 He arranges for the monk to perform the last rites in the family'sprivate quarters in secret, while a Bon funeral—that is to say, a funeral according tothe pre-Buddhist rites of Tibet4—is staged at the entrance to the household as a ruse.When the monk asks whether the minister wishes his children to return as gods or ashuman beings, Ba chooses divine rebirths for them, but his wife wishes them to re-turn as her own children once more. To console both, the monk suggests that he leadthe son to a godly realm, but that the daughter take birth in the family again. As heperforms the ceremony, there is a miraculous transformation of the son's remainsinto sariram, relics,5 indicating his rebirth as a god. The monk then takes a pearl,smears it with a solution of vermilion, and places it in the left cheek of the mouth ofthe daughter's corpse. After the monk performs a ritual \"as a mark of faith,\" the in-fant is placed in an urn and buried beneath her mother's bed. Months later, a child isborn into the family with a pearl in its mouth spotted red; the urn is disinterred andfound to be empty. When the child completes her first year,6 she recognizes placesand persons she has seen before, without having been instructed about them. In thisway, Ba Selnang comes to see for himself the truth of the doctrine of rebirth, and hesecretly requests instruction in meditation from the Chinese monk.In the light of what we already know of the Testament ofBa, we would be war-ranted to regard this tale of the vermilion-marked pearl simply as one of its severalfictions, possibly a quaint bit of folklore, but certainly not history in anything but aeuphemistic sense. Very well, but we may still ask whether it is a fiction that in somefashion reflects or responds to circumstances that actually obtained in eighth-centuryTibet, or whether it is perhaps a tale borrowed from some other source or one com-posed at some other time, and thus possibly alien even to the period it purports todescribe.Recently, in an exceptional article, A.-M. Blondeau has described a group of rit-uals specially practiced in connection with the death of neonates and has shown thatsuch rituals certainly form the background for the tale of Ba's daughter.7 In brief,the deceased child is either regarded as a bearer of the family's wealth and goodfortune, so that its corpse is mummified and kept, sometimes in the wall of the house,so as to preserve those blessings despite the infant's untimely passing, or else it is aquestion of securing the child's rebirth in the same family, in which case the corpseis preserved only temporarily, and it is marked with various substances and designs—in one version a vermilion solution is used to paint its palms.8 The reborn child willhave birthmarks resembling the markings applied to its past embodiment's corpse, a"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"40 Conversion and Narrativephenomenon attested in an event recounted by no less than the present Dalai Lama.9We may note, however, that the motif of the vermilion-marked pearl in the mouth, astriking image in the Testament ofBa's account, is nowhere to be found in the fasci-nating documentation assembled by Blondeau.While I have not located a sure model for the tale of the vermilion-marked pearlthat would support the suggestion that it might have been more or less directly bor-rowed from either a specific ritual practice or an earlier literary account, I suspectthat the symbolism of the pearl, as it is used here, is of non-Tibetan inspiration. Theforeignness of the pearl is underscored by the word for \"pearl\" in Tibetan, mu-tig,from Sanskrit mukta, though this is no doubt an old loan that may well have beennaturalized in Tibetan long before the eighth century. Hans Jonas, in his study of the\"Hymn of the Pearl\" found in the Acts of the Apostle Thomas, shows that in Gnosticlore the pearl had come to symbolize the soul, pure in its essential nature, that wasnevertheless now mired in the darkness of the world.10 As such, it is an image alsoknown from Manichaean documents, including the hymn cycle Angad RoSnan, inwhich the doctrine of rebirth is explicitly discussed.11 The manuscript of this workwas found at Turfan, in contemporary Xinjiang, and so was transmitted in regionsthat fell close to the sphere of imperial Tibet, where, as Stein and Uray have demon-strated, Manichaeism was certainly to some extent known (see ch. 2, n. 50). More-over, as will be seen below (p. 192), there are striking parallels between the \"Hymnof the Pearl\" itself and certain allegories of the Tibetan Great Perfection tradition,and, as will become clear later in this chapter, this association with the Great Perfec-tion is itself highly suggestive in this instance. Nevertheless, despite the obvious simi-larity of symbolism, taken very generally, there is no compelling resemblance be-tween the specific imagery of the pearl in the Gnostic and Manichaean hymns andthat of the tale we are now considering. Those conversant with Indian ayurvedic andtantric lore may also find the vermilion-marked pearl reminiscent of the descriptionsin Indian embryology of the intermingling of blood and semen at the moment ofconception, though I am not aware of actual reference in India to the pearl as a sym-bol in this context.12Still, though I have not yet encountered a Chinese version of our story, my sup-position is that, if there indeed is a foreign model for the motif of the pearl placed inthe mouth, it is most likely Chinese. Those familiar with the sculpted lions and drag-ons that adorn traditional Chinese temples and palaces will recognize that the imageof the gem in the mouth is an important symbol of wealth, good fortune, and power.13In a Chinese folktale that I know only through a recent source, a primer of literaryChinese published early in this century, there is a discussion of a wondrous pearlbrought from the West, about which it is said that, \"By keeping it in the mouth onecan have no thirst\" (hdn zhi ke bu fa?).14 The character that means \"to hold in themouth\" (hdn) in this phrase is also employed in the composition of a homonym (hdn)that refers specifically to the insertion of gems into the mouths of corpses.15 As theevidence derived from the former Han dynasty tombs makes clear, this was a well-established custom in ancient times, though the gem in question was generally a jadetablet, not a pearl.16There is an additional reason, indeed a puzzling one, for suspecting some elementof Chinese inspiration to be at work here; for the Chinese pearl really appears to in-clude a mark of vermilion, that is, the character for \"pearl,\" zhu, combines the jade-"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Mark of Vermilion 41radical (yu), its semantic component, with the character for vermilion, zhu, as itsphonetic. Though we must entertain the possibility that this is merely coincidental,still, given the Testament ofBa's many incorporations elsewhere of materials that inone way or another point back to China, even though it is clear that the Testament ofBa's author often either misunderstands or deliberately misconstrues these mate-rials,17 we cannot rule out the possibility that the odd convergence of the structure ofa symbolic motif with that of a Chinese graph may be something more than chance.Suggestive, too, in this context, is the notion of the cinnibar elixir pearl (dan-zhu),related to alchemical means to achieve bodily immortality and found in early Taoistsources as the proper name for a divinity residing in the mouth.18Clearly, then, the motif of the gem placed in the mouth of the dead points to Chi-nese inspiration, especially given the officiating role of the Chinese monk and theperformance of the Chinese Buddhist memorial fast. Nevertheless, the smear of ver-milion equally echoes more ancient Tibetan practices, which remain current, as wehave seen, in the rituals discussed by Blondeau. We may add that it is well knownthat the Tibetans once painted their faces with vermilion; the Khotanese in fact calledthem \"red-faces,\"19 and the practice was also described by the Chinese.20 The cus-tom is said to have been proscribed by the kings at the urgings of the Tang princessesbrought to Tibet, who detested it.21 Also significant for us here is the testimony ofthe Old Tibetan Chronicle from Dunhuang, which records that the face of the king'scorpse was to be painted with vermilion in preparation for its entombment.22Whatever the exact origins of the several motifs it employs, it seems plausiblethat the story of Ba Selnang's conversion does include some elements indicating thata recollection of actual circumstances in Tibet's early history is invoked here, how-ever indistinctly. In sum, there can be no doubt that Ba Selnang was an historicalfigure and that he was to play a great role in the eighth-century establishment ofBuddhism as the state religion of Tibet. A manuscript from Dunhuang (IO 689/2),which has been relatively well studied,23 lists him according to his religious name ofYeshewangpo as the first in an enumeration of Tibetans in the lineage of Santaraksita,and according to the Testament ofBa's account, it was Ba Selnang who first met thatmaster in Nepal, and who later was among the first Tibetans to receive monasticordination from him.24 Moreover, much of the available documentation affirms thatTrhi Songdetsen came to the throne (in 755/756) during a phase of anti-Buddhistreaction.25 That phase, however, appears to have been entered more than a decadebefore, even prior to his birth, at the time of the death, significantly, of the princessof Jincheng in 739. Invaluable evidence about the decease of the princess and thepersecution that followed comes from the histories and prophecies of Buddhism inKhotan found in several Tibetan versions at Dunhuang and in the later Tibetan canons,which have had a long history of study in the West.26 A manuscript found by Pelliottells us:At about that time [during the events in Khotan described earlier in the text] the di-vine Tsenpo of Tibet and the lord of China formed [the relationship of] nephew anduncle, at which the Chinese princess, too, became the divine Tsenpo's bride. TheChinese princess built one great temple in Tibet and established its provisions. Thewhole samgha went there, whereupon the princess also provided rations. The doc-trine of the Mahayana having thus blossomed in Tibet, for a period of twelve years"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"42 Conversion and Narrativeboth the samgha and ordinary layfolk practiced the doctrine and so were exceedinglyhappy. But even there Mara's host became agitated, and Mara sent forth the black poxand many other sorts of disease. As for the princess, she died after the black pox ap-peared at her heart. After that, the laity lost faith and said that the occurrence of theblack pox and many sorts of disease was an evil due to the arrival in Tibet of the hostof the samgha. It was ordained that not even one member of the samgha be permittedto remain in Tibet. After they were banished, one and all, the entire samgha traveledto Gandhara in India.27Other versions specify that the plague, which was almost certainly an Inner Asianoutbreak of what European medievalists now term the Justinian Plague, afflicted thechildren of the nobility in particular, and that the expulsion of the samgha was at theurging of the ministers close to the royal family.28It seems possible, then, that the Testament ofBa reflects a distant memory ofthe plague that occurred in Tibet in 739 and that claimed the life of the JinchengGongzhu, or of a subsequent outbreak during the years immediately following.Assuming this to have been the case, then the sudden loss of the children of thefamily, even if not representing literally a particular tragedy in the history of theBa clan, nevertheless may well reflect a disaster that afflicted many Tibetans ofhigh standing at that time. Indeed, the Old Tibetan Annals from Dunhuang recordsthe death of a royal prince, perhaps the crown prince, whom the Testament ofBaconsiders to have been slain by sorcery, together with the decease of the princessof Jincheng.29 What seems most certain is that, beginning no later than 739 andcontinuing no doubt for some years thereafter, some of the leading Tibetan clanswere stricken with an epidemiological catastrophe that defied their comprehension,and, like Ba Selnang according to the account of the Testament ofBa, under suchcircumstances, some would have no doubt experienced a crisis of faith, given es-pecially an environment in which alternative religious systems were already com-peting with one another. As the European experience of the Black Death duringthe fourteenth century teaches us, plague can act as a powerful catalyst for spiri-tual ferment.30Cosmology, Karma, and ConversionThat there was considerable spiritual ferment in Tibet during the eighth century issomething about which we can be certain: the evidence of this is abundant. Inter-preting that evidence, however, is another matter altogether. As was suggested ear-lier, one of the main difficulties we confront here is the authority of later Tibetanhistoriography, which offers us a much mythologized construction of eighth-centuryevents. In attempting to discern what relationship the tale of the vermilion-markedpearl might have to what we can plausibly argue to have been the case during theperiod it describes, above and beyond its probable reference to the Justinian Plague,let us survey in brief the thematic role of the episode under consideration in the nar-rative of the Testament ofBa itself, and the nature of the relationship between thethemes in question and what may be gleaned from authentic late eighth- and earlyninth-century sources."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Mark of Vermilion 43(1) The narrative of the Testament ofBa is developed episodically without any divi-sion of the work into chapters or marked sections, but we may nevertheless speak ofit as a composition in three movements. The first, to which the tale of the vermilion-marked pearl belongs, concerns the events surrounding the birth and childhood ofTrhi Songdetsen, culminating in his personal adoption of Buddhism.31 Here the Tes-tament ofBa places great emphasis, as we have seen in chapter 2, on funerary ritesand the truth of the Buddhist teaching regarding the round of rebirth, samsara. Notsurprisingly, it also has much to say about the propagation of the teaching of karma,the principle that fitting results ultimately issue from the moral quality of willful action.According to the narrative of the Testament ofBa, it is in fact Trhi Songdetsen's earlychildhood interest in and later adult acceptance of this teaching that signal a religiousorientation culminating in the monarch's conversion.32 The second broad division ofthe Testament ofBa recounts the invitations extended to the Indian masters Santaraksitaand Padmasambhava, their activities in Tibet, and the foundation of the Samye mon-astery, including the inception of the Tibetan Buddhist samgha.33 The final move-ment relates the great schism between adherents of the Chan propounded by theHeshang Moheyan and the followers of the gradual path of Indian Mahayana, andthe royal resolution of the conflict in favor of the Indian faction.34 The unifying warpthat runs through this narrative fabric emphasizes, I believe, the contested appropria-tion by the Tibetan court of the Indian cosmological framework that Buddhism re-quired as its proper context, that is to say, the conception of the world as a well-or-dered domain of rebirth governed by the lawlike operation of karma. This is clearand explicit in the first movement of the Testament ofBa, to which our tale belongs,but note, too, as the Testament ofBa itself underscores, that the Samye monastery isin its design a cosmogram, a three-dimensional model of the Mount Meru worldsystem through which beings revolve, and of the compresent mandala of the buddhaVairocana, which is the same world in its \"pure\" or awakened aspect.35 Finally, inthe doctrinal battle between the Heshang Moheyan and Kamalaslla, it is the appar-ently antinomian character of the former's teaching that stands condemned; that isto say, the radical Chan of the Heshang is presented as undermining precisely theorder of things that had been constructed in the preceding movements.36We may remark, too, that the structure of the Testament ofBa seems to recapitu-late—whether intentionally or not is uncertain—the pattern of traditional Tibetanmonastic debate, according to which one first refutes (dgag) the incorrect positionof one's opponent, which in this case is that of the Tibetan ministers who opposedthe Buddhist teaching of karma and rebirth; then establishes (gzhag) the correct viewheld by one's own party, here represented by the cosmogram of Samye; and finallyrefutes (spang) objections to and misapprehensions of one's position, as Kamalaslladoes in rebuking the Heshang.37 The tale of the vermilion-marked pearl, whateverits original inspiration, thus must be read as integral to the Testament ofBa's centralargument.While this much seems generally correct, there is a very important objection tothis interpretation of the text that must be addressed. As Blondeau has rightly argued,neither the tale that we find in the Testament ofBa, nor the rituals that Tibetans ac-tually practice in connection with neonatal deaths, really has anything to do withkarma. Rather, it seems to be the case that preexisting Tibetan religious beliefs hadalready assumed that persons may be reborn, at least under some conditions, and that"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"44 Conversion and Narrativethis, even prior to Buddhist doctrinal influences, explains in part the great impor-tance that notions of rebirth and reincarnation would later assume in Tibetan soci-ety.38 The Buddhist polemic, therefore, was concerned to demonstrate less the merefact that rebirth occurs, than that rebirth is a universal phenomenon that itself demon-strates the truth of the entire karma-samsara cosmology, and hence the superiority ofBuddhism as a soteriological system.39 The Testament ofBa simply seems to ignorethe inconvenient fact that the episode under discussion by itself really does not con-tribute to the case it is advanced to support. We shall return to this problem, for itwill emerge that later writers would indeed seek to modify the episode accordingly.For the moment, however, let us continue to examine the background for what I havetermed the Testament ofBa's central argument.(2) From the perspective of normative Buddhist doctrine, cosmology is thoughtof above all in terms of moral causation, involving, in traditional terms, the crucialteaching of rebirth. It is of some importance, then, that, beginning perhaps in the lasthalf of the eighth century—that is, still during the reign of Trhi Songdetsen—we startto find evidence of the production of an indigenous Tibetan didactic literature whoseprimary aim is the propagation of the doctrines of rebirth and moral causation. Asexamples, we may mention once more The History of the Cycle of Birth and Deathand add the Thrul-gyi byig-shu miphyi-ma-la bstan-pa'i mdo (The Sutra Taught bythe Monk of Magical Sagacity for Future Persons), a work of which there are alsomultiple copies or fragments in the Dunhuang collections.40 This short text in verse,treating the essential Buddhist themes of impermanence, rebirth, and karma, presagesin some respects the popular post-eleventh-century sermonizing concerning whatcame to be known in short as \"the four reversals of attitude\" (blo-ldog rnam-bzhi).41Noteworthy, too, is the Dunhuang collection of brief Buddhist funerary texts that wehave examined in chapter 1 (pp. 7-8), which anticipates the later literature on theintermediate state (bar-do) and includes a remarkable polemical passage pointedlycriticizing the pre-Buddhist funeral rites of Tibet as sacrifices incapable of securingthe ends for which they were intended.42 Steinkellner has edited, from among themanuscripts collected by Aurel Stein, the highly interesting 'Jig-rten pha-rol sgrub-pa (The Proof of a World Beyond) by one Prajnasena, a work that, though clearlyinspired by Indian philosophical models, was no doubt intended, in the form in whichit was preserved, for Tibetan consumption.43 The late eighth- and early ninth-cen-tury ascent of the cosmology of karma and rebirth seems also evident in the numer-ous liturgical texts discovered at Dunhuang, which make it clear that one of the keyroles for which the monks received official patronage was to perform confessionalservices for whatever evils were committed by the Tsenpo and his ministers, and tomagnify their merits, for, assuredly, in the business of running the empire, sin andmerit were to be gathered aplenty.44The Old Tibetan Chronicle from Dunhuang states that Trhi Songdetsen sought\"to propagate the dharma by constructing temples throughout the center and the fron-tiers, having made it accepted that the Buddha's dharma is unsurpassed. Guiding allthrough compassion, he freed them from birth-and-death, and secured them in per-petual deliverance.\"45 That the emperor was much impressed with Buddhism for themanner in which it described the world as a well-ordered and intelligible system ofmoral causation and rebirth finds confirmation in the small number of available docu-"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Mark of Vermilion 45ments that may be attributed with relative security to the monarch's command, andperhaps to his pen. Foremost are the edicts concerning the royal conversion to Bud-dhism, which, in the form in which they are preserved by Pawo Tsuklaktrhenga(1504-1566), have been generally thought to be authentic.46 It seems probable, too,that the author of the Testament ofBa was familiar with the text of these same edicts.47Though some details of their interpretation are open to question, the main points areclear: following the death of Trhi Detsuktsen in 755/756, Buddhism was suppressedby a ministerial conspiracy. When his son, Trhi Songdetsen, reached his twentiethyear, that is, in 761/762, various evil omens arose that could not be controlled by theestablished rituals, whereupon the ban on Buddhist worship was lifted and thingschanged for the good. The emperor then took up the study of the doctrine and cameto conclude that it did not accord with the old religion of Tibet in its cults and ritual(sku lha gsol ba dang cho ga myi mthunpas), and so it was suspected (dogs) of lead-ing the Tibetans to an evil fate, bringing epidemic and famine upon them (p. 53).By contrast, the Tsenpo continues, the Buddha has taught:Investigating the reality of the doctrine—for what is known from the doctrineis not found in the realms of the worldly—the states of sentient beings are be-yond number. All those born in the four ways and subject to rebirth are as theyare, beginninglessly and endlessly, owing to their own deeds (las, karman).48Following this is a brief disquisition on the three types of deeds, the six realms ofrebirth, and the merit and wisdom accumulated by the Buddhas, bodhisattvas, andarhats who transcend the world.49Trhi Songdetsen's favorable inclination to essentially scholastic Buddhism is fur-ther in evidence in the most extensive written work plausibly attributed to him, theBka' yang-dag-pa'i tshad-ma (The Authentic Proof of the Scriptures).50 Because thisdifficult treatise, which has been little studied as yet, is listed as his composition in acatalogue of Buddhist texts that was compiled at the order of his second son and grand-successor within two decades of his passing,51 we must, I think, accept that, if notcomposed literally by the emperor, it was at least ghostwritten for him with his knowl-edge and approval. What is most remarkable about it in connection with our presentsubject matter is its sustained concern with Buddhist discussions of reasoning and ofcausation. Like a convert to the Galilean system eagerly embracing the newly pro-pounded intelligibility of the heavens, the author of the Authentic Proof of the Scrip-tures delights in the very idea of reason (here: Tib. rigs-pa - Skt. yukti) that he findsarticulated in Buddhist scriptures:To express particular reasons is to exercise power with respect to all phenom-ena; for just as in the world whatever it is that kings uphold according to theirown reason is then implemented by the force of command, so, in the same way,adherence to one's own party, with respect to any principle, is established bythe authority of the reasons to which one holds.52It seems entirely consistent with what we otherwise know that a Buddhist mission-ary of the philosophical stature of £antaraksita would have appealed to his royalpatron by accentuating the analogy of the legislative role of reason, as understood inIndian Buddhist scholastic circles, with that of the monarch himself.53 Prominentamong the determinations of that reason is the reasonableness of the karma-samsaracosmology:"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"46 Conversion and NarrativeTo determine, he writes, that ordinary beings, proceed to another world whentheir lifeforce is exhausted ... [you must know that] it is the formless compo-nent, consciousness, that so proceeds. For instance, the wind, though lackingostensible form, moves about, carrying with it whatever odor it chances to meet,be it the fragrance of flowers or the stench of corruption, which one comes tosmell without perceiving any form of wind or of scent. Nevertheless, so long asthe continuum of the wind is uninterrupted, one smells the sweet or foul odorsrespectively, each without change. Similarly, though neither consciousness norkarma possesses form, it is apparent that ripening must accord with [that causewhich is subject to] maturation. Moreover, owing to whatever karma was com-mitted, which is the cause, one is born in the life beyond in a certain form, justas there is correspondence between the form that appears in a mirror and theform the mirror faces, or between a seal and the impression it makes in clay.54Of course, compared with later Tibetan scholasticism, this is perhaps not very ele-gant. What is of interest to us is not so much the degree of the monarch's philo-sophical perspicacity as the great fascination evidenced here with an apparentlynewfound ability to describe the world, however imperfectly, as an ordered processwhose complexity is nevertheless intelligible. And, unless we find some basis fordoubting the attribution of the Authentic Proof of the Scriptures at least to the courtof Trhi Songdetsen, we must accept its testimony, particularly given what we other-wise know of the symbolism of Samye, that Buddhist conceptions of cosmologicaland causal order indeed did play a significant role in the Tsenpo's decision to adoptthe foreign religion.In sum, then, there is a compelling body of evidence dating to the period underdiscussion that supports the conclusion that conceptions of rebirth and retribution,that is to say, the samsara-karma cosmological scheme and all that it entailed in ref-erence to notions of natural causation and human conduct, were both contested amongeighth-century Tibetans and aggresively propagated by the proponents of Buddhism,with the Tsenpo first and foremost among them. The Testament ofBa, though muchfictionalized, on this account may well preserve a genuine reflection of the climateof Tibetan thought during the age of the royal conversion to Buddhism.From Rebirth to ResurrectionThe later Tibetan historical tradition was produced almost entirely by authors forwhom the samsara-karma cosmology was beyond any possibility of serious contes-tation, so it is not surprising that they did not find a satisfying leitmotif in the Testa-ment of Ba's emphasis upon its verification in the face of denial.55 With theirre-visioning of the history of the Buddhist conquest of Tibet, the tale of the vermilion-marked pearl is for the most part forgotten. Puton alludes to it briefly, but withoutrecounting it in full.56 Pawo Tsuklaktrhenga, writing in the mid-sixteenth century,repeats it at length, but that is only because he reproduces whole sections of the Tes-tament ofBa verbatim in his work.57 A century later, the Fifth Dalai Lama, critical ofPawo's use of the Testament ofBa, a work that he finds at once fascinating and sus-pect, mentions our tale, but because he regards it as indicative of the Testament ofBa's inconsistencies: if the Buddhist clergy had been expelled from Tibet following"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Mark of Vermilion 47a ban on their religion, he asks, what was the old Chinese monk still doing in Lhasa?For this and other reasons, he concludes that, though the Testament ofBa may wellbe genuinely ancient in its origins, it has been much contaminated in the course of itstransmission by its later editors.58The vermilion-marked pearl, though buried once more, was by no means entirelylost, however, even disregarding the brief disinternments just mentioned. Its pecu-liar recovery, to which we now turn, clearly indicates a stunning transformation inthe Tibetan conception of Tibet's imperial past. We may even say that, like BaSelnang's poor daughter, her story was itself marvelously reborn.I have argued that, during the period in which Buddhism was adopted as the domi-nant religion of the old Tibetan state, it was the world-ordering dimension of Bud-dhist teaching that was of greatest interest to the emperors and that defined the pat-tern of their adherence to and patronage of their new religion. Soteriological Buddhismwas, officially at least, primarily a matter for the monks, whose pursuit of perfectenlightenment helped to ensure that the samgha was a worthy object for the generos-ity of noble patrons anxious to earn merit and repent of misdeeds. This is not to saythat there were no soteriological orientations in evidence outside of officially spon-sored monastic institutions: the fashion of Chan in the late-eighth-century court cer-tainly involved nonmonastic practitioners from the royal family and nobility,59 andmany of the Dunhuang fragments of Tibetan esoteric texts seem likely to have ema-nated from outside of the state-sanctioned monastic mainstream.60 Nevertheless, itis clear that, adopting Spire's categories, \"kammatic\" and not \"nibbanic\" Buddhismwas in the forefront of official Tibetan religious interest during the eighth and ninthcenturies.61 By the eleventh century, however, much had changed. The old empirehad long since collapsed and there simply was no central source of political author-ity in the Tibetan world.62 The Buddhist karma-samsara cosmology had increasinglybecome normative for Tibetans, so that, while it was still actively propagated, as itwould be down to the present day, its propagation was no longer a matter of activecontestation, as the author of the Testament ofBa considers it to have been, and asseveral of the Dunhuang manuscripts mentioned here confirm that indeed it was. Atthe same time, the broadening dissemination of esoteric doctrine and practice effecteda reorientation in which soteriological Buddhism became a matter of immediate con-cern for Tibetan Buddhists more generally, while at the same time those who werethought to be guardians of esoteric salvific teaching became esteemed in both tem-poral and religious spheres, so that the lama (bla-ma) now increasingly emerged asthe common locus of actual power, worldly and spiritual.63With this in mind, then, we turn to a story that comes into wide circulation in theearly fourteenth century. This is the account of the origins of an esoteric teaching ofthe Nyingmapa school of Tibetan Buddhism, a teaching of the Great Perfection(rdzogs-chen) system of meditation, called the Mkha'- 'gro snying-thig (The Inner-most Spirituality of the Dakinl).64 The textual sources of this teaching are prominentamong the \"treasures,\" or revealed doctrines, that began to proliferate from aboutthe twelfth century on,65 these in particular having been revealed by the enigmaticPema Lendreltsel, who flourished in Central Tibet towards the turn of the thirteenthto the fourteenth century. The corpus he \"discovered\" was given its definitive re-daction and then widely popularized in the mid-fourteenth century by LongchenRabjampa (1308-1363), the greatest scholastic master of the Nyingmapa school."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"48 Conversion and NarrativeAccording to the tale that is narrated there, the monarch Trhi Songdetsen had adaughter, called Princess Pemasel, who died when she was just eight. The ruler,becoming utterly distraught, at once sends for his guru, the Indian tantric masterPadmasambhava, who explains at length the nature of the king's karmic connectionwith the daughter who is at once so well loved, and through her death has caused themonarch so much grief. The master then inscribes the mantra syllable NR in vermil-ion at the little girl's heart-center. Recalling her consciousness from the intermedi-ate state by means of his Gnostic abilities, he coerces her to reanimate her corpse.After she reawakens, he transmits the liberating teaching of the Innermost Spiritual-ity of the Dakim to her, and it is through her later rebirths as Pema Lendreltsel and asLongchen Rabjampa himself that this teaching is made available for the general edi-fication of the faithful.66Now, I think it is clear that we are in essence dealing with one and the same storyhere and in the Testament ofBa's tale of the vermilion-marked pearl. The structuralconnections between the two are unmistakeable, and the transformations of the taleboth intriguing and illuminating. Consider:(1) Ba Selnang  -> Trhi Songdetsen(2) Ba's daughter  —> Princess Pemasel(3) Chinese Heshang  —> Padmasambhava(4) vermilion-marked pearl  —> vermilion mantra-syllable(5) rebirth   —> resurrection(6) vindication of rebirth  —> vindication of Great Perfection(a cosmological doctrine)  (a soteriological doctrine)Moreover, the story of Princess Pemasel, by making fully explicit the karmic back-ground of the episode, responds precisely to the objection that, as we have seen, maybe raised against the Buddhist credentials of the account given in the TestamentofBa.Of course, it is possible that the author of the Innermost Spirituality of the Dakimdid not in fact know the Testament ofBa's account, and that his version of the storywas independently composed on the basis of the same ritual to which that accountrefers. This, however, in no way alters my basic thesis: in either case, we are dealingwith essentially similar material, reflecting in its origins indigenous Tibetan beliefsand practices, as appropriated by self-consciously Buddhist authors writing of themin different periods in markedly differing ways. The variations of this simple tale,therefore, aptly illustrate the manner in which the royal conversion to Buddhism asthe imperial religion during the eighth and ninth centuries became thoroughlyreformulated by later Tibetan chroniclers so as to accord, in significant respectsanachronistically, with the needs and interests of their own day.From the eleventh century onward, the Tibetan vision of the old order becameincreasingly defined by the ongoing elaboration of two great cycles of myths ofimperial Tibet: an Avalokitesvara cycle, focusing primarily on the reign of SongtsenGampo, and a Padmasambhava cycle, concerning the reign of Trhi Songdetsen.(These will be examined in chapter 8.) Throughout the latter, it is the apotheosis ofPadmasambhava, now the \"precious guru\" of the Tibetan people as a whole, whodominates even the figure of the Tsenpo.67 It is his teaching of esoteric means toachieve swift liberation mat becomes doctrinally preeminent.

In the narratives of the foundation of Samye, too, the old ministerial clansare either forgotten altogether or receive a poor second billing after the legendaryadepts of Padmasambhava's immediate circle.69 Thus even the Testament ofBa, awork that seems to have nothing but praise for the great master, ultimately comes tobe disparaged by later adherents of his cult, not for its inconsistencies, but because it isthought to represent the \"sullied perspective\" of the ministers.70 The transformationsnoted here in the tale of the mark of vermilion thus may serve to delineate a generaland thoroughgoing transformation of Tibetan historical consciousness.Our tale, however, was still subject to one more rebirth. In the most famous of theaccounts of Padmasambhava, the epic Padma bka'-thang (The Testimonial Recordof Padmasambhava) revealed by Orgyen Lingpa (fl. mid-fourteenth cent.), the storyof Princess Pemasel is told once more, mostly following the version we have justsummarized, but in the Testimonial Record of Padmasambhava there is no mark ofvermilion, no resurrection, no transmission to her of the liberating teaching of theGreat Perfection.71 Rather, in what remains of the Innermost Spirituality''s lengthynarrative, Padmasambhava, the omniscient master who knows past, present, and"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"50 Conversion and NarrativeFigure 3.2 Mi-tshe-ring, the \"long-life man,\" derived from the Chinese god oflongevity Shouxing, is a buffoon figure in monastic dance-dramas.

In concluding part 1, let us turn now to the conversion itself, adher-ing so far as is possible to evidence derived from texts and artifacts that, for the mostpart, assuredly do stem from the period concerned.1 On the basis of this material, Ishall attempt to sketch out here, not so much a history of events, but rather a specu-lative reconstruction of the intentions that the early Tibetan adoption of Buddhisminvolved.The conversion of Trhi Songdetsen and its ramifications for the Tibetan empirehave been much discussed by contemporary Tibetanists. Those investigating theearliest available sources have succeeded in recent decades in bringing a substantialbody of relevant material to light that not so long ago had either seemed altogetherincapable of adequate decipherment or was otherwise buried in obscurity.2 Never-theless, despite the materials that are now at our disposal, prejudgements aboutTibetan history, whether stemming from an earlier phase in our knowledge of Tibetor from popular misrepresentations, remain in wide circulation.A prominent aspect of the Western myth of Tibet is that the Tibetans were a na-tion of semibarbarous warriors who were civilized and thus tamed by the gentle teach-ings of Buddhism.3 Whatever partial truths may have contributed to this myth, theactual historical record makes perfectly clear that it would be an absurdity to describethe conversion of the empire in any such terms: after all, Trhi Songdetsen's armiessacked the Chinese capital in 763, that is, within two years of his adoption of thereligion of peace.

That he at least saw no con-4"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"52 Conversion and Narrativetradiction here is clearly indicated by the introduction to his commission of a lexicalguide to Buddhist scriptural translations, which tells us:In the horse year the Emperor Trhi Desongtsen dwelt in the Oncangdo palace in Kyi.The old armies of east and west had been rotated and the brigands quelled. Themessenger(s) of the Karluk offered homage. The Great Ministers . . . and othersbrought much tribute from the territories, and offered camels, horses and cattle toHis Majesty. As a follow-up to the awards that he granted to each according to rankfrom Zhanglon on down, he gave his command that... those who had become mas-ter translators ... should write a catalogue of the Tibetan translations and coinagesderiving from the Sanskrit of the Greater and Lesser Vehicles.5The assumption that Buddhism and imperium might be incompatible is one that wouldnot have occurred to these Buddhists, and, indeed, it is one that few serious studentsof Buddhist history would countenance today.6Nevertheless, there is a more subtle version of this view that does, I think, con-tinue to lurk in the background of the study of early Tibet. The argument runs some-thing like this: Tibet rose to imperial greatness, ruling much of Inner Asia and suc-cessfully challenging even such potent adversaries as the Arabs and the Chinese,largely on the strength of its indigenous resources and traditions. (This premise seemsin essence true.) Within a few generations of the conversion to Buddhism, however,the empire grew weak, and, riven by factional feuds among the nobles, it collapsed.(True as well.) Evidently, the later monarchs' religious concerns led them to diverttoo much in the way of resources to the monks and monasteries, and to devote toolittle to the maintenance of Tibet's earlier strengths.7 This conclusion, however, is anon sequitur.Available evidence does not permit a neat and clear clarification of all the issuesraised here, but certainly several elements of the argument are suspect. Factionalfeuding of the nobility, for instance, is known to have preceded and accompaniedthe rise of the empire, and so it was by no means uniquely tied to the presence ofBuddhism.8 It is more likely the case that religious faction was above all the result,and not the cause, of deeper divisions among Tibet's lords. That is to say, religionbecame a means for the representation of political difference. We do not yet havesufficient knowledge of the imperial economy to determine to what extent patron-age of Buddhism may have drained the exchequer. But at the same time, it is clearthat the Tibetan armies at the frontiers were massively dependent upon corvee labor,the forced impression of conquered peoples into military service, and the expropria-tion of animals, goods, and commodities in the conquered territories, arrangementsthat were no doubt well suited to an empire still expanding into new territory, butprobably destabilizing once the pace of imperial expansion slowed.9 The primaryreason, in fact, to single out Buddhism as having had a special causal relation withthe decline of the empire is that the predominant Tibetan historical myth, in both itsBuddhist and Bonpo versions, does just that;10 but the myth accentuates the supposedrole of religious dispute precisely because it was composed by religious partisans,for whom religion was a uniquely compelling concern.11 In Tibet, as in religioussocieties elsewhere, such concern fundamentally shaped the manner in which his-tory came to be written, but it is less clear that the history we are now examining wasitself so shaped."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Plague, Power, and Reason 53It seems, then, preferable to leave the question of the relationship between Bud-dhism and the empire's decline to one side, until at least there is more advance in thestudy of some issues of certain relevance to this, such as the imperial economy, oldTibetan civil and military institutions, and the formation of the early aristocracy.12But by our raising these questions, the role of Buddhism under the Tibetan empire isitself problematized, and it is this that introduces the matter to be considered here: ifthe old traditions of Tibet were, as seems the case, entirely adequate to support theearly growth of the empire, and if the Buddhism adopted under the empire was, as Ihave suggested, in any case compatible with Tibet's martial culture,13 why did theemperors judge it to be desirable to adopt the foreign religion at all? What wasBuddhism's special appeal to them?The Power of PlagueWe have seen earlier that occurrences of plague and epidemics were among the cir-cumstances that the Testament ofBa recalled in connection with events leading up tothe emperor's conversion, and that the earliest sources offer some confirmation in thisregard. The emperor himself, in his later edict discussing the conversion, had said:That [Buddhism] was not the old religion. Because it did not accord with the propitia-tions and rites of the tutelary deities, all suspected it to be no good. They suspected itwould harm [me, His Majesty]. They suspected it would threaten governance. Theysuspected [that it brought about] epidemics and cattle plagues. They suspected it, whenfamine suddenly fell upon them.14It is characteristic of our modern sensibility to think that, for the most part, epidemicsand the like were outside the domain of human rational control until very recently.Many of us tend to harbor a perspective according to which—from the standpoint ofpublic health policy and similar matters—shamanic healing, Buddhist merit mak-ing, and contact with the relics of long deceased Catholic saints represent essentiallysimilar, quasi-magical efforts to manipulate one's environment in the absence of soundscientific knowledge. It is important for us to recall, therefore, that medieval peoplescertainly did not see things in this way. They, like ourselves, held that some beliefsand practices were sensible and others foolish. Destructive diseases were, as theyindeed still are, particularly terrifying deformations of human existence, and the belief,true or false, that we have won or are in the process of winning some degree of ap-parently rational mastery over them counts for a great deal among us. And, gener-ally speaking, this was true, too, of medieval peoples.I emphasize these simple points because we too often tacitly accept the modernreligionists' dichotomy of sacred and profane spheres and read it back into the worldsof our forebears. If we wish to make sense of the preferability of Buddhism to somein medieval Tibet, we need to understand how they thought it rationalized, moreadequately than jts competitors, the frailties of our concrete existence in the world.The adoption of the cosmology of karma and samsara, as we have seen in the pre-ceding chapter, did not preclude, and in some respects no doubt encouraged, theperformance of what we might hold to be magical ritual;15 but also it did appear tomake intelligible why it was that among such rituals there were sometimes those that"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"54 Conversion and Narrativeworked and other times those that failed; and did so in a lawlike manner. Furthermore—and this should be borne in mind in connection with all that will follow—the cosmol-ogy of karma and samsara comported well with an imperial interest in legislation; thatis to say, law and order may be reinforced by assenting to cosmic justice and order.16We may note parenthetically that, despite the emperor's concern to allay fearsregarding the cults of the Tibetan protective divinities and his insistence on the ex-planatory soundness of karma, this conflict is one that in fact has never been fullyresolved for the Tibetans, even in our own times. In an address to the Tibetan com-munity as recently as 1996, the present Dalai Lama criticized those who, he said,place too much faith in the supposed agency of divine protectors and attend too littleto the management of their own karma.n I do not think that he had Trhi Songdetsen' sedict in mind; the resemblance of the arguments is coincidental, and for that reasonall the more striking.18The Charisma of ReasonWeberian reflections on religion sometimes underscore a broad distinction betweenspontaneous, charismatic sources of authority, and rational, institutional ones, andin this connection emphasize the conception of a routinization of charisma.19 Withthe establishment, for instance, of a trained priesthood or church, the uncanninessof charisma becomes contained and controlled. But this is not to say that it islost. It is important that we consider in this regard the possibilities afforded for acharismaticization of reason. Imperial Buddhism in medieval Tibet may be taken,I think, as a case in point.The early Tibetan kings were certainly regarded as divine in their origin, and, aswe have seen in chapter 1, much of what we know of pre-Buddhist Tibetan cult re-lates to the cult of the kings.20 Tsenpo (btsan-po), the proper designation by whichthe Tibetan monarch was known, a term relating to secure power and strength,21 mayalso relate the ruler to the tsen (btsan), a class of divinities often associated withmountains, high ground, and cliffs, who in contemporary Tibetan religion are com-monly regarded as demonic temple protectors.22 The title was first adopted, it seems,by the rulers of Yarlung and came to refer uniquely to the Tibetan emperor, rather inthe manner that \"tsar\" did to the ruler of the Russian empire.23 Chinese chroniclerswere content to write the phonetic approximation, zanpti, in Chinese characters, andnot to attempt a translation.24 We must bear in mind, then, that the Tibetan emperorthus enjoyed a unique sacral-political status.25Later Tibetan historiography attributes three great civilizing innovations to theseventh-century ruler Songtsen Gampo (c. 617-649), whose conquests are usuallyseen as defining the beginnings of the Tibetan empire: the introduction of a systemof writing, the codification of the laws, and the inception of Tibetan Buddhism.26These themes have been much mythologized in the writings of post-eleventh-centuryhistorians, and their accounts can be used only with great caution. Nevertheless, theirassociation of literacy, legislation, and religious change probably does represent agenuine insight into the structural relationships among these three undeniably cru-cial turns in the cultural history of early medieval Tibet. The burgeoning dimensionsof the Tsenpo's realm, and the attendant increase in the complexity of its civil and"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Plague, Power, and Reason 55military administration, and of its relations with its neighbors, most certainly requiredclose attention to the regularization of the practices and policies of the state at manylevels. Under such circumstances, writing and recordkeeping became indispensabletechnologies. The earliest statement of what took place when the empire was bornduring the early seventh century, as recorded some two centuries later in the OldTibetan Chronicle from Dunhuang, reflects such concerns:Formerly, Tibet had no writing, but during the lifetime of this emperor the Great Leg-islation that was the Sacred Authority of Tibet (bod-kyi gtsug-lag bka'-grims chad-mo),21 as well as the rank-order of ministers, the powers of both great and small, theawards in recognition of excellence, the punishments for misdeeds, the regularization,among farmers and herdsmen, of pelts, acreage and roadways, the measures of vol-ume and weight, etc.—all of the righteous governance of Tibet emerged during thetime of the emperor Trhi Songtsen. Because everyone recalled and experienced hisbeneficence, they called him by the name of \"Songtsen the Wise\" [Songtsen Gampo].28We may be inclined to assume that the ancient institutions of Tibetan sacral kingshipprovided a fully adequate ideological basis for the Tibetan empire. An early andimportant passage such as this one indeed supports that view, as it contains no sug-gestion that the royal innovations were founded upon anything besides more ancientTibetan customs and institutions. This reading, however, may be in certain respectsnaive. For the process whereby the principality of Yarlung grew to become the king-dom of Tibet, continued to expand to include territories and peoples beyond the con-fines of the Tibetan world, and in so doing required and created a literate imperialadministration is scarcely conceivable without being accompanied by significantideological transformations. The advent of literacy and literate practices were thusconsequences of and conditions for great changes in many aspects of the culture ofTibet. Our problem is to understand the nature of such changes in relation to thecontinuities with the past that seem also to be emphasized in our sources.Literacy contributed to the emergence of and empowerment of new classes whosemakeup is not yet well understood.29 Certainly, those members of the older domi-nant classes who became literate—or at least came to depend upon the services ofliterate persons they employed—were included among them, and we must also sup-pose there to have been scribes, clerks, supply and taxation officers, et cetera, whosecorporate identity was newly engendered above all by their employment in the cre-ation and maintenance of written records. Even assuming, as likely was the case, thatmany such persons would have been of menial status, their literate labor became acondition for the power of those whom they served.30 The written word, in short,was a new and powerful technology in the Tibetan world that could not readily bereduced to or subsumed within the sacral, economic, or martial powers that alonehad dominated Tibet until the time of Songtsen Gampo.The archaic, preliterate ideology of Tibetan sacral kingship, centered upon thelocal cults of the Yarlung valley and its environs, could not have remained perfectlystable for long. The internal constitution and foreign relations of the newly literateempire both increasingly favored writing as a vehicle for the organization not onlyof established knowledge but also of diplomacy, intelligence, and the assimilationand diffusion of new knowledge within a heterogeneously composed, literate com-munity. Great skill in the techniques of the written word came to be imbued with a"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"56 Conversion and Narrativepeculiar charisma of its own, and it would have been natural to attribute this powerto neighboring civilizations whose longer histories of literacy gave them relativelygreater advancement here, and who thus offered models for Tibetan emulation.31 TheChinese chancellery and the Buddhist monastery were certainly not the sole exem-plars of mastery over the arts of writing available to Tibetans of the seventh and eighthcenturies, but they would have been among the most impressive. That foreign cul-tural influences, and Buddhist and Chinese influences above all, should have becomeimportant forces in Tibet in the wake of the creation of the Tibetan script was thusentailed in some measure by the circumstances attending the growth of the empireitself.32 Tibet could have maintained its archaic traditions wholly unchanged onlyby retreating into itself, foregoing the path of imperial expansion.It is in part owing to the vagaries of later history that in one area alone the evi-dence bearing on the organization of knowledge in early medieval Tibet is far bet-ter preserved than in any other and is extremely impressive. I refer, of course, tothe transmission and codification of Buddhist learning during the late eighth andearly ninth centuries. For it was here, given the position of Buddhism as the domi-nant ideology throughout postimperial Tibetan history and the aura of sacrality thatcame to surround the Buddhism of the imperial period in particular, that the latertradition preserved in relative abundance documents of fundamental importance.33From our own distant vantage point, the reason that the achievement of the empire'sBuddhists in the redaction of scriptural learning appears to overwhelm other accom-plishments of Tibetan learning thus may be the result of the fortuitous conjunctionof superior preservation during a later period with religious charisma acquired afterthe fact. Despite this, there can be little doubt that the very great efforts made to estab-lish Buddhism and Buddhist learning in the Tibetan empire do reflect in part the valueattributed to them by Tibet's rulers during the eighth and ninth centuries: monastic,clerical Buddhism, with its trained scholars and scribes, its language sciences andmethods of translation, its libraries and catalogues, its sytematicization of reasoningand debate, provided medieval Tibet with an ideal model of organized knowledge.34In a sprawling empire in which the management of knowledge must have been felt asan ever more urgent concern, part of the charisma attributed to Buddhism stemmedfrom its particular mastery over the arts of the written word, its mastery of reason.35Stephen Teiser has argued recently that the Chinese emperors who sponsored theproduction of Chinese Buddhist canonical collections did so because it was possibleto regard the canon, the Buddhist Scriptural Treasury, precisely as an imperial trea-sure. The royal possession of the Dharmakaya—the corpus of the Buddha's doctrine—became in effect a new source of royal charisma.36 Something similar seems to havetaken place in Tibet, but we may further specify that possession of the canon signi-fied the incorporation into the monarch's domain of the well-ordered empire of en-lightened reason.Buddhism and LegislationThe themes we are considering are clearly in evidence in connection with the devel-opment of the traditions and legends of Tibetan imperial legislation. We have seenearlier that the Old Tibetan Chronicle, which attributes the redaction of the laws to"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Plague, Power, and Reason 57Songtsen Gampo, says nothing at all that would lead us to see the influence of Bud-dhist ethics at work here. This impression is borne out by surviving fragments of theold laws, which are similarly devoid of references to Buddhism.37 Later Tibetan tra-dition, however, while retaining some records of the old laws, asserts them to havebeen built upon foundations derived from basic Buddhist morality and the traditionsof Indian Dharmasastra. This transformation is particularly intriguing, however, foras Stein has clearly shown, the incremental evolution of the traditions concerningthe imperial legislation can be traced in a number of early documents.38Crucial evidence of this process may be found in a manuscript in the India OfficeLibrary collection (IO 370), first studied by Richardson.39 This incomplete work foundat Dunhuang has the appearance of a school exercise; I have come to think of it as apoem on the rise of Buddhism in Tibet that was to be copied and memorized by youngstudents, perhaps in the early ninth century, though, I must emphasize, we cannotknow with any certainty that it was so intended or used. It shows that besides theassociation of Trhi Songdetsen with the promulgation of Buddhism in Tibet, which wewould expect in any case, Songtsen Gampo was already in some circles being thoughtof as a Buddhist monarch: the seeds of the later legend were no doubt already planted.Of special interest here is the depiction of Tibetan law as harmonized with Buddhistmoral principles, also anticipating the later traditions, which seek to find the basis forSongtsen Gampo's legislation in Indian and Buddhist law and morality (though in ourpresent text, the reference to the pillar inscriptions makes it likely that Trhi Songdetsenin fact is the legislator here referred to). The text reads in part:The lords of men, sons of the gods and supreme kings,The Magically Sagacious King SongtsenAnd the Monarch Trhi Songdetsen,In the realm of Tibet, a human land in Jambudvlpa,Well proclaimed the supreme greater vehicle,The doctrine of the transcendent perfection of discernment,The Mother of the Sugatas of the [three] times,That, like the Udumbara flower,Is an extremely fine and rare panacea,Benefiting all beings,And that, equipoised regarding suchness,Deconstructs the extremes of being and nonbeing;Thus they taught the teaching of Gautama, the Sakya.Accepting [that teaching], they made it their spiritual commitment,And greatly increased it among all beings.For there to be firm retention of it,It was written on a stone pillar as a compact between the lord and his subjects.In the ocean of such sacred scripture,The conduct of the lord and his subjects became the world-mountain.So doing, an enduring scriptural foundation was established:Those born within the realm, Tibet and Kham, were happy,Harvests were good, diseases of men and cattle rare,The authority and customs of the subjects, too, were great.Because divine doctrine and human custom were feared,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"58 Conversion and NarrativeThey were honored and closely adhered to, so thatTeachers, parents, relations, and friends,The elderly, and those of higher stationWere gently and respectfully honored in an unerring manner.Because they had a kindly attitude towards all,They neither stole from nor plundered one other.They avoided lying, sexual license, and shamefulness,And were straightforward, reliable, heroic, and greatly disciplined.Though human in body, their customs were divine.In other kingdoms, and among other men,This was unprecedented, and will not be again;Even among the gods this is rare.Because, when his father, the king, died, the son was young,The fine doctrine and old scriptures declined.But the supreme path of truth, the virtuous doctrine,The ten virtues of the discipline, were preserved,And the royal laws of the king, lord of men,Oral traditions taught by wise ancestors—Where else were these performed as in the customs of Tibet?40What we may clearly discern here is an effort on the part of Tibet's Buddhists todemonstrate the harmony that was supposed to have obtained between Buddhismand the laws and customs enacted by the Tibetan court. The demonstration of suchan affinity would no doubt have contributed to the rationalization of Buddhism'sposition within Tibet, that is, it could be seen as not an entirely alien tradition. Thisin turn paved the way for the development of the mythic readings of Tibetan impe-rial history we shall examine in chapter 8, in which the innate affinity between theBuddha's teaching and Tibet is given cosmological grounding even prior to the in-troduction of Buddhism.41 But in the present context, we must ask, how may Bud-dhism, in its aspects that emphasized the convergence of law and morality, have servedthe interests of the Tibetan empire?In essence, the answer is, I think, a simple one: a requirement of the state is a stateof sin. The moral teachings of Buddhism, as those of the other \"universal religions,\"serve as a source of legal and political coercion.42 So long as Tibet remained a rela-tively restricted domain whose subjects held a common family of sacred powers inreverence and were subservient to the direct power of their chieftain, there was noneed to seek a source of authority beyond what Tibetan tradition itself had to offer.The foundation of a universal state, however, ruling many diverse peoples and inactive contact with many more, necessitated a framework of universal law, whichBuddhism was able to supply. The legislative value of Buddhism was, in a sense,made evident by Tibet's expansion into the world.Imperial CosmopolitanismThe tremendous influence of Buddhism upon the later formation of Tibetan culturetends to obscure for us the role of many other cultural influences that also becameavailable to Tibetans as a result of Tibet's geographical expansion. The evidence"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Plague, Power, and Reason 59suggests that Nestorian Christianity, Manichaeism, Chinese historiography and divi-nation, and Greek medicine were to be counted among numerous foreign ways ofknowledge to which the Tibetans were exposed at this time. The establishment anddissemination of a more-or-less standard writing system, of course, greatly facili-tated the spread of such \"exotic\" learning within the Tibetan empire. It is of particu-lar interest, therefore, that among the texts preserved at Dunhuang we find transla-tions and summaries of literary works, histories, and other genres of writing concernedin one way or another with the foreign peoples with whom the Tibetans were now incontact.The Tibetan empire in Central Asia at various times included the regions of Khotan,the Tarim basin, Lop Nor, and other places with Iranian and Turkic populations.43The contribution of these peoples to the formation of the culture of the empire is lessclear than the contribution of China or India, though we can be sure that much of theIndian culture known to the Tibetans was in fact transmitted via Central Asia andKhotan.44 Khotanese artistic influence was sufficient so that, in addition to Chineseand Indian styles, Tibetan sources would speak of a distinctively Khotanese style, aswell.45 Sogdian textiles, renowned for their sophisticated manufacture and design,also made their way to Tibet.46 There is some evidence that Galenic medicine reachedTibet through Central Asian sources during this period, and this also points to theIranian world, perhaps through Sogdiana or Khotan.47 Khotanese literature in Tibetantranslation is represented in several works dealing with the history of Buddhism inKhotan.48 Tibetan interest in the neighboring peoples of Central Asia is further exem-plified by a fascinating document in the Pelliot collection in Paris (PT1283), a sort ofintelligence report summarizing knowledge of the Turkish population around Beshbaliq,among other sources of evidence.49 The old Tibetan versions of the Ramayana, too,demonstrate Tibet's participation in wider spheres of Asian culture.50I review these facts here because they point to an additional element of impor-tance in interpreting the Tibetan adoption of Buddhism. I have suggested earlier thatBuddhism interested the Tibetans in no small measure through its successful promo-tion of a particular, well-ordered, cosmological framework, which implied the ethi-cal and ritual mastery of the cosmos it promoted, and through its institutional mas-tery of techniques, which conformed with the bureaucratic requirements of empire.But Buddhism had another feature favoring it that the indigenous Tibetan royal cultdid not; Buddhists, so to say, spoke an international language. In fact, given the pe-culiar position of Tibet, Buddhism in the eighth century would have been the mostprominent cultural system known in almost all the surrounding nations; its presencein India and Nepal, China, and Central Asia may well have contributed to an aura ofuniversality.51 The Chinese princess of Jincheng, as we have seen in chapter 3, broughtto Tibet Khotanese Buddhist monks, who departed for Gandhara in what is todaynorthern Pakistan after their royal patron's demise. And in chapter 5, we shall turn tothe tenuous, but nevertheless real, transmission of Korean Buddhist materials toTibet at this time.The tale of the Jincheng Gongzhu, however, also made clear that the internationalspread of Buddhism was not at once appreciated in Tibet. Its significance in this re-spect could only be disclosed when the Tibetan monarchs began to adopt Buddhistsymbols and conventions for the exercise of royal authority, in other words, when itbegan to emerge that Buddhism facilitated the symbolic expression of imperial power"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"60Conversion and NarrativeFigure 4.1 Dunhuang cave 159.A Tibetan Tsenpo in the lowerregister of a mural depicting thebodhisattva Vimalaklrti as itsmain theme.

Textual, archeological, and art historical evidence alltend to support the conclusion that the emperor himself was in some sense homolo-gous with the cosmic Buddha, and that the ordering of the empire was therefore effec-tively equivalent to the generation of the mandala. This conclusion is indirectly rein-forced by the evidence of Indian-influenced imperial cults in other parts of Asia duringroughly the same period.531 wish to suggest that the Tibetan imperial state itself cameto be constituted, through a principle of homology, as the body and mandala of theBuddha Vairocana.We have seen that Buddhism, during its first century or so in Tibet, was subject toan oscillating fate, sometimes tolerated, occasionally banned, but not permitted tosupplant established Tibetan beliefs and practices. The sea change began in 761/762,when the young emperor Trhi Songdetsen adopted Buddhism as the religion of hiscourt. Following this, in the 770s he constructed the first full-fledged monastery inTibet in which Tibetan monks could receive ordination and extended state patron-age to support massive translation projects.54 The foundation, circa 779, of the Samyemonastic complex, with its great three-storey central temple, is remembered by Ti-betans as the central event in the conversion of their nation to the foreign religion.Unfortunately, we do not have precise contemporaneous evidence regarding the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Plague, Power, and Reason 61founding of Samye and its plan, but the Testament ofBa' s account of its architectureand design is remarkably detailed and probably in large part authentic.55 Accordingto this account—and here the later Tibetan histories and the plan of the later restora-tions of Samye all concur—Samye was designed in a manner that gave special promi-nence to Vairocana. It was Vairocana who was installed as the central divinity in thesecond storey, while the four-faced Sarvavid-Vairocana, surrounded by the eightforemost bodhisattvas and other deities, making up a mandala of forty-two, occupiedthe uppermost shrine. The central divinity on the lowest storey was Sakyamuni, who isin this context also the Nirmanakaya, the emanational embodiment, of Vairocana.56Of course, the plan of Samye included many other deities who do not seem to havebeen so closely related to the Vairocana traditions,57 but it is difficult to resist the im-pression that esoteric Buddhism was represented at Samye first and foremost byVairocana. As Richardson has shown, this orientation was recapitulated in severalother Central Tibetan temples of the late imperial and early postimperial period,58and, indeed, the association of Vairocana with royal cult appears to have endured inWest Tibet well into the second millenium.59It is furthermore important to recall in this connection that the Tibetan court ap-pears to have been very restrained in its commitment to the esoteric traditions of tantricBuddhism. The circulation of the tantras was restricted by order of the court, andpermission to translate and to transmit them strictly controlled.60 It is against thisbackground that the apparent prominence of Vairocana becomes particularly signifi-cant. In eighth- and ninth-century Tibet, the tantric free-for-all that comes to charac-terize aspects of Tibetan Buddhism during the eleventh century had not yet occurred,61so that the accentuation of particular esoteric traditions in the otherwise intention-ally limited field of imperial-period Buddhism gains considerable gravity.The likelihood that Trhi Songdetsen greatly favored the Vairocana traditions isunderscored by more than just the reports of Samye's design. There is, as we haveseen (p. 45), one important doctrinal text attributed to the monarch himself, and, al-though it may certainly have been written by others on his behalf, it is doubtlesslya product of his court and was published under royal authority. Its opening versesof invocation, in the present context, are especially suggestive, given the traditionthat the upper storeys of Samye housed the mandala of Vairocana with the eight fore-most bodhisattvas and other deities, while the ground floor emphasized Sakyamuni,possibly as the emanational embodiment (nirmanakaya) of Vairocana. In the invoca-tions at the beginning of the Authentic Proof of the Scriptures, we find Sakyamuni oncemore, accompanied by the eight bodhisattvas and by the wrathful deities Trailokyavijayaand Acala. Both of these last-mentioned deities are exclusively associated with Bud-dhist tantric materials, and, what is more, they appear elsewhere in strong connec-tion with the Vairocana cult, notably in the Japanese Shingon tradition, where asGosanze-myoo and Fudo-myoo they are foremost among the fierce Knowledge-Kings(vidydrajd) protecting the mandala.62 The basis for this association is possibly theMahavairocanabhisambodhi (The Awakening of the Great Vairocana), where they(and the eight bodhisattvas) are among the deities emphasized.63 And it will be seenas we proceed that this tantra was central to the officially sanctioned esoteric Bud-dhism of the Tibetan empire.The importance of the invocation verses, therefore, is found in the reinforcementthat it offers to the thesis that, despite his great caution regarding the way of mantra,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"62 Conversion and NarrativeTrhi Songdetsen did sanction some tantric traditions that were well established in amonastic context, and that had become widely associated with royal cult.64 Thetantrism sanctioned by the Tibetan emperor may have to some extent resembled thatof the roughly contemporaneous Heian court in Japan—if our dates are accurate,Kukai (774-835) in fact was a toddler when Samye was built in 77965—and mayhave had some Southeast Asian parallels as well (though the history of Javanese andof Khmer tantrism during this period remains, unfortunately, extremely obscure).Consider now the two verses of invocation Trhi Songdetsen offers to the wrathfuldeities Trailokyavijaya and Acala:Conqueror of the three realms [= Trailokyavijaya], heroic lord,To you, who tames by your splendor, respectfully I bow.May we definitely vanquishThe wrong views of the three worlds.Sublime Acala, who never trembles at all,To you, firmer than the power of Mount Meru, I bow.By all means, may we also not trembleWhen confronted by worlds of demons and enemies.66One hesitates to read too much into these and the other short verses opening theAuthentic Proof of the Scriptures, but it is probably significant that the martial imag-ery associated with these two divinities is emphasized here (as often it is in Japan aswell).67 The creation of the mandala overcomes adversity and tames the realm, elimi-nating opposition to a universal, benevolent order. It may well be that ideologicallythe esoteric Buddhism favored by the court was so favored precisely because it flat-tered the imperial self-image.The Testament ofBa, we have seen, reports that during the reign of Trhi Song-detsen's father, Trhi Detsuktsen (704-755/756), who assumed the throne as an infantin 705, emissaries were sent to the region of Mount Kailash to invite two Buddhistteachers who dwelt in retreat there to visit Central Tibet. They declined the royalsummons but sent books instead, and instructions for founding a number of temples.One of the hermits was named Buddhaguhya, or Buddhagupta, and it is a matter ofspeculation whether he is to be identified with a teacher of the same name who madegreat contributions to eighth-century tantric Buddhism in Tibet.68 Writings attrib-uted to the latter have been found at Dunhuang, and others are preserved in the Ti-betan Buddhist canons and in the traditions of the ancient Nyingmapa sect, whichtraces its roots to this period. The fundamental authenticity of these latter materialsin this case finds support at Dunhuang, for some of the documents discovered thereand attributed to our author do concern a particular version of the Great Perfection(rdzogs-cheri) system of meditation that resembles at least some of the materialpreserved by the later Nyingmapa tradition. This aspect of what we may call theBuddhagupta corpus has begun to be studied in recent years by Samten Karmay andNamkhai Norbu.69More to the point of the present discussion, however, is a considerable body oftexts also attributed to this figure and found in the canons. Much of this material isattested in the earliest extant catalogue of scriptures translated into Tibetan, the Dkar-chag Idan-kar-ma (The Denkar Palace Catalogue), which was compiled early in theninth century and reflects primarily the achievement of the translation committees"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Plague, Power, and Reason 63working during the reign of Trhi Songdetsen.70 Significantly, all of the four tantriccommentaries recorded there are works of Buddhagupta, and two of these concernthe Awakening of the Great Vairocana and the Sarvadurgatiparisodhanatantra (TheTantra Purifying All Evil Destinies).71 The latter tantra, also known from fragmentsat Dunhuang, has also been one of the primary texts relating to Vairocana in Tibet.72The thorough investigation of the tantric commentaries attributed to Buddhaguptaremains an important desideratum and promises to shed much light on Buddhisttantrism during the eighth century.73 In our present context, however, they are ofsignificance just because their presence in a palace catalogue suggests that the Ti-betan court, though in general not very enthusiastic to support the translation of tantricliterature, made a great exception on behalf of the commentarial traditions promul-gated by Buddhagupta and associated with Vairocana.The last group of materials I wish to survey in this connection has begun to re-ceive some attention among art historians and archeologists in recent years. Theobjects in question are a number of reliefs in stone, as well as several important cavemurals, all depicting a similar crowned and meditating Buddha, sometimes accom-panied by the eight major bodhisattvas. The Buddha is adorned with the ornamentsof the Body of Rapture (sambhogakaya); his two hands rest in his lap, and his legsare folded in the vajra posture. Iconographically, this figure closely resemblesthe Buddha who occupies the center of what in the Shingon school is termed theMahakaruna-garbha-mandala (The Womb Mandala of Great Compassion), namely,Mahavairocana.74The icon in question has been found in at least three locations in far eastern Tibetrecently studied by Amy Heller, where it is depicted in relief and accompanied byinscriptions dating to the early ninth century, to the reign of Trhi Songdetsen's sonTrhi Desongtsen.75 In one case, the inscription at Denmatrak, a lineage of masters ismentioned who are otherwise known from a Dunhuang Tibetan Chan text, a workthat was first studied and translated by Marcelle Lalou nearly a half century ago.76 Itis possible that the inscription is a slightly later addition, in which case the image ofMahavairocana at Denmatrak may in fact date to the reign of Trhi Songdetsen. Localfolklore attributes it to a much earlier period, to the princess of Wencheng's arrivalin Tibet in the early seventh century, but no evidence that has so far come to lightmakes this very plausible.77Besides these sculpted reliefs, a mural depicting a precisely similar form of Maha-vairocana, again surrounded by the eight bodhisattvas, is also known from Anxi Yulincave 25 in Gansu Province. This mural dates to the period of Tibetan occupation atthe end of the eighth century or the beginning of the ninth.78 That is, it may also beattributed to the reign of Trhi Songdetsen or that of his son Trhi Desongtsen. More-over, cave 14 at Dunhuang, although most of its murals date to just after the periodof Tibetan occupation, contains a portrait of Vairocana (in this case sometimes iden-tified as Avalokitesvara in meditation) that appears to resemble so closely the imagesof Vairocana just mentioned that either it must predate the remainder of the cave,and so be identified among the images under discussion, or else it was executed withdeliberate reference to them.79These facts point convincingly, I think, to the conclusion that the cult of Vairocanawas widely promulgated with imperial support, and that it expressed a significanthomology obtaining between, on the one hand, emperor and empire, and on the other,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"64 Conversion and NarrativeFigure 4.2 Left: Vairocana, Anxi Yulin cave 25 (after Anxi Yulinku).

The reliefs at Denmatrak or the murals at AnxiYulin, were, from this perspective, emblems of the Tibetan emperor's pervasive pres-ence and stern but benevolent authority throughout his domains. It is in this respectthat Christopher Beckwith has rightly referred to what he calls the \"kosmokratorsymbolism\" of Samye, that is, its demonstration of the imperial agency of a univer-sal legislator; and he further argues that in this respect Samye was of a piece withreligious symbols of imperial power throughout the early medieval world, be it spe-cifically the world of Carolingian Catholicism, Abbassid Islam, or Tibetan Bud-dhism.80 We may go further than this, I think, to find evidence here not only of thesymbolization of a particular world order, but of the active construction of that orderthrough the imperial promotion of religious monuments and icons. John Strong writesof the legend of Asoka's stupa building that,in building eighty-four thousand stupas over eighty-four thousand minute relics, Asokawas trying to reconstruct the Buddha's physical body on the face of his own realm,JambudvTpa.81And Strong concludes his analysis of the Indian emperor's project in these words:No longer are the Buddha's physical remains randomly dispersed here and there; theyare now cosmologically organized and spread throughout the kingdom. And no longerdoes the dharmakaya represent quite so naively just the corpus of the Buddha's Teach-ings; it is now more cosmological and has been systematically implanted in and iden-tified with the kingdom.82"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Plague, Power, and Reason 65Similarly, but now drawing on the ritual and symbolic resources of the tantras,Trhi Songdetsen and his successors sought not merely to present to their dominionsconceptual analogies and symbols, but rather to make use of these in a thorough-going \"mandalification\" of the kingdom that surely also involved the promotionthroughout Tibet of temples, teachers, book copying, ritual practices, and much elsebesides.83 The conversion of Tibet, therefore, was from this perspective much morethan the adoption of an alien religion, as if it were a question of the application of amere patina or veneer; it was to be the wholesale conversion, the fundamental trans-formation, of a human domain into a Buddha-realm, an empire governed by super-human insight, power, and law. For this indeed was the imperial ideal, already latentin indigenous Tibetan conceptions of the Tsenpo's divinity, and Buddhism providedan exceptional vehicle for the expression of it.84 Though the collapse of the Tibetanempire, and the reaction against Buddhism that it may have to some extent entailed,would in some respects undo this achievement, the fact that later Tibetan Buddhists,in their historical legends, came to see their land in just such terms points to moreenduring success.Converting the ConversionEarlier, I remarked that customarily, when we think of conversion, it is individualconversion that we have in mind. Following James, we sometimes think of this as asudden and dramatic reorientation of consciousness, marked by profound changesof sentiment and of faith.85 By contrast, what I have attempted to illustrate here isthat when it is conversion of a nation that is at issue, the gradual transformation ofcosmological frameworks, of ritual, intellectual, and bureaucratic practices, and ofthe historical and mythic narratives through which the national identity is constitutedare among the key themes to which we must attend.86 Moreover, in the case of Tibet,it is now clear that there were in fact two conversions that can perhaps be roughlycorrelated, but by no means identified, with the so-called earlier and later propaga-tions of the Buddha's teaching in that land.87 In the first instance, there was the im-perial adoption of Buddhism, which corresponded with the expansion of the old Ti-betan empire, the formation within it of a literate administration, and the need torepresent Tibetan imperial power both within and beyond the frontiers of Tibet. Inthe second, there was a conversion of the conversion narrative itself, ensuring thatthe Buddhist conquest of Tibet would endure long after the conquered empire hadvanished. It is tempting to speculate that it was the empire's adoption of the ritualsand symbols of esoteric Buddhism that in large measure forged the passage betweenthese two movements. That is to say, one of the chief means whereby the old empirerepresented itself as the realm of the Buddha's knowledge and power helps to ex-plain the myths that were later woven about it."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"PART IISOURCES OF CONTESTATION"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"From Korea to TibetAction at a Distance in the EarlyMedieval World System-libetan Buddhism has often been represented, by both Tibetans and non-Tibetanstudents of Tibetan culture, as the product of a strict and literal transmission of In-dian Buddhism, an almost invariant preservation of a perennial tradition, and it isindeed true that leading Tibetan Buddhist teachers have been careful students of IndianBuddhism. Despite the powerful and enduring role of Indian Buddhist sources andprecedents, however, it is clear that this view alone is far too simple. \"Indian Bud-dhism\" itself was not at all monolithic, and India imparted many and varied influ-ences to Tibet, which the Tibetans themselves received and transformed in many andvaried ways. Moreover, as is underscored in this chapter, not all of the Buddhism theTibetans transmitted came from India.The transmission of Buddhism in Tibet was always a dynamic process that in-volved the ongoing selection, in different places and times, of texts, doctrines, andpractices to be emphasized or marginalized, buried or retrieved. Even where thequestion is one of the transmission of a single element of the tradition, it may never-theless be subject to changing valuations and interpretations. According to the histo-ries of the various lineages, the interpretations of different masters, the changes ofopinion catalyzed by discussion and debate, the institutional culture of particularmonasteries and monastic colleges, as well as the interests of patrons, what was trans-mitted could also be transformed. Evidently, it makes little sense to think of trans-mission as a process whereby identical learning was reproduced invariantly in eachgeneration, like a series of objects stamped out on a factory conveyor.Understanding transmission then to be not rigid replication, but a dynamic pro-cess in which preservation also involved change, a continuous re-creation of tradi-tion through both selective reappropriation of the past and innovation, all of this bookmay be said to deal with one or another aspect of this process. In this chapter, I intro-duce some aspects of it by focusing on materials that were indeed subject to various,and sometimes odd, erasures and recoveries. This chapter also reflects, owing to itsconcern with East Asian Buddhism in Tibet, certain of the themes touched upon inpart 1. It serves as an illustration of Tibet's participation in the international cultureof Buddhism, and, at the same time, of the assimilation and transmission in Tibet ofmaterials made available through such participation.5"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"70 Sources of ContestationAn Island in the Eastern SeaRecent research has demonstrated that aspects of Korean Buddhism contributed tothe formation of Tibetan Buddhism in some instances. The contributions in questionall occurred during the Tang period (618-907), were largely forgotten, but exerteddiscernible influence on Tibetan thought long afterwards nevertheless. Thus, despitetheir relative obscurity, or perhaps by virtue of it, they exemplify aspects of the gen-eral problem of the transmission of religious learning within the Tibetan world. Theinvestigation of the transmission of Buddhist teachings from Korean sources to Tibetduring the Tang period and their later legacy there presents us, too, with an interest-ing case study in cultural influence from the perspective of world-systems theoryand so in this respect may offer something more than the footnote to the history ofEast Asian and Tibetan Buddhism that otherwise is all, I am afraid, one may reason-ably hope to find here.It is appropriate to begin by asking what the Tibetans in fact may have known ofKorea. The short answer, of course, is virtually nothing, and, as will become clear,whatever was received from Korea was presumed to be Chinese (or, in the case ofthe Vajrasamadhisutra, originally Indian). Indeed, this was the case with traditionalTibetan conceptions of most of what we would term \"East Asia\"; more nuanceddescriptions were in general only employed when referring to peoples, like theMongols or Uighurs, with whom the Tibetans were also directly familiar in non-Chinese contexts and so continued to distinguish carefully even when the generalframework for the relationship was a sinitic one. Owing to their station, China's for-eign rulers—Mongols during the Yuan Dynasty and Manchus during the Qing—wereperhaps treated ambiguously in some contexts: a common expression such as gyanakgongma (rgya-nag gong-ma), for instance, may be read as either \"emperor of China\"or \"Chinese emperor\" and so is altogether indifferent with respect to the rulers'ethnicity.1Nevertheless, it is certain that some of the Tibetans who traveled to the Chinesecourt during the Tang, Yuan and Ming dynasties would have at least heard of thekingdoms of Korea. To the extent that they left written records of this, however, theyare limited to the mere occurrence of the place-name.2 The explicit descriptions ofKorea in traditional Tibetan sources of which I am aware are very late, dating to themid-Qing dynasty. Sumpa Khenpo Yeshe Peljor (1704-1787), writing a generalaccount of world geography in 1777, refers in a terse phrase to lands lying in andabout the eastern ocean, including Manchuria (manju'i so) and the \"little island ofKorea\" (gling chung ku'u If)? The work in question is by no means so uninforma-tive about all that it mentions; its discussion of Siberia, for instance, includes what Itake to be the first Tibetan reference to polar bears.4 Sumpa Khenpo, moreover, didsucceed in arousing some interest in the study of geography among the Tibetan lite-rati of his time. In the most famous treatise that he inspired, the 'Dzam-gling rgyas-bshad (A Full Exposition of Jambudvipa), written in 1830 by the fourth Tsenpo,Tendzin Trhinle (1789-1838), we find discussions of the departments of France, andeven a mention of Louisiana.5 Korea is briefly described in the following entry:Proceeding from China to traverse Manchuria, when one travels east, there is Khro-zhang (< Ch. Chaoxian), the land of those called Kwo-le (< Ch. Gaoli), or, by the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"From Korea to Tibet 71Indians, Russians, and others, Ko-ri-ya. The people of that land are well-proportionedand handsome. Their customs are deep, and their way of dress, script, and so forth,resemble those of China in former times, though the language is of a different type.The women of that land are said never to be seen on any occasion, except by theirown parents, husbands, sonset cetera.6It is clear, then, that Tibetans in China did sometimes hear of Korea and perhapscould gain some slight impression of that land and its people. But it seems equallyclear that they never associated these reports with the Buddhist materials we shallconsider here. With the understanding, then, that Tibetans would always understandthe instances of Korean influence on Tibetan Buddhism to have been Chinese influ-ences, let us turn directly to the cases that have so far come to light.The Tamer of TigersOne of the great fascinations of modern scholarship concerning the early history ofTibetan Buddhism has been the often perplexing evidence of the transmission andlegacy of Chinese Chan Buddhism in Tibet. During the 1970s, in particular, Japa-nese researchers devoted considerable energy to this area.7It was Hironobu Obata who first pointed out the importance of a passage in theversion of the Sba-bzhed (The Testament of Ba) that had been published by Stein.8I offer here a translation of the passage in question, following not Stein's text, butthe apparently earlier recension that appeared in Beijing in 1980.9 The episode oc-curs when, towards the end of the reign of Trhi Detsuktsen, the father of the greatBuddhist monarch Trhi Songdetsen, five emissaries headed by Ba Sangshi are sentto China to receive Chinese \"wisdom\" (gtsug-lag).w Ba Sangshi is himself a puz-zling figure, whom the Testament ofBa presents as a Tibetanized Chinese, thoughsome passages seem ambiguous about his origins.11 Having succeeded in their mis-sion at the court, he and his companions are now en route back to Tibet:On the road along which the five emissaries were traveling to Tibet was a rock out-cropping around which no one could move.12 Whoever saw it died in landslides.13 Thepowerful Kim Hwa-shang14 of the city of Eg-chu, who was able to harness a tiger,and who was clairvoyant, entered into meditation for three days at the order of hispreceptor.15 In this way he shattered the rock and then built a temple in the tamed spacethat was left. He also then had that region put under plough. Separating [some of thefields] as temple-lands, he came back to Eg-chu, whereupon the Tibetan emissariesreceived a meditation transmission [from him]. When they asked for prognosticationsabout what would then happen, asking whether the Buddha's doctrine would be es-tablished in Tibet, or if the life-threatening demons of Tibet might not act up if theBuddha's scriptures were proclaimed, and whether or not the Tsenpo and his son wereat ease, the Hwa-shang investigated [these matters] clairvoyantly. Then he responded,\"The Tsenpo has passed away. Because the prince has not attained his majority, theministers who delight in evil have enacted laws whereby they have destroyed thedoctrine, tearing down to the foundations a spiritual center called Drakmar Drinzang.16If you are to spread the doctrine, take care that the Tsenpo reaches adulthood. Lateron, when as king he attains his majority, he will order discussions concerning a doc-"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"72 Sources of Contestationtrine of the non-Buddhist sophists.17 When that occurs, ask that he hear this, andthen faith will be born in the prince. Afterward, request that he listen to this, andthe prince will then practice the doctrine.\" Saying this, he granted them three vol-umes as prophesied.18After this, following a final prophecy concerning the future arrival in Tibet of Santar-aksita, he sends the envoys on their way with adequate provisions. Brokenhearted atthe news concerning the destruction of Drakmar Drinzang, they return to Tibet viaWutaishan, a very great detour.19Several of the elements in this account in fact are sufficiently circumstantial so thatwe may suspect that some knowledge of true events lies in the background. Obatanoticed, among other matters, that the place name \"Eg-chu\" in our text is in fact afairly good representation of the Tang period pronunciation of Yizhou, *Iak-tsiau inKalgren's reconstruction,20 that is to say, modern Chengdu, where the Silla master ofthe northern Chan school, Kim Hwasang (Ch. Jin Heshang), was active during theperiod of the An Lushan rebellion.21 The death of the Tibetan emperor Trhi Detsuktsenindeed occurred during just this time, in 755/7S6,22 so that it seems certain that ourtext preserves here an authentic recollection, even if not fully accurate, of actual affairs.Before taking this any further, however, we should once more recall that the ori-gins and dating of the Testament ofBa have remained vexing problems for studentsof Tibetan historiography. In the episode we are considering here the two availabletexts are closely similar, and it is difficult to imagine that any late author could havemade up the details of the account out of whole cloth, even if the Testament ofBa is,as seems likely, a relatively late composition (post-tenth century) in the versions thathave become available so far. At the very least, the account must be based on origi-nal documents going back to the eighth or ninth century.23That some Tibetans during this period knew of master Kim by reputation, although,as Obata surmised, he probably had no direct Tibetan disciples,24 is further suggestedby some of the Tibetan Chan documents discovered at Dunhuang, as well as by cer-tain later sources. In the most famous of the Tibetan Chan collections from Dunhuang,PT 116,25 we find two quotations attributed to the Chdnlun (Chan Discourse)26 ofone Kim-hu(n)-shen-shi. J. Broughton has already proposed that this might refer tomaster Kim.27 Their content is consistent with many of the Chan maxims of the pe-riod, but in itself this neither supports nor damages the case for attributing them toKim. I offer translations of them here for the convenience of readers:I. From the Chan Discourse of the preceptor Kim-hun-shen-shi:If mind is in equilibrium, all principles are in equilibrium.If there is awareness of the genuine, there is nothing that is not a principle ofthe buddha.When the objective is understood, the mind that thirsts and desires does notarise.Even when you are not immediately involved in the sphere of the genuine,you will not seek it.28If you ask, why is that?It is because the essential nature of the transcendental perfection ofdiscernment,Being primordially in equilibrium, is never objectified.29"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"From Korea to Tibet 73II. From the Chan Discourse of the preceptor Kim-hu:For the man who meditatively cultivates the path,To be free from all conception of views,Is called the \"sole intuition.\"30When [you are] thus endowed with that intuition,None of the afflictions of latent dispositions arise.That is the path of liberation.31As is characteristic of the Chan teaching elsewhere attributed to master Kim, theemphasis in these passages is on an intuitive realization that is entirely independentof works.32 Indeed, there is a sense in which some of the Chan teachings of this pe-riod resemble in part those of Luther in their insistence upon a radical internal trans-formation that is neither the product of nor reducible to one's virtuous deeds. Andlike some of the strains of early Protestantism that were condemned as antinomian,33the charge of antinomianism would become central to the condemnation in Tibet ofthe Chan teaching, above all as it was represented by the Heshang Moheyan.34Only the vaguest memory of master Kim's teaching was preserved among laterTibetans. Both of the passages just cited—assuming that they are indeed Kim's—found their way, with some variations, into the chapter on sudden enlightenment ina famous early manual of the Great Perfection (Rdzogs-chen) system, the Bsam-gtanmig-sgron (The Lamp for the Eye of Dhyana), by Nupchen Sang'gye Yeshe (c. tenthcentury),35 a work that was very widely transmitted through roughly the thirteenthcentury, after which time it virtually disappeared. This text, however, was almostcertainly the source employed by Orgyen Lingpa (b. 1323; see chapter 9) in the com-position of the analogous chapter of his work, the Blon-po bka 'i thang-yig (TheTestimonial Record of the Ministers), which is presented as a rediscovered treasure(gter-md) originally set down in the eighth century. It reproduces the first of ourpassages with some further deformations.36 The apocryphal histories of OrgyenLingpa, however, have remained popular works of literature down to the present day,and so, however obscured and attenuated, some recollection of master Kim's wordshas possibly been preserved through this source.It is important, now, that I say something of the general neglect of master Kim inthe later Tibetan Buddhist historical literature, for we learn much about the trans-mission of Buddhism in Tibet by seeking to understand why many things that hadbeen introduced were not transmitted, indeed even erased from the record, later on.Only one of the later histories repeats in any detail the Testament ofBa's account ofthe meeting with Kim in Chengdu, and this is Pawo Tsuklaktrhenga's Mkhas-pa'idga'-ston (The Scholars' Banquet), a work into which, as we have seen (p. 46),much of the text of the Testament ofBa was to all intents and purposes downloaded.37The neglect of the episode on the part of other Tibetan historians, particularly Buton,is sometimes taken to be a sign of the purportedly anti-Chinese perspective of theseauthors. Though such assumptions were certainly tenable not long ago, in the lightof our present knowledge of the development of Tibetan historiography they appearto be less sure: as we have seen, late Tibetan views of relatively early Tibetan his-tory, and of Tibet's relations with China, themselves have had a long and compli-cated history. This is not to say that there were no anti-Chinese sentiments presentamong Tibetan historical writers; in Buton's day, reaction to the Yuan dynasty's"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"74 Sources of Contestationpresumptions in Tibet had certainly been given literary expression.38 We are not jus-tified, however, in seeking to find such sentiments underlying every narrative deci-sion. Why poor master Kim should have borne the brunt of Tibetan antipathy toChina's Mongol overlords would need to be better clarified before we can acceptthis to have motivated his excision from the record.39Beyond the vagaries of human memory, there are several factors that may explainwhy Tibetan historians generally neglected the tale of the meeting of the envoys withmaster Kim. To begin, Tibetan religious historiography focused primarily upon lin-eage history, and there was no enduring Tibetan Chan lineage stemming from Kim'steaching. Though, as we shall soon see, elements of Chan teaching did indeed sur-vive in some Tibetan Buddhist circles, the Chan tradition generally was subject tothe criticism of those who favored bona fide Indian teachings. The attenuated sur-vivals of Chan were therefore for the most part disguised. To all intents and pur-poses, therefore, master Kim had no place in any existing Tibetan lineage and henceno place in any narration of lineage history. The importance of this principle for thereconstruction of the history of the conversion narrative is crucial, for it is clear thatthe roles played by such figures as Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra, shadowy atbest in the earlier versions, expand as they themselves assume greater importancefor later Tibetan esoteric traditions.40It is likely, too, that the Testament ofBa, in which the meeting with master Kimis found, was composed as a vindication and eulogy of the members of the Ba clanwho are often regarded its authors. While it was universally acknowledged that thesefigures did play a crucial role in the conversion of Tibet, still, as L. Petech has morerecently argued, the early second millenium saw the gradual eclipsing of the oldministerial clans of Central Tibet, including the Ba, and the attendant rise of power-ful households that were opposed to them.41 The tale of master Kim probably hadfew compelling resonances for those who were heirs to families that identified them-selves in no way with traditions stemming from eighth-century China, but insteadwith the circle of Padmasambhava and his disciples, or with the new transmissionsof the eleventh century. Under such circumstances, our tale held only antiquarianinterest, which accounts for its revival in the work of an antiquarian author like PawoTsuklaktrhenga, while it continued to be neglected by historians who were moreconcerned to retell the history of the old Tibetan dynasty as a myth that reflectedtheir own interests and those of their contemporaries.Ambitious eleventh-century Tibetan Buddhists were not so much actively opposedto China as they were drawn to India, and this attraction had much to do during theperiod in question with issues of legitimation and power in Tibet,42 but such factorsas the relative proximity of India and Nepal to West and Central Tibet also must notbe neglected; these regions of Tibet during the eleventh century enjoyed a rich cul-tural and material trade with both Kashmir and the Kathmandu Valley, and thence toother parts of India, that had no parallel in Tibetan relations with the Chinese Songdynasty, which were in any case largely mediated by the Western Xia kingdom.43 Insuch times as these, an old story in difficult and perhaps already archaic languageabout the master of an unknown meditation lineage from China would have been, ifnothing else, simply out of fashion.For all of this, however, master Kim possibly did leave some enduring traces inlater popular Tibetan traditions. We have seen already that at least one quotation that"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"From Korea to Tibet 75is perhaps to be attributed to him remained in circulation. One final item piquesour curiosity before we move on: in one of his most well known manifestations,Padmasambhava is depicted as a wrathful suppressor of demons, riding a tiger.Though the evidence is too slender to permit an answer, this raises a question never-theless: may we discern here a last faint reflection of the ancient tale of a KoreanChan master in Sichuan?44Chan Traces in Later TraditionsThough Tibetan Chan certainly faded away, it would not be quite accurate to saythat it ever actually died. Again, recent research makes it clear that the entire story isfar more complicated than we had previously imagined it to be, and our sources,though often tantalizing, are seldom so illuminating as we would like.451 mentionhere just a few conclusions that will be required as background, but I will refrainfrom elaborating the full basis for these conclusions here.Whether or not the last decades of the eighth century really saw the expulsion ofthe Heshang Moheyan from Central Tibet and the banning of certain Chan writingsthere, as the Testament ofBa and other sources maintain, it is now clear that the earlyninth century witnessed the rise of a syncretic Tibetan Chan lineage based in north-eastern Tibet (Amdo) and also active in and around Dunhuang. This lineage seemsto have operated very widely in the eastern portions of the Tibetan empire, almostcertainly under the patronage of Trhi Songdetsen's son and grand-successor, TrhiDesongtsen, or his representatives.46 While this line of Chan teaching appears tohave preserved a radical teaching of sudden enlightenment, it also seems to havecontextualized it within a framework of normative Buddhist cosmology, emphasiz-ing the doctrine of karma, and probably also to have transmitted it in association withsome tantric ritual and contemplative disciplines.47 Assuming this to have been thecase, the masters of this tradition may have successfully distanced themselves fromsome of the tendencies the monarchy is said to have found objectionable in the teach-ing of Moheyan, specifically, its radically antinomian character.48 Furthermore, thereis some reason to believe that elements of the Chan teaching, perhaps stemming fromthis very lineage (though positive evidence for this is lacking), remained current infar eastern Tibet at least through the beginning of the eleventh century.49The precise fate of this and other remnants of early Tibetan Chan remains verymuch a mystery. Not long ago it was widely assumed that it was primarily within theGreat Perfection (rdzogs-chen) systems of the Nyingmapa and Bon traditions thatclear evidence of the continuity of Chan in Tibet was to be found, but it now appearsthat this is an oversimplification. On the one hand, the Great Perfection is known toinvolve much more than whatever of its aspects can plausibly be traced back to Chaninfluence: \"Great Perfection\" refers to a highly ramified family of systems that are,doctrinally and historically, far too complicated to reduce to a single source or impe-tus.50 And on the other hand, it is now clear that the Great Perfection was not aloneamong the Tibetan meditational traditions in absorbing surviving elements of the Chanteaching; from an early date the Kagyupa proponents of the Mahamudra and, as Ishall indicate later, others as well, adopted certain materials from Chan sources.51Tracing out the precise legacy of Chan in Tibet is thus an intricate and difficult mat-"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"76 Sources of Contestationter. One of the tracking devices that can be usefully employed here, rather like fluo-rescent dust on banknotes, interestingly turns out to be the Vajrasamadhisutra (TheSutra of Adamantine Concentration).52The Korean composition of the Vajrasamadhisutra has been reasonably estab-lished by Robert Buswell in his fine book devoted to that scripture.53 Of course, inthe circles in which it was transmitted and enjoyed much popularity during the Tangperiod, it was not at all thought to be of Korean authorship and was accepted as anauthentic Indian sutra.54 No doubt its translation from Chinese into Tibetan reflectedboth its general popularity and, perhaps, too, its importance to some of the Chan lin-eages that had become influential among at least some Tibetan Buddhists.55 Its apoc-ryphal character no less than its content may have facilitated its early translation intoTibetan, for there is evidence to suggest that popular, apocryphal sutras translatedfrom the Chinese were among the first Buddhist texts to become available in Tibet.56Though the version of the Vajrasamadhi preserved in the Tibetan canons is with-out the customary translator's colophon, its inclusion in the early-ninth-centuryDenkar palace catalogue of Buddhist scriptures confirms that it had been translatedfrom the Chinese sometime earlier.57 Its citation in Dunhuang Tibetan Chan collec-tions suggests that it was in circulation there during the early ninth century at thelatest.58 Thus, it comes as no surprise to see the Vajrasamadhi cropping up in a cat-echistic section of PT116, the same manuscript that preserves citations from the ChanDiscourses we have already examined, for example:How is it evident that the Mahayana is subsumed in nonconceptualization?The Vajrasamadhisutra says:Without thought or reflection, arising and sinking will not come about, and onebecomes unwavering in just what genuinely is. That is the sutra of the Mahayana.59Despite the preservation of the Vajrasamadhisutra in the later Kanjur collections,there is no evidence that there was ever any tradition, of study associated with it inTibet, most certainly not after the disappearance of the Tibetan Chan lineagestowards the end of the first millenium. Nevertheless, because passages from theVajrasamadhi, like some of the sayings of master Kim and other Chan teachers, hadbeen incorporated in the Tibetan Chan anthologies, they later came to be incorpo-rated in the handbooks of certain Tibetan traditions of meditation. In this context,the Vajrasamadhisutra had one very useful feature that the sayings of Kim and theChinese Chan masters did not: it was believed to be an authentic sutra spoken by theBuddha himself. For this reason, citations from it could continue to be employed longafter Chan itself came to be considered anathematic, even where political correct-ness or an instinct for self-preservation demanded that many of the other quotationsfrom the old Chan manuals be dropped.The Lamp for the Eye ofDhyana, as we have seen, clearly employed Chan collec-tions like PT 116, and so it comes as little surprise that we find some citations fromthe sutra there as well. For instance, we read: \"It says in the Vajrasamadhisutra: 'Ifmind is unwavering in emptiness, then the six transcending perfections are subsumedtherein.'\"60As D. Jackson has recently observed, moreover, such passages begin turning upin the writings of Milarepa's noted disciple Gampopa (1079-1153) and the latter'sKagyiipa followers as well, often in connection with a much contested doctrine some-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"From Korea to Tibet 77times called the \"mahamudra of the sutra tradition\" (mdo-lugs phyag-chen).61 Thisteaching was said to bring about direct insight into the ultimate nature of mind,owing to the impact of an \"introduction\" (ngo-sprod; see chapter 10) conferred byone's teacher, without the disciple's having first traversed the entire sequence oftantric initiation and yogic practice. Thus, in the most widely studied of Gampopa'swritings, the Thar-pa rin-po-che'i rgyan (The Jewel Ornament of Liberation), thechapter concerning contemplative insight, or discernment (prajna, shes-rab), ar-gues for the identity of the culminating teachings of the sutras and tantras on thispoint. It is there that we find just the same passage from the Vajrasamadhisutraonce more.62Jackson's argument, with which I generally concur, is that it is very unlikely thatGampopa and his cohorts were deriving such quotations directly from the sutras cited;rather, they probably were culling them from preexisting meditation manuals, textslike PT 116 or the Lamp for the Eye ofDhyana. They were careful only to employpassages attributed to sutras in this manner, however, for they certainly wished toavoid suggesting that what they were teaching was a rehashing of the Chinese Chandoctrine, which after all had been condemned in the Kadampa tradition of the elev-enth-century teacher Potowa (1027 or 1031-1105), a tradition with which Gampopawas himself closely affiliated.63 This ploy, however, was not fully successful. SakyaPandita (1182-1251), for one, recognized very clearly that the Kagyiipa teaching drewsome of its inspiration from such sources, and so he castigated its \"sutra tradition ofthe mahamudra\" as what he termed, with apparent derision, \"Chinese Great Perfec-tion\" (Rgya-nag rdzogs-cheri).64The spread of passages from the Vajrasamadhisutra, however, demonstrates thateven this is too simple. In a Kadampa meditation manual of the twelfth century, theMan-ngag rin-chen spungs-pa (The Jewel Heap of Esoteric Instruction), we have achapter on sudden enlightenment that includes citations from many sutras, amongwhich one reads:In the Vajrasamadhisutra it says:If there be no ignorance in the original matrix of mind, then what might one say ofthe conditioning factors emerging from ignorance, and so on down to birth and death?65There is good reason to believe that the author, one Cegomdzongpa Sherap Dorje,despite his affiliation with the Kadampa line of Potowa, nevertheless was sympa-thetic to the meditational traditions of the Nyingmapa and Kagyiipa schools.66 Thushe may have been moved to incorporate the teaching of the nontantric approach tosudden enlightenment, insofar as he could derive it from these traditions, within theotherwise normative Kadampa framework of the gradual path. In this, he was per-haps following Gampopa's lead.67 Having succeeded in wedging the swift foot ofimmediacy into the slow-swinging gate of Kadampa gradualism, however, he insuredthat some element of the Chan teaching would be preserved for posterity by some ofits most determined opponents. For in later times the successors to the Kadampa were,above all, the Gelukpa followers of Tsongkhapa (1357-1419), and it is in their tra-dition alone that Cegomdzongpa's work has continued to be transmitted, even downto the present day.68 The learned geshe (dge-bshes, a Gelukpa scholar who has com-pleted his examinations in doctrine and philosophy) with whom I discussed it admit-ted that he found the sudden-enlightenment chapter to be in some respects a puz-"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"78 Sources of Contestationzling inclusion, but he maintained that the Gelukpa treasure the book as a whole forits particularly eloquent synthesis of the Mahayana path nonetheless.69The legacy of Chan in Tibet, then, can by no means be regarded, as sometimes ithas been, as a matter of a single impetus uniquely imparted to one well-defined tra-dition. The Vajrasamadhi is in no way our only guide to its broad but subtle diffu-sion. Nevertheless, it is often the case that citations such as those we have just beenconsidering provide a valuable clue—perhaps not quite a smoking pistol—allowingus to trace at least some of its furtive movements.70The Vicissitudes of the Great Chinese CommentaryOne final example of Korean sources in the background of the development ofTibetan Buddhism leads us at last away from the Chan traditions but will keep usclose to the Gelukpas in Tibet. Wonchtik's (613-696) great commentary on theSamdhinirmocanasutra (The Sutra Which Sets Free the [Buddha's] Intention) is nowwell known among scholars of East Asian Buddhism to have been rendered inTibetan by Go Chodrup, or, as he was known in Chinese, Facheng, a renowned trans-lator based in Dunhuang and active there during the early ninth century.71 It has beenpreserved in this translation, no doubt with some changes due to editorial practice,in the printed Tanjur editions of recent times,72 though the integral text in Chinesewas lost long ago.73 The role that it has played in Tibetan thought is intriguing andmerits consideration in relation to the dynamics of Tibetan doctrinal history. In thisrespect, its position has also been to some degree misunderstood.The Tibetan canons, to begin, are massive collections that include vast quantitiesof material that, excepting for the occasional interventions of editors, printers, andcopyists, few ever look at, much less read.74 Indeed, reading the canon—understand-ing this phrase by analogy to contemporary anglophone conceptions of \"readingScripture\"75—was generally not a very important cultural practice in Tibet; most lit-erate people read primarily the texts that they had been personally taught to read,including manuals and liturgies for the rituals they performed and meditations theypracticed, as well as letters, horoscopes, and sometimes, too, histories, biographies,and storybooks that were thought to be diverting or edifying. Even the minority ofmonks who pursued programs of doctrinal and philosophical study focused for themost part on a very small number of fundamental texts and the commentaries uponthem considered authoritative in the particular colleges in which they were enrolled.76Accomplished scholars certainly cultivated greater breadth and often sought to fa-miliarize themselves with the textbooks and commentaries current in various cen-ters of learning, but they seldom devoted much thought to works that were not invogue in any of the contemporary schools—only the rarest of masters deliberatelycultivated the study of rarely studied books. The idea of combing the Tanjur for abig commentary that had no active tradition of transmission might occur to one ofour Ph.D. students, swayed by professorial encouragement while shopping for a dis-sertation topic, but in general it would have seemed a pretty odd thing to do inTibet.77It is with this in mind that the history in Tibet of W<5nch'tik's great commentarybecomes something of a mystery, for, though it was not actually transmitted in any"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"From Korea to Tibet 79living line of teaching that is known to us, there was a flurry of interest in it duringthe fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries that has had some legacy in the later scho-lasticism of the Gelukpa school, in recent centuries the dominant Tibetan Buddhisttradition. The reasons for the occasional references to it found within Gelukpa scho-lastic textbooks are entirely clear and very well known: Tsongkhapa (1357-1419)cites it in two of his most widely studied treatises, the Drang-nges legs-bshad snying-po (The Provisional and the Definitive: The Essence of Eloquence)78 and the Yid dangkun-gzhi 'i dka'- 'grel (The Commentary on Difficulties in Relation to the Intellectand the Ground-of-All).79 Later Gelukpa citations of Wonch'uk, so far as I have beenable to ascertain, can all be traced back to the inspiration of these works.80 The puzzlethat must be addressed, therefore, is what was the basis for Tsongkhapa's interest?This question has been raised previously. R. A. F. Thurman, in his masterful trans-lation of the Essence of Eloquence, speculated that Tsongkhapa cited W<3nch'uk inan effort to deliver Chinese Buddhism from the \"stigma\" of association with the con-demned teaching of Heshang Moheyan. But as J. Powers rightly argues in an articledevoted to the Great Commentary in Tibet, this was not at all probable.81 In fact,Powers never clearly states why not, but, as we have seen, the \"stigma\" was by nomeans so complete or so uniform as has sometimes been supposed, and so it is notreally plausible that Tsongkhapa would have considered this a problem he neededespecially to address. Certainly he and his contemporary scholiasts knew well thatChinese Buddhism was not monolithic, and only philosophical simpletons would haveidentified all of Chinese Buddhism with the teaching of Moheyan.82 In the two workswe are considering, Tsongkhapa was by no means writing for simpletons.The alternative explanation offered by Powers, however, is also unconvincing.Tsongkhapa was aware, he reasons, that the \"Great Chinese Commentary\" was thelargest commentary on the Samdhinirmocana preserved in Tibetan, and because hewas interested in this surra in connection with his study of various problems of doc-trinal interpretation, being a \"meticulous scholar\" he read WSnch'uk and reportedupon his researches in his writings.83 Now, there can be no doubt that Tsongkhapawas indeed a most meticulous scholar and merits all praise in this regard. Neverthe-less, we must take care not to project back upon him a conception of the traditionalTibetan scholar that closely mirrors his contemporary Western counterpart; we mustendeavor to avoid, that is, seeing in our Tibetan forebears merely projections of our-selves. Though it is indeed the case that Tibetan scholars did sometimes read booksthat others neglected, so that we do sometimes find citations that cannot be other-wise explained, the student of Tibetan intellectual history must always start with theassumption that even the greatest of Tibetan monastic scholars were interested aboveall in the interpretation of received tradition. Before leaping to other conclusions inorder to explain the apparently odd fact of Tsongkhapa's recourse to Wdnch'tfk, it istherefore first necessary to consider whether it may have played a role in the back-ground of Tsongkhapa's own formation. The question that we must pose aboutTsongkhapa in this instance is this: had Wdnch'tik's work come to be actively stud-ied in fourteenth-century Tibet, and, if so, how did this occur?With this question in mind, when we turn to investigate some of the traditionsof fourteenth-century Sakyapa and Kadampa scholasticism with which we knowTsongkhapa to have been familiar, we soon discover that several of the same pas-sages from Wdnch'iik cited by Tsongkhapa had already been placed in circulation"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"80 Sources of Contestationby his teachers and predecessors. Tsongkhapa was neither seeking to redeem wronglydisparaged traditions of Chinese Buddhism, nor was he a research scholar engaging inentirely new philological investigations. He was, rather, a Tibetan scholastic interpreterdoing what Tibetan scholastic interpreters do best, that is, enlarging and elaboratingthe commentarial traditions in which he himself had been trained.84 It is the basis forhis predecessors' interest in WSnch'uk, then, that we must seek to establish.In the Essence of Eloquence, Tsongkhapa was concerned in part with the prob-lem of determining which among the \"three turns of the wheel\"—the three greatphases in the Buddha's disclosure of his teaching—were to be assessed as, respec-tively, of provisional or definitive meaning.85 As will be seen in the following chap-ter (in the section concerning Dolpopa), this had emerged as a focal point of debateduring the preceding century owing to sustained disagreements between thosewho regarded the culminating philosophical teaching of Buddhism to be found inCandrakTrti' s interpretations of the Madhyamaka philosophy of Nagarjuna, and thosewho, by contrast, sought to discover the highest teaching of the Buddha in the doc-trine of Buddha-nature, whose philosophical elaboration was to be found above allin aspects of the tradition stemming from the divine bodhisattva Maitreya and hishuman disciple Asanga.86 Tibetan proponents of the latter tradition had often turnedto a famous passage in the Samdhinirmocana (given below, p. 113) concerning thethree turns in support of their approach to interpretation. An important question thisraised, of course, was just how the Samdhinirmocana itself was to be understood,and so this was one of the areas in which Tsongkhapa turned to the authority ofWOnch'uk. It was not, however, an original move on his part: Tsongkhapa's mentorin the Candraklrti tradition, the noted Sakyapa master, Remdawa Zhonu Lodro (1349-1412), had referred similarly to the Korean master in just the same context. In fact atthe very beginning of his introduction to his excellent and influential commentaryon Candraklrti's Madhymakavatara (The Introduction to the Madhyamaka), afterbriefly introducing the three turns, he remarks:The Chinese preceptor [Wdnch'uk] has said that this is explained in the commentaryby sublime Nagarjuna on the skill-in-means chapter of the Transcendent Perfectionof Discernment.87And he goes on to cite here Paramartha (Ch. Zhendi, Tib. Yang-dag-bden)—theIndian master of Yogacara Buddhism who taught in Canton in the sixth century—reference to whom was also no doubt derived from Wfinch'uk's work.88 Later hequotes Wonch'tik once again at length:Again, in the commentary on the Samdhinirmocana, the Chinese preceptor says: \"Itemerges from the expositions of the Tripitaka, concerning those three wheels of doc-trine, that about one hundred years after the Buddha's nirvana, the masters of the twentyorders composed the commentaries on the first wheel of doctrine, each according tohis own knowledge. Then, when two hundred years had passed after the Buddha'snirvana, the bodhisattva Nagarjuna composed treatises based on the surras of thePrajnaparamita, to whit, the commentary on the Prajnaparamita, the Madhyamaka, etc.There, the way of the absence of characteristics is well taught, having rejected im-puted essences.

Master Asanga and Vasubandhu rightly ac-cepted that textual tradition and promulgated it. At that time, because the doctrine ofthe Buddha is of a single savor, there were no conflicts between those proponents ofemptiness and of existence.\"89Clearly, then, Remdawa was very much interested in W6nch'uk' s work. It remainsobscure, though, how he came to be so interested. On considering another of the mainreferences to WSnch'uk in Tsongkhapa's writings, we come across an additional clue,for in the Commentary on Difficulties Tsongkhapa relates a minor disagreement be-tween himself and an earlier Kadampa scholar named Comden Rikpei Reldri (activeduring the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries).90 This occurs in connec-tion with some technical problems in the Yogacara philosophy of mind, namely, thequestion of whether, in addition to the eight types of consciousness discussed in themajor Indian Yogacara writings, one had also to assume, as Paramarma had done, aninth consciousness, a \"taintless consciousness\" (Skt. amala(vi)jnana) conceived asa purified correlate of the consciousness of the ground-of-all (Skt. alayavijnana,Tib. kun-gzhi'i rnam-par-shes-pa).91 The topics at issue are, as before, stronglyconnected to important points of dispute in Tibet throughout the fourteenth cen-tury.92 Rikpei Reldri had been, in fact, one of the most influential Kadampascholiasts of the period, and, despite the later neglect of his works, in Tsongkhapa'sday they appear to have been still widely studied.Unfortunately, the writings of Rikpei Reldri that have been published so far donot include his reflections on the ground-of-all consciousness and associated subjectmatter, so that we do not yet have access to whatever illumination his works provideregarding the particular issues at stake here.93 The remainder of the argument in thissection, therefore, is to some extent speculative and may be confirmed or refutedonly by the appearance of new sources.Among the important disciples and associates of Rikpei Reldri was a scholar namedChim Jamyang, who became the court chaplain of the Yuan emperor Buyantu (reigned1311-1320).94 The major work of Chim Jamyang that is now available is his largecommentary on the Abhidharmakosa (The Treasury of the Meta-Doctrine), the writ-ing of which he began in Sakya but completed during his sojourn in China.95 He refersclearly here to Paramartha's nine-consciousness theory,96 which, as we have seen,Tsongkhapa knew through Wonch'iik. It is plausible that Chim Jamyang, like manyother Tibetan prelates who spent long periods in the Chinese capital during the Yuandynasty, and again like those who dwelt in Beijing four centuries later under the Qing,had occasion to take more than a casual interest in Chinese Buddhist traditions andso may have read with some care relevant texts preserved in Tibetan.97 The system-atic comparison of the Chinese and Tibetan Buddhist canons had indeed been spon-sored by the Yuan court,98 so that in this setting it would have made good sense todelve into the Great Commentary.99 Assuming something like this to have been thecase, Chim Jamyang may well have been the source of his master Rikpei Reldri'sknowledge of W6nch'rik, and thence of Remdawa's. That these scholars drew uponW6nch'uk in connection with the theories of the triple turn of the wheel, the nineconsciousnesses, and the taintless consciousness, reflects the fact that his work proved"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"82 Sources of Contestationto be of interest in the first instance when it addressed topics that were already inten-sively contested in Tibet in any case. Tsongkhapa's interest in the Korean commen-tator, therefore, far from being a novelty, reflects his intense participation in thedominant scholastic discourse of his time.100Korea, Tibet, and the Early Medieval World SystemWhat conclusions are to be drawn from these and other, similar cases? In terms oftheir particulars, nothing I have discussed here is of convincingly deep importancefor Korean or Tibetan history as such. Korean Buddhism did make some impact infar-off Tibet, perhaps not a very great impact, but a discernible one nevertheless. Andsomething has been revealed to us of the dynamics of doctrinal transmission in Ti-bet, of the pattern of selective forgettings, reappropriations, and revaluations of thepast that this involved, and of the manner in which these reflect and contribute tolarger contests. Besides these discoveries, however, I am inclined to find some fur-ther interest here, not so much in virtue of what is revealed about Korea or Tibet inparticular, but rather because I believe that these data present us with some excellentexamples to ponder in relation to the dynamics of cultural transmission in earlymedieval Eurasia.It has by now been much argued that the emphasis in recent times on the writingof national history has obscured the study of international history and has rendereddifficult our prospects for understanding the world, in any particular period, as con-stituting a total system.101 So-called area studies—-though not so constrained as na-tional history—by dividing the world into more or less autonomously conceivedblocks nevertheless represent in some respects a still narrow perspective. After all,there have been all sorts of exchanges among different areas throughout human his-tory. An obvious objection to any proposed study of the \"world system\" as a correc-tive, however, is just that the system, so understood, is vastly too complex to permitprecise and careful investigation, except by dissecting it into smaller morsels, chieflyregions and states. \"World-systems theory,\" it is urged, may be laudable in its intent,but in practice it may too easily degenerate into platitudes and overgeneralizations.In just a few special areas—the study of the Mongol empire in the thirteenth centuryor the development of the great maritime empires after the fifteenth century mightbe among the better examples—something like a world-systems perspective is in-deed thrust upon us; but the very peculiarity of these cases precludes their invoca-tion as general models for historical study.It seems to me that there are good intuitions on both sides of the fence here. Therecan be no denying the necessity of special studies, focusing on precise and well-defined questions, that promise to clarify through their very particularity the largerproblems that the investigation of world systems seeks to illuminate. The careful studyof cultural transmission in early medieval Eurasia is a fertile ground for such inves-tigations, and relatively simple instances, such as those we have been consideringhere, offer not a bad point of departure for them. From a certain perspective at least,the mere fact that any relatively sophisticated learning whatsoever could have beentransmitted from Korea to Tibet during the eighth century is pretty remarkable.102What were some of the relevant, enabling conditions?"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"From Korea to Tibet 83Five factors appear at once to merit special consideration: the complex of whatwe would now think of in terms of ethnicity and nationality; language; religion; polity;and the system of trade and technology. The first I mention primarily to underscoreits relative unimportance in the period we are considering. No doubt the presence ina given, continuous geographical area, of people speaking a common tongue, shar-ing bonds of real or mythical ancestry, and with many common beliefs, would havefacilitated the rapid diffusion of new knowledge among the population concerned.Protonationalist sentiment must not be discounted as a possible element in medievalcultural transmission, but, unless we have good reason to posit this as an especiallyimportant factor in some particular case, we must take care not to project modernnationalistic conceptions too readily onto the past.103 In the third of our present ex-amples, for instance, we do not image that the WSnch'tik thought of his work as par-ticularly \"Korean\"; certainly his Tibetan readers did not, and by the same token, theydid not regard its identification as \"Chinese\" as precluding its potential relevance tothings \"Tibetan.\" Nevertheless, as R. Buswell has argued, the reception of Wonch'uk'swork in China was perhaps impeded by the fact that he was an outsider in Chineseeyes.104 It seems plausible to hold that medieval protonationalisms served more de-cisively as principles of exclusion than of inclusion and so were disclosed primarilywhere boundaries and prerogatives were threatened.105Language was surely a more significant factor in promoting cultural exchangethroughout the early medieval period than was nationality. And what was most im-portant for the transmission of knowledge, of course, was not national language, buttransnational language. Sanskrit and literary Chinese are perhaps the two most im-pressive, and the best known, of the transnational languages of Asia during the agein question,106 but we must recall here that Tibetan had by the late eighth centurycarved out a very wide niche for itself in Inner Asia. In Dunhuang, for instance, wefind that the local Chinese either were regularly employing Tibetan, or in some caseswere using the Tibetan script to write Chinese.107 The domains embraced by suchtransnational languages were, of course, realms in which the potential for culturaltransmission was very great, and this was heightened to a marked degree by the cre-ation of translation \"filters,\" rendering possible transmission between differing lin-guistic domains. The Tibetans and the Koreans did not generally employ the sametransnational language, but the center for the translation of Buddhist Chinese man-aged by Go Chodrup and his collaborators at Dunhuang, to mention the concreteinstance we know best,108 gave the Tibetans a receptor for signals emanating fromthe entire sinitic field, including Korean Buddhist circles.The possibility of communication, however, does not by itself motivate commu-nication. The three additional factors I have mentioned—religion, polity, and com-merce—may serve both to facilitate and to motivate the transmission and spread ofcultural knowledge. This much is, I think, clear, and in the present context I may bespared, I trust, the obligation to discuss these at length. The relationships betweenthe Tibetan and Tang states, and between the latter and the Korean kingdoms, thetraffic along the northern and southern Silk Roads, the pervasive spread of Bud-dhism—relatively nuanced accounts of these and much more would be required tofill out our tale. Let us just note, then, that religion, polity, and trade may often bethought to represent virtually autonomous systems themselves, which correspond atbest imperfectly and perhaps not at all to national and linguistic bounds. Our con-"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"84 Sources of Contestationception, therefore, is one of five overlapping subsystems that may be dynamicallyinteractive, and that together form a dense medium through which goods, techniques,and symbols can be transmitted over very great spaces throughout equally great pe-riods of time, despite whatever technological limitations may be thought to havehampered the flow of knowledge during the period concerned.Seen from such a perspective, the cases considered here stand as tokens—mark-ers of the specific patterns and processes informing an overarching system next towhich they in themselves appear trifling. It would be incorrect to allow this perspec-tive to undermine the value of investigating such matters, however. If we think ofour subject now as a science of cultural ecosystems, it should be at once clear thatthese cannot be studied at all, apart from the particular species that both constituteand thrive within a given system taken as a whole.Turning now to the history of Tibetan Buddhism in particular, we must under-stand that the three examples taken up in this chapter would have to be multiplied athousandfold to do justice to the full range of texts and teaching traditions that vari-ously became interwoven or opposed to one another in the fabric of Tibetan thought,from about the eighth through the thirteenth centuries. The few connections betweenTibet and Korea are good to think, so to speak, just because they are so much sim-pler than those between, say, Bengal, Nepal, Kashmir, or China, and Tibet overall.The full complexity of such connections, moreover, must be considered in relationto the full panoply of Tibetan individuals, lineages, and institutions that identifiedthemselves with, rejected, or ignored specific materials that became available throughthe varied processes of cultural transmission. Once more, our examples from Koreaillustrate this in a usefully austere manner. In the chapter that follows, however, itwill soon be apparent that in examining just a few aspects of Tibetan Buddhist thought,austerity must soon give way to reflection upon the intricate textures and the num-berless tensions that characterize the field overall."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"What Is \"TibetanScholasticism\"?Three Ways of Thought'uring the eleventh century, Tibetan Buddhism entered a period of renewed de-velopment and change. The collapse of the old Tibetan royal dynasty had taken place,according to traditional accounts, following the assassination of the anti-Buddhistmonarch Lang Darma, probably in 842,' and the ensuing power vacuum persistedfor a full four hundred years. Local lords vied for ascendency, and religious author-ity was no less contested than temporal power. As cultural life was gradually restored,Tibetan seekers and adventurers began to look outside Tibet for authoritative sourcesof Buddhist teaching, with the result that throughout the eleventh century we findTibetan translators and pilgrims journeying to India and Nepal in search of gurus,Scriptures, and esoteric lore. These developments were particularly prominent inWestern Tibet, where the great translator Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055) was patron-ized by the monarchs of the Guge kingdom. There, too, the saintly Indian scholarand adept Atisa (982-1054) was invited to teach, beginning in 1042. The careers ofthese two notable Buddhist monks mark the start of what Tibetan historians call the\"later spread of the teaching\" (bstan-pa phyi-dar), or the age of the \"new transla-tions\" (gsar-'gyur).The renewed Buddhist activity of the period, however, was not without its ten-sions. We have already suggested that competing lines of transmission accountedfor this in part. Yet there were many factors operating besides mere difference ofreligious lineage: regional and clan affiliations, relations with preexisting TibetanBuddhist traditions versus involvement in the new infusion of Indian teaching, ori-entations favoring monastic scholarship versus those emphasizing tantric yoga, com-petition for patronage—these were among the elements informing the developingscene. Indeed, difference of religious lineage can often be interpreted in terms of other,more fundamental oppositions.2The areas of contention in eleventh- and twelfth-century Tibetan Buddhism, how-ever, also fueled a creative dialogue that was characterized in some instances byimaginative and visionary syntheses and restatements of Buddhist teaching, and inothers by the effort to clarify that teaching through reasoned analysis, interpretation,and debate.

Though I regard this convention to begenerally an appropriate one, I think that our notion of just what counts as Tibetanscholasticism needs to be in some respects problematized, and to do this will be oneof my concerns here. We should begin, however, by first clarifying the applicationof the Western notion of scholasticism to things Tibetan.3Scholasticism, of course, primarily characterizes a dominant form of intellectualpractice in the Latin Catholic universities of the thirteenth through sixteenth centu-ries. Among the features that have been regarded as defining scholasticism, thosefrequently emphasized have included the effort to elaborate Catholic theology ac-cording to purely rational principles, the harmonization of theology with Aristote-lian philosophy that this effort involved, the emphasis in this context upon Aristotle'slogical writings, or Organon, and the primacy of scholia, commentarial glosses ontexts, as the written medium for the elaboration and expression of ideas. The word\"scholasticism,\" in fact, derives from \"scholium.\"It is not difficult to find here strong analogies with important aspects of intellec-tual practice in the Tibetan monastic colleges that developed from the late eleventhcentury onwards, where there was a marked concern to emphasize a highly rationalapproach to Buddhist doctrine, over and against one dominated exclusively by faith.4This required the careful study of Indian Buddhist philosophical writings, with theepistemological and logical works of Dharmaklrti (c. 600) supplying the major meth-odological organ.5 Finally, as in the Latin West, it was the commentary, in severalspecific forms, that emerged as the preeminent literary form of philosophical anddoctrinal writing. All of this, it seems, makes it entirely reasonable to extend the useof the word \"scholasticism\" to the non-Christian, non-Aristotelian context of Bud-dhist Tibet.Beyond these generalities, when we focus our attention upon some characteris-tically Aristotelian assumptions, it often appears that they have marked parallelsin the thought of Dharmaklrti and his Tibetan successors. Aristotle, for instance,tells us that \"[t]he first class of simple propositions is the simple affirmation, thenext, the simple denial. ..\" and that \"it is plain that every affirmation has an oppo-site denial, and similarly every denial an opposite affirmation.\"6 The essential roleof the binary opposition of affirmation and negation in the formation of humanthought and language has been almost universally presupposed in Western philo-sophical traditions, from those of the Lyceum down to the logical positivist andstructuralist movements of recent times. In the schools of Indian and Tibetan Bud-dhist thought, too, a similar opposition is often regarded as fundamental, as is sug-gested in a somewhat whimsical manner in this episode reported in the biographyof the famed nineteenth-century Tibetan Nyingmapa thinker, Mipham Gyamtsho(1846-1912):"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism \" ? 87When Mipham Rinpoche was looking over the Exposition of Valid Cognition [thePramdnavarttika of Dharmaklrti] he had a dream in which one who was Sakya Panditain essence appeared to him in the guise of a learned and accomplished master fromIndia, the tip of his nose slightly crooked, and said, \"What is there that you do notunderstand in the Exposition of Valid Cognition! It has two parts, refutation and proof.\"Then, he divided a volume of the Exposition of Valid Cognition into two parts andhanded it to Mipham, saying, \"Combine these two together!\" No sooner had he com-bined them than they turned into a sword, and all things that may be known appearedbefore him. Swinging that sword once, it appeared to Mipham that he cut through themall in an instant, without impediment. Consequently, he said, there was not a singleword in the Exposition of Valid Cognition which he did not understand.7The opposition of proof and refutation at the level of demonstrative reasoning struc-turally parallels that of affirmation and denial at the level of the proposition. Aristotle,who regards affirmation to have priority over negation similarly accords primacy toaffirmative demonstration,8 and in this respect his view differs somewhat from thatrepresented in Mipham's dream, where the two-edged sword is perfectly balanced.Whether this balance was maintained in practice, however, is perhaps anotherquestion.It is significant, too, that it was Sakya Pandita who appeared in Mipham's dream.In the development of the Tibetan scholastic traditions, the contributions of SakyaPandita Kiinga Gyeltshen (1182-1251) to the formation of ideals of scholarship andintellectual refinement were enormous, and his writings ranged over rhetoric and thelinguistic sciences, music and pedagogy, logic and Buddhist philosophy.9 In thischapter, we shall follow Mipham's lead and concern ourselves with aspects of SakyaPandita's contributions to Buddhist logic and epistemology, examining in particularhis arguments in connection with the theory of objects, including, in principle at least,books that turn into swords and other objects appearing in dreams.The remaining two figures to be considered here, Karma Pakshi (1204-1283) andDQlpopa Sherap Gyeltshen (1292-1361), are both renowned as great exponents ofyoga and tantric esotericism, in which the cultivation of imagination and vision ismost valued. Of course, it has sometimes followed that this emphasis on the vision-ary, on exploring what the great interpreter of Islamic mysticism, Henry Corbin, hasaptly termed the mundus imaginalis,10 has given rise to novelty that resists readyharmonization with more conservative traditions of scriptural exegesis. For this rea-son, one of the challenges for Tibet's religious visionaries was to elaborate doctrinalapologetics, indeed sometimes polemics, through which to express and to justify theirperspectives. It will become apparent here that the distinction between visionary andscholastic approaches to the interpretation of Buddhist teaching was therefore by nomeans an impermeable one, and to recognize this is one of the ways in which ourconception of Tibetan scholasticism needs to become more nuanced.In these examples it will be found too that each author's style of reflection corre-sponds in certain respects with his substantive concerns regarding the nature of Bud-dhist insight. Briefly, we may say that while Sakya Pandita regards a precise mas-tery of Indian Sanskrit learning to be the bedrock for the formation of the refinedBuddhist layman or monk, Karma Pakshi embraces an intuitive, but at the same timeskeptical, vision that countenances the possibility that direct insight may be catalyzedby any of a rich plurality of sources.

It wasduring the eleventh century that there was a renewal of interest here, and Tibetansbegan to study and to translate Indian logical treatises once again. An indigenousTibetan tradition of philosophical study and debate took root at Sangphu monastery(founded 1071 or 1073) in Central Tibet, which was to remain a singularly influen-tial scholastic center for the next three centuries and more.12 Sakya Pandita, as ascholar of Sanskrit who revised the Tibetan translation of one of the major treatisesof the Indian philosopher Dharmakirti,13 while no doubt indebted to the tradition ofSangphu in some respects, became sharply critical of it in others. His Treasury ofEpistemological Reason (Tshad-ma-rigs-gter), which was to be one of the most widelystudied philosophical works ever composed by a Tibetan author, delineates and de-fends the distinctive elements of his own reading of the Indian Buddhist epistemo-logical tradition, frequently opposing the school of Sangphu.14 In the elevenchapters of his treatise, he surveys a variety of questions pertaining to three centralcategories: the epistemological object (shes-bya'i yul), the subject that knows theobject—that is, the mind (shes-byed-kyi bio)—and the act of knowledge throughwhich the two are related (bio des yul rtogs-pa'i tshul).15 As it is my primary pur-pose here to indicate something of the style of argumentation Sakya Pandita employsin this context, my remarks will be limited to a survey of his treatment of the first ofthese topics, the object.For philosophers concerned with the fundamental problems of ontology, the prob-lems surrounding the inquiry into just what is, a special set of difficulties arises whenour intentional attitudes are considered. The objects of belief, thought, love, and hateneed not be concrete physical objects such as this chair, this desk, or this writingtablet. Neither must they be mental events per se, that is, the objects of thought neednot be themselves thoughts. Our minds seem to have access to a whole range of ob-jects that, if they exist at all, exist in no ordinary sense. Unhappy with the prospect ofontic superfecundity, the ontologist may wish to deny the existence of such objectsaltogether. The theory of objects and ontology, it would seem, part company here.Alexius Meinong has put the point succinctly: \"[T]he totality of what exists, includ-ing what has existed and will exist, is infinitely small in comparison with the totalityof the objects of knowledge.\"16Philosophical concepts related to questions of intentionality had begun to developin India at an early date, and, no later than the first centuries C.E., Buddhist thinkershad already argued that having an intentional object (salambanatvam) is the mark ofthe mental.17 Moreover, intentional objects as intentional objects were systematicallydistinguished from the external objects of the senses by means of the adoption of anappropriate technical terminology whose definitions were rigorously formulated.Sakya Pandita was thus the heir to an already ancient tradition of reflection on thenature and significance of intentional phenomena."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"90 Sources of ContestationIn both India and Tibet, certain of the philosophical schools of Buddhism soughtto maintain that some of the more anomalous objects among our ideas, as well assuch things as hallucinated objects, really do exist. Sakya Pandita summarizes theirviews as follows:The Tibetans say: \"If there do not exist both objective generalities (don-spyi), whichare the objects of conceptual error, and unreal appearances (med-pa gsal-snang), whichare the objects of nonconceptual [i.e., perceptual] error, then error becomes ground-less. Hence, there exist both [those two types of] apparent object. This is proven per-force of the self-presentations (rang-rig) in which both [those types of] erroneouscognition are apprehended.\"Moreover, the Sammitiya sect among the pious attendants (nyan-thos, sravaka)and others hold that both general terms (ming-spyi) and objective generalities, whoseforms are [respectively] words and marks, are concreta [to be classed among] thosefactors of being which are set apart; for they are set apart from [the classes of] physi-cal forms, minds, and mental events. Moreover, they hold that unreal appearances—even the objects of dreams—are so-called \"factors of being which are without the marksof sensible objects,\" and that these are concreta; and that dream-cognitions are bornfrom these.18It will be useful to consider in this context some of the definitions that have beenput forward by Tibetan Buddhist logicians in connection with the theory of objects:(Dl) Object (yul) = Def. That of which a mind can be aware.(D2) Knowable (shes-bya) — Def. Possibly an object.(D3) Intelligible (rig-bya) = Def. Possibly comprehended by an epistemic operation.(D4) Established ground (gzhi-grub) = Def. That upon which an epistemic opera-tion is directed.(D5) Certainly existent (yod-nges) = Def. Possibly within the purview of an epistemicoperation.19These five terms (D1-D5) are sometimes said to have the same reference. Our nextgroup of definitions distinguishes various types of object:(D6) Apparent object (snang-yul) = Def. That object which appears either as a rep-resentation, or directly without representation. (Note: The disjunctive form ofthis definition insures that it will be applicable in the contexts of both directrealism and representationalism.)(D7) Apprehended object (gzung-yul) = Def. The external object whose representa-tion is directly perceived by the apprehending subject.(D8) Object of intellection (zhen-yut) = Def. That of which a mind can be awarethrough an intellectual operation which in apprehending it renders it predomi-nant. (This may seem somewhat obscure. The object of intellection is usu-ally said to be an object indirectly referred to through a mediating concept,e.g., the fire referred to when, having seen smoke, one thinks, \"There's beena fire.\")(D9) Operational object ('jug-yul) = Def. That object which is the predominant [es-tablished] ground for an [epistemic] operation directed upon it by a correspond-ing subject."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism \"? 91It will not be necessary here to examine these definitions in detail. What is of in-terest in the present context is a problem that flows from the assumption that (Dl)-(D5) have the same reference. For then, by simple substitution, we can derive from(Dl) and (D5) the equation:Certainly existent - that of which a mind can be aware.Buddhist idealists were, of course, not in the least troubled by this: some of themwould have surely affirmed Berkeley's formula, esse est percipi. The idealists, inother words, would argue that the equivalency derived from (Dl) and (D5) followsfrom the fact that all that certainly exists and all of which a mind can be aware aremental acts. We should note, however, that (D7) may be taken to insist on there beingexternal objects—it is a definition advanced in connection with a realist ontology.To abandon (D7) might open the way for the proposed idealistic recasting of theremaining definitions; but to preserve (D7) while admitting, too, an apparent equa-tion of existence and object, we might be led to assert that there are actual existentscorresponding to all cognitive objects.Some such considerations as these must have motivated the various theories ofobjects advanced by Buddhist logicians. One approach to the resolution of the onto-logical problems encountered here was suggested by the eighth-century Indian Bud-dhist philosopher Dharmottara and was elaborated by Tibetan thinkers of the Sangphuschool in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.20 Their strategy was to elaborate a theoryof objects sufficiently rich to accommodate such things as objective generalities andapparitions as real, but peculiar, \"objects of apprehension,\" which they determinedto be of three kinds altogether: (1) the concrete particular object of apprehension(gzung-yul rang-mtshari), for instance, \"the object of apprehension of that sensorydirect perception that grasps a vase when a mind immediately perceives a vase\"; (2)the general characteristic as an object of apprehension (gzung-yul spyi-mtshari), forinstance, \"the object of apprehension of that thought that grasps the vase as a vase,that is, as an objective generality\"; and (3) the nonexistent, apparitional object ofapprehension (med-pa gsal-snang), for instance, \"the object of apprehension of thatsensory consciousness to which there appear hairlike lines, when hairlike lines areapparent to the erring sensory consciousness [as in the case of one with cataract].\"The use of the term \"object of apprehension\" in these contexts may suggest that thesethinkers were not originally concerned to elaborate an ontological theory, but rathersought merely to create a typology of epistemic objects. Nonetheless, even if thatwas the case, speaking in terms of there being such objects led to a certain hyposta-sis, the objects of types (2) and (3) coming to be regarded as real in just the samesense as those of type (1).Objective Generalities and Illusory ObjectsHow are we to understand all of this? The term \"objective generality\" (don-spyi) isdefined in a great many ways by later Tibetan thinkers. Recent interpreters of Ti-betan scholastic documents have sometimes used here the term \"generic image,\" butI think we should be on our guard lest we assimilate the concept to one of mentalimagery.21 Indeed, while some Tibetan writers do single out mental images as para-digm cases of what I here call \"objective generalities,\" others emphasize nonimagistic,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"92 Sources of Contestationdiscursive paradigms. For the purposes of the present discussion, the various scho-lastic definitions do not have to be considered in detail. To indicate the sense of \"ob-jective generality\" and the manner in which the objective generality provides a sourceof conceptual error, a useful analogy may be found in the empiricist notion of anidea. Consider David Hume's famous example of the golden mountain.The golden mountain, of course, does not actually exist, but nonetheless I can thinkof such a thing. How can this be? According to Hume, I combine my idea of goldwith that of mountain. Such ideas are of course not identical to the actual things outthere in the world, but neither does it make good sense to think of them as self-existentuniversals. Rather, they are somehow derived from my impressions of the things towhich they correspond. Similarly, the Buddhist logician's objective generalities areneither concrete particulars nor Platonic ideas (the existence of which Buddhist phi-losophers would in any case deny).22 And, in the present example, these queer ob-jects do not correspond to what is, but rather to what is not. Thus, they are a sourceof conceptual error. The question that Sakya Pandita will seek to answer, then, isthis: is there nevertheless some sense in which these peculiar objects themselves exist?To clarify further what is meant by \"objective generality,\" as well as the motivefor positing that there are such objects, let us consider a commonplace example.Suppose you enter a room and, your feet being tired, you want a chair. Then what isthe object of your desire? It is a chair to be sure, but can we say that it is this chair orthat chair? The curious thing is that whatever conclusions we might come to withregard to \"a chair,\" the thing that eventually satisfies your desire is this chair, even ifyou didn't have this chair in mind when at first you wanted a chair. To see just whatis at stake here, let us look more closely at some typical sentences:(1) Dechen wants a chair.(2) There is some particular chair that Dechen wants.23(3) There is chair number one, and chair number two, et cetera, and Dechen wantschair number one, or chair number two, et cetera.24Sentence 1 is illustrative of the kind of case with which we are here concerned,and sentences 2 and 3 represent attempts to express the sense of sentence 1 using thelogical device of existential quantification, without the entire sentence being gov-erned by a verb of intention. (That is, the statement of the chair's existence standsoutside of the statement of Dechen's want, and so only the chair, not its existence, iswhat is wanted.) Sentence 2 exemplifies what has become known as a failure ofexistential generalization. It says: there is something such that Dechen wants it. Thissuggests that Dechen had one particular chair in mind all along, which renders mys-terious the fact that her desire may be satisfied by a chair of which she had no previ-ous knowledge, or that she may desire something that does not exist at all. Sentence3, on the other hand, suggests that when Dechen wants a chair, she wants it-doesn't-matter-which-one of a very large number of things. And there is, of course, a sensein which this is true, although it seems unlikely that sentence 3 has succeeded incapturing just that sense. For supposing that the object of Dechen's want is, as is hereproposed, a disjunction, then is it merely a very long disjunction, or is it one thatincludes (in this case) all chairs? If it does include all chairs, how is it that Dechenknew to do this? But if it does not include all chairs, then why should we suppose"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism \" ? 93that it includes that chair which eventually satisfies Dechen's desire? The failure ofsentences 2 and 3 to represent sentence 1 adequately is symptomatic of the unusualontological status of \"a chair.\"Do we wish, then, to say that \"a chair\" really represents some sort of ideal object?This cannot be answered without further determining just what kind of ideal objectit might be. Certainly it is not a universal, that is, the property of being a chair. Evenif we assume here an extreme Platonist account of universals, we do not say that one'sdesire for a chair has for its object the ideal form, the universal Chair. Similarly, wemay speak of senses, or meanings, or immanent objects, but all alike leave paradoxi-cal the satisfaction of the desire by a concrete particular chair.The second type of intentional object with which Sakya Pandita will be concernedis the perceptual object that seems to exist but does not exist actually. The appari-tional city seen in the midst of a desert, Rama's vision of an illusory deer, imagesseen in dreams, various hallucinated sensations—these are just a few of the stockexamples. The ontological problems arising in connection with such objects presentcertain formal analogies to those that arise in connection with the indefinite descrip-tions just discussed. For example,(4) Rama sees the illusory deer,does not seem to say the same thing as(5) There exists something such that Rama sees it.25In this instance, however, a disjunctive translation along the lines of sentence 3 wouldbe too absurd even to consider, and we will ignore here the suggestion that really itis an abstract object that is seen, perhaps the disembodied principle of deerhood.Sakya Pandita's Approach to the ProblemBefore examining his arguments with respect to objects of these types, it will be usefulto consider some essential features of Sakya Pandita's ontology overall. It is clearthat he sought to subsume all things that are in the two great classes of mental andphysical substances. The former are discrete self-presentations, and the latter areconcrete particulars.26 All abstract objects are to be reduced to one or another of theseclasses or are held to be in some sense ontologically parasitic. Thus, Sakya Panditawas a sort of reist, though certainly not a pansomatist: that is to say, he believed thatonly real things exist, but that these need not only be bodies. On the contrary, hebelieved that a further reduction of the two great classes would result in the elimina-tion of the physical in favor of the mental, the world thus being ultimately consti-tuted only of self-presenting states.27 This idealist turn, however, need not concernus here; only his dualist ontology is relevant in the present context.Sakya Pandita advances two main arguments against the thesis that objectivegeneralities and apparitions actually exist. The first depends on the premise that wherea real object corresponds to a mental state representing that object, the cognition isveridical,28 as when one sees a pot under normal conditions. Assuming then, thatobjective generalities and apparitions are real, the mental states representing themare veridical. This conclusion, however, is counterexemplified by instances of cog-nitive error. Unless we wish to jettison the correspondence theory, our sole option isto reject the reality of objective generalities and apparitions."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"94 Sources of ContestationI think that with regard to apparitions the point being made here is clear enough.The assumption that the deer seen by Rama is a real deer is not consistent with theassumption that Rama is deluded in his perception of it. This is clearly part of whatwe mean when we speak of hallucinations. The force of the argument with respect toobjective generalities, however, is not quite so straightforward. Sakya Pandita him-self saw this and proceeded to elaborate a further line of argument in order to makehis case here.Let us consider someone who, entering a poorly lit chamber, takes a rope in thecorner to be a snake. The objective generality that he believes corresponds to hisperception is in this case \"a snake.\" And, certainly, his taking the rope to be a snakeis an example of an errant cognition. Consider:(6) Sonam takes the rope to be a snake.We will generally concur in rendering this as:(7) There is something that Sonam takes to be a snake.29But(8) There is something that Sonam takes the rope to be30seems at best ambiguous, and certainly false if \"there is something\" is taken to mean\"there really is a snake here.\"In his assumption that objective generalities have some role in cognitive error,then, Sakya Pandita was also pointing to a basic peculiarity of the objects of suchintentional states as \"taking,\" \"believing,\" \"appearing to,\" and so forth.Returning, for the moment, to the initial premise, which concerned the correspon-dence between veridical states and real objects, Sakya Pandita has a supposed ob-jector draw attention to the peculiar features of the situation exemplified by state-ment 7: there is a real object of this state of taking to be. Hence, it is not erroneous.31He responds that the objection proceeds from a false analysis of the situation. Thevisual perception of a variegated ropelike (or snakelike) object has been here con-founded with the taking of that object to be a snake. True enough, the visual percep-tion of a certain shape and arrangement of color is by no means erroneous, but that isnot what is here at issue. The error is Sonam's taking the real object to be a snake,when there is no such snake. Hence, the objective generality \"a snake\" is no real objectat all.Sakya Pandita's second argument is more difficult and involved than the first,and I am not entirely certain about the manner in which it is to be understood. Itsfundamental assumption seems to be that real objects belong to the domain ofintersubjectivity, in other words, there are no real private objects. If the apparitionor objective generality apprehended by Sonam were a real object, then others whoare appropriately situated might apprehend that very same object.32 But there is noreason to suppose that they do. Hence, these are not real objects. In other words,Rama's deer should be intersubjectively accessible in just the same sense as is anyordinary deer. And so, too, a snake, when Sonam is deluded with respect to therope.An objection that is raised here states in effect that although objective generali-ties and apparitions are real objects, they are not intersubjectively accessible just"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism \" ? 95because they are private (lit., \"bound to one's own mind,\" bdag-gi bio dang 'brel),like the insides of our bodies. The response given to this is that first of all the ex-ample is a bad one—our internal organs are possibly such that they are perceived byothers, for instance, if one is gravely wounded; and in any case we don't even per-ceive them ourselves under normal circumstances; hence, our innards are not simi-lar to supposed \"private objects.\" And, more importantly, there are simply no suchprivate objects. How is this to be established?Let us suppose that Dechen takes the rope in the corner to be a snake and thatSonam takes the very same rope to be a snake. Is there any sense to the notion thatthey are, or are not, referring to the same snake? On the assumption that they arereferring to real private objects, it would seem that they are taking one and the samerope to be utterly different things, for each is referring to a discrete private object.Thus, should they attempt to converse with one another, there will be no possibil-ity of understanding, for ex hypothesi they are speaking of utterly disparate thingsabout which they have no common knowledge.33 Then is communication betweenthem to be explained by supposing there to be a resemblance (rnam-pa 'dra-bd)between their nevertheless discrete objects? Sakya Pandita's response to this sug-gestion is that there can be no possibility whatsoever of establishing any such pos-ited resemblance: I know only the object before my own mind and have no meansby which I might compare it to the mysterious private object of which you speak,except by reference to what you say about it. But now we have begun to turn incircles. Only Dechen can in fact ever know what she takes the rope to be, and analo-gously for Sonam. One wonders: did Meinong and Russell ever puzzle about thesame unicorn?One question that it may be well to pose at this juncture is: how is it established thatSonam and Dechen both refer to the same thing when in fact they do refer to \"the verysame rope\"? The answer that I think Sakya Pandita wants to give here involves a ratherstrong principle of verification. That they are referring to the same thing is establishedonly when they pick out the same actual being in the world. But in that case the refer-ent is a concrete particular, not an objective generality. The conclusion we must drawis that there is no way to verify the identity of objective generalities; the rules of ourcommon discourse simply demand that we play it as if such an identity obtained. Thus,all reference to such things is wrapped up in error.34Sakya Pandita concludes from this that we must abandon altogether the attemptto conceive of objective generalities and apparitions as real objects. They are to bereduced, he maintains, to the self-presenting (rang-rig) states of the subject.35 Thusif Dechen takes something to be a snake, what we mean to say is that the taking ofsuch-and-such a phenomenon (for instance, a patch of color) to be a snake is self-presenting for Dechen. And analogously in the case of apparitions.Our consideration of Sakya Pandita's theory of objects points to a number of analo-gous developments in recent Western philosophy. The problem of objective gener-alities seems to be rather closely related to that which arises in connection with whatRussell calls \"indefinite descriptions\" or \"ambiguous objects.\" Some of his observa-tions on this subject would be appropriate here:[M]any logicians have been driven to the conclusion that there are unreal objects.. ..In such theories, it seems to me, there is a failure of that feeling for reality which ought"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"96 Sources of Contestationto be preserved even in the most abstract studies. ... In obedience to the feeling ofreality, we shall insist that, in the analysis of propositions, nothing \"unreal\" is to beadmitted. .. . \"A unicorn\" is an indefinite description which describes nothing. It isnot an indefinite description which describes something unreal.36Russell's argument is thus similar to Sakya Pandita's in its negative purpose, that is, tobanish unreal objects from our ontology. But the positive aspect of Russell's theory ofdescriptions is certainly without clear precedent in the material under consideration.The concept of the objective generality may also have some affinities to that ofthe common name—perhaps this is what is involved in Sakya Pandita's reference tothe doctrine of general terms. If so, I suspect that he would concur here with ReinhardtGrossmann:What does it mean to name something commonly? . .. there is no sensible answer tothis question. The notion of a common name is inherently confused. I, for one, cannotmake sense of the assertion that, say, 'fish' names every single fish, but does not nameeither this or that particular fish, or the property of being a fish, or the class of all fish.37Sakya Pandita's suspicions with respect to supposed private objects are perhapsin some respects also reminiscent of views advanced by Wittgenstein and his dis-ciples. On what grounds do we say that two people have the same idea, when thatidea refers to nothing real? Some philosophers, concurring with Meinong, would insistthat this puzzle forces us to acknowledge that there must be some types of nonrealobject. According to Meinong:[I]n this case there exist two different ideas since there occur two mental acts of pre-sentation. But these two ideas are equal... when we say that two persons have thesame idea, we can only mean that there occur two ideas of the same entity.38Sakya Pandita would, of course, dissent. He affirms, I believe, something very muchlike Quine' s maxim: \"No entity without identity.\" In the absence of specifiable identityconditions for the entities conceived of by two persons who ponder the golden moun-tain, we cannot affirm that they conceive of the same thing at all.Sakya Pandita's theory of objects was not, however, purely negative. He assertedpositively that nonreal objects are ontologically dependent upon the self-presentingstates of the subject. It seems to me that here his theory has some similarities withthe early phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, that of the Logical Investigations:[T]he object is aimed at, which signifies that the act of aiming at it is an experience;but the object is still only presumed and, in truth, is nothing. ... I represent the godJupiter, which is to say that I have a certain experience of representation, which in myconsciousness is realized as the representation-of-the-god-Jupiter.... But if, in addi-tion, the object aimed at exists, the situation has not necessarily changed from thephenomenological point of view. For consciousness of what is given is essentiallythe same thing, whether the object represented exists, or if it is imagined and evenperhaps absurd.39Before leaving this topic, it may be well to close by asking what all of this has todo with Buddhism. Some Tibetan authorities perhaps believed that mastery of theDignaga-Dharmaklrti system of logic and epistemology was to be counted amongthe necessary conditions for progress towards the Buddhist enlightenment, for en-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism \" ? 97lightenment, being perfect knowledge, was to be engendered by flawless reason thatfrees itself from all error. Sakya Pandita's views about this have been disputed andare less than entirely clear-cut. Though he may have regarded logic and epistemol-ogy, like the other \"outer\" sciences,40 to have no direct relationship with the finalends of the Buddhist path, he did insist that the ability to reason and to refute whatwas unreasonable should contribute to one's ability to understand and to interpretrightly the Buddha's teaching.41 And this conceptual clarity, of course, may wellconduce to spiritual advancement, if what is rightly understood is practically applied.It will be seen in what follows, however, that the relationship between natural rea-son and the teaching's highest insights poses a problem that runs deep within theTibetan tradition.Karma Pakshi's DoubtsThe Magus KarmapaIn 1978, two rare volumes attributed to the third Karmapa hierarch, Rangjung Dorje(1284-1339), and entitled Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas-kyi skor (The Limitless OceanCycle) were published in India. The title, it seemed to me at the time, was suggestiveof two famous verses from the Bhadracaripranidhanaraja (The Regal Aspiration ofFine Conduct), perhaps the most widely known prayer in Tibet:Purifying the ocean of fields,Liberating the ocean of beings,Beholding the ocean of dharmas,Immersed in the ocean of gnosis,Refining the ocean of conduct,Perfecting the ocean of prayer,Worshiping the ocean of Buddhas,May I practice for an ocean of aeons, never fatigued.42Through the biographical accounts of the third Karmapa, it was known that he hadcomposed a treatise concerning the cosmology of the Avatamsakasutra,43 the col-lection of sutras from which the Re gal Aspiration is drawn. Could this Limitless OceanCycle be Rangjung Dorje's work on the Avatamsakal Obtaining a copy, I plungedinto the text and, as I soon discovered, into an ocean of philological difficulty.The Limitless Ocean Cycle is a collection of treatises that taken together presentan exceedingly thorough survey of the nine vehicles (theg-pa, Skt. yana) of theNyingmapa school (see p. 16, table 1). The author's perspective, though, is that ofone who has very close ties to the new translation schools that arose after the tenthcentury, the Kagyiipa in particular. The published manuscript is incomplete—myguess is that it contains about half of the original content—but this much is suffi-cient to provide us with some understanding of the author's general scheme.44 Asthat author, according to the colophons of individual texts making up the cycle, styleshimself Karmapa Rangjung Dorje, both the publisher and the U.S. Library of Con-gress naturally identified him with the third Karmapa hierarch.45Here, however, as I read through the Limitless Ocean Cycle, something struckme as being amiss: my previous reading of Rangjung Dorje's work had revealed an"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"98 Sources of Contestationexacting thinker and precise stylist, one who was fascinated with the minutiae of as-tronomical calculations and yogic physiology, and who sought to express these inthe clearest manner possible. His concern for exactitude was to be found also in hiscontemplative works.46 The author of the Limitless Ocean Cycle, however, was clearlya visionary who liked to work in great, broad strokes, who adhered to a well-definedarchitechtonic, to be sure, but still ventured to make rambling digressions or to con-jure up strange associations of ideas in the course of advancing an arcane, yet lumi-nous, doctrine. That doctrine itself is one in which the teachings of all the nine ve-hicles, of the tantras old and new, and of even the non-Buddhist \"extremists\" (Skt.tirthika, Tib. mu-stegs-pd), come crashing together in the realization of the GreatPerfection (Rdzogs-pa-chen-po). In short, my initial impression of the author of theLimitless Ocean Cycle was that he differed greatly in intellectual temperament fromRangjung Dorje, hardly less than did, say, Eckhart from Aquinas. Nonetheless, inthe face of the colophonic data and uncertain of the value of my general impressions,I hesitated to conclude that the Limitless Ocean Cycle was not the work of the thirdKarmapa.It was quite by accident that several months after beginning to study the LimitlessOcean Cycle I came across the following passage, which laid bare the solution to theentire problem. It comes from the Ri-chos mtshams-kyi zhal-gdams (Precepts onSolitary Retreat) by the seventeenth-century yogin Karma Chakme. Significantly,as we shall see, it is found in the chapter of that work that treats the teaching of thetantras of the anuyoga-class:[What I have set forth here] is merely the kernel, based on my own experience andeasily understood. It may be elucidated at length by regarding both the great text ofthe Gdams-ngag rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas (Limitless Ocean of Instructions)47 and theZab-chos rgya-mtsho mtha '-yas (Limitless Ocean of Profound Doctrines),48 which in-clude numberless texts, fundamental and ancillary, these being found in the CollectedWorks (Bka'-'bum) of the great siddha Karma Pakshi (1204-1283).49Accepting Karma Chakme's attribution as a working hypothesis, it seemed es-sential to discover why it was that the colophons of the Limitless Ocean Cycle weresigned \"Rangjung Dorje.\" The Autobiographical Writings of the Second Karma-paKarma Pakshi, published in India at the same time as the Limitless Ocean Cycle (andby the same publisher!), provided an answer on the first folio:This is the unborn, primordially pure Lion's roar proclaimed by one who isIn the future to be emanated by Simhanada,In the past Diisum Khyenpa [the first Karmapa hierarch] himself,At present Rangjung Dorje. .. .50And again, some verses further on:I am Rangjung Dorje,The vajra-king, one of great might. ...\"Rangjung Dorje\" occurs frequently throughout the Autobiographical Writings asthe name whereby the author refers to himself,51 though he also uses \"Dharmasiddhi\"on occasion,52 and, in some of the episodes connected with the Mongol court, the"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism\"? 99famous title \"Karma Pakshi.\"53 In tales of past lives, \"Sempa Rangjung Dorje\" is metwith frequently, which may lead us to conclude that this is understood to be the propername of the bodhisattva who in Tibet is manifest as the Karmapa.54 It is in the lightof all this that an episode in the life of the third Karmapa, which is reported by PawoTsuklaktrhenga, may be comprehended: the master Orgyenpa (1230-1309), havingjust identified the youth who would be the third Karmapa as Karma Pakshi's rein-carnation declares, \"As my guru's esoteric name (gsang-mtshari) was Rangjung Dorje,I will name you just that.\" And so he names him.55Karma Pakshi, known as the rebirth of Karmapa Diisum Khyenpa (1110-1193),one of the four preeminent disciples of Gampopa (1079-1153), is sometimes regardedas the first representative of the most distinctive of Tibetan hierarchical institutions,the identification of a future hierarch as the rebirth, or \"emanational embodiment\"(sprul-sku), of his deceased predecessor. Certainly, with Orgyenpa's recognition ofhis successor, this began to emerge as a primary means of succession within Tibetanreligious institutions.56 The successive Karmapas, who, like the later Dalai Lamas,are thought to be emanations of Tibet's patron bodhisattva, Avalokitesvara, playeda major role in Tibetan religious, and sometimes also political, life down to the timeof the line's recent representative, Karmapa XVI Rangjung Rikpei Dorje (1927-1981). Indeed, the latter's disputed succession demonstrates just how important thisoffice continues to be for Tibetan Buddhists.57Karma Pakshi hailed from far eastern Tibet and during his youth became the pupilof Diisum Khyenpa's illustrious grand-disciple, Pomdrakpa (1170-1249), who ini-tiated him into the Kagyiipa system of yoga and meditation. He later was ordainedand continued his studies under one of the leading masters of the Nyingmapa school,Jampabum (1179-1252), the third abbot of Kathok monastery in what is today west-ern Sichuan.58 Kathok had its own distinctive tradition of doctrinal learning, reach-ing back to the Nyingmapa lineages that had been active during the period betweenthe fall of the old dynasty and the eleventh-century revival.59 The hallmarks of thesystem were the analysis of the entire range of Buddhist teaching in terms of nineprogressive approaches to the highest enlightenment called vehicles (theg-pa, yana),60and a special emphasis on the three highest vehicles, those of esoteric tantras, par-ticularly as these were embodied in the teachings of the Guhyagarbhatantra (TheTantra of the Secret Nucleus), the Mdo dgongs-pa 'dus-pa (The Sutra GatheringAll Intentions), and the highest contemplative teachings of the Nyingmapa, thoseof the Great Perfection (Rdzogs-pa-chen-po).61 Karma Pakshi's Limitless OceanCycle is in most respects, in fact, an elaborate systematization of the Kathok tradi-tion of teaching.In 1255/56, responding to the invitation of the Mongol ruler Mongke Khan, KarmaPakshi traveled to Sira-ordos (the Mongol imperial camp) to participate in a religiousconclave sponsored by the Khan. Though he participated in debates with the adher-ents of other religions, primarily Taoists but probably also Confucianists andNestorianChristians, he came to be a strong proponent of the Mongol imperial policy of reli-gious tolerance and praised the Khans for this at several points in his autobiogra-phy.62 With the definitive ascension of the leaders of the Sakyapa school to the pre-dominant position in Mongol-Tibetan affairs, Karma Pakshi was for awhile out offavor, and his relations with Khubilai Khan (1215-1294), the Mongol founder of the"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"100 Sources of ContestationYuan dynasty in China, seem to have undergone considerable fluctuation. Nonethe-less, he adopted and is primarily remembered by the epithet bestowed on him at theMongol court: Karma Pakshi, \"the magus Karmapa.\"63Karma Pakshi's autobiography reveals that, like many leading Tibetan Buddhistmasters, he was prone throughout much of his life to intense visionary experiences,and these formed a major part of his inspiration as a doctrinal author. His writings,no complete set of which is known to be available at the present time, were primarilydevoted to esotericism but included at least one treatise on Buddhist logic and epis-temology, now lost, and several other opuscules of philosophical interest.64 He re-garded all of his writings as disclosing a unified, comprehensive vision of Buddhistteaching and practice, which is embodied in the Limitless Ocean Cycle. Accordingto his own testimony, the text to be discussed in the following section was central tohis thought, and this reveals a distinctively skeptical frame of mind.That the Rangjung Dorje of the Autobiographical Writings is definitely none otherthan the Rangjung Dorje of the Limitless Ocean Cycle is confirmed both by directreferences to the Limitless Ocean Cycle within the Autobiographical Writings andby the stylistic and doctrinal similarities between the two. Among the direct refer-ences to the Limitless Ocean Cycle, we find:Having journeyed to the land called \"Ke-cu\" in China, I remained there for eightmonths. At that time all of China arose shimmeringly, appearing as the mandalas ofManjuvajra and Cakrasamvara and their assembled deities. I then heard all sounds andvoices as the doctrinal wheels of the various vehicles, and of the outer and inner philo-sophical systems, and I realized them. Thereupon, most of the Limitless Ocean of theTeaching (Bstan-pa rgya-mtsho mtha'- yas), the doctrinal wheel of the nine vehicles,became clear, and I composed it at length.65Again, he tells us:I, the renowned Karmapa, realizing, obtaining the great transmission of myriad trans-mitted doctrines and so having perfected and analyzed, without adulteration and inparticular, the words and the meanings of the trio of nonrealization, mistaken realiza-tion, and partial realization, have discussed the Limitless Ocean of the Teaching, whichaccords with the intention of the Buddhas, with the host of dakas, dakinls, bodhisattvas,sravakas, and pratyekabuddhas, and, in accord with all the philosophical systems, havediscovered and realized within myself the Buddha, [who is endowed with] fivefoldembodiment.66Finally, we may remark that in one passage he refers to his Autobiographical Writ-ings as the background histories (gleng-gzhi) for the Bstan-pa rgya-mtsho mtha '-yas (The Limitless Ocean of the Teaching) and the Ye-shes rgya-mtsho mtha'- yas(The Limitless Ocean of Gnosis).67Let us note, too, that neither Pawo Tsuklaktrhenga, nor even the recent MendongTshampa Rinpoche (writing in 1897), was in the least uncertain as to the use of thename Rangjung Dorje, or as to the provenance of the Limitless Ocean Cycle. I haveuncovered, in fact, no evidence whatever for there having been any confusion aboutthese matters within the tradition itself prior to our own generation. Thus the mis-taken identification of the author of the Limitless Ocean Cycle must be regarded as acontemporary, and not as a traditional, misattribution.68"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism\" ? 101Skepticism and BreakthroughWhat of the actual teaching of the Limitless Ocean Cycle! It may be best to begin bymaking a somewhat rough and subjective observation: the Limitless Ocean Cycle isunusual among the Tibetan encyclopedic works that have become available in thatit aims not to delimit and then to dissect the knowable, but rather to challenge usthroughout with its irreducible, infinite grandeur. This is not to say that the notionthat knowledge is without limits is a particularly novel one for Tibetan Buddhistscholasticism; the point here is that while the scholastic pedagogy prefers to treatcarefully circumscribed bodies of learning, this is not entirely true of Karma Pakshi.He wishes, instead, to confront us at every turn with what he terms \"the trio ofnonrealization, mistaken realization, and partial realization\" (ma-rtogs log-nogsphyogs-rtogs gsum) and thereby to make of ignorance and doubt catalysts for theemergence of an enlightened awareness.Let us attempt to see just how this is evidenced within the text itself. One of theopuscules making up the Limitless Ocean Cycle is a peculiar work called the 'Dod-pa rgya-mtsho mtha '-yas (The Limitless Ocean of Tenets).69 Its relation to the entirecycle is known to us in very general terms through references to it found in othersections of the Limitless Ocean Cycle itself, for instance:The Gdams-ngag rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas (The Limitless Ocean of Instructions), theZhus-lan rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas (The Limitless Ocean of Dialogue),70 and the 'Dod-pa rgya-mtsho mtha '-yas (The Limitless Ocean of Tenets) are all-embracing: the ex-position of these does not belong to any sequence [that is to say, they do not have setpositions within the sequence of the nine yanas].. .. They are the general frameworkfor the whole. .. .71In what way does the Limitless Ocean of Tenets \"embrace everything\"? What kindof \"general framework\" does it provide? Turning to the text, we find a strange list ofconflicting doctrines, dozens of them, with a minimum of explanation and analysis,for instance:It is held that samsara has a beginning and end, and it is held that samsara is withoutbeginning or end. It is held that minds are of identical nature throughout all samsaraand nirvana, and it is held that all minds are of differing natures. It is held that sen-tient beings are newly produced, and it is held that sentient beings are not newly pro-duced.72 It is held that in understanding and practicing by means of various reason-ings, one definitively establishes [the doctrine] by reasoning, and it is held that onedefinitively establishes it [without relying on natural reason] through the transmittedprecepts spoken by all the buddhas, and it is held that the trio of Buddha, doctrine,and teaching has not been experienced as emerging and thus is not. It is held that thereis no karma, and it is held that there is karma and the ripening of karma. It is held thatwhen offspring are born to the males and females of all creatures, they are generatedby body [alone], and [it is held] that they are generated by both body and mind.

It is held thatthere is a connection between both body and mind, and it is held that there is no con-nection between body and mind. It is held that there is ultimate truth, and it is heldthat there is the truth of superficial appearance. It is held that the eight aggregates ofconsciousness have objects, it is held that they are subjects, and it is held that theyhave neither object, nor causal conditions.

It is held that thereis a connection between all the particulars of samsara and nirvana and the names bywhich they are designated, and it is held that there is no connection between all theparticulars of samsara and nirvana and the names by which they are designated. Itis held that [for some types of sentient creatures] fire relieves the affliction of thirst,and it is held that water makes [those creatures] warm and thirsty.

It is held that there is a connection between cloudand sky, and it is held that there is no connection between cloud and sky. It is heldthat there is no connection between day and night, and it is held that there is a con-nection between day and night. It is held that there is a connection between this birthand the next, and it is held that there is no connection between this birth and thenext, and it is held that there is no birth at all after this one. It is held that there is aconnection between fire and smoke, and it is held that there is no connection be-tween fire and smoke. It is held that there are connections among the three poisons[stupidity, hatred, passion], and it is held that there is no connection among the threepoisons. It is held that there is a connection between both happiness and suffering,and it is held that there is no connection between both happiness and suffering. Itis held that there is a connection between both the locus of a real property andreality per se, and it is held that there is no connection between the locus of a realproperty and reality per se. Please know, by means of the two types of epistemicauthority [perception and inference], the inconceivable extent to which appearancesof there being connections are imputed where there are no connections. One whocomprehends everything [in this way] is the king of all-knowers and omniscientones!74Occasionally, however, the purpose of this catalogue is made explicit and clear:It says in the transmission of the Prajnapammita (The Perfection of Discernment):Tenets are like the edge of a sword. Tenets are like a poisonous plant. Tenetsare like a flaming pit. Tenets are like the [poisonous] kimpaka fruit. Tenetsare like spittle. Tenets are like an impure container. Tenets are reviled by all.75Therefore, whatever tenets—whether good, bad, or mediocre—you might harbor arethe causes of good, bad, or mediocre [conditions of] samsara. They are devoid of thelife-force of nirvana. Therefore, whatever tenets, hankerings, or particular philosophical"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism\"? 103positions you hold, they cause you to be buddhaless and make you meet with samsara.You should know the masses of tenets, [each one] in particular.In all the outer and inner philosophical systems there are various tenets. They ap-pear all mixed together. The wise appear to have tenets; the ignorant appear to havetenets, too. Because tenets are all-pervading, I pray that the wise analyze them. It isheld that Buddhahood is attained from having tenets; it is maintained that Buddha-hood is attained from not having tenets; and it is maintained that Buddhahood is at-tained from removing both extremes. I pray that you direct your attention to each andevery such tenet in turn.... It is held that Buddhahood is attained from gradually tra-versing the stages and paths; and it is held that Buddhahood is attained naturally, notperforming the slightest virtue, not repenting of the slightest sin. The number of te-nets is vast; because thought cannot embrace [all] tenets, do you not harbor doubts asto what is genuine?76If you do not doubt, Karma Pakshi seems now to be telling us, you very well oughtto do so. Why so?The genuinely skeptical portion of the argument resembles the tenth mode of clas-sical skepticism in the West, according to which the conflict of views on a particulartopic leads us to withhold judgement when we find that there is no uncontested cri-terion that will resolve the conflict in question.77 Thus, Karma Pakshi's procedureconsists of juxtaposing opinions on diverse topics, such as the limits of the round ofrebirth (samsara), the nature of karma, the creation of sentient beings, the relation-ship between reason and faith, and so on. The insights of the great meditative tradi-tions are to be realized in a breakthrough rendered possible, in part, by this ground-clearing operation, but their achievement is not, in any straightforward sense, the resultof the dialectical procedure alone. Thus he continues:You must realize the perseity of the Buddha. You must realize the perseity of theDharma and Samgha. You must realize the perseity of the deity and of the mantra....There is a limitless ocean of tenets pertaining to the dharmas of samsara and nirvanaand to the particular philosophical systems. You must realize it to be neither conjoinedwith, nor separate from, the limitless ocean of realization, which is free from all ac-ceptance and rejection, and which is spontaneously present gnosis.78Moreover:Though there appear all the dharmas of samsara and nirvana, various philosophical sys-tems, and the inconceivably many adherences, the root of all of them is the essentialabiding nature of actual entities (dngos-po gshis-kyi gnas-lugs), naturally and sponta-neously present, the expanse of reality (chos-kyi dbyings) that is limitlessly extensiveand without measure. Without limit and center it can be labeled neither \"Buddha\" nor\"sentient being.\" All that appear, the dharmas of samsara and nirvana, abiding naturallyand essentially, cannot by any means be abandoned or acquired through effort and prac-tice. Such is the essential abiding nature of the actuality of mind. .. ,79Thus the truly significant foundation we seek, which can only be known intuitively,is the enlightenment of the Great Seal (Mahamudra) and Great Perfection traditionsand all that this entails. The Limitless Ocean of Tenets embraces the entire content ofthe Limitless Ocean Cycle by calling upon us to question any and all doctrines to"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"104 Sources of Contestationwhich we might adhere before we have gained that realization. Like some of theskeptical fideist philosophers and theologians of seventeenth-century Europe,80 KarmaPakshi maintains that conflict among differing philosophical and religious doctrinesmust lead us to doubt and a suspension of judgment. In this case, however, that sus-pension provides an opening not for Christian faith, but precisely for a letting go ofthe limiting views and opinions that obstruct our realization of the liberating visionof the Buddhist enlightenment, as taught in the Great Seal and Great Perfectionmeditational precepts of the Kagyiipa and Nyingmapa traditions. If, then, I am read-ing Karma Pakshi correctly, doubt provides us with a pathway leading to realization,so that any tenet belonging to the trio of nonrealization, mistaken realization, or par-tial realization may legitimately become a point of departure for the pursuit of awak-ening. This approach to doctrine may be exemplified by Karma Pakshi's distinctiveattitude towards other religions. While his views here are difficult to interpret pre-cisely, they do appear to confirm my basic thesis. To see this we may turn to theBstan-pa rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas (The Limitless Ocean of the Teaching), where, aftermaking some standard assaults on the non-Buddhist mu-tek-pa (mu-stegs-pa, firthika,\"extremist\") positions, he continues:Birth in the mu-tek-pa family has not arisen without cause. Because the causes [forachieving circumstances favorable to enlightenment] are amassed, the mu-tek-pa pathstend towards the path, and their philosophical systems bring about a change of mind.One must not, then, disparage the mu-tek-pas. Again, they magnify the teaching, forthe philosophical systems of mu-tek-pa teachers are said to be miraculous displays ofthe Conqueror. .. . Mu is the expanse itself, and tek is gnosis.81It will be worthwhile now to inquire briefly into the sources of Karma Pakshi'sinspiration. In the foregoing discussion we have several times met with a phrasethat occurs often in the Autobiographical Writings, that is, the \"trio of non-realization, mistaken realization, and partial realization.\" It seems in fact tobe drawn from a verse that we find repeated on numerous occasions through-out the Limitless Ocean Cycle, and that paraphrases a verse from the thirteenthchapter of the Guhyagarbhatantra (The Tantra of the Secret Nucleus), the fore-most of the Nyingmapa tantras of the mahayoga class.82 The cryptic verse in ques-tion reads:Intention, discipline, and esotericism,Nonrealization and mistaken realization,Partial realization and not realizing what is genuineGive rise to doubts about this absolute!83According to the traditional exegesis of the Secret Nucleus, each of the terms inthe first three lines refers specifically to one or another of the philosophical systems,or vehicles, that is ranked below the mahayoga.84 Before Karma Pakshi's age,the pandita Rongzom Choki Zangpo (eleventh century), in commenting uponPadmasambhava's Man-ngag Ita-ba'i phreng-ba (The Garland of Views: An Eso-teric Precept), had already utilized this passage as the framework for his analysis ofthe master's presentation of the various philosophical and spiritual systems.85 Now,Karma Pakshi tells us:"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism\"? 105The words and meanings [of the verse just cited] have been amply set forth in verse inthe Limitless Ocean of the Teaching. . . ,86As that work never attempts, in the available texts, a word-by-word exposition ofthe key verse, it is plausible to conclude that Karma Pakshi means here that the Lim-itless Ocean of the Teaching is in its entirety a revelation of the full implications ofthe one four-line mnemonic. But if this mnemonic provides some insight into KarmaPakshi's general approach as illustrated earlier with reference to the \"extremist\" mu-tek-pa, that is, his tendency to move from exposition through doubt to the triumphantassertion of the Great Perfection, still it does not reveal the source of his overallarchitechtonic. This, however, may be reasonably identified with the nine-yana sys-tem of the Nyingmapa, above all as it is elaborated in connection with the exegesisof the anuyoga-tantras.87 Karma Pakshi's extensive treatment of the anuyoga wouldin fact be noted by the Nyingmapa polemicist Sokdokpa Lodro Gyeltshen (b. 1552),88and Karma Pakshi himself unequivocally states his opinion concerning the crucialrole of the anuyoga as follows:Because the anuyoga is the general transmission of all the vehicles, all vehicles andphilosophical systems are distinguished and established within the anuyoga.... Knowthat the anuyoga is like a vast ocean, in comparison with which all the other vehiclesand philosophical systems are like rivers and streams. All vehicles are subsumed inthe anuyoga. The utterly perfect fruit of anuyoga is the Great Perfection. . . .89We may say summarily that Karma Pakshi's view of the general architecture ofthe path is derived from the Mdo dgongs-pa 'dus-pa (The Sutra Gathering All Inten-tions) and other fundamental works of the anuyoga, that his treatment of specificsystems seems to be grounded in the teachings of the Secret Nucleus and its exegeti-cal tradition, belonging to the mahayoga, and that the goal to which he seeks to guideus is that of the Great Perfection (Rdzogs-pa-chen-po, or atiyoga). In the LimitlessOcean Cycle, then, we have perhaps the grandest attempt, prior to the age of thatcrown jewel of Tibetan visionaries, Longchen Ramjampa (1308-1363; see chapter9), to elaborate a syncretic approach to the Buddhist traditions of Tibet, one basedupon the peculiar traditions of the Nyingmapa school.90What of Karma Pakshi's Kagyiipa affiliations? Often he refers to himself as onewho is blessed by the lineage of Naropa,91 Marpa's Indian teacher and the fountain-head of the Kagyiipa tradition; and the tantric transmissions of the new translationschools are considered at length in connection with the mahayoga sections of theLimitless Ocean Cycle?2 In the Autobiographical Writings, he insists, at one point,that the Great Perfection and the Great Seal differ only in name,93 which no doubtaccounts for Karma Chakme' s references to Karma Pakshi as a precursor of Chakme' sown synthetic teaching of the \"coalescence of Great Seal and Great Perfection\"(phyag-rdzogs zung- 'jug).94 Still, the thrust of the Limitless Ocean Cycle is withoutdoubt Nyingmapa, a fact which may explain its extreme rarity even in Karma Kagyiipacircles. While Karma Pakshi certainly anticipates much of the later Kagyiipa/Nyingmapa eclecticism that in time came to pervade the various Kagyiipa lineages,95his actual impact on the later masters of these schools remains unclear.96How are we to assess Karma Pakshi's contributions? What is certainly most dis-tinctive about his thought is the robust skepticism we have seen presented in the Limit-"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"106 Sources of Contestationless Ocean of Tenets. Though skeptical arguments of many kinds were well knownto Tibetan scholars, Karma Pakshi appears to have given much freer rein to this ten-dency than we find elsewhere, except perhaps in some of the tantras of the GreatPerfection teaching, which must be counted among his major sources of inspiration.In his exceptional deployment of skeptical argument, he may perhaps be describedin certain respects as an antischolastic. Nevertheless, I am inclined to hold that hisdoubts were less unusual than his manner of expressing them; for, though the con-templative traditions frequently employed informal skeptical arguments in connec-tion with meditational training, their philosophical articulation tended to be cautiouslyrestrained.97 One result was that, although the tension between positive reason andskeptical doubt did impart a measure of impetus to the development of Tibetan Bud-dhist intellectual traditions, this tension seldom emerged so forcefully as it did in thewritings of the second Karmapa. The dilemmas posed by the presence of strong skep-tical undercurrents within the tradition were resolved in part, as we shall see empha-sized in turning now to Dolpopa, by ensuring that one's reflections were securelyanchored in the interpretation of scripture.Dolpopa on the Age of PerfectionReason and skepticism, which turns reason back against itself, though perhaps some-times regarded as describing a binary opposition in the field of thought, by no meansdemarcate the full range of thought's varied ways. In Tibetan Buddhist writing,poetic and hermeneutical modes of reflection are also very well represented. The his-torical theories of Dolpopa offer a particularly remarkable example of hermeneuti-cal reflection.98To begin to place Dolpopa in the Tibetan world of the fourteenth century, and tounderstand his own world-making activity, which is reflected in his view of Bud-dhist history, we need to examine briefly some aspects of his life.99 The biographyincluded in the first volume of Dolpopa's collected works begins, indeed, with a seriesof accounts of his past lives, making it one of the documents of special interest forthe study of the emergence of the characteristically Tibetan institution of emanationalhierarchy (sprul-sku).100 Like Karma Pakshi, Dolpopa regarded himself as the presentinstantiation of a being whose personal history spanned aeons. And again like theKarmapa, and several other major emanational lines in Tibet, including the DalaiLamas, Dolpopa identified himself with Tibet's patron bodhisattva, Avalokitesvara,and his Tibetan emanation in the form of King Songtsen Gampo. He thus was alignedwith a cult that had already given cosmological meaning to Tibet in its relation withthe Buddhist universe (see chapter 8). Dolpopa was further considered to have beenthe great Kagyiipa master Drigung Kyopa Jiktensumgon (1143-1217) in his preced-ing lifetime,101 and like that master he was also identified with the Indian philosopherNagarjuna. Moreover, in the twenty-seventh of the rebirths listed, he had been KalklPundarlka, the \"king of the clans\" (rigs-ldari) of the kingdom of Shambhala, the guardianrealm of Kalacakra, the Wheel of Time.102 This will be seen below to be a detail ofspecial significance. The biography of Dolpopa includes tales of thirty-two lifetimesin all, matching the number of the Buddha's major marks, and so representing the cul-mination of Dolpopa's course in the attainment of perfect buddhahood."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism\"? 107In its general features, Dolpopa's life story is not at all atypical; its pattern is en-tirely of a piece with the biographies of other leading lamas, in particular those ofthe fourteenth century. Born in the region of Dolpo, in what is today far northwest-ern Nepal,103 he traveled as a young man to Central Tibet, where for a number ofyears he studied with one leading teacher after another in succession. His pursuit ofBuddhist learning was wide-ranging and open: monastic discipline and the ethicalpath of the bodhisattva, epistemology and Madhyamaka philosophy, tantric and yogicinstruction in a variety of lineages—all figure prominently among his studies. In histhirties, he arrived at the hermitage of Jonang to learn the esoteric teachings of theKalacakratantra (The Tantra of the Wheel of Time) from the adept Yonten Gyamtsho(1260-1327),104 and it was here that his quest found its end. He became the master'sforemost disciple and lineage heir, and it was under Dolpopa' s leadership that Jonangbegan to emerge as the center of a distinct sect and philosophical tradition. Thememorial caitya that he constructed to honor his teacher became one of Tibet's cel-ebrated religious monuments, graphically representing his vision of the Buddhistcosmos as a whole.105 During his last thirty years, he taught widely throughout Cen-tral Tibet and Tsang, attracting a large following and leaving an enduring impres-sion on Tibetan Buddhist practice and thought.In some respects, this is the quintessential Tibetan \"local boy makes good\" story:a youth of humble origins, belonging to a religious family, goes forth to study widelyand eventually becomes the disciple of some of the leading masters of his time.106Attaching himself to one lineage in particular, he becomes established as a promi-nent teacher in his own right, and his career begins to unfold as the actualization ofthe tradition to which he is heir, a cosmic event understood in its relation to a historyspanning many lives, and embodying an entire cosmology. Where Dolpopa is per-haps a distinctive figure, if not an entirely unique one, is in the self-conscious deter-mination with which he elaborated this enterprise, so as to generate an altogetherdistinctive material and doctrinal expression of it.107 This is above all in evidence inthe case of his foundation of the great memorial caitya for his teacher, a caitya de-signed as a grand embodiment of the universe with its myriad Buddhas, bodhisattvas,and tantric divinities. Dolpopa's own abundant writings about caityas make it en-tirely clear that he saw its construction as an event of transcending importance,108and it is of crucial significance that his distinctive teaching of \"extrinsic emptiness\"is said to have been proclaimed at this time.109 Here, however, our chief concern willbe the vision of historical time that his cosmic vision entailed.Doxography and HistoryIn the Indian and Tibetan traditions of Buddhist scholasticism, the study of the sev-eral doctrinal and philosophical approaches to the interpretation of the teachingwas in large measure a matter of doxography.110 The perspectives of texts and au-thors were allocated to distinctive \"schools,\" whereupon the primary task for thedoxographer became the characterization of the doctrines of the schools in ques-tion. Unremarkably, the doxographic approach tended to flatten out distinctionsamong authors allocated to a particular school and works attributed to a singleauthor. It tended, too, to ignore history almost entirely. Without much exaggera-tion, we may say that, though Buddhist philosophy indeed had a history in Indiaand Tibet, there was nevertheless no history of philosophy."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"108 Sources of ContestationFigure 6.2 Dolpopa. A modern image at Se Monastery in Sichuan.Or almost none. It is clear, for instance, that the authors of philosophical com-mentaries in Sanskrit often had knowledge of the earlier commentarial history of thetexts with which they were concerned. That is to say, they knew, more or less, thechronological sequence in which the earlier commentaries were composed, andwho it was that was refuting or defending whom. So, for instance, Candraklrti onBuddhapalita and Bhavaviveka.111 But we may point, too, to other examples:Haribhadra's references to the earlier commentarial tradition of the Abhisa-mayalamkara (The Ornament of Emergent Realization),112 for example, or Yaso-mitra's to that of the Abhidharmakosa (The Treasury of the Meta-Doctrine).113One of the contributions the Tibetans certainly made to the Indian traditions theyinherited was to accentuate and elaborate the apparently thin historical elements foundin Indian commentaries and doxographical writings. Despite the tendency within themonastic colleges to deprecate history as a frivolous distraction,114 historical andlegendary narratives were much loved by Tibetan authors, so that the frequent in-corporations of hagiographical and historical elements within Tibetan exegeticalwritings is not at all surprising. For the most part, in Tibet as elsewhere in the Bud-dhist world, doctrinal history emphasized the succession of lineages, and here inno-vation and change were frequently effaced in an effort to establish authority by dem-onstrating the invariability of what had come down from the past.115 No doubt, too,"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism\"? 109the great emphasis on lineage histories as sources of religious legitimation withinthe esoteric traditions of Tibet did much to encourage this tendency.116 In some cases,particular currents in Buddhist philosophical thought became the subject matter forlineage history as well, and this perhaps influenced the doxographical literature: wemay point to the fourteenth-century Grub-mtha' (Philosophical Systems) of UpaLosel. Here, the first folios provide short accounts of the lives of the great IndianBuddhist philosophers—Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, and others—drawing upon, for in-stance, the relevant prophetic verses of the Manjusrimulatantra (The Root Tantra ofManjusri).117Still, the incorporation in doxography of short hagiographical digressions is notwhat we generally mean when we speak of the history of philosophy. That we do notuse this phrase univocally in our own intellectual community, and that history ofphilosophy in the West is indeed a contested category, has been well and conciselyargued by Richard Rorty in an exceptional article entitled \"The Historiography ofPhilosophy: Four Genres.\"118 But in the present context, we may be excused if ourusage remains a bit rougher than Rorty would countenance there: the history of phi-losophy may be understood generally as involving the conception that historicalchange and intellectual change are rather deeply interconnected, that historical timeis not just a container in which ideas indifferently occur, like furnishings that may berearranged anywhere in a room. There is a temporal order to the world, and the his-torical articulation of ideas reflects it.Buddhist doctrine, in certain of its aspects, is certainly capable of harmonizationwith such a perspective.119 The notion of the decline of the doctrine, for instance,correlated the degeneration of human life in several spheres with the corruption ofviews. The ramifications of this and allied conceptions were influential far beyondIndia, where they originated, and shaped East Asian Buddhism in important re-spects.120 The belief that a particular scripture or doctrine was especially suited to aparticular age was among its important entailments.121 But this is not quite the sameas the effort to read the earlier history of philosophy as a disclosure of the changingshape of lived time.Now, there are a number of occasions where we do find Tibetan authors goingbeyond the mere superaddition of hagiography to doxography to suggest, at least, amore genuinely historical approach to Buddhist thought: notable in this regard is thework of Serdok Panchen Sakya Chokden (1428-1507), who authored important his-tories of both epistemology and Madhyamaka thought.122 Gelukpa schoolmen, more-over, though coming from a tradition that generally discouraged the study of history,nevertheless did have opinions about the historical unfolding of the doctrine, whichwe find very well articulated in such writings as the introduction to the great Grub-mtha' Ihun-po mdzes-rgyan (Philosophical Systems: The Ornament Beautifying theWorld Mountain) of Cangkya Rolpe Dorje (1717-1786).123 Here, the doctrinal historyof the teaching is depicted as a series of oscillations between brilliant articulations ofthe Buddha's intention, and the degeneration of understanding in the generations thatfollowed each such disclosure, this cyclical process reaching its culmination, for theTibetans at least, with the appearance of Je Rinpoche Tsongkhapa Lozang Trakpa(1357-1419). The repeated movement towards refinement of the doctrine, however,occurs in a contrapuntal relationship with a pattern of general decline, so that we arriveat the only apparently paradoxical conclusion that, as Cangkya writes:"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"110 Sources of ContestationEven as behavior has visibly spreadTo new depths of degeneration,Even now through [Je Rinpoche's] grace,The secret of the Sage's words has not vanished.124Dolpopa's Teaching and the Four Ages of the DoctrineThe Tibetan Buddhist school generally represented as standing in the most extremeopposition to the Gelukpa in matters of doctrinal interpretation, namely the Jonangpa,was also among those that elaborated a distinctive view of the history of the doc-trine.125 The controversial philosophical teachings of Dolpopa, the first great expo-nent of a distinctively Jonangpa viewpoint, have aroused growing interest amongspecialists in Tibetan and Buddhist Studies since Ruegg first described the doctrinesof the Jonangpa school as they are reported in the Grub-mtha' shel-gyi me-long (TheCrystal Mirror of Philosophical Systems) of Tuken Lozang Choki Nyima (1737-1802) and so established the unique position of the Jonangpa tradition in TibetanBuddhist thought.126 The key doctrine of the absolute's \"extrinsic emptiness\" (gzhan-stong) with respect to superficial phenomena was there presented in some detail tocontemporary students of Buddhist thought for the first time, though the perspectiverepresented by Tuken was that of a determined opponent of the Jonangpa \"heresy.\"More recent contributions have made it clear that the intellectual and spiritual legacyof Dolpopa has remained influential among the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism downto the present time, whether this be through the extreme antipathy to his views evincedby his philosophical opponents, or through the ongoing attempt to retrieve and re-formulate what seem to be his most enduring insights.127 An entry into his way ofthought may be found in his interpretations of the Prajnaparamita, the perfection ofwisdom, or discernment.As we have seen in chapter 5 (p. 80), the Sandhinirmocanasutra (The Sutra WhichSets Free the [Buddha's] Intention) was invoked by scholars who held that the sec-ond of the Buddha's three \"turns of the wheel of the doctrine\" was a provisional teach-ing surpassed by the third and final turn, which alone was definitive and unsur-passed.128 The paradigms of the second turn, however, are generally thought to bethe Prajnaparamita Sutras, and the most authoritative commentaries on their inten-tion to be the Madhyamaka writings of Nagarjuna. Like those who opposed his teach-ing, Dolpopa clearly regarded these to be in some sense definitive too. We may askthen how Dolpopa sought to resolve the apparent conflicts to which his position gaverise. This question, certainly, is of some importance: Tsongkhapa's decisive rejec-tion of Dolpopa's approach to interpretation, and the formation of the Gelukpacommentarial tradition as one in many respects opposed to the Jonangpa, are amongthe issues that must be related directly to it.129Dolpopa, though perhaps in some respects an eccentric interpreter, was not sooverwhelmed by his own vision that he lost sight of the foremost objections that mightbe raised to it. Scattered throughout his writings are hints about how he thought thesewere to be met; on the question of the interpretation of the second turn of the wheel,a comment responding precisely to the line of criticism that Tsongkhapa would laterrefine and defend is found in his most famous work, the Ri-chos nges-don rgya-mtsho(Teachings for Mountain Retreat: The Ocean of Certainty):"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism \"? IllSome hold the \\Sandhinirmocana\\sutra to be of provisional meaning, but this isunreasonable, for such has been neither declared [in scripture], nor is it establishedby reason, and therefore [the sutra in question] is of definitive meaning andunobjectionable.It is objected, however, that, because the middle turn is Madhyamaka, and the lastMind Only, then it is the middle that remains of definitive meaning, while the lastremains provisional.But this is most exceedingly unreasonable, because there is neither scriptural au-thority nor reason [establishing] the final turn to be the proper canon (rang-gzhung)of Mind Only, for its teaching surpasses Mind Only, and it teaches the culminatingsignificance of the Great Madhyamaka, and teaches [this] in accord with the culmi-nating significance of the Vajrayana.130It is clear why some such maneuver appealed to Dolpopa and other Tibetan propo-nents of similar positions; for sutras typically considered paradigmatic of the thirdturn of the wheel, such as the Lankavatara and the Gandavyuha, do indeed teachmuch that surpasses Mind Only, at least given the relatively restricted perspectiveon that philosophical school that had come to dominate the doxographical literature.Indeed, these sutras are not infrequently cited as authorities by major teachers of theMadhyamaka, like Candrakirti and Santideva, and this was taken by Dolpopa andhis adherents as providing some support for the conception of a \"Great Madhyamaka\"tradition surpassing the more widely known Madhyamaka philosophical schools, asunderstood, once again, according to the doxographical stereotypes.131 Finally, butcertainly not least, there were many in Tibet who held that the Vajrayana, the way ofmantra, was in crucial respects a \"higher\" teaching than that of the sutras, and thatthe apparent affinities of the tantras with at least some of the sutras of the third turnare more pronounced than with the sutras of the middle turn.132 But where does thisleave the Prajnaparamita itself? Dolpopa's discussion continues:The second turn ... is not taught to be of provisional meaning and surpassed, etc., forthe reason that it teaches Prajnaparamita, but rather because it teaches that which isnot intrinsically empty to be intrinsically empty, and for other such reasons. ThePrajnaparamita that is unborn, unceasing, primordially pacific, etc., is taught in thethird turn and in the Vajrayana. But it is taught [in these three respective divisions ofthe teaching] unclearly, clearly, and exceedingly clearly. . . .In short, Dolpopa suggests that the Prajnaparamita Sutras, in their verbal form, donot always clearly articulate the teaching that is in fact their intention, namely, theteaching of the nucleus or inherent potential for buddhahood shared by all livingbeings, which is also known as nondual gnosis, the Great Seal, the enlightened mindin its absolute aspect, et cetera.133 And this he identifies as well with emptiness,reality, Perfection of Discernment, and so on.134 Dolpopa in this way combines theformulation of a qualitative gradation of the teaching with a type of esotericism:135the Kalacakra Tantra, for instance, is in many respects held to be superior to theAstasdhasrikd Prajnaparamita, (The Eight Thousand-Line Perfection of Wisdom),but their essence is suffused with the same radiant light, which just shines morebrightly in the former. And this, he goes on to say,"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"112 Sources of Contestationis the culminating emptiness-cum-compassion, means-cum-wisdom, that is the coa-lescent union of bliss and emptiness, the sole savor; and this is also the sole savor ofthe union of the expanse (dbyings, dhatu) and awareness, in which the culminatingabiding nature of reality, as noesis and noetic object, is one. Such is the real (mtshan-nyid-pa) Prajnaparamita, the culmination of the Prajnaparamita of the ground and thePrajnaparamita of the result, the quiddity of [their] indivisible essence. The pathwhereby it is disclosed and the canon which teaches these [topics under discussion]are only conventionally designated (btags-pa-tsam).Dolpopa, however, does not provide us merely with such general and idealizedaccounts of the Prajnaparamita teaching; his view of Prajnaparamita is developed inimpressive detail in four major commentaries and several short commentarial notesdevoted to the Prajnaparamita literature. The most important of these works are adetailed commentary on the Abhisamayalamkara, and separate commentaries onthe Astadasasahasrika (The Eighteen Thousand-Line Perfection of Wisdom), thePancavimsatisahasrika (The Twenty-five Thousand-Line Perfection of Wisdom),and the Satasahasrika (The Hundred Thousand-Line Perfection of Wisdom).136 Whilea preliminary survey of this material suggests that Db'lpopa generally restrained hisinclination to read his philosophy of extrinsic emptiness into these texts, neverthe-less he does not hesitate to articulate it when remarking on those passages in whichthe relative \"unclarity\" of the Prajnaparamita surras seems to intimate the \"clarity\"of the sutras of the third turn, or the \"exceeding clarity\" of the tantras. Thus, in a noteon the sixth fascicule of the Satasahasrika, he writes thatthe absolute ground of emptiness is extrinsic emptiness, self-emergent gnosis, thechangeless absolute, the nucleus of the [Buddha] who has fared well (sugatagarbha,bde-bar gshegs-pa'i snying-po), the Great Madhyamaka, the real Prajnaparamita anddie culminating Secret Mantra. .. .I37And elsewhere, where it is a question of the innate virtue of all dharmas, \"whichbeing insubstantial are empty, naturally luminous (rang-bzhin-gyis 'od-gsal-ba,prakrtipmkasa), and therefore good (dge-ba, kusald)\" Dolpopa briefly enumer-ates the deities of the Kalacakra, Hevajra, and other mandalas, who, like Rupavajra(\"she who embodies the adamantine essence of form\"), are taken to be apotheosizeddharmas; for it is precisely the goodness of those dharmas, as disclosed in thePrajnaparamita, that is deified in the tantras.138But how do Dolpopa's views about this relate to his peculiar views about Bud-dhist history? He offers some elements of his response to this question in a letteraddressed to his disciples, in which he summarizes his views regarding a wide vari-ety of particular topics:Relying upon the determination of the many exalted sources in which the Buddha,the Transcendent Lord, has definitively spoken, and on the autocommentaries thathe has clearly spoken, I have had much to teach you that is profound and especiallyexalted, and generally causes the increase of discriminative intelligence. Concern-ing that, following the flawless doctrines and persons of the Krtayuga [the PerfectAge] endowed as they were with measureless qualities, there emerged, among thefamous doctrines and persons of the Tretayuga [the Third Age] and later ages, thosethat have had repute while being in fact untrue. So it is inappropriate to have con-fidence in them."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism \"? 113Now, then, it is well ascertained by pure scriptural authority and reason that thewidespread assertion that the third wheel of the transmitted precepts is Mind Only isuntrue. The Mahayanasutralamkara (The Ornament of Mahayana Sutras) and all theother doctrines of Maitreya are ascertained to be texts of the Great Madhyamaka; theBuddhavatamsaka (The Bounteousness of the Buddha), the Mahanirvana (The GreatDecease), etc., that are renowned as the surras of Mind Only, are ascertained to be thesurras of the Great Madhyamaka; and Arya Asanga and his brother [Vasubandhu],and acarya Dignaga, and others, many of whom are renowned as scholars of MindOnly, are also ascertained to be Madhyamikas. This widespread assertion that theyhave commented on Madhyamaka in the manner of Mind Only is also ascertained tobe untrue. ...It says in the Sandhinirmocanasutra, among pronouncements of the Buddha, theTranscendent Lord: \"Then the bodhisattva Paramarthasamudgata said to the Transcen-dent Lord, 'The Transcendent Lord has at first, in the land of VaranasI in the Mrgadravaat Rsipatana, on behalf of those who had truly entered the vehicle of the pious atten-dants, turned the amazing and wonderful wheel of the doctrine teaching the four sub-lime truths, which had not been turned previously in accord with the doctrine by eitherany god or any man in the world. That turning of the wheel of doctrine by the Transcen-dent Lord is surpassed, contextually relative, of provisional meaning, and verballydebatable. Then, beginning with the phenomenal absence of essence, the TranscendentLord has turned the second most amazing and wonderful wheel of the doctrine, speak-ing of emptiness on behalf of those who have truly entered the greater vehicle, takingas the point of departure the absence of production, the absence of cessation, primor-dial quiescence, and the natural, complete attainment of nirvana. That turning of thewheel of doctrine by the Transcendent Lord is surpassed, contextually relative, ofprovisional meaning, and verbally debatable. Then, the Transcendent Lord, beginningwith the phenomenal absence of essence, on behalf of those who have truly enteredall vehicles, turned the exceedingly amazing and wonderful third wheel of the doc-trine, which is endowed with excellent analysis. This turning of the wheel of doctrineby the Transcendent Lord is unsurpassed, not contextually relative, and of definitivemeaning. It is not subject to verbal debate.\"139 In these and other ways he has saidthat [the third turning of the wheel] is endowed with profound distinctions.Acarya Dharmamitra and others say that in this passage the middle transmission[referred to] is the Madhyamaka and is of provisional meaning, while the final trans-mission [referred to] is Mind Only and is of definitive meaning; and they call it aconfusion to make [Madhyamaka,] which is not refuted by reason, into provisionalmeaning, and [Mind Only,] which is refuted, into definitive meaning. But in this case,their rebuttal is directed against the Buddha, the Transcendent Lord, and so will beregarded by believable witnesses as confusion compounded by confusion! For therecan be none greater than the Buddha; and he has not taught the final [turning of] thewheel to be Mind Only; and both the middle and the final [transmissions] equally teachabsence of essence, nonproduction, noncessation, original quiescence, and the com-plete nirvana that is naturally attained; and it is a grotesque perversion to hold that hehas said what he has not said, namely, that Madhyamaka is of provisional meaningwhile Mind Only is of definitive meaning. . ..The intention is to distinguish intrinsic emptiness and extrinsic emptiness. Thosewho do not do so and say that it is all only intrinsic emptiness, and that emptiness isnot determined in terms of extrinsic emptiness, but that only intrinsic emptiness de-termines emptiness, and maintain that all the [scriptural] statements that ultimately"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"114 Sources of Contestationthere is existence, permanence, self, purity, and truth are of provisional meaning, whilall the statements of nonexistence, impermanence, nonself, impurity, and rottennessare of definitive meaning, and that the nine or twelve absolutes, the ultimate body ofreality, the essential body, natural luminosity, natural coemergence, natural great bliss,the naturally innate, natural nirvana, the natural and spontaneously achieved mandala,and so on, as well as the natural abiding buddha-family (gotrd) with its many classi-fications, the ultimate nucleus of the Tathagata (tathagatagarbha) endowed with manyattributes, and so forth, are to be held with respect to reality but that reality itself is tobe held as intrinsically empty—these and more are so many perverse views, coarseand bad views, without number. All are to be dispelled by making a genuine witnessof the scriptural authority and reason of the Krtayuga tradition. Though there are manywho adhere to the evidence of the Tretayuga and later polluted and flawed scripturalauthorities and reasons, these are in fact inappropriate as genuine witnesses. There-fore, do not follow in their path of error!140In these concluding sentences, Dolpopa invokes concisely his view of Buddhisthistory and its implications for Buddhist hermeneutics: he appears to have combinedwidespread beliefs regarding the decline of the doctrine with the notion of cosmictime, common to several Indian traditions, embodied in the scheme of four yuga, orworld ages.141 The task for the would-be interpreter of the Buddha's teaching, ac-cordingly, is to recover the teaching of the Perfect Age, or Krtayuga (Rdzogs-ldan),and to shun the misunderstandings foisted upon the teaching by the mundane schol-ars of the Third Age, or Tretayuga (Gsum-ldan), and later periods.142 The principlesaccording to which Dolpopa distinguishes among the ages of the doctrine have yetto be adequately determined on the basis of his writings, though my general impres-sion is that in this regard he is primarily concerned with doxographical classifica-tion, allocating philosophical doctrines to \"aeons\" according to purely dogmatic, andnot temporal, criteria. The closest Dolpopa ever seems to come to a clear articula-tion of his conception's general architecture is in his Bka'-bsdus bzhi-pa'i don bstan-rtsis chen-po (The Great Calculation of the Teaching, Whose Significance Is theFourth Gathering of the Transmitted Doctrine).143 In introducing this work, he writes:The great four aeons concern the quality of the temporal kalpa,And the lesser four aeons the quality of the teaching.The first is in years four million,Three hundred and forty thousand; its fourth partIs called a \"foot,\" and one, two,Three, and four feet are, respectively, calledKali, Dvapara, Treta and Krt.As for the lesser four aeons, concerning the quality of the teaching,Their duration is of 21,600 human years,One-fourth of which provides the measure of each of the four aeons.Faultless, endowed with all virtues, is the doctrine of the Krtayuga.Then, when that fourth has passed, there is the \"former\" Treta.When half has passed, it becomes the \"latter\" Treta.The remainder when three-fourths has passed is Dvapara,And when not even one-fourth remains there is the Kaliyuga,Said to be the evil doctrine of demons and of barbarians."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism\"? 115Having become well aware of these distinctions,Desiring to purify and to cleanse the teaching,To establish self and others on the excellent path,The excellent doctrine of the Krtayuga should be accepted as one's solewitness.The Treta and what follows are flawed,Their texts corrupted like milk in the market.In no case should they be accepted as witnesses.The superior refutes the inferior,As superior philosophical systems refute their inferiors.144The Krtayuga doctrine is the taintless transmission of the Conqueror,That has been definitively spoken by the lords of the tenth bhumiAnd by the great, systematic path-breakers.145It is not at all clear how Dolpopa wished to apply the four-aeon scheme to theactual historical interpretation of Buddhism, except through an aprioristic allocationof texts and commentators to aeons on the basis of the doctrines they upheld. Basedon what we have seen already, what can be offered in the way of a preliminary state-ment of the theory's application is a brief list of some of the characteristic writingsbelonging to the Krtayuga doctrine, namely: the teachings transmitted by Sakyamunihimself and their \"autocommentaries\" (rang-'grel, by which Dolpopa seems to referto those passages in the sutras offering guides to interpretation); the doctrines ofMaitreya; the writings of Nagarjuna, Asanga, Vasubandhu, Dignaga, and perhapsseveral of the other great panditas of India. Arya Vimuktisena, Haribhadra, and someof the other late scholastic masters are named as representing the teachings of theTretayuga.146 Note, however, that they are not so classified owing to the late periodin which they lived and worked; one of the last great panditas of Buddhism in India,Abhayakaragupta, seems certainly to have been considered by Dolpopa to have beena sage of the Krtayuga.147 Significantly, too, Dolpopa persistently labels his owncommentarial tradition the Krtayuga Tradition (Rdzogs-ldan-lugs).14*Sources of InspirationWhere did Dolpopa get his ideas about the history of the doctrine, or were they, rather,the product of wholly unprecedented innovation? He himself answers this questionfor us:What I have said upon careful analysis, that \"The greater and lesser four aeons,\"et cetera, may be found in the great commentary upon the Glorious Kalacakra.149And this is just where one familiar with his work would have thought to look, evenif Dolpopa had not mentioned it explicitly. But, we must ask, what does the \"greatcommentary upon the Glorious Kalacakra,\" that is, the Vimalaprabha (TaintlessLight) commentary, in fact say that would support Dolpopa's viewpoint? The rel-evant passage, found in comments on verses 22-23 of the Lokadhatupatala (TheChapter on World Systems), proves to be highly suggestive but exceedingly thin:On the farther sides of Meru, the one who cannot be conquered by the demons orbarbarians roams the earth where the religion of the Tathagata has been destroyed andtheir perverse religion is current. In that terrain, the Cakrin roams, his practice during"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"116 Sources of Contestationthe Kaliyuga being irreligion. This is the significance of his \"carrying the Kaliyuga.\"That, indeed, is the Kaliyuga whose nature is irreligion. In whatever region the religionof the barbarians is carried, in that region, especially, he travels. Having slaughteredin battle the barbarians and others, including the demons, he wanders, converting thosbefore him to his own religion. Thus the \"other\" Krt, Treta, and Dvapara, and the[\"other\"] Kaliyuga proceed by connection with time. Here \"other yuga,\" the Krt, etc.,means that this is not the great Krtayuga, etc. This yuga proceeds by connection withtime. Time is the circle of the zodiac. ...In whichever part [of the earth] the Cakrin dwells in power, there proceeds theKrtayuga. The meaning here is that the doctrine of authentic and perfect Buddha(Samyaksambuddhadharma), which is called \"Krtayuga,\" proceeds. .. .15°The essential framework, then, is indeed to be found just where Dolpopa has told usto look. In order to develop a view significantly similar to Dolpopa's on this basis,however, we would need to know just what the Vimalaprabha regards the content ofthe \"doctrine of authentic and perfect Buddha, which is called 'Krtayuga,'\" to be,and about this that commentary is by no means clear, save to say that the doctrine ofthe Kalacakra Tantra itself must be at least part of what is intended. One furtherpassage that may have inspired Dolpopa in this connection is the commentary onAdhyatmapatala (The Chapter of Inner Meaning), verses 161-179, in which a briefdoxographical survey of Buddhism and some rival doctrines (including Islam) is tobe found.151 Significantly, verse 161 and its commentary describe emptiness (sunyata)as \"not insentient\" (ajada, bem-miri), a locution that would figure prominently in thearguments of the partisans of extrinsic emptiness (gzhan-stong), and of their occa-sional allies, the Kagyiipa Great Seal and Nyingmapa Great Perfection proponents.If it is correct to suppose that Dolpopa took what is in fact by and large a verygeneral account of esoteric Mahayana philosophical doctrine, as is that offered inthe Adhyatmapatala, to be a normative dogmatic tract supporting his identificationof the philosophical quintessence of the Krtayuga doctrine with his own teaching ofextrinsic emptiness, then the inspiration for his theory may in fact have been theVimalaprabha alone. And to this we must add that because in a past life he himselfhad been the noble king of Shambhala, KalkT Pundarika, to whom the authorship ofthe Vimalaprabha is attributed,152 he could indeed claim that his teaching was thatof the Perfect Aeon, according to the principle that \"in whichever part [of the earth]the Cakrin dwells in power, there proceeds the Krtayuga.The Problem of \"Mind Only\" and the Legacy of the TheoryDolpopa's original contribution to the development of Buddhist thought in Tibetmay be seen as an effort to elaborate an account of the actual content of theKdlacakratantra 's \"teaching of the golden age,\" philosophically, in terms of extrin-sic emptiness and the doctrines allied to it, and hermeneutically, as we have seen, interms of his classification of Indian Buddhist writings taken to represent that teach-ing. The picture of the historical degeneration of the doctrine that this involved sug-gested to Dolpopa, among other things, that the interpretation of the teachingsof Maitreya, Asanga, and Vasubandhu as representing a Mind Only (Sems-tsam,Cittamatra) school was itself the product of that degeneration, and that, in conjunc-tion with Nagarjuna, the works of these thinkers should be interpreted as representa-"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism \"? 117live of the Great Madhyamaka teaching (Dbu-ma-chen-po).153 It is this teaching, ofcourse, that Dolpopa proposes to retrieve through the extrinsic emptiness doctrine.Dolpopa's suggestion raises, however, an unavoidable problem in doctrinal history,for just how are we to understand the position of what is called the Mind Only schoolin the light of the proposed redescription? I emphasize this problem not so muchbecause it is significantly more prominent than others that Dolpopa entertained,but because it presents us with a particularly clear example of the ramifications ofDolpopa's theory for the writing of Buddhist history in Tibet.In the letter to his disciples, parts of which we have examined here, Dolpopa hasmuch to say about the relationship between the so-called Mind Only school and histheory of the four aeons of doctrine. There we have seen that he writes:Arya Asariga and his brother [Vasubandhu], acarya Dignaga, and others, [who] arerenowned as scholars of Mind Only, are also ascertained to be Madhyamikas. Thiswidespread assertion that they have commented on Madhyamaka in the manner ofMind Only is also ascertained to be untrue. ...Later he develops his position as follows:Acarya Haribhadra stated that,\"Vasubandhu, the kinsman benefiting beings,Making his own inclination foremost,Explicated [the text], having rightly reliedOn the inwardness of the knowable.\"154As for the assertion, based upon this, that acarya Vasubandhu is therefore [a propo-nent of] Mind Only and his textual commentaries are the texts of Mind Only—this isin fact completely untrue. If one thinks it to be true, then have him investigate care-fully whether or not the most supreme commentary, the Gnod- 'jams (The Defeater ofObjections) and the autocommentaries that the Buddha, Transcendent Lord, has him-self definitively spoken are in accord.155Similar arguments are offered concerning Asariga and Dignaga. Dolpopa in effectreasoned that, because we know that Mind Only is manifestly not a correct view,and that Asanga, Vasubandhu, and Dignaga were teachers who held correct views,they could not have been proponents of the obviously false teaching of Mind Only.But Haribhadra, for instance, has attributed just that doctrine to Vasubandhu, whichshows us that he did not clearly comprehend the teaching of the Krtayuga and there-fore must be assigned to the belief system of a later, degenerate age. The so-calledMind Only school turns out on this account to be an interpretive mistake, the inven-tion, not of Asanga and Vasubandhu, but of those who misread them.Dolpopa's picture of Buddhist history was to have its own important legacy inTibet and was to resurface, albeit in modified form, in later authors such as Taranatha(1575-1634), Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820-1892), and Jamgon Kongtriil LodroThaye (1813-1899).156 Perhaps most striking among the modifications we find intheir works is an alteration in the story that is told to explain the philosophical em-barrassment of Mind Only. A recent retelling may be found in the Jo-nang chos-'byung (The History of the Jonangpa Tradition), by Khenpo Lodro Drakpa (1920-1975), who writes:"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"118 Sources of ContestationSometime after the three gatherings of the Hmayana transmissions were done, therecame, moreover, about five hundred teachers of the doctrine, including the great andvenerable Avitarka, who propounded the Mahayana doctrine. From various places theybrought forth and then propogated many sutras of the Mahayana [belonging to] theMahayana Pitaka, including the Lahkavatara, the Ghanavyuhasutra, and so on. Fromthis arose the substantialist idealist tradition (dngos smra-ba'i sems-tsam-lugs) of theMahayana school.157The \"great Madhyamaka\" tradition only arises afterwards, thanks to the continuingdisclosures of the definitive significance of the Mahayana by Saraha, Nagarjuna,and Asanga. And Khenpo Lodro Drakpa elsewhere specifies that, though the \"sub-stantialist idealist tradition\" is known from later commentarial writings, the originaltreatises of Avitarka and his colleagues were never translated into Tibetan and so areno longer available.158What are we to make of this tale? I am not certain where it in fact originates, orwhether it was in circulation prior to the age of Taranatha (1575-1634).159 Appar-ently, Dolpopa knew nothing of it. To understand what may have motivated itsacceptance, however, it must be noted that Dolpopa's assault on Haribhadra prob-ably could not be sustained. Indeed, until Dolpopa's own extensive commen-taries on the Abhisamayalamkara have been thoroughly examined, we cannot evenbe certain that Dolpopa was entirely consistent on this score. However that maybe, there can be no doubt that, given Haribhadra's great prestige for Tibetan com-mentators on the Abhisamayalamkara,160 and the widespread Indian doxographi-cal evidence for a Mind Only tradition,161 something better than Dolpopa's storyabout the supposed late commentarial misreading of Asanga and Vasubandhuwas required if the historical vision of the Krtayuga tradition was to be main-tained. Avitarka and the five hundred teachers were, I suspect, literally \"made toorder.\"It was Gilbert Ryle who said of the history of philosophy in the West that \"our stan-dard histories of philosophy\" were \"calamity itself, and not the mere risk of it.\"162Richard Rorty, elaborating upon Ryle's thought in the article mentioned earlier, writesthatawkward attempts to make a new question fit an old canon remind us ... that newdoxographies usually start off as fresh, brave, revisionist attempts to dispel thedullness of the previous doxographic tradition, attempts inspired by the convictionthat the true problematic of philosophy has finally been discovered. So the realtrouble with doxography is that it is a half-hearted attempt to tell a new story ofintellectual progress by describing all texts in the light of recent discoveries. Itis half-hearted because it lacks the courage to readjust the canon to suit the newdiscoveries.163In part, Rorty's words appear apt for the case we have been considering, though,by the relatively conservative standards of Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism, Dolpopaand his successors may strike some as having remarkably sought \"to readjust thecanon,\" by however small a degree. That their efforts seem to us more successful inthe delineation of a philosophical standpoint than in the revision of Buddhist"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"What Is \"Tibetan Scholasticism\"? 119historiography, however, discredits them no more than, as Rorty reminds us, thedoxographic history of philosophy in other settings. We should not lose sight of thefact that, by making the history of Buddhist philosophy itself a field of contestation,Dolpopa may have to some degree actually encouraged the development of the tra-ditions of Tibetan Buddhist historiography that flowered in the writings of his suc-cessors, Taranatha above all.Contestation and Self-representationThose conversant with some of the varieties of Tibetan Buddhist discourse may ob-ject that I have loaded the dice in this chapter: though there are certainly importantstylistic and substantive differences among doctrinal authors, they are not, by andlarge, so profoundly divided as the presentation here seems to suggest. With this Iwould agree. To illustrate the point, we may note that Sakya Pandita, in writing onMadhyamaka philosophy, does countenance some place for skeptical argument,164while Karma Pakshi, as we know, wrote his own treatise on epistemology.165 Dolpopa,for his part, was educated by and enjoyed warm relations with the successors of bothand left his own mark on later Sakyapas and Kagyiipas.166There can be no question but that the relationships among differing schools andapproaches to doctrine were often fluid, and that Tibetan Buddhist thought per-mitted and sometimes even encouraged a remarkable degree of mutual exchange.Nevertheless, I am certain that anyone who has read these authors, among manyothers, with some care, cannot but conclude that, regardless of significant areas ofoverlap, there remain striking differences of approach and of content among them.The individuality of the major Tibetan thinkers is unmistakeable, whatever the dif-ficulties involved in attempting to convey that difference through a non-Tibetanmedium.167In a polemical work written in the early nineteenth century, the great poet andmystic Zhabkar Tshokdruk Rangdrol (1781-1850), after reviewing some of the dis-putes that had erupted in the history of Buddhism in Tibet, concludes that if a dialec-tician is skillful enough, he may prove anything at all.168 Indeed, in the monastic debatecourts of Tibet, the ability to mount a successful defense for what was generally re-garded as the weaker position was a much admired achievement.169 It should be nosurprise, then, that dialectical virtuosity could easily pass into sophistry. Argumentalone was regarded in some circles with suspicion and seldom supplanted the au-thority of tradition when it came to matters of practice. In the world of Tibetan Bud-dhism, as for Indian religious traditions more generally, orthopraxy was crucial, or-thodoxy less so. The famous claim of the Buddhist logicians that the only two validcriteria for knowledge were direct perception and inference tended to represent anideal; a Buddhism of \"reason alone\" was never realized, except perhaps in the imagi-nations of small numbers of monk-scholars.There are, however, other dimensions of intellectual contestation in the Tibetanworld that in some respects may be of greater importance than the very interestingquestions surrounding the soundness and validity of arguments. Janet Gyatso, in herfine recent study of the secret autobiographies of the \"treasure-revealer\" Jikme Lingpa"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"120 Sources of Contestation(1730-1798), examines in depth the general problem posed by the remarkable pro-duction of an abundant autobiographical literature in Tibet. Some of her conclusionswarrant consideration here as well:Compelling reasons for self-assertion and distinction can be traced to the dawn of thehegemony of Buddhism in Tibet, which produced a competitive climate in which thepersonal accomplishments of the individual religious master became a centerpiece inthe straggle to establish a lineage and eventually an institution and a power base. .. .The comparative absence of culture and traditional authority in the wake of the col-lapsed empire gave the individual religious entrepreneur considerable leeway for self-assertion .. . religious power and prestige were based upon ability and personalachievements.170Something similar, I think, is at work in the articulations of doctrine we have beenconsidering here. In the contest for authority within the Tibetan religious world, thecrafting of a distinctive vision that at once established both the personal virtuosity ofthe author and his (or in rare cases, her)171 mastery of what was sanctioned by tradi-tion became a fundamental means of self-representation. This helps us to understand,for instance, the apparent paradox of Sakya Pandita's Eight Ego Poem, which I haveconsidered in greater detail elsewhere but which bears repetition here:I am the grammarian. 7 am the dialectician.Among vanquishers of sophists, peerless am /.7 am learned in metrics. / stand alone in poetics.In explaining synonymies, unrivaled am /./ know celestial calculations. In exo- and esoteric science7 have a discerning intellect equaled by none.Who can this be? Sakya alone!Other scholars are my reflected forms.172We must recall that this bit of doggerel was authored by a prominent Buddhist monk,an exponent of the teaching of the selflessness of persons.It is in this context, too, that we should also recall the assertion with which KarmaPakshi began his autobiography:I am Rangjung Dorje,The vajra-king, one of great might. ...Further, Dolpopa's identification with the kings of mythical Shambhala, and his tacitreliance on this identification as one of the warrants for his doctrinal speculations,must, I think, be seen in the same light.This is not to say, of course, that reason and argument were wholly subservient toother interests, which they effectively masked. Doctrinal claims were only a singleelement in a larger field of contestation, in which many means of self-assertion mightalso be deployed. One result, which I have tried to illustrate in this chapter, was thegreat diversity and creativity of Tibetan Buddhist thinkers and visionaries, particu-larly prior to the fifteenth century, after which time the emerging dominance of theGelukpa sect began gradually to narrow the range of scholastic thought.173 As weshall see in the following chapter, however, there was still much left to debate, evenunder the Gelukpa's ascendant star."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"7The Purificatory Gemand Its CleansingA Late Polemical Discussionof Apocryphal TextsOur Notions of Buddhist Canon and ApocryphaWhen we first entertain the notion of Buddhist apocrypha, it may seem that thequestions to be addressed are entirely straightforward ones: which Buddhist texts areto be considered apocryphal? what are their sources? how are they regarded withinthe Buddhist world? Indeed, it seems that such terms as \"canon\" and \"apocrypha\"have well-established and clearly defined positions within the field of contemporaryBuddhist studies, and that as students of Buddhism we know just what it is of whichwe speak whenever we employ these terms.1 Some scrutiny, however, reveals ourusage to be equivocal: works termed \"canonical\" with reference to one traditionalBuddhist context must be labeled \"apocryphal\" with reference to another, for instance,the entire corpus of Mahayana sutras;2 and texts that may be said to exemplify ca-nonical scripture for the devotees of a given tradition are held to be apocryphal ac-cording to the canons of traditional or contemporary scholarship, for example, theChinese Suramgama-sutra (The Sutra of the Hero's March).3 It is evident that forstudents of Buddhism the terms \"canon\" and \"apocrypha\" are not closely similar tothe same terms used by, say, contemporary writers on Protestantism, who have well-defined sets of scripture in mind whenever they employ them. Thus, before proceed-ing to the main subject matter of this chapter—the problem of the revealed \"treasures\"(gter-ma) as treated in Tibetan polemical writings of the eighteenth century—we mustfirst clarify the concepts we ourselves introduce into the discussion.Let us begin with the notion of \"canon.\" The term itself, with its meanings of\"measure, model, norm, standard,\"4 is prima facie suggestive of our Buddhist termsutra—\"thread, measuring line, plan, aphoristic rule\"5—and by extension carriessome of the import with which Buddhists endow the terms buddhavacana (\"Bud-dha-speech\"), buddhabhasita (\"spoken by the Buddha\"), and saddharma (\"TrueDharma\"). What a given Buddhist community considers to be buddhavacana,et cetera, is what, or at least is part of what, we would say it holds to be canonical,that is to say, representative of the ultimate scriptural authority to which it adheres.The important point to note is that \"being canonical\" is here not a one-term predicate"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"122 Sources of Contestationof which the variable term is a given literary corpus, as it is in the sentence \"The PaliTipitaka is canonical.\" Rather it is a,two-term predicate of which the relata are a lit-erary corpus on the one hand and a religious community on the other, as in \"The PaliTipitaka is canonical for Theravada Buddhists.\" When an individual representing agiven religious community employs the concept of canonicity, or some analogousconcept, he usually does intend the one-term predicate, as when, for instance, a Theraargues for the unique authenticity of the Pali Tipitaka, and the inauthenticity of otherBuddhist scriptural collections. He is saying, in effect, that canonicity is a propertyuniquely exemplified by the Pali Tipitaka. But this is not how contemporary schol-ars in the field of Buddhist Studies usually employ the concept. We instead intendthe two-term relationship \"being canonical for,\" as it is only in this way that we canavoid absurdity in our discussions of the various canons: Pali, Tibetan, Chinese, andso on. In this sense, we may surely speak of the Mahayana sutras in general, or theChinese Suramgama-sutra in particular, as canonical texts, whatever may be decidedregarding their origins.6Our second key term is \"apocrypha.\" As used in contemporary Buddhist Studiescircles, this word often seems to mean \"a text or group of texts regarded as canonicalwithin some Buddhist community, but whose origins are somehow other than theyare supposed to be.\"7 It is in this sense that we may speak of the Mahayana sutras asapocryphal. As such, a text is called \"apocryphal\" not so much in virtue of its beingso regarded within the tradition in whose scripture it is found, but rather in virtue ofthe scholar's judgement. If we ride this concept of apocrypha too hard, we may findourselves left with very little Buddhist scripture that we can unequivocally hold tobe nonapocryphal. Like the pilgrims of The Journey to the West, we may arrive atthe end of our search to discover only blank scrolls where we thought we woulduncover the Buddha's original teaching. The whole notion of Buddhist Apocryphathus becomes too meaningless to be of scientific value, though it may still be of usein the formulation of a new koan, to be used in the instruction of those among uswhose philological meanderings have led them far from the true path.The use of the term \"apocrypha\" to refer only to supposed inauthenticity of ori-gin is, of course, in some respects dissimilar to its use in Jewish and Christian con-texts, in which, after all, the concept evolved. Schneemelcher, for instance, consid-ers New Testament Apocrypha to be \"writings which have not been received intothe canon, but which by title and other statements lay claim to be in the same classwith the writings of the canon... .\"8 Most of what we regard as Buddhist Apocryphaare, on the other hand, texts that have indeed been \"received into the canon\" of oneBuddhist tradition or another. The traditions that cast doubts upon their authenticityoften discount them altogether as worthless deception.9 In short, it is not at all evi-dent that there is any such thing as \"Buddhist Apocrypha,\" if by that we mean torefer to a scriptural corpus that plays a role within some given Buddhist communityanalogous to that played by the apocryphal literature of the Jewish and Christian tra-ditions. A close approximation would be the \"spiritual treasures\" (gter-ma) of theTibetan Nyingmapa tradition, extracanonical works that are regarded by theiradherents as having a quasi-canonical status and by their opponents as being pseud-epigraphical and anathematic. So there may be some similarity here with the bibloiapokryphoi of the Gnostics.10 The analogy, however, is not sufficiently strong toprovide a basis for the regular use of the phrase \"Buddhist Apocrypha\" except in the"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Purificatory Gem and Its Cleansing 123sense first defined, that which refers to texts whose origins, when scrutinized from aphilological standpoint, are deemed suspect. As such, there would appear to be noharm in retaining the phrase, so long as we maintain a cautious awareness that itembodies certain concepts that we may impute to traditional Buddhist discourse butthat may not be truly represented therein.11In the light of the foregoing remarks it can be said that this chapter concerns theproblem of canonicity as conceived by two Gelukpa polemicists, and in particulartheir opinions of apocryphal traditions. At issue are their views regarding which tex-tual traditions are to be taken as embodying the ideal norms or standards of Buddhistreligious discourse and which are to be seen as failing to embody those ideals owingto supposed inauthenticity of origin. No attempt will be made here to establish anormative concept of the Tibetan Buddhist canon to which to relate the opinions ofthese authors; my only concern will be to elucidate those opinions and the reasonsfor which they were held. Before addressing this directly, however, it will be neces-sary to summarize some of the important elements of the canonicity debate that theTibetans borrowed from India, and that inform the broadsides of Sumpa KhenpoYeshe Peljor (1704-1787) and Thuken Choki Dorje (1737-1802).Realism, Idealism, and Scriptural AuthenticityThe early schools of Buddhism may be characterized as having sought to embrace,in varying ways and to varying degrees, a naive metaphysical realism. Apparentwholes were to be analyzed into their parts, but the parts were real. Moreover, therewas a strong tendency to temporal realism running throughout the abhidharma lit-erature and made fully explicit in the Sarvastivada school and its branches. The worldwas thus constituted for the early traditions much as it is for the untutored imagina-tion, that is, of real things obtaining at determinate locations in space and time. Ad-hering to such a view, we should want buddhavacana, the Buddha's utterances, tobe just that, the actual speech sounds produced at given places and times by Sakyamunihimself. There is some reason to believe that the early schools did, in fact, wish toaffirm such a view.12Disregarding, however, the question of how consistently the assertion that therealistic orientation of early Buddhism carried over into its historical presuppositionscan be maintained, it is certain that this was just what was asserted by thinkers withinthe Tibetan scholastic traditions. Sabzang Mali Panchen (1294-1376), perhaps thegreatest Tibetan Sanskritist of the fourteenth century, for instance, while comment-ing on Bodhicaryavatara, chapter nine, verse 42, expounds the position of thesravakas as follows:The sravakas say: \"[T]hose texts of the Mahayana are not the declarations spokenby the Buddha, because they were not heard by the great sravakas who were alwaysin the [Buddha Sakyamuni's] following when he dwelt in the locations spoken of inthe Mahavibhasa:The site of the doctrinal wheel, Vaisali,Pandara, the realm of the gods... .'\"13"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"124 Sources of ContestationThe rigid adherence to such a view, if unqualified in any way, has the undesirableentailment that buddhavacana, in the strict and literal sense, came into being withthe first turning of the wheel at Rsipatana and ceased to be with the parinirvanaat Kusinagarl. Hence, in the strict and literal sense, there has been no authenticbuddhavacana in the world since the Buddha's decease. There is no evidence tosuggest, however, that anyone within the Buddhist tradition ever actually heldsuch a rigid position; the view must be softened in order to admit into the class ofbuddhavacana not the spatiotemporally determinate speech acts of Sakyamuni alone,but all speech acts and written symbols that are in some sense the same as the speechacts of the Buddha himself. The problem is: in just what sense?The various attempts to define suitable criteria whereby buddhavacana might bedistinguished from its opposites have been surveyed in some detail by R. M. Davidsonin his fine article on this topic and so need not be repeated here.14 The definitionselaborated for this purpose, depending as they do on concepts of consensus, doctri-nal content, accord with manifest reality, and so on, all involve a weakening of theview suggested by a strict historical realism. That the early schools indeed departedfrom that view was well known to learned Tibetan circles through, for instance,Vasubandhu's assertion that to say that a text handed down in all the other nikayas(here referring to the early Buddhist orders) and contradicting neither sutra norreality is not buddhavacana, merely because one's own nikaya does not recite it, ismere recklessness.15Buddhavacana then can be recognized owing to the coherence of a certain bodyof tradition and doctrine, and owing to the coherence of these with the way the worldhappens to be, as is revealed to us in immediate experience. While this view sug-gests a modification of the realist position, it does not yet constitute a complete aban-donment of realism; for the concepts of buddhavacana consisting of the actual speechacts of the Buddha and of its being a coherent body of texts as determined by certainpatterns of consensus and the fulfillment of explicit doctrinal criteria are in no wayto be taken as contradictory, but must be seen to be complementary. The claim thatmust be made in order to assert without absurdity that the former is buddhavacanain the strict and literal sense while the latter is buddhavacana nonetheless is simplythat the textual traditions held to represent the authentic teaching of the Buddha aresystematically correlated to the speech acts of Sakyamuni. The various attempts todefine criteria for buddhavacana may thus be seen as efforts to pinpoint the relevantsystematic correlations. These efforts failed in part, no doubt, because the exclusivelyoral transmission of the dharma during the first centuries of the Buddhist era precludedthere being any simple and straightforward set of verifiable correlations.16 And a cri-tique of oral tradition in the manner of that suggested by early Greek historiographywas unthinkable, for that would have involved tacitly acknowledging (though hereperhaps falsely) that very little reliable could be known of the Buddha's teaching.17Tibetan scholasticism inherited from this state of affairs the full tension betweenthe impulse to affirm that in fact there was some set of determinate correlations link-ing the original buddhavacana to its present instances, and the impossibility of everdiscovering decisively what these correlations might be. For this reason, as will beseen, it was never successful in its attempts to elaborate from the standpoint of ahistorical realism a satisfactory set of criteria for scriptural authenticity. In additionto the conflicts inherent in the realist approaches to canonicity, however, the Tibet-"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Purificatory Gem and Its Cleansing 125ans also derived several alternative orientations, all involving the rejection of theearlier realism.Confronted with the defects of the early criteria, one possible reaction was sim-ply to adopt those criteria for one's own purposes, while ignoring their historicalpresuppositions. The concepts of accord with sutras and with perceived reality,et cetera, were sufficiently imprecise to be applied not only to the scriptures of theeighteen schools, but to the Mahayana scriptures as well. The step half taken in thenikayas can now be completed, namely, to turn the question of scriptural authenticityfrom a historical problem into a hermeneutical one, as do the Mahayanasutralamkara(Ornament of the Mahayana sutras) and Santideva's Bodhicaryavatara.™ Still, thisneed not involve an unqualified rejection of the realist position. Indeed, a realist read-ing of the relevant texts places in high relief the conclusion that, though it may seemstrange to certain modern sensibilities, figured prominently in Mahayana attitudesto scripture throughout Central and East Asia right down to the present day: anytext meeting the normative doctrinal criteria for buddhavacana must be genuinebuddhavacana taught by the historical Buddha Sakyamuni himself.19Another reaction to the problem, inspired by the luxuriant cosmologies, idealistmetaphysics, and numinous buddhology of the Mahayana sutras of the \"third turn-ing of the wheel,\" in particular, involved a complete overthrow of the realist pro-gram. This approach, already apparent in the Ghanavyuhasutra (Sutra of the DenseArray) and others among those discussed by Davidson,20 influenced Tibetan thoughtabove all through the exquisite teaching of the Ratnagotravibhdga (Discriminationof the [Three] Jewels and the Family [of Buddha-Nature]), which elaborates a theoryof Buddha-activity, inclusive of the Buddha's speech, in which the Conqueror fig-ures, for all intents and purposes, as the first principle and final cause of the spirituallives of all beings.21 For fortunate beings hear the Buddha's message without anyeffort on the part of the Sage himself, like the spheres that revolve through the ef-fortless agency of the unmoved mover:Just as among the gods,perforce of the gods' ancient virtues,Without effort, locus, intellectual form,or conceptualization,The carefree gods are repeatedly rousedby the drumbeat of the doctrine,With a proclamation of impermanence and pain,of selflessness and of peace;Just so it is that the Lordwithout effort embraces all beingsWith the speech of the Buddha and teachesthe doctrine to those of good fortune.As the divine drumbeat among the gods,is born from their own actions,So the Sage's spoken doctrine among worldlingsis born from their own actions.22In the predominantly idealist milieu in which we now find ourselves, some crite-ria are still required in order to distinguish buddhavacana from whatever happens to"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"126 Sources of Contestationcome to mind. This problem, however, is a purely hermeneutical one. The manner inwhich it was treated is best indicated by an oft quoted verse from the Ratnago-travibhdga, the author of which, one fancies, must have greatly enjoyed turning thediction of the classical sravakayana to such good use:Meaningful speech, associated with doctrinal phrases,Causing abandonment of the three realms' utter defilement,And demonstrating the advantages of peace:Such is the rsi's speech; others are its opposites.23In one sense, then, buddhavacana is exactly what we always imagined it to havebeen; only its metaphysical ground and etiology are regarded differently. In Tibet,the line of speculation represented here found its richest expression in the works ofDolpopa and his successors, the proponents of the extrinsic emptiness (gzhan-stong)of the absolute. Aspects of these developments have been considered in the preced-ing chapter; their peculiar implications for the question of scriptural authenticity maybe illustrated by the virtually Platonic view of the Buddha's speech (one wonders iflogos might not be the better word to use here) propounded by Jamgon Kongtriil LodroThaye (1813-1899/1900):If one examines such a text [in this case the Ratnagotravibhaga} carefully, there arethree [aspects of it]: (1) first, it is the self-manifest speech-resonance of the Buddha,the absolute aspect of the Mahayana sutras which is included within the nondual cog-nition that has arisen as all things—as such it is essentially identical with what is natu-rally pure, or the body of reality (dharmakaya) that results from separation [from for-tuitous obscuration]; (2) second, it is the Mahayana sutra endowed with groups ofwords, phrases, and phonemes that has arisen in the minds of exalted and ordinarypersons in the form of universal expressions; and (3) third, it is the words and phrasesuttered in conformity with that, which are termed the text, the sutra or tantra of thedefinitive meaning of the Mahayana. These last two are essentially completely differ-ent from the trio of nature, fruit, and path; but they have arisen from the aspirations ofBuddhas, substantially accord with the body of reality, and have the power to bringabout the abandonment of the two obscurations. Therefore, know them to be includedamong the uncorrupted principles (anasravadharma), the utterly refined objectives(vaiyavadanikalamband), and the entirely real (parinispanna).24The Purificatory Gem and Its Cleansing:Historical BackgroundBy 1782, in which year Sumpa Khenpo authored the Gsung-rab rnam-dag chu 'i dri-ma sel-byed nor-bu ke-ta-ka (The Purificatory Gem Which Removes Filth from thePure Water of Scripture)25 and Thuken penned his reply, entitled Nor-bu ke-ta-ka'ibyi-dor (The Cleansing of the Purificatory Gem),26 the question of scriptural authen-ticity had been debated in Tibet, with various degrees of acrimony, for the better partof a millenium.

It should not surprise usthen to discover, as we did in chapter 5, that there were Tibetan Buddhists who sim-ply ignored this decision and continued to study eclectically traditions stemming fromboth India and China.It was the restoration of monastic Buddhism in western Tibet, from the late tenthcentury onwards, that provided the ground for the next great eruption of controversyover matters of authenticity. Samten Karmay, in a series of important articles, hasbegun to assemble the materials needed for a thorough documentation of the spo-radic debates of the period, known as that of the \"later spread of the Teaching\" (bstan-paphyi-dar)?1 Two issues figure prominently in the known polemics: under the broadmantle of Vajrayana, morally repugnant practices were spreading among the Tibetans;and many of the texts that were finding favor were suspected of being Tibetan forg-eries rather than authentic Indian Buddhist works. It is the second of these issues thatis of interest to us here.Under fire were works teaching the Great Perfection doctrine and a miscellaneousassortment of Vajrayana texts supposed to have been transmitted in Tibet during theimperial period, but now seemingly unknown in India. The situation became increas-ingly complex from the eleventh century onwards with the appearance of \"spiritualtreasure\" (gter-ma), texts said to have been concealed by Padmasambhava and otherancient masters and now rediscovered for the timely edification of receptive indi-viduals. Tibetan Buddhist masters adopted a whole range of positions with respectto such texts: some, not desiring to be burdened with the sin of blaspheming theDharma, wished to affirm the authenticity of all that seemed to have some spiritualvalue; others, seeking to gain the merit of revealing false paths to be false, urged therejection of any and all questionable works; and still others preferred to adopt a middleposition, accepting some among the contested scriptures while rejecting others. AsTibetan sectarian trends ossified, from the twelfth through the seventeenth centuries,the first of these three positions came to characterize the Nyingmapa school and its"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"128 Sources of Contestationsympathizers, the second became predominant among the Gelukpas and the Ngorpabranch of the Sakyapa school, and the middle positions came to be occupied primar-ily by the various Kagyiipa lineages and by the remaining Sakyapa traditions.32 Theformulation of standard polemical defenses for the position taken by one's own schooland assaults on the positions of others went hand in hand with the formulation of thegreat scholastic commentarial traditions, and the leading polemicists are in most casesfamed exegetes: Sakya Pandita Kiinga Gyeltshen (1182-1251),33 Comden RikpeiReldri (fl. 1311-1320),34 Buton Rinchendrub (1290-1364),35 Longchen RabjampaDrime Ozer (1308-1363),36 Terchen Ratna Lingpa (1403-1478),37 Serdok PanchenShakya Chokden (1428-1507),38 Gorampa Sonam Sengge (1429-1489),39 KarmapaVIII Mikyo Dorje (1507-1554),40 and Sokdokpa Lodro Gyeltshen (b. 1552)41 beingforemost among them. It is quite certain that there has been little, if any, method-ological refinement in the contributions to the debate made by writers following theage of the figure last mentioned. The polemics of recent decades differ in few sig-nificant features from those of three centuries ago,42 and, owing perhaps to its grow-ing anachronism, recent sectarian invective often seems coarser than the debates ofprevious generations. This is no doubt due in part to the heightened political fac-tiousness of Tibetans in the wake of the disaster of 1959, and all that has since fol-lowed.43 Prior to the twentieth century, Tibet never seems to have produced an ana-logue to the Japanese thinker Tominaga Nakamoto (1715-1746), one who wouldshake the fundamental presuppositions of the entire scriptural authenticity questionand in so doing open the way for the emergence of a new scholarship.44In the light of these considerations, I have chosen the debate between SumpaKhenpo and Thuken Rinpoche as a paradigmatic case. Coming relatively late, itillustrates both the content and the method of the traditional problem and its tradi-tional solutions in all their main aspects, and, at the same time, it represents a scho-lasticism that has not yet died the death of stagnation. Also governing my choice isthe fact that Tibetanists have previously called attention to facets of Sumpa Khenpo'spolemic and in so doing have, I think, sometimes misinterpreted both its intent andits method. I shall return to this last point below.The Texts and Why They Were WrittenSumpa Khenpo's Purificatory Gem is a product of the author's old age. It was writ-ten when he was in his seventy-ninth year45 and xylographically published immedi-ately thereafter under the author's supervision.46 The first Western scholar to havecalled attention to it appears to have been A. I. Vostrikov, who describes it as a \"smallbut highly interesting critical and bibliographical work\"47 and evidently found it mostvaluable, to judge from his many references to it.48 More recently, Ariane Macdonald,Samten Karmay, and Eva Dargyay have all referred to Sumpa Khenpo's polemicalwritings—usually not to the work under consideration here but to passages from hisDpag-bsam Ijon-bzang (The Wishing Tree, his history of Buddhism)—which are, inany case, similar in content to parts of the Purificatory Gem.49The ostensible purpose of the Purificatory Gem is to distinguish between authen-tic and inauthentic scripture (gsung-rab dag-ma-dag).50 The reasons for undertak-ing this exercise are firmly grounded in Buddhist soteriology:"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Purificatory Gem and Its Cleansing 129An intelligent person who carefully examines what is or is not the Conqueror's dec-laration, doing so with a mind subtle in respect to word and meaning owing to [theknowledge of] scriptural authority and reason, correctly distinguishes between theauthentic and the inauthentic. Having done this, he rejects those which are inauthen-tic and adulterated and doubtful, and he honors, respects, worships, and praises evena small volume of authentic scripture. If he strives to listen to, read, recite, write,publish, and teach to others its words, and to cultivate meditatively its meaning forhimself, he will easily attain all perfect spiritual and temporal goals.51Accordingly, the main portions of Sumpa Khenpo's work are devoted to the con-sideration of what constitutes authentic Scripture,52 and what inauthentic.53 The sec-ond, much longer, part has three subsections, each questioning the authenticity ofvarious texts: several contained in the Gzungs- 'dm (Collected Dharanls), a popularscriptural collection;54 the three-volume selection of tantras of the Nyingmapa schoolthat is appended to the Kanjur;55 and sundry texts including gter-ma and the worksof the Bonpo tradition (900.7-904.1). The critique of inauthentic scripture then closeswith a final summary and statement of conclusions.56In contrast to the Purificatory Gem, Thuken's Cleansing of the Purificatory Gemhas been overlooked in the Tibetological literature. It was composed, according tothe colophon,57 by Dharmavajra (= Chos-kyi-rdo-rje) in 1782 in response to the tractof his own guru, Sumpa Khenpo, and constitutes virtually a point-by-point critiqueof that work. It was most unusual in Tibet to launch a broadside against one's ownmaster, and Thuken goes to obvious pains to excuse himself.58 The irregularity of awork of this type, however, coupled with the fact that it is not to be found in Thuken'spublished Collected Works,59 may lead to the suspicion that the Cleansing of thePurificatory Gem is a forgery. Nonetheless, there can be little doubt that in this casethe attribution is a true one: this is not the sole instance in which he showed stronginterest in traditions subject to the disapproval of some segments of Gelukpa ortho-doxy.60 There is really no aspect of the Cleansing of the Purificatory Gem, whetherof style or of content, that strikes one as being too inconsistent with Thuken's knownliterary work. While it was cited in polemical writings in Amdo no later than themiddle part of the nineteenth century, there seems to be no instance of any polemi-cist denying its authorship.61 Finally, it should not be forgotten that Thuken wasundoubtedly something of a Nyingmapa sympathizer.62 This, however, only partiallyaccounts for his decision to criticize the Purificatory Gem of Sumpa Khenpo. Tounderstand the underlying difference of outlook between master and disciple in thiscase, we must look to the political circumstances that contributed to the shaping oftheir respective careers.Sumpa Khenpo, as a young Gelukpa monastic scholar and official in Central Tibetbeginning in the mid-1720s, was intimately familiar with the civil upheavals ofthe early eighteenth century.63 The strife had its immediate roots in the sectarian-cum-regional rivalries of the preceding century, whose outcome had been decided pri-marily through the intercession of the Khoshot Mongols on behalf of the Gelukpas andtheir patrons in the central province of U, united under the leadership of the Fifth DalaiLama. In the wake of the rale of the Great Fifth, Ngawang Lozang Gyamtsho (1617-1682), and of his regent Desi Sanggye Gyamtsho (1653-1705), the embers of faction-alism burst into flame once more. In 1717 the Mongols of the Dzungar tribe took fulladvantage of the situation: they looted and plundered the monasteries of the Gelukpas'"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"130 Sources of Contestationopponents and even murdered a number of leading hierarchs.64 All of this was cer-tainly deplorable, but for one of Sumpa Khenpo's background—he was, after all, aMonguor tribesman who in his early twenties had been a student at Gomang College,seat of the Dzungars' guru, Lozang Phiintshok—the Dzungars had merely helped theTibetans do what they could not do themselves, namely, put their own house in order.65Though Sumpa's later years were to be spent enjoying the fruits of the Manchu-Gelukpaalliance, his formative years were thus spent in the crucible of bitter sectarian conflict,so that, for all his intellectual gifts and real curiosity, he was probably never capable ofregarding sects other than his own from a truly unbiased perspective.66Thuken, on the other hand, had a rather different experience, in which CentralTibet and its affairs were not to figure as the determining influences on his develop-ment overall. Like his teacher, he was a native of Amdo, and one of TibetanizedMongol ancestry, too. But Lhasa was not the political center that drew him into itsorbit.67 Peking was. In this, he had more in common with another of his masters, thegreat Cangkya II Rolpe Dorje (1717-1786), than with Sumpa. He was one of ageneration of clergymen from Amdo whose spiritual loyalties were unmistakablyGelukpa, but who allied themselves politically with the Qing court.68 The worldviewof these churchmen bore a strange resemblence to that of medieval Latin Christendom,with the Manchus filling the role of Imperial Rome and the Gelukpa hierarchy thatof the Catholic Church. These were not the products of a denomination under firebut rather represented the synthesis of a peerless salvific vehicle with a universaltemporal order. Not personally threatened by the Central Tibetan feuds, they couldafford to regard the situation there only with equanimous compassion. Their intel-lectual curiosity could be given free rein to explore their own and other traditionsimpartially. Within their own domains, they were capable of regarding adherents ofthe other schools of Tibetan Buddhism with paternal kindness. Considering this andconsidering, too, that among the Amdo laity the Nyingmapa and Bonpo traditionscommanded great devotion indeed,69 the motivation underlying the Cleansing of thePurificatory Gem becomes clear: Thuken wishes his flock to know that his master'srhetoric represents merely the sectarian sympathies of an earlier generation that haveno longer any useful role to play, and that he, for one, will not stand for a rebirth ofintolerance and hostility among them. This, at any rate, is what we must take Thukento mean when he tells us that one reason he is challenging Sumpa Khenpo is to in-sure that \"contemporary persons who prattle without understanding what is essen-tial will not come to amass sinful deeds in the name of the doctrine.\"70 That Thukendoes impute a measure of bigotry to his teacher is confirmed by his assertion thatSumpa Khenpo's purpose in writing the Purificatory Gem was \"to obstruct the wayof those persons who desire liberation on the basis of some rites of the Nyingmapaand Bonpo, which are widespread in these parts.\"71It appears, then, that in addition to the conceptual parameters described earlier inthis chapter, another set of factors restricted the scope of the traditional Tibetan dis-cussion of canonicity, namely, political and sectarian convictions.72 For this if forno other reason, the traditional scholarship, despite its excellent achievements inelaborating the Buddhist scholastic curricula, was incapable of giving rise to a whollycritical method of textual research analogous to that which developed in the Westafter the Renaissance. To see just what was at stake we must now review the argu-ments presented in the texts themselves."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Purificatory Gem and Its Cleansing 131The Question of Spiritual TreasuresWhat constitutes authentic scripture? We have seen that the various Buddhist tradi-tions elaborated a whole range of answers to this question. The answer supplied bySumpa Khenpo in the Purificatory Gem involves a curious mixture of themes thatrepresent no single source in particular. He begins:Each and every aspect of what was spoken in a single instant in Jambudvipa by theTranscendent Lord of the Iksvaku clan bestowed on numberless fortunate beings inneed of training a limitless mass of doctrine. Among what remained [of that mass], atthe time of the third council that which was retained in the minds of those of infallibleretention was set down in writing. Most was preserved in the three doctrinal spires ofNalanda monastery, and, though most of that was damaged when later enemies thricethreatened the teaching, some part of what remained was translated in earlier and latertimes into Tibetan by translators who were like the eyes of the snowy land. That iswhat is renowned as the Kanjur.73This account probably has to be read as elliptical for the detailed narratives of theemergence of the doctrine found in, for instance, Sumpa's own History™ What isremarkable is his assertion that, on the one hand, every aspect of the Buddha's speechrefracted in unlimited ways among those who heard the Sage, but that, on the other,only a limited, determinate number of such refractions that are \"utterly pure, unadul-terated by later fools,\"75 are available to us today, that is, that the canon is a closedone. To know which texts belong to that canon, he continues, we must study thedescriptive catalogues prepared at the order of the ancient kings or under the author-ity of the patrons of the various editions of the Kanjur and repeat the titles recordedtherein.76 Among the many catalogues, the one compiled by Buton is to be regardedas particularly useful for this purpose, as is the briefer inventory found in KhedrubJe's (1385-1438) Rgyud-sde spyi-rnam (General Dissertation on the Tantras).77What this seems to amount to is an argument from authority: the authoritativedoctrinal histories and textual catalogues alone tell us what is authentic. SumpaKhenpo never raises the question of why it is that we are to accept this or that par-ticular history or catalogue as being authoritative, and so he never answers it. Hav-ing made clear just who his authorities are, there is apparently no need to justify hispreferences, beyond an appeal to Gelukpa orthodoxy. With the contents of the canonthus established, we may turn to the rejection of apocryphal traditions.Of the three main catagories of suspect text with which Sumpa Khenpo is con-cerned, the treasures (gter-ma) fall into the very last. Before reviewing his argumentfor their rejection, it must be said in all fairness that, from a critical point of view,this is not the best section of the Purificatory Gem. Its interest is to be found in itssubject matter, rather than in the virtues of the argument. Sumpa's finest argumenta-tion, however, occurs in his attempt to identify spurious texts in the CollectedDhdrams. It is there that he proceeds on a case-by-case basis, noting specific fea-tures of vocabulary and style that he thinks count against the authenticity of thosetexts. While his effort is certainly flawed, it does reveal the author's intention to elabo-rate precise, philologically significant criteria for scriptural authenticity. This initself was no mean achievement and must be taken into account in assessing SumpaKhenpo's contribution overall.78"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"132 Sources of ContestationSumpa' s critique of \"spiritual treasures\" (gter-ma) is already well known to Tibetolo-gists through Vostrikov's work.79 The essence of the argument is as follows:Though there appears to be no report that the mahasiddha Padmasambhava composedmany sastras in the snowy land when he arrived at the time of the first building ofTibet's Samye temple, even if the so-called Padma thang-yig (The Testimonial Recordof Padmasambhava)80 and Thang-yig sde-lnga (The Five Testimonial Records)81 hap-pened [to be written] at that time I have doubts as to whether or not there are corrup-tions in their present texts. Moreover, it is easy to tell that they [i.e., Padmasambhavaand the other masters of the imperial period] did not compose even a fraction of themany current \"ancient doctrines\" (rnying-chos) which cover the snowy land, includ-ing the Mani bka'-'bum (Mani Kambum),82 Bar-do thos-grol (The Liberation-by-Hearing in the Intermediate State),83 and the Nyes-pa kun-sel (The Removalof All Ills), Rnga-sgra (The Drumbeat), Ngan-sngags phyir-bzlog 'khor-lo (TheDiscus Repelling Evil Spells), and others which are found in the aforementionedCollected Dharams.M Those \"ancient doctrines\" were later attributed to OrgyenPadma[sambhava] and, moreover, the famed \"transmitted precepts\" (bka '-ma) and\"spiritual treasures\" (gter-ma) were composed by numerous frauds, who mixed themwith some words of the Conqueror as they wished. Any learned person who looks atthem can know this easily.85It is of course the case that, with reference to some of the texts mentioned, con-temporary Tibetologists have arrived at much the same conclusion as did SumpaKhenpo.86 But we should not lose sight of the fact that scholarship consists not ofmerely arriving at conclusions, but also of justifying them. Sumpa Khenpo doubtsthe authenticity of the Testimonial Record of Padmasambhava and of the ManiKambum, but never does he give us a detailed and critical account of his reasonsfor harboring those doubts. This being so, the correctness of his position is any-thing but self-evident. Given that he wishes his readers not merely to question thehistorical credentials of the popular works concerned, but to reject them spiritu-ally as well, it should be no cause for astonishment that his opinion here met fierceopposition. Thuken's rebuttal is a classic defense of the entire Tibetan revelatorytradition:Again, in the Purificatory Gem a general declaration is made, beginning, \"whateverare well known as 'profound doctrines, authoritatively sealed' (zab-chos bka '-rgya-can),'earth doctrines' (sa-chos), 'stone doctrines' (rdo-chos), 'celestial doctrines'(gnam-chos), and 'treasure doctrines' (gter-chos), have been forged by deceitful frauds. . . .\"[and ending:] \"[O]ne must not unhesitatingly take up whatever one runs into, be it pureor impure, as a hungry dog takes up whatever it runs into, be it edible or inedible.\"87To this we pray to respond: \"profound doctines, authoritatively sealed\" are com-mon to the Gelukpa, Sakyapa, and Kagyiipa. Because there are a great many profounddoctrines which have been authoritatively sealed by the Conqueror Vajradhara him-self, I believe your declaration leads to great absurdity.88If all \"celestial doctrines\" were forgeries, nonetheless the Dpang-skong phyag-rgya(The Gesture of Contrition, T 267), a celestial doctine which fell from the heavens inthe time of Lha-tho-tho-ri, is classified in your text as being pure.89 Now, if the primeexample of that which is defined as a \"celestial doctrine\" is classed as pure, then, wereyou to seek for a century, you would not find some other impure celestial doctrine.90"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Purificatory Gem and Its Cleansing 133The appellations \"earth doctrine\" and \"stone doctrine\" are not familiar to anyone.There are those said to be \"drawn forth from the earth\" and \"drawn forth from therocks,\" but, as they are all \"treasure doctrines,\" there is no need to discuss them sepa-rately. It is not certain that they were all forged by frauds, for there is a propheticdeclaration in the Manjusrimulatantra (The Root Tantra of ManjusrI, T 543):Afterwards at that timeA bhiksu known as an arhat. ..Will by great austerities bring forthAt that time, from a vase,Sutras of the Mahayana,Which I had expounded in the past.Having studied that volume,He will recite such mantras... .91Just so, the tale of the bhiksu famed as an arhat, who brought forth from an auspi-cious vase whatever doctrines, including sutras, he desired, and then attained prac-tical experience of them, is found in many doctrinal histories. In the Damomurk-hasiitra (The Sutra of the Wise and the Foolish, T341), too, a tale appears in whicha householder brings forth from his home's pillar a ritual describing the eightfoldfast.For those who are fortunate, the nectar of the true doctrine will emerge even fromearth, stone, mountain, or rock; for it says in the Sarvapunyasancayasamadhi-sutra(The Sutra of Concentration Which Gathers All Merits, T 134):O! Vimalatejas! those bodhisattvas, mahasattvas who desire the doctrine, andwho are endowed with a respectful and perfect attitude, though they dwell evenin other world systems, even then will the Buddhas, transcendent lords, re-veal their countenances to them, and they will hear the doctrine as well.O! Vimalatejas! there are doctrinal treasures for bodhisattvas, mahasattvas de-sirous of the doctrine, which have been secreted in mountains, ravines, andwoods. Dharams and limitless doctrinal gates which have been made into vol-umes will also come into their hands.92It is a bit coarse to declare that all treasure-doctrines were perpetrated by frauds. Notonly the Nyingmapa, but all the Indian and Tibetan schools (grub-mtha') have them.As examples: the tantras of Pacification (Zhi-byed) were brought forth by Phadampafrom the Charnel Ground of Delight in the Glorious Tan trie Cycles;93 the Maha-mayatantra (The Tantra of Great Illusion) was revealed in the land of Oddiyana byKukuripa;94 [the precepts of] the stage of perfection (rdzogs-rim) [entitled] Rlung-semsdbyer-med (The Indivisible Union of Vital Energy and Mind) were revealed by Marpain Vajrasana;95 the Seng-gdong sgrub-skor (Cycle for the Attainment of Simhamukha)was revealed by Guru Vajrasana-pada and by Bari Lotsawa from beneath a yaklikeboulder to the east of Vajrasana;96 some of the Kurukulla 'i sgrub-skor (Cycles for theAttainment of Kurukulla) were revealed by the Lama Shenyen Lotsawa, to whom Tarahad prophetically declared that they were to be found within the teat [of an image] ofDevi Dhumavati to the north of Vajrasana;97 the Lha-sa'i dkar-chag (Guidebook toLhasa) was revealed by Atisa at the \"vase-pillar\" (kwa-ba bum-pa-cari);9* some cyclesconcerning beneficial and harmful rites (phan-gnod las-tshogs), which were in the\"leaf-pillar\" (kwa-ba shing-lo-can), \"serpent-headed pillar\" (sbrul-mgo-can), and\"lion-headed pillar\" (seng-mgo-can) were revealed to some extent by both Lama Zhang"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"134 Sources of Contestationand Joden Konchok-trak;99 the Ro-snyoms skor-drug (Six Cycles of the Even Savor)were concealed by Rechungpa in accord with the prophetic declaration of Tiphupaand then later extracted from their treasury by the lord of beings Tsangpa Gyare;100the Sems-khridyid-bzhin nor-bu (Wish-Granting Gem of Psychological Guidance) wasconcealed as a treasure in the Black Mandal Lake101 by the venerable master DakpoRinpoche (Gampopa) and his disciple Kyebu Yeshe Dorje, and it was extracted fromits treasury by Dungtsho Repa Rinchen Zangpo of the Dakpo lineage;102 some of theRnam-sras-kyi sgrub-skor (Cycles for the Attainment of Vaisravana) were revealedat Vulture Valley by Nyelwa Nyima Sherap;103 and the Putra ming-sring-gi sgrub-skor (Cycle for the Attainment of Putra, Brother and Sister) were extracted from Samyeby Lhatsiin Changchup-o.104Even among our own virtuous sect,105 Gyiichen Sanggye Gyamtsho revealed somerites of Dharmaraja (Chos-rgyal-gyi las-tshogs), which had been concealed as trea-sures in the shrine of the protectors (mgon-khang) of Segyii (Sre-rgyud) by DillnakpaPelden Zangpo,106 and even the all-knowing Jamyang Zhepa seems to have intendedto acquire the prophetic declaration (lung-bstan) and treasure-sacraments (gter-rdzas)of Macik in accord with a prophecy from a treasure (gter-lung).101 In a dream whichcame to Trhichen Ngawang Chokdenpa, he received, from the venerable and greatTsongkhapa, who appeared about fifteen years of age, wearing garments of fine silk(rgya-ras), an injunction concerning the existence of some treasures which were tobe revealed atop the stupa at Changcup monastery (Byang-chub dgon-pa), but becausethe Khri-chen never traveled to the eastern provinces (Mdo-khams), the opportunityto obtain the treasures did not come about.108Moreover, it says in the Dam-chos mchog-gi rgyud (The Tantra of the SupremeHoly Doctrine, unidentified):O! Vajrapani! may you bring forthFrom treasure after treasureAll of the tantras and kingly tantras.Thus, there would seem to be no purpose [in asserting] that all treasure-doctrines areNyingmapa doctrines, or that all revealers of treasure-doctrines are deceitful frauds.109Thuken' s most powerful arguments against Sumpa Khenpo are clearly those thatinvolve widely accepted counterexamples (for instance, that of the Gesture of Con-trition) or those that are ad hominem (for instance, the arguments concerning reve-lations within the Gelukpa sect). There can be no doubt that from a strictly formalpoint of view he is entirely correct here: Sumpa Khenpo does condemn works thatmeet just the same criteria as certain widely accepted \"canonical texts,\" and his ownposition requires him to assert the validity of traditions that do not meet those crite-ria. The problem for the latter is that he seems to lean towards the affirmation of aconception of canon based on a historical view similar to that of early Buddhism,but imperfectly adhered to. The result is that he allows the canonicity of works that,from the perspective of the traditional scholarship, cannot be satisfactorily distin-guished from works he wishes to exclude from the canon.I remarked earlier that it seemed that the references to Sumpa Khenpo's polemicfound in the Tibetological literature suggest some misinterpretation of his intentand method. It is clear that there has been some temptation to characterize Sumpa'swork as \"critical scholarship,\" suggesting that it reveals some affinity with the text"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Purificatory Gem and Its Cleansing 135critical scholarship that has flourished in the West since the Enlightenment. Un-questionably, the analogy can be a misleading one, for Sumpa's biases did notallow him to develop a methodology that he could apply relatively impartially tothe entire mass of scripture with which he was familiar: critical scholarship bearssolely upon the works of his enemies. More satisfactory Western analogies to theTibetan debates on scriptural authenticity might be found in the medieval polemicsexchanged among Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thinkers,110 although SumpaKhenpo and his predecessors and contemporaries did certainly refine their discus-sions of textual traditions to a degree that in the West is more characteristic of thelate Middle Ages, perhaps, for instance, the work of Nicholas of Cusa.111 If thisanalogy is appropriate, then it would seem that while the Tibetan discussions ofcanon and apocrypha never succeeded in resolving the many difficulties inheritedfrom the Indian tradition, they did represent the beginnings of the development ofa consciousness of text-critical issues and, as such, merit careful attention. If acritical tradition similar to that of the post-Rennaissance West never blossomed,one reason can perhaps be seen in the ancient rejection of the historical realismthat is methodologically required for historical philology (even if in the end it is tobe overturned), and the concomitant failure to determine suitable criteria for thehistorical authenticity of the Buddha's word.The apocryphal traditions of Tibetan Buddhism—the traditions whose historicalcredentials seemed dubious, but whose spiritual credentials seemed to some, at least,impeccable—occupied an uneasy position between two opposing tendencies: thetendency to anathematize and the tendency to canonize. The former was supportedby elements of a realistic historical orientation, but above all by the conviction thatthe canon was closed and that its contents were known. The latter, by contrast, drewits strength from the belief that the canon could be held to be closed only on pain ofself-contradiction, and from a fundamentally idealist vision of the Buddhist world.The rift was intensified, finally, by purely political considerations whose perversealchemy transformed the gold of religious vision into the base metal of violent sec-tarianism. Once this had occurred, the conditions favoring the further developmentof a critical approach to the problems surrounding scriptural authenticity were lost,for the disputants' stakes were now too high to permit reasonably impartial and pro-gressive scholarship. As will be seen in the following chapter, one well-known tra-ditional scholar, the great historian and tantric master Taranatha (1575-1634), didarticulate the possibility of establishing something approximating a middle groundhere, by affirming that while at least some of the treasures were genuinely based uponearly materials, they were at the same time, nevertheless, elaborated by their \"dis-coverers.\" In this formulation alone do we find the possibility of an alternative to theaporia of unimpeachable authenticity versus willful fraud.During the mid-1980s, I expected that we would soon see new developments intraditional approaches to these matters, catalyzed by the encounter with contempo-rary methodologies of textual criticism. I could not have anticipated, however, thatEuropean and American scholars of Tibetan Buddhism would find themselves de-fending or condemning the \"treasures\" in a manner that closely recapitulates thepolarities of the old Tibetan disputes.112 In this regard, an interesting paradox comesto light in the late Michael Aris's important contribution to the discussion, Hidden"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"136 Sources of ContestationTreasures and Secret Lives, and points directly, I think, to the heart of the problem.Aris, who considered the famous Bhutanese treasure-finder Pemalingpa (1450-1521)to have been clearly a charlatan, writes:There is a peculiar reluctance on the part of many modern scholars to recognize theentirely fabricated nature of the Tibetan \"treasure-texts.\" It is as if their enthusiasmfor things Tibetan and Himalayan has blinded them to an obvious truth.

Apart from Pemalingpa's endearingly human weak-nesses ... there is the undoubted fact that his activities as a whole greatly enrichedthe cultural and spiritual life of his homeland and the regions beyond. The texts heproduced, the dances he composed and the works of art he commissioned are amongthe real cultural treasures of Bhutan to this day. Moreover, if on the one hand the au-thenticity which is claimed for the origin of these treasures is entirely suspect, on theother hand and on a different level surely they carry their own authenticity as the genu-ine product of an inspired and highly imaginative character, rogue though he was.113It is the apparent paradox of the fraud who is nonetheless genuinely inspired, andso becomes a real creator of culture, that interests me here. The question that we mustask, I think, is not so much whether the \"treasures\" were real or fake, but rather whyit was that, in traditional Tibet, creativity so often masked itself as the retrieval of thepast. Of course, this is not an entirely novel phenomenon in the history of highlyconservative religious traditions: the elaboration of the Hermetic corpus, the forma-tion of the Kabbalistic scriptures and above all of the Zohar, the revelations thatcontributed to the creation of the Taoist canon, and perhaps also the establishmentof the Mormon faith—all suggest parallel developments in a wide range of religiouscultures.A variety of factors may be variously at work in these differing settings. In allcases, the authoritative weight of the past, the conception that paradigmatic excel-lence is to be found in antiquity and that history is a system of entropy encourage avaluation of retrieval over invention or progressive discovery. In some cases, too,there is perhaps a need felt to reassert past tradition in the face of foreign novelty,while at the same time selectively appropriating what is novel and alien under thedescription of what is native and past: Taoism in its relation to the advent of Bud-dhism in China, and the older traditions of Tibetan Buddhism and Bon in their rela-tion to the post-tenth century influx of new teachings from India may be seen in thisway.I suspect as well that the argument of Plato's Meno has been tacitly presupposedmore often than its explicit occurrences would lead us to believe. There, let us recall,Socrates' questioning leads the untutored slave boy Meno to articulate a geometricproof, and so the philosopher demonstrates to his interlocutors that, prior to this life-time, knowledge of geometry had somehow been impressed upon Meno's soul.According to such reasoning, the knowing or creative individual must have beenpreviously exposed to what he now knows or makes, and the same argument must ofcourse be true in the first person: if I find myself to be endowed with some talent, it"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Purificatory Gem and Its Cleansing 137can only be because I acquired it long ago. Given the Buddhist affirmation of re-birth, and the special force it acquired in Tibet, it becomes axiomatic that \"authen-ticity as the genuine product of an inspired and highly imaginative character\" and\"the authenticity which is claimed for the origin of these treasures\" cannot be en-tirely different, even if a present act of manufacture is involved. The argument mayappear to us to be sophistical, but this is just because we really don't buy into theconcept of rebirth, and our culture's understanding and evaluation of individual cre-ativity are so radically unlike traditional Tibetan conceptions.We must fundamentally rethink, therefore, the problem of the rediscovered trea-sures in the history of Tibetan religions. The treasures are not exactly what they pre-tend to be, and yet they flow inexorably from the depths of the Tibetan cultural andreligious system. Every discovery is also a memory.

In thisfinal section I shall follow the same route once again, beginning in this and the fol-lowing chapter with some of the mythic aspects of the rediscovered treasures andrelated texts, but turning later to aspects of systematic thought which they embodyas well.The relationship between philosophical and mythic modes of thought often seemsproblematic, and one may feel that the question \"What is the relationship betweenphilosophy and myth?\" if not actually ill formed, is somehow fishy.2 That there doessometimes appear to be a peculiar relationship between myth and philosophical orscientific reason, however, is underscored when we turn to some now generally dis-credited theories of myth, for instance, Sir James Frazer's view that myth is \"falsescience.\" Many, probably most, contemporary folklorists would insist that, regard-less of the actual truth or falsehood of a myth, assuming that to be capable of deter-mination even in principle, the community in which a myth is transmitted tradition-ally regards it to be in some sense true. Given Frazer's assumptions, we can onlyconclude that myths are false explanations that are nonetheless taken to be true, forif they were thought to be false they would no longer be myths. Indeed, this explainsquite well a very common use of the term \"myth\" in contemporary English: for in-stance, if one says, \"It's a myth that you can get AIDS from a handshake.\"3While Frazer's view of myth as false explanation is no longer much adhered to bythose who make it their business to specialize in the study of myth, there are never-theless two points made in this connection that I think should be underscored here:first, that what we term \"myth\" may often have a special relationship to reason, aboveall to reasoned explanation, that neither legend nor folktale generally has; second,that we should attend carefully to the question of the truth-value of myths. An addi-tional point that I shall seek to emphasize in this and the following chapters relates tothe common characterization of myths as narratives concerned with sacred history."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"142 Myth, Memory, ReveIn its explanatory dimension, myth engages reason by disclosing as intelligiblewhat had otherwise seemed mysterious, and by motivating appropriate humanbehavior in the light of what is thus explained, at least whenever the proper order-ing of human agency is part of the mystery to be made intelligible, as it is in manyimportant myths. For example, what we may term the \"myth of our technologicalhubris\" tells a certain community of believers among us that the mystery of muchhuman misery may be understood with reference to humanity's overreachingitself and sacrificing an essential, vitalizing harmony with nature in the courseof a self-defeating and obsessive drive to attain control of nature. Apart fromthe truth or falsehood of any particular claims advanced in this connection, thebeliever may assert that, in the light of this myth, much of human misery isrevealed to be an intelligible phenomenon, and so he or she may be motivated tocontribute to the alleviation of suffering by assisting in the effort to refrain fromand limit our abuse of nature through technology. This, in turn, may or may notrequire that the believer master certain specific information about history or physicalscience.4The same points might just as well be made with reference to traditional mythnarratives. Consider, for example, one of the myths that is told in connection withthe cult of BhatbhatinI, a deified minstrel couple widely worshipped by the Newarsof the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal:Bhatini, like HaritI, had a taste for human flesh. But Visnu, by means of Garuda, seizedone of Bhatini's own beloved brood, restoring it only on the ogress' promise to fore-swear human flesh and to become instead a protector of children. It is apparently inthis role that the blessing of BhatbhatinI is invoked by parents of children thought tobe bewitched or to be suffering from mental or physical disease.5So long as there is a community affirming the authority of this myth, its memberswill continue to propitiate the minstrel couple to alleviate the illnesses of their chil-dren, and they will do so reasonably so long as the myth is not falsified for them inpractice, as it might be if they were to conclude, for instance, that recovery of healthwas notably less likely for children of BhatbhatinI worshipers than among the chil-dren of other Kathmandu Newars. But this would likely be the case only if theirworship precluded their recourse to other treatment, whereas in fact it may just aswell motivate the search for alternatives; the discovery of the right doctor may betaken as a token of the deity's blessing no less than a miracle cure.Reflection upon such relationships between mythic explanation and motivatedaction further calls into question the truth of myths. It may seem that in a certainsense this shows truth to be essentially irrelevant here, that the open-ended potenti-alities for artful interpretation render myth unfalsifiable. The myths that a given com-munity considers authoritative need not be thought to be true in the sense that theyconvey demonstrably true \"factual\" information: mythic matters seem to be moresubtle than the facts of the matter, so that the truth in myth may be thought to beexpressed allegorically, metaphorically or approximatively; or myth may be thoughtjust to orient us towards truth so buried in mystery that no human discourse can dis-close it directly. The truth in myth is thus conceived as veiled and obscure truth, andthis, of course, reinforces for some the conclusion that myths somehow stand out-side of the domain of truth-value altogether."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The Imaginal Persistence of the Empire 143That conclusion, however, I believe to be wrong. For myth-truth, while not fac-tual truth, is perhaps allied to pragmatic truth in something approaching a Jamesiansense.6 A myth is felt to be true whenever it functions in the discourse of a commu-nity to ground action that is itself felt to bring about the success of that community,or of its individual members. It may thus be said to be true to the extent that it is feltby those who yield to its authority to promote ends that are not self-defeating. Thisis very well illustrated by some aspects of the recent disputes within the Tibetancommunity concerning the status of the protective divinity Dorje Shugden, whosecult the Dalai Lama in recent years has sought to ban.7Among the members of the Tibetan business community in Kathmandu, DorjeShugden is widely propitiated as a divine bestower of wealth. Because Tibetans inKathmandu have in fact flourished during the past couple of decades, growing richthrough success in the tourist and crafts-export trades, the Dalai Lama's calls to aban-don the Shugden cult have caused no small degree of consternation: the deity, afterall, appears to be promoting the ends for which he is propitiated. The Dalai Lama,however, regarding matters from a clerical perspective, is more focused upon therole of Shugden as a militantly sectarian protector of the Gelukpa order, and the harmthat has been done to Tibetan sectarian relations by the cult's more vociferous pro-ponents. As sectarian strife appears to undermine the interests of the Tibetan com-munity at large, the Dalai Lama and those who perceive the issue as he does haveconcluded that the cult is now a self-defeating one, and that it should therefore be setaside. This, of course, leaves some of the businesspeople who are supporters of theDalai Lama in a position of inner conflict: their loyalty to their leader requires themto obey him, but at the same time, because they have prospered while worshipingShugden, they find it difficult to accept that this practice has been in any sense self-defeating.Because it is probably impossible to remove the determination of human ends andtheir successful fulfillment entirely from the domain of appearances, myth-truth can-not itself be more than a matter of seeming, but to say this is not to say that truth-value is irrelevant here; for the possibility of self-defeat entails that a myth may bein the course of a community's history revealed to be false to the very communitythat, at an earlier time, had affirmed it. And, as we have now seen, if differing fac-tions within the same community arrive at opposing conclusions about this, the as-sessment of myth may become a cause for sharp division.The truth of myth, then, is essentially tied to a community's history, and suc-cessful mythmakers may be said to know this. For even when, as is the case of thematerials we shall examine in chapters 9 and 10, the time in which the events nar-rated in myth stand outside of historical time, it is nonetheless historical and livedtime—whether some of its particular features or the whole thereof—that is explainedand interpreted through myth. Myth is in this respect metahistorical discourse andso may sometimes emerge as a powerful medium for philosophical and scientificthought: consider here the myths of the state of nature and the social contract inpolitical philosophy since Hobbes, or that of the primal horde in the thought ofFreud.8Myths, therefore, engage our thinking in reason, truth, and history, and so theyexpress and constitute the thinker's vision of these domains, and of the mannerin which they are related to one another. For this reason, it seems to me to be an"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"144 Myth, Memory, Revelationerror to associate mythical thinking too strongly with the \"primitive\" or the\"archaic.\" Mythic discourse, as I understand it here, is part of the essential consti-tution of human discourse, though its precise role and value, and above all the spe-cific manner of its articulation, may vary from one cultural-historical setting toanother.Of course, \"myth,\" as I am using the word here, refers not exclusively to a par-ticular discourse genre, but rather to any discourse that performs functions closelysimilar to those of the paradigmatic myths that do represent a type of narrative. Thisis a derivative way of using the term \"myth,\" and one that I shall continue to employfrom time to time, though it should not be conflated with the more primary significa-tion of the term, which refers to a particular narrative category. In the two cases studiedin the present chapter—the religious traditions that evolved in part from the earlierhistorical accounts of the great emperors Songtsen Gampo (c. 617-649/650) and TrhiSongdetsen (742-c. 797)—epic narratives buttressed a vast corpus of nonnarrativeliterature. These included works on morals, meditation, all sorts of ritual, and Bud-dhist doctrine, that in turn contributed to the ongoing elaborations of the mythicconstructions to which they belonged.The Most Compassionate KingThe Mani bka'- 'bum (Mani Kambum),9 a heterogeneous collection of texts ascribedto King Songtsen Gampo and primarily concerned with the cult of the bodhisattvaMahakarunika-Avalokitesvara, the \"Great Compassionate Avalokitesvara,\"10has enjoyed a singularly long history of study in the West.11 As early as 1801,P. S. Pallas had published an account of its first chapters, and, in 1838, the in-trepid Magyar scholar Alexander Csoma de Koros mentioned it by name amongTibetan historical works, thereby creating the false impression that the ManiKambum might be regarded as such.12 A. I. Vostrikov, writing some one hundredyears later, sought to provide a more accurate assessment of the Mani Kambum,saying that itcontains much interesting material from the point of view of literature and folklore.Its fairly frequent deviations from the dominant views of Tibetan Buddhism are ofgreat interest. As a historical source, however, it is of absolutely no value and cannotbe classed under historical works.13More recently, Ariane Macdonald has reported briefly on her investigations con-cerning the contents and compilation of the Mani Kambum as a prelude to the studyof the legendary biographies of Songtsen Gampo found therein, for, as she observes,it is the historico-legendary aspect of the Mani Kambum that has held the attentionof occidental scholars.14 These aspects of the Mani Kambum have continued to beexamined by Michael Aris and others, and traditions concerning one of the key fig-ures involved in its early compilation, by Anne-Marie Blondeau.15 In the presentsurvey of the Mani Kambum and its allied literature, I emphasize three aspects ofthis important body of material: the history of the Mani Kambum's compilation; itssignificance for the development of a Tibetan worldview; and its peculiar approachto the problems of Buddhist theory and practice."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The Imaginal Persistence of the Empire 145Compiling the TreasuresThe Mani Kambum is usually divided into three \"cycles\" (skor):1. The Cycle of Sutras (mdo-skor), which includes various legendary accounts of theexploits of Avalokitesvara and of King Songtsen Gampo;2. The Cycle of Attainment (sgrub-skor), which contains the meditational \"means forattainment\" (sgrub-thabs, Skt. sadhana) of Avalokitesvara in various aspects; and3. The Cycle of Precepts (zhal-gdams-kyi skor), containing some 150 short texts treat-ing a wide variety of topics, most of which are connected in some way with thesystems of meditation focusing upon Mahakarunika.16Further, there is a small collection of texts, sometimes referred to as the Cycle ofthe Disclosure of the Hidden (gab-pa mngon-phyung gi skor)—after the most re-nowned of the works found therein—which in some redactions of the Mani Kambumis appended to the Cycle of Precepts, and in others forms by itself a fourth cycle, anappendix to the entire collection.17This entire mass of material—usually assembled in two volumes containing about700 folios in all—was discovered as textual treasure (gter-ma) by some three trea-sure-revealers (gter-ston) over a period lasting approximately one century, begin-ning, it appears, in the middle of the twelfth. The Fifth Dalai Lama, Ngawang LozangGyatso (1617-1682), himself a great contributor to the tradition of revealed trea-sures,18 has summarized its compilation in these words:The dharma-protecting king Songtsen Gampo taught the doctrinal cycles (chos-skor)of Mahakarunika to disciples endowed with [appropriate propensities owing to theirown past] actions and fortunate circumstances19 and had the cycles set down in writ-ing. The Great Chronicle (Lo-rgyus chen-mo), which comes from the Cycle of Sutras,was concealed together with the Cycle of Attainment and the Cycle of Precepts be-neath the feet of Hayagriva, in the northern quarter of the central hall [in the LhasaJo-khang temple].20 Some, including the Disclosure of the Hidden and [the remain-ing portions of] the Cycle of Sutras, were concealed in the right thigh of theyaksa Naga-Kubera, beneath the hem of his gown.21 The glorious and great Orgyen[Padmasambhava] clearly revealed them to Lord Trhi Songdetsen, saying, \"Yourown ancestor Songtsen Gampo has concealed such treasures in Ra-sa [Lhasa].\"Thereupon, [the king] gained faith and made the Means for the Attainment of theThousand-fold Mahakarunika, the Disclosure of the Hidden, the Creation and Con-summation of the Thousand Buddhas, the Benefits of Beholding {Songtsen Gampo's\\Spiritual Bond [that is, the Jowo Sakyamuni image of Lhasa], and Songtsen's LastTestament into [his own] spiritual bonds.22Later, the siddha Ngodrap—a yogin who was taken into the following of Maha-karunika [by the deity himself],23 and who lived in the human world for about 300years—drew forth the Cycle of Attainment from beneath the feet of the Hayagriva inthe northern quarter of the central hall and transmitted it to Lord Nyangfrel NyimaOzer, 1124-1192],24 the incarnation of Tshangpa Lheimetog [King Trhi Songdetsen].Lord [Nyang] brought the Cycle of Precepts out from beneath the feet of Hayagriva.Shakyawo, [who is also known as Shakya] Zangpo, a teacher from Lhasa in the cen-tral province, [later] brought forth the Cycle of Sutras, as well as the Disclosure of theHidden and so on, from the yafcsa-shrine. So it was that this doctrinal cycle had"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"146 Myth, Memory, Revelationthree discoverers. Nonetheless, it is renowned as the treasure of the venerable siddhaNgodrup, for he was foremost [among them]. For that reason, I have not here written[about the Mani Kambum] in the sections devoted to the doctrinal cycles of the othertwo treasure-discoverers but have placed [all their discoveries belonging to the ManiKambum] together at this juncture.25The Great Fifth later reinforces his case for insisting upon the preeminence of thesiddha Ngodrup among the revealers of the Mani Kambum. Speaking of the GreatChronicle he tells us that the location in which it was concealed (gter-gnas, that is,under the feet of the Hayagrlva image) suggests it to have been among the treasuresdiscovered by Ngodrup.26 The attribution of the Cycle of Sutras to Shakyawo, then,must refer to only four of the remaining texts in that section.27 The Dalai Lama doesnot mention that one of the texts forming the Mani Kambum, the Great Explana-tory Commentary, the colophon of which clearly attributes its discovery to Ngodrupand which belongs to the Cycle of Attainment, also refers explicitly to the GreatChronicled His hypothesis that the discovery of this latter text, or perhaps an ear-lier version thereof, preceded Shaky awo's discoveries may be cautiously accepted.In sum, then, the siddha Ngodrup would seem to have discovered the originalkernel of the Mani Kambum, consisting of a version of the Great Chronicle, the GreatExplanatory Commentary, and at least three other texts included in the Cycle of Attain-ment, which are explicitly referred to in the Commentary.29 It is by no means im-probable that this treasure-revealer also disclosed at least some of the remainingworks of the Cycle of Attainment as well, though the evidence on this point isinconclusive.There is perhaps no reason to contradict the tradition that Nyangrel Nyima Ozerincreased this original body of material with the discovery of the Cycle of Precepts.30More problematic, however, is the contribution of Shakyawo, who, as a student ofNyang's disciple Mikyo Dorje of Lato, probably belongs to the early or mid-thirteenthcentury.31 One text from the Cycle of the Disclosure of the Hidden is clearly attrib-uted to him, the colophon of which states that it is but one of several works discov-ered together.32 The opinion of the Great Fifth concerning his contribution to the Cycleof Sutras has already been referred to here. Beyond that, I can only note that I haveso far found no evidence that would render it impossible to ascribe the entire Cycleof the Disclosure of the Hidden, as well as the four works in the Cycle of Sutrasmentioned by the Fifth Dalai Lama, to the age of Shakyawo. It is certainly possiblethat the great majority of the texts presently included in the Mani Kambum were inexistence by about 1250, though their present arrangement, in the form of a singlecollection, may still be the product of a later generation.33The tale of the recovery of the works forming the Mani Kambum has few varia-tions, reflecting the fact that most of the Tibetan historians who wrote on this topicprobably did so with one and the same catalogue (dkar-chag) before them.34 The mostsignificant variation I have encountered is found in the writings of the learned JonangJetsiin Taranatha (1575-1634), who states:The means for the attainment of the deity35 [found in] the Collected Works of the King[Rgyal-po bka'- 'bum] and the roots of the precepts36 appear, certainly, to have beencomposed by the religious-king Songtsen Gampo. Therefore, they are the actual wordsof Arya Avalokita37 and are really the ancient ancestral religion38 of Tibet itself. It is"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The Imagined Persistence of the Empire 147well known that they were concealed as treasures by master Padma[sambhava]. More-over, the history and most of the ancillary texts were composed by the treasure-discoverer, siddha Ngodrup, by Nyangrel, and by others.39While this statement is of great interest for its critical, but not condemnatory,view of the Mani Kambum as revealed treasure—as for its assertion that it wasPadmasambhava, and not Songtsen Gampo, who concealed the portions Taranatharegards as being indeed ancient—it does not otherwise alter our conception of thehistory of the Mani Kambum's compilation as outlined earlier.40Finally, we should note that it is not exactly clear when it was that this collectionreceived the name Mani Kambum, save that it was universally known as such nolater than the seventeenth century.41 Elsewhere, it is entitled the Collected Works ofthe Dharma Protecting King Songtsen Gampo,42 and even the Doctrinal Cycle Con-cerning the Six-Syllable [mantra] of Mahakarunika.43 The meditational system itembodies is usually referred to as that of Avalokitesvara According to the System ofthe King,44 a phrase attested as early as the first half of the fourteenth century, whenwe find Karmapa III Rangjung Dorje (1284-1339) conferring its empowerment onthe great Nyingmapa master, Longchen Rabjampa (1308-1363).45Cosmology and MythThe mythical portions of the Mani Kambum develop a distinctive view of Tibet, itshistory, and its place in the world. Three elements that inform this view are outstand-ing: the belief that Avalokitesvara was the patron deity of Tibet; the legend of KingSongtsen Gampo and his court, in which the king is represented as being the veryembodiment of Avalokitesvara, the founder of the Buddha's way in his formerlybarbarian realm; and the cosmological vision of the Tibetan Avalokitesvara cult,whereby the king's divinity, and the divinity's regard for Tibet, are seen not as mat-ters of historic accident, but as matters grounded in the very nature of the world.Though all were, at least in rough versions, current by the time the Mani Kambummade its appearance, they were much elaborated and achieved their definite articu-lation within the Mani Kambum itself.1. Following the Mani Kambum and related sources, later Tibetan historians havetended to assign the inception of the Avalokitesvara cult in Tibet to the reign ofSongtsen Gampo.46 Thus, for example, one of the Gelukpa masters we met in thepreceding chapter, Thuken Choki Nyima (1737-1802):At first, the religious king Songtsen Gampo taught the Creation and Consum-mation of Mahakarunika (Thugs-rje-chen-po'i bskyed-rdzogs) and other pre-cepts at length, and there were many who practiced them, too. It was at firstfrom this, that [the custom] spread throughout Tibet and Kham of praying toArya Avalokita and reciting the six-syllable [mantra Om Manipadme Hum].41In addition to acting as a teacher in his own right, the king is said to have encouragedand sponsored the establishment of shrines and images, as well as the translation intoTibetan of the fundamental texts of the Indian Avalokitesvara tradition. The spiri-tual activity begun by Songtsen Gampo was then continued on a vast scale by hisdescendant Trhi Songdetsen.48"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"148 Myth, Memory, RevelationContemporary Tibetanists have tended to be skeptical about such traditions. Theypoint to the inconclusive evidence within the most ancient historical sources on thesubject of Songtsen Gampo' s actual commitment to Buddhism, and the near absenceof manuscript evidence from Dunhuang of a widespread cult of Avalokitesvara inTibet prior to the eleventh century.49 At the same time, the known history of the trans-lation of Sanskrit and Chinese Buddhism into Tibetan does establish that canonicaltexts of fundamental importance for this cult were available in Tibetan by 812 or824, the probable years of the compilation of the Denkar catalogue (Ldan-kar-ma)of Buddhist texts.50 One may note, too, that the \"oral precept\" tradition (Gsung bka'-md) of the Nyingmapa school, which purports to represent an unbroken lineagetransmitting teachings that were introduced into Tibet primarily during the reignof Trhi Songdetsen and which likely does include some authentically ancient ma-terial, accords scant attention to Avalokitesvara. It is, rather, with the recovery ofthe revealed treasure texts, above all the Mani Kambum, that the great bodhisattvaassumes a role of considerable importance for the Nyingmapas.51 Finally, we shouldremark that, even among those Tibetan historians who are inclined to accept thevalidity of the Mani Kambum and related traditions, there are those who see evi-dence in it not of a flourishing Avalokitesvara cult in ancient Tibet, but rather of asecret transmission from Songtsen Gampo to a small number of worthy adepts,family members, and courtiers, who did not, in turn, transmit the king's teachingsto a subsequent generation.52 In short, the available evidence powerfully suggeststhat, while early medieval Tibet had some familiarity with the bodhisattva, the cultof Avalokitesvara, as known to a later age, is a product not of the imperial periodbut of the \"later spread of the doctrine\" (bstan-pa phyi-dar) that began in the latetenth century.There can be little doubt that the first great figure to actively promote thepractice of meditational techniques focusing on Avalokitesvara was Dlpamkara-SrTjnana, better known as Atisa (982-1054, and in Tibet from 1042 onwards). Threemajor systems of instruction (khrid) on the rites and meditations of Avalokitesvaramay be traced back to this Bengali master.53 During the latter part of the eleventhcentury and the beginning of the twelfth, several other systems were propoundedby Bari Lotsawa (b. 1040), by the siddhas Candradhvaja and Tshembupa, and byMilarepa's famous disciple Rechung Dorjetrak (b. 1084).54 The works familiar tome that relate to these systems do not make it clear whether or not these mastersregarded Tibet to be Avalokitesvara's special field. But the following passage,attributed to the emanation of the Great Mother, Macik Labdron (1055-1145 or1153), and thus possibly belonging to the very period we are considering, is of muchinterest in this connection:I have made both Avalokitesvara and Bhattarika-Tara into special doctrines thatare universally renowned. It also appears that the two are our common Tibetanancestors, and in that they are certainly our \"divine portion\" (lha-skal), infantslearn to recite the six syllables at the very same time that they are beginning tospeak; this is a sign that the Exalted One has actually blessed their spirits. Thus,it is truly right for us all to make of the Exalted One our \"divine portion.\"55The tone of advocacy here is noteworthy. Are we reading too much between thelines if we see here a slight suggestion that Tibetans during the early twelfth cen-tury still required arguments that they did, indeed, have a special relationship with"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Imaginal Persistence of the Empire 149the ever compassionate Avalokitesvara? During the later part of the same century,the Great Chronicle of the Mani Kambum is able to state the case with far greaterassurance—as in this passage, addressed to Avalokitesvara by the dying BuddhaSakyamuni:There are none left to be trained by me. Because there are none for me to trainI will demonstrate the way of nirvana to inspire those who are slothful to thedoctrine and to demonstrate that what is compounded is impermanent. Thesnowy domain to the north [Tibet] is presently a domain of animals, so eventhe word \"human being\" does not exist there—it is a vast darkness. And allwho die there turn not upwards but, like snowflakes falling on a lake, dropinto the world of evil destinies. At some future time, when that doctrine de-clines, you, O bodhisattva, will train them. First, the incarnation of a bod-hisattva will generate human beings who will require training. Then, they willbe brought together [as disciples] by material goods [zang-zing]. After that,bring them together through the doctrine! It will be for the welfare of livingbeings!56So there can be no longer any doubt that the bodhisattva has been assigned to Tibetby the Buddha himself. To the assertion that the Snowy Land is Avalokitesvara'sspecial field, the Mani Kambum has lent a semblance of canonical authority.2. Let us turn now to the legend of King Songtsen Gampo' s having been an incarna-tion of Avalokitesvara. Ariane Macdonald, in her superb study of the royal religionof this king, has argued that his religion, based in large measure on indigenous Ti-betan beliefs, was most certainly not Buddhism.57 The belief that the king was, infact, the bodhisattva seems then to reflect the opinion of a later age, no doubt one inwhich the growing community of Tibetan Buddhists sought to reinforce the prece-dent for its own presence in the Land of Snows.58 In this, of course, it goes hand inhand with the myth of the bodhisattva's role as Tibet's spiritual patron. Like this lattermyth, the time of the former's origin cannot be established with great precision; whenit makes its first datable appearance in 1167—which is probably close to the time ofits appearance in the Great Chronicle as well—it is presented without reservationsas established history.59It is in the narrative portions of the Mani Kambum that the simple tale of the in-carnate king is richly developed, so that his court becomes a veritable Tibetan Camelot.Further, it is in the form of an elaborate romance that the legend of Songtsen Gampois restated repeatedly, in works like the apocryphal Bka'-chems ka-khol-ma (TheTestament Drawn from a Pillar) and the semihistorical Rgyal-rabs gsal-ba'i me-long(The Mirror Clarifying the Royal Geneology).60 In this literature, including the ManiKambum, in which the myth of Avalokitesvara's guiding role throughout the courseof Tibetan history is developed, a distinct unifying theme emerges: the bodhisattvanow functions as a deus ex machina of sorts, making benign incursions onto theTibetan landscape at various critical junctures.

The doc-trinal foundation is established.61It was during this same period that the custom of propagating the cult of Avalo-kitesvara at public assemblies (khrom-chos) seems to have begun, for by the secondhalf of the thirteenth century no less a hierarch than the renowned Karma Pakshi (seechapter 6) composed a rite for just that purpose.62What was the result of Avalokitesvara's ascension to a position of such centralimportance in the Tibetan world, particularly during a period of grave political un-rest?63 There can be little doubt that the myth of the religious king did much to sup-port the notion that worldly affairs might best be placed in the hands of essentiallyspiritual leaders. And it is possible, too, that the Tibetan people came to expect theirtemporal woes to be set aright as before, by the timely intercession of the greatbodhisattva. Can it be any wonder, then, that when Tibet finally achieved somemeasure of real unity during the seventeenth century—after almost eight centuriesof intermittent strife—it did so under the leadership of a latter-day emanation ofMahakarunika residing in the ancient capital of Lhasa, and constructing for himselfa hilltop palace named after the divine Mount Potalaka? It seems we are in the pres-ence of a Tibetan twist on the Arthurian legend, whereby the once and future kingbecomes at long last the king, once and present.3. The Mani Kambum' s view of Avalokitesvara' s role in Tibetan history and, in par-ticular, his manifestation as Songtsen Gampo, develops, as we have seen, themeswhose general features had been well defined by the time the first sections of thecollection appeared. More eclectic in their formation, and thus more resistant to ef-forts to understand their evolution, are the cosmology and theogony of the ManiKambum.The notion that Avalokitesvara might be regarded as the primordial deity, the pointof departure for a unique theogony, was introduced into Tibet no later than the ninthcentury with the translation into Tibetan of the Karandavyuha-sutra (The Sutra ofthe Cornucopia of Avalokitesvara's Attributes), though the theogonic theme is but"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Imaginal Persistence of the Empire 151slightly developed therein.64 The same sutra presents also a vision of Avalokitesvarain which each pore of the bodhisattva's body is seen to embrace whole world sys-tems, a vision that was later said to have been taught by Atisa in connection with theprecepts of the Four Gods of the Kadampas (Bka'-gdams lha-bzhi).65In the Great Chronicle, Avalokitesvara undergoes a tremendous evolution. Thoughpresented there as the emanation of the Buddha Amitabha, it is the bodhisattva whoseown body gives rise to the thousand cakravartin kings and the thousand Buddhas ofthe Bhadrakalpa, just as the body of the Avalokitesvara of the Karandavyuha-sutrahad given birth to the brahmanical pantheon.66 Moreover, the Karandavyuha'& vi-sion of the deity is now amplified by a cosmological vision widely associated in Tibetwith ih&Avatamsakasutra (The Sutra of the Bounteousness of the Buddhas), but withAvalokitesvara here occupying a position even prior to that of the cosmic BuddhaVairocana.67 It is, moreover, a novel sense of Tibet's station in the universe thatconstitutes the most striking innovation:[After Amitabha] had empowered the best of bodhisattvas, Arya Avalokitesvara,to benefit living beings, an inconceivable and immeasurable light radiated forthfrom his body and magically created (sprul) many fields of the buddhas' bodyof rapture (sambhogakaya) in which he magically created many buddhas of thebody of rapture. So it was that he benefited many sentient beings.And from the hearts of those bodies of rapture, there radiated forth incon-ceivably many fields of emanational bodies (nirmanakaya) in which were magi-cally created many emanationally embodied buddhas; and from the hearts ofthose emanational bodies, light radiated forth, which was ineffable and beyondbeing ineffable.68 From that light Arya Avalokitesvaras, Bhrkutls, and Taraswere magically created equal to the number of sentient beings. So, too, did hebenefit living creatures.Again, light emanated from his body and he magically created many worldsystems, as many as there are atoms in the substance of the world system that isthe \"middle array.\"69 And in them the innumerable Tathagatas magically ema-nated forth to an equal number, whereby he again benefited sentient beings.Then from their bodies, there radiated forth light rays, which were immea-surable and beyond being immeasurable.70 At [the tip of] each one there wasmagically created a Jambudvipa, in each of which was a Vajrasana. To the northof each Vajrasana there was a land beyond the pale, which was a Land of Snows,[and in each of these there was] a supreme horse who was a destroyer of armies,71an eleven-faced Avalokitesvara, and a Tara, and a Bhrkutl. In each one, KingSongtsen Gampo and the venerable ladies, white and green, were magically cre-ated.72 Ineffable light rays poured forth from their bodies and they magicallycreated Mahakarunikas and six-syllable mantras equal to the number of sen-tient beings. Thus they benefited living creatures.73The enlightened activity of Avalokitesvara, his incursion into Tibetan history in theform of King Songtsen Gampo, is no longer an event occurring within the Tibetanhistorical framework. Rather, Tibet itself is now an aspect of the bodhisattva's all-pervading creative activity. How could the Buddha's teaching have been artificiallyimplanted in such a realm, the very existence of which is evidence of the Buddha'scompassionate engagement in the world?

It is clear that the impulse toexplain events in the external world is a consideration of but little importancehere. The aim of the Mani Kambum's cosmology is, rather, to propagate the cult ofMahakarunika and his six-syllable mantra—to demonstrate that this is the most effi-cacious spiritual practice in this debased age, particularly for the Tibetan people. Itis a measure of the emphasis of the Mani Kambum that merely one-third of its totalvolume is concerned with the themes we have been considering thus far, the remain-ing two-thirds being wholly devoted to the exposition of a unique system of medita-tion, which is developed throughout the Cycle of Attainment, the Cycle of Precepts,and the Cycle of the Disclosure of the Hidden. While many aspects of Buddhist"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Imaginal Persistence of the Empire 153metaphysics, psychology, and ritual are referred to and commented upon in thesecycles, the Mani Kambum by and large eschews speculative philosophy and the elabo-ration of a systematic psychology. Hence, with the exception of the formal rites forthe worship of and meditation upon the deity (sddhana, sgrub-thabs), which areaccorded a fairly well-established pattern of exposition such as is required by thestructure of sadhana itself, the doctrinal portions of the Mani Kambum exhibit muchfreedom in their development. Not confined by a single system, the Mani Kambumutilizes a variety of systems, calling upon them when they are needed to advance ateaching that, we are told, lies beyond them all.74 These instructions that are placedin the mouth of Songtsen Gampo touch upon such diverse topics as the nine succes-sive vehicles,75 the two truths,76 the Great Seal, or Mahamudra,77 Great Perfection,78the sequence of the path,79 the trio of ground, path, and result,80 the trio of view,meditation, and action,81 the three bodies of buddhahood,82 et cetera. But none ofthese topics is ever allowed to ascend to the position of becoming a central leitmotifthat would unify, to some extent, the Mani Kambum's diverse contents. Of this, theMani Kambum is itself conscious. The catalogue of contents (dkar-chag) tells us thatthese precepts \"are not all dependent on one another. They are 'magical fragmentsof instruction'83—each one benefits a particular individual.\"84The peculiar term \"magical fragment,\" which so appropriately describes the ManiKambum's many short precepts, is itself the subject of a detailed definition found inthe Great Explanatory Commentary:\"Magical fragments\" are so called because, just as magic appears variously butis without substantial existence (rang-bzhin med-pa), so too this doctrine of Maha-karunika is explained and taught by various means and in various aspects (thabs yan-lag sna-tshogs-su bshad) but nonetheless remains the same in that it is an indivisibleunion of emptiness and compassion. \"Fragment\" means that each particular divisionof the doctrine suffices as the occasion for the particular development of [spiritual]experience [by a given] individual.85So the many doctrines referred to by the Mani Kambum all serve to illustrate thesingle doctrine of Mahakarunika and are thus the basis for an exposition of the cen-tral doctrines of the Mahayana, those of compassion and emptiness, which, thoughthey are indivisible as aspects of the play of enlightened awareness, must nonethe-less be distinguished conventionally. It is from such a perspective that the catalogueof contents endeavors to summarize the teaching of the Mani Kambum:[H]owever many precepts associated with the doctrines of provisional meaning (drang-don-gyi chos-kyi zhal-gdams) are expounded, they are not the doctrines of Maha-karunika unless you have deliberately taken up sentient beings, having seized theground with loving kindness and compassion. If, because you fear the sufferings ofsamsara, you desire freedom, desire bliss, desire liberation for yourself alone and thuscannot create an enlightened attitude for the sake of sentient beings, then these arenot the doctrines of the bodhisattva Avalokita. If you do not practice for the sake ofall living beings, you will not realize Avalokitesvara... .However many doctrines of definitive meaning (nges-don gyi chos) are expounded,you must recognize the true Mahakarunika, Reality itself (chos-nyid-don-gyi thugs-rje chen-po), mind-as-such, which is empty and is the buddhas' body of reality (dhar-makaya), to be within yourself (rang-la yod-pa).

If you desire to attain some Mahakarunika who \"dwells in his properabode,\"86 or desire to behold his visage, or to attain the accomplishments (siddhi,dngos-grub), you will be granted the common accomplishments but will stray far fromthe supreme accomplishment, buddhahood.87It appears that, in its emphasis on the union of compassion and emptiness, theteaching of the Mani Kambum is inspired by the eleventh-century renewal of inter-est in the path of the Mahayana sutras, particularly as developed in the instructionsof the Kadampa school.88 But in its discussion of \"the true Mahakarunika, Realityitself,\" that is, in its discussion of \"doctrines of definitive meaning,\" the diction ofthe Mani Kambum becomes decidedly that of the Nyingmapa tradition—for example,in its identification of Mahakarunika, Supreme Compassion, with \"the play of intui-tive awareness and continuous, fresh gnosis.\"89 These doctrinal orientations may beillustrated by a short collection of instructions, taught by the king to his daughterTrhompagyen, the \"adornment of the town\":The view of Supreme Compassion is the indivisible union of appearance andemptiness, and is like the sky.External appearances, the incessant appearing of whatever may be, arenonetheless the appearance of mind, self-manifest.The essential character of mind is that it is empty.And the essential character of appearance is that it is empty; for it is apparent,but without substantial existence.The meditation of Supreme Compassion is like the indivisible union of clarityand emptiness and is like a rainbow appearing in the sky.You must cultivate the realization that the essential character of mind, which isclear and unobscured, and which emerges by itself, arises by itself, is that itis empty.The action of Supreme Compassion is the indivisible union of awareness andemptiness, and is like the sun rising in the sky.Action is freedom from hankering after whatever there is that arises incessantlyin mind, whose nature is pure awareness.Though you act, you act in emptiness, not grasping at entities as real.The fruit of Supreme Compassion is the indivisible union of bliss andemptiness.Mind itself, without contrivances, is blissful within the expanse that is thefoundation of all that is real.Being empty and free from grasping, it is like the moon reflected in water.Being free from all superimposed limits, it is without features that serve todefine it.And because it has ever been present within you, it cannot be achieved.The spiritual commitment of Supreme CompassionIs emptiness whose core is compassion.Its characteristic being just that,You'll grasp all living beings in all three realmsWith unqualified compassion.Being equal, you will act without \"levels.\""},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Imaginal Persistence of the Empire 155The enlightened activity of Supreme CompassionGrasps beings with a snare of compassion in whichBuddhas and sentient beings are no different.It slaughters their pain with the weapon of emptiness,And draws sentient beings to the level of bliss supreme.90While the great variety of the Mani Kambum's teachings of doctrine and ritualand the unsystematic way in which these topics are, for the most part, presented, donot permit us to define too strictly a \"central doctrine\" in this case, the teaching ofthe Mani Kambum represents, by and large, a syncretic approach to the doctrines ofthe Nyingmapas and those of the Avalokitesvara traditions of the new translationschools, particularly the Kadampa, with its emphasis upon \"emptiness imbued withcompassion.\"91 Further, through the instructions on the visualization and mantra ofAvalokitesvara transmitted by masters of all the major Tibetan Buddhist schools, aswell as by lay tantric adepts and itinerant mani-pas—\"Ommanipadmehumists\"—whopreached the bodhisattva' s cult far and wide, it was this syncretic teaching that be-came, for all intents and purposes, Tibet's devotional norm.92The Advent of the Lotus GuruIf there is a figure in the Tibetan pantheon whose popularity rivals the ubiquitouscult of Avalokitesvara, surely it is Padmasambhava, the Lotus-Born Precious Guru(Guru Rinpoche). Indeed, the two in many respects have tended to reinforce oneanother and may be considered virtual twins. Padmasambhava, like Avalokitesvara,is an emanation of the buddha Amitabha, and Tibet is his special field. Both arestrongly associated with Tibet's glory days under the old empire. The tales of theircompassionate intercession in the Tibetan world are elaborated in epic narratives thatwere discovered as revealed treasures (gter-ma), and in the early development of thisliterature the twelfth-century treasure-finder Nyangrel Nyima Ozer and his succes-sor, Guru Chowang (1212-1270), emerge as central figures for the formation of bothcults.93 The most striking disanalogy between the two (besides the fact that one issupposed to be a cosmic bodhisattva and the other an historical individual), is thatwhereas we know that Avalokitesvara was an important figure in the Indian Bud-dhist pantheon, whose following had come to extend throughout much of Asia longbefore Buddhism ever became established in Tibet, nothing similar can be said ofPadmasambhava. Indeed, the evidence for him prior to his twelfth-century apotheo-sis in the gter-ma traditions is so thin that some have been inclined to regard him asa rather late Tibetan invention.94 We shall therefore retrace here some of the groundwe have already covered, following now the course whereby the Lotus Guru emergedfrom the margins of the old Tibetan empire to become, in effect, the royal master ofthe Tibetan people as a whole.95According to the tradition of the Testament ofBa, repeated with considerable elabo-ration in later histories, the local deities and spirits of Tibet so obstructed the foun-dation of the temple at Samye that the intervention of occult power in the service ofBuddhism was deemed essential.

Do not allow conduct to slip into the sphere of the view,for, if you do, it will become antinomian [lit. 'no virtue, no sin']. That nihilistic viewhaving arisen, there's no correcting it. But if you permit the view to follow in the wayof conduct, becoming bound up in superficialities, you'll not be liberated. Thesemantras of mine, which are allied to the mind (sems-phyogs), are very great in respectto their view. In the future, there will be many who will be confident about the wordsbut will not have acquired confidence in the application of that view to the mind-stream,and they will descend to infernal births. Some exceptional persons, however, who willnot have broken up view and conduct, will come to benefit many beings. But because,owing to the contrivances of ordinary persons, there will be many variations, the bless-ing will decline and there will be few who are realized. So if I conceal all these thatare not corrupted, in the future they will serve well some who have a karmic connec-tion.\" Saying this, he hid many books in a clay pot. Having bestowed upon the Tsenpothe sequence of empowerment, he granted the transmission of the secret mantras ofthe Mahayana. After explaining the Phur-bu 'bum-sde (The Hundred Thousand [Verse]Tantra of Vajraklla),97 he placed the other esoteric precepts, with prayers, in theAkanistha heaven:\"I pray that I and my patrons, whosoever,In this lifetime and wherever we are born,Practice the fruitional Mahayana of Yoga,In that sacred realm called Akanistha.\"Having so spoken, he departed without completing what remained of the /zoma-ritual[that had been begun earlier].98Towards the end of the Testament ofBa, when Trhi Songdetsen enters into retire-ment, the master Vimalamitra arrives in Tibet and the emperor receives from himthe remaining teachings of Padmasambhava that he had not obtained earlier. Thesehe practices as his personal way of meditation.99The account that we find here represents, no doubt, a version of the tale ofPadmasambhava's visit to the king, developed in the century or so after the eventsit recounts but prior to the massive elaborations of the twelfth century and after;these elaborations begin, so far as we now know, primarily in works authored orrediscovered by Nyangrel Nyima Ozer.100 Given the fact that the Garland ofViews was certainly in circulation and accepted by some as a genuine work ofPadmasambhava before the mid-eleventh century,101 we may posit that the greatguru's cult began its ascent during the obscure period between the fall of the em-pire and the late-tenth-century renaissance. This finds some support in the coupleof references to Padmasambhava known from the pre-eleventh-century documentsfound at Dunhuang, both of which may well date to the postimperial period.102An important tantric cycle of the Nyingmapa school that came under fire in latertimes is that of the wrathful deity Vajraklla (Rdo-rje phur-pd), the Vajra Spike orDagger. Vajraklla embodies the ritual tent peg or spike (ktla, often referred to in"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"158 Myth, Memory, RevelationEnglish as a \"magic dagger\") through whose power the place of practice is, literallyor metaphorically, staked out and so rendered safe from harmful interference andobstacles.103 For the later Nyingmapa traditions, including those handed down withinthe Khon family, which in the eleventh century founded the Sakyapa school, thiswas to be one of the most popular and widespread cults, generating an enormousritual and exegetical literature, together with elaborate rites of dance, exorcism, yoga,et cetera.104The ritual traditions of Vajraklla are represented in the Dunhuang documents inPT 44, a small manuscript preserved at the Bibliotheque nationale in Paris, and inseveral smaller fragments.105 The manuscript PT44 is in most respects rather crude,and one can well imagine that it emanates from a source outside of monastic ortho-doxy. There is no positive indication of its source of origin, however, or of the dateof its production.106 Its opening chapter reads as follows:At first, there was the journey from Yang-la-shod in Nepal to the temple of Nalandain India in order to fetch the Phur-bu 'i 'bum-sde (The Hundred Thousand [Verse]Tantra of Vajraklla): when the Nepali porters Shag-kya-spur and I-so were hired andsent off, there was a tetrad of Bse goddesses who, at about nightfall, killed everyoneand stole their breath. Padmasambhava became short-tempered, made as if to steal[their] breath, and caught them as they were wondering where to flee. Then he putthem in his hat and departed. Arriving at Nalanda, he opened his hat and an exceed-ingly pretty woman appeared in the flesh. When she vowed to be a protectrice for thepractice of the Kila, he empowered her as its protectrice. Because the prognostica-tions were fine, he laughed, offered up a whole handful of gold dust, and then broughtforth the Hundred Thousand [Verse} Tantra of Vajraklla. After arriving at Yang[-la]-shod in Nepal [with it] he performed the practices belonging [to all the classes of yoga]from the general Kriya up through Atiyoga. He proclaimed each and every transmis-sion of the Kila, for the purposes of all the vehicles, from the Hundred Thousand[Verse] Tantra of Vajraklla, as [is affirmed] in all the secret tantras. In that way, hav-ing definitively established the transmissions concerning attainment, and having againescorted the Hundred Thousand [back to Nepal], Acarya Sambhava then performedthe rites of attainment in the Asura cave with the Newari Ser-po, Indra-shu-gu-ta, Pra-be-se, and others. And thus he performed the rites, impelling the four Bse goddesses,whose embodied forms had not passed away. He named them Great Sorceress of OuterSplendor, Miraculous Nourisher, Great Witch Bestowing Glory, and Life-GrantingConjuress. Having performed the great attainment for seven days, he manifestly be-held the visage of Vajrakumara [the Adamant Youth, an epithet of Vajraklla].Having acquired the accomplishment of the Kila, concerning [his attainment of]the signs, Padmasambhava, having set a limitless forest ablaze, thrust [the Kila] atthe blaze. Srigupta, having struck it at the rock in the region of the frontier forest ofIndia, broke the rock into four fragments and thus \"thrust it at stone.\" The NewariSer-po thrust it at water and so reversed the water's course, thereby establishingNepal itself as a mercantile center. Such were the miraculous abilities and powers thatemerged.107In Tibet Acarya Sambhava explained it to Pagor Vairocana and Tse Jnanasukha.Later Dre Tathagata and Buna Ana heard it and practiced at the cave of Samye Rockat Drakmar. Dre Tathagata thrust it at fire. Buna thrust it at the Rock of Hepo. Thenthe glory of the Kila came to Chim Sakya and Nanam Zhang Dorje-nyen. Then it wasexplained to Jin Yeshe-tsek."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Imaginal Persistence of the Empire 159The trio of Yeshe-tsek, Nyen Nyiwa Tsenbapel, and Demen Gyeltshen success-fully practiced at Nyengong in Lhodrak.

Thrust-ing it thus, and displaying the signs, they attained it while maintaining the appear-ance of secrecy. Teaching it as a method for those who would follow, they conferredthe mantra and transmission together.108This text offers little hint of the later destiny of the cult it describes, for Vajrakllacertainly ranks among the most widely propitiated of the tutelary divinities. Never-theless, it seems continuous with later tradition in a number of highly suggestive ways.These include its emphasis on the role of Padmasambhava and the assignment of theinception of his involvement in the Vajraklla cult to the period of his meditation inthe cave of Yanglesho, near modern Pharping, a town to the south of the KathmanduValley.109 Its tale of four goddesses, Padmasambhava's scattering of gold dust, theepisode of the porterage of the texts relating to Vajraklla from India, and the marvel-ous powers attributed to its adepts—all are among the features of the account that, inone form or another, are preserved in the later traditions as well.110What do these relatively early texts tell us of the beginnings of the cult of Padma-sambhava? I believe that, if we accept in general the historical veracity of only themost plausible of the circumstances recounted in these tales, matters begin to comeinto focus. The two elements I should like to emphasize are: first, that part of thetradition of the Testament ofBa, according to which Padmasambhava did visit cen-tral Tibet at the time of the foundation of Samye, perhaps meeting there with the king,whether or not he actually instructed him;1l1 second, the affirmations of the Vajrakllamanuscript to the effect that Padmasambhava was a charismatic tantric master witha following in Nepal and a growing group of disciples in southern Tibet, that is, inthe regions of Drakmar and Lhodrak, down to Bumthang in what is today Bhutan. Inshort, in the early legends of Padmasambhava we may perhaps discern the recollec-tion of a popular eighth-century guru who met with a king, rather like those amongcontemporary Buddhist teachers who have attracted large followings and on one occa-sion or another have met with leading political figures. From this perspective it be-comes possible to imagine that the several lineages of lay tantric practitioners thatduring the late tenth and early eleventh centuries traced their antecedents back toPadmasambhava, and that were devoted to the cult of Vajraklla, would have laid greatstress upon the royal meeting, whatever the facts of the matter may have been, as thisno doubt strengthened their sense of legitimacy and authority. Once these older tantriclineages started to come under attack by proponents of the newer lines of tantrism beingintroduced from India from the late tenth century onwards, the tendency would havebeen to insist increasingly upon recollections of Padmasambhava's imperial connec-tion, thereby reinforcing the ancient tradition against the upstart claims of the new teach-ings. Padmasambhava, a marginal Dharma master of the eighth century, in this wayreemerged two centuries later as an emblem of Tibet's imperial greatness, and a heroto a wide network of tantric cults that had taken root and flourished during this time.112In the preceding chapter, I argued that the phenomenon of the rediscovered trea-sures in Tibet must be understood in terms of the authority of the past, the concep-tion of a lost golden age whose retrieval came to be valued over progressive discov-ery. Beyond this, there was at the same time a need felt to reassert past tradition inthe face of foreign novelty, while appropriating innovation under the description of"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"160 Myth, Memory, Revelationwhat was past. The apotheosis of Padmasambhava must be seen in this light, for hewas at once ancient hero and foreign presence. However indistinctly, we may thusbegin to discern how it was that he became the definitive signifier of the entire trea-sure phenomenon.Hierarchy and UniversalityThe Tibetan cults of Avalokitesvara and Padmasambhava, and indeed the entire trea-sure tradition with which they are intertwined, are in interesting respects at once bothhierarchical and antihierarchical. The dialectic between these two apparently opposedtendencies offers, I think, a valuable key to their interpretation. They explicitly sharea common allegiance to the hierarchical order of the Tibetan empire of the seventhto the ninth centuries,113 and thus implicitly, and sometimes explicity as well, theycall into question the credentials of the various hegemonic orders that arose in Tibetduring the postimperial period. Both can be strikingly egalitarian, above all whencompared with the self-conscious elitism of much of Buddhist esotericism, in thattheir cults are addressed to the Tibetan people as a whole, as if to one extended fam-ily. In this respect they perhaps recall that the old Tibetan empire, though hierarchi-cal, had also staked a claim to being a universal order. The universalist dimension ofthe Padmasambhava cult is in evidence, for instance, in the introduction to a four-teenth-century treasure promulgating the benefits that accrue from the recitation ofthe guru's mantra:114I, the woman Yeshe Tshogyel, offered the vast inner and outer mandalas and thenprayed in this way: \"Great Teacher! Padmasambhava! in the past there has been noone so gracious to us, the living beings of Tibet, as you yourself have been, by exten-sively fulfilling our needs in this and future lives; nor will one so gracious come forthin the future. You have bestowed upon us your own sadhana as the very essence [ofyour teaching]. Therefore, even though I am just a woman, I harbor no doubts. Nev-ertheless, in the future, beings will have much on their minds and will become ex-tremely wild. They will look askance at the True Dharma and, in particular, theywill come to blaspheme the unsurpassed doctrine of the esoteric mantras. When thatoccurs, disease, famine, and strife will spread among all creatures, and, above all,China, Tibet, and Mongolia will become like a ravaged ants' nest, so that the subjectsof Tibet will have fallen on hard times. Though many remedies for that have beenspoken of, individuals in the future will not have occasion to practice; and even thosewho wish to practice a little will confront formidable obstacles. Beings will be argu-mentative, and their thoughts and actions will not be harmonious. Because such badtimes will be most difficult to avert, what would be the benefits, during such times, ofrelying solely on your own sadhana, the Vajraguru mantra?1151 pray that you speakof this for the sake of the base-minded ones of the future.\"Padmasambhava's response to her request powerfully affirms the universal presenceand applicability of his teaching, and its availability to devoted persons throughoutthe Tibetan world:\"Faithful girl! your prayer is most truthful. At such a time in the future, it will cer-tainly benefit beings, both temporally and ultimately. I have concealed innumerableinstructions and sadhanas as treasures in the earth, treasures in the waters, treasures in"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Imaginal Persistence of the Empire 161the rocks, and treasures in the sky. But in those bad times, it will become exceedinglydifficult for fortunate ones to find the means, the auspicious occasion [for their dis-covery]. This will be a sign that the merits of beings are exhausted. Nevertheless, eventhen the essential Vajraguru mantra will have inconceivable benefits and powers if itis recited at great places of pilgrimage, places of retreat, mountain peaks, the banks ofgreat rivers, or in craggy places and ravines inhabited by deities, ogres, and spirits, orelsewhere, by adepts adhering to the spiritual commitments of the tantras, membersof the samgha adhering to their vows, faithful men, suitable women, or others, whowith the vast inspiration of bodhisattvas, recite it one hundred, one thousand, ten thou-sand, one hundred thousand or more times. Then, all disease, famine, and strife, aswell as war, crop failure, evil omens, and magical calamities will be averted every-where; and the rains will fall and the country will prosper. In this and in future lives,and in the abyss of the intermediate state, the greatest adepts will meet me repeatedlyin person, those of moderate calibre in visions, and even the least in dreams.

As afamous passage from a fifteenth-century treasure declares:Because, generally, I harbour great compassionFor the Tibetans, who love what is new,And for creatures of this defiled age,I have filled the frontier and centre with treasures... ,116The emerging cults of Avalokitesvara and Padmasambhava from the twelfth cen-tury onwards thus both engendered a mythical reconstruction of the Tibetan worldand set forth in their sadhanas and precepts the means by which one might live in theworld thus created, a way which affirmed that the same creative, spiritual groundfrom which the empire drew its power might be actualized within every individual.We must resist, however, the temptation to place too much emphasis upon the ap-parently antihierarchical dimensions of this description. Though there is some rea-son to suppose that there may be a correlation between these cults and the relativelyegalitarian communities thriving outside of the political realm dominated by theCentral Tibetan estate system,117 we must also recall that the treasure traditions didestablish their own local hierarchies, which focused upon the figure of the treasure-discoverer himself, who was thought always to be Padmasambhava's direct repre-sentative.118 This is very much in evidence in Aris's study of Pemalingpa, of whoselegacy in Bhutan he writes:So prestigious was Pemalingpa's name that his sons, grandsons, and great-grandsonsbecame highly sought after as husbands throughout the area. . . . Thus at least ten ofthe most important houses headed by religious hierarchs ... trace their descent fromthree of Pemalingpa's sons . . . This new aristocracy more or less supplanted the ear-lier one into which it had married.119"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"162 Myth, Memory, RevelationThe phenomenon that we see at work here drew its strength in large measure fromthe persisting presence of the old empire and from the continuing felt allegiance toit, rather than to the new and strictly local hegemons who rarely commanded muchloyalty outside of their own narrow domains.

Even limiting one's field solely to Bud-dhist materials, it would be essential to consider an extensive body of Indian litera-ture—above all, the many Buddhist tantras—even before seeking to elaborate pecu-liarly Tibetan developments. And in Tibet itself, we would have to investigate themanner in which the Indian versions of these myths were variously assimilated andtransformed through the historical ramification of Tibetan Buddhism into a greatnumber of distinct lineages and schools.1My concern here, therefore, will be solely with the best-known versions of thesemyths as transmitted in the Nyingmapa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, for whichthey have a special importance. I believe that some puzzling aspects of Nyingmapathought and practice become more readily understandable when we grasp somethingof the manner in which these myths are employed within that tradition.The Nyingmapa stand in a distinctive relationship to all other religious traditionsof Tibet. As their name, which literally means the \"Ancients,\" suggests, the schoolmaintains that it uniquely represents the ancient Buddhism of Tibet, introduced dur-ing the reigns of the great kings of Tibet's imperial age, in the seventh to the ninthcenturies C.E. In contradistinction to the organized Bon religion, it identifies itself asa purely Buddhist school, whereas, over and against the other Tibetan Buddhistschools and in harmony with the Bon, it insists upon the value of an autochthonousTibetan religious tradition, expressed and exalted within a unique and continuingrevelation of the Buddha's doctrine in Tibet, often in the form of \"treasures\" (gter).Certain features of Nyingmapa Buddhism are particularly noteworthy in connectionwith the present discussion. The primordial Buddha Samantabhadra (Tib. Kun-tubzang-po, the \"Omnibeneficent\"), iconographically most often depicted as celestialblue and naked, is regarded as the supreme embodiment of Buddhahood (shared withBon). The highest expression of and vehicle for attaining that Buddha's enlighten-ment (which is equivalent to the enlightenment of all Buddhas) is the teaching of the"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"164 Myth, Memory, Revelation\"Great Perfection\" (Rdzogs-chen, shared with Bon). The paradigmatic exponent ofthis teaching, and indeed of all matters bearing on the spiritual and temporal well-being of the Tibetan people, is the immortal Guru Padmasambhava, who is the apo-theosis of the Indian tantric master remembered for playing a leading role in Tibet'sconversion to Buddhism during the eighth century, and who is always present tointercede on behalf of his devotees (distinctively Nyingmapa, though the cult ofPadmasambhava claims many adherents who are not otherwise Nyingmapa). More-over, the teachings of the latter are continually renewed in forms suitable to thedevotee's time, place, and circumstances, the agents for such renewal being \"dis-coverers of spiritual treasure\" (gter-ston/-btori), thought to be embodiments of, orregents acting on behalf of, Padmasambhava (in this form, the tradition of \"spiritualtreasure,\" gter-ma, is distinctly Nyingmapa, though non-Nyingmapa gter-ma areknown, particularly among the Bonpo).While the Nyingmapa adhere, as do other Tibetan Buddhists, to tantric forms ofritual and contemplative practice, their tantric canon is altogether distinctive, incor-porating a great quantity of literature whose \"authenticity\" is challenged, as we haveseen, by many adherents of the other Tibetan Buddhist schools, as is the authenticityof their special teaching of the Great Perfection.2 Hence, from relatively early times,their unique standpoint created for the Nyingmapas a remarkable justificatory prob-lem, which has generated an elaborate apologetical literature, much of which is his-torical in character. Moreover, the peculiar Nyingmapa emphasis on a way of prac-tice that combines elaborate tantric ritualism, including a vast body of regulationsand precepts, with the apparent antinomianism of the Great Perfection may appearto embody a remarkable contradiction. It is just this contradiction, in fact, that is bothintensified and resolved by the conjunction of the myths considered here. The myths,therefore, may be regarded as part of the justificatory apparatus of the Nyingmapaschool.In their thinking about the history of their own tradition, the Nyingmapas havecome to identify three phases in the lineage through which their special doctrineshave been transmitted: the \"lineage of the Conquerors' intention\" (rgyal-ba dgongs-brgyud); the \"symbolic lineage of the awareness holders\" (rig-'dzin brda-brgyud);and the \"aural lineage of human individuals\" (gang-zag snyan-brgyud)? The first ofthe \"three lineages\" is related to the primordial origination and disclosure, in thedomain of the Buddha's enlightenment, of the doctrine in question, in this case theGreat Perfection teaching. The third concerns the successive transmission of thatdoctrine through a line of human individuals, related each to the next as master todisciple, and always thought to be placeable, datable persons, though the specificsmay be much debated. The second lineage explains the beginnings of the transmis-sion in the human world, the stages whereby a doctrine belonging to the timeless,inexpressible realm of awakening came to be expressed in time. While the concep-tion of the three lineages in this way establishes a context in which some of what wewould regard as purely mythic material is systematically distinguished from legendand history, the distinction is made here in terms of a specific narrative content, ratherthan in terms of narrative genre taken generally.Of the myths to be considered here, that of Samantabhadra concerns only the \"lin-eage of the Conquerors' intention,\" while the myth of Rudra sets the stage for thearising of the \"symbolic lineage of awareness holders.\" The latter may thus be placed,"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Samantabhadra and Rudra 165liminally, at the boundary of myth and legend, a characterization that seems in sev-eral respects to be appropriate. Some writers, for instance, do suggest that it is inprinciple possible to calculate the date of Rudra's subjugation,4 but Samantabhadrais everywhere acknowledged to stand outside of ordinary temporal determinations.Because it is possible to trace out a long incremental development of these myths,extending far back in Indian Buddhist literature—in the case of the myth of Rudra,the eighteenth-century Tibetan author Lelung Zhepei Dorje has in fact assembledmuch of the required background5—there is no more reason to associate them par-ticularly with the authors whose versions I consider here than there is to associatethe Christian Hell-Purgatory-Heaven cosmology particularly with Dante, or Satan'sfall particularly with Milton. Nevertheless, there is also not much less reason to doso. If I risk overemphasizing here Longchenpa's association with the myth ofSamantabhadra, or Orgy en Lingpa's with that of Rudra, it is nonetheless fair tosay that these writers are particularly closely associated with the myths in questionby Tibetans themselves.Longchen Rabjampa (1308-1363) and Yarje Orgyen Lingpa (b. 1323) belong toa critical period in Tibetan history, during which, in conjunction with the weakeningand final collapse of Mongol power in China (1368), the Sakyapa hegemony (1260-1358), which had successfully protected Tibet from outright Mongol invasion, grewfeeble. As a result, Tibet was engulfed in a civil war from which the Phakmodrupahierarchs eventually emerged victorious.6 Loyalties shifted rapidly, and CentralTibet found itself adrift in uncertainty. The formative tendencies of the Nyingmapaschool, already evident in the work of earlier writers,7 now resurfaced as a powerfulpolemic, upholding the spiritual and temporal magnificence of Tibet's imperial pastagainst the decadence and factiousness of contemporary hegemonic leadership. Whileboth Longchenpa and Orgyen Lingpa must be understood in the context of the his-torical setting in which they lived and worked, and despite their common sectarianaffiliation, they appear as altogether distinctive personalities, expressing their com-mon affirmation of the Nyingmapa vision of the Buddhist enlightenment from fun-damentally different perspectives.Longchenpa, to begin, had enjoyed a thorough Buddhist scholastic education; thereare suggestions that during his youth he had something of the reputation of a bril-liant dilettante.8 Little of the large corpus of poetry and works on poetics attributedto him, and probably belonging to his earlier years, is now available, but the colo-phons of such poetical works as have come down to us make clear that he was ex-ceedingly proud of his accomplishments in refined Tibetan composition modeled onSanskrit kavya? Stylistic elegance would continue to characterize his writing, rightdown to his final testament. None of the philosophical writings (mostly commentar-ies) attributed to his early career appear to be currently available,10 though his com-mand of the major traditions of Indian Buddhist philosophy known in Tibet is evi-dent throughout his later expository writing on the Great Perfection.When he was in his midtwenties, Longchenpa became disgusted with what he hadcome to regard as the pretensions of learning in the monastic colleges of Central Tibet,and he decided to seek his enlightenment among the itinerant yogins who dwelt inthe isolated hermitages of the Tibetan wilderness. It was here that he came to en-counter Kumararaja (1266-1343), a renowned and saintly adept who specialized inthe Nyingmapa tradition of the Great Perfection. The inspiration derived from this"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"166 Myth, Memory, Revelationteaching would motivate the entire course of Longchenpa's later career, and thevolume of his literary work devoted to it is enormous. Though he apparently soughtto live as an exemplary yogin and teacher of the Great Perfection tradition, he wasnot able to avoid political entanglement completely and spent some years in exile inwhat is today Bhutan. His biography, by one of his disciples, however, provides littledetail concerning the charges brought against him and the manner of their resolu-tion, save to indicate that he had been falsely accused of being a partisan of a factionrivaling the Phakmodrupas.The corpus of Longchenpa's writings on the Great Perfection may be divided intotwo broad categories: there is his contribution, as final redactor, to the eleven-volumecollection of precepts, meditation texts, and ritual manuals known as the FourfoldInnermost Spirituality (Snying-thig ya-bzhi), this being a particular system (or rathera group of closely related systems) of Great Perfection practice; and there are hisnumerous original treatises on the theory and practice of the Great Perfection.11 Theworks making up the latter category reveal an extraordinarily rich blend of materialsand genres—all branches of Indian and Tibetan Buddhist literature are drawn intohis discussions, and he moves freely among allegory, rigorous philosophical argu-ment, history, didactic poetry, and so on, as his discourses concerning the GreatPerfection progress. So completely does the Nyingmapa tradition regard him as epito-mizing this teaching that Longchenpa is called the \"Second Samantabhadra\"—hencemy belief that his formulation of the myth of Samantabhadra may be justly thoughtto be paradigmatic.Of Orgyen Lingpa almost nothing reliable is known; the available hagiographies—which make him out to have been, like Longchenpa, the object of some persecutionat the hands of the Phakmodrupas—are all quite late.12 However, the major worksattributed to him are the products of an unusual tour de force and so do permit us toadduce a few generalities regarding their author.All of Orgyen Lingpa's known writings belong to the class of texts known as \"trea-sures,\" said to have been set down and then concealed by Padmasambhava and hisimmediate disciples during the eighth or ninth century. Orgyen Lingpa is presented asbeing merely their rediscoverer. Though \"treasures\" of various kinds are attributed tohim, those for which he is best known are six \"historical\" works relating the legends ofPadmasambhava and of Tibet under the reign of Padmasambhava's royal patron, KingTrhi Songdetsen (reigned until 797). These six texts are always thought to form a pair:the Testimonial Record of Padmasambhava (Padma bka'-thang) and the FivefoldCollection of Testimonial Records (Bka'-thang sde-lnga). The first is a verse epic, in108 cantos, telling of the coming of Padmasambhava and his conversion of Tibet toBuddhism during Trhi Songdetsen's reign.13 The five texts forming the second mem-ber of the pair develop aspects of the same story from separate perspectives as docu-ments concerning (1) the indigenous Tibetan gods and demons, (2) the Tibetan kings,(3) the queens, (4) the ministers, and (5) the scholars.14 Taken together, these workselaborate a powerful vision of Tibet and its historically unique station in the Buddhistuniverse. Their \"prophetic\" passages explicitly comment on the political situation inmid-fourteenth-century Tibet, so that the hagiographers' assertions that Orgyen Lingpabecame the object of political persecution seem not at all implausible.15The extraordinary body of tradition that finds its way into Orgyen Lingpa's Tes-timonial Records makes it clear that their author was greatly learned in a certain sense,"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Samantabhadra and Rudra 167but also that he was not the product of the same refined scholastic upbringing thatwe know Longchenpa to have enjoyed. His writing is vigorous, but coarse; stylisticfine points were of no interest to him, and this lends his work a peculiar raw power.If Longchenpa's harmonious marriage of poetic elegance and ethereal spiritualitysuggests at times a Tibetan smiled on by Dante's Beatrice, then Orgyen Lingpa'spen would appear to have been blessed by Chaucer's Wife of Bath.What I wish to stress here, however, are some assumptions that seem common tothem both, which may be summarized briefly: our world is such that the full enlight-enment of a Buddha is both a desirable and realizable end for human beings; Tibethas historically become the guardian of the Buddha's doctrine, in which the meansto realize that enlightenment are disclosed; and it is the ancient Nyingmapa traditionalone that possesses the quintessential revelation of that doctrine. The myths underconsideration here are both concerned to underwrite the first and last of these pointsin particular.Before I close this section, it occurs to me that some may wish to know some-thing about the tradition of teaching I've been referring to throughout this book asthe Great Perfection (Rdzogs-pa chen-po). This is a very difficult question, to whichI shall return in the following chapter.16 Suffice it for the moment to provide someremarks on this topic by Longchen Rabjampa himself, though I recognize that, with-out further commentary, the terse discussion found here is bound to remain some-what obscure:The unsurpassed vehicle is the supremely esoteric Great Perfection, which brings aboutreal union with the spontaneously present expanse [of reality, dharmadhatu}. In theunchanging expanse of the ground, similar to space, the qualities of enlightenmentare spontaneously present, like the sun, moon, planets, and stars. Because they arespontaneously present from the very beginning, without having been sought out, thepath is one of natural direct perception, without tiresome exertion. Its intention isequivalent to that of the Dharmakaya, self-abiding as the unconditioned mandala ofthe expanse of inner radiance, and it is the supreme view of the abiding nature ofreality that brings about [its] realization. Ephemeral obscurations are clouds in the ex-panse of purity: in the minds of beings, bewildering appearances become manifestwithout veridical existence. ... It is by knowing the nature of bewilderment as theappearance of what is not that one is freed....Whatever consciousness arises is the self-liberated play of the body of reality, likewater and waves, a single undulation in the body of reality. This is the intention ofultimate truth, the uppermost pinnacle among views; this is the Great Perfection.17The Myth of SamantabhadraBuddhist doctrine has generally affirmed the world to be entirely lawlike; there is afinal and ultimate principle (or body of principles), even though, at a certain point inthe rarified atmosphere of Buddhist discourse, this may become impossible to graspin thought or in words. The attempt to analyze the principles underlying apparentreality, and to pursue the course of analysis until no further analysis is possible, hasgiven much of classical Buddhist thought a markedly \"metaphysical\" character, sothat here, perhaps more than in many other instances where a stream of thought not"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"168 Myth, Memory, Revelationflowing from the Greek spring is termed \"philosophical,\" we may retain this con-vention unapologetically.A key problem for Buddhist philosophical thou'ght, throughout its long history,has been this: how can we resolve the triple tension arising from the fundamentalassumptions that: (1) the world is lawlike through and through; (2) the world is suchthat there are ignorant beings who are subject to a continual round of trouble due totheir ignorance; and (3) the world is such that these beings may possibly overcometheir ignorance and the pain that it brings, thus attaining nirvana? Tension arises here,because it may be thought that (1) determines (2), and so precludes (3); or that (1)determines (3), and so neutralizes (2); or that (2) and (3) jointly entail that (1) beweakened, that is, that the world is almost nomic, but not quite. This is perhaps theBuddhist analogue to the West's headache concerning free will and determinism. Themyth of Samantabhadra represents the formulation in Nyingmapa Buddhism of apeculiar way of expressing the mystery of these three fundamental assumptions andtheir interrelationships.Corresponding to the three assumptions, what I am terming the \"myth of Saman-tabhadra\" (the closest equivalent Nyingmapa phrase is (ii) just below), actually con-sists of three topics:18 (i) how the ground became manifest in spontaneous presence(Ihun-grub gzhi-snang-gi shar-tshul); (ii) how Samantabhadra was liberated (kun-tubzang-po 'i grol-tshul); and (iii) how ignorant sentient beings became bewildered (ma-rig sems-can-gyi 'khrul-tshul). In form, then, what we have here is a creation myth19that explains certain broad features of our world, how it came into being as the pecu-liar sort of world that it is, and why things are such that it could be no other way. Butit is a myth elaborated with a specific philosophical purpose, namely, through topics(i), (ii), and (iii) to make three fundamental but not clearly compatible assumptionsof Buddhist thought somehow co-intelligible.Longchen Rabjampa repeats the myth of Samantabhadra, with or without detailedexposition, at many points scattered throughout his writings. I shall discuss here onlythe versions found in his massive summation of the peculiar doctrines of the GreatPerfection tradition, the Jewel Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle (Theg-mchog rin-po-che'i mdzod). Here the myth of Samantabhadra is summarized briefly at the verybeginning of the text, to introduce the manner in which the Great Perfection teach-ing originated in the world. It is in this context that Nyingmapas sometimes speak ofthe myth as representing the \"lineage of the Conqueror's intention.\" Later in the sametreatise, the myth is made the subject of a very detailed discussion constituting thewhole of the ninth chapter, upon which the discussion that follows here will partiallybe based. The initial short version is as follows:Prior to everything, samsara and nirvana being not divided, nor dividing, nor to bedivided, Samantabhadra, the teacher whose dominion is perfect, arose from the pri-mordial ground—the expanse that is self-emergent pristine gnosis, the nucleus of theSugata—as the manifestation of the ground. In the instant that he emerged from theground, because he recognized this to be self-manifest, then owing to the three self-emergent principles he seized his imperial realm in the spontaneously present preciousenclosure, the great primordial purity that is the original site of exhaustion, the fieldof the vase-body of youth. The enlightened attributes of renunciation and realizationbeing perfected, he achieved buddhahood in the manner of the dharmakaya, and abidesthus inwardly clarified. . . . Subsequently, from the expressive play that arises from"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Samantabha dra and Rudra 169the original ground as the manifestation of the ground, mundane creatures appearedas if bewildered without cause for bewilderment, as in a dream. Seeing them thus dis-turbed, his compassionate excellence was aroused... .20The original ground (gdod-ma'i gzhi) stands wholly removed from the three tem-poral determinations of past, present, and future. For this reason, it is sometimesspoken of in Nyingmapa thought as being atemporal (dus-med), or as being an \"in-determinate time\" (ma-nges-pa'i dus), or a \"fourth time\" (dus bzhi-pa). The groundis pure potency, possible manifest as anything whatsoever (chos ci-yang 'char-ba,ci-yang snang-bd). Its faculty for the actualization of its potencies is termed \"ex-pressive power\" (rtsal), and this is intrinsically noetic. The ground in its indetermi-nacy is essentially empty (ngo-bo stong); in its unlimited potency is characteristi-cally open, or limpid (rang-bzhin gsal); and in its expressive power is unimpededspirituality (lit. \"compassion,\" thugs-rje ma-'gags-pa). In virtue of these three prin-ciples, it is the ground of primordial buddhahood, embodying the attributes of thethree \"bodies\" (sku-gsum) of reality (chos-sku), rapture (longs-sku), and emanation(sprul-sku). The expressive power of the ground, being intrinsically noetic, is possi-bly aware that it is itself the expressive power of the ground—it may \"recognize\"itself (rang-ngo-shes). Because the self-recognition of a timeless ground must be-long to the ground in its timelessness, its self-recognition is uniquely characterizedas the attainment of buddhahood by the primordial Buddha Samantabhadra. Whereassuch self-recognition is a possibility of the noetic aspect of expressive power, thatpower has also primordially actualized non-self-recognizing cognition, which, alien-ated from the ground from which it is no other, by virtue of its non-self-recognition,has become \"bewildered\" ('khrul-pa) and so has fallen into multiplicity, projectingitself forward temporally. In this aspect, the expressive power of the ground is \"lim-itless sentient beings.\" In the Bkra-shis mdzes-ldan chen-po 'i rgyud (The GreatAuspicious and Beauteous Tantra), cited by Longchenpa, the primordial Buddha ismade to speak as follows:Though I am free from bewilderment, bewilderment has emerged from my expres-sive power. Though I do not come into being as ground, my nature having arisen with-out impediment, unawareness has spontaneously emerged from my spirituality that iswithout determination. Just as clouds do not intrinsically exist in the sky, but emergefortuitously, so there is no unawareness at all that belongs to the ground... .21The passage from the indeterminacy and atemporality of the ground to the temporalprojection of numberless sentient beings, without implying that the primordial Bud-dha must himself fall from his primordial enlightenment, is one that perhaps cannotbe made without some element of apparent paradox. My concern is not, however, toelaborate here a suitably purified Nyingmapa cosmogony, but rather to illustrate themanner in which the fundamental Nyingmapa cosmogonic myth is itself constructedas an expression of Nyingmapa speculative thought. What is crucial for the Nyingmapais that this account establish an essential relationship between the primordial Buddhaand sentient beings, such that it be possible for us to recover the ground of our beingand thus to participate in Samantabhadra's beginningless enlightenment.The path of practice by means of which our recovery of Samantabhadra's enlight-enment is to take place is, of course, the path of the Great Perfection, whose skillfulmeans are intended precisely to introduce sentient beings directly to their affinity"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"170 Myth, Memory, RevelationFigure 9.1 Samantabhadrain the form of the body ofrapture (Sambhogakaya).A modern statue atMindroling.

When such an introduction takes place, the goal of the pathmay be realized almost immediately. As the Tibetan poet-saint Milarepa (1040-1123)was told by his Nyingmapa teacher Rongton Lhaga:\"This teaching of the Great Perfection leads one to triumph at the root, to triumph atthe summit, and to triumph in the fruits of achievement. To meditate on it by day is tobe Buddha in one day. To meditate on it by night is to be Buddha in one night.\"22But what is one to do who is so bewildered by obscuration that he simply cannot per-ceive that to which he is to be introduced by the teaching of the Great Perfection? Thatwas Milarepa's problem; perhaps it is also my problem; and it is possibly your prob-lem, too. The myth of Rudra offers the Nyingmapa response to this dilemma.The Matricide RudraIn the Rudra episode of the Testimonial Record of Padmasambhava, the raw energyof Orgyen Lingpa's verse reaches one of its several pinnacles.

In its earliestversions, in Indian Buddhist tantric literature, the myth concerns the defeat of £ivaby the Buddha, and the manner in which their battle necessitated and prepared theground for the appearance in the world of the tantras taught by the Buddha.23 Per-haps an antecedant can even be detected in the Buddha's confrontation with Mara.24In one of the peculiarly Nyingmapa tantras, the Mdo dgongs-pa 'dus-pa (The SutraGathering All Intentions), the myth is enormously expanded and becomes the orga-nizing metaphor for the text as a whole.25 It is this tradition that Orgyen Lingpa in-corporates into his own work, where the fifth canto tells of Rudra's appearance inthe world, and the sixth of his final subjugation.26 The translated text of the openingof the fifth relates Rudra's past life as the wayward monk Tharpa Nakpo (\"BlackLiberation\"):After the teaching of Samantabhadra,In the land called Dujongtsham,There was the householder Koukala,Who had a son named KoukuntriAnd a servant, Pramadeva.The two were seen to be fit to be trained by the two teachings.27To prevent the decline of the emanational body's teaching,[The master] took birth as the monk Thupka Zhonu.To prevent the decline of the secret mantras, the teaching of the body ofrapture,He took birth as a great householder, a \"family-maintainer.\"All men were exceptionally devoted to that monk,Known as one with one body but two names.28Taking up the great path of five yogas,29 he practiced,And saw the skandhas' abode to be empty.At that time Koukiintri grew faithful,And his doubts were resolved, whoever he asked:\"What manner of teacher is Thupka Zhonu?Does he teach the doctrine that without attaining enlightenment,Without abandoning affliction, you may practice just as you please?\"\"The monk teaches just that,\" they said,\"To remove ignorance and realize nirvana,Thupka Zhonu is the best.\"Koukuintri and PramadevaWent to Thupka Zhonu's abode.\"May you, skillful in means, accept usTo receive the mantras' intention, to behold the exalted truthIn yoga by practicing as one pleases,Retaining doubts and the three afflictions.\"Praying thus, they bowed their heads to his feet.The teacher said, \"So it is!

His con-quests engulf the subterranean and terrestrial realms, until he seeks to bring even thedomain of the gods under his sway, challenging all to do battle with him. The nameby which he is feared is \"Matricide Rudra.\" The Buddhas and bodhisattvas of alltimes and places, responding to the terrified supplications of the gods, assemble todetermine the means whereby this demonic force that threatens to engulf all samsaramight be at last defeated. Prominent among the Buddhas is Vajrasattva, the Adaman-tine Being, who, it so happens, is none other than Thupka Zhonu, the banished mas-ter of Rudra's past life as the apostate Tharpa Nakpo, while his former servantDenphak is now Vajrapani, the Holder of the Adamantine Sceptre. They are ordainedby those assembled to assume the forms of Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of com-passion, and his consort, the saviouress Tara, who are then consecrated as the fero-cious couple HayagrTva, \"Horse Neck,\" and Vajravarahl, \"Adamantine Sow,\" to dobattle with Rudra. HayagrTva, making himself minute, enters Rudra's \"lower gate,\"the anus, and then explodes to tremendous proportion within his body. The demon,vanquished, vows to serve the Buddha's teaching as a powerful protector, and theelements of his broken body are transubstantiated to become the sacraments of tantricBuddhism. For this reason, Hayagrlva, as Avalokitesvara's wrathful counterpart, isdepicted as demonic in outer form, with a small horse's head emerging from the crownof the demon's skull; he is thus always garbed in the body of Rudra.In Orgy en Lingpa's telling of it, the myth of Rudra is exceptionally complex, andthe would-be interpreter of it must be wary of the seductions of possible reductionistreadings. Robert Paul, among the most perceptive interpreters of this myth to date,has focused primarily on those themes that can be clearly related to his overridingconcern with exploring the structural problems posed by the continuity of genera-"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Samantabhadra and Rudra 175Figure 9.2 The wrathfulHayagriva, a small horse'slead protruding within hisFlaming hair.

Fraternal rivalry (= the rivalry of codisciples),antagonism between father and son (= master and disciple), matricide, and homo-sexual anal rape are among the key motifs in Paul's reading, which is markedly in-fluenced by the psychoanalytic work of Ge/a Roheim.32 It is not my concern here toattempt to assess Paul's interpretations in general, and, indeed, I think that Paul hassuggested and begun to develop a powerful hermeneutic. At the same time, how-ever, he has necessarily bracketed those elements of the tale that have no apparentbearing on the proposed interpretation. What I should like to do, then, is to turn tosome of the other aspects of Orgyen Lingpa's version of the myth, without attempt-ing an overarching interpretation. In accord with my primary focus on the characterof Tibetan Buddhist thought, I wish to concentrate on the apparently \"philosophi-cal\" aspects of the first section of the Rudra tale just translated. Paul dismisses thisentire passage in a single and, to my mind, misleading sentence:Whereas Evil Pig [= Denphak in my translation here. Paul is following Toussaint'sproblematic reading of the name as Ngan-phag.] understood and accepted the master'steaching, Universal Misery, or Black Deliverance [= Tharpa Nakpo], failed to see the"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"176 Myth, Memory, Revelationvalue of a doctrine which preaches the vanity of this world and nonattachment to allthings.33Clearly, Orgyen Lingpa's narration of the episode attaches more weight than this tothe \"bad disciple's\" failure of understanding: if Tharpa Nakpo's response to the teach-ing is to be summed up as a shrugged \"I don't get it,\" then it becomes very difficult tosee how this long segment of the story should be related to the brutal events that follow.Let us return then to the beginning of the tale, to the assertion that the events to berecounted take place after the teaching of Samantabhadra. We have seen already howthe Samantabhadra myth attempts to bridge the gulf between time and eternity, be-tween primordial enlightenment and the bewilderment of sentient beings. The Rudraepisode, by opening with reference to this, begins by indexing itself in relation to thetemporal projection of mundane being that unfolds when the expressive power ofthe ground has passed into bewilderment. All of the events that follow are thus cir-cumscribed by bewilderment.As sentient beings, we have all already failed to see what Thupka Zhonu soughtto reveal to his two disciples. Because we have all thus failed in primordial time, itwould be odd to regard that to be the particular point Orgyen Lingpa is seeking todrive home here; for it has already been driven home by placing the entire episodeoutside the domain of Samantabhadra's teaching. What I think we should attend to,rather, is the relationship delineated among simple failure to understand, egocentricrebellion of the will, and radical evil. Samsara is not merely bewildering (after all,couldn't one be eternally subject to pleasant bewilderment?), but it's downright vi-cious, and to see why this is so, we must trace the temporal projection of samsaricbeing from the primordial origination of bewilderment to the point at which thatbewilderment generates pride—it is not just error, but rather arrogant error, that con-demns us to the round of meaningless pain. The myth of Rudra is Buddhism's clos-est approach to a myth of original sin.34The myth of Rudra \"explains\" the origins of tantricism, in part because Rudrahoodcharacterizes our nature as embodied persons who are constitutionally disposed tolust and self-protection, to arrogance and rage. Tantricism, or something like it, issoteriologically necessitated by our being what we are, by our world's being as it is.So it is that the Nyingmapa practitioner, on days when penitential rites are required,recites a confessional litany entitled Rudra's Lamentation?5Must the Message Be Mythic?If the \"philosophical\" readings of the myths of Samantabhadra and Rudra that I'vebegun to sketch out here (and, admittedly, much remains to be filled in) reflect inpart the manner in which these myths are understood within the Nyingmapa tradi-tion, then they will contribute to the formation of a contextualizing myth aboutNyingmapa Buddhism, in relation to which other features of Nyingmapa practiceand thought will be more intelligible to us than they might have been otherwise. Ibelieve that this is in fact the case, that the peculiar Nyingmapa synthesis of the GreatPerfection teaching of the intrinsic enlightenment of all beings—a teaching that, likecertain aspects of Chan, seems irreducibly subitist and antinomian—with the gradu-"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Samantabhadra and Rudra 177alist esotericism of the tantras, may be now seen as something more than jumbledeclecticism. For the combined argument of the two myths generates a view of thehuman condition according to which our inherent identity with the OmnibeneficentBuddha is concealed not only by the veil of unknowing, but further by a profoundand eminently evil act of rebellion—some may recognize here an intensified refor-mulation of the classical Buddhist doctrine of the \"two obscurations.\"36 It is there-fore only the violent inversion of the soul, catalyzed by the powerful means taughtin the tantras, that can create within us the essential clearing in which the truth of theGreat Perfection may be disclosed.The myth of Samantabhadra as told by Longchen Rabjampa, and that of Rudra astold by Orgyen Lingpa, are thus seen to be constructed so as to convey, among otherthings, a number of apparently philosophical messages concerning eternity andtemporality, enlightenment and bewilderment, understanding and the rebellion of thewill in ignorance. It is clear that both of these authors have deliberately incorporatedthese messages into their mythmaking; these are not cases in which apparent philo-sophical messages are discovered in \"primitive\" myths thanks only to the learnedinterpretations of contemporary readers. It is equally clear that the messages in ques-tion can in some respects be separated from the myths in which they are found—notonly our analysis, but the commentarial tradition of Nyingmapa Buddhism confirmsthat in practice.37 Why, then, continue to tell the myths at all? Because they are moreentertaining than cold, dry philosophy? Because they give the messages in questionextra oomph? Or is there some essential element that is unavoidably left out when-ever the philosophical message is removed from the tale in which it is told?Human thought, to repeat what an ancient and hallowed tradition tells us, is for-ever oscillating between two poles, and finding a lasting home for itself in neither: atone extreme it follows Plato into his heavens and takes up its dwelling among eter-nal and unchanging objects; at the other it steps into the stream with Heraclitus, to beinundated by the surging flood of change. The abiding truths of the human condi-tion, however, disclose themselves to us, if ever they do, precisely in the midst of thestream. For this reason we cannot'desist from being tellers of tales: our fall and re-demption are played out only in time. The philosopher who knows well to bathe inthe Heraclitean stream, to warm his head beneath Plato's sun, will be content thatboth are present in the landscape of thought and recognize in narrative a path be-tween them. Sometimes he will find philosophy progressing along it, seeking out afertile spot, trying to find the perfect balance of moisture and warmth.So long as philosophy remains anchored in our common experience, it will haveneed of plentiful tales, and some of these tales will be myths. For these, indeed, areits anchor. Must the message be mythic? From the vantage point we've reached here,it becomes difficult to see how it could be otherwise."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"10The Amnesic Monarch and theFive Mnemic Men\"Memory\" in the Great PerfectionTraditionPreliminary OrientationsIn the literature of the Great Perfection (rdzogs-chen) traditions of the Nyingmapaschool of Tibetan Buddhism, the words dran-pa, \"memory\" (= Skt. smrti, smarand),and dran-med, \"freedom from or loss of memory, unconsciousness, inattentiveness\"(= Skt. vismrti, asmrti), are very frequently encountered, among other terms formedon the lexeme dran-, \"to remember.\"1 Though no systematic exegesis of the use ofthese terms within the tradition itself has yet come to my attention, it appears none-theless possible to attempt a tentative account of the role of certain basic terms relat-ing to memory in a few distinctive contexts.2Something must be said at the outset of the way in which \"distinctive context\" isto be understood here. The literature of the Great Perfection developed in some re-spects in a fluid relationship with other branches of Tibetan religion and culture:3 onthe one hand, for instance, we find the colloquializing tendencies of Tibetan biographi-cal and popular literature informing the diction of those writing on the Great Perfec-tion; while on the other, normative uses of Indian Buddhist scholastic materials arealso well represented. Thus such monumental products of doctrinal speculation andsystematization as the Yid-bzhin mdzod (The Wish-Fulfilling Treasury) or the Shing-rta chen-mo (Great Chariot) of Longchen Rabjampa (1308-1363) involve the delib-erate effort to disclose the Great Perfection as fully harmonized with, in fact theculmination of, the Indian Buddhist inheritance of theory and practice.4 To surveythe occurrences of dran- derivatives in such works would require the repetition of agreat amount of material gleaned from Indian Abhidharma and Yogacara sources,which are not among our present concerns.5Nonetheless, the superabundance of texts of the Great Perfection traditions thathave become available during the past two decades do reveal a unique system, asubstantial portion of whose technical terminology is not shared by other Buddhistschools, for example, rtsal, \"expressive power,\" ka-dag, \"primordial purity,\" cog-bzhag, \"total presence,\" and so forth. And many terms that are common elsewhereare also found in Great Perfection writings, used in special senses or with peculiar"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The Amnesic Monarch and the Five Mnemic Men 179connotations, for instance, rig-pa, \"awareness,\" rol-pa, \"(dis)play,\" or thugs-rje,\"compassion/spirituality.\"6 The question we should ask about dran- derivatives thenis: in those texts that are not especially concerned to harmonize the Great Perfectionwith scholastic norms, but instead to present it as a distinctive way of thought andpractice, do we find evidence to suggest that these terms were regularly used in apeculiar manner, which possibly extends beyond the parameters of normal Tibetancolloquial and Buddhist technical usage?It is clear that this question must be answered affirmatively, though the volume ofextant Great Perfection texts precludes a thorough survey of the relevant material atthe present time. My discussion will therefore concern selected themes in just one well-defined group of texts whose authority within the tradition provides some assurancethat the conclusions reached will characterize the perspective of the Great Perfectiontraditions more broadly than such a narrow sampling might otherwise suggest.The texts chosen for consideration here are all drawn from the rediscovered\"treasures\" (gter-ma) of Rikdzin Godem (1337-1408), founder of the importantNyingmapa suborder of the Northern Treasure (byang-gter), so called because theoriginal site of these treasures' revelation was Zangzang Lhadrag, a sacred moun-tain in the wilds of Tibet's Northern Plain (byang-thang).7 Among the many trea-sures forming the corpus of Rikdzin Godem's rediscoveries, the Great Perfection isexpansively treated in the two closely related cycles of the Kun-tu bzang-po 'i dgongs-pa zang-thal (The Penetration of the Intention of Samantabhadra) and the Ka-dagrang-byung rang-shar (Primordial Purity, Self-Emergent and Self-Arisen), which infact are often transmitted as a single corpus.8 They are marked by an unusual clarityand precision of diction, in which it may be possible to detect some affinity with theGreat Perfection writings of Longchen Rabjampa. And—what makes them mostsuitable for present purposes—dran- derivatives seem to receive a remarkable de-gree of emphasis throughout.In the discussion that follows, I shall set forth a preliminary analysis of the use ofwords generated from the lexeme dran- as they occur in a single text of the PrimordialPurity, Self-Emergent and Self-Arisen collection, the Sangs-rgyas rdo-rje sems-dpa'idgongs-pa: kun-grol yangs-pa'i rgyud (The Intention of Buddha Vajrasattva, theWide-Open Tantra of Universal Liberation).9 So as to bracket out irrelevant conno-tations that stem from the use of the English words \"memory,\" \"recollection,\" \"for-getting,\" and so on, I shall use derivatives of the Greek root mna, \"to remember, bemindful\" (= Skt. smf) for all Tibetan terms formed on dran-. Thus, for dran-pa, Ishall use the phrase \"mnemic engagement\"; for dran-med, \"amnesis\"; for dran-rig,\"mnemic awareness\" (i.e., acts of awareness involving mnemic engagement); andfor dran-pa'i mi, \"mnemic man\" (the sense of this allegorical phrase will becomeclear later). Where dran- is best treated as a verb, it will unfortunately be necessaryto employ some wordy constructions, for instance, \"to practice mnemic engagement,\"but this still seems preferable to the introduction of English verbs whose connota-tions might sometimes be even more misleading. For \"memory\" and \"remembering\"seem to be for us terms preeminently referring to the representation of the past, sothat our preunderstanding as determined by them may sometimes obscure the sig-nificance of dran- in the present discussion.10While the preliminary analysis of the concept of mnemic engagement in GreatPerfection thought will have a markedly phenomenological coloring to it, it would"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"180 Myth, Memory, Revelationbe an error to suggest, as some recent writers have perhaps done, that the tradition ofthought and practice here considered is to be distinguished as a sort of phenomenol-ogy par excellence. This is plainly incorrect. Indeed, it will be precisely to avoid thismisapprehension that we shall turn, in later sections of this chapter, to study the doc-trines considered here as they are employed within the cycle of the Penetration ofthe Intention of Samantabhadra in allegory and in the practice of prayer. The issueof paramount concern for the Great Perfection thinker is salvific praxis, praxis thatmust open up a passageway mediating between \"ordinary\" experience and the richdomain of symbolic forms, the mundus imaginalis,11 and between the latter and thatprimordial reality that stands in the final analysis beyond temporality and symbolicmediation. Our discussion, accordingly, will seek broadly to introduce the theme ofmnemic engagement as it pertains to each of these three worlds, proceeding from itsfunction in \"introducing\" the timeless realm of the dharmakaya, to its symbolic rep-resentation in allegory, to its role in the transfiguration of the ordinary through theritual practice of prayer.12Mnemic Engagement in the Wide-Open Tantraof Universal LiberationThe Wide-Open Tantra of Universal Liberation does not use all of the terms just listed.So as to comprehend more clearly the contextual background for the occurrences ofdran- we do find there, it will be useful to have some conception of the text overall,as this will supply a brief Baedeker to the particular system of the Great Perfectioninvolved here. A short work of nine chapters, its first treats the nature of the primor-dial ground, and the manner in which the original Buddha Samantabhadra and be-wildered sentient beings have both arisen from it.13 The second chapter concerns thecharacteristics of bewilderment, which obstructs the potential to encounter and real-ize the teachings whereby the freedom of buddhahood may be achieved. This is fol-lowed by \"The Introduction to Awareness as the Dharmakaya.\" \"Introduction\" (ngo-sprodY-sprad), as used in this third chapter in its technical sense, refers to instructionthat, if skillfully delivered to an appropriately receptive disciple by an appropriatelyqualified master, catalyzes an immediate intuitive grasp of the instruction's content.This need not be so mysterious as it may seem: when a tennis pro points out what'swrong with your serve with the result that there is a flash of recognition, you ex-claim, \"Got it!\" and then deliver one that screams past Martina, you've just becomethe fortunate recipient of an \"introduction.\" But here we're concerned not with thecontact of racket and ball, but with the primordial relationship between the essentialnature of mind and the ground of its origination. It is this third chapter that first usesdran-, though elsewhere Godem does use it in connection with subject matter simi-lar to that of the earlier chapters of the text, for example, in the Prayer of Great Power(translated in the book's appendix).The fourth and fifth chapters survey, respectively, false assumptions about thenature of apparent reality and the manner in which these generate continued bewil-derment, and the essential elements of practical instruction on meditation that ac-cord with the teachings given in the preceding chapters. For the purposes of the presentdiscussion, it is the sixth chapter that is perhaps the most important: \"On Circum-"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The Amnesic Monarch and the Five Mnemic Men 181stantial Proximity to the Dharmakaya.\" This describes the recovery of the realiza-tion of the dharmakaya under the varied circumstances to which ordinary experiencesubjects us, such as birth and death, waking consciousness, sleep and dream.The two following chapters conclude the actual teaching of the Wide-Open Tantraof Universal Liberation by providing practical details regarding the appropriate timesat which the various meditational practices of the Great Perfection are to be under-taken, and the means whereby buddhahood may be realized during the intermediatestate following death. Because this is a \"rediscovered treasure\" (gter-ma), the ninthand final chapter presents a discourse on the concealment of the text, with prophe-cies of its recovery.14In its small span of ten folios, then, the Wide-Open Tantra of Universal Libera-tion provides a remarkably thorough account of the central features of Great Perfec-tion cosmology, phenomenology, and soteriology, describing the most essential ele-ments of both theory and practice. The fact that a given term does not occur in aparticular context, of course, should not be taken as evidence that the term does notelsewhere so occur. But the very brevity of the text permits, at least, the isolation ofa relatively small range of characteristic occurrences of the technical terms foundtherein. The instances of dran- occurring in the Wide-Open Tantra of Universal Lib-eration are given here in full, beneath the headings of the chapters in which they arefound and in the order of their occurrence:Chapter 3: The Introduction to Awareness As the Dharmakaya(137.5) \"One ought to attend to the example and its significance, with unwaveringmnemic engagement.\"15 This occurs in the beginning of the chapter and is offered asan injunction preceding the \"introduction\" itself. \"Mnemic engagement\" in this in-stance means, roughly, \"mindful attentiveness,\" that is, to the content of the teach-ings about to be conferred.(138.3) \"Concerning this mind that is bewildered at present, from the time of one'sbirth until now, mnemic engagement [reflecting] whatever one's done [has been and]is [karmic] residue.\"16 The topic under discussion is the bewilderment arising fromthe universal ground in its conditional aspect (sbyor-ba rkyen-gyi kun-gzhi). Here,\"mnemic engagement\" is a determination of the \"bewildered mind,\" referring to mycontinuously renewed construction of my past, and to the particular acts of conscious-ness that inform that construction. It is not uncommon, in similar contexts, to see itclosely related to bag-chags (Skt. vasana), residual dispositions generated by previ-ous action, karman.(138.6-139.1) \"Just that is the self-presenting awareness that is the dharmakaya. Bycontinuous mnemic engagement in it, one thoroughly investigates and establishesit.\"17 This passage concludes the \"introduction\" given in chapter three. Reference to\"mnemic engagement\" here involves a double entendre: on the one hand, the \"it\"(de) that in the second sentence indicates the object of the act in question may referto the prepositional content of the teaching just given (namely, that \"thus-and-suchis the self-presenting awareness that is the dharmakaya.\"). In this case, \"mnemic en-gagement\" must mean, roughly, \"mindful attentiveness\" that is directed upon thatteaching. On the other hand, the object must also be understood to be the \"self-presenting awareness that is the dharmakaya,\" so that \"mnemic engagement\" must"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"182 Myth, Memory, Revelationalso refer to the reflexive disclosure of that awareness to the meditator who has graspedthe point of the teaching, who has genuinely realized the \"introduction.\" \"Investiga-tion\" in this case cannot be the discursive analysis of ideas or their contents. Rather,it is the self-disclosure of the meditator's awareness qua dharmakaya. The doubleentendre here is, I think, deliberate, precisely marking the passage from a prelimi-nary intentional relationship between the disciple's thought and the content of the\"introduction\" she has been granted, to the disciple's nonintentional, reflexive re-covery of the self-presenting awareness that is the dharmakaya. This act of recoveryis in a sense the objective of a secondary intention, for it is the intention of the teach-ing whose content is the intention of initial reflection. In the terminology of norma-tive scholastic Buddhism, this passage would be analogous to the movement from\"discernment born of thought\" (cintamayi prajnd) to \"discernment born of medita-tive cultivation\" (bhavandmayi prajnd).18Chapter 5: The Teaching of the Conduct of the Path(141.2-3) \"At that time, when one is in meditative equipoise, then, neither passinginto amnesis, which follows after [the discursive thoughts, imaginings, and so forth,that] proceed one after the next, nor passing, withdrawn, into sleep and oblivion,awareness is essentially self-clarifying.\"19 \"Amnesis\" is here the engagement in dis-cursive thought that militates against those forms of \"mnemic engagement\" thatfavor or are constitutive of the realization of the goals of the path. A few lines laterthe latter conception is further elaborated:(141.3-4) \"The wide-open universal ground is dharmakaya-as-mother, and uncon-trived awareness is dharmakaya-as-son. If the son's mnemic engagement is not lost,then, meeting with the mother, bliss is won.\"20 And later in the same chapter weare told:(142.6) \"When the five poisons [stupidity, passion, hate, envy, and pride] adventi-tiously arise, the least [of disciples] looks to the essence of beginning-and-end [thatis, determines the emptiness of the 'poisons' in terms of their coming-into-being,abiding, and perishing], the middling [disciple] looks to the appearance of objects asapparition, and the best, through mnemic engagement, looks to self-presenting aware-ness.\"21 The continued use of the verb \"to look/gaze/perceive\" (ha) throughout thispassage, which accords with the Tibetan stylistic love of verbal parallelism, shouldnot obscure the nonintentional character of the practice attributed to the best disciplehere, as contrasted with the two preceding (though it must also be noted that the GreatPerfection traditions make abundant use of ocular imagery). To clarify somewhatthe notion of nonintentional presentation, consider those instances in which we havea \"sense-memory\" or the memory of a mood, not in the propositional sense of re-membering that we were once in the mood in question, but in the sense of being in acertain mood and re-cogni/ing it, as part of that experienced state of being. \"Memory,\"in such cases, is the palpable recovery of a state of being or affect, and thus in a pe-culiar sense is no more intentional in its phenomenological character than were theapparently recovered experiences when they originally occurred. It is a secondaryact of awareness that determines that the act in question is a memory of a prior expe-rience, and this secondary act is, of course, an intentional one. It is, however, an actof awareness that one is experiencing a type of memory and not the memory itself."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Amnesic Monarch and the Five Mnemic Men 183Chapter 6: On Circumstantial Proximity to the DharmakayaThis chapter makes plentiful use of dran-, and, most significantly, closes by makingexplicit a distinction of usage that has been presupposed throughout the precedingdiscussion. Rather than enumerate each occurrence in this chapter separately, it willbe clearer to present them in two groups, abridging the text somewhat in the firstinstance.(144.3-6) \"This arising of awareness as anything whatever, by dissolving into thedharmakaya itself, [results in] sleep's being a self-emergent immobility. When dream-appearances arise, suffering fades away immediately following mnemic engage-ment. .. .Thus, the many bewildering appearances of dream are just mind'sown light:manifesting shimmeringly, they dissolve into [that] itself. By mnemic engagementalone, [the dualistic modes of] apprehended object and apprehender are released.Therefore, swiftness of mnemic engagement is supreme.\"22 The modes of mnemicengagement involved in the meditational discipline of the dream-state appear to beessentially similar to those already considered: there may be a mindful attentivenessto the content of received teaching, leading to an immediate \"fading away\" of phe-nomenal suffering, or the nonintentional recovery of mind's ground, aroused by therecognition that the \"bewildered appearances of dream are just mind's own light,\"and involving the \"release\" of subject and object.(145.1-4) \"The trio of womb, sleep, and the intermediate state, are envisioned asone in essence: this is repeatedly envisioned [through] mnemic engagement, in whichthe succession of discursive thought has not arisen. If one thinks that mnemic en-gagement becomes discursive thought,23 then [in response to that objection it maybe affirmed that] discursive thought is that successive mnemic engagement thatpursues external objects. The genuine mnemic engagement associated with the dhar-makaya is not lost in succession and is free from obsessive attachment.

The self-emergent body of essential reality(= Skt. svabhavikakaya) being comprehended, realization is at hand when objectsarise.\"25 The reflexive mnemic engagement of mind in its ground is not to be con-strued as a sort of trance-like oblivion. Emergent objects are neither forgotten norforsaken, but now are revalued as reminders, signaling mind's potential straying intobewilderment to mind itself, and thus continually arousing its capacity for genuinemnemic engagement.Chapter 8: The Attainment ofBuddhahood duringthe Intermediate State(147.2-3) \"As soon as you part from this physical body, then just as darkness isdispelled at dawn, you become mnemically engaged in the esoteric precepts of thethree temporal phases of the intermediate state.

In the absence of a formal treatise explicitlydevoted to dran-, we are nevertheless entitled to maintain that the texts under con-sideration do present a relatively well-formed doctrine of \"memory.\" The occurrencesof dran- found here may be gathered into four primary categories, which I have sum-marized, enumerating the passages that I believe represent the uses in question. Thefirst of these categories is quite general. Passages listed under more than one head-ing either include several distinctive occurrences of the terms under consideration,or, in a few instances involving uses B and C, seem reasonably subject to eitherinterpretation:A. Mnemic engagement (dran-pd) = mnemic acts (i.e., memory, recollection, recog-nition, etc.) that are determinations of the domain of mundane possibilities, orsamsara: 138.3, 145.1-4.B. Mnemic engagement (dran-pd) - mindful attentiveness (directed upon whatevercontributes to advancement on the path): 137.5, 138.6-139.1, 141.3-4, 144.3-6,145.1-4, 147.2-3.C. Mnemic engagement (dran-pd) - immediate recovery of the self-presentingawareness of the dharmakaya: 138.6-139.1, 141.3-4, 142.6, 144.3-6, 145.1-4,146.2.D. Amnesis (dran-med) = negatively valued engagement in discursive thought,oblivion with respect to primordial awareness. (Let us note that dran-med, as thenegation of B. and especially of C., refers to discursive engagement constitutingthe bewilderment of samsara, so that in one sense D. dran-med, is equivalent toA. dran-pa. As the Prayer of Great Power also makes clear, amnesis marksa drifting away from the original ground of awareness on the part of sentientbeings.]: 141.2-3.We may note too that in some contexts dran-med may be said, quite oppositely, tocharacterize the practice of the path, referring in this case, it seems, to contemplative\"oblivion\" marked by freedom from discursive thought (i.e., freedom from A. dran-pa). Godem in fact uses dran-med in this fashion in several passages I've located,though not in the tantra considered here.28 We shall refer to this as:E. amnesis (dran-med). (Because this is not much emphasized in the texts we areconsidering, it is bracketed in table 2.)In elaborating our account further, it seems essential that we address at once animportant objection, for we have not yet shown that the various significations of thedran- derivatives found here do indeed have some common semantic or conceptualcore. Some might object that we are dealing not with a unified concept, but with theuse of a single lexeme to refer to a number of genuinely distinct concepts that, for"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Amnesic Monarch and the Five Mnemic Men 185one reason or another, are often accidentally associated with one another. The asso-ciation of both memory and mindfulness with the Sanskrit root srnr- is often thoughtof as an instance of just such a phenomenon. I believe that, in this instance, the ob-jection will not hold; dran- in Great Perfection thought represents a univocal but highlyabstract concept, with reference to which the various dran- derivatives surveyed heremay all be understood.To see how this is so, let us consider the three fundamental significations of dran-pa just noted, and the two of dran-med, in their relationships to one another and to thecategories of ground (gzhi), path (lam), and result ('bras-bu). We may further distin-guish between two process categories, termed cosmogonic and soteriological. Cosmog-onic process embraces, in classical Buddhist terms, the truths of suffering and its ori-gin, while soteriological process pertains to the extinction of suffering, nirvana, andthe path whereby that is achieved. The interrelationships among the terms and catego-ries with which we are concerned may be illustrated schematically (tab. 2).The arrow indicates a weak relationship of conditionality: \"A —» B\" means here,roughly, that \"A is generally a necessary condition for the occurrence or realizationof B.\" Of course, in some cases, a stronger relationship may also be affirmed: theprimordial awareness of the ground is the condition sine qua non for all modes ofawareness, for example; and A. dran-pa, is certainly a necessary condition forB. dran-pa, which is to say only that there must be some mnemic intentions presentif there are to be any soteriologically valuable mnemic intentions. The relationshipof conditionality presupposed here is useful in that it permits one to plot out a se-quential ordering of the cosmogonic and soteriological processes—the ways of be-wilderment and liberation (sems-can 'khrul-lugs, sangs-rgyas grol-lugs)—that wellaccords with what is in fact set forth in traditional expositions. This is first and fore-most a matter of exegetical convenience, providing a generalized and idealized mapof the path.The proposed schematization, whatever its other defects may be, does suggest anobservation of some consequence here, emphasizing what we may designate theprimacy of amnesis. Amnesis (D. dran-med), as the loss of, or deviation from, theprimordial awareness of the ground, must be regarded as the first of all mnemic phe-nomena. This determines a proper understanding of mnemic engagement (dran-pa),for we must now say that all acts of mnemic engagement involve the apparent re-covery or retention, that is to say nonloss, of a causally or temporally precedent psy-chic or experiential condition by an act of awareness. Memory, for instance, is nowdetermined to be the mind's recovery or retention of, and is presumed to be causallyrelated to, the content of prior experience; recognition, the cognition that one hasrecovered the object of prior perception; recollection, the recovery of knowledgeacquired earlier; memorization, the deliberate retention of knowledge; mindfulness,the retention of awareness's specifically appropriate engagement in a given act orexperience. (In this last case, what counts as \"specifically appropriate\" will neces-sarily vary according to the nature of the act or experience concerned: a chainsawoperator's mindfulness will involve a rather differently specified sort of engagementthan will that of a practitioner of ikibana.)\"Recovery,\" \"retention,\" and \"loss\" are here, admittedly, metaphorical terms, butthis seems not to present grave difficulties in the present context. \"Loss\" may beunderstood phenomenologically as the alienation of the subject from any of its ap-"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Table 2.

Regarded in this way, it appears not at all strange that \"memory\" and \"mindful-ness\" have often been gathered together under a single lexical head—e.g., mna-,smr-, or dran and rather odd that this convention has sometimes been thoughtproblematic. Although the normal temporal reference of memory to the past is some-times not a feature of the codesignated phenomena in question, we nonetheless findin these cases a relatively straightforward analogy of intention.To the foregoing considerations, our sources further suggest that when awarenessturns not to the ground of any particular act, but to the ground of all possible acts ofawareness, it reaches its end in the reflexive recovery of the pristine gnosis of theground-of-all (kun-gzhi 'i ye-shes) that is the dharmakaya in its noetic aspect. Herethe analogy with \"memory\" as we ordinarily conceive of it is found solely in thephenomenon of recovery, but the character of the act in question has neither the tem-poral nor the intentional properties of the quotidian concept. In its most characteris-tic sense, then, dran- in Great Perfection thought as represented by Rikdzin Gb'demrefers to awareness qua awareness orienting itself to its proper ground. Its primary\"referent,\" the \"object\" of this act of retention/recovery, is the self-presentation ofawareness as dharmakaya; and it is by analogy that all mnemic acts, by virtue of theirorientation to their proper ground or some part thereof, counteracting \"loss\" or \"de-viation,\" are equally dran-pa.An Allegorical Re-presentationThe Penetration of Samantabhadra 's Intention and its allied literature are, on thesurface at least, extremely repetitive compilations; the topics we've seen surveyedin the brief tantra just discussed are variously restated, with more or less elaboration,in many of the texts forming the corpus of the Penetration of Samantabhadra'sIntention. The repetitiveness of these works, however, betokens no want of ingenu-ity on the part of the redactor; for this represents in part a carefully crafted effort toclarify and reinforce the vision of the Great Perfection. Repetition, in short, func-tions mnemotechnically.29 As the preceding section makes clear, it is part of thesoteriological strategy of the Great Perfection to arouse mnemic engagement of atype that, indirectly or immediately, re-calls, calls one back to an object of loss, therevelation of the dharmakaya qua self-presenting awareness. The mnemotechnicsof the literature and practice of the Great Perfection must be seen as contributingto the formation of such soteriologically valued mnemic engagement. In this andthe section which follows, we shall examine two aspects of the mnemotechnic strate-gies that are employed here: allegorization and ritualization.The Wide Open Tantra of Universal Liberation exemplifies the character ofmuch abstract Great Perfection discourse: like certain aspects of Indian Buddhistabhidharma, it employs what in many respects is a sort of phenomenological lan-guage whose operating terms are to be understood as signifying empirical phenom-ena that are revealed and clarified only when one becomes engaged in appropriatetypes of contemplative abstraction.30 One of the functions of allegory, of course, isto render an abstract message more memorable by recasting it in terms of the con-crete relationships portrayed as holding among fictitious agents.31 Allegorical narra-"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"188 Myth, Memory, Revelationlive, like mythic and historical narrative, may seek to overcome the atemporal char-acter of more highly abstracted modes of discourse, disclosing to us what that dis-course had situated outside of time in an abode phenomenologically rather like thatof human temporal experience. Ironically, therefore, allegorical narrative (\"the fig-ure of false semblance,\" as it was known to the Renaissance) may be employed as acorrective to a distortion inseparable from much philosophical language—we maysay, to a lie of philosophical language, the lie of timelessness.The teaching of the Penetration of Samantabhadra's Intention is given allegori-cal expression in the sixth chapter of a tantra entitled the 'Khrul-pa rtsad-gcod-kyirgyud (The Tantra of the Eradication of Bewilderment), whose importance in thecorpus as a whole is signaled by the description of the text as \"the first of all tantrasof the esoteric instructions of the Great Perfection.\"32 The chapter that interests ushere is called \"The Symbolic [i.e., Allegorical] Teaching of the Authentic and RealIntroduction to the Abiding Nature of Mind and the Approach to the Path of Purifi-cation.\"33 Because, for reasons argued earlier, the attempt to separate the particularsymbolic figures met here from their narrative context would necessarily miss thevery point of their employment in narrative, the chapter is presented in its entirety.Readers may find this text to be confusing in parts, but, bewilderment being pre-cisely an aspect of experience that it seeks to underscore, it would be, I think, insome respects misleading to attempt to clarify it through editorial abridgement oralteration.34The Lord of Secrets petitioned the Teacher Vajrasattva: \"O Body of Perfect Rapture!Teacher Vajrasattva! Concerning the so-called 'mind of sentient being,' is it the casethat, even though other names be attributed to it, it comes into being from the groundof arising because of varied agitations? And is it the case that there is a differencebetween the mind autonomously engaged in the afflicted states and the mind of theindividual who has embarked on the path of the bodhisattva?\"In response, [Vajrasattva] declared: \"This so-called mind is most exceedingly mi-raculous! Its potencies and enumerations are inconceivable, beyond speech. Nonethe-less, this so-called mind is spontaneously present, though of indeterminate materialcause. The contributory condition is ignorance. Its essential characteristic is such thatit can become anything. At first, when the appearance of twofold apprehension [ofsubject and object] is vaguely set in motion, one may speak of 'precedent intellectualcognition,' or 'doubtful thought,' or 'pride-generating sensation.' Then, when that hascoarsened, there is the bifurcation of outer and inner, the vessel [of the world] and itscontents [that is, sentient beings]. When the residues have extensively developed, onemay speak of 'the intermediate state of imaginative cognition,' 'dualistic bewilder-ment,' or 'the ramification of the residues of action.' Thence proceeds samsara. Whenthe body of a sentient being is acquired, one speaks of 'the mind that constructs allbewildered appearance.' It is that which apprehends bewildered appearance as anautonomous continuum. That is the King of All Bewilderment.\"Though he performs many deeds, without associates he remains at leisure. He hasfive ministers, the greatest of whom is stubborn, speaks indistinctly, is derisive to-wards all, and obscure. His name is Stupidity. When that minister and the king enterinto consultation, the whole country is thrown into blackness. Following him, there isone [characterized by] clear mnemic engagement, who rushes about to and fro.

Whenhe and the king enter into consultation, they wreck everything they see, touch, or oth-erwise handle. Following him, there's one with great words and little skill. He bringsabout self-regard and blame of others. His name is Pride. When he and the king enterinto consultation, disregarding subjects and property, there's only self-regard. The lastcauses only selfish desire. He takes everything he sees to be an enemy and accordswith no one. His name is Envy. When he and the king enter into consultation, every-one becomes an enemy. Those are the five afflictions. Serving under those five min-isters are eighty-four thousand slaves who conform with them. They are called 'thehost of adventitious afflicted thoughts.' They emanate from the mind that is an au-tonomous continuum of affliction.\"Now, if a fortunate individual emerges who enters into [the cultivation of] theenlightened mind, then the so-called inception of pure pristine gnosis occurs:\"At some interval, when the five ministers are not in the presence of the Omni-creative King of Mind, a man may come forth to teach in symbols the purification ofmnemic engagement [that pertains to] desire for and subjective apprehension of whatmay be [srid-pa chags-'dzin dran-pa'i dag-pa], saying, 'You, king, were alone evenbefore the first origins of what may be. When you fell asleep and became bewilderedyou met with associates [who arrived] from here and there. They altered your mind,making the king as you are today, by affirming the being of what is not. Therefore,through the power of deeds, you've been made to consult with the five ruinous min-isters. Now, many incompetent functionaries have assembled, one such as yourself ispresent, and these evil courtiers have transformed you, so that you've fallen, withoutautonomy, into unbearable suffering. You must wake up! Being deceived by me, youmust go off without associates. What can you do with a retinue like this? If you listento me, you'll just abandon this ruinous retinue. There's the one called the Friend whois a Pure Antidote, into association with whom I'll place you. Joining forces with him,without separation, run off with your thoughts bent on the Three Gems Blazing withLight that are found in the upper valley. That way, O king, you'll be happy both im-mediately and ultimately. Then waking up, you'll come to be undeceived.'—So hespoke.\"Then the king, freeing his mind, renounced all the retinue and his ministers, and,undetected by anyone, joined together with the Friend who is a Pure Antidote. Direct-ing his thoughts to the Gems at the head of the valley, he fled and, though pursued byhis servants and ministers, escaped in an instant. Such is the entranceway accordingto the lower vehicle. So it is that in the lower vehicle, the king whose mind has givenbirth to an attitude of renunciation has only the single friend, Pure Antidote.\"In entering upon the path of the higher vehicle, there are, just as described above,the king of the mental continuum, with his servants and ministers. At some time anadviser comes forth and addresses him as follows: 'O king, listen to me. Formerly, inthe city of Vaisali, the universal ground, there was a prince called Luminous Essence.He had a wish-fulfilling gem from which all desired qualities naturally emerged. Atsome point that great city was destroyed, there was the terrifying roar of a thousandthunders, and all was scattered to the wind. The tornado that demolished the palacetook the form of a brilliant conflagration and the prince became senseless, lost hiscomposure, and, terrified, fled in a state of oblivion. Arriving in a district in a neigh-boring land, he met an old woman with cataracts. The old woman took the prince to"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"190 Myth, Memory, Revelationher home and dressed him in thick garments. The prince, exhausted, fell asleep, andthe old woman stole the precious gem that he wore beneath his shirt. That thief thenfled into the darkness, where she met up with five men. The old woman got to talkingwith them and lost the gem to those five men, who couldn't hold on to it either and sosold it in the six cities of deeds. There, in the desire to worship the gem without theprince, the six cities shared it; but when the desired objects failed to appear in [those]six dungeons, it was abandoned.\"'At that time the prince awoke and, the old woman not having returned, he wasamazed and ran out the door. [On his meeting] a man named \"Self-Manifest Bewil-derment,\" the two conversed. [The prince's] mind, unaccustomed [to the condition inwhich he found himself], entered into dualistic apprehension, whereupon many moti-vational bandits arrived and kidnapped the prince. They sold him in a city of perver-sity, which was princeless, and the prince was appointed lord of that land. At that, oneadviser came forth and said, \"I've come to give you a message, for I've heard aboutyour incessant suffering, due to the five ministers who ruined everything, along withthe eighty-four thousand subjects who created meaningless pain. At that time you werethe king. Now, what is it that you're doing?\"'\"The prince made his previous pain an object of mnemic engagement and weptuntil he was exhausted. \"Alas, alas! I have no friends,\" he cried. At that the advisersaid, \"At first you were the owner of the precious gem. So it's impossible that you'rewithout a pouch for the gem, or perhaps some garment that came into contact with thegem. Examine your body!\"'\"The prince found that there was a cord for the gem around his neck that reachedhis heart. Cutting it into five pieces, he made the gem an object of mnemic engage-ment and prayed to it, whereupon, by the blessing of the gem, five heartlike men cameforth. The adviser spoke as follows: \"The eldest of the five men should be appointedto be the Guardian of Inseparable Mnemic Engagement (dran-pa 'bral-med-kyi so-pa). Without separation from him, whatever you do will be easy. Next, there is onecalled Impermanence That Reveals the Fault of the Round ('khor-ba 'i mtshang- 'don-gyi mi-rtag-pa). Without separation from him, you needn't wander in evil abodes. Thisnext one is called the Person Who Is the Self-clarification of Cognition (shes-pa rang-gsal-gyi skyes-bu).

The next one is called the Sentinel of Mnemic Engagement and Mindfulnesswith Respect to the Manifest Fluctuations of One's Evil Residues (bag-chags ngan-pa'iyo-lang 'don-pa-la dran-pa shes-bzhin-gyi byar-bd). Without separation from him,whatever you do will come out well. The youngest one is called the Messenger of theConnection Between Samsara and Nirvana ('khor- 'das mtshams-sbyor-gyi phrin-pa).Without separation from him, you and I will meet repeatedly. Never let yourself beseparated from these five mnemic men! Now you must change your name. You haveparted ways with the retinue of ruin. As for the manner in which misery arose so longas you were alienated from your original homeland, you must continually practicemnemic engagement with respect to the heartfelt advice I've now given to you. Mayyou bear the name 'Youth of Awareness!'\"'\"When he had spoken thus, the youth and the five mnemic men became constantcompanions. They captured the five thieves and imprisoned them. They vanquishedall the retinue and subjects. They demolished the six cities and stole back the gem.They killed the old woman with cataracts. Having returned to his former land, theprince, together with the five mnemic men, were united with the precious gem. Inthe pinnacle of the castle the first of the five mnemic men was appointed watchman."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The Amnesic Monarch and the Five Mnemic Men 191The next was appointed guard at the door of the royal apartments. The next one, ac-companying the prince and the gem, was appointed to reside at the center of the for-tress and became inseparable from them. The next was assigned to be a hero, a tamerof enemies. The next was assigned to be a fleet-footed messenger, incessantly arrang-ing for princely audiences with the gracious adviser. So it was that the prince's landachieved a stable ground, and the various desires were fulfilled.'\"It is said that afterwards there was nothing to fear in that land. And it is said thatsometimes messengers were dispatched, to guide men who wished to reach that landon the path.'\"That is the manner of entry into the higher vehicle. Such is the allegory concern-ing the need of the Youth of Self-presenting Awareness for the five self-emergent as-sociates who are mnemic engagement.\" So he said.Thus the sixth chapter of the tantra of bewilderment and mind, which teaches as anallegory the genuinely meaningful introduction to the abiding nature of mind, and themanner of entry into the pure path.The allegory in its two versions, pertaining to the \"lower\" and \"higher\" vehicles,35involves considerable complexity of detail, so that remarks here must be limited toaddressing only a few elements that are especially pertinent in the present context.The Prayer of Great Power, translated in the appendix to this chapter, will providea key that, I believe, together with some knowledge of the classical Buddhist doc-trine of dependent origination (rten-cing 'brel-bar 'byung-ba, pratityasamutpada)and the material presented in the section above on the 'Wide-Open Tantra of Uni-versal Liberation, will help the reader to decipher many of the particular symbolicallusions.Both versions of the allegory emphasize a reorientation involving mnemicengagement, a reorientation aroused by the appearance of a benevolent adviserat the decisive turning point of the monarch's troubled career: starting here, theincreasingly ramified network of affliction begins to come undone. The narrativefulcrum of the allegories is thus found at the point at which soteriologically valu-able mnemic engagement (B. dran-pd) is born within the obscure domain of be-wilderment ('khml-pa). Deception, as these allegories clearly illustrate, must there-fore be part of the inception and development of the path. The notion of deception(bslu-bd) that we find here is notably similar to the concept of upayakausalya,\"skillful means,\" famously revealed in the Lotus Sutra's \"Parable of the BurningHouse.\"36Given the essential constitution of the round of samsara as bewilderment, determinedthroughout by amnesis, it seems clear that this concession to deception is in fact re-quired: honest recognition of the limitations of ordinary discourse, as that is conceivedhere, and not cynical manipulation of the faithful, demands such a concession.With this in mind, the purpose of the apparently strange emboitement of several speak-ers' discourses in the second allegory becomes clear; for, without explicit referenceto deception, the inclusion of allegory within allegory self-referentially betokensthe text's own deceptiveness, so that one need be no longer deceived by it.37The technique of allegorical emboitement, generating the functional equivalentof a metalanguage, permits the disclosure of deception to take place without its in-volving the obvious circularity of the liar paradox. The narrative's allegorized self-reference further reinforces the allegorical passage from lower to higher vehicle, in"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"192 Myth, Memory, Revelationwhich the self-referentiality of awareness is itself disclosed and characterized as theinalienable possession of mnemic engagement, embodied now as the Self-Clarifica-tion of Cognition, third (and so central) among the mnemic men. Thus, allegory re-capitulates the course we have previously traversed in preeminently doctrinal terms,and in so doing it reminds us that the actual path will be disclosed symbolically; forthe intentional character of symbolic discourse is at once the mark of bewildermentand the conveyance of the antidote for it.Before leaving the allegory of the amnesic monarch, it may be worth noting thestriking resemblance that it bears to the celebrated Gnostic text \"The Hymn of thePearl.\"38 The narrator of the hymn is a prince, sent by his royal parents to Egypt to\"bring back the One Pearl which lies in the middle of the sea.\" Arriving in Egypt, heis treated rather badly:[SJomehow they learnedI was not their countryman,and they dealt with me cunninglyand gave me their food to eat.I forgot that I was the son of kings,and served their king.I forgot the pearlfor which my parents had sent me.Through the heaviness of their foodI fell into a deep sleep.39Recognizing the prince's plight, his parents and \"the kings and princes of Parthia\"send a collective letter to him, which reads in part:Awake and rise from your sleepand hear the words of our letter!Remember that you are a son of Kingsand see the slavery of your life.Remember the pearlfor which you went into Egypt!40The prince, once awakened, defeats the terrible serpent who guards the pearl, seizesit, and frees himself from the impure garments of the Egyptians, thereby achievingthe glory of gnosis.Is the apparent parallelism of these two allegories of awakening a fortuitous acci-dent, or the result of the transmission of gnostic lore, of \"Gnosis on the Silk Road,\"to borrow Klimkeit's phrase? Herbert Guenther, investigating seemingly gnosticelements in several Great Perfection allegorical texts, has recently advanced the lat-ter alternative, while insisting nevertheless upon \"not only the close connection, butalso the tremendous difference that existed between early rD/ogs-chen thought andHellenistic-Gnostic ideas.\" This difference, he argues, lies in part in the \"dualismthat reflected [the Gnostic's] restrict!vely rational approach to the question ofBeing. By contrast, the rDzogs-chen thinkers ... being process-oriented in their think-ing could not but conceive of the origin of the world as a self-organizing processwhose success or failure was a matter of comprehension or incomprehension on thepart of the experiencer as an integral aspect of this process.\"41"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The Amnesic Monarch and the Five Mnemic Men 193As tantalizing as indeed it is to find suggestions of a religious dialogue unfoldingbetween two greatly differing traditions supposed to have been nevertheless inter-acting to some extent in late antiquity, the historical framework for such exchangeremains largely a matter of speculation.42 Still, given what we have said earlier re-garding Tibet's far-flung cultural relationships, we would be rash to discount suchpossibilities altogether.Mnemic Engagement in the Practice of PrayerWhile the study and practice of the Great Perfection traditions emanating fromRikdzin Godem have been traditionally maintained among lineages of highly trainedreligious specialists within particular branches of the Nyingmapa sect, includingboth laypersons and celibate clergy, there is one short litany derived from the Pen-etration of Samantabhadra's Intention that is known and practiced throughout theTibetan Buddhist world. This is the Smon-lam stobs-po-che (The Prayer of GreatPower), a text without parallel in Tibetan Buddhist literature, whose peculiar popu-larity was perhaps from the beginning part of its intention. The text, translated inthe appendix to this chapter, aims to reveal the manner in which the awakenedintention of the original buddha Samantabhadra literally penetrates the universeof sentient beings, and in its original context the Prayer of Great Power occurs notas a self-contained work, but rather as the penultimate (and so possibly culminat-ing) chapter of a very extensive tantra.43 The title of the chapter in which it is givenis \"The Teaching of the Inability of Sentient Beings Not to Become Buddhas, onReciting the Prayer of Great Power.\"44The Prayer of Great Power is of interest in part because it recasts several of thefundamental elements commonly attributed to prayer, while at the same time con-forming to normative conventions in important respects. How this is so may be madeclear with reference to the brief phenomenology of prayer suggested by Gerardusvan der Leeuw,45 who begins his account by considering the relationship betweenprayer and magical formulae, the efficacious recitation of which always demandsthat they be repeated with perfect accuracy. Their power may be enhanced by addi-tional factors, too, especially by the introduction of what van der Leeuw terms the\"magical antecedent,\" often a mythical narrative invoking the past efficacy of theformula concerned. Again, we find incorporated in prayer exclamations that origi-nally served to summon the deity, or \"to remind the god of the pact that had beenconcluded,\" and even to \"compel the presence of divine Power.\"Prayer, properly speaking, emerges \"[w]hen man recognizes first of all Form, andlater Will, within Power.\" These are among the key terms of van der Leeuw's phe-nomenology of religion, and elsewhere he explains that \"in the three terms Power,Will and Form, there lies practically the entire concept of the the Object of Religion,\"that is to say, whatever object is deemed \"sacred.\"46 The recognition of Form andWill here gives rises to the characteristically dialogic aspect of prayer: \"it is an ad-dress from man to the Will which he knows to be above him, and the reply of thisWill.\" Finally, in mystical faith, prayer may lose its dialogic character and become\"a monologue saturated with religious energy,\" a \"merging in God.\" \"[PJrayer at-tains its highest form in submersion, while the dialogue type of supplication, on the"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"194 Myth, Memory, Revelationother hand, always remains word and entreaty, practical demonstration of Will towill, even when it prays in its highest form: 'not my will, but thine, be done.'\"It will be seen at once that the phenomena of prayer are thoroughly bound up withmnemonics: perfect accuracy of recitation necessitates perfect recall; the \"magicalantecedent\" involves the recollection of past events; the exclamatory summoning ofthe deity requires both summoner and summoned to remember their compact; dia-logic prayer presupposes the petitioner's recollection of the object of faith; andmystical prayer presupposes the exercise of mindful self-collection. In the Prayer ofGreat Power, all of these elements, with interesting variations, are in evidence. More-over, the prayer traces a path through the cosmogony and soteriology of amnesis andmnemic engagement.The relationship of the prayer we are considering to magical power is made ex-plicit even in its title and is further asserted in its concluding passage, in which themost propitious times for recital are described. The \"magical antecedent,\" a remem-brance of mythical events, is incorporated into the main body of the text itself, whichdetails the manner in which the awakening of the primordial Buddha and the amnesisof sentient beings have orginated in a common ground. The exclamations ho! andaho! used throughout Tibetan religious poetry and prayer are intended always to recalla sense of awe and wonderment, and the ejaculation tsitta a! with which this prayeris introduced uniquely recalls the primordial purity (ka-dag) of the Great Perfection.Where the Prayer of Great Power curiously departs from the examples examinedby van der Leeuw, however, is in its remarkable simultaneous instantiation of bothdialogic and mystical paradigms: the petitioner reestablishes a primordial relation-ship with the buddha Samantabhadra by becoming Samantabhadra. The mnemonicsof prayer are thus called upon to reawaken one's original affinity with the dharmakaya,that is to say, to arouse the reflexive mnemic engagement of the dharmakaya, to in-troduce a convergence of will and Will. According to its own logic, then, all beingsare indeed powerless not to become buddhas upon reciting this prayer; and that is itsmagic and power.By Way of ConclusionThe foregoing reflections on dran-pa in Great Perfection thought suggest that weindeed find here a distinctive doctrine of \"memory\" that is by no means a simplereiteration of classical Indian Buddhist materials. It is equally clear, however, thatthis doctrine does not represent a decisive break with the earlier tradition. In thisrespect, the Great Perfection treatment of dran-pa is consistent with many of the otherelements incorporated into Great Perfection thought: the resonances of Indian Bud-dhist teachings are deliberately appropriated, while particular nuances are carefullyrefined, but in such a manner that the passage from normative Buddhist sources tothe peculiar realm of the Great Perfection is rendered quite seamless. It is preciselyin virtue of this strategy that the various attempts to forge a scholastic synthesisfounded on the Great Perfection tradition, for instance, in the writings of Karma Pakshiand Longchen Rabjampa, are synthetic achievements and not mere eclecticism.47 Tothis, however, the adherents of the Great Perfection would add that their strategy worksso well precisely because Great Perfection thought gets us closer to the bedrock of"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The Amnesic Monarch and the Five Mnemic Men 195Buddhist insight than do its competitors, and so best comprehends the genuine in-sights of particular Buddhist traditions.It remains a peculiar feature of the Great Perfection approach to \"memory\" that itemphasizes above all a type of psychological act that stands quite apart from boththe intentional character and the temporal reference we usually attribute to memory.And this, we have seen, goes far beyond the appropriation of mindfulness to memoryterms, for in such cases the analogical rapport of the intentionality of the former actwith that of properly mnemic phenomena seems relatively clear. The puzzlement thatis occasioned for us by the Great Perfection transposition of the phenomenologicalheart of the mnemic act to the reflexivity of awareness is deepened, perhaps, whenwe remark that the Great Perfection tradition has not been alone in its execution ofthis striking maneuver.48 Consider in this respect the argument of Augustine:But some one will say, That is not memory by which the mind, which is ever presentto itself, is affirmed to remember itself; for memory is of things past, not of thingspresent. For there are some, and among them Cicero, who, in treating of the virtues,have divided prudence into these three—memory, understanding, forethought: to wit,assigning memory to things past, understanding to things present, forethought to thingsfuture; which last is certain only in the case of those who are prescient of the future;and this is no gift of men, unless it be granted from above, as to the prophets. Andhence the book of Wisdom speaking of men, \"The thoughts of mortals,\" it says, \"arefearful, and our forethought uncertain.\" But memory of things past, and understand-ing of things present, are certain: certain, I mean, respecting things incorporeal, whichare present; for things corporeal are present to the sight of the corporeal eyes. But letany one who denies that there is any memory of things present, attend to the languageused even in profane literature, where exactness of words was more looked for thantruth of things, \"Nor did Ulysses suffer such things, nor did the Ithacan forget himselfin so great a peril.\" For when Virgil said that Ulysses did not forget himself, what elsedid he mean, except that he remembered himself? And since he was present to him-self, he could not possibly remember himself, unless memory pertained to thingspresent. And, therefore, as that which is called memory in things past which makes itpossible to recall and remember them; so in a thing present, as the mind is to itself,that is not unreasonably to be called memory, which makes the mind at hand to itself,so that it can be understood by its own thought, and then both be joined together bylove of itself.49And a contemporary Augustine scholar comments:Augustine extends the scope of memoria so as to include all that we are capable ofgetting to know explicitly that does not come to us through sense-experience. Thisincludes, for Augustine, knowledge of self, of the truths of reason, of moral and othervalues, of God. Hence memoria loses all reference to the past, except in the case ofknowledge derived from sense experience, since the content of this is only in the mindif the experience has in fact occurred at some previous time; otherwise, memoria isnot confined to past experience but embraces all that is latent and present as such inthe mind. (Emphasis in original.)50The redescription of memory as all that is present as such in the mind, or as themnemic engagement of the dharmakaya and thus standing outside of time, despitethe manifold differences between Augustinian thought and that of the Great Perfec-"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"196 Myth, Memory, Revelationtion traditions with respect to perhaps most matters of \"theology,\"51 serves in eachcase to ground the role of \"memory\" in a religious epistemology, in part by shortcircuiting the doubts frequently raised about the relationship between memory andknowledge: memory is here revealed to be the mast natural thing in the world and,hence, absolutely authoritative. One may well be tempted to suppose that Augustineand the masters of Great Perfection were indeed on to something here, that their as-sertion that memory is so very much more than a doubtful relationship between anevanescent present and a forever lost past is a real insight, in fact, a discovery. I aminclined to think that it is plausible to view matters in this way; but, still, philosophi-cal scruples require that the most skeptical objections be heard. Let us consider theterrible words of Nietzsche on the subject of memory:[PJerhaps indeed there was nothing more fearful and uncanny in the whole prehistoryof man than his mnemotechnics.... Man could never do without blood, torture, andsacrifices when he felt the need to create a memory for himself; the most dreadfulsacrifices and pledges (sacrifices of the first-born among them), the most repulsivemutilations (castration, for example), the crudest rites of all the religious cults (andall religions are at the deepest levels systems of cruelties)—all this has its origin inthe instinct that realized that pain is the most powerful aid to mnemonics.In a certain sense, the whole of asceticism belongs here: a few ideas are to be ren-dered inextinguishable, ever-present, unforgettable, \"fixed,\" with the aim of hypno-tising the entire nervous and intellectual system with these \"fixed ideas\"—and asceticprocedures and modes of life are means of freeing these ideas from the competition ofall other ideas, so as to make them \"unforgettable.\"(Emphasis added.)52Nietzsche perhaps did not perceive the highest degree of subtlety to which mnemo-technics have aspired: with the insight that memory is the most natural thing in theworld, we may dispense with all mnemonic torture; the bond linking pain and memorymay at last be severed.A genuine discovery, then, or the most exquisite possible refinement of ascesis?According to what principle is this puzzle to be resolved? I shall have to leave it forthe reader to ponder; possibly this will serve as an invitation to memoria, to genuinedran-pa."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"AppendixThe Prayer of Great PowerTsitta A!

For investigations of re-lated issues in the history of Western thought, see Taylor 1989; Hatab 1990; Nussbaum 1990.4. Scharfstein 1989 offers a perceptive essay on this question.5. As Lopez rightly argues (1998, p. 4): \"the play of opposites has been both extreme andvolatile in the case of Tibet, and it remains at work in contemporary attitudes toward Tibetand Tibetan Buddhism.\""},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 4-5 2056. Tenzin Gyatso 1975, pp. 21-22, states this unequivocally: \"Thus, the Buddhist teach-ing that spread to Tibet is just the stainless teaching of India and nothing else. The Tibetanlamas neither altered it nor mixed it with another religion.\" H. H. the Dalai Lama's per-spective is, of course, precisely the normative viewpoint among those educated within thetradition.7. Thus rang-bzo, literally \"personal invention,\" is almost always mentioned as a nega-tive quality. A commentator assures his readers of the reliability and authority of his work byproclaiming it to be rang-bzo-med-pa, \"without personal invention.\"8. During the 19th century, this was the view commonly held with regard to \"lamaism,\"a designation that accentuated the notion that Tibetan Buddhism had moved so far fromBuddhism's sources that it was no longer really Buddhism at all. Lopez 1998, ch. 1, reviewsthe history of the idea of \"lamaism\" in depth.9. This is not to say that there were no Tibetans who invented the teachings or texts theywere said to have transmitted. The problem comes to the fore in the study of the revealedscriptural \"treasures\" (gter-ma), on which see ch. 7, 8.10. Thus Samuel 1993, p. 446, holds that there was an \"accommodation between Bud-dhism and shamanic religion. Buddhism was acceptable as a new improved shamanic tech-nique, which would maintain the good fortune and welfare of the country without threaten-ing the established order laid down in the past.\"11.

They are duly noted, for example, in the influential pilgrimage guide of' Jam-dbyangsMkhyen-brtse (1820-1892): Ferrari 1958, pp. 13-14 (text), 52-53 (trans.).17. For instance, in the tale of the first mortal king, Gri-gum btsan-po, as given in OTC,ch. 1, it is clear that his violent death creates a grave problem that is related to the question ofthe proper disposal of his corpse, which seems to exist in a sort of limbo until last rites arecorrectly performed. But there is no description here of the condition of his soul followinghis death, either before or after the last rites are achieved. The problem of the dead is here onefor the descendants and others who remain.18. Blondeau 1997.19. The comments of E. G. Smith 1968 on the emergence of the institution of rebirth asa preeminent means of monastic succession remain seminal here. He argues that it was in factonly in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that lineages of rebirth achieved priority \"overfamilial claims in the transmission of accumulated religious prestige and wealth.\" Thoughwe do find evidence that religious figures as early as the eleventh century were sometimesthought to be the incarnations of earlier masters—see, for example, Dudjom 1991, vol. 1,pp. 703-709, on Rong-zom-pa; Kapstein 1997b on Khyung-po Rnal-'byor; Kapstein in presson 'Brom-ston Rgyal-ba'i 'byung-gnas—the crucial shift that later takes place is the applica-tion of such identifications to actual questions of inheritance."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"206 Notes to Pages 6-1020. 'Od- 'bar-rgyal. The name appears to be modeled on that of the god Vimalatejahprabha(Pure Splendrous Light), whose death is the point of departure for the Sarvadurgatiparisod-hanatantra (edited in Skorupski 1983). The probable influence of the latter on the Cycle ofBirth and Death is discussed in Kapstein in press.21. The name is given as Rin-chen-lag[s], which may be equivalent to Sanskrit *Ratnapani,\"Jewel-in-hand.\" Stein 1983, however, has argued with some plausibility that the Tibetanshould probably be Rin-chen-legs, in which case this is likely a translation of the Chineserendering of the name Sudhana, the hero of the Gandavyuhasutra, which in Tibetan transla-tions from the Sanskrit is Nor-bzang. As Imaeda has shown, the Cycle of Birth and Death isvery much influenced by the Gandavyuha.22. Translated following the text as given in Imaeda 1981b, pp. 87-90.23. Collins 1982, ch. 1.24.

Itwas presented at the Colloque Franco-Japonais, \"1'adaptation du bouddhismes aux cultureslocales,\" at the College de France, Paris, in September 1991.28. PT 239, plates 2-8.29. This is particularly suggestive in the light of Collins 1998, on nirvana and other \"fe-licities,\" such as the heavens, in the Theravada traditions.30. The progression of the deceased from the peaceful realm of Indra to the wrathfuldomain of Vajrapani perhaps offers a precedent to the visionary encounters with peacefuland wrathful deities that become a central motif in the Bar-do thos-grol.31. PT 239, plates 14-19.32. For translations, see Evans-Wentz 1960 (originally published in 1927), and Freemantleand Trungpa 1987. Relevant studies include Lauf 1977; Pommaret 1989; Blezer 1997; andLopez 1997, pp. 421-510. Lopez 1998, ch. 2, provides an interesting and thorough accountof the history of the reception of the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" in the West. He argues (p. 49),however, that \"the Tibetan text upon which it is based, the Bar do thos grol, would have beenfamiliar to scholars who knew the literature of the Nyingma sect; they would have recog-nized it as the name of a large genre of mortuary texts used by Nyingma lamas.\" This, how-ever, is misleading: the Tibetan title in question is preeminently associated with a particularbook \"discovered\" in the fourteenth century by Karma-gling-pa. Though it is indeed a Rnying-ma text, its transmission and employment were very widespread in the other sects as well,particularly among the Bka'-brgyud. Its unusually wide distribution made it something of acultural phenomenon, and this was well-recognized in traditional historiography, for instance,Dudjom Rinpoche 1991, vol. 1, p. 801.33. Kapstein 1980, 1992b, 1997b.34. Bar-do 'i gdams-pa.35. Thus, for instance, Evans-Wentz 1960, p. 183: \"perseverance in the reading of theGreat Bardo Thodol for forty-nine days is of the utmost importance.\" In China, the funeraryritual period of seven weeks was common to Taoism as well as Buddhism; see Schipper 1993,p. 75.36. The relevant doctrinal background is surveyed in Snellgrove 1987, vol. 1.37. Bar-do'i gdams-pa, plates 163-165.38. Of course, as recent ethnographical research in Tibetan and Himalayan communitiesconfirms, mortuary rites continue to be informed by many concerns and themes only tangen-tially related to normative Buddhist aspirations for the highest enlightenment. Issues such asthe fear of the deceased's return as a zombie or harmful ghost are only partially addressed by"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 10-12 207the attempt to guide the departed to liberation and so must sometimes be addressed by specialrituals.39. The period is in many respects a puzzling one for traditional historiography. An in-teresting attempt to assemble the available data may be found in Shel-dkar phreng-ba.40. Uebach 1987, pp. 120-153, supplies the text and a translation of one of the most thor-ough traditional accounts of the revival of Central Tibetan monasticism during the tenth cen-tury, that of Nel-pa Pandita.41. Zhe-chen chos-'byung, pp. 68-72, summarizes the traditional accounts of the survivalof these branches of learning in Khams.42. It will require greater progress than we have seen to date in the investigation of Ti-betan historical linguistics to clarify these matters adequately. Nevertheless, I think that myremarks accord with widespead impressions of the history of literary Tibetan. For instance,Miller 1976, p. 103, writes: \"Classical Tibetan [is] the language of the Tibetan translations ofthe Mahayana Buddhist canon as well as of other original texts, chiefly on religious, medical,historical, and grammatical subjects.... It was based upon Old Church Tibetan, which wasa variety of Old Tibetan and the language of earlier Buddhist texts. ...\"43. It seems absurd to hold that when the translation of Sanskrit was resumed by Rin-chen-bzang-po (958-1054), he had to reinvent the entire system of Sanskrit-Tibetan lexicog-raphy. We must assume, I think, that basic knowledge along these lines was available allalong. The earliest known version of Rin-chen-bzang-po's biography relates that he studiedSakyaprabha's Vinaya treatise, the Trisatakarika, and its commentary, in Tibetan as a teen-ager and at seventeen was inspired to take up translation after seeing an Indian book in thepossession of a pandita from Uddiyana (Snellgrove and Skorupski 1977-1980, vol. 2, p. 102).In their translation of this passage (p. 86) Snellgrove and Skorupski say that Rin-chen-bzang-po saw the book after \"receiving some small hospitality from the wife of a pandita who hadcome from Uddiyana,\" but I think it is perhaps better to read: \"a pandita who had come fromUddiyana received some small hospitality from [Rin-chen-bzang-po's] mother (yum), and,after eating, left behind a nice little Indian book.\"Another interesting datum from this period is PT 849, a manuscript first studied in Hackin1924, which dates, roughly, to 1000. It includes a small Sanskrit-Tibetan word list, with theSanskrit rendered according to a very rough phonetic system, rather than the standard equiva-lencies invented for exact transcription. Thus, one reads, for instance, 'bu-tha for buddha.Perhaps this is indicative of an interest in the basic Indian Buddhist vocabulary even amongTibetan Buddhists who had little or no specialized concern with translation, just as one findsin contemporary nonacademic writing on Buddhism a rudimentary knowledge of Sanskrit orPali vocabulary, though often in vulgar transcription.44. The evidence is reviewed by Samten Karmay (1981) and in Karmay's Btsan-po Dar-ma.Yamaguchi 1996 shows that a Madhyamaka treatise mentioned by Bu-ston may even be at-tributed to Dar-ma's authorship (under his actual regnal title, 'U'i-dum-btsan). Both Karmayand Yamaguchi also take note of PT 134, a dedicatory prayer in honor of this same king,found at Dunhuang. This, however, strikes me as an inconclusive element of the argument:with the change of kings the clergy may have been expected to perform dedications on behalfof the new monarch (\"the king is dead, long live the king!\"), even before knowing anythingof his actual policies.45. PT 849, lines 116-121.46. As the politics of funding for the arts and humanities in our own times demonstrate,it is by no means unusual to find fiscal austerity described, by those who must bear the bruntof it, as oppression of one sort or another.47. Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 610-612, supplies the traditional, much mythologized ac-count of Glang Dar-ma's decision not to persecute lay tantric adepts. In this case, however,the myth is certainly based on the indisputable evidence of continuous lay tantric activity during"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"208 Notes to Pages 12-13the period following the empire's decline. A good example is the early history of the 'Khonfamily, which in the eleventh century founded the Sa-skya-pa order: Sa-skya'i gdung-rabs,pp. 10-16.48. Stein 1988 makes a similar argument with respect to the Dunhuang documents thatare connected with Bon-po developments. The oft-held assumption that Tibetan writings foundat Dunhuang generally date to the period of the Tibetan occupation of the late eighth andearly ninth centuries is a bad one. As Takata 1994 shows, the Tibetan script was being usedat Dunhuang even to write Chinese as late as the tenth century.49. See, in particular, Davidson 1994; Karmay 1975a, 1980a, 1980b; Ruegg 1984; Snell-grove 1987, vol. 2, pp. 451-484.50. Hakeda 1972, p. 3: \"Kukai did not actually invent the kana syllabary, but its emer-gence owed much to his introduction of Sanskrit studies, for the kana system is formed onthe basis of the Sanskrit alphabet.\" Kukai himself, however, makes perfectly clear that hisown interest in Sanskrit is primarily related to the phonology of the mantras: \"The mantras,however, are mysterious and each word is profound in meaning. When they are transliteratedinto Chinese, the original meanings are modified and the long and short vowels confused. Inthe end we can get roughly similar sounds but not precisely the same ones. Unless we useSanskrit, it is hardly possible to differentiate the long and short sounds. The purpose of re-taining the source materials, indeed, lies here\" (p. 144).51. As Richardson 1998 [1990], p. 178, shows, Dpal-'khor-btsan, who reigned towardsthe beginning of the tenth century, constructed the temple of Bya-sa, which formerly houseda celebrated image of Vairocana. The great Sa-skya-pa master Bsod-nams-rtse-mo (1142-1182), writing in 1167 (Sa-skya bka'-'bum, vol. NGA, Chos-la 'jug-pa'i sgo, folios 53-55),provides a continuous account of calendrical calculation from the period of the empire downto his own time. The king just mentioned, Dpal-'khor-btsan, is again noted as having com-pleted his father's last rites in a wood female ox year, probably 905.52. See esp. Iwasaki 1993.53. Snellgrove 1967b, p. 20: \"The bon were just one class of priests among others, whosepractices and beliefs are covered by the general term of lha-chos, which may be translatedperhaps as 'sacred conventions'. The term BON, as referring to a whole set of religious prac-tices, would seem to have come into use at a later stage in deliberate opposition to the newuse of CHOS which now had the meaning of Sanskrit dharma limited specifically to the reli-gion of Sakyamuni. Thus there is probably no such thing as pre-Buddhist BON. . ..\" See alsoStein 1988. Kvserne 1995, introduction, provides a judicious survey of the varied senses ofthe term bon, and of contemporary Bon-po self-understanding in this regard.54. See, for example, Karmay 1975b; Kvaerne 1987; Martin 1994.55. An international project directed by Per Kvserne (Oslo) has compiled the materialsfor the first detailed catalogue of a version of the Bon-po Bka'- 'gyur, published in Sichuan.The publication of their results will be an important step in making this material accessible tocontemporary research. In addition to the Bka'-'gyur, an edition of the Bon-po Bstan-'gyurin over 300 volumes has now been published in Lhasa.56. These scriptures are among those studied in Rossi in press.57. Stein 1988.58. Much of the material to be discussed here has been used previously for comparativepurposes by Karmay 1988a, pp. 172-174, and, esp., Mimaki 1994. Compare also Snellgrove1987, vol. 2, p. 407.59. The notion of the yana is developed in so many Indian Buddhist sutras and sastrasthat it probably makes little sense to seek to identify too narrowly the likely sources of Ti-betan inspiration in this regard. One work, however, that certainly does merit particularlycareful scrutiny is the Lankavatara, which propounds a theory of five vehicles, that is explic-itly capable of indefinite expansion, in ch. 2, verses 201-202ab: devayanam brahmayanam"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 13-17 209srdvakiyam tathaiva ca/tdthdgatam ca pratyekam yanan etdn vaddmy aham//ydndndm nastivai nistha yavac cittam pravartate/ \"I speak of these vehicles: the vehicle of gods, the vehicleof Brahma, that of the Sravakas, of the Tathagatas, and of the Pratyekabuddhas. There is noend of vehicles, so long as mind extends.\" The Lankavatara was certainly well known toRnying-ma-pa authors for its teaching of the vehicles; see, e.g., Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 60-61, 80-81.60. PT 849, lines 14—16: theg pa rim pa dgu gang la bya zhe no//myi'i theg pa dang//lha'i theg pa dang/nyan thos kyi theg pa dang//rang sang rgyas kyi theg pa dang//mdosde 'i theg pa dang/ byang chub sems pa 'i theg pa dang//mdzo ga dang/ ky'ir ya dang/ u pa yadang/ de rnams ni theg pa rim pa dgu la bya. The text goes on to enumerate various subdivi-sions of the last three vehicles, of which Yoga is divided into the four branches of Yoga,Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga. It is not clear, however, that these have here the samesense that they do in the Rnying-ma-pa systems of nine vehicles.61. Karmay 1988a, ch. 6, provides the most thorough study of this text to date and dis-cusses its probable antiquity on pp. 142-144. He concludes that it must have been in exis-tence during the tenth century at the latest.62. Man-ngag Ita-phreng, pp. 2-6; Karmay 1988a, pp. 163-165 (text), 152-155 (translation).63. Theg-rim. The text was rediscovered as treasure (gter-ma) by the Ban-dhe mi-gsum(the \"three Buddhist monks\"), whose exact dates are not known, but who appear to have beenactive perhaps in the early eleventh century. It may, however, be in fact a somewhat laterwork. I am indebted to the great contemporary Bon-po master, Slob-dpon Bstan-'dzin Rnani-dag (Lopon Tenzin Namdak), for having first introduced me to it.64. This is Ston-pa Gshen-rab Mi-bo-che, revered by the Bon-po as the Buddha of ourworld age.65. Theg-rim, folios lb-3a. The names of the nine vehicles in Tibetan are: (1) lha mi gzhanbrten theg pa, (2) rang rtogs gshen rob theg pa, (3) thugs rje sems dpa'i theg pa, (4) g.yungdrung sems dpa'i theg pa, (5) bya ba gtsang spyod ye ban theg pa, (6) rnam pa kun Idanmngon shes theg pa, (7) dngos bskyed thugs rje rol ba'i theg pa, (8) shin tu don Idan kunrdzogs theg pa, (9) ye nas rdzogs chen yang rise bla med theg pa.66. It must be noted that there were several other Bon-po nine-vehicle systems, and thatthe one we have examined here, that of the \"Central Treasure\" (dbus-gter), which is attrib-uted to Vairocana, most closely corresponds to the Buddhist versions. Snellgrove 1967aprovides a detailed account of a rather different system, according to the \"Southern Trea-sure\" (Iho-gter), whose first four vehicles focus upon medicine, divination, and other mun-dane arts. In addition there is the system of the \"Northern Treasure\" (byang-gter), whichremains so far unstudied. For the classifications of these systems, see Bon-gyi bstan- 'byung,p. 142.67. The Sanskrit text may be found, for instance, in Sarvadarsanasamgraha, p. 2: yavajjlvet sukham jived nasti mrtyor agocarah/bhasmibhutasya dehasya punaragamanam kutah//68. Klein and Wangyal 1995 offers an excellent example.69. Blondeau 1971 demonstrates this. Kvaerne 1980 illustrates the complexity of the en-tire question of borrowings between Buddhists and Bon-po.70. The cuckoo's warble was an important metaphor in early works on Rdzogs-chen. SeeKarmay 1985, 1988a, pp. 41-59.71. Gal-mdo, pp. 192-193. The text cited here is said to be a treasure of Khu-tsha zla-'od(twelfth century), commenting upon an earlier text discovered by Gshen-chen klu-dga' (996-1035).72. The best example is Vasubandhu's Vyakhyayukti, which was available in Tibetantogether with the commentary of Gunamati by the early ninth century (Lalou 1953, nos. 649-650).

Samuel 1990 provides the theoretical background for Samuel'selaboration of the categories \"shamanic\" and \"clerical\" and helps to dispel some of the mis-understandings that may arise owing to the associations of the former term in particular.79. In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that in Kapstein 1992b I have also spo-ken of a Tibetan tantric seeker in India as one embarked upon a \"shamanic vision quest.\"Despite my present misgivings about the term in question, I still believe that my argumentthere was essentially correct, and I am not sure that there is another term available that woulddo the same work as \"shamanic\" in the context in which I chose to employ it.80. This is particularly true of the tendencies described in Lopez 1998, ch. 6.81. Among anthropologists who have considered relations between elite and nonelitereligious practice in Tibetan and Himalayan communities, one may refer to Ortner 1989;Mumford 1989; Samuel 1993.82. A good example is the popular opera Rgya-bza' bal-bza' (Chinese Bride, NepaleseBride), based on the legends of King Srong-btsan-sgam-po's court. The monastic sacred dances('cham) also often dramatized elements of the story of Tibet's adoption of Buddhism. His-torical lore was also widely transmitted in connection with pilgrimage. See Huber in Lopez1997, pp. 120-134; Kapstein 1997c, 1998. See now also Huber 1999.83. As Goldstein, in Goldstein and Kapstein 1998, p. 22, remarks: \"Tales abound inDrepung of famous scholar monks so poor that they had to eat the staple food—tsamba(parched barley flour)—with water rather than tea, or worse, who had to eat the leftover doughfrom ritual offerings (torma).\" This refers primarily to their early years of study; once estab-lished as teachers in their own right, noted monastic scholars often received sufficient sup-port from patrons to permit them to escape such abject poverty.84. Karma Chags-med (ca. 1600-1666), Gung-thang Bstan-pa'i sgron-me (1762-1823),Zhabs-dkar Tshogs-drug-rang-grol (1781-1850), and Rdza Dpal-sprul Rin-po-che (1808-1887) offer some of the best examples. Their lives and writings supply ample evidence ofsustained involvement in teaching to the laity.Chapter 21. Fletcher 1997, writing on the Christian conversion of pagan Europe, discusses the\"Christianization of time\" (pp. 255-258) and the effects of this upon medieval historians:\"Could a pagan past be permitted for the legatees of the western Roman empire? . .. For [Bede]the pre-Christian past of the English scarcely existed.... Isidore of Seville, whose Historyof the Goths was composed in about 620, preferred to provide them with a biblical ancestry.The Goths were descended from Magog son of Japheth son of Noah.\"2. Though I speak here of a Tibetan \"conversion,\" or \"adoption of Buddhism,\" it is im-portant to remember throughout that this was neither complete nor universal. For the earlyperiod with which we are concerned, in particular, we have little evidence that allows us todetermine just how successful Buddhism may or may not have been, outside of the specificroyal and monastic circles we know to have been actively involved in the promotion of thenew religion."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 23-24 2113. There is no consensus regarding the proper designation of the dynasty of the Btsan-po-s who ruled Tibet. Following Haarh 1969, some refer to the \"Yar-lung dynasty,\" a phrasederived from the name of the valley to the southeast of Lhasa, which was the region in whichthe Btsan-po-s had first established their rule. This usage, however, is unknown to Tibetansources. The early inscriptions and chronicles often designate the ruler as the Spu-rgyal(Beckwith 1987, pp. 8, 17), and sometimes this seems a dynastic title. To refer to Tibetduring the period of consolidation and expansion of the empire until its decline in the mid-ninth century, some scholars speak of \"imperial\" or \"dynastic\" Tibet. When referring tothis historical period here, \"early medieval Tibet,\" following Beckwith 1987, is preferredto the inaccurate \"ancient Tibet\" one finds in many popular books. Indeed, some even de-scribe fourteenth-century Tibet as \"ancient,\" for it is the allure of antiquity that engagesthe contemporary imagination when it comes to Tibet, and not at all the question of histori-cal periodization.4. As Tucci put it in his pioneering essay \"The Validity of the Tibetan Historical Tradi-tion\" (1947): \"we can accept as well founded the traditional account of Tibetan history ...without of course taking into consideration the legends and myths which later on were circu-lated and grew up concealing, as it were, the authentical kernel of the ancient chronicles\"(1971b, vol. 2, p. 462).5.

For an account of Aurel Stein's finds there in particular, seeStein 1933, ch. 12-14; Mirsky 1977, ch. 14. The India Office Library holdings of Tibetanmanuscripts brought to England by Stein are catalogued in IO Cat. and Yamaguchi 1977-1988. PT Cat. supplies an inventory of the Paris collections gathered by Pelliot. Selectionsfrom the Tibetan Dunhuang documents have been reproduced in CDTI and CDTII, whichinclude introductory essays with references to earlier studies of these texts. Many of thesesame documents are edited with notes in Tun-hong bod-yig shog-dril and Wang Yao and ChenJian, eds., Dunhuang Tubowen Shulun Wenji. Refer also to OTA, OTC, and OTG, and, con-cerning these same texts, Beckwith 1987.Bod-kyi rdo-ring, Richardson 1985, and Li and Coblin 1987 provide useful editions ofthe inscriptions dating to the period of the empire (though a number of previously unknowninscriptions have also appeared in recent years, to some of which reference will be made atappropriate points). Richardson's many studies of particular topics in early medieval Tibetanhistory are now gathered together in Richardson 1998, Pt. 1. For additional studies of par-ticular Dunhuang Tibetan documents, especially those by Imaeda, Lalou, Stein, and Uray,refer to the bibliography. For a recent bibliography of Dunhuang studies in Western languages,unfortunately limited to Sinological work and thus effacing the international character of theDunhuang finds, see Bussotti and Drege 1996.8. L. W. J. van der Kuijp, \"Tibetan Historiography,\" in Jackson and Cabezon 1995,pp. 39-56, offers a fine point of departure for the study of the formation of Tibetan traditionsof historical writing. Vostrikov 1970 remains a magisterial introduction to Tibetan historicalwriting, all the more remarkable for having been written in the 1930s, though it remained formany years unpublished following the author's untimely death at the age of thirty-three. Martin1997 now provides a very thorough bibliographical survey of the field of Tibetan historicalwriting. The \"historical myths of the early empire\" to which I refer are reviewed in chapter 8of the present volume.9.

Uray 1975, 1992.11. The Sba-bzhed is now known to us through two differing redactions of the text, eachincorporating readings from several manuscripts: Stein 1961 and Sba-bzhed. (The text pub-lished by Stein was reprinted in 1968 in a typeset edition at the Tibetan Educational PrintingPress in Dharmasala, India, incorporating some readings from a manuscript in the possessionof Burmiak Densapa of Gangtok, Sikkim. This edition, however, contains many misprints,which makes it difficult to identify precisely actual variant readings, and so will not be re-ferred to herein.) In addition, as the present book was nearing completion, a manuscript wasdiscovered in Tibet of a work entitled Dba'-bzhed, which is an older version of the same ora similar text, perhaps its very original. (Dba' here is the archaic spelling of the clan namethat later came to be rendered Sba.) While the discovery of the Dba'-bzhed does not causeme to substantially alter the conclusions for which I argue in this and the following two chap-ters, I have added to the end of this note a paragraph discussing its implications, so far as Ican adduce them in advance of the publication of the manuscript itself, and have added occa-sional brief remarks about the Dba'-bzhed as seems relevant elsewhere as well.Extensive quotations in the Mkhas-pa'i dga'-ston of Dpa'-bo Gtsug-lag-phreng-ba pro-vide considerable evidence of the Sba-bzhed in a version that was known to Tibetan scholarsof the sixteenth century; direct references, as well as obvious paraphrases and allusions, inthe writings of Nyang-ral Nyi-ma-'od-zer (1124-1196), Sa-skya Pandita Kun-dga'-rgyal-mtshan (1181-1251), and Bu-ston Rin-chen-grub (1290-1364), among many others, all con-tribute to the conclusion that, excepting perhaps for variant spellings and other like points ofdetail, the portions of the Sba-bzhed dealing with the confrontation between Chinese and IndianBuddhism in Tibet during the reign of Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan were, as early as the twelfthcentury, substantially similar to what we have today. Indeed, even in Nyang-ral's day, to judgefrom his paraphrases, which tend often to bring the text into accord with \"standard\" literaryTibetan, the Sba-bzhed must have seemed archaic and often difficult to understand. It comesas no great surprise, then, that Tibetan historical tradition frequently considers the author ofthe early sections of the Sba-bzhed to have been a direct witness to the late eighth-centuryand early ninth-century events narrated therein. And contemporary Tibetanists, while unwillingto affirm this without much qualification and expressing a degree of puzzlement about it, clearlyregard the Sba-bzhed as an authentically ancient source, or at least a direct derivative ofsuch sources. Despite the awareness of and interest in the Sba-bzhed on the part of leadingTibetanists, however, questions regarding its origins and the precise nature of its contribu-tion to our understanding of eighth- and ninth-century Tibetan history and to the later for-mation of Tibetan religious historiography remain mostly unresolved.The Sba-bzhed first became available to contemporary scholarship through manuscriptcopies that were independently collected in Lhasa during the 1940s by Hugh Richardson andGiuseppe Tucci. A collation of these manuscripts—both of which represent the so-called \"Sba-bzhed with supplement\" (Sba-bzhed zhabs-btags-ma)—was prepared and published in 1961by Rolf Stein. In his introduction, Stein notes that this version with supplement had beenestimated by Richardson to date to the fourteenth century, and by Roerich to the twelfth orthirteenth. Yoshiro Imaeda (1975) lent his support to Richardson's estimate, while Stein him-self characteristically withheld judgement about this.That the supplemented version could not be assigned to a period prior to the twelfth cen-tury, or the last decades of the eleventh at the very earliest, was established by the supple-ment itself, which concerns events following the fall of the imperial dynasty during themid-ninth century, continuing down to AtiSa's mission in Tibet in the mid-eleventh. The four-teenth-century date assigned to the supplemented Sba-bzhed by Richardson and Imaeda issupported by a single reference within it (Stein 1961, p. 54) to the 1322 history by Bu-ston"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Notes to Page 25 213(Gsung-rab rin-po-che'i bang mdzod = Bu-ston chos-'byung, translated in Obermiller 1931-1932). The sentence in which this occurs, however, may not be an integral part of the text; if,as I suspect is the case, this is really a reader's annotation (mchan-bu) that has been copied bya later scribe as if integral, then the major objection to Roerich's estimate is answered.However this may be, it was also clear that the supplemented Sba-bzhed was based at leastin part on uncontestably ancient sources. One example that demonstrates its antiquity is dis-cussed in chapter 5, namely, the highly interesting references found within the Sba-bzhed tothe Korean Chan master Kim Hwasang (Ch. Jin Heshang), also known as Wuxiang. None ofthis would likely have been familiar to later Tibetan historians were it not for the testimonyof the Sba-bzhed, the author of which, accordingly, must be thought to have at least had ac-cess to some very old documents.The 1980 edition of the Nationalities Publishing House in Beijing differs in certain re-spects from the Richardson-Stein text, though in its general outlines it is closely similar tothe first sixty-five pages of that edition, that is to say, to the section that the colophon of theRichardson-Stein edition specifies to be the \"real original\" (rang-gi ngo-bo) of the text (Stein1961, p. 92). The colophon of the Beijing edition (which is not found in the Richardson-Steintext) closes with the comment (Sba-bzhed, p. 82) that the text was prepared by a scribe calledSnyas-kyi btsun-pa Ldum-bu Ma-ni Arga Sidhi. I assume that \"Arga\" is a transcription ortypographical error for \"Artha,\" in which case the scribe's proper name should be: Ldum-buNor-bu-don-grub, the venerable monk (btsun-pa = Skt. bhadantd) of Snyas. Now, this is veryinteresting, because this name is suspiciously similar to that of Ldum-bu Don-grub-dbang-rgyal, considered to have been \"the greatest scholar in astrology, astronomy and calendricalcalculations to appear in Tibet during the 17th century\" and one of the Fifth Dalai Lama'sinner circle (Smith 1970, p 18, n. 36). If this supposition proves to be correct, then, becausethe Great Fifth's intense interest in the Sba-bzhed is well known, we might surmise that theBeijing edition in fact represents a version of the text, if not the version of the text, preparedfor or at least available to the Fifth Dalai Lama himself. In other words, it is possible that theBeijing edition represents what was thought to be the most authentic version of the Sba-bzhedstill to be found during the seventeenth century. Because the Mkhas-pa'i dga'-ston of Dpa'-boGtsug-lag-phreng-ba, a scholar well known for his antiquarian interests and access to genu-inely old documents, seems also to suggest that he regarded as authoritative a version of thetext closely similar to this one, we must further entertain the possibility that the Beijing edi-tion represents a relatively early redaction of the Sba-bzhed indeed. But even if we now ac-cept the age of Nyang-ral in the twelfth century as an approximate terminus ad quern, thequestion remains: just how old is it?Ruegg 1989 has commented on the probable antiquity of the Sba-bzhed in the light of theBeijing edition. His primary concern there is the confrontation between Chinese and IndianBuddhism in Tibet that the Sba-bzhed describes, and he writes:In sum, despite the fact that the Supplemented Version of the sBa bzed published byStein must for the reasons mentioned above be considered as a whole to be muchlater than the eighth century, and although the recensions of the sBa bzed now avail-able to us differ in wording and in many details, there would nevertheless seem toexist no compelling reason to reject as completely spurious and unreliable the matteron which the recensions agree in substance. And there is reason to think that boththese recensions contain ancient records or traditions (bzed lugs) that could go backto members of the sBa family which played so important a role at the time of thefoundation of bSam yas and the controversy between the \"Gradualists\" and \"Simul-taneists\" in late eighth-century Tibet, and that we thus have reflected (however indi-rectly) in our texts of the sBa bzed the views of major participants in these events.(Ruegg 1989, p. 71)"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"214 Notes to Page 25Though Ruegg's assessment seems generally reasonable, his argument is in one impor-tant respect flawed: as will be made clear later in this chapter, we can demonstrate instancesin which the two versions of the Sba-bzhed are in perfect agreement about matters concern-ing which they can both be shown to be false. Their mere convergence, therefore, providesno sure ground for judgements of probable veracity. The reason for this is not hard to adduce:if, as seems most likely, the expanded redaction represented by the Richardson-Stein text hadin its ancestry a text closely resembling the Beijing edition, then their agreements, as well asthe evidential weakness of some of these agreements, are adequately explained.One additional, curious bit of evidence has been brought to the attention of Tibetanists byEimer 1991: an eleventh- or early twelfth-century work of the Bka'-gdams-pa tradition, theBe'u-bum sngon-po of Dge-bshes Dol-pa (1059-1131), a disciple of Po-to-ba (1027-1105),with its commentary by Lha-'bri-sgang-pa (early twelfth century), offers a brief account ofthe Bsam-yas debate, in terms that mostly match those of the Sba-bzhed verbatim, an abridge-ment (if, indeed, abridgement is what is involved here) that usually avoids archaic turns ofphrase. Moreover, the Be 'u-bum sngon-po specifies that Po-to-ba himself learned of the de-bate from one Jo-bo Se-btsun, a rather obscure figure from eastern Tibet (Khams) who, how-ever, is also known to have been an early teacher of Atisa's most renowned Tibetan disciple,the great 'Brom-ston Rgyal-ba'i 'byung-gnas (1004-1064). The information we derive fromthis source explicitly confirms that there was indeed some sort of ongoing transmission of asystem of \"sudden enlightenment meditation\" that was described as just that, continuing atleast into the early part of the eleventh century, a circumstance that lends some plausibility tothe contention of Sa-skya Pandita and others that Chinese sudden meditation techniques be-came mixed up with the teachings of the eleventh- and twelfth-century Tibetan meditationschools. (On this, see ch. 5.) And Se-btsun's own preference for the Kamalaslla tradition ofgradualism, articulated in a manner that so closely corresponds to what we find in the Sba-bzhed, does much to strengthen the supposition that some version of the Sba-bzhed\" s. accountwas already in circulation before Atisa arrived in Tibet in 1042, whether or not it was knownby that title.The recent discovery in Lhasa of an old manuscript of a work called the Dba'-bzhed nowsuggests that the suppositions just outlined are largely correct. The manuscript, which is theobject of a collaborative research project involving the Tibet Academy of Social Science (Lhasa)and the Austrian Academy of Science (Vienna), has been described in reports by Pa-sangs-dbang-'dus (Lhasa) and Hildegard Diemberger (Vienna) to the International Association ofTibetan Studies during its 1998 seminar at Bloomington, Indiana. I am further grateful to Pa-sangs-dbang-'dus for informative conversations about this manuscript during my visit to Lhasain August 1998. The Dba'-bzhed, on which we now see the publication referred to in n. 15below, confirming the hypotheses offered in this book, does not include the episode discussedin the present chapter and does have a version of the story analyzed in chapter 3. In its descrip-tion of the confrontation between Chan and Indian Buddhism, it accords more closely with theChinese account studied in Demieville 1952, and this perhaps confirms the argument given laterin this chapter, that the text is the work of an author (or authors) largely sympathetic to the ac-tivities of Chinese Buddhists in eighth-century Tibet.12.

Gnyags Jnanakumara is a figure celebrated inlater Rnying-ma-pa tradition as a great master of the rites of Vajraklla, and above all of thewrathful powers of sorcery derived from those rites (Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 601-605).18. On Buddhagupta see ch. 4, nn. 68-72.19. OTC, lines 354 and 358, does use the phrase chos-bzang in a song attributed to KhriLde-gtsug-btsan and his court, but this appears to mean \"fine customs\" in this context, andnot \"excellent dharma.\" The early ninth-century inscription at Skar-chung, however, doesascribe the construction of some temples, including one at Mchims-phu (Mching-phu), to him(Richardson 1985, pp. 74-75, lines 10-12).20. Ljang is commonly used to designate the kingdom of Nanzhao, in modern Yunnan,which was subjugated by the Tibetans in 703, according to OTA. So it is plausible to hold,concurring with Backus 1981 and Beckwith 1983, that Queen Khri-btsun was from Nanzhao.Stein 1983, p. 216, however, shows that Ljang may sometimes have other significations inOld Tibetan, so that its exact reference here is somewhat uncertain. Backus, pp. 44-45, mis-reads Thomas 1951, p. 107, in asserting that there is inscriptional evidence concerning Ljang-tsha Lha-dbon. For more on Nanzhao in relation to early Tibet, see Ecsedy 1984.21. This is a relatively early reference to this well-known myth, which is already welldeveloped in the eleventh or twelfth century (Bka'-chems, pp. 48-57).22. This also seems to be an early mention of a popular myth, on the evolution of whichsee ch. 4 and 8, and Stein 1986a.23. The \"names\" of the Chinese princesses who were sent to Tibet—Wencheng Gongzhuand Jincheng Gongzhu—are of course not proper names at all, but the formal titles connectedwith their appanages.24. The practice of sorcery by mantra-adepts becomes a major theme in Tibetan tantricliterature from the eleventh century onwards. This perhaps also points to the period in whichthe Sba-bzhed was redacted on the basis of earlier materials.25. Richardson 1998 [1997], pp. 207-215, \"Two Chinese Princesses in Tibet,\" providesa useful summary of evidence concerning the Wencheng Gongzhu (Tib. Mun-sheng Kong-co) and the Jincheng Gongzhu (Tib. Kim-sheng Kong-co).26. Tshe in this case is evidently not the familiar Tibetan word meaning \"life\" or \"lon-gevity\" but probably transcribes the Chinese zhai, \"a fast of abstinence.\" See ch. 3.27. Brag-dmar included the north bank of the Gtsang-po in and around the region in whichBsam-yas was founded (Chan 1994, p. 628ff).28.

Thismuch should suffice to indicate the very wide distribution of the story, and the extent to whichit was traditionally accepted as true.30. Compare, however, Bu-ston's account (Obermiller 1932, p. 186), where the abduc-tion takes place but not the recovery of the child, so that Khri Srong-lde-btsan is in fact broughtup as a Sna-nam-pa on his mother's side."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"216 Notes to Pages 28-3031.

Thus Bu-ston' s account (see n. 30, above) is an attempt to reconcile conflicting sources.38. Yamaguchi 1996.39. Beckwith 1983.40. Beckwith 1983, in fact, concurs with this second point, but, as will be seen in thefollowing note, we differ in some respects in our interpretations of its implications.41. Beckwith 1983 is not primarily concerned with our present conundrum, so it will notbe necessary for our purposes here to survey all the many issues that are at stake, but, to-gether with some additional background, it will be useful at the least to be familiar with hismajor conclusions.According to OTA, King Khri 'Dus-srong died in 704, and in 705 his eldest son, LhaBal-pho, was deposed, apparently by the late monarch's mother, the dowager empress KhriMa-lod, who established the younger son, the year-old infant Rgyal Rtsug-ru, as monarch.(On Khri Ma-lod, see now Uebach 1997, pp. 55-56.) In 712, Khri Ma-lod dies and the eight-year-old monarch assumes the title by which he would henceforth be officially known, KhriLde-gtsug-rtsan. The Jiu Tangshu notes that the request for a Chinese princess to marry theTibetan monarch was first issued in 702/703, that is, prior to the birth of Rgyal Gtsug-ru in704, and was followed by a repeated request from the Tibetan empress, the monarch's grand-mother, in 705. Both the OTA and the Tangshu place the arrival of the Jincheng Gongzhu inTibet in 710. It would, of course, be a great pity if the six-year-old monarch had at that timealready become a \"Bearded Ancestor\" (but, as his brother's fate makes clear, life at the top canbe hard!). Now, Beckwith supposes that the monarch's deposed elder brother, Lha Bal-pho, isnone other than the Ljang-tsha Lha-dbon of the later histories, and that this person is furtherto be identified with the Sras Lhas-bon who dies in 739, the same death year as that of theChinese princess, and whose last rites are recorded together with hers as falling in 741.Beckwith suggests further that the princess may have really been married to this person, forwhom, clearly, she was first intended, and that her marriage to the king Khri Lde-gtsug-btsanwas a fiction. Beckwith argues that the empress Khri Ma-lod's deposition of the rightfulmonarch may have amounted to a palace coup that created a real crisis of legitimation for thechild she placed on the throne, and by extension for his successors. (In any event, there seemscertainly to have been some sort of ministerial rebellion in 704.) This would help to explain,he argues, why some of the ministers, in 755, revived the ancient custom of murdering theold, and in this case possibly illegitimate, king, intending Khri Lde-gtsug-btsan to be suc-ceeded by his thirteen-year-old son, Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan. The assassination is asserted bythe Stag-sgra Klu-khong inscription in Lhasa (Richardson 1985, pp. 6-7, lines 5-10) andindirectly supported by the continuation of OTA (BM 8212), as well as by later histories thatreport the banishment of the ministers named as the assassins in that inscription. (The laterhistories usually have the king die in a riding accident.) Beckwith reasons that the problem oflegitimation was not dispelled by the old king's blood, however: his son's promotion of auniversal religion, construction of the Bsam-yas monastery with what Beckwith terms its\"kosmokrator symbolism,\" and the later attribution to him of maternal descent from the Chi-nese imperial line may all be seen as part of an effort to restore the dynasty's shaken credibil-"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Notes to Page 30 217ity. It should be noted that Beckwith takes great care to emphasize that he offers this as hy-pothesis only, an effort to make sense of a deeply perplexing record.While the evidence is not so decisive as to enable us to assess Beckwith's suppositionswith any assurance, some points, it seems to me, require extreme caution. Not long afterBeckwith's article was published, two related, previously unknown histories made their ap-pearance in Lhasa: Mkhas-pa Lde'u and Lde'u Jo-sras. These were attributed by the editorsof Mkhas-pa Lde 'u to a pair of relatively obscure twelfth- and early thirteenth-century Bud-dhist teachers affiliated with the Rnying-ma-pa and Bka'-gdams-pa traditions. (On the ques-tion of authorship and provenance see Kuijp 1992.) These works seem often to make use ofgenuinely ancient and now otherwise unavailable sources, and this accords well with the as-sumption that their provenance is one of the southern Tibetan districts of Lho-kha, neighbor-ing Lho-brag, or an immediately adjacent region (oral tradition sometimes attributes them toSpo-bo), for there is much evidence that authentic documents of the imperial period survivedfor centuries in just these places. See now, for instance, Huang 1989.With regard to KM Lde-gtsug-btsan and his succession, the two histories just mentioned,though very obscure in places, offer several interesting indications. Of course, I am not sug-gesting that these be accepted outright, only that, in the light of these works, alternative inter-pretations of the evidence may be put forward. In the first place, Lde'u Jo-sras, pp. 120-121,states that Khri Lde-gtsug-btsan had an elder brother Pa-tshab-tsha Lha Bal-po, a younger brotherLod Ma-lod, and a son Ljang-tsha Lha-dbon, who died before his Chinese bride arrived in Tibet.The \"younger brother Lod Ma-lod\" is almost certainly a badly mangled record of the name ofthe grandmother Khri Ma-lod, the dowager empress. Lha Bal-po and Lha-dbon are here ex-plicitly not the same man, and, what is more, the likelihood of their identity is diminished bythe assertion that their maternal lines were altogether different: the former was born to a motherof the Central Tibetan Pa-tshab clan, while the latter, as Beckwith has emphasized, may havebeen born to the Tibetan king's Nanzhao bride, for 'Jang/Ljang is the old Tibetan designationof Nanzhao, though it was not exclusively so used. (See n. 20 in this chapter. Nanzhao, accord-ing to OTA, was defeated by the Tibetans in 703 and fell intermittently under Tibetan swaythroughout the eighth century, so that marriages between the royal families may well have takenplace.) Given the apparent distortion of the dowager empress's name, however, we must bevery cautious about assigning too much weight to the testimony of this passage.Nevertheless, there is one additional piece of evidence from the OTA themselves, which,given the account of Lde 'u Jo-sras, probably should be weighed more heavily than Beckwithhas allowed: the mention of the monarch's deposed brother in 705 calls him Btsan-po gcenLha Bal-pho, \"the monarch's elder brother, Lha Bal-pho,\" whereas the figure whose death in739 and funeral in 741 are mentioned together with those of the Chinese princess is referredto as Btsan-po sras Lhas-bon, \"the monarch's son, Lhas-bon.\" Certainly Lhas-bon is equiva-lent to the classical Lha-dbon, the name meaning literally \"divine or royal heir-nephew,\" whichthe Sba-bzhed takes to refer to the prince's godlike good looks. It seems possible that theChinese princess, whom other sources specify to have been a victim of plague, died close tothe birth of the unnamed heir she bore, who was taken by the same illness. However this mayhave been, it seems certain that OTA cannot not be naming one individual as both the brotherand son of the present monarch, i.e., Khri Lde-gtsug-btsan; and, though it is not impossible,it seems very improbable that, in identifying a single individual, \"Btsan-po\" should refer to\"the present monarch,\" Khri Lde-gtsug-btsan, in 705 but to \"the previous monarch,\" KhriLde-gtsug-btsan's father, Khri 'Dus-srong, in 741.The plot, however, grows thicker still: Mkhas-pa Lde'u, p. 300, while not mentioning KhriLde-gtsug-btsan's brother at all, has something curious to say about his first son, Ljang-tshaLha-dbon. It tells us that the Chinese princess was invited to be his bride, that the omens weregood, but that when she arrived in Tibet those prognostications were defeated because theprince had become demented, for which reason she married the old king instead."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"218 Notes to Pages 30-31Now, I have two hypotheses to offer in connection with all this, and following Beckwith'slead, I must emphasize once more that these are only hypotheses; the evidence simply doesnot permit one to draw very strong conclusions:(1) The deposition of Khri Lde-gtsug-btsan's elder brother in 705 remains still very much amystery. We really have no certain evidence establishing there to have been a palace coup,though we have no way of ruling this out as a possibility either, especially given the evidencewe do possess of a ministerial rebellion. Now, let us suppose that the mention of princelydementia applies, not to Ljang-tsha Lha-dbon, but to the deposed Lha Bal-pho. If somethinglike that were the case, we can well imagine that an alteration of the order of royal successionwould have been perceived as necessary, without at the same time devastating the dynasty'sclaim of legitimacy. Indeed, given the normal violence of dynastic succession in imperial (andeven in postimperial!) Tibet, a phenomenon to which the author of Mkhas-pa Lde'u evendevotes a special section of his book (pp. 375-376), it is difficult to see why Beckwith re-gards the events of 705, whatever they may have been, to have created in this instance a spe-cial legitimation crisis extending even to the following generation.(2) If the Chinese princess were indeed the mother of an heir apparent who died at or nearbirth together with his mother, and if the Chinese princess had been, as tradition maintains,a much admired figure among certain later circles in Tibet, then the Sna-nam queen, whowas Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan's real mother according to OTG, may have come to be regardedmetaphorically as the thief of the rightful crown prince, and the dead prince may have thenbeen attributed in legend to the otherwise unknown Nanzhao queen. It is, moreover, mostprobable that there was considerable confusion about Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan's maternalline even at a relatively early date, for the OTA, line 241, informs us that his mother, Mang-mo-rje—this being specified in OTG as a name of the Sna-nam queen—died, not in child-birth, but before a year was out.Thus, we see that an alternative construction of the record is available to us. The crucialpoint is this: in the light of what has been said so far, it becomes very difficult to imagine—even if Beckwith were in large measure correct—that the attribution of birth to a Chineseprincess would have importantly contributed to the conception of Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan'slegitimate kingship. Why, for instance, did the Dunhuang annalist, who has no apparent res-ervations over the issue of legitimacy, and who, as Uray has cogently argued, almost cer-tainly reflects the official historical record of the old Tibetan state, preserve the opposingaccount? Why would later Buddhist historians have then grown so uncomfortable over thequestion of legitimacy that they felt the need to relate the king to the Chinese royal line, cen-turies after the fact?42. I do not take account here of the long appendix added sometime after the eleventhcentury to the Zhabs-btags-ma version of the text (see Stein 1961, p. 65, line 15, throughp. 92).43. See ch. 5.44.

Here are a few of the points at which karma and rebirth are emphasized:When the Jincheng Gongzhu finds that her original bridegroom, prince Ljang-tsha Lha-"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"220 Notes to Page 34dbon, has died, she concludes that it is because \"his karma did not accord with my own\" (Sba-bzhed, p. 3). Afterwards, she institutes last rites (tshe/zhai) for the departed ministers, movedby compassion for their fate after death.When the four-year-old Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan is playing in a pond with his pals, theyhear that the father of one of them is said to have committed a great sin by killing some pi-geons. The children begin to debate whether they would also become sinners were they toharm the bugs and worms in the sand beneath their feet. One of the playmates, a Chinese boywho seems to be none other than the young Sba Shan-shi, invokes a Chinese scripture calledHur (< Ch./o < Skt. buddha), which teaches the doctrine of moral virtue, kusalakarma. It isthe little prince's delight about this that arouses ministerial suspicions that he will come tofavor the Dharma (Sba-bzhed, p. 5.)Later, when Kim Hwasang relates to Sba Shan-shi his prophecy of Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan'seventual conversion (pp. 7-8), he transmits to him three volumes that will promote the king'sfaith; the first among them, as it turns out, again concerns the teaching of the ten virtues (Sba-bzhed, p. 15).Before the king attains his majority, however, and following the decease of Khri Lde-gtsug-btsan, a clique among the ministers succeeds in suppressing Buddhism and banning thefunerary rites instituted by the Chinese princess. It is at this time that the episode to be exam-ined in detail in chapter 3 occurs (Sba-bzhed, p. 10).Sba Gsal-snang travels to Nepal to meet Santaraksita, setting the stage for the latter'seventual mission to Tibet. On their first meeting, the Indian master discloses that their con-nection was one formed over many lifetimes (Sba-bzhed, p. 12).One might go on at far greater length in this vein, but this much should be sufficient tosuggest that the Sba-bzhed is well aware that karma and rebirth had been in some respectcontested notions, and that it seeks not only to report this controversy, but to take a stand-point of active advocacy with respect to it. And to this we must add that the intense opposi-tion to the teaching of Heshang Moheyan and his followers that it attributes to Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan appears to stem primarily from the conviction that such teaching threatens toundermine the well-ordered \"kammatic\" universe.66. See ch. 3, pp. 42-46.67. The early Dba'-bzhed text, described by Hildegard Diemberger in her presentationto the July 1998 seminar of the International Association for Tibetan Studies, at Bloomington(n. 11 above), includes an account of a debate, following the death of Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan, between ministers favoring Bon-po last rites and those supporting Buddhism. Thoughnot found in the Sba-bzhed, this comports very well with my emphasis here on the roleof controversy about cosmology, for Buddhist cosmology represents in this context theideological dimension of the practical problem of how best to address the fate of thedead.68. See n. 22.69. Sba-bzhed, p. 4; Stein 1961, p. 4.70. This becomes an important motif in the later legends of the great stupa of Bodh Nath,Nepal, in particular. See Blondeau 1994.71.

Dbon-zhang rdo-ring offers a de-tailed reading of the inscription in its historical context.76. East Inscription, lines 29-30: bar 'ga' phan tshun gy'i so 'i blon pos gnodpa dag rngulgyis kyang. (On the verb rngul, see Richardson 1985, p. 115, n. 5.)77. It is of interest to speculate that the uncle-nephew relationship may have had verydifferent cultural connotations in Tibet and China, and that this, unfortunately, has con-tributed to the long history of Sino-Tibetan misunderstanding. Chinese sources seem clearlyto regard the relationship as implying Tibet's status as a tributary state, the junior partyenjoying the protection of the avuncular Chinese empire. In Tibet, however, where the Btsan-pohad traditionally required the support of the leading aristocratic clans to maintain his rule,the relationship perhaps involved another symbolic code: the heads of the clans that hadentered into marital relations with the Btsan-po became his fathers-in-law, \"uncles\" bymarriage, and this was reflected in the title \"uncle minister\" (zhang-blon). In other words,a familial designation of seniority was in effect exchanged for a subsidiary political posi-tion; real power was alienated for a gain in symbolic prestige. Thus, there is nothing in the822 treaty inscription to suggest that by referring to himself as the \"nephew\" of the Chi-nese emperor, Khri Lde-gtsug-btsan considered himself to be a political inferior. From theChinese perspective, the Tibetans were a subsidiary power, but from the Tibetan perspec-tive, the familial relationship may have implied the Chinese acceptance of their lack of realpolitical authority in Tibet.78.

One point that seems clear, and of consid-erable interest in connection with our present text, is that bon seems often to be used in con-nection with funeral rites and the specialized officiants who performed such rites, as is thecase in the important manuscript first studied in Lalou 1952.5. Schopen 1997, esp. ch. 6-8, demonstrates the steps whereby, in Indian monastic Bud-dhism, sarira, \"the body,\" came to mean \"relics.\" In our present text the Sanskrit term itselfis transcribed and the Tibetan translation term, ring-bsrel, is not used.6. In the episode itself, the gender of the reborn daughter is unclear, but near its end, theSba-bzhed, p. 78, speaks of a daughter of Sba Gsal-snang named Spyan-ras-gzigs (= Skt.Avalokitesvara), who may be the same person. That the daughter was named for Avalo-kitesvara, who as Guanyin in China became a female bodhisattva, is of great interest in thelight of her birth's connection with a Chinese Buddhist monk.

Afterwards, when he was again abroad in the evening, he sawthe snake holding a brilliant pearl in its mouth, and as he approached it, the snake is said to haveaddressed him thus: 'I am the son of His Majesty the Dragon, and while recreating myself waswounded; to you, Sir, I am indebted for the preservation of my life, and have brought this pearlto recompense you for your kindness.' The Minister accepted the pearl and presented it to hisSovereign, who placed it in his hall, where by its influence the night became as day.\" And onp. 320, Williams notes: \"The offspring of aged parents is compared to a pearl produced by anold oyster.\" See also Schipper 1993, p. 21, on the pearl that adorns the roof of Taoist temples.14. Lamasse 1984 (originally published in 1920), where the source is Xin guo wen, origi-nally published by the Commercial Press of Shanghai, c. 1904. The same story is given inBrandt 1954 (originally published during the 1920s), pp. 50-54.15. Here and in the following paragraph, my comments on the composition of Chinesecharacters are indifferent with respect to their actual etymologies, Chinese etymology beinga field entirely beyond my competence. Popular or folkloric etymologies are all that are atstake in the present context, for I am concerned only with associations, not the true histories,of words.16. Laufer 1912, pp. 294-305, \"Jade Amulets of the Dead.\" However, Eberhard 1986,p. 230, asserts that \"[i]n ancient times, a pearl was laid in the mouth of a dead person,\" and hefurther connects this with its symbolic associations with fertility. Groot 1892, pp. 269-279,discusses \"Placing Precious Objects in the Mouth of the Dead\" in some detail and writes (277):\"During the Han dynasty pearls also occupied a place among the objects which were intro-duced in to the mouth of the dead.... The same reasons why gold and jade were used forstuffing the mouth of the dead hold good for the use of pearls in this connection; indeed, thelatter are also very frequently alluded to in Chinese literature as depositories of Yang matter,and as such ranked amongst the bearers of vitality. . . . [Medical works] say that pearls can beuseful for recalling to life those who have expired or are at the point of dying.\" See, further,Schafer 1963, pp. 242-245 (\"pearls\"), and 237-239 (\"fire orbs\").17. This is clear, for instance, in its fanciful explanations for the terms brtse-min-pa andston-min-pa, reading them as if they were Tibetan words (Sba-bzhed, p. 64; Stein 1961,"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 41-43 223p. 54). The former, a transcription of the Chinese for \"gradual entrance sect\" (jianmenpai), isexplained there to refer to \"one who is loveless,\" while the latter, meaning \"sudden entrancesect\" (dunmenpai), is taken to refer to \"one who is not a teacher,\" with suitable anecdotespresented to account for these odd ways of denoting the two factions. As Tibetan writers seemusually to be well aware that these are in fact Chinese words and aware too of their actualsignificance (for instance, Bu-ston, in Obermiller 1932, p. 196), we must assume, I think,that the redactor of the Sba-bzhed was enjoying some coarse wordplay here.18.

Biraben and Le Goff 1969, p. 1497, confirm a series of outbreaks in the lands ofthe eastern Mediterranean during the 740s, so it is possible this was part of the same plaguecycle that killed the princess of Jincheng. They describe the plague in question as \"une vraiepeste & bubons bien decrite,\" citing J. D. Tholozan, Histoire de la peste bubonique enMesopotamie (Paris, 1874). Herlihy 1997, ch. 1, however, demonstrates that historicalreports of buboes as a plague symptom do not alone permit a precise epidemiologicalidentification of the disease in question in any given case. For a broad interpretation of thehistorical significance of plague cycles, see McNeill 1977, and ch. 3, in particular, for lateantiquity and the early medieval period.Commenting on the relationship between the 739 outbreak of plague in Tibet and the per-secution of Buddhism, Beckwith 1983, p. 7, writes: \"The foreign monks were blamed—nodoubt justly—for having brought the plague with them. . . .\" Assuming that the plague didspread from Inner Asia, however, and given Tibet's very extensive military and administra-tive presence in Inner Asia during this period, as is well documented in Beckwith 1987, itseems not warranted to conclude that the spread of Buddhism was specially linked to the spreadof the disease. Military convoys were no less likely to have been accompanied by rats andfleas. What seems certain is that the presence of plague aroused fear of the alien, and that thissentiment, rather than precise knowledge of the illness's sources, provoked the anti-Buddhistreaction.29.

Beckwith 1990 attributes this threefold structure to Sa-skya Pandita (1182-1251),though he rightly notes that there were Indian antecedents. The recent publication of the Dbu-masar-gsum of Phya-pa Chos-kyi-seng-ge (1109-1169) makes clear that the elements of thismode of analysis were well-established in Tibet before Sa-skya Pandita's time, though with-out employing the latter's strict threefold outline.38. Blondeau 1997, p. 213: \"Pour dire 1'essentiel, un individu est la reincarnation d'uneSme issue d'un «stock» d'ames, et son humanisation resulte de la jonction harmonieusede cette Sme avec la «force de vie»....\"39. Steinkellner 1988, treating a Dunhuang Buddhist scholastic text that offers a proof ofthe teaching of rebirth, suggests that such an argument was being promulgated in monasticcircles, at least.40. The relevant manuscripts are PT 37, 126, 640, 992, and 1284; and IO 285 and vol.70, fol. 49.41. These are explained in detail in Shes-bya kun-khyab, vol. 3, pp. 87-109. The fourreversals are: to turn the mind from the interests of this life to that of future lives (tshe 'di-lasbio ldog-pa)', to turn the mind from interest in samsara to freedom therefrom ('khor-ba-las bioldog-pa); to turn the mind from the peace of individual nirvana to the universal aspiration of theMahayana (zhi-bde-las bio ldog-pa)', and to turn the mind from dualistic apprehensions of sub-ject and object (gzung-'dzin-las bio ldog-pa). Following works of popular instruction such asDwags-po thar-rgyan and Kun-bzang bla-ma, however, the four are often thought to be theparticular study topics of: the precious human birth (dal-'byor rnyed-dka'); death and imper-manence ('chi-ba mi-nag-pa); the defects of samsara ('khor-ba'i nyes-dmigs); and karmic cau-sation (las rgyu-'bras). In the earlier Bka'-gdams-pa sources, followed by Kong-sprul in Shes-bya kun-khyab, these topics are included in the first two \"reversals of attitude.\"42. PT 239, described in chapter 1. Stein 1970 has analyzed its polemical passages.43. Steinkellner 1988.44. This is especially evident in PT 16-IO 751, reproduced in CDT I, plates 7-16, the IOportion of which was first studied in Thomas 1951, pp. 92-109. Note, for example, the fol-lowing in Thomas's translation (p. 102, and p. 96 for the text): \"[M]ay the purpose in themind of the prince Khri Gtsug-lde-brtsan have been accomplished; and the harm done to theenemy by the Great Councillor Uncle Khri-sum-rje and Great Uncle Lha-bzan through greatdefeats of the hostile Chinese and Drug and other means great and small, and on the part ofcertain of the city of Mkhar-tsan, who, taking sides with the stubborn heroic people of Tibetand being foremost of heroes in winning two great victories in a single year, on behalf of theventure for dominion on the part of the lord and people of Tibet went forward with a will toharm animate creatures, so that wounds were needs afflicted, may those wounds likewise behealed so that not a scar remains!\"45.

Thus, in a similar vein, Kantorowicz 1957, p. 121, cites Accursius,writing in the thirteenth century: \"Just as the priests minister and confection things holy, sodo we, since the laws are most sacred.. .. And just as the priest, when imposing penitence,renders to each one what is his right, so do we when we judge.\"53. It remains a question whether or not he is to be identified with the Dharmaghosasanti ofZa'ur praised by the Btsan-po as his guru in the introduction to the Bka' yang-dag-pa'i tshad-ma. As Steinkellner 1989 points out, the text follows the system of logic propounded in theSamdhinirmocanasutra, which differs in important aspects from the tradition of Dharmakirtiwith which Santaraksita's logical writings are affiliated. Nevertheless, Santaraksita's discipleKamalaslla does cite the Samdhinirmocanasutra on occasion, for instance, in the first and thirdBhavanakrama (Tucci 1956-1958, rprt. 1978, pp. 515, 516, 538; 1971c, p. 22). I think it istherefore unwise to rule out the possibility that Santaraksita may have taught on the basis of thissutra in Tibet, particularly if it were already available in its Tibetan translation. As the Ldan-dkar-ma catalogue makes clear, the translation of neither Dharmakirti's Pramanavarttika norSantaraksita's Tattvasamgraha had been completed even a decade or more after Khri Srong-Ide'u-btsan's death (Lalou 1953, nos. 733, 736). Though other texts on logic were available bythat time (Lalou 1953, nos. 695-722), it is by no means clear that this material would have beenfamiliar when Santaraksita was present in Tibet. In any event, Santaraksita, like Dharmaghosasanti,is usually said to have hailed from Za'ur, a toponym that has given rise to some puzzlement, andis variously placed in the east or west of India. I suspect that it transcribes Sauvlra, one of the oldnames for the region of Sindh. Interestingly, as Mitra 1971, p. 130 notes, there is evidence of thepresence of monks from this region at Odantapuri monastery, near Nalanda in Bihar.54.

This passage is largely based upon the Bhadrapalapariprcchasutra.55. Typical of later Tibetan religious attitudes in this regard is Kun-bzang bla-ma,pp. 88-92, which introduces the problem of rebirth as given and so offers no argument what-ever in support of this doctrine.56. Bu-ston, in Obermiller 1931-1932, p. 187.57. Mkhas-pa'i dga'-ston, vol. 1, pp. 304-306.58. Bod-kyi deb-ther, p. 54.59. DemieVille 1952, p. 33, mentions a maternal aunt of the Btsan-po, of the \"Si-nang-nan\" (= Tib. Sna-nam) clan, and \"more than thirty wives of the great men of the land.\" Sba-bzhed, p. 67, mentions a certain \"Lady Bodhi\" (Jo-mo Byang-chub), among others.60. Eastman 1983 provides a preliminary survey of this literature. The dating of many ofthese texts, and the nature of the communities which produced them, remain problematic.61. Spiro 1982. Applying Spiro's categories to Tibet, Samuel 1993 speaks of a \"karmaorientation\" and a \"bodhi orientation.\"62. Petech 1994 surveys the history of the empire's collapse.

Davidson 1994 provides a thoughtful account of aspects of this transition. Wylie 1977offers interesting speculations on the meaning of the term bla-ma, but on this see now Lopez1998, ch. 1. Pace Lopez, however, I am inclined to think that the term bla-ma does preservesome echo of the term bla, \"vital soul.\" Refer to Kapstein 1992b. Oral tradition among mastersof the Rnying-ma-pa school sometimes also invokes the concept of bla in this connection.64. Traditional summaries of the history of this collection are given in Dudjom 1991, vol. 1,pp. 554-555, 580-588. Germane forthcoming offers a thorough investigation of the forma-tion of the Mkha'-'gro snying-thig corpus.65. The treasures (gter-ma) are discussed in chapters 7 through 10, with references to earlierresearch in the notes to those chapters.66. Mkha'-'gro snying-thig, vol. 3, pp. 377-390. The story is repeated by Klong-chen-pa's disciple Bya-bral-pa Bzod-pa in Mkha'-'gro snying-thig, vol. 3, pp. 491-497.67. This is evident in modern retellings, e.g., Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 512-521.68. Ba-dzra-gu-ru'iphan-yon, a work probably dating to the fourteenth century (see ch. 8here), for instance, declares: \"[I]n the future, beings will have much on their minds and willbecome extremely wild.. .. When that occurs, disease, famine, and strife will spread amongall creatures, and, above all, China, Tibet, and Mongolia will become like a ravaged ants'nest, so that the subjects of Tibet will fall on hard times.\"69. Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 533-537.70. Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, p. 517. It is possible, however, that the Rnying-ma-pa tradi-tion is in fact preserving a recollection of the Dba '-bzhed, which according to Diemberger(ch. 2, n. 11), describes a \"rather unsuccessful journey of Padmasambhava.\" See also ch. 8,below.71. Padma bka'-thang, pp. 535-547.Chapter 41. Again I remind the reader that the version of the Sba-bzhed referred to here is a post-tenth-century work based on an earlier text, perhaps the recently rediscovered Dba '-bzhed(see ch. 2, n. 11). The recent publication of the latter will no doubt contribute to the refine-ment of the arguments offered in the present chapter.2. See especially Bogoslovskij 1972, pp. 52-66; Ariane Macdonald 1971; Richardson1998, esp. pp. 89-99 [1980], \"The First Tibetan chos-'byung,\" and pp. 196-202 [1992],\"Political Aspects of the Snga-dar\"; Samuel 1993, pp. 451-455; Snellgrove 1987, vol. 2,pp. 381^63; Stein 1986a; Tucci 1980, pp. 5-15. Of course, many of the other writings onaspects of early Tibetan religion and culture to which reference is made in this book also offerfundamental contributions to our understanding of the early adoption of Buddhism.3. For instance, Harvey 1990, p. 202, writes: \"Buddhism contributed to ending Asoka'swarlike expansion of his empire and tamed the warlike Tibetans and Mongolians.\" As Lopez1998, p. 7, rightly observes: \"The history of Tibet was portrayed as ... having turned, withthe introduction of Buddhism in the seventh century, from a society that had been directedoutward, to conquer the world, into one that directed all its energies inward, to conquer themind.\" Demieville, for one, clearly recognized the discrepancies between ideology and prac-tice and so rightly remarked (1952, p. 223): \"Ce n'est pas sans accrocs, deviations et entorsesque s'actualisent dans 1'histoire les principes des grandes doctrines religieuses et morales,et il serait aise de montrer comment les precepts antimilitaristes du bouddhisme furentcopieusement et perpetuellement violes par les bouddhistes d'Extreme-Orient... .\" See alsoDemieville 1957.4.

Renondeau 1957; Demieville 1957; Forte 1976; and Ling 1979 offer some useful pointsof departure for reflection on the question of Buddhism's relation to political expediency. OnBuddhism in its relation to modern Japanese nationalism, see now Heisig and Maraldo 1994,and, on the historical background of the current tragedy in Sri Lanka, Tambiah 1992. Con-cerning Tibet, particularly in recent centuries, Dawa Norbu 1985, p. 177, argues: \"The veryhistory of chos-srid gnis-ldan demonstrates that even if force is renounced in principle, it isstill a necessary part of a state's existence. . . . This does not mean no force was used in Bud-dhist Tibet; one can recall three incidents of monastic participation in warfare in this centuryalone.\" Goldstein 1989 provides a detailed account of Tibetan political life, and the role ofthe clergy within it, during the period 1911-1950.7. Even Tucci 1980, p. 12, writes: \"The attitude of Clang dar ma was doubtless in partformed by the concern he must have felt at the growing economic power of the monasteries,at their privileges and their arrogance. The steady extension of the religious community broughtthe existence of the state into serious danger. In addition there was the monasteries' freedomfrom taxation, the continual increase of their property through the assignment to them ofestates and pastures, and the growing proportion of the population working for them in agri-culture or as herdsmen, and therefore exempted from military obligation and compulsorylabour. Also, donations did not only go towards the building of a temple; in addition they hadto support the monastic community belonging to the temple, so as to secure for all time theperformance of the ceremonies directed by the donor or testator in accordance with his will.This development deprived the state of considerable resources in both men and revenue. . . .\"Neat as this may seem, Tucci offers no documentation to support his assertions here. Thoughelements of his argument are no doubt correct, the fact remains that our knowledge of theeconomy of the old Tibetan empire remains too poor to permit us to affirm his broad conclu-sions regarding the implications of Buddhist monasticism for the old Tibetan state.8. Thus, even in the tale of Tibet's first mortal king, Gri-gum-btsan-po, the king's death isbrought about by rivalry with a retainer. Evidence of feuds involving the nobles and the court isfound throughout OTA and OTC. See, for instance, Beckwith 1987, pp. 11-17; Beckwith 1983.9. A similar boom-and-bust pattern may be discerned in the histories of many ancientand medieval empires. See, e.g., Finley 1973, pp. 175-176 on the decline of Rome.10. Karmay 1972 offers a complete translation of an important Bon-po religious history;Kvasrne 1995 summarizes the Bon-po historical view in brief.11. Cf. Tucci 1971b [1947], cited in ch. 2, n. 4 above.12. This is not by any means to minimize the many advances that have already been madein these areas, especially in the contributions of Beckwith, Lalou, Petech, Richardson, Takeuchi,Thomas, Uebach, and Uray, among others (see bibliography). Despite this, a synthesis of thedata that would offer a clear account of the economic conditions of the rise and decline of theTibetan empire has not yet been achieved, though Bogoslovskij 1972 remains a pathbreakingeffort in this regard.13. The Eastern Tibetan Buddhicization of the Gesar epic illustrates this well (Stein 1956).14. I concur here with Ariane Macdonald 1971, pp. 308-309, and Stein 1986a, that Tucci'semendation of ma-lags (\"was not\") in the first sentence to ma-legs (\"was no good\") is prob-ably not warranted.

The text is in all cases basedupon that given in Mkhas-pa'i dga'-ston, vol. 1, p. 374.15. As Samuel 1993, p. 446, puts it, \"Buddhism was acceptable as a new, improvedshamanic technique, which would maintain the good fortune and welfare of the country with-out threatening the established order laid down in the past.\" Without quibbling about the useof the term \"shamanic,\" this seems generally correct. Nevertheless, it is equally clear thatthere were important factions in Tibet that did not find Buddhism acceptable in this or anyother way and reacted sharply against its introduction. We should avoid placing too muchemphasis upon apparent accommodation between Buddhism and other religious systems, atthe expense of the evidence that suggests confrontation.16. See the Bka' yang-dag tshad-ma, as cited in ch. 3, p. 45.17. Chos-skyong bka'-slob, pp. 184-185. On this dispute, see ch. 7, n. 43.18. One can point to other occasions on which worship of the protectors appears as acontentious issue. In a work connected with the germinal stage in the development of theRnying-ma-pa tradition, the Rdor-sems zhu-lan of Gnyan Dpal-dbyangs, which evidence fromDunhuang demonstrates to have been in circulation no later than the early ninth century, weread:Question: If yogins worship the deities and mother-spirits of Tibet and Khams,does that accord with the texts of yoga or not?Response: According to the declarations of Samantabhadra-Vajrasattva,The worship of worldly gods and demons as superiors,Would be like a king's acting as a commoner.Do not beseech them for your provisions, for that would contradict the verypoint of yoga. (P 5082, p. 165 [138a-5])This passage has been discussed in Eastman 1983. The entire text is translated in Kapsteinforthcoming.Similarly, writing in the thirteenth century, Sa-skya Pandita enters into controversy re-garding the appropriateness of taking refuge in the protectors. He concludes that if the pro-tectors are Buddhas or bodhisattvas, then they are already included in the refuge in the ThreeJewels, so that no special refuge in them is warranted, whereas if they are not, then by nomeans should one take refuge in them at all (Sa-pan gsung-'bum, vol. 1, p. 18).19. Weber 1964.20. Ch. 1, n. 11, and, in this chapter, n. 2.21. For example, btsan-sa means \"stronghold,\" and btsan-thabs, \"forceful means.\"22. Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956, ch. 12. Phillippe Cornu, cited in Samuel 1993, p. 162, statesthat they are \"all male, and are the spirits of past monks who have rejected their vows.\"23. The Manchu emperors, however, did attempt to appropriate btsan-po as part of a propertitle of their own, in the phrase tshe-ring gnam-gyi she-mong btsan-pos sa-steng yongs-lamnga '-sgyur-ba, \"he who exercises his rule over the whole earth owing to the steadfast (btsan-po) power of long-living heaven,\" i.e., who rules by the mandate of heaven. This occurs inthe Qing imperial proclamations published in Bod-kyi yig-tshags, beginning with no. 47, theQianlong emperor's 1790 decree to the Eighth Dalai Lama. In earlier documents, however,the equivalent phrase was tshe-ring gnam-gyi she-mong-gis da-lta yongs-la mnga'-bsgyur-ba, \"he who now exercises his rule over everything owing to the power of long-living heaven\"(Document 43, reign of Qianlong, dated 1762), or similar expressions used at least as early asthe Kangxi emperor's 1713 decree (no. 36) granting a title to the Fifth Panchen Lama. Wecan only speculate as to why btsan-po was added during the Qianlong reign, though the an-cient resonances of the expression may well have played a determining role here. To the bestof my knowledge, however, indigenous Tibetan sources never use btsan-po to describe theManchu or other Chinese monarchs."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 54-56 22924. Pelliot 1961, p. 79. The Chinese chronicle clearly reflects, however, that btsan wasmore or less correctly understood to mean \"hero,\" although it was left untranslated.25. Tucci 1971b [1955-1956], vol. 2, pp. 569-583, \"The sacral character of the kings ofancient Tibet\"; Haarh 1969; Stein 1981. On this last mentioned, see also the remarks ofSnellgrove 1987, vol. 2, p. 381.26. A particularly clear formulation of these as three interrelated phases is found in Bod-kyi deb-ther, pp. 19-23.27. The interpretation of the term gtsug-lag as it is used here has aroused considerablecontroversy, especially since the appearance of Ariane Macdonald 1971, where it was arguedthat this was the proper name of the pre-Buddhist imperial Tibetan religion. Stein 1985 veryconvincingly demonstrates that this cannot be maintained, and that the term refers broadly towhat we might term \"wisdom,\" particularly the worldly wisdom of good governance. Hahn1997 has added to this an exceptionally insightful discussion of the possible etymology ofthe term.28. Ore, lines 451^55.29. Bogoslovskij 1972, ch. 4, describes some of the social transformations that appear tohave accompanied the evolution of the empire's political organization during the sevenththrough the ninth centuries. As he remarks (p. 143) concerning the imperial legislation: \"audroit traditionnel de 1'epoque des clans, se substitua un droit de societe de classes. Le butessentiel de cette legislation etait le maintien et le renforcement des rapports de classesnaissants, rapports d'exploitation de 1'homme par l'homme.\"30. Allan Grappard, in his paper \"Ritual and the Economy of Power,\" presented to theEvans-Wentz Workshop at Stanford University in April 1997, has argued, on the basis ofSakaehara Towao's research's on Heian-period sutra-copyists in Japan, that their lives were\"as bad as that of any assembly-line worker today.\" He adds: \"Analysis of the materials andstyles of [their] clothes indicates that sutra-copyists were treated like low-rank officials, belowwhom, still, were novices and servants. A far cry from the treatment accorded to prelates, andeven more so from that of high-level officials who were granted free houses on large piecesof land in the capital and clothing made of expensive materials.\" Of course, we cannot by anymeans extrapolate from Heian Japan to contemporaneous Tibet, but we should be cautionedat least not to assume the condition of scribes to have been particularly exalted.31. This seems to be reflected in the later legends of Srong-btsan's minister Thon-miSambhota, which probably exaggerate the degree to which Indian linguistic science servedas a model for the Tibetans as early as the seventh century. However, by the early ninth cen-tury, when the emperor Khri Lde-srong-btsan issued his preface to the Sgra-sbyor-bam-gnyis(Simonsson 1957; Ishikawa 1990), it is clear that the relevance of Indian linguistics to thingsTibetan was now seriously considered. See also Verhagen 1992a; Kapstein in press.32. Particularly intriguing in this regard is the role of the Shujing, fragments of the Ti-betan paraphrase of which are preserved among the Dunhuang finds (PT 986). Refer to Coblin1991; Stein 1983, esp. p. 201ff. and 210-212.33. Despite whatever decline may have occurred in the Buddhism of Central Tibet dur-ing the century or so intervening between the collapse of the dynasty and the monastic re-vival of the mid-tenth century, it is striking that much of the Buddhist literature that had beentranslated by the imperial committees was preserved, as was the knowledge required to read 'and understand Buddhist canonical texts. It appears too that this included knowledge of thesystem of Tibetan-Sanskrit equivalencies that had been devised during the late eighth cen-tury. See ch. 1.34. Again, the lexicons and catalogues of the early ninth century strongly suggest this tohave been the case (Sakaki 1916-1925; Lalou 1953; Simonsson 1957; Ishikawa 1990).35.

My thesis, in short, is broadly compatible with Goody 1986, but probably notwith Goody 1977. For a model study of literacy during the early medieval period that meritscareful comparison with roughly contemporaneous Tibet, see Mcltterick 1989, supplementedby the articles on several aspects of early medieval literacy in Europe in Mcltterick 1990.36. Stephen F. Teiser, \"On the Idea of a Chinese Buddhist Canon,\" unpublished. I amgrateful to the author for permitting me to refer to this work-in-progress. \"Charisma\" is not aword of his choosing, however; he speaks instead of \"an ideal of power.\"37.

French 1995, 1996,follows Uray 1972b in attributing elements of Buddhist moral law to the legislation of Srong-btsan-sgam-po. Uray's work, however, was primarily an attempt to interpret the late recordfound in the sixteenth-century Mkhas-pa 'i dga '-ston. The subsequent research cited tends tosupport the view we propose here, that the Buddhist elements were elaborated long after thefact by Buddhist chroniclers, though the process of creating a Buddhist gloss on the earlyhistory of Tibetan legislation no doubt began during the late imperial period.38. Stein 1986a.39. Richardson 1998, pp. 74-81, '\"The Dharma That Came Down from Heaven'.\" A fac-simile of the original manuscript was given in the first publication of the article (Richardson1977). Stein 1986a.40. IO 370 (5), lines 1-16, following the text as given by Richardson 1998, p. 75.41. The Fifth Dalai Lama, for instance, writes in Bod-kyi deb-ther, p. 15, that \"the royalline had arisen from the exceptional power of the blessing of absolute great compassion[= AvalokitesVara in his absolute aspect]\" (don gyi thugs rje chen po'i byin rlabs kyi mthuphul du byung ba las bskrun pa'i rgyal rigs).42. Allan Grappard, \"Ritual and the Economy of Power,\" n. 30 above, makes a similarpoint about medieval Japan and the role there of \"fear of hell.\" Teiser 1988, p. 12, analagouslynotes the relationship in Tang China among \"a Buddho-Taoist pantheon staffed by bureau-cratic divinities; a systematized picture of the afterlife in heavens and hells; the involvementof Buddhist and Taoist monks as ritual specialists at critical junctures in the life of the indi-vidual and the community; and a comprehensive worldview in terms of which fate and retri-bution could be figured and the divinatory arts could be practiced.\" The promulgation of theBuddhist moral cosmology in early ninth-century Tibet is well in evidence in the first of theLdan-ma-brag inscriptions, given in Heller 1994a, appendix, p. 12. Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan'sedict, which we have cited elsewhere, (pp. 45, 53) offers further confirmation along these lines.43. On the history of Tibetan expansion in these areas, see Beckwith 1987; Wang Xiaofu,Tang Tufan Dasi zhengzhi guanxi shi.44. We have earlier seen (pp. 41-42) that the monks brought to Tibet by the princess ofJincheng were from Khotan. In the early ninth century, the Sgra- 'byor bam-gnyis (Ishikawa1990) specifies that the Buddhist preceptors active in the court were from nyi-'og, Skt.aparantaka, the western regions—that is, countries to the northwest of India.45. On the question of Khotanese influence in the development of Tibetan artistic tradi-tions, refer to Vitali 1990, pp. 6-8, 11-15, 52-54, though, as Vitali argues in the last passagecited, Li-lugs, \"Khotanese style,\" may in fact refer sometimes to the style of Xixia and notKhotan.46.

The development of Angkor Wat in the Khmer kingdom (ninth century), Barabudurin the Sailendra domains in Java (late eighth century), and Todai-ji in Heian Japan (eighthcentury) are all suggestively close to the period of Bsam-yas's foundation.54. It is likely, however, that some Tibetans had already been receiving ordination in non-Tibetan monastic communities (Snellgrove 1987, vol. 2, p. 420).55. Chayet 1988, 1990; Memet 1988.56.

Richardson 1998 [1990], pp. 177-181, \"The Cult of Vairocana in Early Tibet.\"59. This association appears most clearly in the case of Tabo, founded by the late tenth-century West Tibetan ruler Ye-shes-'od and located in Himachal Pradesh; see now Klimberg-Salter 1998.60. Thus, in the introduction to the Sgra- 'byor bam-gnyis, Khri Lde-srong-btsan famouslydeclares: \"The tantras of secret mantra, according to the texts, are to be kept secret. It is alsonot appropriate to explain and to teach them to the unqualified. Still, in the meantime, thoughit has been permitted to translate and to practice them, there have been those who have notdeciphered what is expounded allusively, and seizing upon literal understanding have prac-ticed perversely. It is stipulated that, among the tantras of mantra, there have also been somehaphazardly translated into the Tibetan language. This being so, hereafter it is not permit-ted to translate haphazardly the tantras of mantra and the mantra-terms except for thosedharanimantras and tantras whose translations have been enjoined on order from above\"(Ishikawa 1990, p. 4).61. Refer to the studies mentioned in ch. 1, n. 49.62. See, for example, Bernard Frank 1991, pp. 163-185, \"La replique du mandala sculpt6du Toji.\"63. See Malandra 1993, pp. 71-90, on the development of the group of eight bodhisattvasin India, in particular in the iconography of the Ellora caves. Heller 1994b surveys ninth-century representations of Vairocana known from eastern Tibet and adjacent areas, severalof which are also surrounded by the eight bodhisattvas. Despite my reference here to theMahdvairocanabhisambodhi, we must be very cautious about interpreting the precise rela-tions between texts and icons until we have achieved a better understanding of the ritualsinvolving these deities that were promulgated in the times and places under consideration. AsKuo Li-ying 1994, pp. 152 and 158, suggests, any number of differing liturgical traditionsmay be involved. The occurrence in Kuo's work of the eight bodhisattvas in a confessionalcontext is also of much interest, given that at Ldan-ma-brag they are depicted accompaniedby an inscription concerning karma and rebirth (see n. 42 in this chapter).64. Evidence of this may be also seen in the liturgy for the seven tathagatas authored bySantaraksita on behalf of the Tibetan king (P 3953, in vol. 80, pp. 38-52), where the colo-phon (p. 52, plate 5) specifies that the composition is intended to \"promote the longevity ofthe divine Tsenpo, the son of the gods, Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan, and to make firm his crown,"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"232 Notes to Pages 62-64elevate his royal authority, purify his karmic obscurations, and increase his provisions [ofmerit and gnosis]. . ..\" (dpal lha btsanpo lha sras khri srong Ide'u btsan gyi sku tshe bsringba dang/dbu rmog brtsanpa dang/chab srid mtho ba dang/las sgrib sbyang ba dang/tshogsgnyis spel ba'i ched du. .. .).

I am inclined to regard this text, at least in the form in which it is preserved, aspseudepigraphic, though it may be based in part upon an authentic early work.69.

Among the problems we face here, one of the foremost remains the precise identifi-cation of the works that can be securely attributed to the eighth-century author Buddhagupta.For instance, though Lalou 1953, no. 322, is the sole commentary on the Mahavairocanab-hisambodhi attributed to this master in the Ldan-kar-ma catalogue, the Peking edition ofthe Tanjur lists three commentaries on the same text by this author: P 3486, 3487, and 3490.(Though \"Buddhaguhya\" is the form of the name used in P, \"Buddhagupta\" is consistentlyused in the Ldan-kar-ma.) [N.B. As this book goes to press it has been announced thatStephen Hodge has translated, and is due to publish shortly, one of these commentaries byBuddhaguhya.]74. The iconographic resemblance by itself, of course, does not confirm that the sametexts and liturgies are involved.75. Heller 1994a, 1994b, 1997a, 1997b.76. See Richardson, cited in Heller 1994a; the Dunhuang manuscript in question is PT996, first studied in Lalou 1939.77. Richardson 1998 [1997], pp. 207-215, is inclined to draw skeptical conclusions regardingthe Wencheng princess's actual influence. He writes (p. 212) that she was \"a dim figure . . .who made no mark on either Tibetan or Chinese history in the remaining thirty years of her life[following Srong-btsan sgam-po's death], and whose religious affiliation is uncertain. ...\"78.

In additionto these images, a unique gilt bronze statue has appeared on the international art market de-picting exactly the same icon. The quality is very fine, and the statue is stylistically unlikeanything else known so far, though it resembles the reliefs and murals just mentioned in manytelling points of detail, e.g., the pattern in the textiles of the Buddha's robes. It seems plau-sible, though given the object's uniqueness this remains uncertain, that it is indeed an au-thentic imperial Tibetan bronze, and if it is, then it is surely significant that it represents thefigure that I have begun to think of as the Tibetan Imperial Vairocana.80.

Tibetan ethnonyms are frequently multivalent and must be interpreted with cautionaccording to context. Tibetanists may wish to ponder in this regard such common designa-tions as sog-po (\"Mongolian,\" but no doubt originally \"Sogdian\"), hor-pa (referring to anynumber of Turkic and Mongolian peoples, or Tibetanized peoples possibly of Turkic orMongolian extraction, and probably derived from \"Uighur\"), mon-pa (used for many peoplesof Tibet's southern frontiers, including, in earlier times, the people of present-day Bhutan),etc. Even bod-pa, \"Tibetan,\" in some contexts refers restrictively to the people of CentralTibet in contrast to eastern Tibetans. The fluid use of ethnonyms we find in Tibet is by nomeans an uncommon phenomenon elsewhere in Inner Asia.2. Deb-dmar, p. 18, n. 138, for instance, mentions ka'u-hi(< ka'u-li). The work in ques-tion was written during the period 1346-1363. Joachim Karsten and Leonard van der Kuijphave indicated to me that they have located other, similar references in works of the Yuanand early Ming. On the other hand, the earliest Korean references to Tibet date to the Tangperiod: the pilgrim Hye Ch'o, who traveled to India during the early part of the eighth cen-tury, mentions Tibet on several occasions (Yang Han-sung et al., pp. 44, 47, 48) and signifi-cantly remarks, \"The king and the common people do not know Buddhism. There are no mon-asteries. ...\" Koreans also gained some familiarity with Tibet under the Mongols; the retiredking Ch'ungs6n was in fact exiled to Tibet during the third decade of the fourteenth century(Sohn, Kim, and Hong 1970, p. 118).

Sba-bzhed, p. 7, and Stein 1961, p. 6, read sbos grir, which makes no sense to me.Mkhas-pa'i dga'-ston, vol. 1, p. 301, has rbab grir, defined in Tshig-mdzod chen-mo, vol. 2,p. 2010, as gyen gzar nas thur du Ihung ba 'am, ri rdo thog bab tu phog pa 'i shi rkyen, \"fall-ing down a steep declivity, or death caused by the fall of stones from above.\" I have adoptedthe latter signification for my translation, though the former is equally feasible. The wordgri, \"knife,\" is frequently used in compounds to mean \"fatal danger of...,\" e.g., Itog-gri,\"starvation,\" skom-gri, \"dying of thirst.\"14. Stein 1961, p. 6, reads nyi ma ha shang.15. In Stein 1961, p. 6, this is abridged slightly.16. See ch. 2, n. 27.17. Mu-stegs rig-byed-kyi chos. Stein 1961, p. 7, reads mu-stegs-byed-kyi chos, \"doctrinesof non-Buddhists.\"18.

Kalgren's reconstructions have been surpassed by more recentrefinements in Chinese historical linguistics but are nevertheless adequate for our present,modest purposes.21. Master Kim is better known in the Chinese Chan tradition by his ordination name,Wuxiang (Musang in Korean). The hagiography drawn from the Lidai fabao ji is translatedin Lee 1993, pp. 221-222. It is perhaps significant, in the light of the Tibetan account, that heis described there as living \"at the foot of a boulder on Mount T'ien-ku. ... Even savagebeasts were moved [by his austerities] and protected him.\" He later moves to the JingchuanMonastery in Chengdu, where he teaches \"the people the path of conversion.\" The hagiographyfurther mentions that, during the twelfth and first month of every year, he granted publicmeditation instruction. The phrase used in the Tibetan account, which I have translated liter-ally as \"meditation transmission\" (sgom-lung), would be an appropriate term to use to de-scribe a public teaching of this type.22. Beckwith 1983.23. See ch. 2, n. 15, on the recently discovered Dba'-bzhed. The episode involving mas-ter Kim is treated there on pp. 47-52 of the translation (text fols. 8b-10b).24. As Broughton 1983, p. 7 and n. 29, notes, Obata holds it to be likely that the Tibetanenvoys encountered not Kim, but rather the latter's soi-disant disciple Wuzhu, whose lineageclaims the Lidai fabao ji underwrites. Wuzhu is himself frequently cited in the Tibetan Chanscroll PT 116, which clearly has the Lidai fabao ji in its background.25. An introduction to, and partial edition and translation of, this singularly importantmanuscript may be found in Mala and Kimura 1988.26. The Tibetan manuscript PT 116 consistently uses bsam-gtan-gyi mdo, which accord-ing to the standard conventions for Tibetan translations of Sanskrit would be dhyanasutra,"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 72-74 235i.e., *chdnjmg in Chinese. As the conventions for translating Chinese were not always iden-tical with those used for Indian texts (Stein 1983), however, and as lun and notjlng is theChinese term used to designate the discourses attributed to the Chan masters, it is preferableto reconstruct *Chdnlun in this context. We should note, too, that by the middle of the ninthcentury several other expressions were current in Chinese to denote the \"recorded sayings\"of Chan masters: see Yanagida 1983b.27. Owing to the unexplained syllable hu(n), Broughton 1983, p. 13, rightly expressed somereservations about this. Shen-shi (or shan-shi in some sources), occurring throughout the oldTibetan Chan literature, has already been interpreted by Tucci 1956-1958 and Demieville 1952,1979, as a transciption of chdnshi, \"Chan master.\" Yamaguchi, following the reading shang shita found in some sources, has argued that their interpretation is incorrect, but I am inclined toagree here with Tucci and Demieville and to see shang shi ta as a late hypercorrection, perhapsinfluenced by Sanskrit samsita, \"praised.\" The occurrence in the present instance of shen-shihas caused us to read Kim-hu(ri) as a bisyllabic name, which gives rise to some puzzlement; andthis reading is reinforced by the Tibetan sources themselves, which sometimes give the name inthis form alone, not followed by shen-shi (e.g., PT 116, plate 177.4). It is possible, however,that hu(n)-shen-shi was originally a single phrase, representing heshangshi, \"master preceptor,\"that has been deformed by a Tibetan copyist who has written shen-shi so frequently that he hasassimilated the former phrase to it. This being done, it became possible to drop the honorificphrase shen-shi altogether, leaving only Kim-hu(n). If this is approximately correct, the iden-tification with master Kim of the author to whom the passages in question are attributed nolonger poses a great problem. A second possibility, suggested to me by John Jorgensen, is thatKim's association with tigers in fact does originate with Chinese traditions (see n. 21 in thischapter), in which case Kim-hu might mean \"Tiger Kim.\"28. Broughton 1983, p. 13, translates: \"At the time that one is not possessed of the realitysphere in the mind, there is no understanding.\" But I think this misses the point here. The textis saying that one who has achieved genuine insight does not engage in further seeking andthe hankering that involves, even at times when the experience of realization is not in theforeground.29. PT 116, plates 174.2-175.1.30. Tib. tshor-ba, translated here as \"intuition,\" regularly represents Ch. jue, \"awaken-ing, enlightenment,\" in Tibetan Chan documents. In the Sanskrit Buddhist vocabulary, it standsfor vedana, \"feeling, sensation.\"31. PT 116, plates 177.3-178.2.32. The hagiography found in the Lidaifabao ji, for instance, has this saying (Lee 1993,p. 222): \"With the absence of thought, the mind is like a bright mirror that reflects all phe-nomena. The rise of thought is like the back of a mirror that cannot reflect anything.\"33. Cf. Randall 1962, p. 119: \"The Reformers made salvation a purely religious problem,not dependent upon human conduct at all. ... Luther's mysticism led him to make religionnon-moral, a matter of inner experience. ...\"34. Gomez 1983b surveys the citations attibuted to Moheyan in Dunhuang Tibetan texts.35. Bsam-gtan mig-sgron, pp. 119-120, 161. The name is transcribed here as Kin-hunand Kyin-hu.

The episode is also recounted summarily,without mentioning Kim by name, in BA, p. 41.38. See p. 160, where Tibet, China, and Mongolia are compared to a teeming ants' nest.39. Indeed, Kim already seems to have suffered erasure even in the pre-Yuan-period Ti-betan histories that have so far become available.

Hence,Kim was to all intents and purposes forgotten long before any provocation of anti-Chinesesentiment under the Yuan.40. On Padmasambhava, see ch. 8.41. Petech 1994.42. Davidson 1994.43. Piotrovsky 1993; Dunnell 1996.44. There are many objections to this suggestion, of course. Deities and religious heroesdepicted as riding upon or accompanied by tigers are very widespread, so that it would bedifficult to identify a unique source for a particular image. The heavenly-master tradition ofTaoism in Sichuan, for example, depicts its founder, Zhang Daoling, riding upon a tiger, andthe arhat Dharmatrata is similarly represented. Tibet is replete with protective divinities knownas stag-zhon, \"tiger riders,\" as well. The motif of the Buddhist pilgrim (sometimes identifiedwith Xuanzang) accompanied by a tiger is well known in paintings from Dunhuang; for ex-ample, in the Pelliot collection of the Musee Guimet, nos. 206, 207, and 208 in the catalogueof Nicolas-Vandier et al. 1974-1976. Though these considerations do diminish the prospectsfor finding an antecedent of Padmasambhava's Rdo-rje gro-lod form in master Kim, we mustrecall, too, that, as we have seen in ch. 3. Padmasambhava does appear to have absorbed as-pects of some of the Chinese teachers mentioned in the Sba-bzhed, so the suggestion cannotquite be ruled out.45. See especially Karmay 1988a; Ruegg 1989; D. Jackson 1994.46. Lalou 1939; Heller 1994a. Heller credits Richardson with calling her attention to theidentity of the names mentioned in the Ldan-ma-brag inscription with those found in Lalou1939.47. The Ldan-ma-brag inscription, studied in Heller 1994a, as we have seen in ch. 4,emphasizes karmic reward and retribution and is found in conjunction with a relief image ofBuddha Vairocana and the eight major bodhisattvas. The continuing insistence on immediateand intuitive enlightment, however, is very much in evidence in PI1996, first studied in Lalou1939.48. Gomez 1983b, on surveying the Dunhuang fragments attributed to Moheyan, remarks(p. 89): \"The total picture of Mo-ho-yen as a 'Dhyana Master' that we can derive from thesefragments does not contradict the generally held view that he espoused a radical sudden en-lightenment position... .\"49.

Indeed, the structure of Lce-sgom-rdzong-pa's work closely resembles that of the Lam-mchog mthar-thug of the controversial early Bka'-brgyud master, Bla-ma Zhang (1123-1193),for a translation of which see Martin 1992. Refer also to D. Jackson 1994, ch. 3.68. The renowned Dge-lugs-pa encyclopedist Klong-rdol Ngag-dbang-blo-bzang (1719—1795), for example, refers favorably to Lce-sgom-rdzong-pa's work no less than three times:Klong-rdol gsung-'bum, vol. 2, pp. 112, 337, 498.69. I am grateful to Geshe Sonam Rinchen of the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives,Dharmasala, for taking the time to meet regularly with me to discuss this and other textsthroughout the spring of 1993.70. The later Tibetan meditation manuals also derive many citations of well-known sutras,such as the Lankavatara or the Vajracchedika, from the earlier Chan compilations. However,because these may also be drawn from non-Sinitic traditions, compared to the quotations ofthe Chinese apocryphal scriptures, they are not of similar value for historical research. It is,for example, Lce-sgom-rdzong-pa's citation of the Vajrasamadhi, not the Vajracchedika, thatassures us that the Chan florilegia were indeed among his ultimate sources.71. On this figure see Demieville 1952, pp. 20-21; Inaba 1977; Ueyama 1983, n. 1;Verhagen 1992b.72. T 4016; P 5517.73. Large parts of the Chinese text, however, have survived: refer to Inaba 1977.74. The manuscript or printed versions of the canon kept behind or surrounding the altarsof Tibetan Buddhist temples serve a ritual function and represent the presence of the PreciousJewel of the Dharma as an object of refuge. Ritual interactions with the canon may includeoffering prostrations before it, or performing circumambulations while carrying several heavyvolumes as an act of merit. (This last I have noticed particularly practiced by women of theMongour [Ch. Tuzu] communities of Qinghai.) One ritual that does require some reading of thecanon, or at least the rapid recitation of the first pages of each volume, is Bka'- 'gyur zhal-klog,which involves the volumes only of the Kanjur, not of the Tanjur. In a similar vein, the ritualtransmission of the canon, or dial-lung, which is performed by a teacher reading aloud thoseportions of the text he has himself heard recited in this way from his teacher, continues to bepracticed in connection with the entire Kanjur, but only about 20% of the Tanjur is still transmittedin this manner. (I am indebted to the late Dezhung Rinpoche for this information.)75. I do not mean to suggest here that reading is a uniform practice in our own society.Reading is obviously multivalent, and just what we mean by \"to read\" differs according to"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"238 Notes to Pages 78-79text, context, purpose, etc.; and this was also true in Tibet. Nevertheless, it is probably fair tosay that the practice of reading in Tibet was restricted in ways with which we, in contempo-rary secular societies, are not very familiar, above and beyond the restrictions imposed by thephysical limitations of manuscript and block-print reproduction. The late Kalu Rinpoche, forexample, remarked to me on one occasion that whereas a Tibetan would seldom look furtherthan the title of a tantric text into which she or he had not been initiated, he found that hisWestern students had few inhibitions along these lines. He did not mean this to be a compli-ment: his point in the conversation was that he found the ritual framework for textual studyto be compromised outside of a traditional Tibetan setting. Tibetan reading practices, and thetraditional educational practices through which they were formed, however, have yet to bewell studied, and my comments about this subject are therefore somewhat impressionistic.On the question of religious reading in general, see now Griffiths 1999.76. By referring to a \"very small number of texts,\" I intend no slight: Tibetan monk-schol-ars pursued their education with a thoroughness we can scarcely imagine, combining memo-rization, discussion, and debate, until the key elements of the curriculum were mastered indetail, a process requiring fifteen or more years of rigorous study. Aspects of education atBla-brang monastery in A-mdo are surveyed in Li An-che 1982, ch. 2. On the curriculum,see also Hopkins 1999, pp. 9-12. Goldstein, in Goldstein and Kapstein 1998, ch. 2, examinesmatters relating to the economy of education at 'Bras-spungs. For remarks on monastic edu-cation in relation to soteriological ends, see Dreyfus 1997b. Dreyfus is now engaged in de-tailed research on Tibetan monastic education, and his results will no doubt help to illumi-nate some of the issues raised here.77. Nevertheless, it is important to stress that there was a tradition of bibliographicalconnoisseurship that often did focus upon rarely studied texts and traditions. This is evident,for instance, in bibliographical writings such as the Dpe-rgyun dkon-pa tho-yig (The Inven-tory of Rare Books) of A-khu Shes-rab-rgya-mtsho (1803-1875), among many others. How-ever, it is striking that for the most part such bibliophilia was focused upon rare Tibetan booksand authors, whose relevance for the living traditions of Tibetan Buddhism was relativelyclear. The interest, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, among Rnying-ma-pa masters in eastern Tibet in recovering the Mun-pa'i go-cha and Bsam-gtan mig-sgronof the tenth-century adept Bsnubs-chen Sangs-rgyas-ye-shes is an instance in point. In thecase of unstudied books in the canonical collections, however, the physical rarity of the textswas not particularly at issue; at issue was the motivation to delve into them at all.78. Thurman 1984; Hopkins 1999.79. Sparham 1993.80. The extensive commentarial writings on Tsong-kha-pa's Legs-bshad-snying-po arestudied in Hopkins 1999, where the commentarial tradition on the text is introduced in gen-eral, pp. 16-25. Hopkins remarks (p. 23, n. c) that he has so far collected twenty-six com-mentaries on Tsong-kha-pa's text. Only one, though, seems to be based in large measure ondetailed examination of W6nch' fik' s work itself, beyond the citations already given by Tsong-kha-pa. This is the altogether remarkable commentary of the recent A-mdo master ' Jigs-med-dam-chos-rgya-mtsho (1898-1946). (Hopkins's remarks on p. 24, though, suggest that Gung-thang Dkon-mchog-bstan-pa'i-sgron-me [1762-1823; Hopkins mistakenly gives 1728-1791]also may have made some independent use of WSnch'uk.)81. Thurman 1984, p. 205, n. 50; Powers 1992.82. We must recall in this context that Tsong-kha-pa was active during the early Mingperiod, when many Tibetan hierarchs had intensive dealings with the Chinese court, follow-ing the precedents for religious relations with the Mongol court established under the Yuan.As Franke 1996 makes very clear, there had been sufficient interaction so that learned Tibet-ans during the fourteenth century would have known much more of Chinese Buddhism thanjust the account of Moheyan."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 79-81 23983. Powers 1992, n. 10.84. Of the Tibetanists who have considered Tsong-kha-pa's relation to W5nch'uk, it is sofar only Hopkins 1999, p. 46, who rightly suggests that Tsong-kha-pa may have had predeces-sors who also drew upon the Korean commentator. The repeated emphasis that we find throughoutWestern writings on Tibetan Buddhism on describing Tsong-kha-pa as a \"reformer,\" implyingan analogy to Western Christian reformers such as Luther and Calvin, is deeply misleading andhas wrongly skewed our understanding of Tsong-kha-pa. Even when considering relatively smallpoints, such as his references to W6nch'uk, the tendency has been to presuppose novelty, andtherefore not to examine carefully his relationship with earlier tradition. Many of the distinctivefeatures of Tsong-kha-pa's approach to Buddhist teaching are clearly presaged, however, in thecareer of his Sa-skya-pa teacher Red-mda'-ba (1349-1412), for instance, his emphasis uponthe Bka'-gdams-pa Lam-rim teachings, the insistence upon the primacy of Candraklrti amongMadhyamikas, and the fundamental position of the Gukyasamaja in his approach to tantrism. Itremains unclear, moreover, whether there is good evidence of the formation of a distinctivesectarian identity on the part of Tsong-kha-pa and his disciples during Tsong-kha-pa's ownlifetime, though this seems to have emerged soon after his passing. It is true, however, that Tsong-kha-pa did elaborate a distinctive philosophical position, particularly in reference to Yogacafaand Madhyamaka thought, and that this early on became a matter of doctrinal controversy. Eventhis, however, in the context of early fifteenth-century Tibet, must be seen as controversy withinthe tradition, and not as part of a movement at all similar to the Reformation.85.

This distinction is made explicit by the use of the terms rigs-pas rjes-su 'brangs-pa,\"rationalist,\" and dad-pas rjes-su 'brangs-pa, \"fideist.\" A fine example of the distinction is foundin the famous Tshad-ma lam-rim (The Progressive Path of Pramana) of Lcang-skya Rol-pa'irdo-rje, Lcang-skya mam-thar, p. 636: 'This Pramanavarttika is a superlative treatise!

A caveat is required here, for there is a sense in which the privileging of particulartexts, doctrines, or practices is standard procedure in Tibetan Buddhist circles, and not at alla peculiarity of Dolpopa's approach. Nevertheless, I think that it is fair to say that Dolpopa'suse of selected key texts and passages, as will be illustrated here, at the very least exemplifieswith unusual sharpness the role of the proof text in Tibetan dogmatics.12.

Thus, for instance, in the third chapter of Sa-skya Pandita's Mkhas-'jug, concerninglogic and debate, he describes purposeful debate as that which \"takes up truths that accordwith the doctrine, while abandoning errors,\" and he extols such debate as \"a cause of theteaching's increase\" (text in Jackson 1987, p. 251, line 7, and p. 296, lines 7-8), but nowheredoes he seem to suggest that mastery of Pramana will conduce directly to enlightenment. Therelationship between the study of Pramana and Buddhism's soteriological ends was a con-tested issue in Tibet, and the interpretation of this matter has given rise to some confusion incontemporary scholarship, which often misleadingly treats it as a dispute between \"secular\"and \"religious\" understandings of Pramana, though there is clearly no distinction made, in atraditional context, that closely conforms with the Western notions this involves. For a judi-cious survey of the question, see Dreyfus 1997a, ch. 27. Cf. also Kapstein 1988b.42. Aryabhadracaripranidhanaraja, verses 39-40.43.

Unfortunately there is no available dkar-chag giving a complete list of the contentsof the Rgya-mtsho mtha '-yas. While no complete set of Rgya-mtsho mtha '-yas has been lo-cated to date, some were in circulation in Tibet: the Rnying-ma-pa Bla-ma Bsod-nams stobs-rgyal, presently of Toronto, has told me of such a set that was kept at the home of an uncle inKhams Ri-bo-che. See Kapstein 1985, p. 359, n. 2, for remarks on the marginalia of the presentmanuscript.45. The author refers to himself as Rang-byung rdo-rje at Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, 1.29,207, 435, 467, 637,11.453, and elsewhere; and as \"Bla-ma Karma-pa\" at 1.637.46. On Rang-byung rdo-rje's astronomical contributions, see Schuh 1973, pp. 34-36. Rang-byung rdo-rje's great work on yoga is the Zab-mo nang-gi don, a good modern xylographicedition of which is available at Rumtek Monastery, Sikkim. The autocommentary, thoughlong unavailable, has recently reemerged: I am grateful to Ven. Rdzogs-chen Dpon-slob Rin-po-che for his efforts to make this text available to me. For examples of his contemplativeworks, see Gdams-ngag mdzod, vol. 6.47. This is not found in the present edition of Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas.

The first occurrence of this name in Pakshi'i rang-rnam is on p. 16, line 1. Note thatin addition to the names given here, Karma Pakshi also had the ordination name of \"Chos-kyi-bla-ma,\" which he received from the Rnying-ma-pa hierarch Byams-pa-'bum of Kah-thog(1179-1252), certainly the major source of his Rnying-ma-pa doctrinal background (Dudjom1991, vol. 1, pp. 693-694).

The study of this work may well help to clarify further Karma Pakshi'ssources of inspiration.54. See, for instance, Pakshi'i rang-rnam, pp. 21-22, 79-80. Significant in this regard isthe remark made to me by the late Ven. Gnas-nang Dpa'-bo Rin-po-che in July 1981: \"Rang-byung-rdo-rje is the name of all the Karma-pas.\" The Sems-dpa' Rang-byung-rdo-rje of KarmaPakshi's autobiography is a form of the bodhisattva AvalokitesVara, who is thought to be theground for the emanation (sprul-gzhi) of the Karma-pas.55. Mkhas-pa'i dga'-ston, 11.927; Karma-pa'i mdzad-rnam, p. 119.56. Indeed, according to the account of O-rgyan-pa' s recognition of the infant third Karma-pa given in Mkhas-pa'i dga'-ston, 11.926-929, it is evident that some among Karma Pakshi'sformer disciples were extremely reticent, at least initially, to accept this as a valid succes-sion. It must be emphasized that the notion of there being identifiable rebirths of deceasedmasters was not in itself an innovation; what was new was the effort to tie actual inheritanceto such identification.57. Following the passing of the sixteenth Karma-pa in 1981, two of his leading disciples,Ta'i Si-tu Rin-po-che and Zhwa-dmar Rin-po-che, recognized opposing candidates. Theformer's, O-rgyan Phrin-las, was installed as the seventeenth Karma-pa at the traditional seatof the order at Mtshur-phu monastery in Central Tibet, where he commands very broad alle-giance in Tibet itself, and among important elements of the Tibetan communities in India andNepal. The Zhwa-dmar's candidate, who resides in New Delhi, has a smaller following, whichstrongly insists, however, upon the unique legitimacy of his claim. In late 1999 O-rgyan Phrin-las left Tibet to continue his education in India.58. See n. 53.59. Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 688-699.60. For convenient summaries, see Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 223-237, 346-372.61. These are commonly referred to by the acronym mdo-rgyud-sems-gsum, \"the trioof the sutra, tantra, and mind.\" (The first two are named in reverse order for reasons ofeuphony.) The history of this tradition is the main topic of Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, book 2, pt. 5.62. See n. 81.63. Demieville 1973; Douglas and White 1976; Karma Thinley 1978; Rossabi 1988,pp. 40-41; Petech 1990, pp. 14-16.64. This is discussed in the seventh Karma-pa's Rigs-gzhung rgya-mtsho, vol. 1, p. 76ff.65. Pakshi'i rang-rnam, p. 25. Of the available texts, three have titles that include the phraseLimitless Ocean of the Teaching: (1) Bstan-pa rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas-kyi spyi-gzhung chen-mortogs-pa rab-'byams chos-dbyings ye-shes Inga-ldan, = Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, 1.25-208; (2)Glegs-bam 'dir bstan-pa rgya-mtsho mtha '-yas-kyi bshad-pa phun-sum-tshogs-pa, = Rgya-mtshomtha'-yas, 1.209-470; and (3) Bstan-pa rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas byin-gyis-rlabs-pa'i bka'-chen, =Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, 1.471-601. Judging on the basis of the contents of these, my guess is thatif the reference in the passage cited is not to Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas as a whole, then it is to (1).66. Pakshi'i rang-rnam, p. 86.67. Pakshi'i rang-rnam, p. 84. It is not entirely clear whether Ye-shes rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas refers to a text, or to the enlightenment that is the goal of the Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas.68. For the name \"Rang-byung rdo-rje,\" see Mkhas-pa'i dga'-ston, 11.897, 904, 906, 910,etc.; and Karma-pa'i mdzad-rnam, pp. 83, 85, 101, etc. For the Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, seeMkhas-pa'i dga'-ston, 11.885,906; and Karma-pa'i mdzad-rnam, p. 85.

Karma-pa'i mdzad-rnam,pp. 107-108, mentions that there are six volumes of Karma Pakshi's writings presently in the\"human world.\"69. Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, 1.603-637.70. Presently unavailable."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"244 Notes to Pages 101-10471. Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, 1.45.72. The question here is whether the round of rebirth has a fixed stock of sentient crea-tures, or whether genuinely \"new\" beings are sometimes produced.73. Contemporary Western logics generally hold that between any two entities, a and b,there must be some relationship or another that can be posited as a value for R in a statement ofthe form Rob, \"a is /{-related to b,\" as, for example, \"the Potala is very far from (= R) Mars.\"Karma Pakshi, however, in referring to \"connections\" in this passage, means either of the twotypes of relation that Buddhist epistemologists considered significant: causal relations, and whatWestern philosophers sometimes term \"internal relationships,\" i.e., relationships that are intrinsicto the relata (e.g., the relation of a pot to its materiality). Kapstein 1989c outlines the Dharmakirti' stheory of relations, with which Karma Pakshi was certainly familiar.74. Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, 1.611-613.75. Sa-chen Kun-dga'-snying-po (1092-1158), in his Rgyud-sde spyi'i rnam-gzhag chung-ngu (in Sa-skya bka'-'bum, vol. 1, pp. 5-9), cites the same passage but understands 'dod-pain its more primary sense of \"desire\" and not \"tenets.\"76.

To assess Karma Pakshi's view of other religions, it isessential that we take account not merely of his doctrinal viewpoint, which was derived fromBuddhist textual sources, but also of his practical dealings with the religious life of the Mon-gol empire. A number of interesting passages may be found in Pakshi'i rang-rnam, e.g.,pp. 21-22, where he claims to have sponsored the restoration and new construction of non-Buddhist (phyi-rol mu-stegs-pa) shrines, and pp. 101-102, where he notes with approval anedict promulgated by Mo'ngke Khan directing all to adhere to the vows of their own religions(thams-cad rang-rang-gi grub-mtha' dang 'thun-par [sic!] sdom-pa srung-ba'i 'ja'-sa). Thislatter reference occurs in connection with an assembly of the royal line at Sira-ordos duringa dragon year (certainly = 1256; 'brug-gi lo-la zi-ra- 'ur-rdor rgyal-rgyud thams-cad 'tshogs-pa'i dus), at which Karma Pakshi also claims to have turned the Khan and his immediatecircle away from other religions and to have converted them to Buddhism (mu-stegs-kyi grub-mtha'-las rje-'bangs thams-cad bzlog-cing/nang-pasangs-rgyaspa'i-bstan-pa-labtsud. . . .).One is tempted to associate all this with the famed Buddhist-Taoist controversy of 1255-1256.It has been hypothesized that Karma Pakshi is none other than the somewhat mysterious LamaNa-mo, though the evidence for this identification is not to be found in the present sources(see, e.g., Demieville 1973, esp. pp. 205-209 and n. 29). Pakshi's fanciful etymologizing ofmu-stegs-pa no doubt has its origin in earlier Rnying-ma-pa sources, and it reappears in laterdoxographical writing, as well. (TTrthika in Sanskrit is derived from tirtha, the ford of a river,and is used also for sacred places for ritual ablutions. The Tibetan coinage that was contrivedto represent this foreign idea, mu-stegs, was no doubt intended to refer to a bathing platform[stegs] on the bank [mu] of a river. Though this was well known to scholars of the canonicalcommentaries, it is easy to see how it might also be taken to mean \"approaching [stegs] thelimit [mu]\" and so give rise to more extravagant etymological speculations.) 'Jam-dbyangs-bzhad-pa, for instance, is sharply critical of Stag-tshang Lo-tsa-ba Shes-rab-rin-chen (b. 1405)for defining the term in this way (Grub-mtha' chen-mo, p. 80). At the same time, there are noauthors known to me besides Karma Pakshi who actually sought to invoke this definition ina context in which it seems to have clear political entailments.82. The mahayoga system of the Guhyagarbhatantra is summarized in Dudjom 1991,vol. 1, pp. 275-283, 359-363. Guenther 1984 offers an interpretation of the Guhyagar-bhatantra based upon the commentary of Klong-chen Rab-'byams-pa."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 104-105 24583. dgongs pa 'dul ba gsang ba dang// ma nogs pa dang log par nogs// phyogs nogsyang dag nyid ma nogs//don dam 'di la the tsom za//Cf., e.g., Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, 1.26,30, 210, 632-633,11.53, etc. Karma Pakshi himself refers to the source at 1.210 as being theRgyud-kyi rgyal-po gsang-ba 'i snying-po de-kho-na-nyid nges-par 'byung-ba. The passagehe is paraphrasing in this verse may be found on folio 30a of the Rumtek xylographic editionof that text.84. According to Vilasavajra's influential commentary on the Guhyagarbha, \"non-realization\" refers to ordinary mundane folk; \"mistaken realization\" to those who adhereto nihilism or eternalism, i.e., the non-Buddhists; \"partial realization\" to the Sravakas,Pratyekabuddhas, and adherents of the Vijnaptimatratavada; \"not realizing what is genuine\"to the Madhyamikas; and \"intention, discipline, and esotericism\" to the followers of the lowertantras. See Gsang-snying Rgyud-'grel, vol. 1, pp. 160-161.85. Rong-zom gsung-btus, p. 20. Rong-zom-pa' s quotation agrees precisely with the tantra.On Rong-zom-pa (eleventh century), see Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 703-709.86. Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, 1.210.87. The nine-yana system is taught throughout Rnying-ma-pa tantric traditions but has aspecial association with the anuyoga teaching owing to the great emphasis it receives in theprimary tantra of the anuyoga, the Mdo dgongs-pa 'dus-pa, in connection with which the nine-yanas form the basis for the initiatory progression of the rites of empowerment. This becamea matter of some controversy, as it required the conferral of tantric empowerments for thenontantric yanas of the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas. On this, refer to Dudjom,vol. 1, pp. 911-913. For more on the teaching of the Mdo dgongs-pa 'dus-pa, see also ch. 9in the present work.88. Sog-bzlog-pa, vol. 2, p. 135. Though not referring to the Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas byname, Sog-bzlog-pa does mention, among other works of Karma Pakshi, a Dgongs- 'dus-kyidon so-sor-dbye-ba. This may be a reference to the lengthy anuyoga section (pp. 374-435) ofthe Phun-sum-tshogs-pa rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas (Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, 1.209-470). See, inparticular, the remarks introducing that section, on p. 376: de-la Mdo dgongs-pa 'dus-pa lungthams-cad-kyi rtsa-ba yin . . . so-sor-'byed shes-par bya'o//\"The Mdo dgongs-pa 'dus-pa isthe root of all transmitted doctrines.

The origin of Klong-chen Rab-'byams-pa's renowned epithet may be the group ofRdzogs-chen tantras called Klong-chen rob- 'byams-kyi rgyud. Karma Pakshi, referring to these(Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, 1.453), attributes to them the \"ultimate view of the Great Perfection.\"91. E.g., Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, 1.27, 467, 637, etc.92. See, in particular, Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, II. 1-70, 235-453, the latter being whollydevoted to an exposition of the Gsar-ma tantras.93. Pakshi'i rang-rnam, p. 86.94. Chags-med ri-chos, 218b: \"Pakshi's intention was the coalescence of the new andancient [schools of the Vajrayana], and his ultimate intention was the coalescence of Mahamudraand of Rdzogs-pa chen-po.\" See, too, his Phyag-rdzogs-zung-'jug, p. 9: \"Karma Pakshi re-ceived the three cycles of the Mdo dgongs-pa 'dus-pa, Guhyagarbha, and Rdzogs-chen sems-sde (Mdo-sgyu-sems-gsum) from Byams-pa-'bum of Kah-thog, and he became learned inthem. Hence, his own doctrinal compositions concern the coalescence of Mahamudra andRdzogs-pa chenrpo.\"95. See, for example, Goldstein and Kapstein 1998, ch. 4, on the 'Bri-gung Bka'-brgyud.96. Two important works deserving attention in this regard are: Karma-pa VII Chos-gragsrgya-mtsho's Rigs-gzhung rgya-mtsho, vol. 1, p. 76ff., which preserves extracts from KarmaPakshi's now unavailable Tshad-ma rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas; and Karma-pa VIII Mi-bskyodrdo-rje's extraordinary commentary on Pakshi's Sku-gsum ngo-sprod precepts, the Sku-gsumrnam-bshad."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"246 Notes to Pages 105-10897. The canonical teachings of the Prajnaparamita Sutras and the Madhyamaka philoso-phy of Nagarjuna of course employ a wide range of skeptical arguments, though the mainlines of interpretation in Tibet sought to contextualize them so as to restrain the force of theirskepticism. Skeptical argument is sometimes employed in connection with the meditationalteachings of the Mahamudra and Rdzogs-chen, and this was sometimes castigated as a \"ni-hilist\" (chad-lta) tendency within these traditions. See, for instance, Takpo 1986, pp. 105-109; Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 896-910. A good example of the application of skeptical ar-gument in a contemplative context may be found in Takpo 1986, p. 184ff., where it is a questionof analytic meditation (dpyad-bsgom), systematically calling into question the assumptionsand attributions through which one conceptualizes the mind. The author comments that the\"meditator should therefore examine thoroughly with a persistence in the manner of an in-quisitive person crushing a bone with a stone!\"98. This section is based on my unpublished article \"A Golden Age of Understanding?Dol-po-pa on the Krtayuga and What Followed.\" In Stearns 1999, it is referred to as \"Kapstein1994.\"99. Several versions of Db'lpopa's biography have now become available. These haverecently been studied with great care in Stearns 1999, which work should be consulted bythose wishing to examine Dolpopa's life in depth. See also Kapstein 1992f.100. See n. 56 above, and Kapstein in press.101. This raises interesting questions concerning the possible relationships between 'Bri-gung Skyob-pa's distinctive dgongs-gcig (\"single intention\") doctrine and the Rdzogs-ldan-lugs (\"Krtayuga tradition\") of Dol-po-pa. One apparent affinity between them is noted below,n. 131. Both, of course, are castigated by their opponents as representatives of Hwa-shangIta-ba, \"the views of Heshang Moheyan.\"102.

Snellgrove 1957, 1967b, 1989; Jest 1974a, 1974b.104. Dol-po-pa's own biography of his master is found in Dol-po-pa, no. 60.105. The construction of the caitya is described in Kapstein 1992f, pp. 13-14; Stearns1999, ch. 1, pt. 4. For further background see Tucci 1949, p. 189ff., and Vitali 1990, pp. 126-133. Cabezon 1998, pp. 141-158, offers interesting suggestions concerning the relationshipbetween Tibetan religious thought and architecture.106. As A. W. Macdonald 1984b, p. 70, remarks of the Sherpa scholar Sangs-rgyas-bstan-'dzin (1924-1990), his biography \"shows us what can still be accomplished, even in thesedays, by a man of stubborn courage and solid faith.\"107. The fourteenth century, however, was a period of distinctive doctrinal synthesis.

This has been affirmed to me by many of the traditionally trained scholars I havequeried about the place of history in Tibetan scholasticism, including H. H. the Dalai Lama,when I interviewed him at his home in Dharamsala in the spring of 1993. Nevertheless, therehave always been some who have taken a special interest in this area. Among my own teachers,for instance, H. H. Dudjom Rinpoche and Ven. Dezhung Rinpoche particularly encouragedthe investigation of Tibetan historical writing, though this was never part of a formal scholasticcurriculum. Indeed, the inherent perennialism of Tibetan scholastic traditions militated stronglyagainst the independent value of historical research.115. Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, p. 959, exemplifies prevailing opinion when he writes: \"Al-though, in general, there have been many changes in the political life of Tibet during the past,as far as the doctrine is concerned, the veracity of the Teacher's own prophetic declarationthat his teaching would increasingly spread northwards has been actualised. Due to the meritsof those to be trained in Tibet, and by the power of the timely penetration of [the world by]the Conquerors' compassion, individuals who have held the teaching and have shown mas-tery in inconceivable careers of learning, dignity, and accomplishment, have successivelyappeared from the time of the teaching's inception in the past down to the present day. Be-cause they preserved the most precious teaching and continue to preserve it, the continuity ofthe doctrine in Tibet has never been impaired.\"116. This is perhaps best exemplified by the entire Bka'-brgyud gser-phreng—\"goldenrosary of the oral lineage\"—genre.

I use \"esotericism\" here in the specific sense in which contemporary philosophersof religion understand it, that is, as referring to the assertion of a philosophical doctrine orintuition that, while not explicitly represented throughout the corpus being interpreted, isnevertheless held by its proponents to be present as the implicit or concealed message unify-ing the whole as its deepest or ultimate significance. In this sense, efforts to identify, say,Advaita Vedanta as the teaching underlying all Hinduism are similarly esoteric.136. Dol-po-pa, nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13. The commentaries on the three Prajnaparamitado not offer word-by-word explanations, of course, but rather detailed summaries, with glosseson selected topics, that attempt to illustrate the manner in which the Abhisamayalamkara it-self functions as a commentary on these sutras.137.

Similarly, \"second\" (dvapara) is theThird World Age (\"twos\" in the dice game), while the worst and last is kali (\"craps\").

Taranatha does mention Avitarka (Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1980, p. 102) butonly characterizes him generally as a teacher of the Mahayana.160. Makransky 1997 now offers an excellent study of the main commentarial traditionson the Abhisamayalamkara, devoting particular attention to Haribhadra in chapter 10, and inchapter 12 taking up the question of Tsong-kha-pa's debt to Haribhadra and, hence, his im-portance to the later Dge-lugs-pa school.161. Examples include Buddhist works such as Bhavaviveka's Tarkajvala, and the Jnana-sarasamuccaya, attributed to Aryadeva, as well as Brahmanical texts like the Sarvasiddhan-tasamgraha, attributed to Sankara, and Sayana Madhava's Sarvadarsanasamgraha. Therecan be no doubt that, in India, Vasubandhu and Asanga were in fact widely associated with aform of idealism.162. Rorty 1984, p. 62.163. Rorty 1984, pp. 62-63.164. It must be said, however, that Sa-skya Pandita is remarkably restrained here. Thus,even in commenting on Santideva's (in)famous verse, \"the absolute is not within the scope ofintellect\" {buddher agocaras tattvam, Bodhicaryavatara, ch. 9, verse 2, cited in Sa-pan gsung-'bum, vol. l,p. 131), he remarks that \"this [refers to] the definiendum but not to the definiens\"('di mtshan gzhi yin gyi mtshan nyid ma yin no), which is to say that the skeptical view appar-ently articulated by Santideva in this passage bears upon the intellect's ability to refer di-rectly to the absolute, but not upon its ability so to refer indirectly, through a mediating concept.165. See nn. 64, 96.166. Kapstein 1992f; Stearns 1999.167. Hopkins 1999, p. 3, nicely describes the perspective that must characterize thought-ful interpretation of Tibetan religious discourse when he writes of his own fascination \"withwhat seemed to be a cacophony of perspectives within the tradition.\"168. O-rgyan glegs-bam, p. 489.169. This may also be a point of some importance for the assessment of Tibetan philo-sophical writings. The great Rnying-ma-pa master, 'Jam-mgon 'Ju Mi-pham Rin-po-che(1846-1912), for instance, was the author of a short treatise in defense of the \"extrinsic emp-tiness\" doctrine, Gzhan-stong khas-len. In interviewing scholars trained in differing branchesof Mi-pham's lineage, however, it became apparent that while some held this text to repre-sent Mi-pham's real view of the matter, others maintained that Mi-pham dictated the Gzhan-stong khas-len only as an exercise, in order to demonstrate the best case one might make infavor of a viewpoint that in the end would have to be abandoned.170. Gyatso 1998, pp. 116, 119.171. The best example of such a rare case is no doubt Ma-cig Lab-sgron (1055-1143).Several of the works attributed to her authorship are studied in Orofino 1987.172.

It is clear that during the fifteenth andsixteenth centuries, the contribution of the Sa-skya-pa, Jo-nang-pa, and Bka'-brgyud-pa, tothe ongoing development of Tibetan scholasticism remains a vital one, as is seen in the worksof masters such as Stag-tshang Lo-tsa-ba Shes-rab-rin-chen (b. 1405), Gser-mdog Pan-chenShakya mchog-ldan (1428-1507), Go-rams-pa Bsod-nams-seng-ge (1429-1489), Karma-paVII Chos-grags rgya-mtsho (1454-1506), Karma-pa VIII Mi-bskyod rdo-rje (1507-1554),Dwags-po Bkra-shis rnam-rgyal (1512-1587), 'Brug-chen IV Padma dkar-po (1527-1592),and Jo-nang Rje-btsun Taranatha (1575-1634). After the time of the latter, the creativity ofthe non-Dge-lugs-pa traditions in Central Tibet seems largely exhausted and picks up againonly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, primarily in far eastern Tibet. This is mostlikely explained by the impact on religious institutions of the struggles of the Dbus-Gtsangcivil war, the consolidation of power under the Fifth Dalai Lama, the subsequent state-sponsored promotion of the Dge-lugs-pa sect and restriction of their opponents, and, finally,the devastating effects of the early-eighteenth-century Dzungar invasions (on which seech. 7, n. 64). On the religious history of this period, refer to Smith 1968, 1970. We shouldnote, too, that even with the revival of non-Dge-lugs-pa scholasticism in eastern Tibet, thegeneral dominance of Dge-lugs-pa thought was often in evidence: see, for instance, Kapstein1997c on the nineteenth-century Jo-nang-pa master 'Ba'-mda' Dge-legs.Chapter 71. See now esp. Buswell 1989, 1990; Cabezon 1992; Collins 1990.2. For a useful introduction to the textual traditions called \"canon\" in recent BuddhistStudies, see Lancaster 1979. As for \"apocrypha,\" Lamotte, 1976, p. 180, referring to the pro-liferation of sutras prior to the actual emergence of the Mahayana, introduces the term asfollows: \"D'autre part a cote de sutra authentiques, dument classes dans les collections, ontcircule des textes separes (muktakd) et apocryphes (adhyaropita). ... La multiplicationdes textes apocryphes a conduit les anciens theoriciens du Dharma a formuler des criteresd'authenticite. ...\" Consider, too, Warder's remarks (1970, p. 354) on the formation of theMahayana literature itself: \"[C]ertain monks felt the need not simply for new interpretationsof the original sutras ... but for wholesale restatements of the doctrine. For this purpose theyrewrote the sutras, or wrote new sutras. ... It is a matter of speculation how far there wasdeliberate deception in this fabrication of new sutras.\"3. On the background of this popular text (no. 945 in the Taisho Tripitaka), refer toDemieville 1952, pp. 43-52, n. 3; Lamotte 1965, pp. 106-107. Neither writer hesitates torefer to this version of the Suramgama as \"un apocryphe chinois.\"4. Buttrick 1962, vol. 1, pp. 498^99; Hennecke and Schneemelcher 1963, vol. 1, p. 21.5. Cf.

We should note too that, following this definition, large portions of such hallowed col-lections as the Tibetan Tanjur will have to be regarded as being in some sense extracanonical.This, however, is as it should be, for only a few of the works and authors represented thereinare generally thought to be so exalted as to be accorded the authoritative status otherwisereserved for works described as buddhavacana. The commentaries, treatises, and literary worksmaking up the Tanjur and similar compilations are canons primarily in the sense in which wespeak of \"aesthetic canons\" or \"legal canons\"; that is, they provide the models and standardsfor the specific classes of endeavor that they represent and as such are considered to meritemulation. The degree to which they embody the Buddha's message, however, is subject todiscussion and debate and in some cases may be doubted altogether."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 122-125 2517.

There are, however, some exceptions to this, e.g., the \"genuine\" Chinese sutras whencontrasted with the \"spurious\" Chinese sutras, though both classes are agreed not to haveoriginated in Buddhist India. See Mizuno 1982, p. 116ff. (However, the dominant tendencyin China was certainly to regard the dichotomy of spurious and genuine as excluding anyintervening category; see Kyoku Tokuno, \"The Evaluation of Indigenous Scriptures in Chi-nese Buddhist Bibliographical Catalogues,\" in Buswell 1990, pp. 31-74.)

Cabezon 1992, p. 236, n. 4, takes issue with certain aspects of my discussion here,but I think that his remarks miss the point of this paragraph. My intention is only to empha-size that, when we use the term \"apocrypha\" to refer to concepts found within Buddhist dis-putes on scriptural authenticity, we are not using it in just the same way that we do in Jewishand Christian contexts, and that we need to be clear about the semantic shift that has takenplace. I am grateful, however, to Cabezon both for his generous comments about this chapter(as it appeared in Kapstein 1989a), and for his contribution to enlarging the scope of reflec-tion on its subject matter through his valuable examination of Vasubandhu's Vyakhydyukti.12.

As Davidson 1990 rightly points out, one Indian oral tradition, that of the Vedas, wastransmitted with verifiable precision. But in the absence of anything like the Vedic system ofchecks and balances, only an early written tradition could have avoided some of the difficul-ties faced by the Buddhists in ensuring the authority of their transmissions. For a fine exampleof the degree of accuracy that was attained in the transmission of some Indian folk traditions,see Grierson and Barnett 1920, pp. 3-4. While the evidence for exactitude here is impressiveindeed, we must not forget that the sayings of Lalla form a relatively small collection of versesand so cannot be the basis for a comparison with the extensive prose corpus of ancient Bud-dhism. Still, the mnemonic achievements of the early Buddhist bhanaka-s (\"reciters\") haveyet to be considered in detail.17. Cf. Collingwood 1956, pp. 25-26. There is little doubt that by the time the Buddhistsbegan to commit their scriptures to writing, the lives and teachings of the founder and hisoriginal circle of disciples were no longer within the range of scientific history as Collingwoodhere conceives of it.18.

In particular, the Dge-lugs-pas assessment of the Rnying-ma-pa traditions deserves a more subtle appraisal than ithas so far received. The fact is that the Dge-lugs-pa had no fixed party line with respect to theRnying-ma-pas, for as Sum-pa mkhan-po himself admits: \"So it is that although the ancientscholars and saints of Tibet extensively refuted [the Rnying-ma-pas,] the venerable Tsong-kha-pa, his sons, and others among the real Dge-ldan-pas [i.e., Dge-lugs-pas] did not refuteor deride them at all....\" (de Itar na bod kyi mkhas grub snga ma dag gis de Itar rgyas parbkag pa las rje tsong kha pa yah sras sags dge Idan pa dngos dag gis de la dgag smod gangyang by as pa med. .. .) Dpag-bsam Ijon-bzang, p. 399.33. This learned master's view of the Rnying-ma-pa and allied traditions is exceedinglycomplex. Sa-skya Pandita's foremost polemical work is his Sa-skya sdom-gsum, now trans-lated in Rhoton forthcoming. See also R. Jackson 1982; D. Jackson 1990,1994. What emergeshere is that Sa-skya Pandita sought to discredit a tradition that he calls Rgya-nag rdzogs-chen,the \"Chinese Great Perfection.\" As Karmay 1975a, p. 152ff., has shown, this was certainlynot the Great Perfection of the Rnying-ma-pa and Bon-po, but rather the Chan teaching at-tributed to Heshang Moheyan. Karmay's conclusion is further reinforced by the consider-ation that Sa-skya Pandita refers to his own study of the Rdzogs-chen of the \"Tibetan elders,\"without any disparagement, in his Nga-brgyad-ma'i 'grel-pa, in Sa-skya bka'-'bum, vol. 5,p. 151.2.3. Consider, too, Smith's remarks (1970, pp. 7-8) on Sa-skya Pandita and the Vajrakllatradition, which was something of a 'Khon family specialty. Finally, we should note that Sa-skya Pandita's nephew Chos-rgyal 'Phags-pa does not hesitate to enumerate the Rnying-matantras, without negative comment, in his Rgyud-sde 'i dkar-chag, in Sa-skya bha'- 'bum, vol. 7,pp. 136.3-138.2.6.34. On Rig-pa'i-ral-gri, see also ch. 5. The available evidence suggests that Rig-pa'i-ral-gri, while criticizing the Rnying-ma-pa in some respects, contributed substantially totheir defense: see, for instance, Sog-bzlog-pa , vol. 1, pp. 500-509, 524-526. The last pas-sage cited, part of a defense of the authenticity of the controversial Guhyagarbhatantra(T 832), is also given in Bdud-'joms chos-'byung, pp. 765.6-768.6; trans. Dudjom 1991,vol. 1, pp. 914-916. It has recently emerged that Thar-pa Lo-tsa-ba's translation of theGuhyagarbha, which was commissioned by Rig-pa'-ral-gri, has been preserved as no. 754of the Phug-brag Bka'-'gyur manuscript kept at the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives,Dharamsala.35. Aspects of Bu-ston's contributions to the canonicity debates are discussed in BA,p. 417, n. 4; Ruegg 1969, pp. 21-35, esp. p. 27, n. 1., pp. 28-30, n. 1. The Sngags-log sun-'byin, noted by Ruegg as having been attributed to Bu-ston by Klong-rdol bla-ma and con-sidered to be of questionable authenticity by Sum-pa mkhan-po, has been published in Indiain a small photo-offset po-ti (n.d., n.p.). Doubts about its attribution to Bu-ston are increasedby the considerations that Sog-bzlog-pa nowhere mentions it, and by the tract's own charac-ter, which is that of a diatribe rather than of a well-reasoned argument. Thu 'u-bkwan grub-"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"254 Notes to Page 128mtha', p. 74, describes it as follows: \"Though it is seemingly authored by Bu-ston, it doesnot appear in the catalogues of his Gsung- 'bum, and if one examines its style, there is noexperience of its being the work of a scholar. So, it was merely written by some fool andpassed off as Bu-ston Rin-po-che's.\" (bu ston gyis mdzad pa yin khul zhig 'dug pa/ gsung'bum gyi dkar chag mams su mi snang zhing/ tshig sbyor la dpags kyang mkhaspa'i gsunggi nyams mi 'dug pas/ blun po zhig gis bris nas bu ston rin po che la khag yar bar zad do//)36. His main polemical work appears to have been Klong-chen brgal-lan, though theauthorship of this is uncertain. However, related comments are also found inter alia in Klong-chen rgyud-sde spyi-don, the attribution of which is reliable.37. This master, himself a discoverer of spiritual treasures (gter-ston), authored a detaileddefense of the ancient tantras published as Rat-gling rtsod-bzlog.38. See Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, p. 917.39. See Karmay 1975a, p. 152.40. The eighth Karma-pa is famed for having written a furious attack on the Rnying-ma-pa, which, not being satisfactorily refuted by any of the adherents of that sect, he then pro-ceeded to refute himself. The texts are quoted in detail in Sog-bzlog-pa, vol. 2, pp. 1-143.41. Sog-bzlog-pa, vol. 1, pp. 261-601; vol. 2, pp. 1-143, 213-241. These works are ofparticular importance for the documentation they provide of the entire course of the debatefrom the late tenth century down to the author's own age.42. An excellent example of this, which devotes much attention to the question of scrip-tural authenticity, is chapter 7 ofBdud-'joms chos-'byung; trans. Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, book 2,pt. 7.43. There has been a great deal of sectarian dispute among Tibetan refugees in India. Muchof this has its roots in the works of Pha-bong-kha-pa Bde-chen snying-po (1878-1937), whosevisions of the Dge-lugs-pa protective deity Rdo-rje shugs-ldan seem to have entailed a com-mitment to oppose actively the other schools of Tibetan Buddhism and the Bon-po. While thestatus of the protective deity was the ostensive topic of debate initially, all aspects of sectar-ian rivalry have since been brought into play. The first cannonade was the Dge-lugs-pa par-tisan Dze-smad sprul-sku's Bstan-srung byung-brjod. This was answered, on behalf of theother sects, in T. G. Dhongthog's Dus-kyi sbrang-char. The Dge-lugs-pa response came notfrom Dze-smad, but from a disciple: Yon-tan-rgya-mtsho's Gdong-lan. At least two counter-attacks then appeared: T. G. Dhongthog's Dus-kyi me-lce, and Bya-bral Sangs-rgyas-rdo-rje'sRdo-rje me-char. Yon-tan-rgya-mtsho responded in turn with his Brgal-lan kun-khyab 'brug-sgra. While these disputes were unfolding, H. H. the Dalai Lama disavowed the opinions ofDze-smad and his followers in a privately distributed mimeographed statement, publishedlater by the government of Bhutan: Skyabs-mgon bka'-slob. The Tibetan government in exilein Dharamsala has also published a statement of the Dalai Lama's official position on thesematters, Dol-rgyal-skor gsal-bshad, and a collection of his pertinent speeches, Chos-skyongbka '-slob. For a more general introduction to the controversial opinions of Pha-bong-kha-pa,as presented by his immediate disciples, see Pha-bong-kha-pa.The Dge-lugs-pa sect, both in India and Tibet, has become deeply fissured over the Shugs-ldan issue. During the past several years, the dispute has also become an international causecelebre, particularly following the gruesome slaying in February 1997 of the principal of theBuddhist dialectical college in Dharamsala, a crime that has been widely blamed on adher-ents of the Shugs-ldan cult. The controversy has as a result been widely discussed in the press,and on several websites. In November 1997, a special panel was convened to discuss it at theannual meeting of the American Academy of Religion. These developments are convenientlyand accurately surveyed in Lopez 1998, pp. 188-196. See now also Dreyfus 1998.44. On Tominaga Nakamoto and his contributions in this context, see Mizuno 1982,pp. 125-128.

The colophon (906.6-7) actually says it was his eightieth, but this is an erroneouscalculation, as has been indicated by Vostrikov 1970, p. 56, n. 168.46. Nor-bu ketaka, 906.7.

His famous Thu'u-bkwan grub-mtha' evidences the extraordinary range of his inter-ests. More important, however, is the relative impartiality he was able to achieve, despite thefact that he was no doubt limited with respect to his sources for schools other than the Dge-lugs-pa. In this, his work certainly is superior to Sum-pa's Dpag-bsam Ijon-bzang. The Thu'u-bkwan grub-mtha', however, does contain one notable accusation directed against the Rnying-ma-pas: Thu'u-bkwan declares that, for all intents and purposes, the ancient oral tradition(bka'-ma) of the Rnying-ma-pas has become a dead lineage. Bdud-'joms chos-'byung,pp. 502.3-503.2, trans. Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 735-736, suggests that this passage was aninterpolation in Thu'u-bkwan's text, a possibility here owing to the fact that the work wasonly published posthumously and so may have suffered at the hands of Thu'u-bkwan'sexecutors. However, Rev. Snyi-shul mkhan-po, a leading Rnying-ma-pa scholar from Khams,has kindly informed me that oral tradition in far eastern Tibet considers Thu'u-bkwan's re-marks to reflect accurately the state of affairs existing among the Rnying-ma-pa laity of Amdoduring his own day and age. Thorough study of the sources mentioned in the two notes fol-lowing may eventually contribute to some clarification here."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"256 Notes to Pages 129-13061. See, for example, Zhabs-dkar's O-rgyan glegs-bam, pp. 435.2-439.1, where the en-tire passage translated later (pp. 132-134) is given and attributed to Chos-kyi-rdo-rje's Nor-buketaka'i byi-dor. As an Amdo Rnying-ma-pa with a Dge-lugs-pa education writing a tractintended to promote intersectarian understanding, it is most unlikely that Zhabs-dkar wouldhave cited the work of an extremely popular local master if that work were suspected ofbeing forged. Oral reports circulating in some sectarian circles when I lived in India and Nepalduring the early 1970s accused the then head of the Nyingmapa sect, H. H. Bdud-'joms Rin-po-che (1904-1987), of having manufactured the text, but given Zhabs-dkar's references toit during the early nineteenth century this was clearly a ludicrous charge.62. The great 'Jam-dbyangs Mkhyen-brtse'i dbang-po (1820-1892) is quite forthrightabout this. See 'Jam-dbyangs Mkhyen-brtse, p. 45.1-2. The late Rev. Mgon-po Tshe-brten, awell-known Rnying-ma-pa master from Amdo, moreover communicated to me that the fourth' Jam-dbyangs-bzhad-pa'i-rdo-rje, the first two Lcang-skya hierarchs, and the first two Thu'u-bkwan hierarchs are all remembered as protectors of the Rnying-ma-pas in Amdo. Finally,we should recall that Thu'u-bkwan's own preferred tutelary deity (yi-dam) was a form ofHayagffva whose rites belong to the Rnying-ma tradition: see Thu 'u-bkwan gsung- 'bum,vols. 6-7, Rta-pod.63. Petech 1972, pp. 34, 136-137.64. On these events in general, see Petech 1972, pp. 32-65. Note, in particular, the fol-lowing remarks, on pp. 53-54: \"The general policy that lay at the background of these raidswas inspired by the sGo-mans Bla-ma Blo-bzan-p'un-tshogs; it was a clear-cut programmeof persecution of the rNin-ma-pa school of Lamaism. Religious persecution was till then littleknown in Tibet; the struggle between Reds and Yellows had been of a purely political nature.Now these strangers from the north-west, more Lamaist than the lamas, imported intoTibet a full-dress religious intolerence and persecution. All the images, statues, and books ofPadmasambhava were burnt. The monasteries of rNam-rgyal-glin and bSam-ldih were stormed,sMin-grol-glin was attacked, all of them rNin-ma-pa centres. The main centre of that sect,rDo-rje-brag, suffered the same fate; and its incarnate, the Bla-c'en, was killed.... Even theBon-po sanctuary of Ri-rgyal gSen-dar was pillaged.\"65. It must be noted, however, that Sum-pa mkhan-po had a great reputation for uphold-ing the letter of Buddhist monastic discipline, whatever his political opinions may have been.Thus, he is known to have restrained those monks under his authority who sought to take partin military conflict.66. For Sum-pa mkhan-po's own account of the Dzungar invasions, see Yang 1969,pp. 22-23 (text) and 45-47 (translation). Sum-pa mkhan-po blames Lha-bzang Khan, whomthe Dzungars deposed, for having secretly placed his faith in rnying-chos, which Yang liter-ally but incorrectly translates as \"old religion.\" Actually, the phrase means here \"the doctrineof the Rnying-ma-pas.\"67. He did, however, study in Central Tibet, at Sgo-mang Grwa-tshang and elsewhere,while in his early twenties.68. Petech 1959 would want us to include Sum-pa among them without qualification, but,as my remarks here make clear, I cannot accept this assessment. On p. xv, he writes: \"Sum-pamK'an-po was a typical representative of that group of Mongol churchmen who threw in theirlot wholeheartedly with China and linked their fortunes with those of the Manchu dynasty.\"On Tibetan religious relations with the Qing rulers, see now Rawski 1998.69.

Thu'u-bkwan, rather than referring directly to Sum-pa's main attack on gter-ma, citedhere earlier, refers instead to a final summary statement: Nor-bu ketaka, 905. 3-4.88.

Sum-pa himself affirms its authenticity in Nor-bu ketaka, 889.3. The appearance ofthis text in ancient times is traditionally held to mark the inception of Buddhism's presencein Tibet. See Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 508-509. Ironically, once more, the text in question isa Chinese apocryphon.90. There may be some equivocation here: in denouncing \"celestial doctrines\" (gnam-chos), Sum-pa mkhan-po was probably referring not to texts said to have fallen physicallyfrom heaven, but rather to the popular gter-ma traditions known by this name, which wererevealed by Gnam-chos Mi-'gyur-rdo-rje during the mid-seventeenth century and redactedby Karma Chags-med (ca. 1600-1666).91.

Interestingly, the concept of the presence of the Dharma in nature,which appears to be involved here, has become a central matter of contestation in the recentJapanese \"Critical Buddhism\" discussions; see now Hubbard and Swanson 1997, in particu-lar pt. 3.

Ketaka'i byi-dor, pp. 16-21.110. We should not, of course, expect to find Western debates that are exactly similar tothe Tibetan discussions of scripture. A few examples may be useful in order to indicate justwhat sorts of parallel are to be found. Recalling the argument from consensus found in thepassage from Vasubandhu cited in n. 15 above, we may consider the following, from the Jewishpolemical work Nizzahon Vetus: \"One can also point out that 'a matter is established by twowitnesses' (Deut. 19:15), and there are two witnesses for our Torah since both you and theIshmaelites admit that our Torah is true. However, neither we nor the Ishmaelites admit tothe truth of your Torah, and neither we nor you admit to the truth of the Torah of the Ishmaelites.Consequently, there are two witnesses that our Torah is true and that our God is true and eter-nal\" (Berger 1979, p. 203). Regarding the development of normative doctrinal criteria forscriptural authenticity, a good illustration is found in Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786), hererepresenting a line of thought that can be traced back to the Jewish Averroists of Muslim Spain:\"I make the following fundamental distinction between the books of the Old and New Testa-ments: the former are in harmony with my philosophical views, or at least do not contradictthem, while the latter demand a faith I cannot profess\" (Lasker, 1977, p. 38). The tendency toexclude, on a priori grounds, the types of revelation characteristic of the scriptures of one'sopponents is nicely exemplified by the Byzantine polemicist Barthelemy of Edessa: \"Nous,nous ne recevons pas I'Ecriture de gens pris de sommeil. Car nul homme doue de sens etmaitre de sa raison ne neglige ses yeux sensibles et sa connaissance pour admettre les imagi-nations de ceux qui dorment. Ce n'est pas a des hommes endormis que Dieu demande vertuou bon jugement. Dieu en effet n'est pas le Dieu de ceux qui dorment mais de ceux qui sonteveilles\" (Khoury 1972, p. 214). For further examples from the Latin West and from Islamicauthors, see Sweetman 1955, pt. 2, vol. 1, ch. 5.111. In addition to Sweetman 1955, refer to Rescher 1967, ch. 9, and Southern 1962,pp. 92-94. The crucial comparison is to be made between Sum-pa's point-by-point critiqueof the texts in the Gzungs-'dus and Nicholas's historical approach, which is described bySouthern.112. Accounts and discussions of the gter-ma traditions include Aris 1989; Dudjom 1991,vol. 1, book 2, pt. 7; Germano in Goldstein and Kapstein 1998; Germano forthcoming; Gyatso1986, 1993, 1994, 1998; Padma Tshewang et al. 1995; and Thondup Rinpoche 1986. Lopez1998, p. 243, n. 32, remarks that \"Western scholars of Tibetan Buddhism have been reluctant todirectly confront the question of the historical legitimacy of gter ma, to consider the rediscoveredtexts as, in fact, works composed by their discoverers and hidden only to be revealed.... Thefact that the pious fiction of authenticity has been tacitly maintained for so long by scholars ofTibet is itself a fascinating topic to be considered with the larger issue of mystification.\"One important feature of the traditional discourse on gter-ma that has unfortunately beentoo often lost sight of is the tradition's insistence on the bibliographical attribution of thegter-ma to their discoverers; I have never seen a Tibetan catalogue (dkar-chag) or record ofteachings (gsan-yig) that simply lumps the gter-ma together under their eponymous authors.Thus, for instance, the great nineteenth-century anthology of gter-ma, the Rin-chen gter-mdzodchen-mo, is arranged within each of its sections according to the historical progression oftreasure-discoverers. What must be recalled, therefore, is that the tradition itself tacitly at-tributes the extant literary form of the gter-ma to the discoverer, and not to the \"author.\"113.

Collins 1998, pp. 121-133, introduces and clarifies this dichotomy in connection withthe conception of nirvana in the Pali tradition.2. The classicist Arthur Adkins (1990), for instance, has suggested that we study, in thecontext of Greek thought, not the relationship between mythos and philosophia, but ratherthe relationship between mythos and logos within philosophia. Lawrence J. Hatab (1990,p. 293), also referring to classical philosophy, concludes: \"[T]he idea of rationality versusmyth is both misleading and at times simply wrong because rationality and myth can over-lap. .. . [RJationality and myth have coexisted, can coexist and, I would suggest, shouldcoexist.\" (Emphasis in original).3. Refer to Dundes 1984 for useful surveys of the leading attempts to define \"myth,\"particularly in relation to the categories of \"legend\" and \"folktale,\" and for general biblio-graphical background. For more recent work in this area, see especially Lincoln 1989, pt. 1.4. In this context, readers may wish to reflect on the so-called Gaia-hypothesis of theBritish chemist James Lovelock, which regards our planet as forming a single organic sys-tem. In a popular review of scientific work on Gaia, The Economist, vol. 317, no. 7686/7687(December 22,1990), 107, commented that \"the strongest resistance to Gaia comes from thosewhose faith is grounded in another metaphor—'natural selection.' Nature is not a goddesswho chooses, as Darwin knew full well. But the metaphor of choice was the best way to ex-press his views.... Darwin's metaphor provided a great insight into the workings of the world.If Gaia manages to do the same—something which looks unlikely at present, but not impos-sible—then the objections to Dr Lovelock's metaphor will be forgotten, too.\" (Emphasisadded.)5. Slusser 1982, vol. 1, pp. 364-365.6. See, in particular, \"Pragmatism's Conception of Truth\" and \"The Will to Believe,\"both in James 1948.7. Refer to ch. 4, n. 17, and ch. 7, n. 43. My remarks in the following paragraph arebased upon my own observations and conversations with regard to the Rdo-rje Shugs-ldandispute in recent years.8. Besides these examples, consider Daniel 1990, where the topic investigated is the vir-tually ubiquitous presence of myth in early modern philosophy. Daniel's work develops aconception of \"myth\" essentially similar to that which I am exploring here. In his introduc-tion, p. 3, he writes, \"What I mean by myth is a particular mode or group of functions, opera-tive within discourse, that highlight how communication and even thought are themselvespossible. Certain functions of discourse are mythic insofar as they reveal how discourse itselfis possible.\"9. In this chapter I have used the published facsimile edition of the Punakha version ofthe Mani bka'- 'bum. The blocks for this edition were apparently carved at the request of acertain Mnga'-ris sgrub-chen Ngag-dbang chos-'phel, the disciple of Ngag-dbang bstan-'dzinrab-rgyas (Mani bka'- 'bum, II. 708). Dr. Michael Aris kindly informed me that while the formerremains unidentified, \"his master .. . was the fourth 'Brug-sDe-srid (regn. 1680-1695, lived1638-1696). He was the first in the line of the Khri-sprul or Bla-ma khri-pa (of which therehave been six).

The Punakha edition is based on an earlieredition from Gung-thang in Mnga'-ris (Mani bka'-'bum, II. 617), an example of which ispreserved in the National Archives of Nepal.

The basic structure of the Mani bka'-'bum is revealed in its dkar-chag (Mani bka'-'bum I. 9-23). It seems that this dkar-chag is of some antiquity and is identical to the Yer-pa'i dkar-chag referred to by Mani bka'-'bum's editors (I. 19, mchari). A similar dkar-chagserved as the basis for the Fifth Dalai Lama's discussion of the contents of the Mani bka'-'bum: Lnga-pa'i gsan-yig, vol. 3, plates 130-153. Lnga-pa'i gsan-yig's discussion is, for allintents and purposes, a detailed commentary on the dkar-chag and reflects the Dalai Lama'sgreat personal interest in the Mani bka'-'bum. It is noteworthy that at least one group of textslisted in the dkar-chag that was not available to the redactors of the Mani bka'-'bum (II. 616-617) could not be located by the Great Fifth either (Lnga-pa 'i gsan-yig, 149). The Dalai Lamaalso mentions one group of texts (Lnga-pa'i gsan-yig, 139-140) that are not to be found inthe dkar-chag but seem to have been in circulation in connection with the Mani bka'- 'bum.For useful summaries of the Mani bka'-'bum's contents see also Vostrikov 1970, pp. 53-55;Ariane Macdonald 1968/69, pp. 527-528.17. In Mani bka'- 'bum, it forms a separate cycle (II. 619-711), where it is entitled 'Phags-pa nam-mkha'i rgyal-po'i mngon-rtogs sags phran 'ga'. The title Gab-pa mngon-phyung giskor is given in the dkar-chag (I. 22).18. See esp.

As van der Kuijp 1994 shows, however, SakyaSfl's arrival in Tibet in 1204 cor-responds to the consecration of Nyang-ral's memorial stupa, and not to his death. The dates1124-1192 are therefore to be preferred.25. Lnga-pa'i gsan-yig, vol. 3, p. 130. This is a restatement of part of the dkar-chag (Manibka'-'bum, I. 21-22). It is of interest to note that some of the masters mentioned in connec-tion with the compilations of the Mani bka'-'bum are also mentioned in connection with thecult of the Lhasa Jo-khang. See Lha-ldan dkar-chag, pp. 78-79.26. Blondeau 1984, p. 81, rightly emphasizes the uncertainty with which the Fifth DalaiLama proposes this.27. Lnga-pa'i gsan-yig, vol. 3, p. 131.28.

See Gter-ston brgya-rtsa, pp. 371-372; Dudjom 1991, vol. 1,p. 758. Nyang-ral, p. 501, summarizes the gter-ma discoveries, possibly including those form-ing the early portions of the Mani bka'-'bum.31. Lnga-pa'i gsan-yig, vol. 3, p. 151, notes that he was a bhiksu. It appears that the FifthDalai Lama had access to some specific information about the lesser known figures in theMani bka'-'bum's lineage.32. Mani bka'-'bum, II. 651.33. It should be noted that the dkar-chag seems not to have originally listed any of Shakya-'od's discoveries, but that the account of them forms an appended discussion (Mani bka'-'bum I. 22). Perhaps the \"original\" Mani bka'-'bum consisted solely of the discoveries ofDngos-grub and Mnga'-bdag Nyang, as assembled by the latter or one of his school.34. Compare, for instance, Shes-bya kun-khyab, vol. 1, p. 433.35. lha'i sgrub-thabs.36. zhal-gdams kyi rtsa-ba-rnams.37. 'Phags-pa Spyan-ras-gzigs-kyi bka' dngos.38. pha-chos rnying-ma.39. Taranatha, Khrid-brgya'i brgyud-pa'i lo-rgyus, in Gdams-ngag-mdzod, vol. 12,pp. 356-357.40. Among gter-ma, the Mani bka'-'bum is peculiar with respect to its punctuation: itmakes use of the ordinary shad, instead of the visarga-like gter-shad. It is of interest to com-pare, too, Taranatha's mild suggestion that the treasure-discoverers composed, rather thanfound, some parts of the Mani bka'-'bum with Sum-pa Mkhan-po Ye-shes dpal-'byor's vo-ciferous remarks (Vostrikov 1970, pp. 56-57). Cf. ch. 7 here, p. 132.41. This is confirmed, for instance, by the Central Tibetan Lnga-pa'i gsan-yig, the Bhu-tanese Mani bka'-'bum, and the many references found throughout Phyag-rdzogs-zung-'jug.Karma Chags-med, the author of the latter, who hailed from Nang-chen in Khams, was ac-tive during the first half of the seventeenth century.The exact meaning of the title Mani bka'-'bum is somewhat problematic; see Vostrikov1970, pp. 52-53 and Ariane Macdonald 1968/69, p. 527. The biographies of Guru Chos-kyidbang-phyug (1212-1270) were perhaps the first works to use this title and may provide thekey to its precise interpretation. My own rendering is similar to that of A.-M. Macdonald:\"The Collected Works (Bka'- 'bum) of King Srong-btsan sgam-po Concerning the Six-Syllable Mantra (Om Manipadme Hum).\"42.

These issues are taken up at length in Ariane Macdonald 1971 and Imaeda 1979. Seealso Blondeau 1970; Stein 1986a; and ch. 4 of the present book. There is considerable evi-dence for the Avalokitesvara cult in the banner paintings and murals of Dunhuang, but it isdifficult to interpret with certainty the ramifications for Tibet. In at least one instance, anexquisite mandala of Avalokitesvara in the form of Amoghapasa preserved at the MuseeGuimet (MG 26466, reproduced in Gies and Cohen 1995, cat. no. 283), one is tempted tospeculate upon a Tibetan connection, although there is unfortunately no evidence linking itpositively with Tibet. More telling, perhaps, is Dunhuang cave 14, where Avalokitesvara inhis various forms is the figure emphasized, but where this is clearly due to work that post-dates the period of Tibetan occupation. The mural that remains from the Tibetan period is ofVairocana, with whom, as I have argued earlier (ch. 4), Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan and his suc-cessors were personally identified. I am inclined to hold that the post-eleventh-centuryAvalokitesvara cult drew some of its inspiration from the earlier Vairocana cult and absorbedaspects of it, so that there may be a certain poetic justice in the transformation of Dunhuangcave 14.50. Lalou 1953. Texts related to the Avalokitesvara cult that are listed here include num-bers 79, 114, 157, 316, 343, 347, 352, 366, 388, 410, 440, 459, 460.51. My remarks on the Rnying-ma Bka'-ma are based on conversations with the lateH. H. Bdud-'joms Rin-po-che and with Rev. Mkhan-po Thub-bstan. Avalokitesvara is oneof the eight bodhisattvas in the mandalas of the Sgyu- 'phrul zhi-khro, which is associatedwith the Guhyagarbhatantra, and in the inflatory cycle of the Mdo dgongs-pa 'dus-pa, theforemost Anuyoga-tantra. In the latter he is also found, with Manjusri and Vajrapani, as oneof the Lords of the Three Clans (rigs-gsum mgon-po). Avalokitesvara's wrathful aspect,Hayagrlva, occupies a position of great importance in the Bka '-ma tradition, particularly inthe Bka'-brgyad cycle. When I state that the Bka'-ma includes \"authentically ancient mate-rial,\" I do so with the understanding that the many threads that are woven together there can-not at present be satisfactorily sorted out. The history of the Bka '-ma as seen from a tradi-tional standpoint is recounted in Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, book 2, pt. 5.52. Shes-bya kun-khyab, vol. 1, p. 433.

Their lineages and precepts have been master-fully summarized by Jo-nang Rje-btsun Kun-dga' grol-mchog: Gdams-ngag-mdzod, vol. 12,pp. 252, 256-257, 394-395, 430^32.54.

TheThugs-rje chen-po rgyal-ba rgya-mtsho introduced by Ras-chung-pa became particularly popularamong the Rnying-ma-pas, and above all among the Karma Bka'-brgyud-pas, whose hierarchsadopted it as their yi-dam. There is also a tradition of the Thugs-rje chen-po rgyal-ba rgya-mtsho that is traced back to Mitrayogin and is at present a specialty of the Dge-lugs-pa.55. Phyag-rdzogs zung-'jug, p. 265. Compare the tale of La-stod Dmar-po, given in BA,pp. 1026-1029, who on requesting teachings in India, probably during the late eleventhcentury, the very period with which we are here concerned, receives the six-syllable mantrafrom the master Rdo-rje-gdan-pa and then thinks to himself, \"This mantra is repeated through-out Tibet by all old men, women, and even children. This doctrine seems to be a commonone.\" A relatively early Bka'-gdams-pa text, Bka'-gdams pha-chos, p. 626, also insists thatAvalokitesvara \"certainly is the divine portion of Tibet\" (bod-kyi lha-skal-nyid-du nges).56.

Having at one time or another attended discourses on Avalokitesvara given by rep-resentatives of all the major Tibetan Buddhist traditions, I cannot but observe that the unify-ing features of this cult are far more apparent than the distinguishing features of the variouslineages involved. It would seem that this unity of the cult is what moved 'Gos Lo-tsa-ba togive it separate treatment in BA, pp. 1006-1046, Kong-sprul to anthologize it separately inGdams-ngag-mdzod, vol. 11, and Karma Chags-med to combine freely precepts from its dif-ferent lineages in his Phyag-rdzogs zung- 'jug.93. Kunsang 1990, 1993, translates selections from Nyang-ral's gter-ma-s relating toPadmasambhava. Though Gu-ru Chos-dbang is not known to have discovered a biography orhistorical record along these lines, his liturgical cycle, the Bla-ma-gsang- 'dus, was undoubtablyamong the most influential of the early rites for the worship of the precious master.94. Bischoff 1978 surveys some of the grounds for doubt here.95. Paul 1982, p. 81, thus rightly remarks that \"Guru Rimpoche ... in many ways, is tobe understood as the 'king' of the Sherpas, in that he plays, in a divine, symbolic way, thesame ritual role that kings often play in providing the 'center' for a social-cultural system.\"96. See ch. 1, nn, 61-62.97. On this (possibly mythical) tantra, see Mayer 1996, p. 66, n. 1.98. Sba-bzhed, p. 32. According to the remarks of Pa-sangs-dbang-'dus and HildegardDiemberger, dBa'-bzhed (ch. 2, n. 15), pp. 54-59, Padmasambhava's role is apparently eventhinner than this.99. Sba-bzhed, p. 81.100. Above all, the Zangs-gling-ma, translated in Kunsang 1993.101. This is demonstrated by the commentary of the eleveneth-century master Rong-zom-pa, in Rong-zom gsung-btus.102. Refer to Eastman 1983.103. On the Tibetan cult of Vajraklla and its literature, see now in particular Boord 1993;Mayer 1996. Traditional accounts of some of the major Vajraklla lineages are given in Dudjom1991, vol. 1, pp. 710-716. See also the more detailed Dpal rdo-rje-phur-pa'i lo-rgyus in Sog-bzlog-pa, vol. 1, pp. 111-201.104. The history of the early Phur-pa tradition within the 'Khon family is summarized inSa-skya'i gdung-rabs, pp. 14-15.105. This small and highly interesting text was first noticed by M. Lalou and was lateredited and translated by Bischoff and Hartman 1971.1 have interpreted the text somewhatdifferently than they have in a number of places.106. The manuscript does include a marginal annotation specifying a tiger year, but it isnot possible even to guess with which tiger year during the ninth and tenth centuries this maycorrespond.107. In this and the following paragraph, for the convenience of nonspecialist readers, Ihave transcribed the personal and place names as pronounced, where possible using theircurrent forms and not those of PT 44 itself. The orthography as given in the manuscript isnoted in the index.108. PT 44, lb-12b.109. Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, p. 472.110. Thus, the modern account of Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, p. 481, includes a reference to\"four female earth spirits,\" surely a recollection of the fourfold Use goddess. The porterageof the texts is recounted on p. 472. The narration of the occult powers realized by the adepts(p. 714), though mentioning different persons by name, is striking in its overall similarity tothe account found in PT 44: \"By brandishing the kila at a brushfire in a sandalwood forest,the great master Padmasambhava restored the forest. By brandishing it at the flooding waters"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"266 Notes to Pages 159-163of the Ganges, Vimalamitra fixed the river's course. By brandishing it at Mount TrakarKongcen, the Newar Silamanju made the rock face crumble to pieces. By thrusting it at thetracks of a wolf, the venerable lady Kharcenza caused the wolf to be swept away in an ava-lanche. By raising it against the crow which had carried off his rosary, Menu Gyelwei Nyingpomade the bird fall to earth. And by inflicting it upon the yak-hair tents of the Mo'n army, LoPelgi Lodro overpowered them. In these and other instances, these masters, thrusting the kilaat both enemies and obstacles, were invincible, even in the face of powerful magic.\" Finally,the mention of Padmasambhava' s scattering of gold, an important motif in tales of great tantricmasters, is usually associated with his first entry into Tibet, as it is in Dudjom 1991, vol. 1,p. 513. On this theme see also Kapstein 1992b, n. 19.111. See n. 98 in this chapter.112. Thus Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 710-712, enumerates seven lineages specializing inVajraklla, of which at least five must have been active at around the beginning of the elev-enth century, and this list is certainly not exhaustive.113. A caveat is required here, for the Padmasambhava cult, while celebrating the mon-arch Khri Srong-lde'u-btsan also diminishes him by emphatically depicting him as perform-ing obeisance before Padmasambhava. The cult is also frequently at odds with the old minis-terial clans, so that its allegiance to the imperial hierarchy is partial at most. The traditionssurrounding Srong-btsan-sgam-po seem overall to affirm the imperial order with less reser-vation, and to treat the ministers as the ruler's disciples and confidants.114. Ba-dzra-gu-ru 'i phan-yon, attributed to the discovery of Karma-gling-pa, mid-four-teenth century. Assuming that this dating is approximately correct, the text is of great interestfor, among other things, its protest against the current situation in China, Tibet, and Mongolia,and the deleterious effects of this on Tibet.115. Om Ah Hum Vajraguru Padmasiddhi Hum!116. From the gter-ma of Ratna-gling-pa, cited in Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, p. 744.117. Cf. the remarks of Ortner 1989, pp. 33-35, on \"egalitarianism and hierarchy: thecore contradiction\" in Sherpa society. See also Samuel 1993, pp. 123-125, on \"horizontalrelationships\" even within Central Tibet. Of course, I do not mean to suggest that there wasan absence of hierarchy on the Tibetan periphery, only that in many instances hierarchy seemsto have been more fluid in these regions than in the center.118. For the example of the authority and prestige accruing to a contemporary gter-ston,see Germano in Goldstein and Kapstein 1998. Mkhan-po 'Jigs-phun, the subject of Germano'sstudy, is, however, a rare example of a gter-ston who has chosen to remain a monk. But evenin this case, some element of the aggrandizement of family power may be seen, for the com-munity of nuns associated with his monastic settlement is directed by a niece who has nowherself been recognized as an incarnation.119. Aris 1989, pp. 105-106.120. Refer to Karmay 1988b, and Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 683-684, 821-824, for aglimpse of the Great Fifth's Rnying-ma-pa persona. Throughout the enormous historical andbiographical corpus produced by the Fifth and by his spiritual son and regent, Sde-srid Sangs-rgyas-rgya-mtsho, one is struck, too, by the abundant use of prophetic passages culled fromthe entire range of the gter-ma literature in elaborating the ideological justification of the GreatFifth's rule. It is clear that these figures understood very well the enduring authority of thosewho channeled the voices of the empire.Chapter 91. Aspects of the development of the Buddhist tantric Rudra myth have now been mas-terfully discussed in Davidson 1991 and Stein 1995. See now also Mayer 1998.

For an extended example of the traditional polemic concerning authenticity, seeDudjom 1991, vol. 1, book 2, pt. 7.3. Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, book 2, pt. 2.4. See, for instance, Karma Pakshi's Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, vol. 1, p. 402. Nonethe-less, Karma Pakshi, like both Mun-pa'i go-cha, which work he is probably following, andDgongs- 'dus 'grel-chen, is primarily interested in the symbolic dimensions of the Rudra tale.5. Bstan-srung rnam-thar, pp. 4-30. He is concerned here with the variant Buddhist tantricforms of the story of the defeat of Mahadeva (3iva) by the Buddha or members of the Buddha'sretinue, which is clearly the antecedent of the Rudra episode. For a very influential version ofthe story that is clearly related to that of Rudra, refer to Snellgrove 1987, pp. 134-141.6. For the general background of Tibetan history during this period, refer to Shakabpa1967, ch. 4-5; Petech 1990; van der Kuijp 1991.7. This is particularly evident in the writings of Nyang-ral Nyi-ma 'od-zer (1124-1196)and his associates, on which see esp. Ruegg 1989, pp. 74-92; Kunsang 1990, 1993; Dudjom1991, pp. 755-759; ch. 8 in this book.8. On the life and background of Klong-chen-pa, see Guenther 1975-1976, vol. 1,pp. xiii-xxv; Thondup 1989, pp. 145-188; Dudjom 1991, pp. 575-596. All of these accountsmay be traced back to the biography authored by Klong-chen-pa's disciple Chos-grags bzang-po. A critical interpretation will be found in Germano forthcoming.9. This is very clear in the biographical accounts, such as those cited in the precedingnote, and in his own poetical works: see, for instance, the colophons found in Klong-chengsung-thor-bu, vol. 1, pp. 95, 137, 149; vol. 2, p. 622. On the influence of Sanskrit kavya inTibet, see Kapstein in press.10. There does exist a commentary on the Uttaratantrasastra (rgyud bla-ma 'i bstan-bcos),by one Blo-gros-mtshungs-med, that has sometimes been attributed to him, though this attri-bution is doubtful. Reports have recently circulated of the discovery of a manuscript in Tibetthat seems surely to be his commentary on Dharmaklrti's Pramanavarttika.11. Concerning the major writings, refer to Guenther 1975-1976, vol. 1, pp. xvi-xx;Thondup 1989, pp. 149-58.12. E.g., Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 775-779.

The strange tale of the fate of O-rgyan-gling-pa's corpsealso has powerful political implications: Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 777-778.16. Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 294-334, provides an extended doxographical account. Forhistorical background, see Karmay 1988a.17. Klong-chen gsung-thor-bu, vol. l,p. 261. A complete translation of the text from whichthis passage is taken appears in Berzin, Sherpa Tulku, and Kapstein 1987.18. Theg-mchog-mdzod, fol. 202b-221b.19. It is important to note, however, that the myth of Samantabhadra is not, and by theRnying-ma-pa is never taken to be, an actual creation myth: Samantabhadra is neither a cre-ator god nor a demiurge; there is no divine volition posited, through which the ground is thoughtto give rise to the primordial buddha and to sentient beings. Whereas, in the quotation givenlater, the ground is itself made to speak in the voice of the original buddha, there is no evi-dence to suggest that the tradition has ever regarded this to be other than a metaphorical rep-resentation. Nevertheless, some contemporary Western scholars have suggested there to be aquasi-meistic standpoint disclosed in certain aspects of Rnying-ma-pa discourse.

In the Sde-dge edition of the Tibetan Buddhist canon, the Mdo dgongs-pa 'dus-pa is given as text no. 829 (Tohoku Catalogue), where the Rudra myth is detailed inch. 20-31. Commentary may be found in Mun-pa'i go-cha, ch. 20-31; Dgongs-'dus 'grel-chen, ch. 20-31; and Rgya-mtsho mtha'-yas, pp. 401ff. Tibetan traditions concerning thecontroversial history of the transmission of the Mdo dgongs-pa 'dus-pa are detailed in Dudjom1991, vol. 1, book 2, pt. 5.26. Padma bka'-thang, pp. 29-56; Toussaint 1933, 24—42. The proper names here aretranscribed as they are given in the Tibetan text. These names are themselves quite problem-atic: it is clear that O-rgyan-gling-pa is often engaging in wordplay in his composition of them,and Toussaint has attempted to reflect this in his French translation. Nevertheless, some ofToussaint's interpretations are based on unusual readings that have little textual support (e.g.,Ngan-phag, \"Evil Pig,\" for the better-attested Dan-phag, the precise signification of which isuncertain). Because these questions have little bearing on the present discussion, I have pre-ferred not to consider them at length here.27. The exoteric teachings of the surras and the esoteric teachings of the Buddhist tantras.28. That is, as an adherent of the mantra-vehicle and as a monk. It is of interest to com-pare here the analysis of the Newari Buddhist priesthood of the Kathmandu Valley in Gellner1992.29. Various enumerations of five yogas are found in Rnying-ma-pa works. See, e.g.,Dudjom 1991, pp. 280-281, 369.30. Mkhan-po Nus-ldan-rdo-rje, in his Dgongs- 'dus 'grel-chen, pp. 630-635, gives twoalternative enumerations of the \"four matters\": in their ordinary sense, they refer to the fourprohibited actions of murder, theft, falsehood, and sexual misconduct; esoterically, theyare the major categories of tantric vows that are abused when practiced literally andexternally.31. Morality, meditation, and insight.32. Paul 1982, pp. 53-58. The brief discussion of the myth found in Guenther 1984,145-146, is surprisingly superficial.33. Paul 1982, pp. 153-154.34. This is curiously suggested by a comment found in Bsnubs-chen's Mun-pa'i go-cha,pp. 262-263, that \"Rudra having been subject to a violation of voluntary obligation, sentientbeings became subject to a natural violation.\" (rudra ni bcaspa'i hung bar gyurpas 'gro barang bzhin gyis hung bar gyur to.) Mkhan-po Nus-ldan-rdo-rje's Dgongs-'dus 'grel-chen,p. 660, however, emends this to read: \"Rudra was subject to both natural violation and vio-lation of voluntary obligation, and sentient beings became subject to natural violation.\" (rudrani rang bzhin dang bcas pa 'i hung ba gnyis kar gyur la, 'gro ba rnams ni rang bzhin gyihung bar gyur to.) The notion of \"natural violation\" (Skt. prakrtisavadyam) in normativeBuddhist doctrine has nothing at all to do with Western Christian concepts of \"original sin.\"Natural violations are those that are regarded as being intrinsically wrong, such as murder,quite apart from the specifications of any vows or religious commitments one has voluntarilyassumed. Remarkable here is the suggestion found in Bsnubs-chen's wording, and avoidedby Mkhan-po Nus-ldan-rdo-rje, that Rudra's violation is perhaps causally related to that ofsentient beings."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 176-180 26935. Ru-tra'i smre-sngags.36. These are the obscuration with respect to knowledge (Skt. jneyavarana) and the ob-scuration consisting of the psychological and emotional \"afflictions\" (Skt. klesavarana),37. Refer to the commentarial sources cited in n. 25 in this chapter. Throughout his Dgongs-'dus 'grel-chen, Mkhan-po Nus-ldan-rdo-rje takes pains to specify which sections of the texthe regards to be interpretable (drang-dori) and which definitive (nges-dori). His approach to theformer is by no means allegorical in any simple fashion, and his interpretations of the texts allowfor the contextual transformations of symbolic figures. As a brief example, consider his \"demy-thologized\" reading of the birth of Rudra: \"Esoterically, [this means that] the Rudra of cling-ing-to-self has ripened. Losing sight of buddha-nature, the three poisons [aversion, desire andstupidity] adhere to the poisonous tree of the self-aggregates. The child returned to its mother'scorpse is the afflicted mind in its relation to the universal ground [the alayavijnana]. And thisuniversal ground is now seized upon, as self (Dgongs- 'dus 'grel-chen, pp. 642-643).Chapter 101. Because the present chapter requires careful attention to particular Tibetan terms, Ihave in this instance retained the exact transcription of dran- and its derivatives, which inany case are pronounced almost as they appear. In the following list of the terms most com-monly used here, the approximate pronunciation is given in parenthesis: dran- (dren), dran-pa (drenpa), dran-med (drenme), dran-pa'i mi (drempei mi), dran-rig (drenrik).2. The conception of this chapter owes a great deal to a series of conversations in De-cember 1987 and December 1988 that I was privileged to conduct with Ven. Tulku UrgyenRinpoche of Nagi Gompa, Nepal, one of the leading contemporary exponents of the Rdzogs-chen, Rinpoche's reflections on dran-pa revealed the rich vein of Rdzogs-chen thought cen-tering upon this topic and supplied me with the point of departure for the investigation of thetexts here considered. The actual form and content of this chapter, however, represent onlymy own attempt at understanding the texts explicitly discussed and so do not seek to providea documentary record of Rinpoche's observations.3. See ch. 5, n. 50, for relevant scholarship in this area.4. On Klong-chen-pa and his contributions to Rdzogs-chen thought, see ch. 9, n. 8.5. Refer to Gyatso 1992 for studies of memory and mindfulness in these and other Bud-dhist contexts.6. The most important of the distinctive Rdzogs-chen classifications and concepts, asemphasized in Rnying-ma-pa texts, are surveyed in Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 294-345.7. The life of Rig-'dzin Rgod-ldem and his contributions to Rnying-ma-pa Buddhismare summarized in Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 780-783. Refer now also to Boord 1993. For amore extensive biography in Tibetan, see Rgod-ldem rnam-thar. From a traditional stand-point, Rgod-ldem is, of course, the discoverer and not the author of his treasures. But be-cause this entailed his being their redactor, the individual responsible for the precise verbalform in which they have come down to us, I have not insisted on making a distinction thatwould have no practical role in the context of the present discussion.8. The edition referred to throughout the present essay is Dgongs-pa zang-thal, vol. 5of which is in fact the Ka-dag rang-byung rang-shar collection.9. Dgongs-pa zang-thal, 5. 131-149.10. Compare, for instance, the conclusions of the following section with the influentialanalytic philosophical account of memory given in Martin and Deutscher 1966.11. Refer to ch. 6, n. 10. Rdzogs-chen thought often speaks of this in terms of the \"innerradiance that is the body of perfect rapture\" ('od-gsal longs-spyod rdzogs-pa'i sku).12.

For a detailed discussion from a traditional Rnying-ma-pa per-spective, see Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, book 1, pt. 2.13. The Tibetan titles of the chapters are: (1) 'khor 'das gnyis byung tshul (Dgongs-pazang-thal, V.132.2-135.6); (2) skal med man ngag 'di dang mi 'phrad pa (135.6-137.1);(3) rig pa chos skur ngo spradpa (137.1-139.2); (4) Ita ba'i gol sa bead pa (139.2-140.5);(5) lam gyi spyod lam bstan pa (140.5-143.3); (6) rkyen gyis chos sku la nye ba (143.3-145.4); (7) rtogs pa'i dus bstan pa (145.4-146.6); (8) bar dor sangs rgyas thob pa (146.6-147.5); (9) gtad rgya (147.5-148.6); colophons (149.1-6).14. In this context, we must recall the fundamental role of mnemonic concepts in con-nection with the entire phenomenon of gter-ma. See esp. Gyatso 1986.15. ma yengs dranpa'i dpe don blta. Note that ambiguity in the use of the \"genitive\" -'/and the \"instrumental\" -s is very common in the texts here considered, a characteristic thatthese works thus share with Tibetan vernacular literature.

The puzzlement about reflexivity and its relationship to reference that is involved herehas enjoyed a remarkably long history in the writings of the Indian contemplative traditionsand their offshoots.

Compare, too, the passages just cited from ch. 6 of the Wide-Open Tantra. The in-vestigation of the Dgongs-pa zang-thal collection has not so far revealed any special sig-nification to the phrase \"three temporal phases\" (dus-gsum) as it is used in this context; theordinary sense of \"past, present, and future\" may well be all that is here intended. More-over, one interesting passage (Dgongs-pa zang-thal, IV.367.5-6) concerning the bar-docontains the only reference I have found in this material to the canonical doctrine of therjes-su dran-pa drug, the \"six recollections\" (anusmrti), which are not listed in the ordi-nary manner, but rather as recollections of the deity (lha), path (lam), birthplace (skye-gnas),meditative concentration (bsam-gtari), precepts of the guru (bla-ma'i man-ngag), and"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 184-193 271dharma (chos). I believe that this enumeration in fact strengthens my interpretation in thecategories that follow of dran-pa B as mindful attentiveness to the conditions for advance-ment on the path.28. E.g., Dgongs-pa zang-thal, HI. 120-121: \"Mnemic engagement is the ground; amnesisis the path. . .. Mnemic engagement is appearance; amnesis is emptiness.... Mnemic en-gagement is the precept (gdams-ngag) of the waking state; amnesis is the precept of sleep.. ..\"Some interesting observations on dran-med in Indian and Tibetan meditational literature maybe found in Ruegg 1989, pp. 94, 99, 115, 155, 160, 183, 202, 207.29. Knowledge of the importance of repetition as a dimension of soteriological strategywas well established within the Rdzogs-chen tradition. Thus, for example, Mkha'- Iding gshog-rlabs, fol. 37a, insists that the disciple repeatedly receive guidance in the teaching in orderfor it to be firmly impressed upon the mind (yang yang khrid nas yid la 'byor ba dgos).30. For a theoretically provocative attempt to characterize abhidharmic discourse and toanalyze the role of such discourse, see Griffiths 1990.31. Neither is it uncommon for the fictitious agents so portrayed to represent dimensionsof a single psyche. Cf. Whitman 1981, pp. 63-86, esp. p. 85: \"The figures Dante meets arepotentialities of his own soul, possibilities which he briefly activates in his personal vision.\"32. rdzogs-pa chen-po man-ngag-gi rgyud thams-cad-kyi thog-ma.

An antecedent for Rig-'dzin Rgod-ldem's version of this allegory is found in an im-portant Rdzogs-chen tantra, the Rig-pa rang-shar, discussed in Theg-mchog-mdzod, ch. 10,pp. 442-462. See also Guenther 1994.35. The text, of course, does not make it entirely clear how we are to understand this di-vision. I suspect that \"lower vehicle(s)\" (theg-pa 'og-ma) in this case refers to all eight ve-hicles that, according to the nine-vehicle system of the Rnying-ma tradition, are rankedbelow the Great Perfection, or Atiyoga, whose teachings constitute the \"higher vehicle(s)\"(theg-pa gong-ma). See, for instance, the extraordinary passage from the All-AccomplishingKing (Kun-byed rgyal-po) quoted in Dudjom 1991, vol. 1, pp. 295-297, in which the firsteight vehicles are criticized in turn for obscuring, through their false projections, the genuinenature of things.36. Hurvitz, 1976, ch. 3. See, too, the rather neglected monograph, Pye 1978.37. Note the similarity between the revaluation of deception, as characterized here, andthat of mayd, so often thought of as an evil deception, in Buddhist yogic literature. The yogicevaluation of maya is considered in some detail in Kapstein 1992b.38. Barnstone 1984, pp. 308-313.39. Barnstone 1984, p. 311.40. Barnstone 1984, p. 311.41. Guenther 1994, pp. 3-4.42. Guenther's attempt to historicize traditions of Padmasambhava's origins (1994,pp. 26-27, n. 58), for instance, is fanciful in the extreme.43. The tantra in question (Dgongs-pa zang-thal, IV.81-181) in fact has several titles, ofwhich the one used in the chapter colophons best illustrates the centrality of this work in theDgongs-pa zang-thal corpus overall: Rdzogs pa chen po kun tu bzang po'i dgongs pa zangthai du bstan pa 'i rgyud, \"The Tantra Teaching the Great Perfection, the Penetration ofSamantabhadra's Intention.\"44. smon lam stobs po che btab pas: sems can sangs mi rgya ba'i dbang medpar bstanpa (Dgongs-pa zang-thal, IV.171.5-177.6). There are many minor variations in the text ofthis prayer, particularly in its countless vulgate editions. The translation given in the appen-dix strictly follows the text as found in Dgongs-pa zang-thal, however, and the entire text is"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"272 Notes to Pages 193-196translated so as to present some indication of the way in which the topics under considerationare actually distributed in typical passages of Dgongs-pa zang-thal.

See ch. 6, 9, in this book.48. We should note, too, that the emphasis on reflexivity we find here is entirely consis-tent with an emphasis on reflexive acts that runs throughout Rdzogs-chen thought. Cf. Kapstein1988b, pp. 158, 164.49. De Trinitate, Xll.xi. Trans, by Arthur West Haddan in Schaff 1905, p. 191.50. Markus 1964, p. 90.51. Nor should we ignore, in a more thorough comparative study, the historical and doc-trinal roots of the concepts concerned, and the manner in which these contextual consider-ations may alter our initial understanding of them.
