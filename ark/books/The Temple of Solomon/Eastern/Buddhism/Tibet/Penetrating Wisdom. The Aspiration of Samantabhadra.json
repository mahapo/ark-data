Editor’s ForewordPenetrating Wisdomis a commentary by The Dzogchen Pon-lop Rinpoche on “The Aspiration of Samantabhadra.” As the Sev-enth Dzogchen Ponlop, Rinpoche is a direct spiritual heir to theseteachings. He received transmission of this text from His HolinessDilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. Rinpoche’s tremendous scholarship anddirect understanding of these teachings enables him to communicateboth the words and the meaning of this Aspiration Prayer. As such, histeaching is a precious gift of the Dzogchen lineage directly to us.It is our great privilege to have this book published and to assistRinpoche in bringing these teachings to a wider audience. This com-mentary was given in two series of talks to his students in Germanyand the United States. The commentary gives the text a living quality,enabling readers to see its application in daily life. Rinpoche’s use ofcolloquial English, along with his precise translations of both Sanskritand Tibetan terms, gives invaluable insight into the meaning of thetext. For ease of reference, each section begins with the verses of the roottext on which that portion of the commentary is based. When specificlines of the root text are referenced within the commentary, they areagain included in italics. Both Tibetan and Sanskrit terms are renderedphonetically in the text. As much of Rinpoche's commentary usesTibetan terms and translations as a foundation, we have chosen to useprimarily Tibetan for clarity and continuity.

It comes from the primordialbuddha Samantabhadra, known in Tibetan as Kuntuzangpo. Funda-mentally speaking, this prayer is the aspiration of the dharmakayabuddha Samantabhadra. In addition to being the prayer of a primordial buddha, it is a prayerof the path to complete awakening according to the Dzogchen tradi-tion as well as a prayer of instructions that make our path more genuineand correct. It is a prayer that expresses the different manifestationsof rigpa, which is our basic awareness, in ordinary life. Further, it is aprayer and aspiration for the realization of rigpa, the realization of thegenuine path, and the realization of the genuine teacher. It is said that many Dzogchen tantras descended from space onto therooftop of the king’s palace in Uddiyana. Later on, these tantras weretaught by the sambhogakaya buddha Vajrasattva to the great humanmaster of Dzogchen, Garab Dorje. From Garab Dorje, it came to Man-jushrimitra and Shri Simha. From them, it came to Padmasambhavaand so on. I received the transmission of this text from His HolinessDilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and the transmission of this tantra fromTulku Urgyen Rinpoche. Briefly speaking, that’s our lineage.This presentation is based on the commentary by the FifteenthGyalwang Karmapa, Khakyap Dorje. In that way, the presentationbecomes more authentic. “Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 9"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"As this is very much a Vajrayana prayer, it is necessary that we havea genuine ground for making such an aspiration. My teacher gave mevery important instructions concerning this ground. He said it is faith,faith without any questions. It is devotion and trust in the inconceiv-able truth. That is the ground of Vajrayana practices such as this. Believe it or not, faith is the basic requirement for us to enter thepath of Vajrayana, to enter the paths of Dzogchen or Mahamudra. It isa sense of complete trust without much distraction. It is faith, trust,and confidence in the basic ground of inconceivable truth, in the real-ity beyond concept. Even if you don’t have complete faith and trust,it is important to have some sense of openness to the possibility of areality beyond concept, beyond ordinary perceptions. In our day-to-day life, we get totally enveloped in the reality that weexperience through our low-tech sensory perceptions. We believe inour six sensory perceptions, which include concepts. We believe thatthe highest degree of truth is something that we can see, somethingthat we can hear, and something that we can feel. We take them as theultimate authority. We reject everything that is beyond our ordinaryperceptions. The biggest obstacle in the path of Tantra, in the paths ofVajrayana, Mahamudra, and Dzogchen, is completely and utterlytrusting these ordinary perceptions. The truth is out there and it can-not be experienced by these low-tech perceptions. Our modern scientific culture has a very strong dogma of notbelieving in a reality beyond our perceptions and concepts. But evenfrom the modern scientific point of view, our sensory faculties arequite low-tech. We see the coarse elements of existence with these fac-ulties, but when we look at them through the scientific technology ofa microscope and so forth, we don’t find the same reality. In modernphysics, it is seen as some kind of energy field, like a quark. Our sensefaculties are not able to experience that level of subtlety, let aloneinconceivable reality. We usually rule out the possibility of inconceivable reality. We rule10 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 10"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"it out because we cannot perceive it with our samsaric sense organs.We say, “Because I can’t perceive it, I can’t believe in it.” If somethingdoesn’t fit the logic of samsaric confusion, the logic of the self-cen-tered view of egocentricity, then we rule it out. We can’t conceive ofthe inconceivable truth with our samsaric thoughts. These are verystrong obstacles to our understanding Vajrayana. Not everything we learn on the Vajrayana path is necessarily com-pletely conceivable or completely perceivable. In order to understandVajrayana, we need to have some faith in the inconceivable truth. Evenif we cannot have one hundred percent faith and confidence, justleaving some space for that possibility is a good start. Therefore, thefirst important quality on the path of Vajrayana is the quality of faith.We need a sense of openness, at least, to the possibility of nonconcep -tual reality or inconceivable truth. This faith, which is the enlighten-ing thought of the possibility of the inconceivable truth, is the basicground to have a flash of awareness.Usually, people think only of faith in the deity or faith in the lama,but that is not the basic meaning of faith here. The basic meaning herebegins with faith in this inconceivable truth. In Vajrayana, that is thefundamental faith. Therefore, I think it is important to share this veryhelpful advice and instruction that I received from my Vajra master. Itis very important to share it with all of you interested in the Vajrayanajourney. This faith in Vajrayana is not like the conventional sense of confi-dence. Conventionally, you can apply some logic from a conceptualthought frame. But samsaric logic has no value in Vajrayana faith. Solong as you remain in that samsaric logic, the Vajra path does notbecome very stable. So long as samsaric logic is still the ground for ourfaith, our Vajra path is not particularly established. Therefore it can bedifficult; it can be tricky. That is the very challenging beginning of aVajrayana journey. I think Westerners like challenges, so here we havea great opportunity! aspiration prayer : 11Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 11"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"? Vajra MasterWhen i talk aboutthe Vajrayana guru, I usually say it is likethe movie Judge Dredd, where he says, “I am the law.” There isno trial, no jury. It is just straight to execution. In many cases, that iswhat the Vajrayana guru says. I am not here to discourage you, but Ihave to speak the truth. It is a pretty claustrophobic situation that isex tremely dangerous and scary. The Vajrayana master plays a very important role in terms of devel-oping this sense of faith. That is because Vajrayana faith begins withour trust, confidence, and faith in the teacher who is our guide on thespiritual path, and in the lineage that holds the wisdom of such path.It is trust and faith in the fruition of the path as well as in the teach-ings that lead us to the fruition of enlightenment. In other words, it ishaving the sense of positive mind that says, “There have been manylineage masters in the past. There are many lineage masters living atpresent. Yes, this leads to fruition.” Faith in the inconceivable truth begins with our faith in the lineage,with our faith in the Vajrayana path, and with our faith in the Vajra mas-ters. The reason we rely on the Vajra master is that we have already triedmany different methods to wake ourselves up, but none of them reallyworked. We set our alarm clock for the next morning and then, in themorning, it beeps with a very unconfident beep. It beeps because wehave ordered it to beep, but its beep is very feeble. It has a very weak qual-ity because it knows that it doesn’t have the full power to wake us up. Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 12"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"vajra master : 13When this feeble beep happens, our great samsaric command is tomove a hand with tremendous habitual power and press the snoozebutton. Then we go back to our comfortable samsaric sleep. We goback again to the dreams and nightmares to which we are attached.Fifteen minutes later, the alarm clock beeps again. Again, we press thesnooze button. We don’t have this faith, this confidence in the incon-ceivable truth that can wake us up. This goes on for ages, maybe kalpasafter kalpas. That’s why the Hinayana and Mahayana journeys take solong. There is a logic in the ordinary kind of waking up process. Whenyou set the alarm, you choose when it will beep and how loud it willbeep. At the same time, you have the choice not to wake up. It is verylogical. The Hinayana and Mahayana journeys can be very logical. They maywork more closely with the samsaric mind and gradually take you stepby step beyond samsaric logic. But Vajrayana goes beyond logic. Thisis a very important point. Vajrayana is like asking someone to wakeyou up in the morning. You are not relying on an alarm clock. You arerelying on this person, the Vajra master, to wake you up. You really need great faith in this person and great faith in hismethod of waking you up, because there is no logic. You don’t knowhow he or she is going to wake you up, that’s for sure. You need a greatsense of openness because you must hand him the key to your apart-ment. Otherwise, there is no way that he can enter your space to wakeyou up from your samsaric confusion. The process of handing over the key is what we call devotion, whatwe call openness. The trust and faith that we are talking about here islike handing over your key. After that, it is totally up to the Vajra mas-ter as to the methods he or she will use to wake us up. It will definitelynot be an alarm clock. The most civilized method that a Vajra mastermight use to wake us up would be a bucket of ice-cold water. After youget that kind of wake-up call, you won’t have any second thoughts ofPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 13"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"going back to sleep because your samsaric bed is no longer warm andsnug. It is a horrible wet bed with a wet blanket. All you can think of isto get up, just simply to wake up. There is really no other option left. You can see from this analogy that the Vajrayana method is verystrong. It is very striking, very awakening. At the same time, it may notbe a very pleasant or comfortable method for our ego. Therefore, itrequires tremendous faith in the Vajra master and in the Vajra lineage.That faith is the key to our awakening. I am emphasizing this becauseit seems that there is no result produced through any path or any prac-tice without this faith. For that reason, the lineage principle is verymuch emphasized in the Dzogchen tradition. When you have faith at the beginning, it may be conceptual or the-oretical. To a certain degree, if you one-pointedly concentrate ondevotion, on trust, and on faith, it goes beyond concepts. Then youone-pointedly meditate and it becomes a nonconceptual experi-ence. Once you concentrate one-pointedly, it will become a nakedexperience. There is a story about a teacher called Gendün Chöpel. He was agreat Tibetan teacher in the twentieth century. At a certain point, hewas acting a bit crazy. One of his students offered him chang, which isTibetan beer. He was drinking and they were discussing dharma. Thestudent was one-pointed in his devotion and trust. He was one-point-edly concentrating on each and every word of his teacher, no matterwhat he was saying. At a certain point, the student felt a little bitdrunk. He wasn’t drinking at all, but he felt a little bit drunk. He alsosmelled alcohol on his own breath. Then he sort of came back to hisconceptual world and, of course, nothing was there. When he explains this story in his biography of Gendün Chöpel, thestudent says that he felt for a moment that he was in the state of hisguru’s mind, like merging as one. He even had the outer signs of feel-ing a little bit drunk and smelling alcohol on his breath. But the mainthing he felt was actually the mind of the guru, which of course you14 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 14"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"can’t speak or write about in any particular way except to describe theouter signs, symbols, and feelings that he had. This story shows that by one-pointedly putting your faith in thisperson, or in these teachings, there can be some kind of nonconcep-tual experience. In the Vajrayana journey, we call that merging yourmind with the mind of the guru. There’s a sense of a merging throughdevotion and faith, which is definitely connected to confidence andtrust. It is not just blind faith that we are talking about here. Devotioninvolves wisdom and knowledge.With that devotion and faith, we are willing to take this journey tothe other side of the suffering known as samsara, to the great bliss thatis known as nirvana. It is the same as passengers who must rely on theferryman, or on the pilot, for their journey. It is the same idea. It reallyrequires tremendous trust. When you board a plane, you are com-pletely putting your trust in the people in the cockpit. We usuallydon’t think about that. We just walk onto the plane without muchthinking. If you really think about it, you are putting tremendoustrust and confidence in those few people in the cockpit. Your life is intheir hands. For example, I myself don’t know anything about how to fly theplane. It is beyond my concept to fly the plane, but I put my trust inthe pilot. In a similar way, we are putting that same kind of trust in ourVajra master. We are putting that same trust in the Vajra lineage, theVajra boat, the Vajra plane, the Vajra rocket. And with that trust, thatfaith, we take the journey on the Vajrayana path. vajra master : 15Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 15"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"?Lineage PrincipleIn the Vajrayana,lineage is the most important principle of thejourney. Vajrayana was not created in Tibet by some trippy Tibetanmasters or in India by some crazy Sadhu. It was taught by Lord Bud-dha Shakyamuni and by great buddhas in the past. It was kept alive inIndia by many Vajra masters, called the Mahasiddhas, and then it cameto Tibet. There, it was kept alive by the great Tibetan Mahasiddhayogis.How was the Vajrayana kept alive? It was kept alive through thepure transmission of the lineage, the continuity of enlightenmentthat has been given down from master to student. The Vajrayana pathdoes not exist without transmission, which does not come from abook or from a person alone. It comes from the enlightened heart, theenlightened realization. The manner in which the pure Vajrayana transmission is transmit-ted and how it is received has never been institutionalized. It is trans-mitted individually on a very personal basis. Therefore, it has thequality of freshness. In that way, the transmission meets the needs ofan individual practitioner in his or her own style of receiving suchtransmission. That’s the most important point here. Vajrayana depends a lot on interdependence, known as pratityasamutpadain Sanskrit. These little interdependent arisals are impor-tant in Tantra, particularly in the beginning. Even great masters likeMarpa, Milarepa, and Naropa relied on such methods. Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 16"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"It’s not just important in the outer sense. For example, Milarepacame looking for Marpa and found a man plowing his field. SoMilarepa, not knowing it was Marpa, asked this person he had found,“Where is this teacher called Marpa, this very famous teacher calledMarpa, the great translator?” Marpa answered, “I don’t know aboutthat famous teacher, that great translator, but there is a family personcalled Marpa in that house.” He pointed at the house and said, “If youhelp me plow this field, I’ll go and see if he is available. If you get tired,here is beer that you can drink.” So he left one jar of chang, and the restof the field to be plowed. Then Marpa went inside the house and never came out. Milarepaplowed the whole field very well and drank the whole jar of beer. Thisseems very ordinary, very unimportant. But later Marpa said, “Thatwas a great coincidence and very auspicious. Plowing the whole fieldmeans that you will be very diligent in your practice and that you willcut through every obstacle. Drinking the whole jar of beer means thatyou will receive the complete transmission of what I have.” So you see,two seemingly ordinary and unimportant things can be very impor-tant in Tantra. You can never tell what is not important. Only the Vajramaster can tell. Some people may need a slap on their forehead for transmission orelse the teachings may not work. If a person really needs a slap on hisforehead, then the right guru should know. He should also know thatsuch person won’t sue him in the future. In our lineage, Tilopa tookoff his flip-flop and whacked Naropa’s forehead. Naropa fell uncon-scious for awhile and then, when he got up, he was a completely real-ized person. Therefore, transmission is the key on the Vajrayana path,and especially in the Dzogchen tradition. Some of the key instructions are simple, such as when Gampopawas leaving Milarepa. You can read about it in their biographies. It wasthe last time they would be together so it was a very sentimental situ-ation. They couldn’t let go of each other so they went on together fur-lineage principle : 17Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 17"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"ther and further and further. Finally, Milarepa said, “OK, now let’sstop here. You go on your journey but, before you leave, I have a veryprofound instruction that I haven’t given you before.” He pulled hispants down, showed Gampopa his bum, and said, “See this?”Milarepa’s bum was completely hardened with calluses from sitting inmeditation on the rocks. Milarepa said, “That’s the last and most pro-found instruction.” Transmission is very nice. Some instructions are that simple. Others go on and on for yearsand years and years of teaching. Through confidence in our lineagemasters, our lineage teachings, and our lineage Sangha of the enlight-ened beings, we can develop this faith and trust in the inconceivabletruth. Vajrayana is very different from the New Age approach. The differ-ence is that the Vajrayana teachings are controlled by the lineage. Iknow we don’t like the word “control,” but the Vajrayana teachingsare actually held by the authority of the lineage. I know we also don’tlike the word “authority,” but we have it in Vajrayana. When we havethis pure lineage, this genuine lineage, there is no space for our ego-centric interpretation of dharma. We cannot interpret dharma like theNew Age gurus. We cannot invent a new lineage because a lineagemust be received. It must be received by transmission. It is not some-thing we can just create here. That would be New Age, probably fromCalifornia. The Vajrayana lineage controls our ego-centered interpretations ofdharma. We are not denying that there is an individual understandingof dharma, an individual way of hearing, contemplating, and meditat-ing dharma. There is individual understanding of dharma. However,there is a big difference between individual understanding and indi-vidual interpretation. That is why Buddha taught three yanas. Although Buddha gave many teachings, we only hear what we wantto hear. For example, if we want to do just one practice of Mahayana,we only listen to the teachings on Mahayana that we want to hear.

We must not get into the Vajrayana path until weare certain about it. Once we get into it, we should not mess up toomuch. That’s a very dangerous game to play. The best way to control our dangerous journey is to analyze yourguru in the beginning as much as you can. Analyze, examine, and workwith great diligence. Then, come to a conclusion. It will not be thatdangerous if your conclusion is based on a good analysis in the begin-ning. These are some tips to be aware of on the Vajrayana path.The method used to analyze the qualities of a Vajra master has beendescribed in the Vajrayana lineage teachings. Briefly, the first qualityof a Vajra master is that he keeps his vows. This means that he keepsthem pure, whether they are Hinayana, Mahayana, or Vajrayana pre-cepts. The second is that he has received the full empowerment andtransmission of the Vajrayana lineage from his master, who has thelineage. It is not like receiving it from a New Age guru. Rather, it isreceiving the lineage from an authentic teacher who has that lineage.Third, a Vajra master is one who has kept the samaya with his guru per-fectly. In other words, one who has not broken his commitment withthe guru. Finally, a Vajra master is one who has tremendous compas-sion, which means being nonaggressive and nonmilitant. These arethe major qualifications. A Vajra master is also one who has experience in what he is teach-Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 20"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"ing. He is not someone who just digs up lots of books in the library,puts some things together, and goes to the lecture with many notecards, which then become a teaching. It is not like that. Rather, heteaches from what he has received from his master, what he has prac-ticed, and what he has realized or at least experienced. That’s what wecall a good master. The basic Buddhist intellectual approach is a very good basis foranalyzing the master, the path, and the practitioner. If we analyze withthat balance of the intuitive mind and the intellectual mind, thenthere is no doubt that we will find the right path and the right teacher.But if we get carried away into an extreme by either one of them, thenit becomes a really big problem. The proper way to follow the Vajrayana path is to first develop faith.Having developed faith, we can then jump into this path, into thisjourney. Therefore, as preparation for practicing the Vajrayana path,we must reflect on our own heart, our own basic practice, and our ownbasic understanding of dharma. We must reflect on our understand-ing of the teacher, the teachings, and the path. Through this reflec-tion, we can develop this confidence, this trust, and this faith. Sometimes we may misunderstand and say there is no space at all inthe Vajrayana for any kind of doubt. That’s not true. It is very very dan-gerous to say that we must not have any doubts! Buddha said doubt iswisdom. He said that inquisitive mind is wisdom. We are more thanwelcome to have doubts and inquisitive mind about the path and prac-tices. At the same time, we must not go so far with these doubts thatwe get caught up and carried away by them. It is very important for us to reflect on the nature of our path as wellas what we are doing on our path. Reflect on how it is a Vajrayana,Mahayana, or Hinayana path. Reflect on how we face obstacles inpractice. It is especially important to reflect on the teacher-studentrelationship. It is important for us to reflect on what we expect from our teach-guru-disciple relationship : 21Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 21"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"ers. Then we can see how much we project unnecessary things ontothem. We can see how we fantasize about our teachers and make themlook like a bronze statue, a carved African mask, or whatever. It’s nottrue! Our masters in the past were all humans. Those living in the pres-ent are all humans. Shakyamuni Buddha was a human prince. He wasan Indian guy, which we often forget. We think of him as a glowinggolden statue, a beautifully carved wooden statue, or a stone statue,but that’s not true. That’s not who he was.It’s very important for us to see clearly that our teachers are humanbeings. They’re all on the path to enlightenment. The historic Buddhais different, he’s already enlightened, but the rest are all in the sameboat. The only difference is that there may be different levels of reali -za tion; some are on the tenth bodhisattva bhumi, some are on anotherof the bodhisattva bhumis. Some may be on an ordinary bhumi. We must see very clearly what we really expect from our teachersand what we really need. We must see what we expect in terms of guid-ance on the Hinayana path, guidance on the Mahayana path, or guid-ance on the Vajrayana path. We should reflect on that and then just besimple. We are looking for a path and for instruction on that path.That is what you get from most teachers, I hope. We should appreci-ate what we get. If we don’t get enough of what we really need fromour teachers, we should look for more. It is very important for us toreflect on these things and be grounded, so to speak. Then our pathbecomes more fruitful because everything is much simpler. It is morenaked and honest. As we discussed, selective hearing of the teachings is one problem.Selective guru is another problem. We jump from one guru to another.Why? Because one guru may be getting a bit too strict, going a littleagainst our ego, our kleshas, and our emotional interests. When thathappens, we don’t like that guru anymore and we jump to anotherone. We try to find somebody who will tell us that what we want to dois correct, that it is Vajrayana. 22 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 22"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"These problems of selective practice, selective hearing, and selec-tive guru become our major obstacles on the path. They are why wecannot perfect our path. We are stuck in this deep samsaric swamp ofpoverty mentality. We are stuck in dissatisfaction, which was our fun-damental reason for joining the dharma. We bring the same dissatis-faction onto our dharma path, and say, “No, this teaching is not goodenough, this dharma is not good enough.” Do you know the saying that the grass is always greener on the otherside of the fence. Another version is that the other lane is always mov-ing faster. These things are not necessarily happening outside: it ishuman psychology. We call this “dissatisfaction,” or “poverty mental-ity.” Buddha said that this is the basic suffering of human beings. We should not bring this outlook onto our dharma path. It be comesa big obstacle to hearing and practicing Vajrayana dharma. InVajrayana dharma, you cannot simply switch your guru overnight andstill attain enlightenment in this lifetime. It is not possible. If you tryit, Vajrayana becomes a very difficult path. I want to be honest. I want to discourage your fantasies and mis-conceptions of Vajrayana. I want to discourage the neurotic patternthat you bring onto the Vajrayana path, which is that same neuroticpattern of dissatisfaction, of poverty mentality. I am not saying thatyou are the only one to bring this with you. We all do.When we are infected by a serious disease and we go to a genuinedoctor, that doctor will tell us frankly, “You have been infected bysuch and such disease.” Of course, no one likes to hear that. It is verypainful. The doctor may say, “It is very difficult to cure.” We certainlydon’t want to hear that. We would like the doctor to say, “No, it is nota big problem. It is just a flu. I can cure this in one hour if you take suchand such a pill.” It is the same with gurus. If we go to a genuine teacher, it’s verypainful. It was very painful when my teacher told me, “You have todo one hundred thousand prostrations.” It was very painful and,guru-disciple relationship : 23Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 23"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"obviously, I didn’t like it. I wished that I could get another teacherwho would tell me, “You just do one prostration and you will beenlightened.” But that was not the case. If we go to some trippy false doctor, that doctor might say, “Noproblem, I’ll cure you in five seconds.” Maybe he will say that he cancure us in one hour, or perhaps three months. We go through thewhole treatment. We spend our money, our time, our energy, and weare still sick. Finally, we end up going back to the original genuine doc-tor. We end up going back to him because these false doctors cannotcure our disease. Sooner or later, we realize it’s not working. It’s justa fantasy. We have to go back to the painful fact that we have beeninfected. We have to go back to the painful fact that it is not easy tocure. We have to go back to the painful fact that we have to go throughdifficult treatments, such as surgery. It is the same with the dharma path. The fact is that we have beeninfected by the disease of egocentricity. When we go on a genuinepath, with a genuine master, it is not a simple and easy quick-fix. Thatis the fact. We have to come back to reality. With faith and confidence,we have to be more focused on the lineage principle and follow thepainful instructions of the guru. That’s the only way we can cure ourdisease of ego. Is that enough discouragement? I think so. Well, thereis always Prozac, the drug that makes you happy. Question:It sounds like I just need to trust, but what about my criticalintellect?Rinpoche: First, you must be critical, very much so. You must examineand analyze your guru. You must examine and analyze your path. Youmust examine and analyze the lineage. That is very important.Through examining and analyzing, critical mind should come to sometrust, some faith. Critical mind needs a sense of limitation, which is24 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 24"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"based on a certain trust and faith. Buddha said that if you let your crit-ical mind go on forever, then it might lead you to paranoia. At the same time, this doesn’t mean that you cannot ask ques-tions.

When yourcritical mind has come to certain conclusions of trust and confidencein Vajrayana, that becomes faith. Then you continue your journeywith that faith. You can still have a lot of questions and challenges.There is no problem there. The basic point is that we should not losethis faith in the inconceivable truth. Q:Faith has always been very difficult for me. How can I work withthat?R:Fundamentally speaking, in order to awaken oneself in the state ofrealization, we need determination. We need willingness. We need thefaith or trust in our own heart, in the path, and in realization. Withoutthat faith, it’s not going to take place no matter how hard we try. It’slike people who talk about going to Nepal for 20 years but don’t reallymake up their minds to go. They never get there.

In Tibetan, the short title of this tantra is gongpasang-thal gyi gyü, which means “The Tantra of Penetrating Wisdom”or “The Tantra of Transcendent Intention.” In English, the prayer isentitled “The Aspiration of Samantabhadra.” It comes from the pri-mordial buddha of the Dzogchen lineage known as Samantabhadra inSanskrit, and Kuntuzangpo in Tibetan. Kuntuzangpo is the buddha ofdharmakaya enlightenment, the enlightened body of truth.“Dzog” means “to perfect” or “to complete” as well as “to ex -haust.” “Chen” means “great.” So, Dzogchen means “great perfec-tion,” “great completion,” or “great exhaustion.” It is a state of beingtotally free. At this stage, you have exhausted every tiny bit of ego-clinging, every element of emotional disturbances. Therefore, it iscalled “great exhaustion.” It is also called “the great completion”because in that state, all the wisdom of buddha is complete, all the ele-ments of enlightenment are complete. There is nothing missing in thisstate. Finally, because your mind has never been polluted, it has alwaysbeen in this state of complete purity. Therefore, it is called “the greatperfection.”To convey fully the meaning of Dzogchen in English, the expres-sion “full stop” is quite good. Full stop. Period. This period is a littlebut very powerful dot called the full stop.

At thesame time, everything stops here: it doesn’t go beyond this period. Dzogchen has a similar meaning. On the one hand, it has this mean-ing of fullness, which is why we use the term “completion.” It also hasthis meaning of stopping, which we express as exhaustion. Your wholeexpression of samsara has been exhausted, so it stops right here. It doesnot go beyond this. Therefore, Dzogchen is a giant full stop. This sim-ple dot, this period called “full stop,” has a very interesting meaning.So from now on, whenever you see a “full stop,” remember Dzogchen! The Dzogchen lineage originated from the dharmakaya buddhacalled the Kuntuzangpo Buddha. When we look at the thankgas, thepainted images, you usually see the Kuntuzangpo Buddha on the topof Guru Rinpoche. Sometimes you see the Kuntuzangpo Buddhaalone, sometimes you see him embraced with his consort, called theKuntuzangmo, in union. Kuntuzangpo looks exactly like Shakya-muni Buddha in terms of shape and features, but he is blue in color,naked, and without any ornaments or clothing. He is completelynaked reality. The primordial buddha Kuntuzangpo actually taught the Dzog-chen tantras. He transmitted these teachings without any words tothe sambhogakaya buddha Vajrasattva. From Vajrasattva, they came tothe nirmanakaya vidyadhara, the human Vajra master called GarabDorje. Garab Dorje was born in the northeast of India, in Uddiyana,the birthplace of Padmasambhava. In Uddiyana, there was a greatdharma king named Ashoka. He lived much earlier than the Ashoka weusually think of that built the stupa in Sarnath. This king Ashoka hada daughter, a princess called Prahadhani. The princess was practicing celibacy. Once, while she was bathing ina beautiful lake, a beautiful white swan came and touched her heartwith his beak. Later, she had some visions. Afterwards, it was obviousthat she had become pregnant. Perhaps this inconceivable story rings abell. Remember, I laid the ground earlier about the inconceivable truth. 30 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 30"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The princess gave birth to a beautiful son. However, because it wasan immaculate conception, she thought the child must be a very baddemon. So she threw the baby into the garbage. This often happens inour world as well. The baby survived in the garbage for forty-nine days. Not only didthe baby survive, but it was luminous and beautiful. Therefore, theydecided that the child must be something special and they nourishedhim. This little child became Garab Dorje.Garab Dorje was the first human master of the Dzogchen lineage,the first human holder of the Rigpa tradition. He received the trans-mission of all the Dzogchen tantras and teachings directly from thesambhogakaya buddha Vajrasattva. Garab Dorje transmitted the wholelineage to his heart son, Manjushrimitra, an Indian yogi. Manjushri -mitra transmitted the lineage to Sri Simha, a Chinese yogi who livedin India. From Sri Simha, it was transmitted to our famous masterGuru Padmasambhava.If you look at how these transmissions took place, it’s quite amaz-ing. For example, when Sri Simha transmitted the lineage to Padma -sambhava, it is said that he reduced Padmasambhava to the size andform of the syllable(Hüm). Padmasambhava became the syllableHüm. Sri Simha took this Hüm, put it on his tongue, and swallowedit. Then Padmasambhava came out from the other end. At that point,he had received the full transmission of Dzogchen. He received thefull realization and the full experience of Ati Yoga. This is what we callinconceivable! I think this is also sometimes called crazy.Sri Simha also transmitted the lineage to both Vairochana andVimalamitra. Later, these three masters, Padmasambhava, Vairochana,and Vimalamitra, came to Tibet. They brought this Vajrayana lineagetransmission called Dzogchen to the Tibetan soil. They planted thisteaching in the land of Tibet, in the culture and language of Tibet.From then on, we have had the continual lineage transmission of theDzogchen tantras, including this “Aspiration of Samantabhadra.”>great perfection : 31Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 31"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"With that lineage and transmission, this aspiration is very much con-nected to Dzogchen practice and teachings. Vajrayana is also called the Secret Mantrayana. It is kept secretbecause there is the possibility of misunderstanding. There is the pos-sibility of misleading oneself on to the wrong path, which is a paththat goes against our motivation for liberation. Therefore, it is keptsecret and taught between one Vajrayana master and one Vajrayanadisciple. Sometimes Tantric teachings are known as self-secret. They are notnecessarily hidden by someone. They are called self-secret because thelanguage of Tantra is secret, the symbolism of Tantra is secret, and thepractice of Tantra is secret. If you read the Tantra, it’s hard to under-stand. If you look at the iconography, what does it mean that thesebuddhas have animal heads? It is secret. Similarly, if you try to doTantric practice, it is secret. We sleep every night, but it has neverbecome a practice for us. We have dreamed so many times in our life,but it has never become a practice for us. In Tantra, it is practice. It isself-secret practice. That secrecy has to be revealed by what we call thetransmission lineage. Basically, all tantras are protected by the dakinis. Sometimes it isnot very easy to receive their permission. As this is a democratic coun-try, you may be able to get this book from an ordinary bookstore soanybody can read it. But that doesn’t mean you are reading it in aVajrayana sense. Just simply knowing how to explain some wordsdoesn’t mean we are actually teaching Dzogchen. Just simply medi-tating on some deities doesn’t mean we are meditating on Dzogchentantra. What I mean by permission is this Secret Mantrayana permission. Itis permission for us to openly speak, to practice, and to realize. I amnot talking about little beautiful beings called angels. I am talkingabout dakinis; that’s different. Therefore, I hope we have permissionto read and practice such teachings.32 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 32"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"?Five AspectsThe prayer begins with its title, “The Aspiration of Samanta-bhadra.” In Tibetan, Samantabhadra is translated as Kuntu zang -po. “Kuntu” means “completely,” “utterly,” or “purely.” “Zangpo”means “good” as well as “gentle.” So, Kuntuzangpo means “com-pletely pure,” “completely good,” or “completely gentle.” Kuntu-zangpo also means “utterly pure,” “utterly good,” “utterly gentle,” orthe nature of our mind. It is all good, all excellent. It refers to our basicpurity, the basic state of phenomena that is completely free. It is thebasic state of all phenomena. It is the basic state of all our living expe-riences. That state is referred to as Kuntuzangpo. It is also what we callthe primordial buddha. The primordial buddha called Kuntuzangpo is completely pure,completely free, and completely good. It is our basic nature of mind,our fundamental state of being. That state of being Kuntuzangpo isvery much inside. It is very much outside as well. When you look up inthe sky, you find that same purity, that same state of goodness andfreedom, that same principle of Kuntuzangpo. In a similar way, whenwe look at any place outside, we find that same state of purity. There-fore, Kuntuzangpo is the basic nature of all phenomena.There are five different aspects of Kuntuzangpo. These are five dif-ferent ways to understand the nature of the utterly pure, all good, allexcellent state of phenomena. The first aspect is called the Tönpa Kun-tuzangpo. Tönpameans “teacher,” one who shows the path, one whoPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 33"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"shows the nature of mind, one who shows the nature of phenomena.This refers to the Kuntuzangpo Buddha who shows us the path and whois in this ultimate state that is completely pure and completely good.The Teacher Kuntuzangpo provides us with the clarity and precision ofteaching that makes all phenomena appear as the Tönpa Kuntuzangpo.This first aspect of Kuntuzangpo is the Samantabhadra Buddhahimself, the teacher. It is the dharmakaya teacher that manifests in thesambhogakaya and as nirmanakaya buddha. All of those are called theTönpa Kuntuzangpo, the teacher, who is primordially pure, gentle,good, and completely free from any fabrications. The first aspect ofKuntuzangpo is the primordial buddha, which is the enlightenedmaster. The second aspect of Kuntuzangpo is called the Gyen Kuntu -zangpo. “Gyen” means “ornament” and “Kuntuzangpo,” as before,means “completely pure.” Ornament Kuntuzangpo refers to thedharma teachings that the enlightened masters show on the path ofenlightenment. These are like the teacher’s ornaments or attributes.In most cultures, ornaments are usually worn around the neck. Theyare connected to the neck or throat, which, in some sense, is a kind ofspeech center.The nature of the teachings is also utterly pure, utterly good. If wewere to go into details, then we could talk about different kinds ofteachings that are all good, all excellent. So the translation “all good”works very well. It shows that the teachings, the words that we are tak-ing as the path or as instructions on the path, are also in that samenature of primordial enlightenment. Therefore, the words are notsimply words: they are the essence of enlightenment. It is through words that we often get transmission. Through words,we get enlightened instructions. Through words, we communicatewith enlightened beings, the nirmanakaya buddhas. So the words, theteachings, are in the nature of primordial buddha that is the awakenedstate. The teachings are as pure as the basic state of the Tönpa Kuntu-34 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 34"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"zangpo, the completely pure buddha. This is the second aspect ofKuntuzangpo, the Gyen Kuntuzangpo.The third aspect of Kuntuzangpo is called the Lam Kuntuzangpo.“Lam” means “path.” The Path Kuntuzangpo refers to the path ofDzogchen, which means that the path is completely pure, good, orexcellent, right from the beginning. Not only are the tönpa, theteacher, and the gyen, the ornaments or attributes, pure and complete,but the path is pure and complete as well. This means that the path isnot the cause. In Dzogchen, the path itself is fruition. Therefore, thispath is completely pure, genuine, and good. It is in the state of Kuntu-zangpo. The Vajrayana path is known as the path of fruition because we arenot working with causes to produce the result. Instead, we are takingthe result as the path. That’s why it’s a very powerful journey. Kuntu-zangpo is in every state, starting from shamatha at the beginning allthe way to shamatha at the end. Therefore, this path is in the nature ofa primordial awakening. That leads us to the fourth aspect of Kuntuzangpo, Rigpa Kuntu-zangpo. What we are trying to realize on the path is rigpa, which isnaked awareness or bare awareness. That bare naked awareness, rigpa,is in the state of Kuntuzangpo. It is primordially pure, completelypure, utterly pure, and is called the Rigpa Kuntuzangpo.The first three Kuntuzangpos concern the teacher, the teachings,and the path. Rigpa Kuntuzangpo refers to the practitioner. Rigpa isthe nature of our mind, and the nature of our mind is rigpa. Therefore,the primordial buddha is not outside us. The primordial buddha iswithin us, within our mind. When we talk about rigpa, that’s the basicstate of enlightenment. Therefore, it doesn’t matter whether it’s atthe level of fruition of a Kuntuzangpo Buddha or at the level of pathas a practitioner. This naked awareness is the same nature of the Kun-tuzangpo Buddha and the practitioner Kuntuzangpo. Rigpa has the quality of sharpness as well as the quality of genuine-five aspects : 35Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 35"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"ness. In genuineness, there is nothing pretentious. It is beyondmakeup, so we get to this level of nakedness. For that reason, there’s asaying in the Dzogchen literature, “The happiness Kuntuzangpo or thesuffering Kuntuzangpo.” Happiness is utterly pure and suffering isutterly pure. In the ultimate space of Kuntuzangpo, there are no dif-ferences between happiness and suffering, just as there are no differ-ences between inside and outside. It is all in the same expanse of thegreat perfection called Kuntuzangpo. This state of Kuntuzangpo is thefundamental state of all phenomena, whether it is outside or inside,whether it is suffering or happiness, whether it is emotion or freedomfrom emotion. In Dzogchen, they are all in the state of Kuntuzangpo.The nature of mind of all practitioners on this path of Dzogchen isin the nature of this bare awareness, rigpa, the primordial state of bud-dhahood. In other words, rigpa is the realization we are trying toaccomplish. Therefore, the fourth aspect of Kuntuzangpo is the RigpaKuntuzangpo, the nature of mind. The fifth aspect of Kuntuzangpo is called the Togpa Kuntuzangpo.Togpa is realization. Togpa Kuntuzangpo is the realization beingcompletely pure, primordially pure. The realization of this primordialawareness, which is the ground, is a fruition state. It’s a primordialexperience as well as a primordial realization. This means that ourrealization of the Rigpa Kuntuzangpo is nothing new. We have the idea that we will achieve something new after a certainamount of practice. According to the Dzogchen teachings, this real-ization has been with us all the time, primordially. That’s why it isutterly pure, a primordial realization. Therefore, it is Togpa Kuntu-zangpo, which is the absolute result. You can look at Kuntuzangpo in these five different ways. This aspi-ration prayer, called “The Aspiration of Samantabhadra,” comes fromthese principles of Kuntuzangpo, the primordial buddha. We areaspiring to accomplish this state of Kuntuzangpo. 36 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 36"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"?Recognizing RigpaOur mind is primordiallyin the state of rigpa. Whatever stateof mind we go through, whether it is a very heavy experience ofignorance or a very outrageous emotion of anger, we have nevermoved from the state of rigpa. Our mind has always been in the stateof rigpa, but we don’t realize it all the time. When we don’t realize it, there is no continuity of the experience.The nonconceptual experience of rigpa, the flash of the wisdom ofrigpa, is constantly interrupted. That interruption is what is called“covering.” Realization is when we totally overcome that interrup-tion so that the experience becomes one continuity. In more Mahamudra terms, Milarepa said that between two con-ceptual discursive thoughts, you experience nonconceptual wisdom.There is a moment of nonconceptual wisdom in between thoughts.We don’t realize that, we just miss it all the time. We are pretty goodat missing it. Once we have a flash experience of rigpa, we gain a deeper faith andconfidence in this path, in this teaching, and in this realization. Thenit’s not a theory anymore, it’s a firsthand experience. While that flashexperience may just happen to some people, normally it doesn’t. Thatflash experience comes from the pointing-out that you receive fromyour own teacher, your own guru. Then, you will have certainty. Whenwe get that from a Vajra master, and really experience it first hand, itPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 37"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"is beyond guessing. We don’t say, “Oh, maybe I got it, maybe not.”There is no guessing needed because it is direct. In the Dzogchen tradition, it is through combining our devotion,which is our trust and confidence in this inconceivable rigpa and in thelineage masters of rigpa, with the transmission called the rigpa point-ing-out empowerment that we experience a flash of rigpa. Thisdoesn’t mean that our experience of rigpa won’t be interrupted fromthen on. If we nurture that flash, which has been given birth in ourmind, it can be developed into a full-grown youthful experience ofrigpa. The actual nonconceptual state of our experience of rigpa comesfrom devotion. We could say that the experience of rigpa is the real-ization of the guru. When we put our confidence, devotion, and trustin our guru, when we listen to his instructions and totally click intothat state of instruction, then we experience the naked nature ofrigpa. Therefore, devotion plays an important role in experiencingrigpa. Devotion, in some sense, can be taught. It can be explained the waycompassion is explained. We talk first about dualistic compassion.Dualistic compassion is seeing someone suffering, therefore you feelcompassion. That leads us to the state of ultimate compassion, thecompassion of the buddhas, which is nonreferential and beyondduality. Similarly, we could say there is a conceptual aspect of devotion and,at the same time, there is a nonconceptual aspect of devotion that isgenerated through a conceptual devotion. At a certain point, if yourconfidence begins to manifest greater mindfulness, greater awareness,then with the process of devotion, confidence manifests fully andcompletely. That fullness of the manifestation of confidence may notbe any different from the experience of rigpa. Ultimately, what youhave confidence in is rigpa, the Kuntuzangpo nature. That’s what youare realizing. 38 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 38"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The method in Dzogchen or Mahamudra is not complex, it is verysimple.

It is said in both Mahamudra and Dzogchen, “Because it’s too close,we don’t recognize it.” It is like our own eyes, which cannot see them-selves. Gampopa said, “Because it is so simple, we don’t believe it.” IfI just tell you, “It’s so simple. Look at your mind, that’s buddha!,” it’shard to believe, hard to get. One problem with our human mind is that we like complexity, weare addicted to it. When someone presents something with a lot ofcomplex formats, we think it’s very profound. If it’s very hard tounderstand, it must be very profound. But if it’s something very easy,we say, “Oh, it’s too cheap.” That’s exactly what Gampopa was saying.Because it is so simple, we don’t believe it. It’s the same thing in modern society. For example, if you teachdharma in modern society with a pure motivation, without acceptingany donations or charging anything, they will say, “Oh, that’s fishy!Maybe he is trying to propagate something. Maybe he is trying to sellsomething, some propaganda.” But when somebody charges an out-rageous amount for a weekend, like with New Age groups, thousandsof people go. They think it is profound because it is so expensive. Sometimes our mind really works just as Gampopa says. If it’s tooeasy, we don’t believe it. If it’s too close, we can’t recognize it. There-fore, the complex path has been created by our own mind. Don’t mis-understand me, I have no hard feelings toward New Age groups. WhenI used the New Age example, I was not saying it’s totally wrong or bad,I am just trying to clarify the Vajrayana by pointing out these differ-ences. That’s all. recognizing rigpa : 39Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 39"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Question:Is there a difference between rigpa and Kuntuzangpo? Rinpoche:We can understand the difference by examining the fiveKuntuzangpo principles. For example, rigpa is inseparable fromRigpa Kuntuzangpo, but it is slightly different from Togpa Kuntu-zangpo. Togpa Kuntuzangpo is the uncovered state of rigpa. When wetalk about rigpa within our heart, within the minds of sentient beings,we are speaking about rigpa that is temporarily covered. It is in thestate of Rigpa Kuntuzangpo, but it has not yet become Togpa Kuntu-zangpo. While they are basically the same, rigpa in sentient beings ismore of a potential. It is the basic state that has not yet been revealedcompletely.Q: Why is all this taught as being so simple, when doing it turns out tobe so difficult? R: Look at the many stories of the Mahasiddhas. They didn’t get it thefirst time. They didn’t get it the second time. There were many timesthat they didn’t get it. For example, when Naropa received teachingsfrom Tilopa, he didn’t click into it right away. It took some time.Finally, Tilopa got fed up. He took off his sandal and, with his fullstrength, hit Naropa on the forehead. Naropa almost went uncon-scious. At that point, he got it. The method is simple whether it takesa long time or a short time. The practice is simple. It is as simple as the teachings on emptiness.But why has it become so complex? Why is Madhyamaka so irritat-ingly complex? It’s because our conceptions are that complex. It’sbecause the things that need to be transcended are so complex. There-fore, the Madhyamaka, Dzogchen, and Mahamudra teachings mayappear to be complex because of what we need to reject. It is our approach that is making the teaching complex, the teach-40 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 40"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"ing itself is not. Madhyamaka is very simple and straightforward: itjust says shunyata. Dzogchen is straightforward and simple: it just saysrigpa. If you realize rigpa, then you are buddha.

If you don’t realize ordinary mind,you are a confused samsaric being. To realize it, we have to cut throughthis net of conceptual hang-ups. For that, we need the complex Mad-h yamaka logic. If it doesn’t work, then we have Mahamudra medita-tion. And if it still doesn’t work, then there are the Dzogchenteachings. Sometimes it doesn’t work because of the complexity of the defile-ments.

It refers to our group experience of shared karma, which is thecommon experience of different realms. The container is fundamen-tally the same to all of us. You see this as paper, I see this as paper. Sim-ilarly, we both experience seeing the beautiful Colorado Rockies asamazing, especially at sunrise. That’s a common experience to all of us. “Exists” refers to the contained beings in the various realms, suchas the human realm, animal realm, and so forth. As with our groupkarma, beings in each of the different realms experience a commonworld. For example, the sentient beings that live in water have a com-mon experience of the realm of water, whether they live in oceans,lakes, or rivers. The sentient beings that primarily manifest in the skyhave their common experience of living in the sky. That fundamentalor basic experience is what we call “All that appears and exists.” The container and contained include all of samsara and nirvana, allexperiences of samsara and all experiences of nirvana. Samsara is notrecognizing our basic nature. It’s also a perfume from France. Basi-cally, samsara is experiencing phenomena through ego-clinging.When you experience anything through ego-clinging, there is theexperience of samsara. Samsara is nothing more than that.Nirvana is the absence of suffering and pain. Nirvana is also a rockband. Nirvana is the experience of the basic nature of mind, which hasthe quality of freedom and spaciousness as well as the experience ofbasic goodness that is the nature of mind. It is the experience of ego-lessness, which is seeing things as they are. Samantabhadra says that all of samsara and nirvana, meaning allconfusions and all wisdoms, have one origin. They have one commonground from which everything arises. This common ground is alsoknown as the basis. In Dzogchen, that basis performs the function ofgenerating these two expressions called “samsara” and “nirvana.”Both are generated and both appear from the same common ground.Another way to understand this one ground is that there is one ori-46 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 46"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"gin for both Sutrayana and Vajrayana. Again, that’s why it is called onebasis. The fundamental basis of the ground for both Sutra as well asTantra is the basic shunyata, the primordial emptiness. According tothe Dzogchen and Mahamudra traditions, that ground is the alayanature of our mind. So, one ground here refers to all experience man-ifesting from the same fundamental state. That primordial alaya isinseparable from the Mahayana understanding of shunyata. It is insep-arable from the Mahamudra view of ordinary mind.The one fundamental ground is seen in two different ways. It man-i fests as the all-basis consciousness, alayavijnana, or the all-basis wis-dom, alayajnana. In the study of buddha nature, there is a lot ofdiscussion about alayavijnana and alayajnana. We relate to the onebasic nature with two different approaches. With one approach, itbecomes vijnana, consciousness. With the other approach, it becomesjnana, wisdom.From the Dzogchen point of view, it is one basic mind stream.When you look at this mind, which possesses eight different con-sciousnesses from the Mahayana point of view, or six different con-sciousnesses from the Hinayana point of view, it’s one continuity thatmanifests as a samsaric consciousness. Alternatively, the same eightbases manifest as five different wisdoms. Therefore, it is one ground.If you recognize it, it is wisdom. If you fail to recognize it, it is con-sciousness. It is that simple from this point of view. Therefore, thePrayer says, All of sam.sära and nirvän.a has one ground, two paths, and two results. Samsara and nirvana are definitely two different paths. As we know,the path to samsara begins with ignorance and continues on thetwelve links of interdependent origination, the twelve nidanas. Thatis very clearly the path to samsara. If you follow ignorance, the chainbasic purity : 47Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 47"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"of thoughts leads us into the different emotional games and poisonson the path of samsara. If you follow the path of nirvana according to Dzogchen, you go onthe nine-yana journey. You begin with the Shravakayana and Pratyek-a buddhayana, which are the Hinayana; then the Bodhisattvayana,which is Mahayana; then the Tantric path of Kriya Tantra, Upa Tantra,and Yoga Tantra; and then the Dzogchen Tantras of Mahayoga,Anuyoga, and then finally Atiyoga. The nine-yana journey is the pathto liberation, so far as Dzogchen is concerned. In the nine-yana journey of the Nyingma Dzogchen teachings, it saysthat the ground is Madhyamaka, the path is Mahamudra, and the resultis Dzogchen. The first three yanas are the Sutrayana, the ground. Thehighest view in Sutra is shunyata, which is Madhyamaka. On the pathlevel, you have the outer, inner, and secret Tantras: Kriya Tantra, UpaTantra, and Yoga Tantra. In these three yanas, the view is Mahamudra. When you get to the last three yanas of the nine-yana journey,Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga, the view is Dzogchen. It is likeground, path, and fruition in a way. You can say that the ground isMadhyamaka, the path is Mahamudra, and the result is Dzogchen. I taught this before and some Kagyupas got really upset. I think itis pretty strange, because they didn’t think carefully. You cannot reachthe result, no matter how high it is, without the path. You cannot getto the top of the skyscraper, no matter how high it is, without an ele-vator or staircase. No matter how important it is to have the pent-house type of view, you must rely on the foundations. You cannot havethe penthouse without foundations. Without the ground, there is nopath. Without the path, there is no result. That means they are equallyimportant. People don’t understand that and get very upset. Theycling to the notion of result being higher. They get upset because theyare so trapped in this samsaric nonsense of hierarchy. There is no pointto getting upset. Ground, path, and fruition are equally important. If you look at the path element in terms of the Sutrayana journey48 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 48"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"and the Vajrayana journey, it is quite different. In the Sutrayana path,we have the Hinayana and Mahayana methods. In Vajrayana, theDzogchen path consists of various Tantric methods that are differentfrom the Sutrayana methods. The basic elements of the path cannotbe that different, but the methods used are quite different. Therefore,it is said that there are two paths with one ground, one origin. There’s a very interesting joke that I would like to tell you. Twomasters of Mahamudra and Dzogchen were having a debate. TheDzogchen master said, “The Dzogchen is much more profound. It’sthe highest path and the highest yana. There is nothing above. If youpractice in your sleep, you can attain enlightenment. If you practicewhile you are awake, you can attain enlightenment. Even if you don’tpractice, you will attain enlightenment if you have the karmic con-nection. So Dzogchen is much higher.” Then the Mahamudra teachersaid, “Well, that sounds very good, but the Mahamudra teachings talkabout one instant. In one instant, if you recognize it, you attainenlightenment in that same instant. If you fail to recognize it, thenyou are confused. Therefore, Mahamudra pointing-out is much morepowerful because you can attain enlightenment in one instant. Youdon’t have to go to sleep to practice, you don’t have to wake up topractice, and you don’t have to hang around to attain enlightenment.” This prayer shows the same idea as the Mahamudra teachings ofrecognition in one instant. In any given moment, recognizing this all-basis consciousness is enlightenment. It is the five wisdoms of theBuddha. When you fail to recognize it, it is the eight or six conscious-nesses, according to the Mahayana or Hinayana views respectively.The two paths lead to the two different results of samsara and nir-vana. There is the path of consciousness, which leads to the fruition ofsamsaric appearances and suffering, and the path of wisdom, whichleads to the fruition of enlightenment that is the result of freedomfrom samsara. In other words, there are two paths connected to the two differentbasic purity : 49Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 49"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"aspects of the alaya. The first path is called the alayavijnana, whichdoes not recognize its own basic state, its own manifestations. Thesecond path is the alayajnana, which recognizes its own face, its ownmanifestations. The path of alayavijnana, which does not recognize itsown manifestation as its own nature, leads to the fruition of samsara.On this path, one is completely enveloped in a deeper and deeper cycleof duality. When we recognize our own display, our own manifesta-tions, as the nature of alaya, it leads to the fruition of recognizing ego-lessness, the nondual nature of mind, wisdom, nirvana. Therefore,these two paths lead us to two different results. For these reasons, many Dzogchen and Mahamudra masters saythat the view and the teachings of Dzogchen and Mahamudra arecloser to Shentong Madhyamaka. Shentong uses a lot of Yogacaraterms like alaya, and so forth. There are many terminologies in com-mon, so they feel much more comfortable teaching the Shentong viewthat relates directly to the paths of Dzogchen and Mahamudra. It is the display of awareness and ignorance.It is said in the prayer that both awareness and ignorance are a dis-play. This display, this magical illusion, is called chotrül in Tibetan.With recognition, you get the magical illusion of nirvana. Withoutrecognition, you get this magical illusion of samsara. It is like an electric switch. If you turn it off, then you have darkness,ignorance. If you turn it on, then you have luminosity, recognition.It’s just how you flip the switch. Here we are saying the same thing. Ifyou recognize it and look in, it’s called nirvana. If you fail to recognizeit and always look out, then you are on the wrong side of the switch.It’s very important for us to know this simple switch between samsaraand nirvana.If you look at the paths of Sutrayana and Tantrayana, the result isstill said to be different. The enlightenment of the Sutrayana differs50 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 50"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"from the enlightenment of Tantrayana. The Hinayana path leads tothe result of arhathood, which we call partial liberation. The Maha-yana path leads to the full enlightenment of the Mahayana path. TheTantrayana path leads to the full enlightenment of the Tantric path. Basically speaking, there is a difference in the result because Sutraand Tantra have different views in approaching the manifestation ofthe buddhas. In the Sutrayana approach, buddhas manifest in onlythree kayas. In Tantrayana, buddhas manifest in five kayas. The basic difference is that the Sutrayana view of dharmakaya iscomplete emptiness, basic shunyata. Chandrakirti said very clearly inthe Madhyamakavatarathat when the continuity of any consciousnesscomes to cessation, that is dharmakaya. In the Tantric approach, dhar-makaya is not just an empty state. It is not just cessation. Dharmakayais the state of the inseparability of wisdom and space. The wisdom ele-ment is very important here. Dharmakaya is not just empty, it is full ofqualities. It is full of the qualities of wisdom, yet it is in this nature ofexpansive space, which in Tibetan is called long. So, with respect to Sutrayana and Tantrayana, the nature of dhar-makaya is different. In the Sutrayana, the characteristic of dharmakayahas fallen a bit into the extreme of emptiness. In Tantra, there is theemphasis on the inseparability of space and luminosity. This insepara-bility is the union of the great expanse of shunyata and the full-of-quality luminosity, called “abhisambodhikaya.” This union is thecharacteristic of dharmakaya in Tantra.Because the characteristic of dharmakaya is different, the blessingis different as well. In the Sutrayana, dharmakaya manifests blessing inthe two kayas of sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya. In Tantrayana, theblessing manifests in five kayas. It manifests in the dharmakaya, thebody of truth, as the origin. The second kaya is the sambhogakaya, thebody of enjoyment. The third kaya is the nirmanakaya, the body ofmanifestation. The fourth kaya is what we call the vajra body, thevajrakaya. The fifth kaya which is called the completely or thoroughlybasic purity : 51Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 51"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"enlightened body, abhisambodhikaya. That’s the difference betweenthe dharmakaya of Sutra and Tantra. There are two differences between Sutrayana and Tantrayana withregard to the sambhogakaya. Here, enjoyment refers to yönten, rich-ness. In the Sutrayana, that richness is basically the enjoyment of pos-itive actions and qualities. In the Tantrayana, sambhogakaya has therichness not only of the enjoyment of positive things, but also of tran-scending the negative things. The second difference is the teaching method. The Sutrayana sam-bhogakaya teaches the Sutra methods to go beyond negative emo-tions. It teaches positive deeds, positive actions, and positive dharma.The Vajrayana sambhogakaya teachings include such good things asthe paths and bhumis, but it also provides methods for dealing withour disturbing emotions. Our disturbing emotions are very strong andvery difficult to deal with. The Vajrayana sambhogakaya is focused onand teaches the methods to transcend disturbing emotions. There-fore, there is a difference in the method of teaching. Finally, there’s a difference between the Sutrayana buddha of nir-manakaya and the Tantrayana buddha of nirmanakaya. The Sutrayananirmanakaya buddha was the historic Buddha. The retinue of closedisciples of Shakyamuni Buddha were those who had that fortunatekarma. It consisted of those who had already somewhat purified theirnegative karma. Therefore, they could see the Buddha, they could bewith the Buddha, and they could succeed on the path. The retinue of the Tantric nirmanakaya buddha of Dzogchen is notalways positive. It does not necessarily include only realized beings onthe path. The retinue of the Tantric buddha is mixed with more dis-turbed sentient beings. That is why it is said that Tantra is very effec-tive in this polluted time. Tantra becomes more effective because ourmind is so polluted, so completely disturbed with emotions. For thatreason, in the Nyingma tradition, many teachings have been hidden52 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 52"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"for centuries. Guru Rinpoche hid them in different places so that theycould be discovered when our minds would become polluted. At thattime, such teachings are beneficial. Therefore, the Tantric buddha notonly benefits those with fortunate karma, it also benefits those withnegative karma. Therefore, there’s a difference at the end. That’s whyit says two results. Through the aspiration of SamantabhadraMay all be fully awakened In the citadel of the dharmadhätu.When the Prayer says, “Through the aspiration of Samantabha dra,”it also means that we recite these verses from our basic purity. Werecite them from our basic nature of mind that we call buddha nature,that is alpha-pure, and that is in the state of buddhahood, Kuntu -zangpo. By the power of that purity, that dharmata which is theessence of our nature, we make the aspiration that “all be fully awak-ened in the citadel of the dharmadhatu.”Dharmadhatu means the nature of phenomena. Generally, when wetalk about dharmadhatu from the point of view of a subject-objectrelationship, it’s more like the object. The wisdom of dharmakayarealizes the nature of dharmadhatu. Dharmadhatu is like the space ofshunyata, which is realized by dharmakaya wisdom. Dharmakaya isusually referred to as wisdom, which can be further classified into jitawa, the wisdom of seeing things as they are, and ji nyepa, the wisdomof seeing things in their varieties, to their extent.In a similar way, there’s a vajradhatu in Tantric traditions. Vajra -dhatu is the fundamental space of the vajra nature of mind. Dhatumeans “space.” In some sense, both dharmadhatu and vajradhatu havethis sense of the union of ying and rigpa, which we call ying rig tseinTibetan. There’s also a vajrakaya, which is the fundamental kaya ofbasic purity : 53Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 53"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"enlightenment. Vajradhatu, that basic nature of all things, is experi-enced by the vajrakaya. When we say, “Through the aspiration of Samantabhadra,” we’renot only thinking about the buddha, the dharmakaya Kuntuzangpo,but we’re also thinking about the speech, the ornament of Kuntu-zangpo; the path Kuntuzangpo, which we follow; the rigpa Kuntu-zangpo, which is part of us; and the realization of Kuntuzangpo. Withthese, we aspire that all be fully awakened in the citadel of the dhar-madhatu. That great space, that great nature of phenomena, is thepalace where all samsara and nirvana perform their magical display.Our prayer is “May all be fully awakened in the citadel of the dhar-madhatu.” We aspire that all sentient beings realize this nature ofawakened mind. Our aspiration is to realize that the display of rigpaappears as the forms of samsara or nirvana as well as that all sentientbeings recognize their own display of the clarity nature of mind. It seems to be necessary to have clarity in order to actually projectduality. In other words, duality comes from failing to recognize clar-ity. For example, you need light in order to reflect in a mirror. In a sim-ilar way, you need light to project the negatives of film onto a screenin order to create that duality. From this teaching’s point of view, ourclarity nature of mind is so vivid and so intense that it manifests as sub-ject/object duality to ordinary beings. When we recognize that theseemingly object nature of reality is nothing different than the subjectnature of mind, which is rigpa, it is called enlightenment. When we seethat truly and recognize that genuinely, we make this aspiration thatall beings be fully awakened in the citadel of the dharmadhatu, thebasic space in which the clarity is manifest.54 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 54"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"? Ground and FruitionThe next aspirationshows the relationship between groundand fruition. It shows that the ground of all is an uncomposedand inexpressible self-arisen expanse without the names “samsara”and “nirvana.”The ground of all is uncomposed, This shows the ground nature of samsara in relation to the fruitionstage of buddhahood, which is enlightenment. From the Dzogchenpoint of view, the ground nature of all samsara and nirvana is uncom-posed. This means that the ground itself is neither a cause nor aneffect. The ground is not really a cause that produces the fruition ofbuddhahood. We are making a leap here from our basic studies ofHinayana and Mahayana to some kind of weird Dzogchen concept. The ground we talk about here is the nature of mind. It is theground of the nature of samsara and of nirvana. The nature of mind,the basic state of rigpa, has not been produced by any cause or condi-tion. Therefore, that nature of ground is uncomposed. There’s a level of ground we talk about called shönnu bum-ku, youth-ful buddha in a vase. The youthful buddha is fully shining in that stateof complete enlightenment. However, it does not manifest completeenlightenment because it is covered by the temporary veil of a vase. Itis like a torch or a butter lamp inside a very thick container. When youPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 55"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"open that container, the light fully manifests and whatever room it isin will be illuminated. The illumination is nothing new so far as thelamp is concerned. It has always been glowing. In a similar way, buddhahood is not something new. It is not some-thing newly realized or accomplished from the point of view of theground. From the very nature of the ground, a full state of buddha-hood manifests its complete qualities. Therefore, the Prayer says thatthe ground is:An inexpressible, self-arisen expanseWithout the names “sam.sära” and “nirvän.a.”Here, “self-arisen” means the primordial state. It is not somethingwe can fully express with words or concepts. It’s beyond words orconcepts. The nature of all is not biased; it is not restricted to one oranother. The nature of all exists in one identical state. That ground,that nature, does not have any name such as samsara or nirvana. Thatis the foundation, that is the ground. It is beyond samsara and nirvana.Not knowing the ground means wandering in samsara. If you recog-nize this ground, if you truly experience this ground, buddhahood isattained. That is the fruition. That is the result of our practice and ourpath. We call that one origin Kuntuzangpo, the primordial buddha inDzogchen. It is also known as kadakin Tibetan. “Ka” means “alpha”or “primordial” and “dak” is pure, or purity. Kais the first letter ofTibetan alphabet, sokadakmeans pure from the beginning. Ka ne dagpa, to make it a full word, means pure from the beginning, which is thestate of Kuntuzangpo. It is the state of rigpa, which is the state of purefrom beginningless time. That state of primordially-pure nature, thenature, is called emptiness or shunyata in the Mahayana. It is alsoknown as freedom from elaboration. The ground, that fundamental state of simplicity, is the origin of all56 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 56"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"elaborations. This pure basic state is like a simple artist’s canvas. Wepaint different images on this canvas. We can paint the image of a bud-dha, and it becomes very pure, beautiful, and inspiring to look at. Wecan also paint a devil on the same canvas, which can create our funda-mental suffering, our basic pain. However, the basis of both is thesame simple state of canvas that is completely pure and totally freefrom the images we project on it. It is totally free, whether that imageis a buddha or a devil. That is the origin.The state of primordially pure nature, kadak, is not made by any-thing. It is uncreated. This means that the fundamental state of ab -solute reality, the basic ground, has never been compounded by causesor conditions. That nature of primordial purity, kadak, is beyond anyelaboration. It is beyond conceptual formation, which means it isbeyond philosophy. It is not created by any creator, outside or inside.It is not created by Kuntuzangpo nor was it created by any buddhas inthe past. Therefore, whether we are talking about the nature of ourmind or the nature of the universe, primordial purity exists in thatnature. Both exist on that ground which is completely free from con-ceptual elaboration, primordially pure. That’s why it is simple. The primordial pure nature is spontaneously existing. When onerecognizes that origin, that most fundamental state of Kuntuzangpo,one is called “buddha” or “one who has attained liberation, nirvana.”When one misses that point and fails to recognize the primordial stateof buddhahood, one slips into the samsaric ocean. Therefore, it is saidthat there is one origin for both samsara and nirvana. So it is really not much different. The difference is between aware-ness and ignorance. Isn’t it simple? Sometimes, teachers say that thebasic teaching of Dzogchen and Mahamudra is as simple as this.Because it’s so simple, people don’t get it. Because our mind has thiscomplexity of duality and ego-clinging, we make it more complex. This shows that Samantabhadra attained buddhahood through therealization of this kadak, the alpha-pure nature of mind. The primordialground and fruition : 57Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 57"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"buddha has seen and recognized that the nature of ground is free fromcauses or conditions. This is called the great way of liberation of thekadak nature of mind. The ground is free from the causes and conditionsof any effort on the path as well as from conditions of fruition. There-fore, it is seen as the natural state of this great freedom called kadak. Kadak exists in the form of this great expanse that is completelyspacious. That spaciousness is called the spontaneously-arising ex -panse. It’s part of the kadak, the alpha-pure. Alpha-pure does not justmean negation of impurity, of ego-clinging, or of emotional distur-bances. There is some existence. That combination makes our groundbalanced between emptiness and spontaneously arising luminosity.There is a union of the two in the state of kadak, alpha-purity. Spontaneously-arising luminosity, lhündrup, is present right fromthe beginning. That’s why it becomes an important issue to under-stand. So, that nature of kadak is not just in the state of being pure,empty, and free, but it is in the state of a spontaneously-arising ex -panse. It is not nonexistent. It exists in the state of primordial exis-tence. That existence is not a creation. It’s a spontaneous arising.In Dzogchen, the wisdom that we are realizing on the path is thereright from the beginning. It is existent right from the beginning, atthe ground level. The ground of the kadak can be divided in many dif-ferent ways, but the general division has three bases. The first is calledthe general basis, the second is called the basis of liberation, and thethird is called the basis of confusion. So kadak is the basis of every-thing. It is the ground of both samsara and nirvana. The ground has two wisdoms. First, it has primordial purity. That isthe ground of primordial nature, the fundamental basis of our mind.It is the kadak. The second wisdom is lhündrup, which is sponta-neously arising or spontaneously existing. These two wisdoms are thenature of our ground, which is inexpressible. These two wisdoms aresomething to be realized, something to be experienced. They arebeyond words. All the words we use are simply methods to reach58 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 58"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"there, but the actual state of these two is beyond speech. If you thinkyou are speaking completely about these two aspects of ground, thenyou are fooling yourselves. In that nature of the inexpressible truth, the ground of kadak, thelabels of samsara and nirvana do not exist. These labels are just con-ceptual. They are just discursive thoughts. The labels of samsara andnirvana do not exist in this fundamental nature because it is oneground. So, samsara and nirvana both originate from the same ground ofalpha-purity. That ground is spontaneously existing, which meanskadak and lhündrup. At that primordial level, there is no separationbetween samsara and nirvana. There is no way that we can express andlabel these two as different things in this state of kadak and lhündrup.If it is known, buddhahood is attained.Not knowing it, beings wander in sam.sära.Kuntuzangpo says that when you have the pristine awareness torecognize that ground of suchness, then you are called enlightened.When we fail to realize that ground, when we ignore that state ofground and get fascinated by the labeling process of thoughts, we arecalled “beings wandering in samsara.” Being fascinated by these mag-ical illusions, by little magic tricks of ego, is called samsara.Recognizing this ground is not just something that we discuss. It isnot just something that we should listen to or that a speaker shouldspeak about. It is something that we try to realize in our daily practiceof meditation. It is something that we can think of achieving in ourdaily sitting practice, in our daily awareness. This is important to con-template.According to the Dzogchen tantras, as well as the Mahayana, ulti-mate reality is inexpressible.

Forget about absolute truth andforget about the ground, we cannot even express by words the actualreality of relative truth. We can say some part of it, but we cannotreally express our suffering. We cannot really express our joy. We can’teven express our bittersweet experience of a chocolate. How can weexpress even that experience? There is no way to express it, you know. We have to use an exampleto lead towards it, but the actual thing that we experience in ourmouth, such as a piece of chocolate, cannot be expressed. We have tosay that it is sweet, it has milk, and it has bitterness, like chicory. Wehave to use many different things to try to express one simple taste ofchocolate. We can never say the actual thing. This is the ground that we are trying to realize and toward which weare making the aspiration. Therefore, the Prayer says that the groundis an inexpressible self-arisen expanse without the names “samsara”and “nirvana.” It is beyond samsara and nirvana. If we recognize thisground, that is buddhahood. Not knowing this ground means wan-dering in samsara. Since this is something to be realized, somethingwe want to achieve, we make this aspiration prayer by saying, May all beings of the three realms know the inexpressible ground.We are making the aspiration here that all sentient beings of thethree realms recognize this inexpressible ground. Because it is thenature of their mind, it is the nature of their realm. As it is the natureof their world, they do not have to go out and search for this ground.It is wherever they are. “The three realms” refers to the realm of desire, the realm of form,and the realm of formlessness. We belong to the realm of desire. Thereis no doubt about that. From the Buddhist point of view, the realm ofdesire includes the six realms: the hell realm, the hungry ghost realm,60 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 60"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"the animal realm, the human realm, the asura realm, and part of thegods’ realm.

Question: Does a student with a lot of problems in the beginningbecome a more effective teacher than one who didn’t have to facemany problems?Rinpoche: Not necessarily. To be a good master really depends on yourintention. If you have the very strong pure intention to dedicate yourtime and your energy to help somebody, you can help a lot of peopleeven if you are not a great scholar. There is a story about two great masters who wrote separate com-mentaries to the same text. Chandrakirti was a greatly respected mas-ter and a well-known scholar. Chandragomin was equally respected asa master but was not so well known as a scholastic conqueror. Chan-drakirti is a great bodhisattva, so I cannot judge the truth of this, butthe history says that he did not write his commentary with the puremotivation of helping, but rather with some scholarly pride. Chan-dragomin wrote his commentary with compassion, love, and caringfor his students. He wrote it like a textbook. We no longer have Chan-drakirti’s commentary, it’s been lost for a long time. No matter howgood it was, we can’t read it. But Chandragomin’s still exists and wecan still read it. So the saying is that when the motivation is pure, thebenefit is greater. ground and fruition : 61Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 61"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Of course if we become a good teacher and have gone through a par-ticular problem, we have more experience and more knowledge tohelp somebody going through that same problem.

What we are saying isthat the nirvana we conceptualize right now as separate from samsara,and as something to be achieved, is another magical illusion. When weachieve the state of nirvana, it’s actually not different from the pri-mordial state. There is no separate state. When you think nirvana issomething to be attained at the end, that nirvana is a magical display.It is still relative so long as we have the conception of nirvana.

Q:If we are faced with very destructive energy from ill-wishing peo-ple, couldn’t we see them as manifestations of some deity that is try-ing to help us? R:In the Tantric as well in the Mahayana sense, those who are tryingto harm us are actually helping us. They help us to practice the parami-tas so that we can attain enlightenment.

Butthat experience is not ultimate rigpa. It is not the fullness of rigpa.There are three stages one goes through: understanding, experience,and realization. Realization becomes a critical quality on the path,because realization is the fullness of the experience of rigpa. You haveto go through the different stages of experiences and not get attachedto them. Go continuously on the path. Eventually, that will lead torealization. When you have the realization of rigpa, that realization isirreversible. Q:Is there a buildup of awareness that happens by the practice of rec-ognizing or looking for your own basic nature so that, over time, it dis-pels the fear of these emotions?R: Yes, awareness is developed through the discipline of meditation.Beginning with shamatha meditation, we develop lots of awarenessand mindfulness on the path. Then, in Mahamudra and Dzogchen, weemphasize a different aspect of mindfulness and awareness. Mindful-ness and awareness come from the discipline of meditation, whichcontinues in our everyday life. Therefore, formal sitting practice isvery important for us. For that reason, many teachers tell us to sit atleast 10-15 minutes every day.

All ofthe poisons arise in the nature of self-arisen awareness. “Self-arisen”is similar to the notion of the connate or co-emergent nature of mind.When we talk about the self-arisen in the nondual sense, we’re basi-cally talking about a vivid experience of anything. Any vivid experi-ence has this nature of self-arisen nondual experience. When you havethat vividness, and awareness within that vividness, the experience issomehow beyond concepts of duality. That’s the view of practice inDzogchen and Mahamudra. When you see these poisons arising, you see the self-arisen aware-ness. When you see the poisons manifesting so vividly, so nakedly, andso abruptly, you have a greater chance of awakening. When you don’thave these vivid, abrupt, powerful, and overwhelming emotions, youhave a lesser chance of awakening, according to the Mahamudra andDzogchen view. When these five desirable objects manifest in the paths of Dzog-chen and Mahamudra meditation, they manifest so vividly. The expe-riences are so vivid and so close. It’s not like talking about rigpa.

One can bring oneself to the experience of the ground by resting inthe spontaneously-arising awareness, rather than being attached tothe enjoyment of the five samsaric sensory objects.

We are then free from the fivepoisons of the mind, including the three basic poisons of desire, alsoknown as attachment; hatred, also known as aggression; and delusion,also known as ignorance; as well as the poisons of pride and jealousy.One is free from these five poisons if one’s sensory perceptions sim-ply experience what they are without labeling thoughts. This is very similar to Tilopa’s instruction to Naropa. At the end ofNaropa’s trials and tribulations, Tilopa hit him on the forehead withhis sandal and said, “You are not bound to samsara by appearances, youare bound to samsara by conceptual attachment. Therefore my son,Naropa, cut the root of this attachment.” The appearances of theworld outside, which are the experiences of the five sensory percep-tions, are not a problem. The problem here is the labeling process thatfollows it. Whatever sensory experiences we go through, if we go throughthem with mindfulness and awareness, there is no limit to how far wecan go. The limit is mindfulness and awareness. Even if we don’t enjoythe experience, that itself becomes a trip. The nonenjoyment becomesa cause of suffering. That’s why, if we don’t practice mindfulness andawareness, asceticism just becomes pain rather than a cause for liber-ation. That’s why Buddha said to forget about asceticism. That’s whatBuddha did. He left asceticism, became very mindful in every step, andachieved enlightenment.To develop mindfulness and awareness, it is important to practicestillness first.

Alayajnana will come nat-urally in the process of settling alayavijnana. Being mindful is the best discipline as well as the hardest one. Justshutting off sensory perceptions from objects is easy. If there is avisual joy, we can just turn our back on it. We can shut ourselves up ina mountain cave. But if we are not mindful, we carry the whole dis-traction into the cave. The causes of pain continue and the pain is stillthere. The discipline actually is mindfulness. It’s not easy.

This ele-phant is swimming in his crazy ideas, in his wildness, so we need tochain him down. That chain is mindfulness, which is the first step toactually bringing this crazy elephant down to earth.

The emotional disturbances of samsaric phenomena have no cessa-tion. There is no cessation of that ego-clinging. There is no cessationof our self-centricity. There is no end because it never existed to beginwith. It has never been given birth to. The wisdom of seeing that truenature of phenomena is what we call dharmadhatu wisdom. This is thefirst wisdom of buddha.The unimpeded nature of this clarity manifests like images in a mir-ror. That is the second wisdom, called “mirrorlike wisdom.” The mir-ror like wisdom of buddha has the quality of egolessness because it isfree from ego-identification. This wisdom is beyond conceptual see-ing and beyond conceptual understanding. Therefore, it is taught withthe example of a mirror. If we place ourselves in front of a big mirror, everything appearsinstantaneously. It doesn’t happen that first one row of images arises,then a second row, then a third row, and so on. At the same time, a mir-ror does not identify each thing that reflects in it. It does not say,“Okay, now the trees are reflecting. Now the carpet is reflecting. Nowthe people are reflecting. These are such and such people. This is suchand such color of reflection.” There is no such egotism in that wisdomnature. In a mirror, everything reflects simultaneously. Therefore, thisis called “mirrorlike wisdom.”In a similar way, for a buddha, the phenomena of the three timesreflect simultaneously. Everything arises simultaneously. There isneither a progression of seeing nor a progression of conceptualiza-tion. A buddha sees the three times in one instant. That is the exampleof mirrorlike wisdom. As we discussed, in whatever variety they may appear, appearancesare in the same nature. That’s the third wisdom, called “the wisdom ofequality or equanimity.” This refers to the wisdom of selflessness.76 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 76"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Selflessness leads us to the ultimate realization of equanimity. Equa-nimity here refers to the equality of duality. It means there is no longerany difference between the self of phenomena and the self of person.The distinction of duality as perceiver and perceived is no longer madeat this point. Therefore, the wisdom of buddha sees the true nature of this equalstate. Whether you are looking at the phenomenal world outside, suchas a table, a house, mountains, and so forth, or at your own self as a per-son, they are equally selfless. Both rest in the same nature of equalitythat is emptiness, shunyata. The realization that is the ultimate seeingof that selfless nature is what we call the wisdom of equality. The wisdom of equality arises in the bodhisattva path from thepractice of exchanging oneself for others. We try to see the sufferingof others, and we try to take the pain from others. We try to transcendour self-clinging through taking on the self-clinging of others. As aresult, you get this wisdom called “the wisdom of equanimity.”The fourth wisdom is the wisdom of discrimination, which is com-pletely free from delusion. It is a sense of sharpness and precision. Dis-criminating wisdom refers to a buddha’s wisdom of seeing relativereality. Mirrorlike wisdom is the basic clarity that reflects in the mir-ror while discriminating wisdom sees the distinctive features andqualities individually. It is the wisdom of seeing appearances, of see-ing how things exist. For example, it is the wisdom to discriminate thenature of the outer phenomena as being impermanent and the natureof phenomena as being emptiness. It is the wisdom to discriminate thenature of things existing in different levels of confusion in the sam-saric realm. That wisdom is called “the wisdom of discrimination.”There is an example of how buddhas see this. If one of us falls asleepand has a nightmare, or has some painful illusion in a dream, a personwith clairvoyance can see that. He can see that sleeping person goingthrough tremendous pain for no reason. That person is experiencinga lot of fear in the dream. Maybe that person is being chased by afive wisdoms : 77Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 77"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"poisonous snake or a tiger. In that dream, he has objects of fear andhe has a subject who fears. He is running through that illusion of pain. For the person who is clairvoyant, none of this exists. The personwho sees is not going through the suffering. He can see that the sleep-ing person is simply dreaming. The clairvoyant person knows that ifthis person awakens from the dream, then he will be totally free fromthat illusion of fear. So the clairvoyant person may try to wake thisperson up by using a particular method, perhaps by speaking a littlebit louder. Such seeing by a clairvoyant person is what we call “the dis-criminating wisdom of a buddha.”All of these wisdoms arising naturally, spontaneously, and effort-lessly is the fifth wisdom, called “the all-accomplishing wisdom.” Theall-accomplishing wisdom refers to the manifestations of a buddha’sactivities. This wisdom, manifesting in such outstanding ways, can beso beneficial to wake people up from the dream. The wisdom of know-ing the best method to awaken beings from the nightmare of samsarais called “the all-accomplishing wisdom.” Accomplishing all the relative and ultimately-beneficial things forall sentient beings is what we call “all-accomplishing wisdom.” There-fore, buddha sometimes uses the bucket of water method to wakesomeone up. If you use a bucket of water, sometimes the sleeping per-son might die from the shock, or perhaps have a heart attack. In thosecircumstances, buddha wouldn’t use a bucket of water, but wouldinstead simply present an alarm clock to this person. The differentmethods of accomplishing enlightenment are called “the all-accom-plishing wisdom.”These are the five wisdoms in one, as it is taught. This explanationis not from my first-hand experience. It is from my first-hand concep-tual understanding of the five wisdoms of a buddha. 78 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 78"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"?

Briefly, with respectto the forty-two peaceful manifestations, we have Kuntuzangpo Bud-dha and Kuntuzangmo, the female buddha, together. Then we havethe five buddhas of the five buddha families that we previously dis-cussed. These are called the five male buddhas. Then we have fivefemale buddhas, called ying chug ma, who are their consorts. Yingmeans “space,” so they are called the “five female buddhas who havepower in space.” Then we have eight male bodhisattvas, and eightfemale bodhisattvas. According to Nyingma tradition, each realm hasits own buddha, so there are the six buddhas of the six realms. Finally,we have four male gatekeepers and four female gatekeepers. Thatmakes forty-two peaceful emanations of buddha. If you are interestedin the details, these can be studied in the bardo teachings. From the further manifestation of wisdom, the sixty wrathful man-ifestations of buddha arose. This is a very Vajrayana thing. If you’re notready, just shut off your senses. You don’t have to listen. The wrathfulmanifestations are male and female wrathful herukas, wrathful bud-dhas, bodhisattvas, and other deities. They are known here as the sixtyblood drinkers. The Tantric teachings are said to really benefit those who have verystrong poisons, very strong emotions. For that reason, the wrathfuldeities play a stronger role on the path of awakening in Tantra. I thinkthat Tantric deities manifest with more extreme measures because ofthe intensity of our poisons. Padmasambhava said that in the kaliyuga,the polluted age, Tantra manifests in its full power and energy.

Then there are five male blooddrinkers and five female blood drinkers. I like to use that phrase againand again. It sounds very yummy. Then there are eight yoginis, whichare called the gaurima gye, and then the eight tramen goddesses. Thetramen goddesses are depicted in the thangka paintings as havinghuman bodies, but with different kinds of heads, such as the heads ofdifferent types of birds, and so on. Then you have four female gate-keepers, and the twenty-eight ishvaris. That’s the sixty.It says very clearly in the tantras and the teachings that howeverthey may manifest, these forty-two and sixty deities are completelyself-arisen and self-appearing. They are the appearance of differentaspects of our own mind manifesting in these forms. They are not lit-eral. They are very symbolic teachings. We must learn the meaning ofeach symbol before we do the practice of Tantra. When you have ema-nations of buddha in the forms of different Tantric deities, one mustlearn each detail in order to understand them fully. It is very impor-tant in Tantra to fully understand the details before we even try torecite the mantra or perform any rituals. We must go into those detailsbefore we try to conceptualize who or what the deities are. Maybe these are not very important to you at this point. But if youread the Tibetan Book of the Dead in the future, it may be helpful. If youhappen to be in the bardo, it may be helpful to at least know who thepeaceful and wrathful deities are.

That unpleas-ant situation really clicks us into the state of truly understanding andappreciating impermanence. It clicks us into understanding shunyataand appreciating the notion of emptiness. That happens all the time. In a similar way, the wisdom of mind, which is the awakening heart,does not always work with this peaceful manifestation. We slip awayall the time. Sometimes the wrathful manifestations of buddhas orwisdoms really do the job.

We are making theaspiration that they obtain the ultimate wealth and the ultimate joy,which is the recognition of primordial buddha mind. That is our aspi-ration here. But our aspiration is not only to recognize this primordialground of buddhahood. Once we have recognized this ground, weaspire that such wisdom then expands and shines out. We aspire thatby recognizing this ground, the boundless wisdom of beings grows tothe infinite space of the universe. There are many different aspirations we can make. We can make rel-ative bodhicitta aspirations, saying, “May all sentient beings achievehappiness, be free from suffering and the causes of suffering,” and so86 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 86"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"forth. But this aspiration of Samantabhadra is not for relative bod-hicitta, it is for ultimate bodhicitta.

The Second Karmapa said that during his lifetime, at that verymoment, he had three emanations. One was somewhere else in centralTibet, another one was in China, and one was in eastern or westernTibet. It’s a living example of so many things that are expressed inSamantabhadra’s aspiration.

They manifest in whatever way they can in order totame the suffering of sentient beings. For example, it is said that thenext buddha, Maitreya Buddha, will not be a prince. He will be bornas a Brahmin. Without moving from this fundamental state of alpha-purity,through the manifestations of spontaneous luminosity and the com-passionate display of wisdom, Kuntuzangpo emanates unceasingmanifestations that are inconceivable in number. This clearly showsthat the emanations we spoke of, the five buddha families and the hun-dred different manifestations of buddha, are simply one very smallpart of Kuntuzangpo’s activity as buddha. Kuntuzangpo says veryclearly that he manifests in billions of universes as whatever serves thepurpose of benefiting sentient beings. If a particular manifestationwill release beings from their samsaric causes of confusion, then Kun-tuzangpo will arise in that form.

Rinpoche:On one level, Samantabhadra is making the aspiration thatall sentient beings experience the absolute reality where there’s non-dual awareness. We’re trying to experience that. The other level is thatSamantabhadra is making these aspirations in a relative world, throughrelative bodhicitta, through compassion and love, and through wordsand wisdom. We have a certain element of duality as soon as we start to open ourmouths and say some words. As soon as we start to think in a concep-tual way, there is a duality. But duality in the beginning is not badbecause we can’t be totally nondual right from the beginning. At the beginning, there has to be some sense of dualistic practice,such as compassion. When you practice compassion, it’s very dualis-tic. You look at sentient beings that are suffering and then you prac-tice compassion. You apply your bodhicitta, the six paramitas, and soforth in order to benefit those sentient beings, as well as yourself, onthe path. In that way, duality leads us to the nondual experience ofawareness. That aspect of the path of duality causes us to eventuallyexperience nondual awareness. Q:Can you give some recommendations for postmeditation?R:In the beginning, you should put some effort into your postmedi-tation practice. For example, you should try to remember to watchyour mind, watch your thoughts, at least once every hour. That’s verygood practice already. If you do it every hour, it is already a greatachievement. Later, that effort will bring the sense of effortless aware-ness in everyday life.I use a digital watch.

Then you say, “Oh, aggres-sion.” Or maybe there was a positive thought, whatever. You may saythat you are going to be mindful twenty-four hours a day, but that’snot possible. But if you say, “I am going to be mindful every time mywatch beeps,” that’s very possible. So every time it beeps, just look atyour mind. See what emotions you are going through. Continue tojust observe it as much as you can, as often as you can. If you forget,then your watch will remind you again. You can use other methods as well. If you are driving a lot, thenevery time someone honks at you, you can watch your mind instead ofshouting. I found that to be a nice method. It is certain that you willget angry when someone honks at you. If you watch your mind, youcan see your anger coming up. You observe it. In that way, it becomesmuch easier and simpler to deal with.

It is very much present. However, when we fail torecognize it, when it fails to recognize itself, the illusion begins. Thewhole of samsara manifests from that very moment of nonrecogni-tion. In a way, it is very simple. We search so much for the beginning of samsara. However, Bud-dha said many times that it is useless to search history to find it. Hesaid that there was not much benefit in knowing. Knowing when orhow samsara started is not going to really help us to undo it.

Even sci-entifically, it doesn’t help much. A big bang is a big bang. Logically speaking, the answer is to look at this very moment: sam-sara begins right here. We don’t have to trace back a hundred years, athousand years, or a hundred eons. We can trace back the beginning ofsamsara to this very moment. From the Tantric, Mahamudra, andDzogchen points of view, it is the beginning of our samsara and itcould be the end of our samsara. At this very moment, the basic stateof mind is intrinsically pure in that state of great clarity. However,we’re not seeing it. Instead, there is the continuous pattern of igno-rance and the other delusions that we have discussed. For whatever reason, it is arising right now. There is really no longway to go back to find the beginning of this ignorance that arises onthe basis of awareness. The text clearly says that not being mindful iswhat actually covers our awareness. Unmindfulness clouds our per-ception. In that state, we lose this basic luminosity. When we are in thestate of mindlessness, we lose this basic awareness. The failure to rec-ognize this ground awareness is the beginning of samsara, which is thesituation of unawareness. Logically speaking, that is why the begin-ning of samsara is right here. In Tibetan, it says rigpa rang tsuk ma thuppa rigpa, “rigpa has its owncharacteristics.” When we fail to recognize and rest in that originalstate, when rigpa is not resting in its own characteristics, the delusionsbegin. The basic ignorance here is not a conceptual ignorance. It is de -scribed as a state of unconsciousness. The obscurity of unconscious-ness arises when the ground is not completely manifest. It is a statethat lacks awareness. Losing our mindfulness is itself unawareness.94 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 94"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"That unawareness, which we call ignorance, is the beginning. It’s thatsimple. There is no awareness, no rigpa, when you’re totally uncon-scious. When there is no rigpa, the ground that is in the state of pri-mordial alaya does not manifest. That ignorance becomes the cause ofall our samsaric delusions. Therefore, it is the root of samsara. For thatreason, the Prayer says that the cause of bewildered ignorance is thisbasic unconsciousness. In that state of basic unconsciousness, nothing is clear. In that state,not even duality manifests. It is a very heavy state of mind. It is a deepstate of dullness, like torpor. In Tibetan, we have a saying to call some-one thom kyer, which means “completely spaced out,” “completelyblank,” “just sitting there.” It is much worse than couch potatoes.That same word is used here. In that state of unconsciousness that hasno awareness, even the clarity of duality is lacking. It completely lacksvividness. According to Dzogchen, this is the cause and beginning ofsamsara. From that unconsciousnessEmerged terrified, blurry cognition.Self-other and enmity were born from that.Now we can see that duality is coming. You know, good old dualityis not that old. From the basic state of unclarity, that sense of totallylacking vividness, arises a second phase of confusion. This secondphase is a terrifying experience. From that state of ignorance, concep-tions start to arise in a kind of terror. Then we project some things asself and some things as other. From that beginning, we start todevelop duality. There is some sense of fear arising at this point because you are notvery clear about the experience of clarity. The experience of the vividworld is arising, but you’re not sure of your relationship with it. In away, you can see that terror in the faces of babies when they’re just born. bewildered ignorance : 95Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 95"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"There is a sense of terror that arises when you come out of uncon-sciousness.

You don’t know exactlywhat time it is. You think it’s morning, but, when you look, the sun isjust setting or it is already dark. It is like going from that unconsciousstate to consciousness. There is always a mysterious experience in thatvery moment of switch. We’re not talking about a continuous experi-ence of five or ten minutes, that’s different. But in the very momentof waking up, you can feel that terror. There is some sense of fear, asense of loss in direction, in time, in reference point, in everything. So, this experience is nothing new. It seems to be something thatwe have experienced from the beginning of samsara. That’s how theprocess takes place. When we first wake up, there’s a blurry cognition,especially for those of us that need glasses! There’s no doubt about it:the first thing we do is grab our glasses. The experience of the terror, or the blurriness, comes from ourmind failing to take its own place. It is our mind lacking the strength,so to speak, to remain in its own state of primordial buddhahood.There is a sense of weakness in that very particular experience. Fromthere, we start our duality. The notion of self arises and, from thatnotion of self, the notion of other arises. From these two, we getcaught up in the notions of enmity, friendship, and so forth. Then thegood old samsaric game of duality begins to arise. Dualistic mind develops first from the dominating ignorance. Thisdominating ignorance is the fundamental ignorance that we havebeen speaking about. It is the basic ignorance that we miss right at thebeginning of every moment.

From this endless stream that we call karma, the samsaric solidityof suffering, of ego-clinging, and of poisonous emotions graduallyde velops. When that has developed, we end up in this solid existenceof samsara. The progression that ends up as the existence of samsarais basically the twelve nidanas, the twelve links of interdependentorigination. Beginning with ignorance, formation, and so forth, wehave the inner cycle of twelve interdependent nidanas. We also havethese twelve links in the outer sense: the twelve astrological cyclescalled the twelve months, the cycle of twelve years, and so on. Fromthe repetition of the twelve interdependent originations, we solidifyour hab itual inclinations and tendencies. In that way, we solidify oursamsara. We have the habitual tendency to delude our perception. We deludeour conception, our view, and our understanding. As a result of habit-ual tendencies, we are always caught up in this cyclic existence calledsamsara. We get caught in the continual cycle of the five poisons. Theunbroken continuity of habitual tendency, the unbroken continuityof the five poisons, is the existence of samsara. It is the only reason weare bound to this suffering. It is the only reason we are caught up inthis suffering. We learn here that samsara is nothing apart from ourhabitual delusion. According to Dzogchen, the five poisons are nothing but the man-ifestation of the luminosity of rigpa. They are called ö nga, the fiveluminous lights. The five luminous lights of rigpa are white, yellow,red, green, and, like the color of Kuntuzangpo, deep blue.Each of the five lights has meaning. The luminous white light ofwisdom is the manifestation of rigpa’s immaculate nature.

The red luminous light is the manifestation of the quality of rigpathat encompasses and magnetizes. Like a magnet, it draws all things inthat direction. In a similar way, that very nature of our mind calledrigpa encompasses all qualities, encompasses all wisdom. This meansthat everything is included within rigpa, nothing is left outside. That’swhy we have this magnetizing red light, which encompasses all thequalities. The difference between the yellow and the red light is that the yel-low light of enriching has the quality of possessing all the many dif-ferent elements of buddha wisdom, while the red light of magnetizingencompasses all these qualities that actually boil down to rigpa. It’srigpa that has all these qualities. So everything boils down to one andonly one essence. The single essence, which that contains all, is rigpa.It is the primordial mind, the primordial wisdom. The luminous green light means that rigpa manifests all the activitiesof buddha. Rigpa has the compassion, love, and wisdom that buddhasmanifest as physical activity, verbal activity, and samadhi, meditativeabsorption. All of these activities of buddha are complete within rigpa.Symbolizing that is the luminous green appearance of light, which isthe fourth light taught in Dzogchen. The fifth light is the deep luminous blue light that symbolizes theunchanging nature of rigpa. No matter what confusions we may expe-rience at this point, the true state of rigpa is beyond all confusion.

They can never cause it to change. The absolute state of ourmind is in the unchanging nature of rigpa, the unchanging nature ofthe buddha wisdom. Therefore, we have this luminous blue light.The five elements manifest from these five lights. The water ele-ment manifests from white light. The earth element manifests fromyellow light. The fire element manifests from red light. The wind ele-ment manifests from green light, and the space element manifestsfrom blue light. These are the five elements. From these five lights, the five objects of the five poisons also man-ifest. When we fail to recognize the five-colored luminosity of rigpamanifesting, we misperceive it. We misperceive the luminous whitelight of rigpa as ignorance. We misperceive the luminous yellow lightas pride. We misperceive the luminous red light as passion, desire, andattachment. We misperceive the luminous green light as jealousy, andwe misperceive the luminous blue light as aggression. We misperceivethese five luminous lights as the five poisons. According to Dzogchen teachings, the five luminous lights can bethe objects of the five poisons as well as the five poisons themselves.If you take them as the objects of the five poisons, then they corre-spond with the emotions as we have said. As the subjects of the fivepoisons, they are the five buddha families. Within the five buddhafamilies, ignorance is Vairochana; aggression is Akshobhya; pride isRatnasambhava; passion is Amitabha; and jealousy is Amoghasiddhi. Since they do exist in that nature, the Prayer says that samsarabegins as a result of the failure to recognize the true nature of the fivepoisons and their objects. Whenever these appearances of lights arise,these appearances of the five poisons, we can recognize them in theirtrue nature as the five buddha families. We can recognize them in thenature of the five buddha wisdoms. If we recognize them, it becomesliberation. Therefore, Samantabhadra makes this aspiration, saying,100 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 100"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Therefore, since the ground of the confusion of beingsIs mindless ignorance,Through the aspiration of myself, the buddha,May all recognize awareness.We have these five emotions within the five wisdoms. This is taughtin Vajrayana Buddhism in general and Dzogchen in particular. When-ever we have ignorance, it is in the nature of dharmadhatu wisdom.When we have aggression or irritation, that exists in the nature ofmirrorlike wisdom. When we have pride, that nature of mind exists inthe wisdom of equanimity. When we have passion, desire, or attach-ment, that mind exists in the nature of discriminating wisdom. Whenwe have jealousy or envy, it exists in the nature of all-accomplishingwisdom. Therefore, these five poisons remain in the five wisdoms ofbuddha. It is important to identify the emotion in which we are engaged,even though it is often mixed. Passion, aggression, jealousy, and so onare all mixed at certain points. Identifying them is the process thatnaturally takes us to mindfulness, to awareness. There is no other way. When we recognize an emotion, such as strong passion accompa-nied by jealousy, we are actually breaking down the speed of that emo-tion. The total sense of recognition is quite important in both Sutraand Tantra. In Sutra, it is mindfulness. In Tantra, if we see that natureand look at it nakedly, we will see the nature of that wisdom. You don’tneed to logically apply any reasoning. You don’t need to conceptuallymeditate on anything. Just simply recognize and observe it. Whetherit is dharmadhatu wisdom, mirrorlike wisdom, or any of the other fivewisdoms, you will see the nature of that wisdom. We will have theexperience of that wisdom by simply being with it without concep-tion. Therefore, recognition is quite important.The first step is just simply to observe it.

In the beginning, just to have an idea that it’s coming is very impor-tant and very effective. In the Vajrayana sense, the way to watch theseemotions is without stopping them. If we recognize the emotion andsay, “Yes, it is passion,” and then try to stop it, that’s a problem. Reject-ing our emotions is a problem in Vajrayana. Instead of trying to stop it, let it come. Invite it more. Look at thenature of passion more nakedly. Look at the nature of aggression, lookat the nature of ignorance, look at the nature of anything. Once wehave received the pointing-out instruction from our vajra master, weknow how to watch it. We know how to look at it. We don’t have toleave something behind and go to a certain place called “liberation.”That simple process of looking at it in every moment actually bringsliberation on the spot. Within that nature of passion is liberation,within that nature of aggression is liberation. If we know how to watch in that state, then we find the liberationwithin that passion. In the shamatha-vipashyana of Mahamudra prac-tice, there are the shamatha methods of calming the emotions and thevipashyana methods of watching our emotions. In the Dzogchen tra-dition, there are the methods of Trekchö to cut through the emotionsand the methods of Thögal to experience the luminosity of the emo-tion, of those states of mind. These things are details that we need tohave pointed out. Therefore, we’re making the aspiration for all beings to recognizetheir awareness because awareness is the primary nature of our minds.Lacking the recognition of awareness, we get into the delusion ofignorance and the whole wheel of samsara. This is the view of Dzog-chen. It’s simple, right? When we make this aspiration prayer of Samantabhadra, we do soremembering the nature of our five poisons.

Ground of ConfusionFrom the basic ignorance that we discussed earlier, we fall intoconnate, or co-emergent, ignorance. The connate ignoranceIs a distracted, mindless cognition.“Connate” is a better term than “co-emergent.” “Co-emergent” hasthe sense of two separate things merging into one, like two threadswoven together. “Connate” is more accurate because it’s one naturearising sim ultaneously. From that connate ignorance, the ignorance offalse imagination is developed, which is known as kundak. Kundak isthe ignorance of imputation. These are very helpful definitions of con-nate ignorance and of the labeling ignorance of false imagination.From these three ignorances, the dominating ignorance, the connateignorance, and the ignorance of false imagination, we get more andmore into the solid gross reality of duality.Samantabhadra says that connate ignorance is unconscious, un -mindful. It is unawareness. The dominating ignorance brings the con-nate ignorance, which arises simultaneously with our mind. Theconnate ignorance is together with every moment of our conscious-ness, with every moment of our awareness. We know it’s there, but,each moment, we fail to recognize it. Right now we are saying to our-Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 104"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"selves that we must recognize it, but the next moment we miss itagain. And the next moment we say that to ourselves again. And then,the next moment, we miss it again. This repetitive failure to recognizethe dominating ignorance is the connate ignorance. The connate ignorance is actually the nature of not recognizing. Atthe very moment of not being aware, as one’s consciousness is totallyignorant, pristine awareness is very much present. At the very momentI have a tremendous sense of emotion, it exists within the basic stateof rigpa, the pristine awareness. This is what we call connate. In thatvery moment of experiencing ignorance, it is already in the nature ofalpha-pure wisdom. It’s not really arising at the same time; the alpha-pure wisdom is its basic nature. The nature of ignorance is the same asthe nature of wisdom. It’s always there. This nature of ignorance is theunawareness. Every moment of consciousness arises together with that dominat-ing ignorance. Ignorance and awareness are together at this point. Ifawareness were not present when the ignorance is present, then theawareness would not be the fundamental nature of mind. Accordingto the text, these two are simultaneous at this point. So, awareness andignorance are the two elements we are talking about as being co-emer-gent. They are awareness, rigpa, and ignorance, ma rigpa. Connate ignorance is not the ordinary notion of distraction. It isnot hearing a sound and then getting distracted to it, or seeing animage and getting distracted to that. We’re not talking about a causeof distraction here. We are talking about a very subtle distraction frombasic awareness. That distraction is described as mindless cognition.Just being mindless itself is a distraction. That’s the most subtle dis-traction we ever experience in our meditation path. Usually, we think of distraction as being something very active. Wethink of it as a dualistic interaction between an outside object and oneof the six sensory perceptions. But distraction here is simply beingground of confusion : 105Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 105"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"unmindful, being unaware. This distraction refers to the basic sense ofunconsciousness that we discussed earlier. This connate ignorance isnot conceptual mind. It is the fundamental ignorance. According to Tantra, that very co-emergence is unborn. It is non-existent. It is in the nature of rigpa. It is completely pure in the natureof kadak. From rigpa’s point of view, there is no such connate igno-rance. From the point of view of sentient beings, we have this inbornor connate ignorance when we don’t recognize rigpa.The labeling ignoranceIs holding self and other to be two.Because of the connate ignorance, we develop the ignorance of falseimagination. The ignorance of false imagination, which is sometimescalled the ignorance of imputations, experiences the display of one’sown manifestation of rigpa as something other than rigpa itself. Wesee the manifestation as other and interact with it in that way. At thispoint, we are beginning to go through the process of labeling, theprocess of conceptualization, and the process of imagination. For example, we sometimes label the appearance of luminosity inour mind as enemy, sometimes as friend. Actually, we are simply expe-riencing our own imagination. What we see in our mind is not the per-son we are thinking about; it’s our concept, our own thought. So theenemy is right within us. There is nothing outside. It is within us atthe most basic level. At the level of rigpa, that very concept of enemyis the luminosity element of mind. The luminosity is misconceived assome outer element, as an enemy somewhere outside. The co-emergent ignorance is the basis for the labeling and forimputations. It’s like the canvas on which we paint different images.We must first have the canvas in order to create any image, in order toproject or paint any of our creativity. The labeling ignorance is like thebasic painting itself. We always talk about the co-emergent and label-106 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 106"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"ing ignorances in Madhyamaka logic and in buddha nature theories. Itis common to the Cittamatrin, the Madhyamaka, and the Vajrayanaview. The labeling process is very subtle. Even though we are character-izing the ignorance of false imagination as one process, it has manydifferent layers. We usually have so many labeling processes going on,so many chains of thoughts. We say, “Passion is good, we should havepassion.” That labeling processes is not very enlightening. It’s notemotion itself. It’s not thought itself. We are grouping all these label-ing processes as one at this point. The labeling process is a very subtleway of planting and growing this seed of ignorance in our mind-stream.This ignorance is connected to the five luminous lights that we mis-perceive as objects. Therefore, this ignorance is called the false imagi-nation. As it says here, the most gross element of this ignorance is thedivision between self and other. The labeling process has matured tothe stage where we can clearly see the dualistic barrier. That is the finalstage of this ignorance.The two ignorances, connate and labeling,Are the ground of the confusion of all beings.Because of these, we get involved in passion, aggression, and igno-rance. As a result of those actions, we fall further into ignorance. Everyillusion of samsara arises from this simple duality. Whether it’s suffer-ing, pain, or happiness, everything arises from ignorance. The Prayersays that the connate and labeling ignorances are the ground of theconfusion of all beings. They are the bases, the fundamental causes ofall samsaric illusions. These three ignorances, the dominating ignorance, the connateignorance, and the ignorance of false imagination, are accompanied byfour conditions. First, there is the causal condition. The causal condi-ground of confusion : 107Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 107"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"tion is not recognizing the manifestation of ground. It is not recog-nizing that the manifestations arise from the basic ground of lumi-nosity, the basic ground of rigpa, the basic ground of the naked natureof our mind. The second condition is called the objective condition. It is thiscondition through which these delusions arise. When the manifesta-tions of rigpa arise as luminous, we confuse them as objects of sam-saric perception, of ignorant perception. That is the objectivecondition.The third condition is called the dominating condition. The domi-nating condition is our ego-clinging. Good old ego-clinging becomesthe basic dominating factor, the dominating condition. The fourth condition is called the instantaneous or immediate con-dition. It refers to the co-emergent nature of these three conditionstogether. The causal condition, the objective condition, and the dom-inating condition arising together is called the instantaneous orimmediate condition. When the three ignorances and the four condi-tions come together, then we get the illusion of samsara.The aspiration at this point is very beautiful:Through the aspiration of myself, the buddha, May the thick, mindless obscurity Of all samsaric beings be dispelled.May dualistic cognition be clarified. May awareness be recognized.There is an expression in English, “thick-skulled.” Samsaric beingsare sometimes like that. They are thick-skulled. “All samsaric beings”includes ourselves. We don’t have any openness to the idea of nirvanaor liberation. We don’t get enlightenment because we don’t reallywant it. According to Buddhist teachings, the resistance is coming from108 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 108"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"clinging on to our ego. Ego, our very old friend, has been so close tous for millions of years. We have shared our space with this old friendso much that at this point we have totally lost our sense of true exis-tence, true nature. We have misidentified ourselves with this ego.It is not an easy decision to kick this friend out of our room, out ofour space, right now. On one hand, part of our mind is saying, “I reallywant to kick this friend out because it has been causing me a lot ofpain.” On the other hand, we are still attached to it because it is so closethat it has almost become ourself.The root of our problem of not being willing to achieve enlighten-ment is this: we can’t let go of our ego-clinging. The way to overcomethis is to see that ego has never given us any positive results. If we cansee that, then we can develop more renunciation of ego and morerenunciation of samsara. Then we can really kick this friend out fromour space.On the spiritual path, we see the possibility of freedom. We see thepossibility of finally getting a sense of liberation from these irritatinghabitual tendencies. They are not fun anymore. Maybe it’s fun to go toMcDonald’s once or twice. The third time is not really fun, but we arehabituated, so we go back. We are disgusted with this. There is no easy way. If anyone says it’s easy and that we don’t needdiligence, it’s not true. Everything needs a certain element of dili-gence, of exertion. With diligence and exertion, we can reach a pointwhere effort becomes effortless. However, at the beginning we needto exert ourselves. In order to exert ourselves, we need discipline.That’s why the paramita practices are so practical. The paramita prac-tices are common to both Tantra and Sutra. We can begin with disci-pline, which is the cause of diligence, and discipline enforces ourdiligence. Diligence doesn’t come without renunciation and withoutseeing the possibility of freedom. Therefore, they are all connected.So making this aspiration and saying, “May the thick, mindlessobscurity of all samsaric beings be dispelled” is very beautiful.

We reflect on the nature of rigpa aswell as its manifestation, and then we make these very simple aspira-tions of Samantabhadra.Question:Is the difference between the dominant and the co-emer-gent ignorance a difference in time?Rinpoche:The dominant ignorance is at the beginning. It is no wonderthat it is difficult to see because it happens pretty early. When it’s firstarising, one does not see that arisal. The co-emergent ignorance arisesin every moment of awareness. It is more like the continuity of thatdominant ignorance. On the one hand, they’re very similar: they areall in the same nature of ignorance. It is like when we talk about thefive wisdoms of the buddha. On the one hand, you cannot separatethem as they are all similar. On the other hand, they have slightly dif-ferent qualities. Q:Which comes first, karma or ignorance?R: The dominant ignorance leads to the karmic cycle. Because of thisignorance, you have karma. Because of karma, your ignorance getsstronger. It covers the rigpa more. The sequence begins with igno-rance in Tantra as well as in Sutra. For example, the twelve nidanasbegin with ignorance. Because of ignorance, we commit wrong actionssuch as harming oneself or others. Therefore, ignorance comes first inthe sequence. Because we have gone through the cycle of the twelve nidanas somany times, often we feel that it comes from karma. Because of this,we have further ignorance and go around the loop again. So the cycle110 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 110"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"begins with ignorance, which can be intensified further with negativekarma. Q: You said that ego was a bad friend, but isn’t the kind of friendshipwe make with our emotions really the question?R: Of course, it is fine to have different understandings and differentviews. However, I don’t think we need jealousy, for example, to obtainwisdom. Jealousy is one of the very difficult emotions to overcome. Itcan be very destructive. At the same time, we need to have a certain ele-ment of emotion to go beyond emotions. Therefore, at the beginning,we do not completely deny the emotions. That’s why bodhisattvas do not relinquish one element of desire.They need it to come back to samsara in order to benefit sentientbeings. Therefore, they keep a certain element of passion, which istransformed by compassion. So, there are certain elements of emo-tions that are needed, but not really jealousy. Perhaps you are talking about ambition rather than jealousy, likesaying, “I want to be like Shakyamuni Buddha and the previous bud-dhas,” or, “I want to be enlightened like all the other enlightenedbeings.” In the beginning, that kind of ambition is very important. It’snot bad. It is transcended later on the path. Maybe jealousy is helpfulin some ways. Perhaps you work harder, you become more diligent onthe path, because your colleagues are improving faster. In that sense,maybe jealousy is beneficial sometimes. Let me speak a little about the relationship with ignorance. Thebasic view is that ignorance has always been a problem, ego has alwaysbeen a problem. That’s why we look at ego as the cause of suffering inthe basic sense. As we have been discussing, ignorance is in the natureof Vairochana Buddha. The relationship changes: ignorance is notreally bad at that point. The nature of ignorance is in Vairochana Bud-ground of confusion : 111Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 111"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"dha. The nature of that ignorance is dharmadhatu wisdom. The natureof that ignorance is the embodiment of the buddha’s body. Differentlevels of the Buddhist path have different approaches to that relation-ship. Therefore, we may say that the relationship changes. The mostfundamental view of Buddhism is that it is important for us to developthe desire for enlightenment at the beginning.When anyone speaks about dharma, he is simply reflecting his view,his opinion, his understanding. So, when I talk about the Samanta-bhadra prayer, I’m speaking from my understanding, my training, mypractice, and my experience. This is what I feel, what I think. This isvery important for us to understand. It’s the same with every subject. The absolute thing is something that we should realize. It is some-thing that we have to taste, to experience, and then say, “Ah, this is it.”I think it is important for us not to take any speaker’s view as anabsolute authority. There is no such absolute authority. If you take anyspeaker as an absolute authority, then that would be Shakyamuni Bud-dha. It would be Buddha’s speech, his teachings. So we may, to a cer-tain degree, take anything that Buddha taught in the Buddhist canonas absolute authority. Other than that, we always say, “This is Nagar-juna’s view” or “This is Asanga’s view.” That’s very important. 112 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 112"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Part SixçDualismDualism is doubt.From the emergence of subtle clingingCoarse habit gradually develops.Food, wealth, clothing, places, companions, The five desirables, and beloved relatives—Beings are tormented by attachment to the pleasant.That is mundane confusion.There is no end to the actions of dualism.When the fruit of clinging ripens,Born as pretas tormented by craving—How sad is their hunger and thirst.Through the aspiration of myself, the buddha,May desirous beings Not reject the longing of desireNor accept the clinging of attachment.By relaxing cognition as it isMay their awareness take its seat.May they attain the wisdom of discrimination.Through the emergence of a subtle, fearful cognitionOf externally-apparent objects The habit of aversion grows.Coarse enmity, beating, and killing are born.Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 113"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"When the fruit of aversion ripens,How much suffering there is in hell through boiling and burning.Through the aspiration of myself, the buddha,When strong aversion arisesIn all beings of the six states,May it be relaxed without rejection or acceptance.Awareness taking its seat,May beings attain the wisdom of clarity.One’s mind becoming inflated,An attitude of superiority to others,Fierce pride, is born.One experiences the suffering of disputation.When the fruit of that action ripens,One is born as a god and experiences death and downfall.Through the aspiration of myself, the buddha,May beings with inflated minds Relax cognition as it is.Awareness taking its seat,May they realize equality.Through the habit of developed dualism,From the agony of praising oneself and denigrating others,Quarrelsome competitiveness develops.Born as an asura, killed and mutilated,One falls to hell as a result.Through the aspiration of myself, the buddha,May those who quarrel through competitivenessRelax their enmity.Awareness taking its seat,May they attain the wisdom of unimpeded activity.114 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 114"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Through the distraction of mindless apathy,Through torpor, obscurity, forgetfulness, Unconsciousness, laziness, and bewilderment,One wanders as an unprotected animal as a result.Through the aspiration of myself, the buddha,May the light of lucid mindfulness ariseIn the obscurity of torpid bewilderment.May nonconceptual wisdom be attained.All beings of the three realmsAre equal to myself, the buddha, in the all-ground.It became the ground of mindless confusion.Now, they engage in pointless actions.The six actions are like the bewilderment of dreams.I am the first buddha.I tame the six types of beings through emanations.Through the aspiration of Samantabhadra,May all beings without exception Be awakened in the dharmadhätu.dualism : 115Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 115"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 116"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"?Attachment to PleasureThe Prayer continueswith verses that relate to the differentpoisons of the mind.

From that subtle attachment develops the gross, intense,habitual clinging and habitual tendencies. Therefore, Samantabhadrabegins by talking about the progression of this poison.For example, you begin smoking by just doing it once. It’s so inno-cent, it doesn’t really matter. Out there with your friends there are norestrictions from rigpa, so you feel free. That one samsaric smoke leadsto a second, which leads to a third. In the beginning, it’s just the mech-anism.

For exam-ple, a lot of people get shocked when you ask a monk or a nun whetherhe or she gets attracted to the opposite sex. People get really shocked ifthe answer is “Yes, I honestly do have this attraction.” They say, “Howcan he or she have this?!” Actually, that’s why he or she is a monastic. Itis to try to overcome that desire. If any monastic says he or she doesn’thave that desire or craving, it’s a lie, unless he or she is a buddha or anarhat. We should not misjudge such things. It is very important to seethat we all are going through these torments of lust, desire, and attach-ment, whether we are lay people or monastic, rich or poor. We all gothrough this, whatever level we are at and whatever state we are in. Therefore, Samantabhadra says that we have attachment. We haveattachment to food, wealth, clothing, home, companions, and lovingfriends. We have attachment to the five desirable sensory experiences,which are the objects of the five sensory perceptions. We are attachedto beautiful forms, beautiful sounds, beautiful smells, beautiful tastes,and beautiful tactile sensations. So the first thing that is dealt with here is attachment or desire.Attachment is actually the greatest suffering of all sentient beings. Itis a little bit harder to recognize that because we always think suffer-ing and pain come from hatred, anger, aggression, and so forth. Butwhen you look at the suffering in the world, the suffering that arisesfrom attachment is the worst. If you ask how many people have beenhurt through aggression, through hatred, through some kind of fightor physical pain, there may be only a few. But if we ask how many ofus have been hurt by passion, by attachment, or by desire, then all ofus have been hurt—and not only once! We have all been hurt contin-uously by such desire and attachment.attachment to pleasure : 119Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 119"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Because beings are tormented by attachment to the pleasant, Shan-tideva said that samsaric pleasure is like honey on a razor blade.

That is mundane confusion.There is no end to the actions of dualism.This means that our perceptions of the objects of the five sensoryperceptions, as well as our conceptual experiences, are simply delu-sion. It’s saying that they are all delusion, which is illusion. It’s simplyour mind. There is nothing called beautiful outside. Even in our mun-dane wisdom, we have the saying that beauty lies in the eye of thebeholder. Usually, we’ve been very successful in ignoring that wis-dom. That success leads to endless exhaustion, like being a successfullawyer. 120 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 120"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"?Fruit of ClingingHaving discussedhow this basic ignorance develops into thepoisonous mindstream that leads to different sufferings,Samantabhadra says,When the fruit of clinging ripens,Born as pretas tormented by craving—How sad is their hunger and thirst.When the poison of mind called “attachment” or “desire” arises,the result is that we carry out many different actions. But it’s not sim-ply craving or desire, the main emotion here is passion, attachment.With that attachment, we commit actions of aggression, jealousy,pride, and so forth. Such actions bring the result of a lower birth. One can cling to material objects as well as emotions. Clinging onto something, and not being able to let go, becomes a cause for takingbirth in the state of a preta, a hungry ghost. In the hungry ghost realm,there is a continuous struggle. It is usually depicted with images of dif-ferent tortured spirits. The hungry ghost realm is a tremendously claustrophobic situationof psychological torture. It is filled with the pain of hunger and thirst,which refers to an extreme poverty mentality. No matter how muchyou have, no matter how much you possess, you still feel incomplete.Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 121"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"You still feel hunger, thirst, and desire. If we become too attached, ifthere is too much strong clinging to our objects of desire, the negativeresult of such clinging can become the experience of the hungry ghostrealm.You can see that in the stock market. One minute, a hundred thou-sand dollars is not enough. Then a million is not enough, then a bil-lion, and it goes on and on. One day, the market crashes and you’re leftwith nothing, not even enough to pay your rent and utility bills. It’slike the experience of the hungry ghost realm. Too much desire, toomuch attachment and clinging, too much extreme poverty mentalityor extreme dissatisfaction can lead us to the experience of this hungryghost state. This realm is an endless journey of desire. In this realm, you areunable to utilize whatever it may be that you possess. You are unableto use even one percent of it. In that very moment, you are still look-ing for something else, more and more and more and more. In the hungry ghost realm, we build up a habitual tendency of cling-ing, of miserliness, of stinginess. Craving involves clinging on to some-thing and not being able to let go. For example, we usually don’t wantto give happiness. We want to hold on to it. If you have some posses-sion that you feel stingy about, you hold on to it, which builds upanother habit. The habit is a mechanical process. We develop that same tendencyof holding on to something, whether it is to good things like happi-ness or to bad things such as anger and jealousy. At a certain point, weunknowingly develop this mechanistic sense of clinging. Desire goesto the root of our bad tendencies. We are not willing to let go of ourbad tendencies because of this hunger, this desire. We are not willingto let go because of the clinging.One aspect of the hungry ghost mentality is strongly present inhuman consciousness. Buddha said that one of the sufferings in thehuman realm is the poverty mentality, which is one of the biggest122 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 122"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"problems in the hungry ghost realm as well. This poverty mentality isvery natural for human beings. Because the poverty mentality is very dangerous, it is important forus to recognize and work with it. If we fail to work with it, we bringthe same mundane hang-ups and neuroses on our spiritual journey.When we are on this spiritual journey, we must be aware of the pov ertymentality and overcome it. As the saying goes, the grass is alwaysgreener on the other side of the fence. When we look out of our win-dow, we see our neighbor’s pasture as much greener than ours. So webuy that neighbor’s backyard. Then we see the next neighbor’s yardand now that one looks better. We can do that same thing in our spiritual journey. When we arepracticing according to one lineage, or when we are practicing onemethod of meditation, then another looks better. If we are doingshamatha meditation, then vipashyana always looks better. Ngöndro,the preliminary practices of Vajrayana, always looks like a much higherand nicer practice when we are doing shamatha. So we try to jump tovipashyana or to ngöndro, and then, again, it’s the same. Those vipash -yana people look much nicer. They look as if they are progressingmuch better. So we flip back to vipashyana. When we are practicingMahamudra, then Dzogchen always looks much greener. So we jumpto Dzogchen. And again, it’s the same. Our neurosis is still there andso Mahamudra again looks much greener. It’s a never-ending back andforth journey that leads to endless exhaustion. Therefore, workingwith this poverty mentality is very important in the spiritual journey. When we have one good master, another one always looks kinder.The other one always looks much more skilled, much more intelli-gent, and so on. Then we flip back and forth with our teachers, thesame as we do with everything else. That is the totally chaotic pathcalled the hungry ghost realm.Working with that poverty mentality is a way to transcend thetre mendous psychological torture of a hungry ghost. It is a way tofruit of clinging : 123Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 123"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"transcend the torture of endless desire, endless passion, and endlessneed. The suffering of a hungry ghost, that endless wanting, is no sat-isfaction. In classical Buddhist paintings, the hungry ghosts are sitting rightnext to a beautiful lake while, at the same time, they are burning insidewith thirst. Even while they burn inside with thirst, they have thisstinginess. They think that the water will be completely consumed ifthey drink, so they never drink. It is said that even if the hungry ghostsdrink, they burn inside even more because they worry about losingthis wealth of water. If we are not mindful, this hungry ghost psycho-logical state can happen to us at any time. Therefore Samantabhadrasays,Through the aspiration of myself, the buddha, May desirous beings Not reject the longing of desireNor accept the clinging of attachment.Our prayer is that all sentient beings suffering through the causes oflust, passion, attachment, or desire neither suppress them nor go undertheir power. Whenever lust, passion, attachment, or desire arises, themethod given here is not to reject these emotions. It is to let themcome, let them arise. There is no need to suppress this emotion. There is nothing wrongwith its appearance. The raw energy of lust and passion is in the stateof buddha wisdom. The Prayer says that whenever they arise, weshould not go under the power of the labeling process, the power ofconceptualizing the raw energy of lust and passion. We go through this experience of tremendous energy called pas-sion. What usually happens is that we conceptualize it later. That con-ceptualization leads us into an endless chain of thoughts and anendless chain of labeling. That endless chain of thoughts and labeling124 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 124"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"leads us to all sorts of different emotions, such as anger and jealousy,that become problematic. The method is not to go into that chain of the repetitive actions ofour emotions and conceptualizations. Just simply experience theemotion, neither reject it nor accept it. The raw energy is simply expe-rienced without any thought, without any labeling process. Just sim-ply be in that space. The Prayer says that this brings the wisdom ofperfect discernment, discriminating wisdom, which corresponds tothe wisdom of the western buddha field of Amitabha.The great Indian yogi Saraha said that an agitated mind, if left alone,becomes peaceful. The problem here is not the passion. It is not thelust nor is it the desire. The problem is that we are not leaving themalone. We are not letting them be what they are. We are disturbingthem with the labeling process, the thought process. We are not let-ting lust be lust, we are not letting desire be desire, we are not lettingpassion be passion. Therefore, the mind becomes agitated. Not rejecting the longing of desire is very important. The point isthat after seeing the faults of desire, after seeing the negative impactof clinging, attachment, and passion, we sometimes go to the otherextreme of completely rejecting desire. Rejecting here refers to thepath of Hinayana, where there is a sense of completely running awayfrom the pleasures of samsaric passion, samsaric desire, and samsaricjoy. When practitioners of the Hinayana see pleasures, they get theHinayana monastic tremble. When they see beautiful fruit, they darenot pick it up. Rejecting desire in a Hinayana way is running away from desire. Itis practiced through reflecting on the faults and negative aspects ofdesire such as the meditation on ugliness, impermanence, and soforth. Rejecting desire in a Mahayana way is based on emptiness. It ispracticed through transcending desire, transcending attachment,through the meditation of bodhicitta, and what we call juma dapu tingnge dzin, illusionlike samadhi. fruit of clinging : 125Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 125"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Bodhisattvas see all relative experiences as illusion, as a dreamlikemirage. They sometimes accept desire, passion, and other emotions,but they do so by way of seeing it as illusion. It is acceptance in a tran-scendent way by seeing it as egoless passion or egoless attachment.There is a certain sense of rejecting its rawness, which is the rugged-ness of emotions. Therefore, rejecting here has two aspects, theHinayana element of complete rejection and the Mahayana element ofrejection that involves the notion of transcendence. In the Vajrayana path, we sometimes pursue an aspect of the paththat accepts desire, accepts passion, and accepts attachment. There arepractices of intentionally generating passion and purposely activatingattachment. These practices give rise to desire and passion as part ofthe Vajrayana path. It is said that the more powerfully you give rise topassion, the more powerfully the experience of great bliss manifestsfrom the Vajrayana point of view. The Vajrayana idea is that right whenthe forest begins to burn, the wind becomes an aid to the fire.Samantabhadra’s aspiration is that sentient beings neither rejectdesire in such an extreme way nor accept the clinging of attachment. By relaxing cognition as it isMay their awareness take its seat.The Dzogchen point of view says that intentionally generating pas-sion, attachment, or desire is not necessary. The Dzogchen way ofdealing with our desire is to relax cognition as it is. Relaxing our mindin that passion, just as it is, is like the Mahamudra approach. It is justresting in that fundamental experience of passion. In Dzogchen, the notion of passion as being something either to berejected or accepted does not exist. At this level, the basic state of pas-sion itself, the basic state of the mind of attachment and desire itself,is in the complete state of enlightenment. The aspiration here is to justlet it rest in its own state. Letting awareness take its seat in desire is126 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 126"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"good enough. Just face the raw energy of desire nakedly without theelaborations of the Hinayana, Mahayana, or Vajrayana. The simplicityof just simply resting, simply being in it completely and fully, is thekey to liberation from the Dzogchen point of view. Therefore, we’remaking these aspirations, saying, May they attain the wisdom of discrimination.The wisdom of discrimination is the nature of passion here. Itshows the nature of the emotion and the nature of Dzogchen practice.It also shows where emotion leads if we get caught up in it: it leads tothe realm of pretas. You can leave it in its own state, whatever it is, and simply experi-ence that. Then, as it says, let awareness take its seat. This means it isjust going back to its natural state. You are simply letting it be what itis, which is in the nature of rigpa.If one knows how to rest in this state of passion, one can attain lib-eration. We are making aspiration prayers in order that all sentientbeings, including ourselves, attain this state of rigpa and the wisdomof perfect discernment. That is our prayer here.The teachings concerning the other poisons are given in the samepattern as this. They change the poison, the realm, and the wisdom.Other than that, they deal with each emotion in exactly the same way. fruit of clinging : 127Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 127"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"?Fruit of AversionThe next aspirationconcerns aggression:Through the emergence of a subtle, fearful cognitionOf externally-apparent objects The habit of aversion grows.Coarse enmity, beating, and killing are born.When the fruit of aversion ripens,How much suffering there is in hell through boiling and burning.Even better! We are not just talking about aggression alone. All ofthe other emotions are included, such as passion, jealousy, and soforth. But the mature poison of the mind discussed here is aggression. The Prayer says that our basic fear is the fear of losing. In the begin-ning, we develop a subtle fear towards certain external appearancesthat we experience in everyday life, such as our pride, our name, or ourposition. It is a subtle fear of the apparent object outside gaining morepower, more wealth, a higher position or job. This fear is connected toour basic pride and basic jealousy. Of course, pride and jealousy willcome later, but all emotions are connected through this fear. Passionis connected to aversion, aversion is connected to passion, and soforth. There’s an interrelationship between them. From that fear, the habit of aversion grows. Ego’s fundamental fear,which we all have in samsara, is the beginning of our aggression.

From that, more and more hatreddevelops. In order to achieve and defend the ego-centered view, aggressionbecomes very powerful. It is a great tool for ego to secure its fear. Thatis the primary use of aggression. This again leads us into habitual ten-dencies, just like passion. When aggression leads to the gross elementof fear, it becomes very gross physical violence, verbal violence, andmental violence. Body, speech, and mind become very violent. From that violent mind comes violent action. Violent action leadsone to the resultant stage of hatred. In Buddhism, the resultant stageof hatred is called the hell realm. The emotion of aggression or aver-sion leads us to the state of the hell realm, or the hell-of-a-realm. Thisrealm is depicted by the iconography of burning and boiling. Theiconography should not be taken literally, it is just a symbol. Withinthat basic symbol, there are two elements of suffering, hot and cold.Among the two, the hot burning element is emphasized because it ismore connected to aggression and hatred.According to the Mahayana and Vajrayana views, all of these realmsare very much psychological. In both the Mahayana sutras and theVajrayana tantras, they are spoken about as being very much ourminds, very much our mental states. We are the creator of these statesas well as the experiencer of these states. They are all symbolic in Bud-dhism. There is no outside entity ruling over the hell realm. There isno Lord of Death giving commands and making you suffer. Such expe-riences arise from aggression, the emotion of anger. Our great Indian master Shantideva said, “Who has created this hotand burning ground of a hell realm? Who is making this fire, this eter-nal fire of the hell realm?” He said that there is no outer creator of thehell realm. It has no outer existence. As the Buddha said, it is all a cre-ation of your mind. The pain that we see in the hell realm is the cre-ation of our mind. From these statements, we can clearly see that thefruit of aversion : 129Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 129"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"hell realm is a psychological trauma. It’s a state where we get com-pletely claustrophobic. We get totally burned in this fire of aggres-sion. Shantideva said that when your mind is disturbed, agitated by thispoison of aggression, it is eternally burning. You can’t sleep, even atnight, because your mind is disturbed by this anger, by this hatred. Youcan’t concentrate during the day, on your work or on your meditation,because your mind is still burning. This eternal fire of aggression isgoing on. Shantideva said that you are in the psychological trauma ofa hell realm when you give birth to this aggression. The aggression causes us to burn and boil ourselves until webecome completely exhausted. We do this until we literally fall apart.We don’t need a literal fire to burn, we don’t need literal water to boil.Psychologically, we are burned and boiled with anger, with hatred,with aggression. That state of psychological pain is caused by aggres-sion. Therefore, the hell realm image in Buddhism is the image of theintense pain of aggression.Anger has an object that is disturbing. If something is disturbing,we usually want to move it away. For example, if something is dis-turbing on the television, we want to flip to another channel. Shanti-deva says that it is impossible to destroy your object of anger outside.But if you conquer just one enemy, your aggression, it is like con-quering all the objects of this anger. It is conquering the whole enemygroup. It is like covering the soles of your feet with leather. You don’thave to cover the whole world with leather so that you can walk bare-foot on it, just wear shoes. If you cover your feet with leather, it is likecovering the whole world. If you want to destroy an object, lookinside and find the true enemy, which is aggression. Conquer that.Shantideva said that anger is very destructive. He said that onemoment of hatred or anger can destroy the virtue of many eons. Manymillions of years of virtue can be destroyed by one moment of anger.So anger seems to be a pretty dangerous emotion. It is like a very130 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 130"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"destructive computer virus. It wipes out all the data that you havebeen working on for years. We may have done virtuous work on ourcomputer for many days, months, and years. But if our computer is notproperly backed up with bodhicitta, the heart of enlightenment, thenthe virtue gets destroyed by this moment of anger. Similarly, onemoment of anger, aggression, or hatred can wipe out the data of all thevirtuous actions.If you look at a very tiny moment of hatred, it is very destructive.Destructive here does not really refer to others. Obviously, it would beharmful to have thoughts of hatred toward those surrounding you,but it is much more harmful to yourself than to any other person.Hatred, whether it is towards oneself or others, becomes very intense,very torturous, and very claustrophobic. This psychological state iscalled the hell realm. It is basically a hell of an experience.For this reason, and from the earlier statements of Shantideva, wecan clearly understand that the hell realm is nothing outside this veryparanoid mind that we have. It is nothing outside our very violent andaggressive mind that is full of hatred. Therefore, when we becometotally engaged in emotions such as hatred or anger, we experience ahell realm.This is important for us to understand. The Mahayana and Vajrayanaviews say that whatever we experience, whatever we perceive, is basi-cally our own creation. There is no outer creation and no outer cre-ator. The creator is right here. If we are seeing nice beautiful scenery,it is our own creation. If we are seeing a horrible world outside or ahorrible experience inside, it is also our creation. It is our mind’s expe-rience. This is a very important element in these teachings. To look at an example of how it becomes our own creation, how itdoes not really reflect the true reality of the outside world, considerhow things are when we fall in love. In the beginning, everything iswonderful when we look at that person. The way they appear is sobeautiful. The clothes that they wear are so beautiful, so well-fitting.fruit of aversion : 131Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 131"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Whatever perfume they may be wearing is such a refreshing scent.Even when we see that person crying, it is still a beautiful sound.

He or she may be wearing the same clothes that they wore afew months ago, or ten years ago, but they don’t look so good. Theyare putting on the same perfume, but we have developed an allergy.

It’s worse than crying was in thebeginning. It may be the same hairstyle, the same clothing, the sameperfume, and the same words, but it’s perceived so differently. This is called mind-only experience. In Buddhism, when we talkabout mind-only, it doesn’t mean that the other person doesn’t exist.What we are saying is that the way we perceive, the way we relate, theway we see phenomena, is very much our mind only. It is our creation.We are projecting outside and we are perceiving that projection. It’svery much our perception only. It is our conception only.

One’s mind becoming inflated,An attitude of superiority to others,Fierce pride, is born.One experiences the suffering of disputation.When the fruit of that action ripens,One is born as a god and experiences death and downfall.In this case, pride and arrogance are our problem. In Buddhism,pride and arrogance begin with the simple notion of ego-clinging.The notion of “I,” that very basic clinging on to oneself as the self ofperson, is called pride. We can see that from the basic fundamental ignorance we havealready developed the seed of pride. No matter how much we are incontrol of our pride, we still have it. We cannot deny that we havepride. Even if we say, “I don’t have pride. I am very low-key, and I’mvery moderate, blah blah blah,” there is still strong pride. It is important to be aware of this emotion called pride. It is verydangerous and destructive because it causes us to refrain from learn-Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 134"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"ing. It blocks us from improving ourselves. Having pride means theend of our growing, the end of our development. Whenever we havepride in our practice or study of dharma, that’s the end of any devel-opment in that particular practice, or that particular knowledge. Wehave a saying in Tibetan, “If the pot is upside down, no matter howmuch water you try to pour in, you can’t fill it.” The water touches thepot, but just rolls off by the nature of it being upside down. It will noteven seep in. In this way, pride becomes quite destructive in our spir-itual journey as well as in our mundane development of wisdom. When one’s mind becomes inflated with different relative qualitiesof pride, we develop an attitude problem. Because of this pride, thisarrogance, we have an attitude of superiority to others. Therefore,there is nothing more to learn. That is the definition of pride; an atti-tude of superiority to others. We get into the suffering of disputationbecause we feel superior. For that reason, rivalry is created. Quarrelingand fighting with others is created from pride. We always have the sense of seeing others’ faults. Actually, we thinkwe see someone’s faults. We think that we are doing better than some-one else and that we see his or her problem. Then, naturally, we getinto disputation. It is exactly the same for everyone. As much as I amthinking like that while looking at someone, the other person is doingthe same thing while looking at me! So there is naturally a clashbetween two individual beings. There is no doubt about it. If it’s onlyin one direction, then there is no problem. The other person willaccept it and say, “Okay, I’ve been very wrong and bad.” But that’s notthe case. We know that both people are looking at each other with thesame kind of inflated mind. When the fruit of the action of prideripens, we experience the realm of the gods. In the gods’ realm, we have so much happiness. We have the joy ofmaterial wealth as well as the joy of samadhi meditation, the mentalwealth.

We have the pride ofthinking we have achieved the highest state of wealth, of joy, of hap-piness, and of samadhi.But there is a great experience of suffering in the realm of the gods.In this realm, there still is the tremendous suffering of decay and even-tual death. It is said that gods can predict their death a week before ithappens. They can see it. Everyone in the realm sees it. One weekbefore their death, no one will come near them. They become totallyisolated from the rest of the realm. Actually, one week in the gods’realm is a long, long time for humans. According to The Words of MyPerfect Teacher, by Patrul Rinpoche, one day in the gods’ realm is onehundred human years. So, one week is seven hundred years. Therefore,at the time of death, when that karma is finished and it’s time to departfrom the realm of the gods to somewhere less favorable, there is theexperience of tremendous suffering. When we think about it, seven days is a long time, isn’t it? If we areenjoying something, time feels so short. But if we are experiencing ahard time, one hour feels so long. We keep looking at the sun to see ifsomething is wrong outside! We can see for ourselves how these canbe very psychological as well as physical experiences. In the gods’ realm, there is no genuine path to liberation. No mat-ter how much material wealth we enjoy at that point, we are stillwithin the range of samsaric fear. It is pervaded by samsaric fear.It is also said that beings in this realm develop a wrong view towardscause and effect, towards the law of karma. Until the time of death,these beings thought they had reached some sense of liberation. Thenthey realize that they have to go back. At that point, they lose faith inkarma.

We need to learn to bein that state completely, honestly, and without trying to pretend to besomething better or something different. At the same time, weacknowledge our own pride, passion, aggression, and so on. We areaware of that emotion. We recognize it. We learn to be in the raw stateof the emotion itself, without altering it, without trying to be some-thing else. For example, a rose is a rose and a sunflower is a sunflower. If we justappreciate the rose as being a rose, it is beautiful. It has lots of goodqualities. It has a lot of beauty in its own state. But whenever we try tochange that rose into something else, the problem starts. Wheneverwe try to change one thing into something else, the problem starts. Inthis prayer, Dzogchen teaches us to remain in the natural state ofwhatever emotion we have. It is to be totally awake and totally awarein that natural state. Being in that natural state will accomplish every-thing because that itself is in the nature of buddhahood. We don’tneed anything else. If the nature is not in rigpa or not in the state ofbuddha, then why bother? That is the logic. Even if we try to change,it’s not going to work. inflated mind : 137Penetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 137"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"?Continuous StruggleThe next aspirationis related to the emotion of jealousy:Through the habit of developed dualism, From the agony of praising oneself and denigrating others, Quarrelsome competitiveness develops.

It leads into the veryspeedy cycle of competitiveness, the very suffering of fighting andquarreling out of jealousy. The main problem of jealousy is lack ofappreciation. It has the essence of a hungry ghost element, alwayswanting more. That’s what we call competitiveness, always wantingmore than what we have. If we let these thoughts of jealousy and competitiveness go wild,we get a negative result. We are born into the realm that is the resultof jealousy, called the asura realm, which is also known as thedemigods’ or jealous gods’ realm. The classical Buddhist iconographyof this realm has a very big wish-fulfilling fruit tree. The roots of thetree are in the demigods’ realm while the fruit on top of the tree is inthe gods’ realm.

They enter this continuous struggle of being killedand mutilated. The jealous gods’ realm has this suffering of always envying some-one else’s wealth, happiness, or joy, and then fighting for it out of jeal-ousy. If we fall into that category, through the actions of our body,speech, and mind, then we are in the jealous gods’ realm. Because ofjealousy, this sense of competitiveness, we engage in aggressiveactions. The aggressive actions of anger, hatred, and aversion eventu-ally lead us to the result of being born in a hell of a realm. This is very important for dharma practitioners. Please listen care-fully. “Through the habit of developed dualism” we go through thisagony. We go through a painful experience of praising and denigrat-ing. Praising oneself directly or indirectly, and denigrating othersdirectly or indirectly, is the continual process of struggle. From suchactivities, we get caught up in the quarrelsome competitiveness thatdevelops on the basis of such actions. For that reason, the path of buddhadharma has the practice ofrejoicing. There are also practices called bodhicitta, compassion, andlove. Sometimes we act as if we have never heard of these before. If wesee any of our dharma brothers and sisters doing better than us, interms of the path quality of practicing, we should rejoice. If someoneaccomplishes more than us in terms of finishing their ngöndro ordoing Mahamudra, Dzogchen, or deity yoga practices, we shouldrejoice. We should have the thought of rejoicing in their merit. Bud-dha said that if you rejoice in the merit arising from whatever positiveactions others may be involved in, you get the same merit. Isn’t thatgreat? I don’t know why people want to suffer and struggle in doingsuch things when you can accomplish the same merit without doingthem. Therefore, there’s great merit if we rejoice. In some sense, rejoicing itself is a complete practice.

But if we getcaught up in this quarrelsome competitiveness, then we lose every-thing. Even when we engage in activities with a positive intention,there’s not much of a path quality in it if we’re getting intenselycaught up in quarrelsome competitiveness. It may be very difficult for you because you have grown up in thisculture of capitalism. It is a culture of competitiveness, so there’s asense of instinctive competitiveness coming up all the time. The pathhere is just to work with it. When it comes up, you have to work withit. That’s the whole point. Again, when we have this emotion of jealousy ripening in our mind-stream, we should just simply watch it. We should not suppress it norlet our mind become completely overwhelmed by the jealousy. Weshould maintain our balance and watch the nature of jealousy. There-fore, we make the aspiration that,Through the aspiration of myself, the buddha, May those who quarrel through competitiveness Relax their enmity. Awareness taking its seat, May they attain the wisdom of unimpeded activity.This is a very nice prayer. When you do this prayer, think about yourown klesha of jealousy, your own kleshas of competitiveness, aggres-siveness, and so forth. Pray that oneself and other beings that are suf-fering from the same kleshas be free from such thought of enmity, thatthey relax their mind and that awareness takes its seat.140 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 140"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"?Mindless ApathyThe next aspiration relates to the poison of delusion:Through the distraction of mindless apathy, Through torpor, obscurity, forgetfulness, Unconsciousness, laziness, and bewilderment, One wanders as an unprotected animal as a result.It’s very clear that ignorance becomes the root of all problems.Ignorance has the quality of not knowing what to adopt and what torelinquish. Ignorance is not just being unmindful, it doesn’t have thesharpness to see the situation clearly. Mindless apathy is the first aspect of delusion, so to speak. Torporis that sense of being very heavy, very thick in terms of clarity. Obscu-rity is not seeing the nature directly. It is not seeing things directly orclearly. And forgetfulness, I don’t remember. Here, “unconscious-ness” refers to the literal meaning of unconsciousness, such as faint-ing and similar experiences. Laziness is usually seen as the opposite of exertion or diligence. InBuddhism, exertion or diligence is taking delight in positive action,whether it’s mental or physical. So the general sense of laziness is nottaking delight in any positive or beneficial actions. In other words, thereason we are not taking delight in certain positive actions is thatwe’re attached to some negative actions.

In the animal realm, the poison of bewilderment leadsus to the state of complete heaviness. In the animal realm, this kind ofignorance is very much present. The unprotected state of animal mindis, in some sense, completely dark and full of fear. There’s a lot more danger in the animal realm than the humanrealm. Just turn on the Discovery Channel. We can see right away thatsomeone’s eating someone else all the time, twenty-four hours a day.In the animal realm, we can see this more clearly than ever because ofall the scientists doing research on different animal species. We can seethe kind of situation they live in. There’s a complete sense of dangerand a lot of fear all the time. On a certain level, animals don’t see situations clearly. This doesn’tmean that the animals don’t perceive. It doesn’t mean the animalsdon’t know anything. It means that they don’t know the crucial thing:they don’t know what is to be adopted or what is to be relinquished. Ignorance leads us to the result of taking birth in this psychologicalstate in which there is the lack of sharpness. So, in a similar way, weapply the methods presented here. In the Dzogchen manner of prac-tice, neither rejecting nor accepting, just simply rest in this poison.We make the aspiration to free ourselves and others from such igno-rance that lacks the sharpness of discriminating wisdom:Through the aspiration of myself, the buddha,May the light of lucid mindfulness ariseIn the obscurity of torpid bewilderment.May nonconceptual wisdom be attained.142 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 142"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"This is an important aspiration, because we all have this very stronganimal quality of ignorance. It is important to aspire that our mindsare not always spaced out. It is important to pray that our minds getmore concentration, more sharpness, more on-the-point-of-dharmadiscernment. It is important to pray that our minds have the wisdomto realize the nature of rigpa within this ignorance. According to the Vajrayana path of Dzogchen, even the nature ofignorance is in the nature of awareness. So, without altering the stateof ignorance, without altering that state of unmindfulness, just sim-ply look at the nature of this unmindfulness. Looking at the simpletruth of basic ignorance, one will find the enlightened radiant clarityof mindfulness within the darkness of unmindfulness. In order totake this onto the path, we have many different practices such as thepractice of luminosity, which uses the deep state of sleep as the path.This clearly shows that the nature of ignorance is in the nature ofluminosity. Question: You explained that in Tantra transcending disturbing emo-tions means not avoiding them. Can you explain how it is possible tostay, for example, in the emotion of hate with nothing less and noth-ing more?Rinpoche:The true state of hatred, when you experience anger verystrongly, is beyond concept. It’s just an experience. It is like a vibra-tion that you feel inside. When it is really strong, there is no conceptat all. That’s why no actions are very logical when they arise fromanger. They are very stupid. If you look at them after a few hours, a fewdays, or a few weeks, you will see how stupid they were. That isbecause they were coming out of total nonsense. What we are saying here is to just remain in that vibration of anger,which is almost like a complete shock.

It comes close to the end of words at a certainpoint. Buddha said that working with your emotions is like being a war-rior on a battlefield. Emotions are like your enemy at this stage. Youare the warrior. If you see that the enemy’s troops are stronger, moreskilled, and much bigger than yours, then the first method is to run.Run away rather than be stupid and get killed in the name of bravery.That’s what the Vinaya path in the basic Hinayana journey is all about. We do not run away completely: we run back to our training center.We get more training and build up our skills and power. We do this byour meditation. We retreat into monastic cells and meditate. We buildup the power of our remedies and then come back to fight. When youare ready and know that you are going to conquer the enemy, then goahead. In the basic Hinayana and Mahayana journey, it’s like fightingon the battlefield. You are dealing with one individual soldier afteranother. There is a lot of detail work. A lot of conquering is required. In Tantra, Buddha taught that the easiest way to win this war is tosimply conquer the king. Once you do that, you don’t have to go ontoa battlefield and worry about individual details. When you conquerthe king, you have conquered the whole army. So the Vajrayanamethod is slightly different. 144 : penetrating wisdomPenetrating Wisdom_Interior 7/3/09 10:35 AM Page 144"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Q: Every time I try to conquer the king, I get halfway there and thenall the thousand soldiers come up within me. Do you think it is advis-able to try to conquer the king, and then, if I see that I can’t manage,to go back to counting breaths or some other method?R:When you think about conquering the king, you can obviously seethat there is a sophisticated protection barrier built up around him. Itis like the Secret Service. Conquering the king requires a lot of skillfulmeans and wisdom, prajna and upaya. That prajna and upaya are some-thing that we learn in Vajrayana. So, before you can conquer the king, you need to do a little research.You need to know how the guards are positioned and so forth. Thenwe can apply the method more effectively, and it will work. Therefore,going back to counting breaths sounds good. Then you can get addi-tional methods to apply in a particular situation. It’s very hard to gen-eralize here. It is like trying to make a program that will work both onMac and PC. It’s quite challenging. There are different methods toapply to each of the different disturbances we have. When we applythe methods and work with the skillful means of the Vajrayana, thenwe can conquer the king. But it’s a matter of your skillfulness, it’s amatter of the sharpness of your prajna. Q: Rinpoche, you said we should accept ignorance as it is, but we don’teven recognize it because there is no discrimination. It’s like being ina fog. Do you have any further suggestions?R: On the one hand, ignorance is difficult to see. It is subtle, so it ishard to recognize. On the other hand, it’s not that difficult, as we areoften ignorant in handling situations. Because we are not skillful,when we fail to deal with an emotion and work with the disturbances,we can clearly see ignorance.

Whenever you see strongego-clinging, that is ignorance. It’s very obvious. As for the method, we have a tradition in Mahayana practice ofreviewing the whole day. Every evening in our last session of medita-tion, we review the whole day. We try to think about the major emo-tional events that occurred during the day. We recollect whether wehad a major anger, a major passion, or a major experience of hatredduring that day. Then we really try to see it and we try to see how wehandled it. Maybe we were somewhat successful, maybe we failed. Wealso try to see how many positive thoughts we had. See how manygood thoughts that we had, such as thoughts of compassion. If we dothat in our last meditation, we can see our ignorance pretty clearly. Wecan see our ignorance in these experiences of screwing up our oppor-tunities to recognize rigpa. By reflecting, we can try to recognizeignorance. Q: Dullness seems like the opposite of feeling naked, but I was won-dering if dullness could be felt in a naked way. R: Absolutely. That’s why even the very extreme dullness of deep sleepis also taken onto the path in the Vajrayana. There’s a way in which wetry to realize luminosity in that very experience of dullness, in thatvery experience of complete ignorance, so to speak.

That is the nature. That is the ground of all. As we discussed, the three realms are the realms of desire, form, andformlessness. Another way to look at it is to see the desire realm as therealm of apparent body, which is physical existence. It is the physicalworld that we experience in connection to our body. The realm ofform is more like our speech, which is half physical and half nonsub-stantial. The realm of formlessness is the realm of our mind. So, if youlook at the three realms in connection to our own existence, they arebody, speech, and mind from the Tantric point of view. Whether we look at it from the Abhidharma or the Dzogchen pointof view, all beings of the three realms are all equal to the Samantabha-dra Buddha in the all-ground. “In the all-ground” refers to the groundof alaya, in which we’re all equal. It is the same as buddha nature the-ory. The ground of alaya is in the state of alayajnana, which has thesame nature as the wisdom of kadak.

They’re all the same in the one ground.However, that one ground becomes the ground of mindless confusionfor samsaric beings when they fail to recognize it.Now, they engage in pointless actions.The six actions are like the bewilderment of dreams.As we discussed earlier, going from the unconscious state to thatterrified blurry cognition, to the innate ignorance, to the labelingignorance, and so forth, bewildered beings engage in many pointlessactions as a result of such confusion. The six actions of the six kleshaslead to the six states of beings, and the six samsaric realms. All of theseactions result from bewilderment, which is in the nature of a dream,illusory and nonsubstantial. Because of ignorance, because of ego-clinging, we have the delu-sion of the six realms that is like a dream. Therefore, we make this aspi-ration that beings who are going through the dreamlike illusion of thesix realms realize this manifestation of rigpa. We are making the aspi-ra tion that they come back to their original primordial state ofSamantabhadra, the primordial state of rigpa, and so attain buddha-hood. Attaining buddhahood is the attainment of rigpa, which is theattainment of the intrinsic nature of our mind. I am the first buddha.I tame the six types of beings through emanations.When Samantabhadra says, “I am the first buddha,” it means theprimordial buddha. It also refers to our nature of mind.

There is a buddha of the human realm, a buddha of the ani-mal realm, and so on. There are different buddhas to tame beings ofthe different realms. Therefore, once again, Through the aspiration of Samantabhadra, May all beings without exception Be awakened in the dharmadhätu.Our whole aspiration is that all sentient beings come back to theiroriginal state of buddhahood.

If we screw upour Vajrayana path a little bit, then maybe it will take three lifetimes.If we screw up even more on this Vajrayana path, then it will take sevenlifetimes. In a way, this means that if we practice, we are guaranteed toachieve enlightenment within, at most, seven lifetimes. Of course, thekey is practicing according to the instruction of the guru. If we don’tattain enlightenment in seven lifetimes, it means there is serious dam-age to our samaya. This prayer says “within three lives” because once someone hearssuch a Tantric aspiration, that person makes a karmic connection tothe Vajrayana path. When one makes the connection to the Vajrayanapath, that person might get connected in this lifetime. In this lifetime,that person might practice the Vajrayana path and attain some kind ofawakening realization. But if not in this lifetime, then the Prayer saysthat it will occur within three lifetimes. This part shows a path forthose who are not interested in an elaborate idea of practice.

This aspiration has been taught for several reasons. First, I would likethe sangha to make a deeper connection to the Dzogchen lineage.Therefore, instead of just presenting a general talk of my own creation,I thought it would be auspicious to discuss an authentic teaching of theDzogchen tantras. Second, many students are already engaged in ngön-dro practices, or are interested in engaging in ngöndro practices, so it’sgood to have some kind of direct teaching relating to rigpa, nakedawareness, or ordinary mind. Third, for Vajrayana practitioners whohave completed ngöndro, and are doing yidam, Mahamudra, or Dzog-chen practices, this aspiration will be very nice to do. If you are a Tantric practitioner, visualize yourself as Samanta -bhadra Buddha and recite this prayer with reflection on each point.Briefly speaking, that is how we can practice this prayer. 154 :
