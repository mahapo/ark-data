For this reason the Buddha, who began as an ordinary being, determined throughout three limitless kalpas to sacrifice his own comfort, and with great effort and loving motivation to accumulate merit and wisdom and purify all obscurations. In Bodh'gaya he completely annihilated the mountain of ego and fully developed pervading compassion and primordial wisdom; thereafter he turned the wheel of Dharma three times not out of the intention to establish a religion, but rather to free all beings. He taught for forty-five years. By the strength of his boundless compassion, the Buddha's holy and precious teachings travelled generally throughout all of Asia, and particularly in Tibet, producing scholars and realized beings as numerous as stars in the sky. One way in which these teachings were perpetuated was through the system of lineages in which the instructions were transmitted from one lineage member to the next, from guru to disciple, in an unbroken succession. This method maintains the con-tinuity of blessing and experiences. The present text, compiled by Dorje Dze 6d of whom we will say more presently, recounts the lives of the great beings forming the Kagyu lineage, also known as the lineage of transmission. It is so designated because the Tibetan word"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"VIII THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Ka signifies oral teachings, or the Buddha's own teachings, while g:yu means lineage. This noble line has been likened to a golden rosary, for each of the individuals constituting it is as precious and perfect as the finest gold: Each is a repository of extraordinary realization, learning and attainment, and each confers upon the next the Deep Pointing Out instruc-tions which cause the direct perception of the nature of the mind as Mahamudra. To meet these Lamas, even if only through the medium of the written word, is an event of such power that any person making that contact will not be reborn in the lower realms for many lifetimes. These life stories are therefore more than just history; they are an example which inspires one to follow the path. They become a cause for freeing us from samsara, enabling us to dispel mental obstacles and achieve enlightenment. Thus, the publication of such a text as The Great Kagyu Masters: The Golden Uneage Treasury represents a blessing indeed! Our volume begins with a description of the all-pervasive and limitlessly beneficial qualities of Vajradhara (Tib: Darje Chang) who is also known as the primordial Buddha. Vajradhara is not to be confused with the historical Buddha Shakyamuni, for while the latter was an emanation, the former represents the ultimate aspect of enlightenment. Alternatively, it could be said that while Shakyamuni is the nirmanakaya, or form body aspect of compassion, Vajradhara is the formless or dharmakaya body whose all-permeating qualities, while beyond ordinary conception, are yet inherently at the core of every living being. Again one may consider that while the historical Buddha repre-sents the heat and light of the sun in terms of the way he is experienced by beings, Vajradhara is the sun itself, making its presence felt universally and without discrimination. In reality there is no separation between Shakyamuni and Vajradhara, for Shakyamuni's wisdom mind is dharmakaya, his speech is sambhogakaya, and his body nirmanakaya. But this truth is recognized according to the level of realization achieved by the different practitioners."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION IX Vajradhara transmitted the sacred teachings directly to the Indian masterTilopa who, because ofhis extraordinarily high realizations, was able to see the sambhogakaya, or subtle form body manifestation ofVajradhara. In the process Tilopa became the first in the line known as Kagyu. Tilopa was an emanation being, meaning that he was one who was born in an extraordinary way and continued to live outside the norm. Travelling throughout India, he received teachings from many different masters and extracted their essence, particularly the Buddha's Vajrayana with its empha-sis on commitment until the end of samsara to the welfare of others. Tilopa's heart-son was the scholar Naropa, who became a chancellor of Nalanda University, and whose repute was such that thousands of lesser panditas relied on his wisdom. But though N aropa was perfectly versed in the theoretical aspect of the Buddha's teachings, he realized that his own mind could not remain stable even for a moment. Thus, he determined to seek a great teacher who could point him toward the direct nature of the mind. Eventually, he met Tilopa and underwent twelve major and twelve lesser hard-ships in order to purify his karma and emotion-induced obscurations. When at last Naropa's ordeals had ended, his teacher Tilopa pointed toward the sky and said: \"Kyeho! This is the primordial wisdom of Self-awareness which is beyond words and mental objects. I, Tilo, have nothing to show. Just realize by looking at Self-awareness.\" At that moment, through the great magnificent blessings of the Lama and his own complete purification, Naropa realized harmony of mind and attained the state of Vajradhara. He received the complete teachings and transmitted them to numberless disciples in many different places, especially Kashmir. To this day we can see the remains of a great mon-astery established by Naropa in that area. Both Tilopa and Naropa combined peerless scholarship and personal realiza-tion, and were among the eighty-four great Mahasiddhas. It was the translator Marpa Lotsawa who, among Naropa's"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"X THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS star-like disciples, became his successor and lineage-holder in Tibet. Marpa was a manifestation of Dombi Heruka, and appeared in order to cause the Dharma teachings to flourish. Initially, he attended Drogmi Lotsawa from whom he received teachings and learned Sanskrit, but this alone did not satisfy him. After trading his personal possessions for gold to offer to the guru, he made repeated journeys to India and Nepal. Generally, he attended one hundred eight masters, particu-larly thirteen great Lamas, but among them the most crucial to his path were Naropa and Maitripa. Like Naropa, he underwent great hardships, even risking his life for the Dharma. By day he received teachings and by night he practiced, in this way mastering both the theory and realiza-tion aspects. It was because of Marpa's mastery that Naropa appointed him as his successor in Tibet and prophesied that his lineage would continue indefinitely like a flowing stream. Although Marpa had a wife and children, one cannot compare his to a conventional samsaric life, for such were his realizations and motivations that he could move through a householder's routine unstained. He is like a lotus in the mud, free from defilement. When someone suggested to Marpa's disciple Milarepa that he should marry in emulation of his teacher, Mila replied: \"Marpa is like a lion, and I like a fox. If the fox tries to jump as high as the lion, he only breaks his back.\" In Marpa's mind all phenomena were perceived as a Buddhafield, all sentient beings as enlightened deities, and all sounds as Dharma teachings. Thus, for him samsara constituted an enlightened state, and confusion was recog-nized as having the nature of pristine wisdom. He fully achieved Buddhahood, the Vajradhara state, in one lifetime. Marpa translated many teachings into Tibetan, especially Mahamudra and Vajrayana texts. These he transmitted to a great number of disciples, particularly the four known as the pillar disciples. Among these Milarepa was to be the most renowned."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION XI The version of Milarepa's life contained in this volume takes a somewhat different form from that found in some other texts, though it does not contradict them, for great teachers have different life stories according to the way they are perceived by different disciples. For example, while some of his students saw Mila as walking, others saw him meditat-ing, still others saw him giving teachings, and yet others saw him as ill-all at the same time! Milarepa held the practice lineage and became one of the key inspirations for Dharma followers, regardless of the sect to which they belonged. Because of his direct perception of samsara, his great renunciation, and his willingness to endure hardship, he achieved the realization of all the great Buddha qualities and became an instrument for perpetuating the Dharma in Tibet by effortlessly composing vafra doha songs. As he himself predicted, his fame was spread by the Dakinis. In our time his life story is available in many languages, and has become a healing force for beings disheartened by sam-sara. He is perhaps the best-known Buddhist figure after Shakyamuni himself. Milarepa transmitted the stainless, nectar-like teachings to numberless disciples. Among them, Gampopa has been likened to the sun, while Rechung Dorje Drakpa was com-pared to the moon. In the case of Dharma Lord Gampopa, he combined both the Kadampa and Mahamudra lineages. At this point we must switch our attention for a moment to Atisha, a prominent master at Nalanda University, who brought the Kadampa lineage to Tibet. Born into an upper-class family in Bengal (India), Atisha was untouched by worldly enjoyment because he saw clearly the nature of the samsaric state. Journeying to Serling (Golden Island) he received the Bodhisattva's vow and teachings from Lama Serlingpa, Dharmakirti. He also received teachings from Nagarjuna's lineage (profound view lineage) from the Asanga lineage (profound action lineage) and the Naropa lineage (profound blessing meditation practice lineage). Because"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"XII THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS of his strenuous study and practice, combined with the Bodhicitta motivation he so cherished, Atisha became an ornament of this world. When the time arrived for Dharma to enter the land of Tibet, Atisha journeyed there at the request of King Lha, Lama Yeshe 6d and J angchub Od, and for thirteen years gave teachings which produced many disciples, including the great Geshe Drom Tonpa. In addition, to satisfy the King, he wrote the text known as the Lamp far the Path to Enlightenment. Dharma Lord Gampopa, who was the next holder of the Kagyupa lineage, received Atisha's complete Kadampa teach, ings including the Lam Rim from Geshe Chagri Gongkawa, Chya,yulwa, Nyukrumpa, Maryulwa Loden Sherab, and oth, ers. Like an ocean which encompasses the waters of many rivers, this great being ceaselessly sought opportunities to study and practice in order better to benefit others. Thus it was that in hearing the name of Milarepa his mind was moved with conviction and the determination to reach the master whatever the sacrifice. Staying with Milarepa for three years, he studied the major Vajrayana teachings includ, ing the Six Yogas of Naropa, Chakrasamvara, Vajra Yogini, Hevajra, Guhyasamaja and others. He fully accomplished his studies and realizations, and in particular he perfected his mastery ofMahamudra and Tummo. Indeed, his mind became inseparable from the Vajradhara state. After completing his study, Gampopa went to Dagla Gampo as foretold by Milarepa. There he began giving teachings and meditation instruction to disciples gathering from all directions like geese flocking to a lotus lake. As prophesied by the Buddha in the Samadhi Raja Sutra, he attracted many thousands of disciples, as well as no less than five hundred Bodhisattvas. In this way he made the name of the Dagpo Kagyu renowned in the three worlds. It was with Gampopa that the four branches of the Kagyupa arose. These are: the Phagdru Kagyu founded by Phagdru Dorje Gyalpo, the Karma Kagyu founded by Dusum Khyenpa (Karmapa 1), the Tselpa Kagyu founded by Shang Tselpa, and the Bahram Kagyu founded by Darma Wangchuk."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION XIII Gampopa wrote many important texts according to both the Sutra and Tantra teachings. These include: the Four Dharmas of Gampopa, the Co, Emergent Wisdom, the Precious Rosary of the Excellent Path, and the Jewel Ornament of Liberation, this last being the first Lam Rim commentary printed in Tibet. All these constitute the essence of the Kadampa and Mahamudra lineage offered for the benefit of future generations. Gampopa himself said, \"In the future those who wish to see me can study the Jewel Ornament of Liberation and the Precious Rosary of the Excellent Path. It is the same as seeing me directly.\" That this is possible is because the complete essence of Gampopa's teachings and advice on compassion and wisdom is contained within these texts. If we study and practice them thoroughly and keep them in our heart, it is the same as meeting with the Buddha or Lord Gampopa himself. After Gampopa's passing, his heart,son Phagmodrupa con, tinued the lineage. Before meeting with Lord Gampopa, Phagmodrupa, under the guidance of many well,known mas, ters, studied such aspects of knowledge as the sciences of art, logic, medicine, language, and metaphysics (inner mean, ing). In particular, under the J etsiin Sakyapa he made a thorough study of the Lam Ore teachings, and became renowned for his vast and profound wisdom in these areas. He could also remain for days meditating in the state of bliss, clarity and non,conceptualization. Due to karmic connections, along with fortuitous causes and conditions, Phagmodrupa received the opportunity to meet with Dharma Lord Gampopa, the Great Physician. During one of their discussions Phagmodrupa recounted his achievement in the meditation state. Lord Gampopa, who at the time was stirring a bowl of tsampa, held out a piece of dough and said, \"This dough is more useful than your realiza, tion.\" At that moment all Phagmodrupa's pride was released. Lord Gampopa then instructed him directly, pointing out the nature of mind. Within a few days Phagmodrupa fully actualized the direct realization of Mahamudra. The skin of the ordinary state was suddenly peeled away, and at that"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"XIV THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS moment Phagmodrupa said: \"All my other great teachers lacked the one word necessary.\" Thereafter, Phagmodrupa received the complete Lineage teachings and meditation instruction. In accord with Gampopa's intent he emphasized the five~fold path of Mahamudra (bodhicitta, yidam deity, the four kayas of guru yoga, mahamudra and dedication) which encompasses the complete teachings of the Buddha, both sutra and tantra. Phagmodrupa established a monastery in Central Tibet, fully transforming that area into a sambhogakaya Buddha~ field. He gathered many thousands of disciples, among whom were eight great Kagyupas who established the Drikung, Taklung, Lingre (or Drukpa), Trobu, Martsang, Yerpa and Shukseb Kagyu orders. He also wrote several major texts, including the Phagdru Thadru, and commentaries and expla~ nations of sutra and tantra teachings. The four major and eight great Kagyu lineages, acting like brothers in one fam~ ily, benefitted countless sentient beings in different parts of the world. Phagmodrupa's successor was Lord J igten Sumgon, who is the embodiment of the Buddhas of the Three Times and a reincarnation of Arya Nagarjuna. He appeared at an auspi~ cious time and place for acting as an inspiration to those determined to be free of sainsara. Early in his life he met with great masters, received all aspects of the teachings, and eventually encountered Lord Phagmodrupa, from whom he received the complete lineage teachings. To integrate these within his mind he practiced day and night until he attained Buddhahood in the Echung Cave at the age of thirty~five. His wisdom enabled him directly to perceive the very subtle levels of cause and effect, and to become renowned as the master of interdependent origination. At the request of humans and non~humans he established a monastery at Drikung, thus becoming the founder of the Drikung Kagyu order. His teachings there were geared to his hearers' facul~ ties and level of understanding, and he easily cut through cultural differences and dogma, revealing the universal law"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION XV of causes and conditions. Though he had hundreds of disci-ples, he never excluded any beings from his heart, wishing only to dispel their suffering and establish them in freedom from samsara. The embodiment of wisdom and compassion, he cut the link of their negative propensities. In this way he is like a medicine healing all the diseases of suffering, like unstained nectar transforming the afflicting emotions into wisdom, like a moon cooling the heat of samsara, like a sun dispelling the darkness of confusion, like a wish-fulfilling gem fulfilling through pure teachings all beings' desire for peace and happiness, like a warrior conquering the enemies of suffering, like a bridge leading from samsara to nirvana, like a ship crossing the ocean of samsara, like a parent tending his children at sacrifice to himself, and like a loyal friend upon whom all can rely. Manifesting in different forms, he benefits beings tirelessly until the end of samsara. If one takes him as a root guru, he promises to bless one and lead one to enlightenment. Lord J igten Sumgon wrote many commentaries and expla-nations, especially the four volumes known as Inner Profound Teachings in which he gives meditation instruction and advice, five volumes of general teachings, and teachings on Tummo. One of his foremost works, the Gong Chik, contains all the essential aspects of Vinaya discipline, Bodhicitta and Tan-tra. This text has many commentaries, both detailed and concise, by such masters as Sherab Jungne, who was Lord Jigten Sumgon's own disciple, the Eighth Karmapa, the Fourth Shamarpa, and the Drikung Dharmakirti. Lord J igten Sumgon's disciple, the scholar Ngorje Repa, also wrote Thekchen Tenpe Nyingpo (Essence of Mahayana), a complete Lam Rim teaching of both sutra and tantra. From this great being until the present day there is an unbroken lineage of Drikung Kagyu teachers whose histories are detailed in another Tibetan text. Though there are many life stories of the great spiritual masters, this present volume stands apart from many in that it was written by a being who had accomplished both"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"XVI THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS scholarly achievements and a high level of personal real-ization. Dorje Dze Od, a reincarnate Bodhisattva, was a heart-son of Palden Ritro Wangchuk, himself a chief disciple of Lord J igten Sumgon, who caused the lineage teachings to flourish in the area of Mount Kailash (Western Tibet). Born in the city of Kyanglung, close to Mount Kailash, Dorje Dze 6d took monk's vows at the age of thirteen, became a bhikshu at nineteen, and thereafter studied all aspects of knowledge including the Root Vinaya Sutra, the Abhidharma, the Kriya Tantra, the Charya Tan-tra, Yoga Tantra and Anuttarayoga Tantra. When he attended Palden Ritro Wangchuk at Jangchubling (Drikung Thel) he instantly felt as if he were meeting a very close friend. As Dorje Dze 6d was perceived to be a proper vessel, Palden Ritro gave him all the teachings and instructions until, with practice, he realized Mahamudra, saw the Lama as Vajradhara, and was established in the non-returning state. He was fully qualified to write different commentaries, and so was the life-holder of the Buddha's teachings. In later years Oorje Dze 6d would go to Purang (Western Tibet) and gather a large number of disciples, becoming an object of refuge for both gods and humans. His more gifted disciples perceived him in miraculous ways. Once, when he was performing the Bodhicitta ceremony, three hundred horses with riders suddenly broke into the assembly, terrify-ing the people. Those disciples having pure vision saw that as the Lama entered into meditation, he became the Thousand-Armed Chenrezig, protecting the whole assembly and caus-ing the horsemen immediately to tum back. After Dorje Dze Od finished the teachings, one of his attendants asked, \"What was the meaning of all those horsemen?\" to which the Lama replied: \"The local deities of Tise and Naknyil were trying to create obstacles, but I routed them.\" After completing his Dharma activities, Dorje Dze 6d formed the intention of entering parinirvana, saying: \"The Dakinis have asked that I go to them.\" At that time his"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION XVII realized disciples received different visions: some saw para~ sols made of rainbows in the sky, and some heard celestial music. One disciple, Zhonnu Od, saw five~colored light streaming upward from the crown of the Lama's head. It is not surprising, therefore, that in Dorje Dze Od's compilation of the lives of the Lineage ancestors we find teachings representing both the ordinary state and the enlightened view. It is our privilege to be able to peruse them, recognizing that herewith we are being given the opportunity to tread the path of the great masters. For us to study and practice diligently, sacrificing temporary benefit for absolute freedom, until we achieve the same result as they.

THE TUSHITA HEAVEN AND DESCENT Before descending to earth, Buddha Shakyamuni was born in the Tushita Heaven as Devaputra with great clear mind and profound recollection. Seated on the lion throne, he gave teachings to all the gods. At this time he heard the celestial sound of the cymbals, and the songs of the Buddhas of the Three Times, perfectly invoked, addressing him thus: \"In samsara, burning with the fire of emotions, you, great warrior, pervade the clouds. The falling rain of your ambro-sia pacifies the afflicting emotions of those who are not gods.\" Hearing these and other words, he looked for the five sights-the continent calledjambudvipa; the six cities such as Champaka; the Shakya clan which, for seven generations, has not declined through intermarriage; a mother named"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"BUDDHA 19 Mahamaya, who was free from the thirty,two negative quali, ties; and a time of the five increasing degenerations in which people suffer greatly and become objects of compassion, for they are difficult to tame, hold wrong views, have a declining life span, are defiled by the five mental poisons, and gain wealth through impure means. Seeing these things, he said to the gods: \"By these signs the sentient beings injambudvipa show their afflicting emotions and their enjoyment of nega, tive action. 11 When he said this, the gods replied: \"All of Jambudvipa is in ruins because of the six dialecticians, the six followers, and the six meditators. Therefore, do not go there. 11 Devaputra refused to listen, saying: \"I will blow the conch shell of impermanence, beat the gong of emptiness, and roar with the sound of selflessness. 11 He then empowered Maitreya to take his place on the throne, and declared three times to the six realms of the gods that he was descending to this world. Then he manifested as the precious elephant having an immense, though glorious and gentle, body with six trunks. He was adorned with the golden nets and a beauteous red hat, and gave forth a pleasant odor because of the medicinal herbs he ate. 2. ENTERING THE MOTHER'S WOMB In the middle of the night of the fifteenth day of the second month at the time of the full moon, when Mahamaya was in retreat, the Lord Buddha entered her womb through the right side. Mahamaya then dreamed that a mountain had become her pillow, that the sun was rising within her body, and that she was giving teachings to many sentient beings. She felt light and at ease. In the months to come she had many other auspicious dreams, and experienced bliss and freedom from afflicting emotions. 3. BIRTH After ten months, the moment arrived for giving birth.

The child emerged from her right side, and Brahma and lndra descended to earth to make offerings, wrapping him in a pure silk cloth. After the gods and nagas bathed him, the child took seven steps in each of the four directions. At that time he revealed many jewel treasures and fulfilled the wishes of his father so that he became known as Siddhartha (the Fulfiller of Wishes). To pay homage to the yaksha Shakya Phel, the Bodhi~ sattva sat on a chariot throne made of four precious jewels, and proceeded to the city of Kapilavastu. Here were assem~ bled some of the Shakya clan who, being untamed, respected no one. But when the Bodhisattva passed, they immediately grew docile so that he became known as Shakyamuni (the Tamer of the Shakyas). When he neared the temple of Shakya Phel, the god came out and did prostrations. Thus, he also became known as the God of Gods. As his mother passed away seven days after his birth, thirty~two nurses were appointed to care for him. All the Brahmins and astrologers prophesied that if the child renounced the kingdom, he would become a Buddha; other~ wise, he would become a universal monarch. One day a rishi called Krishna, along with his nephew, came to the kingdom from the Himalayas. King Suddhodana asked: \"Why have you come here?\" and the rishi replied: \"Great king, I have come to see your son.\" The sage and liberator of sentient beings I have come to see.

He is a great saint. 21 \"So why are you crying?\" the King said. The rishi replied: Lord of Men, meeting with this Dharma treasure I die without fulfilling my wish. I know I Cdnnot enter into nirvana. Seeing my faults, tears come to my eyes. Later, this rishi's cousin, whose name was Mejin, became a monk of the Buddha and was called Kathayana. 4.

It is not wise to stay near woman. Later, in considering the matter, he said: The previous Bodhisattvas who have appeared Had wives and children. I will follow their path. So saying, he agreed to take a wife. \"What kind of consort do you wish?\" they asked. The Bodhisattva set down the neces~ sary qualities for his princess and gave the list to his minister, saying: \"If you find such a woman, bring her to me.\" When the minister took the note to the daughter of Shakya Lakna Bechon, she asked him: \"Why do you come to me?\" He said: The son of Suddhodana, Supremely beautiful, Adorned with the thirty~two special marks And possessing glorious attributes, Has named these qualities Which are acceptable to him in a queen. She replied: Brahmin, I possess all these qualities. This supreme being can become my husband. If he agrees, do not delay our union. King Suddhodana asked that she be brought to the palace, but her father, thinking that the Bodhisattva was not skilled in athletics, refused to give his daughter to Shakyamuni.

The Shakya Bechon then offered his daughter to the Bodhi, sattva, who in addition accepted other queens and their retinues, totalling eighty,four thousand in all. 6. RENOUNCING THE KINGDOM At this time the Bodhisattva was invoked in music and song. As the rishi predicted, the father had a dream of the son's renunciation. Becoming frightened, he heaped yet more worldly treasures on his son and appointed guards to watch over him. But one day the Bodhisattva's attendant Dunpa drove his chariot in the eastern, southern and western directions where he saw aging, sickness and death. Seeing such suffering, he was greatly moved and said: What is the use of youth Which is ultimately destroyed by age? What is the benefit of health Which will only end with illness? What is the good of wisdom in life If this life lasts not forever? Aging, sickness and death follow each other inevitably.

I intend to search for the garden of hardships Visited by previous Buddhas seeking enlightenment. I know that this will please all the sages. Dunpa replied: This is not the hour to go to the garden. No one holds malice toward you here; You have no enemies, So why do you need a horse at midnight? The Prince replied: Dunpa, you have never disobeyed me, So do not do so now as we prepare to separate. At last Dunpa brought the horse, but the horse would not allow the Prince to mount him. The Prince told him: Ngakden, this is the last time That you will carry me. So take me without delay To the garden of hardships. After achieving enlightenment I will quickly fulfill the needs Of all sentient beings Through the rain of samadhi.

There are no friends in samsara. He then cut his hair in front of the fully pure stupa, and returned to Dunpa. lndra, manifesting as a hunter, brought monk's robes which the Prince exchanged for his fine gar~ ments of silk. He then made a bowl from the leaf of the karavira tree and set out to see King Bimbisara to equalize the virtue. 1 The King, feeling great devotion, addressed the assembly: Adorned with the supreme signs And many marks of perfection, He walks a short distance ahead. Gaze upon him, 0 wise men. As the King and Siddhartha walked together the King spoke of the luxuries of samsara, and on returning to his palace staged many entertainments. But Siddhartha said to him: I am not interested in worldly pleasures. Even if this entire earth and its oceans Were filled with the seven types of gems, Men would be dissatisfied. It is like burning firewood in summer. So all desires lead to attachment and hatred.

But he promised to liberate sentient beings And now it seems he will die. And they told Mahamaya that her son, Siddhartha, would soon pass away. Hearing this, the mother descended from the heavens and made this lamentation: When my son was hom in the garden of Lumbini Fearlessly, like a lion, he took seven steps, Looked in the four directions and said: This is my final birth. You have not fulfilled this pleasing prophecy; I see the words of the rishi Krishna unrealized That you would achieve enlightenment. All I see is the impermanence of death. Who will give life to my only son? Siddhartha replied: This earth may crumble; The sun, moon and stars fall away. Yet even if I were an ordinary being I would not die. Soon I will achieve Buddhahood.

May you achieve the ultimate state And fully accomplish your excellent thought. B. APPROACHING ENUGHTENMENT When the Bodhisattva was approaching enlightenment, the gods created a road of golden sand, sprinkled it with sandalwood-scented water, and strewed flowers on the ground. In this way they made many offerings. The Bodhisattva then addressed T ashi, a seller of grass: Tashi, quickly give me some kusha grass; It will be of great use, For today I will subdue the maras with their retinues, And will reach peaceful, precious enlightenment. He made an offering of this smooth grass, which was green like the neck of a peacock, and spread it under the bodhi tree with the roots facing the tree.

The hundred,handed said: My body has a hundred hands, And even one can shoot one hundred arrows. I will therefore pierce the body of practitioners. Father, rejoice, come forth; Do not lag behind. Those who gathered to his right delighted in positive action, and were known as Great Discrimination Mind.

As no son had been born to them, the man and woman made offerings and prayed to the worldly gods, the triple gem, the spiritual friends (gurus) and Chakrasamvara. In this way a son was born. When he was shown to astrologers and others who read signs, some recog~ nized in him the marks of a god, others the marks of a human being, and still others the mark of a Buddha. None could agree on who he was: We do not know if this child Is a god, naga, or yaksha. Still, guard this excellent being with care. The boy was given the name Brahmin Salyo. When he was growing up, a fearsome, ugly woman came to care for him. She said, \"There is no place where one can avoid death.\" The boy's mother therefore asked her, \"What can I do for him?\" And the woman replied, addressing the boy: Herd buffalo And read scriptures. There you will find the prophecies of the Dakinis. With this she disappeared. One day, while the Brahmin Sal yo was herding buffalo"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS and reading the scriptures under the shapa tree, the woman appeared again, this time asking his name, the country of his birth, and the name of his parents. \"My country is Zako in the East. My father is the Brahmin Salwa; my mother is the Brahmin Saldenma; my sister is the Brahmin Saldron; and I am the Brahmin Salyo. This tree is the shapa root and I am tending buffalo to earn my living, as well as practicing the Dharma by reading scriptures.\" She replied: \"This is not how it is.\" He asked: \"Then what is the truth?\" She replied: \"Your country is Oddiyana in the North; your father is Chakrasamvara; your mother is Vajrayogini; your brother is Pantsapana, and I am your sister, Bliss,giver. If you want to find the true buffalo1 go to the forest of the bodhi tree. There the stainless Dakinis hold the ear,whispered teachings.\" He replied: \"If I go there, the Dakinis will pose obstacles and prevent me from succeeding.\" She said: Yogi, you can get the teachings. You have received the predictions And kept the samaya vows. Realizing that she was a Dakini he said: \"The path is dange, rous and I do not know how to traverse it.\" In reply she gave him a crystal ladder, a jeweled bridge, and a coral,handled key, saying: \"I give you my blessings; depart without hesitation.\" The ladder and the bridge spanned the gulf And the key opened the locks. Fearlessly he journeyed to Oddiyana in the North and approached the iron wall of Gandhola. Using the Dakini's bridge, he crossed a poisonous lake, and with the ladder climbed the iron wall. The temple of Gandhola had three gates. Opening the first, he found the stainless Dakinis of outer nirmanakaya emanations. These manifested myriad fearsome forms, with unpleasant sounds and threatening gestures to cause him fright. 1 meaning: his real mission."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"TILOPA We are the stainless Dakinis Who desire flesh and blood. But the yogi said: Even your frightening gestures and threatening sounds, 0 fearsome Dakinis, cannot make the hairs of my body Stand on end. 37 Hearing this, all the Dakinis fell into a faint, and when they regained consciousness they begged his pardon. As Tilopa entered the courtyard, the Dakinis said: We are to you as the butterfly to the lamp; The butterfly hopes to extinguish the lamp, But instead dies in the light. Just so, we hoped to harm you, But you overpowered us. One among them continued: I am just an ordinary being, without authority. If I do not ask our leader's permission to let you in, She will eat my flesh and drink my blood. Therefore, precious one, please do not think unkindly of me. With this she disappeared inside the temple. Then the Loka Karma Dakinis, the middle or sambhogakaya emanations, appeared and said: We are the Loka Dakinis Who eat flesh and drink blood. Making the three threatening mudras, Tilopa overpowered the body, speech and mind of these Dakinis, saying: 0 great fearful Dakinis, Even you cannot make The hairs of my body stand on end."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Hearing this, all the Dakinis fell into a faint, and when they regained consciousness they said: We are to you as flies to a lamp. You have overpowered us. The chief among them continued: I am a Minister, yet have no authority. If I don't ask her permission to let you in, Our Queen will eat my flesh and drink my blood. Please do not think unkindly of me. With this, she disappeared inside the temple and spoke to the Queen, who permitted Tilopa to enter. Immediately he went into the meditation state without paying homage to the Queen. At this, all the Dakinis became angry and said: She is the blessed one, The mother of the Buddhas of the Three Times. Let us beat him Who shows no respect. But the blessed mother said: He is Chakrasamvara, The father of the Buddhas of the Three Times. Even a rain of vajras falling on him Could not destroy him. Therefore I will give him the teachings. Thus, he received the teachings of the prana and many others which are unrecorded. Still, he was not satisfied. Then the blessed mother said: \"Who are you, who sent you here, and what do you want?\" Tilopa replied: I am Pantsapana, My sister, Determa, sent me; I want the perfect teaching, The stainless bliss, the great secret Of the ordinary and extraordinary."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"TILOPA The blessed mother said: In my three treasures There are three wish,fulfilling gems, Co,emergent wisdoms Which dispel the darkness of ignorance. I will give these to you if you understand the signs. 39 In the three treasures are three signs of body, speech and mind: the self,arising body of co,emergent yab,yum; the seven,syllable self,arising emerald gem in the three,pointed Dharmakara of vajra speech; and the five,pointed vajra jewel of the self,arising mind. Tilopa recognized these, besides seeing the three secret tantra treasures which he requested in general: In the secret treasure of body, speech and mind, the three wish,fulfilling gems, I request the view, meditation and action And samaya teachings of self,liberation. The Dakinis replied: The secret treasure of body, speech and mind, The three wish,fulfilling gems, Are sealed to the great yogi Who was prophesied, and who kept the samaya. Though you are fortunate, You may not be able to open the door. Thus, they answered in general. Tilopa then addressed the blessed mother in particular: From the body treasure ofT sakali I request the common wish,fulfilling gem; From the speech treasure of jeweled scripture I request the samaya wish,fulfilling gem; From the wisdom mind treasure of mudra I request the wish,fulfilling gem of the mode of abiding."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"40 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS The blessed mother said: From the body treasure ofT sakali The common wish~fulfilling gem Is sealed with the lock of the prophesied one. It cannot be opened to you who are not prophesied. From the speech treasure of jeweled scripture The samaya wish~fulfilling gem Is locked by the samaya keeper. It cannot be opened to you who do not keep the samaya. From the wisdom mind treasure of mudra The mode of abiding of the wish~fulfilling gem Is sealed by the realized yogi. It cannot be opened to him who is unrealized. Tilopa replied that he had the three keys necessary. In the forest of the shawa garden The Dakini gave me the keys and prophesied: You who were prophesied kept the teachings; You who are realized, bring the teachings. All the Dakinis mocked him and said: \"The one who made this prophecy is an emanation of a mara. A blind man cannot see Even if he is shown form; A deaf man cannot hear Even if he listens to noise; A mute cannot speak Even if he is told to utter sound; A crippled man cannot move Even if he is commanded to walk. So there is no truth in you Who are deceived by maras. Tilopa replied: A lie is a false word. When falsehood ends There is no lie."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"TILOPA It was not a mara speaking to me, But a Dakini. And he repeated that he had the keys to open the three secret treasures which are sealed: If I divide these three keys, I have the self, liberation key of samaya Which opens the door to the tantra of 'lalavara, And to the mental vow of the secret ~ Â·Â·rd of the Dakin is, And to the light of wisdom which dispels the darkness of ignorance, And to self,awareness, self,arising, and self,clarity. I have the key of spontaneous experience Which opens the door to the mind,as,such, Self,appearing clarity which is ever unborn, The great prediction of the Dakinis. I have the key of experience of the realized yogi Which opens the door to the non,appearance of non,objective mind, Without even a particle of unmindfulness, And to Mind,as,such, Dharma,as,such, and Dharmakaya. When he said this, all the Dakinis were pleased and held a ganachakra feast. Along with the sindhura vajra wisdom mandala, they gave him the four empowerments by which he achieved the two attainments. They also gave him the ear, to,ear and mind,to,mind lineage teachings with the bless, ings of the wisdom Dakinis who said: Father, the blessed one, Chakrasamvara, the supreme bliss, Tilo, the Buddha, Lord of Sentient Beings, We offer you the three wish,fulfilling gems. They gave him all the teachings of the Hearing Lineage: in general, the teachings of the Chakrasamvara Tantra; and in particular, the secret meaning of the quintessence. They"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"42 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS also transmitted to him the Ocean of Samvara, the Ocean of Vajra, the Ocean of Heruka, the Ocean of the Dakinis, the Ocean of Action and the Ocean of Activities, as well as the TanlTa of }yorwa Shi Khagyor, the TanlTa of Heruka Bhadra, the TanlTa of N-yingpo, the TanlTa of the Vajra Dakinis, the TanlTa of Dechok Dorje Trengwa, the TanlTa of Dakini Sangwai ZO, and the TanlTa ofVajradhara Self,Appearance. These were the thirteen tantra teachings given to him. Thus, he achieved the first stage, and attaining the heavenly realms he soared to the sky, saying: In space like a bird Fly without obstacles, Prajnabadra. In the pervading emptiness Of the element of appearance Fly, awareness, wisdom. All the Dakinis requested that he remain with them. Where will you go, precious one? Please remain here for our benefit. Refusing them, he said: \"I will have different families of disciples. I must therefore leave you for this purpose. I, the yogi, will go to T sukgi Norbu Monastery For the spiritual sons Naropa, Ririkasori, and others. Just as he was disappearing, a formless Dakini gave him the nine Dharma subjects with their sounds and signs: \"Loosen the knot of the mind by ripening liberation; act like a sword striking the water; chase the sun of realization which is the material of samaya; see samaya in the mirror of your mind; see that the light of awareness is wisdom; turn the wheel of the channel and wind net; see the outer mirror equalizing taste; see the mahamudra of self,liberation; hold the jewel of the great bliss speech.\" Thus he was given the nine teach, ings. Realizing them, he said: In the temple of the illusory body Place the sacred teachings of the formless Dakini."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"TILOPA 43 Keep the steel of unexpressed speech. Fly, 0 bird of the clear light mind. And he proceeded to the Crest Ornament Monastery. This shows how Tilopa as a human being overpowered the Dakinis, and how he received the teachings. B. Acting as a Non-human Teacher The Saint Tilopa became famous by receiving the teach-ings directly from the Wisdom Dakinis in Oddiyana. When he was asked who his Lama was, Tilopa replied: I have no human teacher; My Lama is the Omniscient One. Looking down from the sky, the Dakin is said: Tilopa, who realized the two truths And is expert in the five aspects of knowledge, You have no human teacher; All your Lamas are omniscient ones. When the people heard that Tilopa did not have a human lama, they lost their faith in him. C. To Put an End to Non--devotion, Tilopa Shows That He Has a Human Teacher. The great yogi Tilopa received two Buddha lineages, and four lineages of the realized yogins. Thus, he held six lineages. Among the Buddha lineages he received from Vajrayogini, mother of the Buddhas of the Three Times, was the hearing lineage teaching which was not recorded. This he received in Oddiyana in the North. He also received and realized the tantra of the secret mantra from Vajrapani at the Cemetery of the Burning Flame in the East. From the four yogins, he received the following teachings: The Teachings of Arya Nagarjuna In Bhalenta in the South at the time that Tilopa was a shepherd there, Nagarjuna was practicing with the aim of"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"44 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS achieving the precious vase attainment. After he had done so, Tilopa came upon him and from him received the instruc-tions of the clear light and illusory body from the father tantra of Guhyasamaja. Nagarjuna appointed Tilopa King of that area; so he was called Nada Tilo. Outside the kingdom were many non-believers, but within the kingdom everyone felt strong devotion for Tilopa. Riding an elephant and carrying a sword and shield, he struck all the trees, saying: \"Enter the battle.\" At once, all the trees became soldiers, as did the grass and the bushes. Thus, those who formerly lacked devotion toward Tilopa developed deep trust. When there was an invasion of this country by Persians, Nada Tilo imbued his subjects with fearlessness. Climbing on a giant trunk, he radiated a bright light from his shield which blinded the entire army, along with their horses and ele-phants. When he raised his sword, men fled in every direction: Tum back the battle of Duruka, The shield and sword achieved their goal. The Teachings of Lawapa From Rolpai Dorje, a disciple of Lawapa, Tilopa received the instructions of Clear Light and Bardo from the teaching ofHevajra. The Teachings of Luipa Tilo received the entire Chakrasamvara teachings from the Nampar Gyalwa of the Luipa Lineage. The Teachings of the Great Brahmin Saraha Tilo received the entire Mahamudra teachings from Shawari. These are the lineage teachings received from the four yogins. Some say that from the Dakini Kalwazangmo he received the instructions ofKarmamudra, Phowa, and Bardo from the Dompa Gyatso Tantra, and that from Acharya Charyawa he received the Tummo instructions, the practice of the ground, path and fruition from the Chokrasamvara Tantra."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"TILOPA Charyawa, Ludrub, Lawapa, and Kalwazangmo Are the four Lamas of my lineage. D. Achieving the Attainment of Residing in HeatJen 45 In the East Tilopa became realized through pounding sesame seeds. He sang this song: The ignorant do not know That oil is the essence of the sesame seed; Likewise, not knowing the branches of interdependence, They cannot extract their essence. Just so, the co~emergent wisdom Resides in the heart of all sentient beings; Yet it cannot be realized Unless it is pointed out by a Lama. Pounding the shell of sesame Releases its essence; Likewise, the meaning of suchness Is revealed by the Lama's instructions. Transformed into one nature Is the inseparability of all objects. Kyeho! Marvelous it is to see clearly in this moment The depth of meaning For which others journey far. There is no need for the antidote wisdom; There is no path or stage to traverse; There is no goal to achieve. On hearing these teachings, a great assembly under the five Pantsapana leaders were liberated in a moment of the afflicting emotions, and all achieved the attainment of resid~ ing in Heaven. Thus, the entire place was emptied of inhabitants. E. The Great Quality by Which Tilopa Overcame a Powerful Yogin A King named Metok Lingpa requested on behalf of his"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS mother that all the Panditas and Yogins perform a ganachakra feast. They agreed that this was the highest path to accumuÂ· late virtue, and all attended and built the mandala. When a powerful yogi who was leading the assembly sat on the throne, a lady of ugly appearance arose from the midst of the yogins and pointing to him, said: \"You cannot lead the meditation.\" The assembly asked: \"Then who should lead?\" She replied: \"My brother.\" \"Where is he now?\" they asked. \"He is in the Blazing Cemetery.\" The assembly set out to seek him, and found him swinging from the hair of a horse's tail which was suspended from the little toes of corpses piled on the branch of a tree. He was blue of appearance, with bloodÂ·shot eyes, wearing cotton undergarments. They requested that he come to the feast, and when he arrived he and the yogi sat together on the throne and began engaging in a contest. Each built a shrine for worship and then tried to destroy that of the other by his miracle powers. Tilopa succeeded in destroying the yogi's shrine, but the yogi could not destroy Tilopa's. Then both men manifested in many different forms, each carrying a corpse on its back. The corpses were then transformed into the materials of the ganachakra feast. Through his meditation, Tilopa transÂ· ferred all his corpses to the cemetery, but the yogi could not do the same. Then Tilopa turned his body inside~out and from each pore manifested a palace of mandala deities, complete with cemeteries. He also manifested Jambudvipa in which there resided many Buddhas benefitting all sentient beings. Then, riding on snow lions, he brought the sun and moon down to earth and galloped over them. The Yogi could not match this feat, and so was roused to great devotion for Tilopa. Everyone asked: \"Who is this amazing yogi?\" Tilopa replied: I am Tilopa, the realized yogi, Free from effort in whatever I do. Then he led the meditation, and the other yogi begged his"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"TILOPA 47 pardon, requesting the teachings. The powerful yogin Lodro is now in the Oddiyana country. F. Subduing the Heretics Seeing a heretic doing harm to the Buddha's teaching, Tilopa said to himself: \"It is time to subjugate this being. 11 He therefore agreed to enter a debate whose outcome would determine which man's path would prevail. The king acted as mediator in this debate on language, logic and other subjects. As in the building and destroying of the mandala shrine, the heretic stopped the sun in its course and Ru (Tilopa) caused it to set. Then he halted the sun, but the heretic could not cause it to set. Ru said, \"Cut your locks and enter my path. 11 But the yogin became angry and radiated flames in his direction, saying: I can shake the three realms; There is no yogin I cannot terrify. Tilo then manifested a larger flame, and sent both it and the heretic's fire back to him. Thus, the heretic's belongings were completely burned, even to his thick mane of hair. I am Tilopa, Who has achieved omniscience. The heretic developed great devotion, and with all his disci, pies did prostrations, offering a mandala and requesting teachings. Thus the assembly were liberated. The heretic became known as Yogin Nakpo Kewa and thereafter resided in the Central Wood Forest Cemetery. G. Meeting the Bannaid Entering a tavern, Tilopa said, \"Bring me some beer. 11 The barmaid replied, \"Give me some money first. 11 Tilo drew a line where the rays of the setting sun fell on the ground, saying, \"When the sun passes this line I will give you the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS money.\" As he drank the beer he transformed himself, sometimes into a cat, sometimes into different yogis, and sometimes back into his original form. In this way he drank the contents of seven cellars. When he was asked for the money again, he entered into samadhi and manifested enough casks of beer to replace all those which he had drunk. He then stayed the sun in its course, and all the beer was sold. In this way, the barmaid and her companions developed great devotion. Addressing Tilopa, she said: You are a precious being, So please allow us to be your disciples. He then transmitted the Vajrayogini practice teachings, liberating the barmaid and other beings in that very life. From that day, the barmaid, who became known as Yogini Nyimai 6d, resided in Sosaling Cemetery. H. Subduing the Magician The King of Sosaling and the magician Rakya Dewa were enemies. The magician therefore sent a magic army to defeat the people surrounding the palace. The King, realizing he was the victim of sorcery, became alarmed and assembled his ministers to determine what to do. Just then, an ugly woman appeared among them, asking, \"Why are you gathered here?\" They replied, \"We are trying to think of ways to end this war.\" She said, \"I know what to do; let us go to the King.\" When she was in the King's presence, she suggested that he seek help from Tilopa. Through samadhi meditation, Tilopa emanated myriad armies who vanquished the enemy and arrested the magician. The magician said: Precious one, you rely on the teachings. Therefore, how can you wreak such destruction? Tilopa replied: Killing magic beings is no sin Because they have no mind. Thus, the magician developed devotion and requested the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"TILOPA 49 teachings. From that day he became known as Yogin Luchye Denma and resided at Haha Cemetery. I. Manifesting Numerous Forms Tilopa manifested as a hunter and a butcher who, by his activities, caused the other hunters and butchers of the region to lose their means of livelihood. But having com-pletely realized the ultimate, he knew there was nothing to kill. ]. Showing the E.ndmt Cause and Effect A heretic, holding the view of the Lokayatas (atheists of ancient India), was preaching this doctrine to all the people of the Rada country. A Buddhist scholar refuted his argu-ments, saying that cause and effect exist. But it could not be determined which of the two men was right because there was no judge present. When Tilopa arrived in the midst of the debate, the men asked him to act as judge. At the end, Tilopa said, \"He who acknowledges cause and effect is the victor.\" The heretic then said, \"I wish to debate with you.\" Tilopa defeated him by his extraordinary insights, and gave him the teachings. Then the heretic said, \"Since I don't see cause and effect directly, I don't accept your doctrine. If it is true, please show me directly. Only then will I accept the Buddha's teachings.\" With a snap of the fingers, Tilopa showed the heretic the burning tortures of the hell realms. The heretic saw a copper pot filled with molten metal, but empty of human beings. He asked the guardian of hell, \"Why are there no beings in this pot?\" The man replied, \"In the Rada country in Jambudvipa there is a heretic who doesn't believe in cause and effect, and who is creating negative karma by spreading wrong views. After his death we will cook him in this pot!\" The heretic then said to Tilopa, \"It may be true that one is born in hell through negative karma, but perhaps it is not necessary to engage in virtuous actions.\" Tilopa said, \"Come, I will show you.\" In a moment Tilopa took him to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three Gods."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"50 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS There, in each god's palace was a divine couple-a god and goddess. In one palace, however, was a goddess standing alone. The heretic asked, \"Why has she no consort?\" The goddess replied directly, \"lnjambudvipa there is a being who is just now changing his view, understanding cause and effect, giving up non,virtuous action and practicing virtuous action. After his death, he will be reborn here.\" Thus, the heretic developed deep devotion. Tilopa said, \"Sinful beings, motivated by negative karma, suffer the mental phenomena of hell, but virtuous beings, motivated by positive karma, enjoy the mental phenomena of the higher realms.\" He then gave the heretic the teachings and liberated him. From that day he became known as Yogin Dina, and resided in Palkyiri. K. Subjugating the Butcher A butcher was taking the lives of many animals and giving their meat to his son. Tilopa, seeing that it was time to tame him, transformed the meat into the cooked flesh of the butcher's son, meanwhile hiding the son himself. When the butcher took the lid off the cooking pot and saw his son's flesh, he began to weep. Tilopa said, \"If you cease taking life, I will restore your son to you.\" The butcher agreed and Tilopa returned his son to him. The man purified his nega, tive karma, promised not to engage in any further wrong action, and developed devotion. Tilopa gave him the teach, ings and liberated him, saying: The result of one's negative actions Will return to oneself. In this way Tilopa chose him as a disciple. From that day the man became known as Yogin Dechye Gawa and resided in the land of the Rakshas. L Subjugating the Singer Once there was a skillful singer who was in the habit of entertaining the assembled crowd. When Tilopa arrived he said to the man, \"Why are you howling so?\" The singer"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"TILOPA 51 became angry and said, \"Let us engage in a singing contest.\" The singer knew only worldly songs. With enlightened voice Tilopa sang many celestial songs. The singer developed deep devotion and asked to be his disciple: Where, precious one, do you come from? You have subjugated me. Tilopa replied: I am the singer Tilopa Inhabiting the entire world of Brahma. I come here as a beauteous singer: Now I wander off, directionless. Tilopa then gave him the teachings and liberated him. From that day the man became known as Yogin Yangdan, and resided in N agara. M. Subjugating the Powerful One A man named Nyima was so powerful that he could bind all phenomena. Many people gathered about him, though they feared his power. Tilopa manifested pretended anger toward him, and in return the man cast a spell on him. Tilopa then killed the man's Dharma protectors and all his retinues. The man suffered so greatly that Tilopa looked on him with deep compassion, saying: \"I am happy because I am the victor, but you are suffering because your retinues are dead. Yet others are suffering in the same way because of your negative actions. If you promise to stop engaging in negative karma, I have a way to restore the dead.\" The man agreed, and Tilopa brought back the consciousness of those who had been killed, restoring them to the man. Thus, he developed strong devotion. Tilopa said: I, the realized yogin Tilopa Have killed no one. He then gave the man teachings and liberated him. From that day he became known as Yogin Nyida and resided in a city known as I Mi T sundha."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS II. APPEARING AS A MANIFESTATION OF CHAI<RASAMVARA Tilopa took the vows of a monk at the temple on the grounds of the Blazing Cemetery ofLakshetra, in the Ashoka garden, near the river Salanadi, because the Abbot there was his uncle and the Acharya his mother. He became known as the Bhikshu Kalapa. In the morning he meditated in a small hut; in the evening the monks gathered and said ritual prayers. Occasionally they had to do the monk's purification renewal practice, and were punished if they violated the discipline. Tilopa did the opposite: Early in the morning he killed a mass of locusts on the road, separated their heads from their bodies, and heaped them up in two piles; in the evening he went to a tavern and ate the barley residue left over from making beer. His uncle, Dawo Zhonnu, who was in charge of the monastery, could no longer tolerate such behavior. He and other monastery officials spoke privately to Tilopa and told him to cease his unconventional behavior. They also warned that if he missed the purification renewal practice he would be severely punished. But Tilopa went out and killed more locusts. At one point he was seen by the King who was journeying toward the monastery for ceremo-nial prayers. The King was so shocked that he asked, \" Who is your Abbot and who your Acharya?\" Tilopa replied: The place is the Ashoka garden. My uncle is Abbot and my mother Acharya. I am Bhikshu Kalapa. Many millions of kalpas ago I spoke with the victorious Shakyamuni, Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, and Vajradhara. I have travelled to a hundred Buddhafields And I have seen the one hundred faces of the Buddha. I have attained the blissful level And have understood the interdependence of cause and effect. I have realized the Dharmakaya of Dharmata."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"TILOPA Even the great Saraha Cannot match my realization. I have not killed any sentient beings. 53 Thus he sang, and with a snap of the finger caused all the locusts to spring to life and fly away in radiant light. Then everyone understood that Tilopa was an emanation of Chakrasamvara. He became widely known and everyone felt deep devotion for him. III. APPEARING AS CHAKRASAMVARA HIMSELF With gentle discipline Tilopa went out begging and saying prayers. Seeing him, King Dawa respectfully made offerings and asked him about his parents and other details. Tilopa said: I am Tilopa, Born in a family of Brahmins, Without father or mother. I have no Abbot or Acharya; I am the self-hom Buddha. I have no spiritual master. My knowledge of the arts of sound and logic Is self-arisen. I am inseparable from the body, speech, and wisdom mind Of Chakrasamvara. In this way it became widely known that he was Chakra-samvara himself. IV. SHOWING HIMSELF AS THE EMBODIMENT OF ALLTHEBUDDHAS The King Metok Lingpa, who felt deep devotion, was accepted by Tilopa as a disciple and liberated. The King performed a great ganachakra offering, invited many panditas and practitioners, and built a mandala. When Tilopa asked to lead the assembly, the guests all entered into samadhi,"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"54 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS each having a different view of Tilopa. When they asked who he really was, he answered, \"I am exactly as each of you sees me.\" My body is Hevajra; My speech is Mahamaya; My mind is Chakrasamvara; My limbs are Dragyunakpo; My fingers and toes are Vajrabhairava; My channels are the four~seat vajra; My winds are the vajra mala; My drops are the secret treasure; My ushnisha is Sangye Thopa; All these together are Kalachakra, The great bliss Sangye Nyamjor. My mind is co~emergent wisdom, Self~arising in the first moment, I am the unborn Buddha of the past. Unceasing in the second moment, I am the Buddha yet unborn and not~appearing. Spontaneously established in the third moment, I am the unborn Buddha of the present. My pores are a limitless Buddhafield. In these abide the body, speech and wisdom mind Of the Buddhas of the Three Times. He then proceeded to the Crest Ornament Monastery. All the great yogins learned of his renown and realized him as the embodiment of the Buddhas of the Three Times. He became known as Prajnabadra. His secret name was Dechen Dorje (Vajra of Bliss). He was also known as Thog Med Dorje (Unobstructed Vajra), Dewai Khorlo (Wheel of Bliss), Kalapa, and Tilopa."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Naropa ( 1 016, 11 00) There are four aspects to the life of the great saint Naropa, the heart-son of Tilopa: I. the outer aspect: enduring the hardship of search-ing for the outer prophecy, he is recognized as a proper vessel; II. the inner aspect: enduring the hardship of the inner practice, he reveals the meaning of the signs; III. the secret aspect: enduring the hardship of offer-ing the cherished body, he kindles the light of bliss; and IV. the ultimate aspect: enduring the hardship of obeying orders, he achieves the result. I. THE OUTER ASPECT The first, or outer aspect, consists of two parts: (A) the quality of the proper vessel, and (B) the explanations to realize the superior qualities. A. The Quality of the Proper Vessel In the town of Zambu at Shrinagara lived the King Shiwai Gocha and the Queen Palgyi Lodro, who had a daughter, Palgyi Yeshe. Since they had no son, they prayed and made"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"NAROPA 57 offerings to the Triple Gem and others. Finally, a son was born to them whom they showed to the sign readers. The sign readers said: This one is like the son of Suddhodana; If he stays in the world, He will become the lord of humans; If he renounces the world, He will achieve enlightenment and the two accumulations In this lifetime. And so he was named Prince Kuntu Sangpo. As he grew older, he asked his parents' permission to become a monk, but they refused his wish. In reply, the Prince said: Whatever we do, if it is done without Dharma It becomes a source of suffering. Therefore I go to obtain the precious Teachings. He then journeyed to Kashmir, to study with the master Arya Akasha, and received the lay ( upasaka) ordination. Thus he was called Upasaka Akashagarbha. In Kashmir he studied the Dharma and was well trained in the five aspects of knowledge [creative arts, medicine, language and sound, logic, and metaphysics or inner meaning]. But this dis~ pleased his father who wished him to marry. He said, \"What is the use of Dharma if one disobeys one's parents?\" The Prince replied, \"All the six realms of sentient beings are our natural parents, not just one or two beings. But if you find a lady of deep intuition and pure discipline, devoid of the faults of heretics and learned in the teachings of the Mahayana family, let me know.\" The King sent his ministers searching in all directions for such a person and at last, in Eastern Bengal, they found a maiden, the daughter of the Brahmin Kargyal, Brahmin Drimedma, who possessed the necessary qualities. They therefore requested her hand. But the Brahmin Kargyal said, \"We Brahmins, though considered heretics, nonetheless are possessed of great compassion, whereas your"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"sB THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS king, though a Buddhist, sometimes engages in evil deeds and shows less compassion than we. Therefore I will not grant you my daughter's hand.\" But the King's Minister insisted, and finally the Brahmin agreed. The maiden was brought to the kingdom and the two were married, but after a time the Prince became so sad that he said: Worldly life is filled with limitless faults; Therefore, I must renounce it. He made his feelings known to the Princess, and she agreed not to be an obstacle in his path. At the Happy Garden Monastery the Prince took the vows of a novice monk from Khenpo Sangye Kyab and Master Yeshe Od. And so he was called Sangye Yeshe. Later, he was fully ordained in Kashmir by the Abbot of Surgang, Chokyi Lama, and the teacher Chokyi Yeshe, and by the Secret Master Chokyi Changchub. And so he became known as Chokyi Gyaltsen. From there, he went to Pullahari Monastery where he stabilized his study and practice. There he was called Netan Tanpa Zinpa (Holder of the Teachings). At Nalanda he was appointed Northern Gatekeeper upon the passing ofKhenpo Nyimai Dorje. Whenever he debated with heretics, he emerged victorious: The evil debater Who searches for the relative meaning Will be grasped with an iron hook. The sword of the knowledge of sound and logic Cuts the root of the evil debater, And the trusty lamp of the Buddha's Teachings Dispels the darkness of the evil debater's ignorance. The wheel device of the pith instructions Destroys the city of illusion; The supreme jewel of the three noble vows Purifies the stain of wrong action. Sharpen the sword of wisdom Before the great scholar~king in Nalanda;"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"NAROPA 59 Cut the root of the tree of heretics; Plant the victory banner of the Buddha's Teachings. And so he was called J igme Trakpa (Renowned Fearless One). At Nalanda University he became Chancellor and gave teachings and monastic vows, as well as meditation instruc~ tion. One day there appeared a woman with thirty~two ugly signs-brown hair standing on end, a bulbous forehead, wrinkled and pitted face, coarse eyelashes, bloodshot, watery eyes, flat nose, twisted, gaping mouth, pendulous lips and buckteeth, lolling tongue, goiter, pendulous ears, coarse, green skin, trembling, gnarled hands, and a hump on her back. Sneezing and yawning, crying and laughing, limping and leaning on a walking stick, she asked, \"Do you know the words of the Dharma, or the meaning of the Dharma?\" Naropa replied, \"I know the meaning,\" and the woman wept. Then he said, \"I know the words of the Dharma,\" and she laughed with joy. Then he asked, \"Who understands the meaning of the Dharma?\" She replied, \"My brother.\" He said, \"Please take me to him.\" She said, \"Pray, meditate and search.\" With this she disappeared. By seeing this woman of the thirty~two ugly signs, he understood the thirty~two negative qualities of samsara in their outer, inner and secret aspects. By outer aspect it is meant that the thirty~two subtle and gross causes and effects of samsara give samsara the nature of suffering; by inner aspect it is meant that there are thirty~two impure compo~ nents to the body; by secret aspect it is meant that in the thirty~two channels of the body there are thirty~two vital energies. Through meditation on these, one can achieve the co~emergent wisdom. Realizing the truth and its opposite, he said: The mind, deluded by the appearance of samsara, Sees the faults of others with the senses. It is darkened by the prison of samsara; It is made intolerable by the fire of samsara;"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"6o THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS It is caught in the spider web of samsara; It is stuck in samsara as the bee is in nectar; It is encased in samsara like a silkworm in a cocoon. There is no substance to the hollow tree of samsara. Samsara is like the moon's reflection in water, Without essence; Samsara is like an animal chasing a mirage; He who desires samsara falls into a pit. Samsara is like being trapped in the jaws of a crocodile; Samsara is like wandering in the land of the rakshas; Samsara is like a poisonous snake which destroys anyone who sees or touches it; Samsara is bordered by the precipice of karma; Samsara is like a wave in water, or fog; Samsara is tied by the lasso of karma; Samsara is bound by the seal of karma; Samsara is the density of darkness; Samsara is the deep mud of the three poisons; Samsara is the dance of impermanence; Samsara is the enchantment of this life; Samsara is the shadow of birth and death; Samsara is a merciless hunter; Samsara is snared by the hound of death; Samsara is a vast, sorrowful field of grasping and fixation; Samsara is the galloping horse of the eight worldly dharmas; Samsara is caught by the iron hook of desire; Why should I not search for the Lama While I have this precious, impermanent body? Thus he gave away all his treasures, his Dharma texts and other belongings, saying: \"Now I will search for the perfect Lama.\" But his three pandita friends, who were also gate, keepers of Nalanda University, requested that he remain. The Western Gatekeeper, Jetari Trale Namgyal, said:"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"NAROPA The root of the teachings Is the community of the sangha; In giving up the community, The teachings disappear. Please remain with us. The Eastern Gatekeeper, Pangyakara Gupta, said: The root of Dharma Is the morality of the community; In giving up morality, The teachings disappear. Please remain with us. The Southern Gatekeeper, Nakpo Tulshuk, said: The root of the teachings Is the friend vowed to discipline; In giving up friendship, The Dharma disappears. Please remain with us. Then the five hundred panditas ofNalanda with one voice requested: We are ignorant, uncomprehending, Without the great scholar-physician of Dharma. Therefore, blessed Jigme Trakpa [Naropa] Remain here for our sakes. Thus they requested. Naropa replied: The end of birth is death; The end of meeting is parting. All accumulation is consumed. Therefore, how can I find a path without death? One may be trained in sound, logic and various commentaries, Schooled in the five aspects of knowledge, Learned in the ocean of teachings. But without a qualified Lama"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS One cannot quench the suffering of one's thirst. The essence blessing of ambrosia Of the ocean of tantras Does not satisfy one's mind Without the attainment of the Lama's blessing. Even with the quality of miracles, psychic powers and such One cannot see the ultimate meaning. Therefore, whatever happens, I will search for the holy Lama With the help of Hevajra. Thus, he refused their request. I search for the Lama By renouncing the meaningless activities of this life. Wearing his robes and carrying a staff and begging bowl, he set out towards the East. Suddenly, a celestial voice was heard: There will be a prophecy Of the Lama Buddha With the help of Chakrasamvara. Go, there you will find the Lama Buddha. On hearing this he said: Henceforth, why should I not do Chakrasamvara practice? So he built a grass hut at the Flower Cloth Cemetery. After he had recited the seven,syllable mantra ofChakrasamvara1 seven hundred thousand times, the earth shook, lights radi, ated, pleasant odors filled the air, and other miracles occurred. Two Dakinis appeared (some say in a dream, some say directly) and prophesied: Search in the East for the Lama Buddha Tilopa; This Lord of non,duality, bliss, wisdom, 1 OM HRI HA HA HUM HUM PHAT"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"NAROPA This Lord of sentient beings, This emanation of Chakrasamvara Will be found there. By this prediction he realized that Tilopa was his Lama for seven lifetimes. So he said: \"Why should I not search for the prophesied Lama?\" He then searched for Tilopa for one month, but could not find him, so he said: I could not find the prophesied Lama Buddha, I must be deceived by maras. Again he heard a celestial sound which said: Search for the Lama. You will find him If you do not remain in the mara of laziness. So he continued his search, enduring the twelve lesser hardships: 1. Travelling along a narrow precipice between a rocky place and a river, he encountered a leprous woman. \"Please step aside,\" he said, and she replied: All is inseparable and unending, Without boundary or conception. With thoughts of clean and unclean You cannot find the Lama. So saying, she disappeared with a snap of the fingers and Naropa fell unconscious. When he regained consciousness, there was no precipice or leprous woman to be found. 2. He then wandered into a desert where he saw a dog whose body was crawling with maggots. As the dog blocked the road, he stepped over him, and the dog said: All the sentient beings of the six realms Have the nature of one's parents. Without cultivating great compassion And entering into the Mahayana path You cannot find the Lama, even if you search."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS He said, \"How is this true?\" The dog replied: You cannot find the Lama As long as you regard others as inferior. With this he disappeared. 3. Continuing his search, Naropa met a man pounding another's head. He asked: \"Have you seen Tilopa?\" The man replied, \"Please help me to pound this man's head and I will tell you.\" Naropa thought, \"I cannot pound the head of a man,\" and he refused. The man said, \"In the teachings on great compassion, if one does not pound the head of ego with the hammer of egolessness, one cannot find the Lama,\" and with a snap of the fingers he disappeared. 4. Again Naropa continued his search. This time he met a man pulling out the intestines of another and chopping them with a sword. He asked, \"Have you seen Tilopa?\" The man replied, \"Help me to chop these and I will tell you.\" When Naropa refused, the man said: If, with the sword of unborn Dharmata, You don't cut the continuous intestine of samsara, You cannot find the Lama. With this he disappeared. 5. Naropa continued his search, and meeting a man clean, ing the inside of another's body, he asked, \"Have you seen Tilopa?\" The man replied, \"Help me with this cleaning and I will tell you.\" N aropa refused and the man said: If, with the continuity of the profound teaching, You don't wash the impurity of mind's thought To achieve self,liberation from samsara, You cannot find the Lama. With this he disappeared. 6. Naropa continued his search, asking some people he met along the road if they had seen Tilopa. They replied,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"NAROPA \"Go and ask the King.\" When he did so, the King replied, \"Marry my daughter and become my subject.\" Naropa accepted the King's daughter, who later left him and went on her way. Naropa became angered and cast a spell from the fifty~first chapter of the Chakrasamvara teaching, where~ upon a celestial voice was heard saying: Aversion and hatred, Dependent on desire, Were born in the lower realms. How can you find the Lama? Are you not deceived by the illusory being? The kingdom then disappeared. 7. When N aropa continued his search, he met some ladies and asked them if they had seen Tilopa. They replied, \"There is a hunter in the mountain forest. Ask him.\" There, he saw many wild animals and met a black~skinned hunter who was chasing them with bow and arrow. Feeling great compassion for the animals, Naropa said: Plant the OM on the hunter's bow.1 The man explained his kind of hunt: The arrow of the non~attachment illusory body Is drawn from the bow of the clear light experience. On the mountain of the self~cherishing body, In the forests of samsara~habit, I, the hunter, wish to kill The wild beast of grasping and fixation. Tomorrow I will go down to the city and beg. With this he disappeared. N aropa thought: \"Tomorrow Tilopa will appear in the city.\" 8. Naropa continued his search, going to the city where he asked for Tilopa. The people replied, \"We do not know him, 1 meaning that the bow should be prevented from acting as a weapon"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"66 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS but there is a beggar inside that hut named Tilopa,\" and they pointed out a man to him who was burning lice in a fire. Naropa circumambulated him and did prostrations, asking, \"Are you Tilopa? Please accept me as your disciple and give me the teachings.\" Tilopa replied: For all the sentient beings of the three realms In the pervasive path of Dharmata The concept of lice arises. Self,born and self,nurturing, If you do not kill such lice, How can you find the Lama? I am the fisherman Gyatso. With this he disappeared. 9. Naropa thought he might find Tilopa near a river, so he journeyed on, meeting two elderly householders plowing the field. Their two sons were gathering up ants from the ground, and the woman was fishing. When Naropa asked if they had seen Tilopa they replied, \"First, it is the hour to eat, so let us prepare food.\" The woman cooked a fish and offered it to him, but Naropa refused to eat it. With a snap of the fingers the old lady caused the fish to fly up in the air and said: If you do not eat the fish,like afflicting emotion of thoughts, Which run after enjoyment, How can you find the unborn Lama? It is hard to have a Lama When the mind is bound by thought. I depart now to kill my parents. With this she disappeared. Naropa thought, \"Perhaps tomor, row I will meet someone who is killing his parents.\" 10. Naropa was determined to continue his search, whether or not he found the teacher. On the way, he met a man who was impaling his father with a stick and locking his mother in a dungeon. When he asked the man about Tilopa, the man replied, \"If you help me to kill my parents, I will then help"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"NAROPA you.\" When N aropa refused, thinking such an action would create heavy negative karma, the man said: If you do not kill the parents of grasping and fixation Which are the cause of birth in the ocean of samsara, How can you ever find the Lama, even if you search? I depart now to watch the spectacle. With this he disappeared. Naropa thought, \"Tomorrow I will see a man watching a spectacle.\" 11. Naropa continued his search. In a country inhabited by one-eyed men, he saw corpses fanning themselves, blind men peering, deaf men hearing, dumb men speaking, and lame men running. When he asked one of the one-eyed men if he had seen Tilopa, the man replied, \"Generally, I have not seen Tilopa. If you truly wish to search for him, attend the lineage Lama in your heart.\" In the proper vessel of the devoted disciple Devotion and confidence should grow within the mind And raise the sword of the realized view. The meditation horse of bliss and clarity gallops; The action knot of grasping and fixation is loosened; The sun of self-clarity grows warmer. Blaze the fire of the great bliss experience And look on the realization of the wish-fulfilling gem. The dumb speak, saying nothing; The deaf hear, understanding nothing; The blind see, perceiving nothing; The lame run, standing still; And the lifeless unborn ones fan themselves, Creating the wind without basis. The one eye is the single taste of all. In this way he manifested the signs ofMahamudra. Naropa, not understanding his meaning, thought of asking to be his disciple, but the man disappeared."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"68 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS 12. Again Naropa continued his search, this time in a mountain known as Awakara in Parata Gyen. Although he met these emanations of the Lama, he grew discouraged, thinking: \"I have not seen the Lama because of my negative tendencies which have not been purified.\" And he sang this lament: Though following the prophecy of the Dakinis And giving up the place Where the root of all the teachings is, Separating from friends who have the three vows And disregarding the advice of my counsellors, I have not found the Lama, even by enduring mental suffering. This body is creating obstacles. Therefore why not search for the Lama By giving up this body? With this he raised his sword and tried to kill himself. But from the sky a voice spoke: By killing the Buddha How can you find the Lama? Mendicant, perhaps I am the being you seek. Naropa looked into the sky and wept. Overcome with emo, tion, he folded his hands at his heart and said: Like a cloud in the sky, you are always changing. I, though searching, could not find the precious one. Alas! Will you not look on me with compassion? Allow me to follow you. Tilopa replied, \"From the beginning I have followed you like a shadow. But because of your obscurations you did not see me. Your name will be Drime Ziji (Stainless Dignity). You, Drime Ziji, Are the wish,fulfilling tantra, The secret teaching of the Dakinis. Now you have become a proper vessel for the precious instructions."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"NAROPA Thus he spoke, and chose him as his disciple. Then Tilopa gave him the Nine Teachings of the Formless Dakin is which are the great qualities of the family of the proper vessel. B. The Four Explanations to Realize the Superior Qualities 1) Vajradhara Explains Non--returning: The sign of bliss Showing the source of bliss, That which shows the path of enlightenment To all sentient beings, The Lord of beings, Possessor of the eye of Dharma Is non~returning. 2) Explanation by the Yidam Deity: At midnight in the Pullahari Monastery, Chakrasamvara said: The Lama (Naropa) is like a great tree Which has the nature of the unborn body; He is attended by disciples, like birds. Naropa possesses the unborn body. The Lama is like a great river Which is the stream of the stainless teaching; He purifies the stain of afflicting emotions. Naropa possesses the inexpressible speech. The Lama is like space Which is like the sun of wisdom, Free from obscuration. He dispels the darkness of all sentient beings. Naropa possesses the non~conceptual mind. 3) The Lama Also Explains the Disciple as a Proper Vessel: All the disciples of Tilopa then asked, \"You are a great saint, immaterial like a cloud in the sky. Therefore, whom should one attend if one searches for peace?\" Tilopa said:"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"70 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Naropa, unforgetting recollection, Attended me during twelve hardships; He has my suchness. The future searcher of teachings Will attend Naropa If he wishes to have the realizations. 4) Naropa, Himself, Explains the Self~liberated One The path of Mahamudra Not objectified in the mind, Free from elaboration and inexpressible, Realizes the primordial wisdom With the unobstructed mind. Because of this There is no need to ask anyone. I am the self~liberated yogin, The appearance of nonduality. This ends the outer aspect, in which Naropa was recognized as a proper vessel by enduring the hardship of searching for the outer prophecy. II. THE INNER ASPECT Enduring the hardships of practice, N aropa reveals the mean~ ing of the signs. The inner aspect has two parts: (A) opening the maturing path empowerment, and (B) kindling the light of method of the liberation path. A Opening the Maturing Path Empowennent Sitting on an empty plain, Tilopa began pounding pegs into the ground. He remained silent, his mind in the nondual state. Naropa did prostrations, circumambulated him, and making mandala offerings requested instruction. Tilopa then manifested thirteen signs whose meaning Naropa under~ stood and explained: To the Lama, who is like a precious gem, One should have unchanging faith and devotion."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"NAROPA One's mind should be clear as a crystal, And drink the stream of the stainless instructions, Loosening the knot of the eight dharmas of this life. Many water vessels have but one taste; Appearances are like a rainbow, Without real substance. The Dharmakara is unborn; The reflection in the mirror is emptiness~bliss. The Dharmakaya drop exists in oneself; The knot is free from expression, thought and speech; The dumb explain details without words; The tree ripens the fruit naturally. Tilopa said: You explain the thirteen knots of signs. You are a being who understands the signs, The wish~fulfilling gem of the secret Tantra, The secret teachings of the Dakinis. Look at the mirror of wisdom teachings, The empowerment which ripens those who are not ripe. Naropa said: How can I, who am blind, see, Obscured as I am by the darkness of ignorance? Tilopa replied: Look on that which cannot be seen. In the nature of the unseen Liberate those without liberation. The yogin will be liberated By seeing the meaning. Naropa said: Retrieve the precious gem of the mind From the ocean of samsara By depending on the ship of the Lama. 71"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Seeing the maturing path I, the yogin, am happy. Tilopa, seeing that Naropa was attached to the teachings, said: The instructions are only a sign, Leading to yet greater happiness. Do not be attached to the teachings of the Lama. Tilopa then gave the vase empowerment to Naropa's body, showing the contents and container as the mandala of the enlightened deities, or as appearance without existence. He then gave empowerment to his speech and showed undefiled bliss. He next gave the wisdom empowerment to his mind and showed the self,awareness co,emergent wisdom. He finally gave the empowerment to the three gates and showed the inexpressible mahamudra. Setting fire to the edge of a piece of cloth, he caused the entire cloth to go up in flames. When he asked Naropa if he understood, Naropa replied, \"In one moment the Third Wisdom Empowerment burned the afflicting emotions of samsara as a flame does a piece of cloth.\" So Naropa was liberated by developing non,attachment. At this time he said: The meaning of empowerment, Like the spark of a fire, Burns the cloth of afflicting emotion. I am content. B. Kindling the Ught of Method of the Uberation Path By undergoing the twelve major hardships, Naropa receives the teachings. 1. Jumping from the roof of the Otantra temple, Tilopa said, \"If you want teachings, come after me. If I had a disciple, he would jump from this roof.\" Naropa thought, \"He must be telling me I should jump.\" When he landed, he"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"NAROPA 73 felt intense pain. Hearing his moans, Tilopa said, \"What has happened to you?\" Naropa replied: This clay pot of a body, fully ripened, This broken vessel is like a corpse. Tilopa said: This clay pot of a body, self~cherishing, May be broken, Naropa. Look at the mirror of the mind Through the lineage Of the wish~fulfilling gem of the Secret Tantra, The Secret Teachings of the Dakinis. At this time he was given the wish~fulfilling gem of the teachings of the four lineages. On these he meditated one year. 2. Naropa made an offering again, did prostrations and requested further teachings. Tilopa said, \"Come after me,\" and Naropa followed. Tilopa then asked him to jump into three giant loads of burning sandalwood which were heaped up. When Naropa emerged from the fire badly burned, Tilopa asked, \"What has happened to you?\" Naropa replied: The wheel of the sandalwood fire Brings pain to the body, inseparable from the flame. Tilopa said: The fuel of the body of self~cherishing May be burned, Naropa. Look at the mirror of the samaya mind, The wish~fulfilling gem of the Secret Tantra, The Secret Teachings of the Dakinis. At this time he was given the instructions of the wish~ fulfilling samaya. On these he meditated for one year. 3. Naropa again requested further teachings and Tilopa said, \"Make a bridge with your body over this river filled with"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"74 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS leeches.\" Naropa obeyed so that Tilopa could cross the river, but he fell into the water. Tilopa said, \"What happened to you?\" Naropa replied: I fell into the water; Leeches go through my body, Therefore I suffer, without any choice. Tilopa said: The river of body~cherishing May be drowned, Naropa. Look at the mirror of the common mind, The wish~fulfilling gem of the Secret Tantra, The Secret Teachings of the Dakinis. At this time he was given the complete teachings of the generating~arising process. 4. After one year Naropa again requested further teach~ ings and Tilopa said, \"If you need teachings, bring me a bamboo stick, fire and oil.\" Tilopa then poured oil on the bamboo, heated the stick in the fire, and pierced Naropa's body in many places. When Naropa cried out in pain, Tilopa said, \"What has happened to you?\" and Naropa replied: This body is composed of the knot of grasping and fixation. Therefore I suffer. Tilopa said: The knot of this karmically ripened body May be destroyed, Naropa. The Secret Teachings of the Dakinis Are the wish~fulfilling Tantra. Look in the mirror of the mental heat and bliss. At this time he was given the complete instructions for Tummo. 5. After one year Naropa again requested further teach~ ings, and Tilopa, who was residing in a cave, told him,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"NAROPA 75 \"Bring me cooked rice.\" Naropa went off and begged rice from a family entertaining a large company of guests. When he returned and offered it, Tilopa smacked his lips with pleasure, ate heartily, and said, \"Bring me more.\" Naropa said, \"They may not give me more.\" In reply Tilopa gave him a mirror, a chain, a vase filled with water, and a pot, with the instructions, \"If they are unwilling to give you more, take it by force.\" Naropa returned to the same place and saw that the guests had gone outside. Entering the empty house, he came upon a pot of rice which looked even more delicious than that which he had been given before. This he took away with him. Seeing what he was doing, the guests chased him. But Naropa threw the mirror at them, which was transformed into a lake, separating him from the angry throng. When they continued to follow in their boats, he threw the chain at them, which was transformed into a mighty mountain. Still, the people followed him, climbing the mountain. He then threw the vase of water at them, which was transformed into an enormous river. But the crowd crossed the river. Then he threw the pot at them, which was transformed into an iron hut in which he hid himself. Unable to enter, the people built a sandalwood fire around the hut. When the heat became intolerable, Naropa left the hut and the people fell upon him, beating him fiercely. just then Tilopa appeared, saying, \"What has happened to you?\" Naropa replied: I have been pounded like rice And squeezed like a mustard seed. Therefore I suffer. The copper of this karmically ripened body May be beaten, N aropa. The Secret Teachings of the Dakinis Are the wish-fulfilling Tantra. Look in the mirror of the mental dream. At this time Naropa was given the instructions of the dream which is the self-clarifying confusion."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"76 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Tilopa said: 6. After a year Naropa again requested further teachings. Just then a Princess was carried past in a sedan chair, and Tilopa asked Naropa to pull her down and drag her about. When he did so, the King's ministers fell on him, beating him nearly senseless. Tilopa said, \"What has happened to you?\" N aropa replied: The minister, like an artist lacking compassion, Grinds me to powder as he would his paint. Therefore I suffer. Tilopa replied: This mountain of a self~cherishing body May be broken, Naropa. The Secret Teachings of the Dakinis Are the wish~fulfilling Tantra. Look at the mirror of the unchanging object. At this time Naropa was given the instructions of entering into the Phowa Trong~jug siddhi. 1 7. After one year N aropa requested further teachings and followed Tilopa onto an empty plain where a man was carrying a load on his back. Tilopa commanded Naropa, \"Chase this man and beat him.\" When N aropa tried to obey, he found that the man kept retreating like a mirage. Seeing Naropa's exhaustion, Tilopa said, \"What has happened to you?\" Naropa replied: I am like an animal chasing a mirage. Chasing that which does not exist, I suffer.

Tilopa said, \"Follow me.\" While they were on the road there appeared a Minister leading his bride on an elephant. \"Abduct the bride and drag her on the ground,\" Tilopa said. \"Then I will give you the teachings.\" When Naropa had carried out Tilopa's order, the Minister beat him almost to the point of death. As Naropa lay on the ground crying out in pain, Tilopa appeared, blessed him, and dispelled his suffering. 9. After a year N aropa made a mandala offering and requested further teachings. Tilopa said, \"If you want the teachings, follow me.\" When they reached an empty plain, Naropa saw a richly adorned Prince riding a chariot which was guarded by many soldiers. Tilopa said, \"Steal the Prince's ornaments and pull him from his chariot by the hair. Then I will give you the teachings.\" When Naropa obeyed, the Prince's guards fell on him with arrows and stones. When Naropa was near the point of death, Tilopa appeared, blessed him, and dispelled all his suffering. 10. After a year Naropa made a mandala offering and requested further teachings. Tilopa said, \"Seek a consort and I will give you the teachings.\" Naropa found a beautiful woman of devoted temperament with whom he lived happily for a time, but later she made many difficulties for him. Tilopa appeared and asked, \"Does all go well with you?\" Naropa replied: I suffer, laboring constantly Under the grasping and fixation Of dual appearance."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"78 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Tilopa said: In the non,duality of samsara and nirvana Labor may exist, Naropa. 11.

Making a show of anger, Tilopa beat the woman, but still Naropa remained tireless in his devotion. Nor did there arise in him wrong view; indeed, the merit of offering his consort to Tilopa caused him to rejoice. Tilopa asked, \"Does all go well with you?\" Naropa replied: Without expectations I offer the wisdom consort To the Lama Buddha. Therefore I, the yogin, rejoice. Tilopa said: In the great path of Dharma,as,Such It is well to be happy, Naropa. III. THE SECRET ASPECT Enduring the hardship of offering the cherished body, Naropa kindles the light of bliss. The secret aspect has two parts: (A) blazing the light of bliss, the twelfth trial; and (B) blazing the light of stainlessness. A Blazing the Ught of Bliss 12. After enduring these major sufferings for twelve years, Naropa made a mandala offering and requested further teach, ings. journeying to a place shrouded by a dust storm, he settled the debris with his own blood and made an offering heap of his eyes, nose, tongue and limbs.

I, the yogi, fare well. Tilopa said: The contaminated, essenceless body May be offered, N aropa. The Secret Teachings of the Dakinis Are the wish,fulfilling Tantra. Look in the mirror of the nondual mind. Naropa said: I am blinded by the darkness of ignorance; How can I see? Tilopa replied: Look at that which cannot be seen. Within the unseen The yogi, seeing the meaning, is self,liberated. 79 After going through the twelve hardships, Naropa was given the Phowa teachings. Until this time he had experienced only minor sufferings. Hereafter, he experienced no mental suffering, thus becoming like Sadaprarudita. B. Blazing the Stainless Ught Naropa remained within that which cannot be seen and was liberated within the unseen. Offering his realization to Tilopa, he said: The precious gem of the mind Depends on the vessel of the Lama. Liberated from the ocean Of the Three Realms of samsara, I, the yogin, fare well, Seeing the meaning of nonduality."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Bo THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Realizing that Naropa was attached to the substance of the teachings, Tilopa said: The method of proceeding From joy to greater joy Is to be unattached To the substance of the Lama's teaching. Naropa replied: Liberated in the unseen by non,grasping, Burning the cloth of afflicting emotions With the spark of nonduality, I fare well. Thus he achieved the effortless Mahamudra realization, the twelve interdependent links and their reverse order. IV. THE ULTIMATE ASPECf Enduring the hardship of disobeying orders, N aropa achieves the result. The ultimate aspect consists of two parts: (A) directly achieving the realization of the fruit, and (B) receiv, ing the prophecy of the Lama. A Directly Achieving the Realization of the Fruit Naropa received all the teachings, did prostrations, and departed. One day Tilopa appeared in the sky and said: By sitting, the blind cannot see form; By sitting, the dumb cannot speak; By sitting, the deaf cannot hear; By sitting, the lame cannot walk; By sitting, the root of the tree cannot remain stable; By sitting, one cannot realize Mahamudra. Naropa understood that he must now put the teachings into action. Taking up an empty skullcup, he set out to beg. On the road he met a child who was expert in reading the signs."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"NAROPA BI This child gave him a burning sword. When Naropa put the sword in his skullcup, it melted and he ate it. Everyone was amazed and the news travelled until it reached King Dawang. To test Naropa and see if he were truly a realized yogi, the king caused a large army to advance on him. Making the threatening mudra, Naropa destroyed the entire force. The King then sent a drunken, raging elephant to Naropa, which Naropa also killed with the threatening mudra. As the King and the entire country mourned the death of the elephant, Naropa asked that a hole be dug in which to place the beast. Through the practice of phowa siddhis, he then caused his consciousness to enter the elephant's body, thus ending the sadness of the people. In this way his fame spread in all directions, and the King, offering him his daughter, reverently requested the teachings. When Naropa engaged in hunting and other activities, the King said, \"I will provide you with whatever you need, so please cease hunting.\" But Naropa refused to listen. The monks of Shravaka told the King, \"If you continue to make Naropa the object of your reverence, we will go elsewhere.\" So the King allied himself with the monks and agreed to persecute Naropa. First, however, they asked the King's daughter to leave, but when she refused to do so they bound her to Naropa with cords. They then hurled weapons at the two, shouting curses at them, ar.d hitting them with ham, mers. The crowd even made a fence of swords and wheels around them and created a sandalwood fire, but Naropa and his consort, unaffected, began dancing. After seven days, when everyone thought that N aropa and the Princess must be destroyed even to their bones, they went to check. But the two were floating in space in union in the Heruka form, holding the bell and vajra, having the nature of the rainbow body. N aropa said: The wheel of sandal fire Helps to bum the tree trunk of ego; The wheel of weapons Helps to cut the continuous rope of samsara;"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS The wheel of harsh words Helps to build the armor of patience; The knot of the karma of hatred Helps to loosen the knot of the three poisons; The hammer of morality Helps to pound the demon of ego. Taking the life of others carelessly, If not against the three vows And not a cause to be born in the lower realms, Is the great company ofNaropa's action. The King then had a dream in which he fell through a crack in the earth to a hell~realm where he stayed for many years. Shot by the bow of the eight worldly dharmas, The arrow of the Lama Sent me to the three lower realms. This I saw in my dream. I beg the pardon of the Lama for my errors. Just as King Ashoka purified his negative karma, So do I ask to be forgiven my intolerable error. The life of King Ashoka clarifies the meaning of King Dawang's dream. The latter asked Naropa, \"What was the most meritorious action King Ashoka performed in his life?\" And Naropa replied, \"In a single morning he built ten million stupas consecrated by ten million arahats, containing ten million relics of the Buddha.\" The King then asked, \"And what is the heaviest negative karma one can perform?\" His teacher said, \"To divide the sangha, burn temples, or let the mind be burned by the fire of grasping and fixation; also, to show disrespect toward the Lama, revile him, use the wealth of the sangha wrongly, divide the country, gain one's livelihood by selling precious texts, and decline the antidote of wrong view. All these constitute the most negative actions, which will cause one to be reborn in the hell realms for seventy~two thousand, five hundred kalpas.

He also explained how negative karma can be purified: Abandon your attachment to country, purify negative karma, and realize the meaning of the unborn. King Dawang again begged Naropa's forgiveness for his behavior, saying, \"The result of my actions appeared in my dream. So I beg forgiveness for all my faults. Please consent to purify me.\" Naropa replied: Loosen the knot of this life's eight dharmas; Annihilate the forces of darkness and ignorance; Dry the mind of the three poisonous samsaras; Kindle the wisdom light of the regretful mind; Confess in the unborn state. Thus, by Naropa's blessing, King Dawang was liberated. This was the accomplishment of performing the action. B. Receiving the Prophecy of the Lama Tilopa appeared in the sky saying: Not being accepted by the Lama and Dakinis, Not developing the experience and realization, Not being liberated from yearning, Do not perform action, N aropa. Naropa asked: Then should I listen to the teachings? Tilopa replied: Listening to the teachings Is like drinking salt water. It cannot free one from desire, Naropa.

Tilopa replied: Not perceiving non~observation, There is nothing to see in reality, Naropa. Naropa asked: Then should I achieve the result? Tilopa replied: When one is free from the duality of hope and fear There is no fruit to achieve, Naropa. Naropa felt confused, and said: The nature of form is appearance; It is not inherently born.

In the great bliss Of the spontaneously accomplished one, If there is virtue and non~virtue There is a reason to ripen the result of happiness and suffering. In the nature of the equality state, Why accept virtue and reject non~virtue? Tilopa replied: Until you realize the nature of the unborn, The interdependent origination of appearance, Do not abandon the chariot wheel Of the two accumulations, Naropa.

In the unborn, free from elaboration, Freely enjoy. If you realize this temporal experience Of recollection and introspection as illusion, Be carefree, Naropa.

Tilopa then sealed this prophecy with three commands: \"Do not preach in the assembly; do not debate with heretics; do not give empowerments to the King. From Tibet, the Land of Snow, will come a man to whom you should give the teachings.\" After a time Naropa's friend Riripa requested that he give teachings for the benefit of all sentient beings: Give up the mind of solitary peace and such, Like Shravakas and Pratyekabuddhas; Dispel the darkness of all sentient beings By the Dharma light of Naropa.

THE QUALITY OF UNDERGOING HARDSHIPS RELATED TO FAMILY In Chukhyer in the valley of Lhotrak there lived a clan known by the name of Marpa. The father was named Marpa Wangchuk Oser, whose own father, in turn, was named Konchog. The mother was Gyamo Dode. To them were born five children, two older and two younger than Marpa. Agreeing to send Marpa to Drogmi Lotsawa at Nyungu Lung Monastery in Lato Mangkhar, the parents gave him a black horse known as Senghe Khadang, bearing a saddle made from the sengdeng tree, a silken blanket, a large silver ladle, a fine piece of turquoise, and a text containing the eight thousand verses of the Prajnaparamita written in gold. Marpa was also given many other precious objects with which to obtain the teachings. But as Drogmi Lotsawa was reluctant to give teachings, Marpa received few from him. However, he learned Sanskrit and spoke with certain Indian scholars who inspired him to journey to India for further study. Meanwhile, Drogmi Lotsawa returned Marpa's horse, which he sold for six sang of gold. He then journeyed to Nepal and met the teacher Chither, who gave him the four seed Tantras and the Dharma protectress Vetali, as well as the Phowa Trong~jug, the Hevajra empowerment and the related Tantra teachings. In all, Marpa stayed in Nepal for three years to accustom himself to the heat. During this time he became friendly with Nyo Jungpo (a Tibetan translator) in whose company he journeyed to India. Nyo went to Eastern India and Marpa went to the West in search of a Lama. In the West, in the city of Lakshetra, he came upon Pandita Yeshe Nyingpo, who gave Guhyasamaja teachings.

One yogin rode in on a jackal and another appeared on a giant cat. When they were asked who they were, the yogins said, \"We are Kantapa and Pentapa, disci, ples ofNaropa.\" Marpa then received teachings from them, especially from Pentapa, remaining in that place five years. By this time all that he had brought with him was nearly used up, so he went to Nepal and met men bringing supplies from Tibet. From there he returned to India and met many lamas, in particular Yeshe Nyingpo and Pen tapa, who treated him with great kindness. To each of them Marpa offered a mandala made with one sang of gold. Pen tapa was so pleased that he took Marpa to meet N aropa at Pullahari Monastery. At that time there were four Gatekeeper scholars in Nalanda: the Eastern Gatekeeper was Shantipa; the South, em Gatekeeper was Ngaki Wangchuk Drakpa; the Western Gatekeeper was Sherab Jungne Bapa; and the Northern Gatekeeper was Pullaharipa (Naropa). Pentapa pointed out Naropa as the peerless one among them, and so it came to pass that Marpa met Naropa, offering him a gold mandala and requesting the teachings. Naropa manifested the nine deities ofHevajra and gave Marpa the empowerment, as well as teachings and instructions related to the Hevajra tantra. Later, Marpa met Lord Maitripa in the East, near the Ganga River at Radiant Flower Monastery atop Blazing Fire Mountain. From him he received Hevajra teachings, Tapa Lurlang, and the essence of the Mahamudra. He then returned to Naropa and requested the Mahamaya teachings. Naropa said, \"Though I am expert in this teaching, I must send you to another lama who possesses the essence of the teaching.\" Pleased with the ganachakra feast Marpa had offered, Naropa turned to three of his realized disciples and said, \"This Tibetan will travel to an island in the poisoned lake to"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"102 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS receive Mahamaya teachings from Shiwa Sangpo [Kukuripa].

Again he said, \"If you are Shiwa Sangpo, then give me the teachings.\" Shiwa Sangpo smiled and said, \"Are you angered that I am challenging the name ofNaropa?\" Marpa replied that he was. Shiwa Sangpo then declared, \"That is a sign that Naropa is your root Lama. Now, let us go,\" and he led Marpa to his dwelling place. For two weeks he gave Marpa the empowerments, and then said, \"When you return, you will be able to do so through thought alone, by the power of my blessing. Simply make supplications.\" Marpa did as he was instructed.

Once Marpa went to a town where he met Nyo. The two challenged each other to a debate over the teachings they had received. When Nyo was defeated he asked, \"Who is your Lama?\" Marpa said: To the inferior he is but a form; To the profound he is a mantra; But to the ultimate, the yogi of the Dharma Is the Lama who shows the path of liberation. Naropa then gave Marpa the Guhyasamaja. Before he left for Tibet, Marpa performed a ganachakra feast. While offering the torma with his right hand, Naropa placed his left hand on the crown ofMarpa's head and said, \"You will have to return to India once more, and this will be the sign: The flower being of the sky Rides on the horse of the barren woman's son, Which is reined with the hair of a turtle.

The dumb speak and the blind see; The deaf hear and the lame run; The sun and moon dance and the conch shell sounds; The wheel and a small child spin.\" Marpa then journeyed to Bodh'gaya to make offerings, and there met Nyo. Together they went to see Lama Bhalingsarya who transmitted the teachings of the Tantras of Manjushri,"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"104 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Yamantaka, Hevajra, Nama Sangiti, and Guhyasamaja. Marpa remained there seven years, thus staying in India twelve years in all. With Nyo, Marpa went to Nepal where he met the son of Lama Drogmi, who expressed amazement at his realizations. In reply, Marpa sang a song about the wondrous teachings he had received. Then he came to Lato Tshoshi (Western Tibet) where he paid homage to Drogmi. Many people gathered to watch the three translators as they sat side by side. Drogmi thought, \"If I had given Marpa all the teach, ings and empowerments when he first came to see me, he would have become my disciple and follower.\" In this way he was filled with regret. Then Marpa travelled to Central Tibet where his great teachings caused talk of him to spread widely. At that time gold was being mined in Namra, so Marpa received many golden offerings. III. THE QUALITY OF THE EXPERIENCE OF SAMADHI This section has six aspects: (A) revealing and invoking the sign, (B) the prophecy of seeing the Lama, (C) blowing the breath of compassion, (D) being chosen by the Lama as predicted, (E) showing himself as self,liberated and (F) revealing his gift of samadhi. A Revealing and Invoking the Sign From Phenyul came Marpa Golek who offered Marpa Lotsawa ten sang of gold and forty sang,worth of silks and other precious items. At this time Marpa revealed the signs as predicted by Naropa: The flower dakini of the sky Rides on the horse of the barren hearing lineage Which is reined with the inexpressible turtle's hair. With the hom of an unborn hare She kills the preconception in the Dharma expanse."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"MARPA With the inexpressible unspoken speech of the dumb Tilo Blind Naro liberates, seeing the unseen meaning. The lame discrimination of the deafNaropa Neither comes nor goes On the mountain ofDharmakaya, Dharma,as,Such.

The wheel is Chakrasamvara, And the child is non,grasping. The wheel of the hearing lineage spins. B. The Prophecy of Seeing the Lama 105 Marpa returned to India bearing sixty sang of gold. On the way he traversed Nepal, where he met his previous teachers and made offerings. Learning that Naropa had entered the action 1 he journeyed to the city of Lakshetra in the West and asked for Yeshe Nyingpo who was staying in a forest, attended by a woman of low caste. \"When she comes to gather water,\" he was told, \"ask her if you may see him.\" When she arrived, he made his request. Pointing to a large jar of water she was holding, she said, \"Use one, third of this water to bathe, and one, third for drinking.\" After Marpa had finished bathing, the washing water fell back into the vase and transformed into his white seed,essence (hindu). The woman then performed a yogic exercise over the vase and from her secret place emanated a stream of red seed,essence. After the two essences had merged and Marpa bathed in the water again, all his preconceived thoughts dissolved. And when he drank the water and looked into the vase he saw the full assemblage of the Guhyasamaja deities. Then Yeshe Nyingpo appeared and Marpa did prostrations 1 meaning: achieved the stage where he could dissolve or reappear at will"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"106 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS before him. Yeshe Nyingpo asked, \"Are you liberated from the bondage of afflicting emotions? Are you purified? Have you realized the meaning of suchness ?\" He then gave him the four empowerments, the teachings of the illusory body, the clear light and others. From there Marpa returned to the island in the boiling, poisonous lake to the South where dwelt Shiwa Sangpo. Together they performed a ganachakra feast during which a woman brought in a corpse. She cut the skull from the head and in it mixed the urine of Shiwa Sangpo with the blood of the corpse. This samaya fluid was then offered to all the assembly, and when it was brought to Marpa, it was boiling. Looking into it, Marpa saw the mantra syllables of the Mahamaya and realized the yogin of the profound mantra. At the ultimate he realized the meaning of the Suchness and remained seven days in stainless samadhi. While in this state, he also studied the meaning of the four yogas and received the teachings of Gyuma Sangyii. After this he performed a ganachakra feast for one month, and Shiwa Sangpo said: I dreamed that the glorious Naropa With the glance of an elephant Radiated the light of the sun and the moon Toward Tibet from his two eyes. So you will meet Naropa. Thus predicted Shiwa Sangpo. A Dakini then led Marpa to the East where Lord Maitripa was staying at the Cemetery of Blazing Fire Mountain. There, all the corpses, though moldy, putrid, and half burned, laughed, whistled, and made other sounds. The fire of the cremation ground, which was dark green, created a cloud of smoke in the sky which caused an epidemic wherever it travelled. For this reason the place is called Blazing Fire Mountain Cemetery. When Marpa saw Maitripa sitting under the shade of a nyagrota tree, he performed an offering to please the Dakinis,"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"MARPA 107 as well as a mandala offering to please the Lama. With one,pointed mind he made supplications and received the Topa Lurlang T antra, the Hevajra T antra, and the Mahamudra teaching. Thus, he was established in the nature of the original mind. At this time the glorious nonduality Avadhutipa (Maitripa) accepted Marpa as a disciple and gave him the four empower, ments of the inner profound signs. As a result, he progressed through the basic ground motivation, achieved the stainless samadhi, attained the unchanging state for seven days, and established the ground path, the three kayas. Different signs appeared: inanimate objects came to life; two red emanation jackals accepted a torma; the Formless Dakinis of the upper, lower, and middle realms began speaking; and all of space was pervaded by local Dharma protectors making music. Maitripa prophesied that Marpa should go to the Land of Snow in the North where there would be many proper vessels. There Marpa celebrated a ganachakra feast for a month, and Maitripa said: I dreamed of a captain sailing a ship And raising the jewel atop the victorious banner; Of a youthful girl glancing in a mirror And a bird flying and raising a banner. You will meet N aropa. In the region of the Water Tree Rosary, Marpa performed a ganachakra feast one hundred times before Yogini Bone Ornament, from whom he took the teaching of the Four, Seat Vajra. Yogini Bone Ornament said: I dreamed of someone blowing conch shells From the peaks of three mountains: Of the road leading from the three junctions of the valley. By the lamp blazing in the vase The whole earth is illuminated. You will meet N aropa."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"108 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Thus she prophesied. For the novice attendant ofNaropa, Sherab Sangye, and other of his followers Marpa performed the ganachakra feast, asking them to seek prophetic dreams. All obtained dreams containing signs that Marpa would meet Naropa. He then performed a ganachakra feast for a month with Gezul Sherab Sangye who said: I dreamed of leading a blind person From the great plain of suffering, And entrusting him to another Who dispelled the error of sightlessness By showing him the mirror of the mind. You will meet glorious Naropa. Thus prophesied Gezul Sherab Sangye. Then Marpa performed a ganachakra feast for a month before Riripa who said: I dreamed the same dream as the Dharma King. The noble family of the Dharma King Was supplicating the Brahmin Sangshap And established the noble virtues. You will meet Naropa. Thus prophesied Riripa. Marpa then performed a ganachakra feast for a month before Kasoripa who said: The mirror of Dharmakaya, Mind~as~Such, Is like the completely pure circle of the moon. This unshakable meaning Will be shown in Pullahari by N aropa. Thus prophesied Kasoripa. C. Blowing the Breath of Compassion Marpa searched for a month, and when he arrived at Rower Heap Monastery, he dreamed that Lord Naropa was riding a lion atop a sun and moon disk in the heavens,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"MARPA 109 surrounded by two consorts. When Marpa made the suppli-cations, Naropa offered this reply: I, Naro, have entered into the nonduality, Being supported by two consorts Revealing the signs of method and wisdom, Riding on a lion, And singing and dancing on sun and moon disks. Are you not deceived by your deluded dreams? That day when Marpa looked into the sky, he saw Nampa's form clearly like a rainbow, and he supplicated the master who made this reply: If the steed of continuity, confidence and devotion Is not spurred on by the whip of perseverance, The wild beast of grasping and fixation May be trapped and condemned to wander in the net ofsamsara. With this Naropa disappeared. Marpa ran after him, but though he caught sight of him, the vision ofNaropa kept on retreating. Exhausted, Marpa lamented: Alas, Lord, will you not, in your compassion, look on me? Will you abandon him who is without refuge? I offer my life to the Lama. Please heed this confused, ignorant one. Thus he supplicated, looking into the heavens. In the mist of a dark mountain he saw the Lama and followed after him, entering into a rocky enclosure in the mountain. From the sky a voice came forth saying: All things are like the appearance of illusion. Clarity and emptiness are without definition. Your mind is confused in its solitude. This is the nature of the relative. Naropa disappeared like a bird in flight and Marpa, who"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"110 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS could do nothing but gaze at the sky, said: Lord like a bird in flight, If I do not understand that which is without definition, I am like a dog chasing a bird's shadow, Wandering near the precipice meaninglessly, am I not? Thus he spoke and leapt into the air with the thought: \"The Lama goes to no definite place, so where can I search?\" From out of space he heard a voice: Everything is unborn. In the Dharmata, Dharmakaya, Mind,as,Such, If one does not loosen the serpent,knot of hesitation, Then, like a two,pointed needle, One accomplishes nothing. Marpa, following after Naropa's disappearing form, saw the Lama's body in space. Joyfully, he supplicated Naropa who said: The non,attachment body is like a rainbow. If one cannot see it in the unseen state, Then, like a blind man looking at a spectacle, One cannot realize its meaning. Thus he spoke and disappeared. Marpa then went to the Mountain of Darkness where he saw the Lama's footprint on the Marvelous Crystal Rock. He built a bridge for himself and saw a self,arising blossoming lotus at the River of Various Daisies. Later, he saw a white vajra of sandalwood at the Rock of Various Jewels, as well as three miraculous footprints. Climbing to the top of the mountain near the Flat Square Rock, he supplicated Naropa for seven days. When the Lama appeared, Marpa did prostra, tions and offered a ganachakra feast. Naropa stirred the nectar in the skullcup with a spoon made of a rib, and gave"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"MARPA III what was left to Marpa, who experienced the eight excellent tastes. N aropa said: The great bliss enjoyment of one taste Lies in the great vessel of bliss. If one does not enjoy the great bliss, The nectar of enjoyment will not appear. Then Marpa searched for another month and saw the nine Hevajra deities on a sandalwood tree, as well as the eight, syllable mantra revolving at the heart center of the Yogini, and a footprint on the Crystal Rock. Supplicating further, he met Naropa in his actual body, and offering the Lama a gold mandala requested teachings. Naropa said: If one does not offer the Dharmata mandala On the ground of equality-Appearance, pure from the beginning-Then the jewel mandala of grasping May be pulled into the life of samsara, Is this not so? So saying, he refused the mandala. Again, Marpa offered it, and Naropa threw it into the air, saying: I offer this to the Lama And the Triple Gem. Marpa felt regret and Naropa, reading his mind, said, \"If you need that gold, you can have it all.\" And with his miracle powers he retrieved the gold and returned it to Marpa. When Marpa sprinkled gold dust over N aropa, part of it fell onto his hair and part into his skullcup. The portion in the skullcup was transformed into nectar, which Naropa sipped. Then he stamped his feet and said, \"If you want gold, I can tum this entire world into gold merely by touching it.\" Then he disappeared. Again, Marpa searched and saw Naropa eating barley from another's bowl. He requested the teachings and Naropa, offering him the barley, said, \"Eat this.\" But Marpa refused."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"112 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Naropa then said: The great bliss enjoyment of one taste Lies in the great vessel of bliss. If one does not enjoy the great bliss, One will not experience the vessel of great bliss. So saying, he gave Marpa the essence of the Hevajra expla~ nation and the direct teaching of Panchakula, as well as the detailed and brief teachings of the Precious Secret, the Co~emergent Teaching of Vajrayogini, and others. Then he said, \"Go to Maitripa to review these teachings and obtain others.\" Marpa received further teachings from Maitripa and collected many texts. In this way the Tantras and other teachings descended from the lineages of both Naropa and Maitripa. After collecting the texts, Marpa again sought Naropa and came upon him in the Forest of the Sengdeng Tree. Realizing his own pure mind as the appearance of the Lama, he said: In the meaning one should realize the non~going and non~coming. If one does not realize non~going and non~coming In the freedom from action, Dharmata clear light, One is like a wild beast chasing a mirage, And wandering on a plain without meaning, Is this not so? D. Being Chosen by the Lama as Predicted Marpa obtained the blessing by receiving Naropa's feet and hands on the crown of his head. Naropa supplicated Tilopa who appeared in the sky and blessed Marpa, saying: By the sun of self~ liberated wisdom In the Monastery of Pullahari, Spread the light of wisdom To the being known as Lodro, Who will dispel the darkness of ignorance in Tibet."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"MARPA 113 Since Tilopa so prophesied, Naropa said, \"Let us proceed as the enlightened Lama ordered.\" So he and Marpa went on their way to Pullahari Monastery. E. Showing Himself as Self-Uberated As Naropa and Marpa went toward Pullahari Monastery the worldly Dakinis created obstacles because they could not tolerate Marpa's carrying away all their life-essence profound teachings to Tibet. Unable to dispel these obstacles, Naropa supplicated Tilopa: My son prophesied by the Lama, The proper vessel Marpa Lodro, Is beset by obstacles caused by the maras. Please grant your blessings, Lord Protector. There then appeared among the Dakinis a wrathful emana-tion of Tilopa, vast as space and bearing various weapons. In fear and trembling all the Dakinis folded their hands and said: Wrathful body and fearsome speech Bearing fearsome weapons, We take refuge in the glorious body. We are not obstructors. After seven months the chariot throne will be prepared For the glorious Lord Naropa. And from the hall of Pullahari, In the palace of the self-appearing Oddiyana, We will welcome the prophesied self-liberated one. After seven months we will invite Naropa To Oddiyana on the chariot. Thus they begged pardon of Tilopa who dissolved all his wrathful forms back into himself and transformed into the nature of rainbow light. From out of this light Marpa saw one-half of Tilopa's body and heard four verses of his teachings."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"114 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS During his seven months at Pullahari Marpa received the Guhyasamaja teachings, the teaching tradition ofNagarjuna and his disciples, instructions on the one~session meditation of Rimnga, the meaning of the Great Supreme Glorious One, the empowerment of the Precious Secret, the blessings of the Secret Sindhura Vajra Wisdom of Vajrayogini, the instruction of the Four~Sign Empowerments of the Dakinis, and the blessings of the hearing lineage of Chakrasamvara. Beneath the foundation of Pullahari Monastery Are gathered the scattered Four Tantra Teachings: In the middle of the monastery Is established the meaning of the mother Tantra; At the summit of the monastery Is taught the meaning of the father Tantra. From the nine teachings of non~form, five are taught and four should be received directly from Kasoripa. Kasoripa taught the Light of Awareness Wisdom, the Wheel of the Channel and Wind Nets, the Mirror of Outer Equalizing Taste, and the Precious Great Bliss Speech. Marpa did prostrations and circumambulated Naropa, receiving the complete empowerment of the emanation man~ dala with blessings. He placed Naropa's feet on the crown of his head, requested the footprint, and performed the ganachakra feast with offering tormas. Naropa placed his left hand on Marpa's head and prophesied: The yogin who has seen the meaning of pervading emptiness Will hold the jewel of the reigning King. The flower in the family sky will disappear, Yet the river of the teaching lineage will continue. Rim Nga has one meaning In the pervading Dharma~as~Such.

The teachings with the supreme blessings will flourish.\" Thus Naropa proph~ esied. Then he said, \"I will go to Oddiyana.\" Marpa contemplated staying in India, but Naropa, who instantly read his thought, said, \"Return to Tibet. We four yogis have given blessings in the four directions. Krishna~ charya blessed the East; Nagarjuna blessed the South; lndra~ bhuti blessed the West; and I blessed the North, the Land of Snow. Therefore, do not tarry here. Return to your country. In the North there are many proper vessels.\" Thirteen Lamas connected to the Dharma teachings, including Lama Ser~ lingpa, gave Marpa teachings and blessed him. In particular, the blessings of Naropa and Maitripa were unsurpassed. In all, Marpa spent twenty years in India, twelve with Naropa and seven with Maitripa. Of the two, Naropa was a root Lama who was unequalled, the crest ornament, and the wick of the lamp. During his return journey to Tibet Marpa spent time at Bodh'gaya, arriving during a great festival. In the day offer~ ings were made by humans, and at night offerings were made by amanushas, gods, nagas, yakshas, gandharvas, kinaras, asuras, mahoragas, rakshas, and others. One night the crowd began shouting riotously, and the next morning a giant raksha, whose head measured sixteen feet across, was found dead. To calm the frightened people Marpa performed the Phowa Trong~jug and threw the body in the direction of the Tokmo Rock. Everyone manifested their gratitude. Marpa then went to each of his Lamas to bid them fare~ well. The last was Shiwa Sangpo, who lived at Halaparpata in the poison lake. To him Marpa sang a long song which caused tears to come to the eyes of all who heard it. When"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"116 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Marpa crossed the Ganga, two low~caste robbers, Shikyipa, began chasing him. Taking fright, he visualized the Lama seated on the crown of his head, whereupon he became invisible to the robbers, who turned back. Marpa felt bound~ less gratitude toward his Lamas, and grew in confidence and devotion for them all. Marpa then went to a place near the Ganga called Paciltra, where he met a lady guarding an orchard. When he asked her for fruit, she replied, \"Ask my mother.\" When he did so he found that the woman was a yogini. With the blazing mudra she caused all the fruits-grapes, apples and others-to fall to the ground. When Marpa opened one fruit and looked inside, he saw directly the fifteen perfected female deities from the Nectar Light tradition. Mother and daughter were both Dakinis. Then Marpa journeyed to Nepal and at Ramadoli Ceme~ tery joined certain yogins performing a ganachakra feast. They said, \"We must hurry and finish this offering, since the Dakin is will come.\" Marpa felt disgust at their fear and thought, \"How grateful I am that I have met such a teacher as N aropa; I must return to India.\" At dawn Marpa slept briefly and had a dream in which a lady appeared before him wearing leaves. Placing her right hand on Marpa's head, she said, \"Do not return to India, but continue on to Tibet. There, there are many proper vessels waiting. You will encounter no further obstacles on your way.\" Thus she prophesied and gave him the blessing. In Nepal, in the Rinchen T siil temple, Marpa received the practice of Nectar Light and the direct realization of Ralchikma from Lama Paindapa. At this time he had a dream in which he saw Lord Maitripa riding a lion in the sky. He created a song about this and sang it to Paindapa. Further along, Marpa came to Lishokara, where he had a dream in which he saw two female Brahmins wearing the sacred thread, holding flowers, and reciting the Vedas. They said, \"Go to the South, to Shri Parvata, and obtain teach~ ings from the Great Brahmin [Saraha].\" Marpa said, \"I"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"MARPA cannot get there,\" and they said, \"Brother, have no fear. We will get you there easily.\" So saying, they placed him on a sedan chair and flew him through the sky to Shri Parvata. In the forest of the laksha tree, he found Saraha naked and covered with ashes, his hair knotted at the top of his head, a consort at each side. From him Marpa received the Mahamudra teachings. Later, he sang of this experience to Marpa Golek. While all this was happening, Marpa Golek, who had pure devotion to the Lama, thought: \"My Lama has still not returned to Tibet. Has he passed away in India or is he coming here? If he is coming, I should go forth to welcome him. So he set out and met Marpa at Kongphu. Marpa gave this disciple a ruby rosary of one hundred eight beads which had belonged to Naropa, and a vajra and bell which had belonged to Lord Maitripa. He also gave him the song of the Six Dharma Vajra Heart Teaching and others. At Nyagro, at a place called Kong Karpo, he met the wealthy grandfather of Marpa Golek, who had founded a school of philosophy there. At the request of many dis, ciples, he sang a song generally about his meetings with lamas in India and their different teachings, and particu, larly about his meeting with Naropa and the teachings he received from him. Then he went to Lhotrak in the South where he lived the life of a hidden yogin. Ngok Shungpa, Metsonpo, T sur Wangne and others gathered there and received many teach, ings. One day at Lho Layak, Marpa Tonse established a college and invited Marpa to come. On the way, he saw a farmer plowing a field. Marpa said, \"Look here and see whether I have practiced bodhicitta or not.\" When he picked up a stone many ants crawled out, and when he cupped his hand they all crawled onto his palms. F.

Generally, Marpa demonstrated the Trong,jug Phowa seven times in Tibet and once at Bodh'gaya in India. Once, a group of farmers set out with a yak to cut grass in the upper part of the valley. The yak died and Marpa said, \"While I take a walk, cut the grass and make it into a bundle. The yak will soon stand up. When he does, place the bundle on his back.\" Soon the yak arose and the farmers loaded him with the grass. When they returned home, the yak again fell down dead, and the Lama returned.

Once, when it was a young monk's turn, he stood near a pillar in order to protect the shrine from birds. When a pigeon came in, the monk threw a stone at him with such force that the bird died. So great was the monk's distress that Marpa came forward and asked him, \"Is the pigeon dead?\" When the monk replied that he was, Marpa said, \"I will show you something.\" Slowly he fell over and the pigeon flew up into the sky. After some time, Marpa's consciousness returned to his body, and he said wearily, \"In so inauspicious a body, it was difficult to detach my consciousness.\" In the bird form of the illusory body, Having the wings of unified experience, Exercise the skillful bird of the mind And meet the son and mother of bird and chicken.

It was Ngok Zhungpa who established the lineage of the explanation and study of the teaching of the Tantra. While studying the Tantra of the Nyingma lineage from the spirit-ual master Gyerlungpa, he heard of the fame of Lord Marpa and went to him, offering a yellow horse and requesting the teachings. Later, he made three large offerings, the first being a one hundred eight volume set of the Sutras including three Prajnaparamita. texts, the second being one hundred eight different kinds of valuable offerings, and the third being all his domestic animals, including seventy dri plus nomad tents, houses and even his dog. Still, Marpa refused to give him the complete profound teachings. Meanwhile, Marpa was suffering from bloody dysentery which he had contracted in India because of the extreme heat.

I. HIS MEETING WITH LORD MARPA The great saint lived in Gungthang in the Land of Snow, not far from Kyirong where rests a statue of the noble, great compassionate self,appearance (Chenrezig). He was of the clan of Khyungpo Mila: his grandfather was known as Mila Dorje Gyalpo, and his father as Mila Sherab Gyaltsen. His father married Nyangsama Karlek, and from this union there came forth three children: a girl, Peta; Tebchung; and Mila who at birth was named Mila Thopaga. Though the family enjoyed wealth and a good life, the father said: \"Our lives are worthless if we have no Dharma.\" So when Mila was growing up, he was sent to the spiritual master T sangpa from whom he received beginning instruc, tion in the Dharma. Later on, he loaded his horse with six bundles and journeyed to central Tibet. From Lhaje Yeshe"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"JETSUN MILAREPA 125 Sung in Rukhulung he received the complete teachings of Yamantaka and the magical powers of the protector Sadong Mamak. These he practiced for eight years, achieving the signs. Then he went to Nyangto Khore and received the teachings of Gyutrul from Bami Bhode Ratsa. In Nyangto Gyankhar he received the Maha Ati teaching from Gyerton Wangne, and in Yuphug in Rong he received further Maha Ati teaching from Dreton Wangne. Then he set out for Yardrok Dor and from Marpa Jungne received teachings on the nature of mind according to the Sutras. Once Marpa Jungne said, \"Gungthangpa [Milarepa], you and I have no worth. You are merely listening and I am merely speaking. These teachings of Dzogchen, Gyutrul and others give a general idea of the view, but to experience the realizations is difficult. In Lhotrak resides a great master, Lord Marpa, a principal disciple of Naropa who endured many hardships for the teachings. Lord Marpa has the path of the blessing Tantra and the technique of auspicious inter-dependence. Should we not, father and son, proceed there?\" These words awakened the connection which had existed between Marpa and Milarepa in previous lives, and by merely hearing them the great saint felt extraordinary devotion arise. Tears came to his eyes and the hairs of his body stood on end. He said, \"Let us proceed.\" So the master went forth with the disciple, but on the way Marpajungne became ill. \"I can go no further,\" he said, \"but you must continue.\" So the saint went on, experiencing hardships and hunger on the plain ofYardrok. He proceeded on his journey and approached Lhotrak. II. AFTER MEETING WITH MARPA HE RECEIVES THE TEACHINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS Mila continued without stopping and finally encountered Marpa in Khyenlung Monastery. He offered him sugar cane packed in goat skin and a piece of woolen cloth, saying, \"I am from Gungthang and have no possessions. I am here"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"126 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS because I fear the cycle of birth and death. Please accept me and grant me the teachings and necessities of life.\" The Lama replied, \"I can do one or the other, but not both.\" Mila was satisfied and was allowed to enter the Lama's household. Thereafter he performed every kind of service for the Lama, including building, and even offered him his body. Thus he received the teachings. At this time Ngok Zhungpa, Me Tshonpo, Tshur Wangne and others were also coming to receive teachings. Mila met them on the way to help them carry their many offerings, and with them he received Marpa's teachings and commen, taries on the Tantras. His own offering consisted of a large covered jar and a fine woolen cloth. The Lama returned the cloth to him, saying, \"Since you have no cloth, use this.\" But he accepted the jar, saying, \"We must interpret the symbolism of this offering: first, it is precious and red in color, meaning that you will benefit from the Dharma and will have many spontaneous realizations; second, the jar has a stain on the outside, meaning that you will experience certain obstacles and endure hardship; third, the inside is empty, meaning that you will have difficulty finding a means of livelihood while you practice meditation.\" Later, all these predictions proved to be true. Once there was a shortage of food due to an unusually hot summer and a modest harvest. So the Great Saint, Milarepa, went to sing in the city of Chukhyer for a crowd who remarked on the beauty of his song. For his skill he received a great quantity of barley which he offered to his teacher's wife. So pleased was she that she said to Marpa, \"Although great offerings have been made to the Lama by the disciples Ngok Zhungpa, Me Tshonpo and Tshur Wangne, the offer, ing of Great Magician (Milarepa) is the most meaningful. If there are teachings you lack, very well. But give him what, ever teachings you possess.\" Still, the Lama was careful at this time to transmit only certain teachings. As time went by, Great Magician grew strong from carry, ing stones, including some so large that they became known"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"JETSON MILAREPA I 2 7 as the Giant Stones of Milarepa, since only he could lift them. For each stone Milarepa carried, Marpa gave him one teaching. One day Ngok Zhungpa said, \"Since you are staying here, Great Magician, you have no need to hurry, but we have to return to our homes. So we would like to get the teachings before you.\" Milarepa replied, \"You are hurrying to your homes, but I am also in a hurry-to achieve enlight, enment. Look at my back.\" Then he showed them how it was covered with blisters from carrying so many heavy stones. The Great Saint then made a request to Marpa, saying, \"I must practice meditation so please give me the essence of all the teachings in order that I may practice.\" So Marpa gave him the abbreviated form of the Six Dharmas ofNaropa, the essence of the four Tantras. One night Lama Marpa walked about his community to observe each of his disciples and determine if they were practicing. Ngok Zhungpa was staring into a lamp and writing; Me Tshonpo was practicing meditation, and Tshur Wangne was meditating and looking at a small text which he had placed on his pillow. But when Marpa came to the place of the Great Saint, he saw that he had taken off his clothes and was in profound meditation with sweat pouring off his body. He therefore said, \"Ngok Zhungpa will become a Master of the giving of teachings and explanations; Me T shonpo will become a realized practitioner, and Tshur Wangne will become a meditation master. But Great Magician should not be asked to do physical work, for he will truly work hard to realize the whole of the meditation.\" In all, Mila attended Lord Marpa for six years, eleven months, and was given all the teachings without exception. He thought: \"I have received very profound teachings, yet I have not performed any service; indeed, I have taken the necessities of food and clothing from the Lama. On the other hand, Ngok Zhungpa and others offered the Lama all their wealth, so they must have received higher teachings than I. I must therefore go to them and obtain these teachings.\" Lord"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"128 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Marpa read into his mind, so when Ngok Zhungpa was taking his leave, Marpa placed his vajra on the crown of his head and said, \"Whatever teachings I have given you without exception should be given to Great Magician.\" Marpa then told Mila, \"Ngok Zhungpa is a great being and is also a mature Dharma friend, so you must obtain teachings from him.\" So Great Saint went to Ngok Zhungpa, but while with him he saw robbers from Dol stealing Ngok Zhungpa's horses, sheep and other domestic animals. With his powers he cast hail stones from his fingers, causing the robbers to approach him humbly with offerings of chang, Prajnaparamita texts and many other precious objects. Ngok Zhungpa gave Great Saint all the teachings without exception. Though he found a deeper meaning to the essence teachings, Ngok Zhungpa's long explanations were harder to understand than Marpa's more concise ones. As a result, Mila felt extraordinary devotion and deep confidence in Marpa. He thought, \"In general Marpa expected offerings, yet in particular he accepted me, transmitting all the pro, found teachings without asking for service or precious gifts. I should perhaps go to Gungthang and gather some sugar cane for an offering, but Marpa has already received many pre, cious objects, so my offering would appear as nothing. The supreme offering is the offering of practice. Therefore, to repay his kindness I should make an offering of my practice of the teachings he taught.\" III. MILAREPA'S MASTERY OF THE ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY ATTAINMENTS Below the monastery of Ngok lies a cave known as the Cave of Mila. There Milarepa practiced meditation for one year without leaving his seat, while Lama Ngok Zhungpa supplied his food and other needs. After one year Milarepa experienced some blissful heat and calm abiding. He thought: \"How long can I remain in the calm abiding state?\" To test himself he made a butter lamp, placed it on his head, and meditated. In the morning when he arose from his samadhi,"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"JETSON MILAREPA I 29 he had the impression of seeing a clear sky before him. He thought: \"I am experiencing a special quality of meditation which I have not known before.\" Then he remembered: \"The clear light appearance is not the sky, but the light of the lamp which I had forgotten upon my head!\" One night in a dream a lady appeared before him saying: \"The blessings and attainments you have received are few. There are still obstacles before you. Go to the South near Nepal. There you will receive the blessings of the Dakinis, and will draw closer to the realization of the meditation.\" Then she lifted him up in a white cloth. Great Saint took the text given him by Marpa and journeyed to his own birth, place. His father had passed away long before. He met his mother and sister, and offered his house and all his properties to his first spiritual master. From there he went to Katse cave and meditated for four months. Then he went to Tsenyang cave and after meditating for some days, experienced the inner heat. He remained there three months while great inner heat and other qualities arose in him. Then he medi, tated in the Black Cliff cave. One day while he was out walking, Mila noted that all the foliage in the farms below had grown yellow, as it was harvest time. Descending to the village to join the harvest celebra, tion, he heard one of the crowd remark, \"It is said that Mila Thopaga, who was long a wanderer, now wears only a cotton cloth and is a good religious person. Is that true?\" Another recounted, \"It is said that Mila has meditated for four months together without any food and clothing, and has now achieved the realizations.\" Another said, \"How marvelous! If we tried to see him, would we find him?\" Another said, \"He is here right now.\" As everyone held a different view, a dispute began which displeased Mila, but since the people were unsteady from drinking chang, he was able to make his escape back to the mountain. Thereafter, Milarepa went to three caves on the White Cliff Rock to practice meditation. He then went to the rocky cave ofLingwa where a hostile demoness came to tempt him."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"130 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Later, Mila said, \"There is no more danger at Lingwa Cave.\" At that time Mila was eating nettles without salt or other seasoning so Gurib Lhabar of Rakma, hearing of Milarepa's fame, promised to supply him with the necessities. That winter he invited Mila to the Rakma region to meditate at Kyang Pal. From there Mila meditated at Jangchub Dzong, at the Sky Fortress Horse Tooth Cave of Naphu. It was here that he sang the Song of the Floating Southern Cloud. Then he went to the forest of Singha. In Nepal a band of robbers stole from a band of yogins who said, \"We are yogins; please do not steal from us.\" The robbers replied, \"You are not yogins; the real yogi is in the forest. He is resistant to arrows.\" Later, Mila said, \"The robbers of Nepal shot arrows at me, but they bounced right off.\" Mila meditated in Nepal for four months, eating only fruit. At this time he sang the following song: Wondrous is the contented and solitary priest. Like the apes and monkeys who develop their agility, I, Milarepa, am practicing the art of meditation ... Afterward, Mila went to a cemetery ofSuturi and performed a ganachakra feast with Dakinis in attendance. Later, when he was meditating in the solitary place of Gungthang, he saw a girl across the river tending sheep with her friends. They asked her, \"What manner of man is this whom you have seen?\" She replied, \"He is a naked man.\" Mila thought, \"I should go to them.\" But at that moment they disappeared and he thought: \"Those are Dakinis.\" Then Mila meditated in the Solitary Cuckoo Place. Gurib Dharma Tsa invited him to Naphu where he stayed for a time. An Indian lady wearing a golden earring prostrated before him and promised to provide his food for a month. Mila asked, \"Where do you come from?\" And she replied, \"I come from the Pigeon Cave,\" and with that she flew away. In the morning Mila went to the cave and there saw a giant pigeon who circumambulated him seven times and did prostrations."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"JETSON MILAREPA 131 She then brought out forty jars of rice. Mila asked, \"Are you bringing this for me?\" The pigeon nodded its head. Mila remained there, meditating through the patronage of the pigeon. Then he meditated at the Tsikrna Cave ofT sum. In the summer he stayed in the three caves of the White Cliff and in winter he went to Mang-Yul Rock and other places. At the White Place Pass there dwelt a yogin called Sarnten, whose retinue began criticizing Milarepa for his unconventional behavior and lack of Dharma knowledge. One day they approached him directly and said, \"Since you are a good singer singer, please sing us a song.\" Thus he sang the following song: Like a snow lion cub, I have perfected nimbleness in my mother's womb. I have journeyed a long distance to the Southern Cliffl And met the Lord of the realized lineage. Hearken once more to the teachings of the Hearing Lineage, And practice the teachings in various solitary mountains. Why not be overcome by sarnadhi? Hearing this, the yogi developed deep devotion for Mila. Once Mila went to Sodugyenre in Ronphu. Some monks carne to him, saying disrespectfully, \"Yogin, you have no need of food or clothing. Please be an object of offering for us.\" So saying, they put him in a shrine and locked the door. But when they went outside, they saw Milarepa, and when they returned to the shrine, he was there as well. Seeing this, they recognized that he was a siddha and they developed deep devotion. Mila also went to Nyanarn and Mang-Yul Gungthang, becoming free of the need to travel in a physical form, and lwhere Marpa resided"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"132 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS prodigal in his virtuous activities. Once, when he was staying at Zawog Cave, he saw from afar the son of Lama Lodro who, though a small boy, was tending donkeys. When Mila sang a song, the child heard him and immediately went into medi~ tation. All the donkeys returned to their huts. The next day, Nyenchung Dorje Drak came to see the child at his home and asked, \"Where did you go yesterday?\" The child replied, \"I heard a very beautiful sound which caused me to lose consciousness.\" The next day the child returned early with his donkeys to the place where Mila was staying. The Lama asked the child, \"What kind of dream did you have last night?\" He replied, \"I dreamed that I went to the southeastern side of a meadow. A group of young women took a garland of flowers from a bowl and placed it around my neck.\" Mila said, \"Will you follow me?\" The boy agreed. Thus, the Lama accepted him as a disciple. When the child returned home, he said, \"I can no longer look after donkeys. You must find someone else to take my place.\" The villagers said, \"You were appointed to care for our donkeys because you are one of our own people.\" And his brother told him, \"Do not tell us you are leaving. It is harvest time now. We need you. Return to your duties with the donkeys.\" However the boy returned to Mila's side and refused to go home. When they went to Palthan Plain, Mila carried him on his back because the walk was too arduous for the young child. They stayed at the Phugtak Cave and went to Doram Yangram where Mila gave the Tummo teaching, achieving the psychic heat yoga. Thereafter, he wore only a cotton cloth. The young boy stayed at Chogkar Cave, and everyone was amazed by the Elder and Younger Cotton Cloths, as they were known. While there, Mila gave Mahayana yoga and other teachings and everyone developed deep devotion. One lady patron thought, \"Although this Great Saint knows all the teachings, his post~meditation practice of body and speech are merely torma offerings.\" And she was disap~ pointed in him. But one day when she went to Milarepa's room with the idea of doing prostrations, she found a blazing"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"JETSON MILAREPA I 33 fire on the couch where the master normally sat. Addressing Shengong Repa, she asked, \"Where is Mila?\" He replied, \"I don't think he has gone anywhere. Let us go together and see.\" When they went in, they found the Lama in his accustomed place on the couch. \"Where have you been?\" they asked. \"I have been nowhere,\" he replied. So the woman developed deep confidence in the Lama and deter-mined to ask his pardon for harboring doubts. But the next morning they found that the Lama had disappeared without a trace. One day Mila went to Tshonga Drechu where many disci-ples came to pay their respects. Among them, five young women wearing festive clothes and ornaments sang a song called \"The White Mountain Tise [Mt. Kailash]\" to test him. At the end, one of the women developed deep devo-tion, and offering Mila her clothing and turquoise headdress, requested the teachings. From him she received the Tummo practice, and within three days achieved the psychic heat realization. Later, Rechungpa gave the woman further teach-ings. In Chaksedo at Nam Tsho Chukmo she practiced meditation in silence for eight years. Later she went directly to a heaven realm. From Tshonga Drechu Mila and his young disciple went to Chimlung Khurbu where they saw Ngandzong Jangchub plowing the field. They said to him, \"We two yogins ask that you give us something to eat.\" He replied, \"If you are true yogins, you are used to singing a song inspired by whatever appears around you. So please, sing a song inspired by my plowing the field.\" Mila then sang a song about farming. Seeing that Mila carried a cane walking stick, the man asked Mila to sing a song about the stick. When Mila sang about his white cane stick, Ngandzong Repa became his disciple. Once a man came to fetch Rechungpa with a message from King T sede. Together, he and Mila went to Lo, where they gave teachings that inspired all with profound faith. Before Mila went away, everyone bid him farewell and requested a song. He sang:"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"134 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS I am a person, I am one, I am the yogi, I am the repa yogin of Tibet ... Once, Mila said to Likhor Charuwa, who had asked permission to go see his mother, \"When you set out, do not delay. Go directly.\" But in Chebu Likhor was asked to read scriptures for a man who had died. Because of this delay, he found on arriving at his old home that his mother had died several days before. Thus he realized that if he had obeyed the Lama, he could have seen his mother while she was yet alive. Thereafter he developed profound faith in Milarepa. Great Saint went to Tsarma in Nyanam where there lived a lady known as Ngak Dormo who worked in the fields. Also, working there were Ghomma Shene and his father. The three started talking among themselves and one of the men said, \"Nowadays, who is the greatest master alive?\" The other man replied, \"Perhaps it is Sangkar Lotsawa.\" And the first man said, \"I believe it is Jomo Shama ofNyanam.\" But Ngak Dormo said, \"Nowadays in our country Mila is the most famous.\" Just as she said this, a yogin wearing a cotton cloth appeared, saying, \"I understand a person named Ngak Dormo lives here. Where is she?\" In this way Ngak Dormo met him and invited him to her home, honoring him highly. That evening before Mila retired, Ngak Dormo prepared a comfortable bed with wool coverings. Mila said, \"I have no need of these,\" but she insisted. While Mila stayed there, Ngak provided for all his needs. At a place a short distance away called Kharna, Mila also meditated for a time. In the Nyanam area a female saint and her daughter provided for his needs. Meanwhile, Ngak Dormo offered Milarepa twelve pints of tsampa, a whole carcass of dried meat, and a ball of butter. Thus he had all that he needed. Later, Mila decided to go to Lachi Snow Mountain. On the way snow fell for nine days and nine nights. All the people"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"JETSON MILAREPA 135 were distressed and two elderly people wept unceasingly. Everyone made special prayers at various intervals, thinking that Mila had died in the snow. Later, Driban Tashi, Gomchen Tshedrak, Kyaba Khamsum, Kyiton Shakwang, Nying Khung Yara and the patron Dormo went in search of the Lama. They suffered frostbite and when they arrived at Dukmo, all they saw was a giant snow leopard stretching on the ground. They thought: \"The Lama's body has been eaten by the snow leopard.\" Then they saw the footprints of the snow leopard turning into the footprints of a man. \"This is impossible,\" they said. But when they followed the foot-prints, they heard the Lama singing. Entering the cave, they found Mila finishing his meal. Four pints of tsampa, a por-tion of the dried meat, and a third of the butter remained. Everyone strongly requested that Mila visit the town. The villagers, believing that the Lama had died in the snow, came to see with their own eyes if it were truly he. When they saw him, they were overwhelmed and made prostra-tions. Then Mila sang a song of the Lachi Mountain, and word of his fame spread throughout the country like the light of the sun and the moon. Arriving at Lachi on the evening of the fourteenth day of the middle summer month, Mila witnessed many obstacles arising, including a battle between gods and demons. But he sang a song and all those hearing it became subdued and developed profound devotion. Even the hardest to tame, Mutek Thangtrin, supplied Mila's needs for a month. Later, Milarepa resided on the left side of Lachi Moun-tain, attended by Dampa Gyak Chung. Milarepa gave him teachings and meditated under a tree, saying, \"You will not have time to meditate here when you are older.\" He also said, \"Do not build a temple or make offerings to demons, and do not destroy ants' nests in the countryside.\" At the time, Dampa did not understand the meaning of Mila's words but later, events came to pass exactly as Mila predicted. When Dampa returned from twenty years of study in Central Tibet, he tried to build a temple at Nashuk, but because of a"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS lack of wood he had to cut down trees from the right side of Lachi Mountain. He also had to ask guidance because of jealous rock spirits, and was forced to scatter ants' nests when he laid the temple's foundations. Then he realized that Mila had foretold the future. Once, while Mila was meditating in Western Tibet, an important person of the region died, and the people all around performed ritual prayers on his behalf. When they learned that Mila was nearby, they invited him to come to their village so that the people could receive blessings and make offerings. The head of the house in which the man had died made an offering of a fine horse, but Mila said, \"Take your offerings back.\" Then Mila went to Rangso Thang where he was highly honored. When he left that place, Drangton Phagpa, Geshe Ngadungwa and Jo Se Chopa sought him out and invited him to the city where they honored him. As the Lama prepared to leave that place, the men refused to let him go. But when Mila promised to return later, they allowed him to leave. At his next meditation place the wind energy travelled up Mila's body and through his crown chakra. He stopped breathing, meditated, and experienced bliss. At midnight many women appeared before him, folded their hands and said, \"Be mindful.\" With that the Lama brought his mind back to the earthly plane and meditated, allowing the wind energy to return to its normal place. At the moment of the sun's setting, the energy again rose up and through the crown chakra, causing him to stop breathing, but he meditated as before and his energy returned to his body. He thought: \"The fact that my wind energy has returned to its own place is due to the promise I made to the people that I would return.\" Then Mila went to Orin. A tantrika had a hidden consort who went to Mila, doing prostrations before him and offer-ing rice. Mila accepted the rice in a cotton cloth. Suddenly, a small turquoise appeared on the cloth which he placed in"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"JETSON MILAREPA I 3 7 front of the offering. \"Go to Bodetse,\" he said. Then he went to Nyashing Phug. When the people of Drin heard that he had gone to that place, the devotees Lekse and Tashi Tsek agreed to supply his needs. Before this, the devotee Chobar had asked Mila to accept his food offering. The Lama made this pronouncement: \"First, I must accept Tashi Tsek's food, then you can make your offering.\" Chobar went to Lekse and Tashi Tsek and said, \"You make your food offering to the Lama first, and then I will make mine.\" \"How did you know that we planned to make an offering?\" they asked. He replied, \"Mila told me.\" Thus, they realized that Mila pos-sessed supernatural insight. Mila was invited to Manlung where the people all made offerings on alternate days. When he stayed at Red Cliff Peak, he sang: High above, the southern cloud is floating. Below, the white vajra is floating . . . Once, when the Lama was sitting above the forest, two devotees came to look for him, but not seeing him they set off again. As they moved away, Mila called after them, asking, \"Where have you been?\" They replied, \"We went to see the Lama. Instead, we saw a stupa.\" Once, a devotee appeared in the Lama's presence and looked straight ahead without doing prostrations. Mila called out to him to draw near and asked, \"Why are you not doing prostrations?\" He answered, \"Because the Lama is not there.\" The Lama said, \"I was in the samadhi of space.\" Another person asked, \"What were you doing during that time?\" He replied, \"I have done nothing. People did not see Pandita Dipankara, either, when he was circumambulating the moun-tain peak, for he, too, was doing nothing. But because of interdependence, others received the impression of action. Therefore, the two form bodies of the Buddha appear accord-ing to others' mental attainments, but the Buddha actually did nothing.\" Once, Tashi Tsering of Drin, who had not been in the"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Lama's presence before, arrived in time to see the Lama falling off a cliff and arising without harm to himself. Every, one asked, \"How could you fall from such a high cliff and arise again without loss of life?\" Mila said, \"If someone else had done this, his body would have been broken in many pieces.\" Once Mila was seen floating in the sky in a crystal stupa. Another time, when he stayed at Rithong Tokli T se on the Drongkha Shi mountain of Nepal, a man of the place who felt contempt for the Lama came to see him. Addressing Mila, he said, \"The fame of the yogi Milarepa is baseless. The true spiritual friend is Bari Lotsawa. He possesses para, sols and trumpets, and gives heaps of gold to those who approach him.\" A few nights later, he saw three visions of the Lama riding on a lion in the sky. He and others seeing this vision developed profound devotion to Milarepa and honored him. The Lama's attendants said to the man, \"Previously you had no faith. Why are you honoring Mila now?\" The disciple replied, \"We are devoted to the Lama because we have three times seen him riding snow lions in the sky.\" Gampopa said that these events came to pass a year before he met Mila. Once, at a ceremonial gathering, a lady asked a disciple of Mila's to name certain of the Lama's qualities. He said, \"The Lama possesses the ability to see the future, as well as sama, dhi, freedom from concepts and other qualities.\" She replied disdainfully, \"You cannot describe your Lama's qualities.\" He said, \"If you know his qualities, please tell me.\" She went and brought forth a stupa and said, \"When I make supplica, tions each night Mila appears in this stupa three times and I make offerings.\" Thus it was clear that the lady was a Dakini. Once, when Mila and his devotees were going to Chak, dranglung in Drin there was a great snowfall and Mila flew overhead beyond his disciples' reach. Concerning nourish, ment, he said, \"All I need is four handfuls of rice each month.\" Gampopa agreed to provide this for him, but when there were no humans to serve him, the Dakinis offered him"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"JETSON MILAREPA I 39 various kinds of food and drink. Even so, he could go four, five and six days at a time without food. \"I never think about food,\" said he. \"When I enter into samadhi I have no need of it.\" One year, as the seventh month of the Tibetan calendar was drawing to a close, he was staying in solitude at Chuwar at Drok Menlung when a plague befell the people, killing many humans and animals. On the eleventh day of the following month, as the sun set, a young woman wearing pearl and turquoise ornaments and silken robes appeared, radiating light. In her hands were a pair of white silken cloths decorated in scarlet with designs resembling flames, surrounded by the five jewels. Touching her head to Mila's feet, she circumambulated him seven times and prostrated nine times, saying, \"Oh great)etsiin, our leader is gravely ill. Please come to that snow mountain.\" And she pointed in a far direction. Great Jetsiin replied, \"The day is now well advanced, so I can't leave. I will come when the sun rises.\" The woman said, \"A miraculous path of light will appear that will allow Jetsiin to proceed to the snow mountain without obstacles. Therefore, please come today.\" Great Jetsiin said, \"Let me see that path. I am an old man, but I have never heard of such a thing. In what direction does it lie? Point it out to me.\" The woman pulled a bolt of white wool from her body and threw it across the sky to make a bridge, saying, \"Please use this path.\" No sooner had Jetsiin set foot on the cloth than he arrived, like a flash of lightning, on the right side of the peak of the High Floating Queen of Snow Mountains [Gawishankar]. On that spot stood a white silk tent in which hung a piece of gold cotton cloth held up by a sapphire,like jewel. A standing shell served as the tent post, and the pegs were made of coral. On a couch lay a lady fine in every respect, her hair falling to her feet. Lifting her head and looking at Great Jetsiin from blood,shot eyes, she said, \"I am gravely ill; please heal me.\" Jetsiin asked, \"What has caused your sickness and when did it start? How serious is it?\" In this way he learned what had happened. \"My illness"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"140 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS was caused by unhealthful smoke that rose up when humans burned impure objects during these last summer months,\" she replied. \"It became especially severe from the twenty-sixth day of the eighth month.

I must make this being enter into a commitment. 11 Aloud he said, \"Beautiful lady, I previously gave you the Bodhisattva vow and the recitation mantra of the yidam. I have also given you the teachings on cause and effect. But you have not remained true to your samaya vows, for you have no patience even with a small sickness. You have caused much harm to many lives-even to beings who are blameless. Now, it is hard for me to trust you when I see what you have done. If you promise to stop bringing disease on other beings, I will see ifl can help you. But if you do not promise, I will immediately leave, and you will continue to experience suffering because of your broken vows. 11 The woman became fearful and clung to the feet of the Jetsiin, saying, \"It is the nature of us ignorant beings to commit errors, so please do not be angry with us. In general, the higher gods will not harm others if others do not harm them. In particular, I have not harmed anyone because of my vows to you, J etsiin.

This once, please show your compassion. 11 Mila said, \"Perform the purification of the hundred-syllable mantra, invoke the Tri-ple Gem repeatedly, and perform the Ushnishavijaya prac-tice to extend life. 11 Next day the woman was able to arise from her bed and do prostrations; after eight days she returned to a fully normal state, and her complexion became more"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"JETSON MILAREPA radiant than before.

What kind of prayers should they say?\" She replied, \"According to the samaya of the Loka Dakinis, if one among us is ill, all will fall ill. In addition, the gods and demons in samsara will also be affected. This is because of interdependent origination. In the same way, when I am well so are the others. But that they might return to health more quickly, they should recite the mantra of the essence of Tathagata's ushnisha, read the profound Mahayana sutras, and bathe in the vase water. They should also create a boundary around the city and make torma and tshok offerings mixed with butter, cheese and sugar, with adornments of other foods. This will stop the various sicknesses.\" Great Jetsiin returned to the White Cliff of Orin and told the people, \"I had a dream in which the leader of the Dakinis became displeased because of the smoke and steam from dirty cooking fires. For this reason, many gods and demons became angered. To pacify them, collect the materials to perform a tshok offering with many tormas. Invoke the Triple Gem, offer tormas to the Dharma protectors, share what you have assembled with the gods and demons of samsara, and pro-nounce the word of truth. In this way, the great plague will cease.\" On the twenty-ninth day of that month, Tashi Tseringma, along with five Dakinis of her retinue and other followers, approached Jetsiin with many kinds of magnificent foods and drink placed in vessels made of four kinds of precious jewels. They also did prostrations, circumambulated him many times and sang songs to repay his kindness. They also requested the profound teachings which Great Jetsiin offered in a song. Once, while Mila was at Orin, Darmatak, one of his disciples, became lost, causing his relatives to mourn him. When the Lama asked about the cause of their lament, they replied, \"Darmatak is surely dead.\" The Lama replied, \"He is"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"142 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS not dead., The relatives stopped crying and asked if the Lama could bring him back to them. Later, Darmatak reappeared, so proving that the Lama had perfect supernatu, ral insight. In this way he possessed limitless qualities. Milarepa was never separate from the samadhi state, expe, rienced no duality between meditation and post meditation, and achieved the absolute truth of Dharmata, the manifesta, tion of Dharmakaya. On the eighth day of the fourth month in the Year of the Bird Mila entered Mahasamadhi at the age of eighty,two. His cremation took place both in Tise and Orin. At that time he appeared in three different places; in one form he became the object of offerings of Tashi Tseringma, and in another he went to India. IV. THE RIPENING OF THE PROPER VESSELS In general, Great Saint had many disciples, among them four heart,sons, eight close disciples, six disciples who appeared just before he passed away, and one peerless son who holds the Lineage. The four heart,sons are: Nyenchung Repa of Gungthang; Seban Repa of Dohse; Mandzong Repa of Chimlung; and Drigom Repa of Tamo. The eight close disciples were Repa Shiwa Od; Repa Sangye Kyab; Repa Sang,yuwa; Repa Dorje Wang; Shengom Repa; Rongchung Repa; Kharchung Repa; and Langom Repa. The six disciples who appeared just before he passed away are: Nyamme Rinpoche; Likhor Charuwa; Wurton Gediin; Kyiton Shakgu; Dampa Gyakbuwa; and Drephen Trashi. Among them his only Dharma heir and foremost unparalleled heart,son, he who holds the lineage, is the Dharma Lord Gampopa Nyamme Rinpoche. The Lord Gampopa was prophesied by the Buddha in many of his teachings. Glorious Phagmodrupa also said: I prostrate to the precious Lama Who in an earlier time was Metok Dadze,"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"JETSON MILAREPA Who at the time of the Buddha appeared as Dawo Zhonnu, And who in this degenerate time is a great being. 143 The Sutras say, \"Earlier he achieved enlightenment in the name of Buddha Padma Lama; at the time of the Buddha he appeared as Dawo Zhonnu; in this time he came bearing the name of physician and had as disciples not less than seven hundred monks who all achieved the quality of samadhi, the complete realization of Dharmata.\" The Hidden Treasure Text by the King of Tibet, Songtsen Gampo, who was the emanation of Chenrezig, said: In the Land of Snow, In the degenerate time, The teaching of great compassion Will arise. At that time the image of the Buddha Will be no different than the Buddha himself, And the image of Chenrezig Will be no different from the true Chenrezig. All the teachers will honor them. Through the great meditator who is the essence of the teaching And a precious Bodhisattva There will appear many great beings Who possess limitless qualities. This great, unparalleled being (Gampopa) combined two streams of the teachings: that of Atisha, and that of Great Saint. The Dharma Lord Drikungpa said, \"This precious Kagyu lineage brings the two lines together: From Atisha come the precious true Bodhicitta, the pure moral disci~ pline, the assembly of teachings, the cultivation of the mind, the method of consecration, and others; from the teachings of Great Saint come the Mahamudra of the co~emergent wisdom, the Six Dharmas of Naropa and many others."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Atisha (982 .. 1055) One of the great ornaments of the world is the pandita Jowoje, an emanation of Buddha Maitreya.

I prostrate to him who causes the harvest of devoted sentient beings to ripen like the waxing moon.\" From the Revealed Hidden Treasure of the Dharma King Songtsen Gampo: \"There will come a bird~faced bhikshu hom in the north. His translator, the learned Bodhisattva Rinchen Sangpo, will honor this Buddha's image, circum~ ambulate him, show him many signs of respect, and serve him. At this time there will appear a King called Jangchub 6d, who will be a learned Bodhisattva. He will invite to Tibet a Bodhisattva pandita who has the quality of the three trainings and three vows, 1 and who is master of scholarship and meditation. He will make offerings and prostrations, and paying homage to the statue of Buddha Shakyamuni will cause the teachings to flourish.

She will cut all Dharma in the mind expanse and will perform the action free from conceptualization. She will be confused with Gyachamma, who will be influenced by the non,virtuous Pekar. At the time of Machik at Dengri Langkor in Lato there will appear an Indian, one of my supreme disciples, known as a glorious naked one. He will bring teachings from India called Pacifying the Suffering. At that time in central Tibet, a son of the virtuous King Dipankara (Atisha), who is the emanation of my speech, will cause Dharma to pervade throughout Tibet.\" Thus was prophesied the coming of the Lord of Beings, Atisha, whose life has three major aspects: I. possessing the teachings of the lineage lamas; II. mastering the five aspects of knowledge and the three trainings while keeping the three vows purely; and III. receiving the vision and teachings of the yidams while seeing the absolute truth of the Dharma, as,Such and causing the teachings of the Bud, dha to flourish. I. POSSESSING THE TEACHINGS OF THE LINEAGE LAMAS This section has three aspects: (A) the lineage of the pro, found action, (B) the lineage of the profound view, and (C) the lineage of the profound experience."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"ATISHA 147 A The Profound Action Lineage The teachings which Lord Maitreya gave to Asanga were in turn given by him to Vasubandhu in the following man~ ner: in general, the Abhidharma has been destroyed three times, first by the Tartar tribe, then by heretics, and finally by a beggar with the attainment of the sun's energy. This is how it came to pass: once, the Indian King sent a cloth to the King of the Tartars, at the center of which was a child's footprint. The King of the Tartars thought: \"In general, the people of the central country are expert in magic spells. This must be such a spell.\" Thus, he sent an army to destroy the Abhidharma teachings. Those who did not perish continued their practice. Among the heretics was an old lady possessing the knowl~ edge of the science of sound. She therefore understood the meaning of the sound made by the gong when it was beaten in the monasteries. Once, hearing such a gong, she said, \"We should learn something from that sound.\" By beating the gong of the Triple Gem The objects of offering of gods, nagas and yakshas Destroy the brain of the heretics. The people therefore felt that the gong was harmful to the heretics, and so sent soldiers to destroy the Abhidharma teachings. After this, those who did not perish continued to practice the teachings. Finally, two beggars came to a Buddhist monastery to demand food. When the monastery attendant threw water at them and chased them from the place, the beggars became intensely angry and agreed that one of them would dig a shallow ditch near a sunny place, while the other would search for food. After some time, the beggar bringing the food asked the one sitting in the ditch, \"Have you realized the achievement of the power of the sun?\" The other replied: \"I have not; perhaps I should cease my efforts.\" The first man rejoined, \"I have worked hard to provide you with food, even"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS during times of famine. If you are not going to realize the sun, I will kill you right where you are sitting.\" So for three years the beggar practiced realizing the sun, and in the end achieved his goal. The other beggar helped his friend out of the ditch, and together they pretended to be a blind man and his attendant. The two then went toward the monastery where they had begged unsuccessfully, and the meditator shot sparks of fire from his eyes which burned the entire building. When the fire was at last put out, some said the water had issued from a sacred text. When they later opened this text, it turned out to be the Guhyasamaja. Around this time a Brahmin lady named Salwai T sultrim, who was devoted to the Buddha's teaching, said, \"The Abhidharma, the light of all teachings, has declined. Sen, tient beings are now plunged into the obscuration of dark, ness, with no great pandita to cause the teachings to flourish. As I am but a woman, I stand no chance of seeing the noble ones. Therefore I must give birth to a child who will cause the teachings to flourish.\" From the woman's union with the King there came forth Asanga, and from her union with a Brahmin came Vasubandhu. In order to foster the intelli, gence of both children, she made them sleep under a shade tree, fed them three kinds of milk products, and annointed their tongues with sandalwood paste. She also taught Asanga to recite the mantra of Trinyensale, and Vasubandhu the mantra of Machachenmo, telling both to meditate on the yidam deities. When the two young men had grown up, they asked their mother which of them should maintain the family home. She replied, \"You are not born to maintain a house. The Abhidharma has been destroyed three times and the teachings have declined. You are born to cause the teachings to flourish, so direct your efforts toward this end.\" Thus, Vasubandhu went to Western India, met the master Sanghabadra, studied the Low Vehicle Abhidharma, and became a great master in the study of the Sutras, while Asanga went to Southern India and meditated for three years in the Asura cave known as Bird Feet. When no signs of the"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"ATISHA 149 practice appeared, he determined to abandon the cave. However, seeing drops of water falling from one rock to another and creating a depression thereon, he thought, \"There is nothing gentler than water and nothing harder than rock. Yet with time water can wear away rock. I have put but little time into the practice of the Noble One, so I shall return to the cave for another three years.\" Nonethe~ less, he did not attain the signs. But on coming out again, he saw a pigeon's nest lodged in a rock and thought, \"Because the pigeon comes out in the morning and returns in the evening, the rock has become smooth. Now there is nothing softer than a bird's feather and nothing harder than rock, but with time even a feather can wear rock away. Perhaps if I spend more time, I can realize the Noble One. So I shall return to the cave for another three years.\" Still, he did not attain the signs, so he came out again and this time saw an old man whittling down an iron slab by rubbing it with a pigeon feather and sand. Asanga asked him: \"Why are you doing this?\" and the man replied, \"I am turning this iron into a sharp needle.\" Asanga asked, \"Is it possible?\" and the man replied, \"With time it is indeed possible.\" Asanga thought, \"There is nothing softer than a bird's feather and sand, and there is nothing harder than iron. But if it is possible by taking time to create a needle thus, then I must put more time into the practice of the Noble One. Therefore I shall return to the cave for another three years.\" Never~ theless, he still did not attain the signs. So he came out again and in the valley below saw a dog whose body was covered with maggots. When he saw this, Asanga felt strong compas~ sion, and went to a city called Atsinda to pawn his mendi~ cant's staff and begging bowl in exchange for a sharp blade. With this he cut a piece of flesh from his own body in order to attract to it all the maggots from the dog's body. Then he took the dog on his lap, closed his eyes and licked the maggots off. The dog disappeared and Buddha Maitreya appeared in his place, surrounded by a rainbow halo. Asanga said, \"You don't have much compassion for me, for it took"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS you so long to appear.\" Buddha Maitreya replied, \"I was there from the beginning, but you didn't see me because of your obscurations. I was in the drops of water and all the other manifestations that you saw. If you doubt me, hoist me onto your shoulder and show me to the people of the town.\" Asanga hoisted Maitreya onto his shoulder, went to the town and told the people, \"Maitreya is here, so do prostra~ tions.\" They replied, \"What is that monk saying? No one is with him.\" But a lady meditator of pure karma saw a white dog on Asanga's shoulder. In the samadhi of Dharma conti~ nuity Asanga saw the emanation body of Buddha Maitreya and received the teaching called \"The Clarification of the Center and Boundary.\" Then he saw the sambhogakaya form of Buddha Maitreya and received the Sutra Alankara and other Mahayana teachings. Within three years he recorded these five teachings1 in a text and also wrote the Teachings of Yoga Charya. Asanga saw that Vasubandhu had mastered the Low Vehi-cle and was abusing the Mahayana teachings. Vasubandhu said, \"Alas, Asanga has meditated for twelve years in the forest, yet he has not achieved samadhi. Now all he does is write elephant-loads of texts.\" To alter Vasubandhu's wrong view, Asanga sent two ofhis highly realized disciples towards him, instructing them, \"One of you recite the Dasha Bhumi Sutra at dusk, and the other recite the Lodro Misiipa Sutra at dawn. If Vasubandhu has a sharp knife, hide it. And if he wants to cut his tongue out, tell him, 'Do not cut your tongue. Your brother has a method for purifying your obscurations, so go to him.' Then bring him here.\" Thus, the two went to Vasubandhu, and while his disci~ pies were asleep, Asanga's disciples recited the sutras. When Vasubandhu heard the Dasha Bhumi Sutra, he thought, \"The Mahayana teaching is good cause and good result. I see I have been abusing this teaching; this is a fault of my tongue, I Center and Boundary; The Clarifying of the Dharma Expanse; the Clarification of the Sutra Alankara; Abisama,a Alankara; Uttaratantra"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"ATISHA 151 so I should cut it out.\" And he went to look for a knife, but could find none. Asanga's disciples then did as he instructed and brought him to their teacher. While Vasubandhu was listening to the teachings, he asked many penetrating questions, for his co,emergent wis, dom was sharper than Asanga's. Asanga then went into pro, found meditation, and with his body of mental emanation went to the Tushita Heaven to see Maitreya and clarify Vasubandhu's questions. He also received there many other Mahayana teachings, all of which took some time. Growing impatient, Vasubandhu pushed Asanga, saying, \"Answer my questions.\" Asanga's body fell over, whereupon Vasubandhu became frightened. At once, consciousness returned to Asanga and he said, \"I will give you the answers.\" Vasubandhu interjected, \"Before you do, tell me why you just now appeared as one dead?\" Asanga replied, \"For five hundred successive lifetimes you have been a pandita, so you have great co,emergent wisdom and limitless confidence. I have less wisdom, so I must depend on good yidam deities. I therefore went to them to seek the answers. At the same time, I received many other Mahayana teachings and this took some time.\" Vasubandhu said, \"Please show me your yidam deity.\" But Asanga replied, \"This would cause my samaya to decline, so I cannot do it.\" Vasubandhu said, \"Then please lead me to Maitreya.\" Asanga said, \"Catch hold of my cloth and I will take you to Tushita.\" There, Asanga abided in samadhi, achieving perfect communion with Maitreya. But Vasubandhu could not see Maitreya; instead, he only saw Asanga as a hollow body filled with light. When Asanga awoke from samadhi, he asked Vasubandhu if he had seen Maitreya and been inspired by the Mahayana teaching. Vasubandhu replied, \"Even you I saw as a hollow body of light, so how could I see Maitreya or hear the teachings?\" Asanga said, \"So you did not have the fortune enough to see Maitreya. Let us go back.\" Vasubandhu insisted that Asanga tell Maitreya of his wish to see him. When Asanga did so, Maitreya said, \"Because he is an ordinary person and has"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS abused the Mahayana teachings, he cannot see me in this lifetime. He must make aspiration prayers to see me in the next life. In addition, to purify his obscurations of speech, he should write the Eight Prakaranas, develop devotion to the Mahayana teachings, and write commentaries on them. As you, Asanga, are realized in the Abhidharma, you should write a commentary on two of my texts for the benefit of all beings in general, and for the benefit of Vasubandhu in particular.\" At this moment Asanga showed Vasubandhu his face and gave him the teachings on the five texts of Maitreya. The teachings were thus given through Maitreya as master, Asanga as translator, and Vasubandhu as suppli-cant. Vasubandhu was greatly pleased and praised his elder brother thus: My elder brother is like a Naga, And I like a fish desiring rain. Though the N agas cause rain in the sky, It is rare for it to fall in the fish's mouth. Asanga was prophesied by the Buddha. It is said in the Manjushrimula Tantra text: A bhikshu called Asanga Who sees the meaning of the texts, Reveals the various ultimate meanings of the Sutras, And is master of virtuous action, Will become a noble commentator. By the power of the T antras His wisdom will increase: He will see the meaning of suchness, Compile the Sutras, Cause the teachings to be maintained for a long time to come, Live one hundred fifty years, Be reborn in higher realms after leaving the body, Experience lasting peace,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"ATISHA Remain in samsara for a long time, And ultimately achieve enlightenment. 153 Asanga gave teachings to Vasubandhu, who gave them to Arya Namdrolde, who gave them to the commoner Namdrol De, who gave them to Chok,gi De, who gave them to Dulwai De, who gave them to Khenpo Yangdak Namnangze, who gave them to Seng,ha Badra, who gave them to Rinchen Zangpo, who gave them to Rata Prajnapala, who gave them to Gunamaitra, who gave them to Atisha. B. The Profound View Uneage The coming of the Lord of Sentient Beings, Arya Nagar, juna, is prophesied in many Sutras and Tantras. In the Mahamega Sutra the Buddha said, \"Ananda, four hundred years after I have passed away, Lichavi Zhonnu Semchen Thamchekyi Thonga Gawa will appear as a bhikshu called Naga, who will cause my teachings to flourish greatly. Finally, Tathagata Jnanakara Prabhava will appear in a world called Rabtudangpai Od.\" And in the same Sutra it is said, \"In this fortunate world there will appear one thousand Buddhas. Thereafter, for sixty,two kalpas there will appear no Bud,â¢ dha, but one hundred thousand million Pratyeka Buddhas. Later, seven Buddhas will arise. Yet later, this world will be called Ngonpar Dangwa (Fully Clear) and in it a Buddha called Jnanakara will appear.\" And in the Ngawoche (Great Drum) Sutra it is stated: 0 All,Seeing Happy World Teacher Manifested in the form of a monk, Maintain the teachings for a long period And beat the great drum of the teachings. In the same text it says: After passing away He will be reborn in the world called Dewachen. At that time by miraculous powers"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"154 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS He will manifest in many forms. One emanation body will remain In Dewachen at the eighth Bodhisattva level, And one will go to Tushita And will proclaim this Sutra from Maitreya. And in the Manjushrimula Tantra it is written, \"After entering Parinirvana I, Tathagata, will appear after four hundred years as a bhikshu called Nagarjuna, who will benefit from this teaching, achieve the joyous level of a Bodhisattva, and live for six hundred years. This great Lord will practice the Knowledge of Macha, will write many commentaries, will realize the suchness of the non,observation meaning, will go to Dewachen after leaving that body, and will definitely achieve Enlightenment after that time.\" The Lankavatara Sutra states, \"In the future, who will hold this tradition? Listen, Great Wise One, in the Bheta country in the South a Bhikshu named Pal den, who will be called N aga, will cause the division between nihilists and eternalists to disappear. This ultimate great vehicle will flourish throughout the world, will achieve the joyous bhumi state, and will go to Dewachen.\" Thus was this great being prophesied. Nagarjuna was born a Brahmin in the city known as Great Rosary, near another city known as Resistance,by,Battle, near the banks of the river Murum in the South. His father was a revered physician known as Nampar Gyalwai Dawa and his mother was known as Rigdenma. The family had two sons: the first was Lodro Phak, and the second was Sonam Phak. The younger son vanquished the pride of the elder, and to destroy his father's pride in his accomplishments as a physician he composed medicine texts known as the Four Branches of Benefit, Equalizing the Four Elements, Correct Diet, and others. One day, the son prostrated before his father and set out for the great university ofNalanda where he was ordained a bhikshu by the Abbot Rahula Badra, and given the name Lodro Sangpo. For three years he practiced the teaching on the Knowledge of Machya (Peacock) Sutra and achieved"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"ATISHA 155 the signs. He then went to Likhara Shingphel to beg alms. Entering the house of a goldsmith, he saw that he was practicing the alchemic art of transmuting base metal to gold. Merely by observing he immediately grasped the technique. The Abbot appointed him as overseer of his monastery while he went into retreat in a solitary place in the forest. When a famine occurred in the area, Nagarjuna used the alchemic technique, supporting all the monks through the gold he created. When the Abbot returned to the monastery after six months, he struck a rock with his walking stick and transformed it into gold. The Abbot said, \"If you had informed me of a famine, I would have caused a rain of barley to fall and a clay representation of a cow to give milk. But instead you maintained the monks through impure action. You must leave this place.\" Nagarjuna prostrated before the Abbot and planned to go to Palkyiri Mountain in Southern India. On an island in the ocean lived a man known as Zwayapala who was able to transform rock into gold, cause a rain of jewels to fall, and a drawing of a cow to give milk. So Nagarjuna proceeded there and learned those arts. He then went to Palkyiri and through the art of extracting nourish, ment from inanimate objects remained there six hundred years. Causing a rain of jewels to fall on the poor of the city, he became known as Bhikshu Shiri. He also transformed the Belt Mountain into gold, and caused milk from a drawing of a cow to flow in such profusion that travelers were able to drink for a year. Nagarjuna became an object of worship for King Thardro Zhonnu. Once, while the King was at war, his wife became enamoured of Nagarjuna and suggested that they live together. When Nagarjuna refused, the Queen became so angry that upon the King's return she told him that Nagarjuna had made the suggestion, but that she had refused. In this way, the King and his retinue lost confidence in Nagarjuna, who felt obliged to depart the kingdom. But before doing so, he wrote the following verse:"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS The nature of woman Is not recognized by the ignorant Because of their obscurations. When a woman loves a man She will stay with him as long as it suits her. But she will discard him in a moment When she is no longer interested. This is her nature. Women are not stable of mind; Skillful men should beware. He left this verse at the house of a goldsmith who became abusive of him. To show the smith his powers, Nagarjuna transformed a rock into gold and gave it to him. Thereafter, he proceeded South. Meanwhile, King Thardro Zhonnu discovered Nagarjuna's poem and realized that it was his wife who had been at fault. So he asked that Nagarjuna return, but the latter refused. However, he sent the formula for his technique of extracting food from inanimate objects, and promised the King a life, span of six hundred years. The King was overjoyed and ruled the kingdom according to the Dharma. There was no branch of knowledge unknown to Nagarjuna, and he composed myriad different texts, thus benefitting many sentient beings and causing the teachings to flourish widely. In the Manjushrimula Tantra it is written, \"At the end of time a powerful one will appear who refutes all argument, and the scandalous mantras of heretics.\" It is also said in the same text: At that time there will come my bhikshu, The learned one who will be known as Servant of the Mother.

During that time beneficial causes Will arise to help all sentient beings. Through this virtuous karma This wise person will be reborn in higher realms, Will gradually experience various forms of bliss, And will achieve the omniscience of enlightenment And the inconceivable ultimate state. Thus he said. 157 Chandrakirti was a disciple ofNagarjuna, who was adorned with many samadhi and realization qualities. He lived four hundred years in the human realm, spending about one hundred of them at the feet of Nagarjuna. His disciple, the"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS great master Rigpe Khuchuk, attained the Bodhisattva's bhumis and lived three hundred years. In tum, his disciple, the elder Kusali, achieved bhumis as an upasaka (house-holder keeping the precepts). His disciple, the younger Kusali, lived two hundred years during which he attained bhumis, became a bhikshu and achieved the realization of Mahamudra. His disciple was Atisha, who attained avadhuti in seven years. C. The Profound Blessing Meditation Experience Lineage The great Vajradhara gave teachings to the Master Tilopa, who was an emanation of Vajradhara. He, in tum, gave teachings to glorious Panchen Naropa, who gave them to the great saint Dombhiwa, who gave them to Atisha. Atisha directly realized Naropa, who placed his hand on Atisha's head and said, \"All the Buddha's teaching is given to you.\" II. POSSESSING THE THREE TRAININGS AND KEEPING THE THREE VOWS PURELY Atisha was born as a Prince. His father, who was known as Gewai Pal (Glorious Virtue), was King of Bangala in the East in the city ofVikrama Puri in the region of Lahore. His influence was as great as that ofTongkun, King of China, for he controlled an area equal to two million, seven hundred thousand courtyards. His mother was Queen Palmo Oserchen (Glorious Radiating Light). They had three sons: the eldest was known as Padma Nyingpo (Essence of the Lotus), the middle son was Soma Svara or Dawa Nyingpo (Essence of the Moon), and the youngest was Palgyi Nyingpo (Essence of Glory). Padma Nyingpo had three consorts and nine sons, the eldest of them being Sonam Pal who later became a great scholar and monk. He was known as Dhana Shri Pandita, and wrote a commentary known as The Wisdom Path of the Bodhicharya Avatara. The middle son was Atisha, and the youngest was a monk who became known as Bhikshu Virya Chandra. Until he was twenty-one, Atisha studied the sixty-four arts, all the arts of sound and logic. He also received"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"ATISHA 159 complete empowerments from Rahula Gupta Vajra and Lord Yonden Sangpo (Gunabadra), who was a great master of realization. In addition, he received the vision of Hevajra and instructions from the Vajra Dakinis. At the temple known as Rinak (Black Hill), Atisha was given the name ofjnanaguya Vajra. When he was staying at Vikramalashila University, he received the empowerment of the completion stage from Avadhuti, a disciple of Naropa who was born in Bangala, and who possessed the quality of foresight. He remained seven years with Avadhuti perform-ing the Avadhuti action in the upasaka precepts. He also received many Tantra teachings, especially the stabilization meditation. Once he came to the central country, where in a dream he saw a temple filled with monks, which he greatly desired to enter. But one of the monks said, \"This place is only for monks. As you are a lay person, you are not allowed here.\" When Atisha awoke, he thought, \"Perhaps I should become a monk. This dream appears to have been a sign from Maitreya.\" When he asked Upasaka, who had a good knowl-edge of Dharma, Upasaka told him he should be ordained by the master Sangye Yeshe (Buddha Jnana) of the Mahasangika School, which more readily offers the Tantra teachings. Atisha preferred to be ordained in the Arne School which used Sanskrit, but they refused the Mahayana as the Bud-dha's teachings. Upasaka again urged that he be ordained in the Mahasangika School. Thus, at the age of twenty-eight, Atisha was ordained by the Abbot Shila Rakshita, who achieved higher realization and possessed the quality of samadhi. The Mahasangika School arose from the master Yeshe Sangye. At Bodh'gaya Mativihara, Atisha was given the name Dipankara Shri Jnana (Glorious Wisdom Source of Light). From then until he was thirty-five years old, he studied the three yanas from many masters and attained omniscience.

When he studied the art of sound, he memorized a chapter of the text each morning and evening, but feeling that this was not sufficient he meditated on Saraswati [the embodiment of wisdom in female form] until one day at dawn he actualized the art of sound. Saraswati appeared to him and said, \"You are realized.\" He also studied a non, Buddhist text on sound called the Ught of the Word by the Brahmin Norlha, and others. Among Buddhist texts composed by Tsandra Gomi [contemporary with Chandrakirti] he studied the T sandra Byakarana and the Mani Byakarana, the Pani Byakarana, the Indra Byakarana, the Radza Byakarana, and many others. These are the sci, ences of sound and language. In logic, Atisha's non, Buddhist studies included texts by Rishi Akshipada and many others. His Buddhist studies included texts by Acharya Oiknak called Pramana Samuccaya and Pramana Vartika, six texts by Acharya Dharmakirti, and one text by Acharya Shanti Rakshita. In this way Atisha studied widely. He also investi, gated the science of healing, studying texts written by rishis such as Rishi Lekthong, writings by the Buddha, and medi, cine texts including the Four Branches composed by Arya Nagarjuna, and the Eight Branches composed by Ashvaghosha. In addition, Atisha mastered the arts of wood cutting, sewing, image,casting, drawing and others. Among the non, Buddhist texts he studied the Great God Shankara, and among Buddhist texts one by Arya Nagarjuna. He also studied the science of the inner meaning, including the Tripi taka of the Mahasanghika, the Sarvastivadi, the Abhidharma, and the Sutras of this tradition. He studied the four categories of Vinaya and the Great Abhidharma Treasure Teachings ofVesheshika in eight hundred chapters compiled by Arhat Upa Gupta, which are common to all four lower vehicle schools.

The Secret MantTa Vehicle His secret mantra studies included: the four Tantras of the Secret Mantra Vajrayana; the Tantra of the Origin of Tara; the TantTa ofTsundana; and the Tantra ofManjushri. Within the Charya Tantra he studied the Tantra of the King of the Three Samayas and the Tantra of Complete Enlightenment; within the Yoga Tantra the Tantra of the Collection of Realizations, the Tantra of the Female Vajra, and the Tantra of the First Glorious Supreme; within the Supreme Yogacharya Tantra the Tantra of the Union of AU Bud&ws; and within the Anuttara Tantra division the Guhyasamaja, the Tantra of Method in the traditions of Arya Nagarjuna, King lndrabodhi, and Acharya Buddhajnana, along with the commentaries of the three texts and their instruction. Atisha also studied the Dasang Thigle, the Tantra of the Nonduality of Method and Wisdom, and many others. Within the category of the Tantra of Wisdom he studied the Tantra of Namka Dang Nyampa, the Tantra of the Original Buddha, the Tantra of the lUusory Vajra, and others. In a dream, Atisha offered a handful of pure gold to Pandita Wakishvara Kirti, the Western Gatekeeper at Nalanda, prostrated twelve times, and received from him four hundred fifty,two Tantras. When he awoke, the mean, ing of these Tantras had taken permanent root in his mind. Within these instructions were six Tantras explaining the ultimate meaning of the teachings. Atisha then related to Geshe Tonpa that his pride had been broken by Jomo (a nun) in the following way: In one of his dreams there appeared a monastery containing a moun, tain,heap of texts. A blue lady appeared and picked up a small text at the top of the heap, saying, \"This small text represents the sum of your knowledge of Tantra.\" She then told him the name of many Sutra texts of which he had never heard, asking if he knew of them. In this way he had to alter his proud view that he knew all the Tantric teachings. Geshe Nyakrumpa told the following story: \"In India, even if one is greatly skilled in the knowledge of the five"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"ATISHA aspects, if one does not keep the three trainings, he is considered of no importance, and the texts which he com, posed will be destroyed. On the other hand, texts composed by a scholar who keeps the three disciplines are placed atop the victory banner where their teaching flourishes widely.\" Thus, Atisha was fully trained in the three disciplines and completely mindful of even the smallest moral rules of the Vinaya. He was the complete holder of the Vinaya discipline. In the perfection path of the Mahayana, Atisha cultivated Bodhicitta, steeping his mind in the waters of loving, kindness and compassion toward all sentient beings. With altruistic thought and perfect ethics he directly and indirectly benefitted all. He was a great Bodhisattva who practiced all the train, ings in the Path of the Secret Mantra Vajrayana Diamond Vehicle, in meditation remaining continually united with all the Buddhas. He possessed the vajra mind of realization, thus keeping the morality of the different vehicles, and surpassing everyone in adherence to the discipline. III. SEEING THE VISION OF THE ENLIGHTENED YIDAMS AND RECEIVING THEIR TEACHINGS; REALIZING THE MEANING OF THE SUCHNESS; SPREADING THE TEACHINGS OF THE BUDDHA. Atisha received the visions of the outer Yidam, Jo Meyuwa, Arya Avalokiteshvara, Tara, Damtsiksumkopa, and others. He also had visions of the inner Yidam, Shri Hevajra, and others. Through their blessings he received many teachings both in the waking and dream states. At times when he meditated one,pointedly to transform events, he would see clearly in his dreams what would transpire. He possessed the wisdom of the three times. Reciting the hundred,syllable mantra of the Tathagata in Tibet during the new moon, Atisha received the visions of the Buddhas of the ten directions. He remained continually in the presence of these Buddhas, making offerings to them and benefitting all sentient beings. Atisha was a great Bodhisattva free from all controversy. Even ordinary beings perceived him as a second Buddha, and"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS his fame pervaded the world, causing him to become the master of all other teachers. Thus, during the reign of the King Dewa Belpo, the great master Dipankara Shri Jnana invited him to Vikramalashila from Bodh'gaya, and he became the crown ornament of the kingdom. The Building of Vikramalashila A yogi from Central India, wishing to obtain the powers of a King, practiced the meditation of Lhamo Oser Chenma. Accomplishing the meditation, he received a prediction to go to Bangala in Eastern India. Journeying there, he found that every inhabitant took his turn being King for one day, after which he inevitably died. That particular day it was the turn of a son of a shepherdess, who was very distressed about the situation. When the yogi asked the cause of her woe, she told him the story and he said, \"May I then take his place?\" The woman was overjoyed. When the yogi was enthroned, he discovered that the Queen was an evil Naga. She advanced with the intention of eating him, but being armed with confidence in his medita-tions, he managed to subjugate her. Everyone present was amazed and he was empowered as King of that region under the name of Gopala, which means \"He who looks after cows.\" Thus, he ruled all of Bangala and enjoyed the com-pany of five hundred queens, each of whom had a fully-ordained resident nun. As the youngest queen had never attracted the attention of the yogi King, she had her attendant nun perform a special meditation to help her win his favor. The nun then gave the Queen a bowl of cooked meat to offer the King, but when she went to him to make the offering, she couldn't find him. She then threw the meat in the sea, thereby gaining control over the ocean god, who arose in the form of the king. By him she conceived a child, but when the real King heard of this, he asked who the child's father was. The young Queen replied, \"It was you who appeared to me one night,\" thus causing the"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"ATISHA King to realize that the Queen had been tricked by a false manifestation of himself. He therefore hid, waiting for the ocean god to reappear, and when the creature manifested, the King grabbed hold of him, asking the reason for his presence. The god then told him the story of the Queen's meat offering, and said that he had no control over all that had resulted. He asked to be released, offering the King the son whom the Queen had conceived by him. Thus, when the child was born, he was known as Dharmapala, and he caused the kingdom to increase greatly. At that time a yogi who had accomplished the Tara meditation engaged in a war to destroy the heretics in Bhalentara. On the way, he met a black man who said, \"Do not immediately destroy the temple of the heretics; first, dig in this mound of sand and you will find a temple of the Buddha Khashapa. Then, when you enter the battle, make a sound which includes all the harmonies of the universe together, and the heretics' temple will disappear of itself.\" This black being was an emanation of Mahakala. The yogi uncovered the temple, which was known variously as the temple ofTrikaruka, and the temple ofChosomangpuri, and the Hidden Ocean. Then he entered into battle, causing all musical instruments to sound at once. Hearing this, all the heretics were instantaneously subjugated, and the whole of Bhalentara was placed under the yogi's authority. At that time in the mind of a master called Palgampala, who had gained the realization of Mahamudra, there arose the thought, \"If I were to build a monastery on a rock near the Ganges, the teachings of the Buddha would be greatly benefitted. But the temple would be better built if the con-struction were undertaken by the King rather than by a mere monk.\" So he thought he should cause himself to be born as the son of King Dharmapala. One night the Queen had a dream that a monk wearing the saffron-colored Dharma robes and holding a bowl and staff was saying, \"I seek lodging here.\" Thus, she conceived a"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"166 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS child who, under the name of Devapala, was to become a powerful ruler of the Mangata country, and was to build the monastery he had foreseen on a rock near the Ganges. Its northern gate was named Vikramalashila (The Scent of Morality). The King supplied the needs of twenty-seven monks from each of the four lineages of the Vinaya (one hundred eight monks in all), and the monastery furnished the needs of twelve monks from Tibet, Oddiyana, and other places, as well as seven monks studying the sciences of sound, logic and torma-making. Generally, there were five thousand monks in the monastery, one hundred eight schol-ars, twenty-one great scholars, twelve excellent scholars, seven supreme scholars, and four ultimate scholars. Among these were two great sthaviras, Shrimitra the great Vinaya holder, the great Acharya Naropa, the great writer Wakisha-warikirti, the great debater Ratna Akara Shanti, and Atisha, who was one of the seven supreme scholars. Atisha fully kept the discipline of the four Vinaya line-ages. Within the monastery Nagarjuna's image was erected on the right and Atisha's on the left, in consequence of which Atisha was recognized as the second Nagarjuna. On one side were depicted all the great yogis and on the other all the great scholars, with Atisha appearing among both groups. To fulfill the wishes of the King, Atisha gathered all four Vinaya lineages in the monastery. Generally, his disciples spread throughout India, Nepal, Pakistan and Oddiyana, but there were five special disciples who were like his heart, head, eyes, right and left hands. These were the great panditas Bodhiwa, Ratna Akara, Mati Umasingha, Shenyen Sangwa, and Sai Nyenpo. Although they were not equal to the master in their blessings and other qualities, they were equal in understanding. Atisha also had many realized disciples in India, as well as Bhikshus and Bhikshunis realized in Mahamudra. Because his fame pervaded the ten directions, he was invited to Tibet by the Bodhisattva King. In the Western part of Tibet, the King Trashigon had two sons, Trong Nge and Khore. Of these, Trong Nge had two sons, Nagarandza and Devarandza. As Trong Nge renounced"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"ATISHA the kingdom to become a monk, his rule passed to Khore. Meanwhile, Trong Nge worked hard to re-establish the teach-ings of the Buddha, becoming known as Lha Lama Yeshe 6d. He was considered an emanation of Manjushri, and was prophesied in the Manjushrimula Tantra. Khore's son Ngadak Lhade in turn had four sons: 6d De, Lhatsun Jangchub 6d, Shiwa 6d, and Tangchung. At the time of the Tibetan King Lhate and the Central Indian King Devapala, Atisha was residing at Vikramalashila. In Tibet Lhatsunjangchub 6d was greatly saddened by the decline of the teachings of the Buddha. Further, because Acharya Marpo was translating texts about sang ngak thigle (the secret Tantric drop practice), all the monks were marrying and all the householders were abandoning the Nye-ne discipline, thus causing the teachings to decline. So Lhatsun Jangchub bd twice sent messengers to India to invite Atisha, but as he could not come, Lhatsun thought of inviting a master second in rank. Meanwhile, he sent for a Tibetan geshe, Gungthangpa, who was twenty-seven years old, well versed in the knowledge and practice of the Vinaya, and eager to journey to India for study. When the geshe appeared before him, the King related how the teachings had been corrupted, and how following the tradition of his forefathers who for the benefit of beings had invited thirteen great masters, he had tried unsuccessfully to bring Atisha to Tibet. It remained his hope that Atisha would eventually come to Tibet, but if not, he would accept a master second to him, and for this purpose he proposed to send Geshe Gungthangpa to India. But Gungthangpa said, \"Please do not ask me to do this. I am going to India to study, and this mission would be an obstacle to my work.\" The King said, \"You are not supposed to defy the King's orders, as this is so important a matter. This is my only request. Give me this happiness and I will do something good for you in return. Indeed, I will supply your needs either for your study in India or Tibet, or simply for your upkeep should you decide not to study.\" Strongly requesting the Geshe's help, he left the monk no choice."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"168 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS When the geshe set off to India, the King gave him a large bar of gold and fourteen additional ounces of gold to take to Atisha as an offering. To the monk he gave seven ounces of gold for his own use, and seven more ounces of gold to pay for the expenses of the journey. To a man with a slight knowl~ edge of Sanskrit he gave five ounces of gold, and to three others he gave three ounces each. The five together went to India to seek Atisha. One night after arriving, they stayed in a bamboo hut when a man named Atsara, seeing the gold that they were carrying, planned to rob them. Realizing this, the group fled the hut and went on to Bodh'gaya in central India, from whence, because of the level terrain, they saw the roof of Vikramalashila, three days' journey away. A law in the land forbade them to cross the Ganges in daylight, but they persuaded a sailor to take them across in the evening. When they reached the monastery early the next morning, they heard someone reading a Sutra in Tibetan. It was the transla~ tor Gya T sondru Senge from whom Gungthangpa had ear~ lier on studied the Abhidharma. When Gya asked if the Geshe was coming to study with the master or carry him away, Gungthangpa replied, \"The King of Tibet sent us to bring the teacher back with us.\" The translator said, \"Just pretend that you have come here to study. There are thirty great scholars after Atisha, such as Tathagata Krita, Sunmate Kirti, Vairocana Krita, the Nepali Kankapi and others. But I will tell Atisha your wish and we will see what will happen. One day the translator called the Geshe to Atisha's cell, and the Geshe placed before him all the King's gold as a mandala offering, explaining that the Tibetan King was a bodhisattva who requested that he come to Tibet. Atisha said, \"Indeed, the Tibetan King is a bodhisattva, and one should not disobey a bodhisattva's orders. Earlier, when they sent messengers to invite me, one of them died. I felt such regret that I did not care to come. This time I will ask Arya Tara whether or not I can benefit sentient beings in Tibet."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"ATISHA Take back your gold.\" So Atisha performed an offering before Tara's shrine, as well as mandala offerings and aspira, tion prayers. Later, Tara appeared in his dreams saying, \"There is a city of heretics known as Chukhyer (Water Carrying) near the Vikramalashila monastery. In the middle of that city is a small old temple where you will find a yogini. Ask her whether you should go to Tibet.\" The next morning, Atisha took a handful of cowrie shells, went to the temple he had seen in his dreams, and made a mandala offering. After a time a yogini appeared with hair flowing nearly to the ground. Making mandala offerings before her, Atisha said, \"The King ofTibet has invited me to his land. If I grant his request, will I benefit beings there?\" The Yogini replied, \"You will benefit many beings, especially one upasaka, but your life will be shortened by twenty years.\" Atisha thought, \"If I can benefit beings, what do I care if my life is shortened?\" And he prepared for the journey, telling the messenger from Tibet, \"I will not undertake any new activities, but just to complete what I have started will take eighteen months. Can you wait that long?\" Geshe Gungthangpa replied, \"For you I would wait even three years.\" Atisha said, \"Then, until I am ready to depart, use your time to study.\" Because he was near the master Atisha and the translator Gya T sondru Senge, the monk was able to accomplish much during his time in India. After completing his work at the monastery and before leaving for Tibet, Atisha made a series of brief journeys to accustom the monks to his absence. At last, the day arrived when Atisha was able to tell the Geshe, \"We must now go to Bodh'gaya to make offerings individually.\" He then sent all his texts ahead to Tibet in the care of Gya Tsondru Senge, but the translator died on the way. Gungthangpa worried over the fate of the texts, but Atisha calmed his mind. Atisha came to Nepal where one of his friends provided for his needs for one month. At the request of the people there he composed the text known as Chodu Dronme (The"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"I 70 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Lamp of Brief Action). From there he proceeded to Mang~yul in Western Tibet where he stayed for one year. He then went to Lake Manasarovar near Mt. Kailash through Purang. One day, they stopped for a noon break. Meanwhile, Atisha was performing a water offering ceremony. Gung~ thangpa asked if he might record it. This became known as the water offering of Khasarpani, which is a special offering on the visualization of Chenrezig. Atisha then went to Tulung where the King welcomed him. There he met the great translator Rinchen Tsangpo who, though a great scholar, lacked a profound understanding of actual practice. Rinchen Tsangpo therefore requested that Atisha give medi~ tation practice teachings. Thereafter, when he practiced the Guhyasamaja, he received the vision of the enlightened deities. He and others translated many texts and refined those translations which had been done before. Together with Atisha, they gave teachings to many people. Gungthangpa said, \"Now the great master has only one year to remain in Tibet. Then he must return to India according to the agreement he made with his Indian disci~ ples.\" Knowing that Atisha's time in Tibet was limited, many people flocked to him to receive teachings while they could. The King, Jangchub Od, made an offering of three hundred ounces of gold and asked Atisha five questions: (1) \"Atisha,\" said he, \"you are a great master. Here in Tibet some masters say that the Hinayana and Mahayana have existed from the beginning, while others say that they have existed indefinitely, and that Hinayana can cultivate Mahayana thought. Which view is correct?\" Atisha replied, \"As Tibetan scholars are meditating on the Dharma I will answer you in time.\" (2) In like manner the King asked his second question: \"In Tibet some masters say that the differ~ ent stages of realization arise from meditation practice, whereas others say realization arises spontaneously, thus eliminating the need for meditation. Which is true?\" (3) The King's third question was, \"In Tibet some scholars say that skillful means, or method and wisdom, should be united."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"ATISHA 171 But others say they should be kept separate. Which is true?\" ( 4) His fourth question was, \"In Tibet some masters say we need the Pratimoksha vows as a basis for the Bodhisattva vow, but some say not. Which is true?\" (5) The fifth ques-tion was, \"In Tibet some say that monks should be given the secret wisdom empowerment and some say they should not. Which is true?\" To answer these questions Atisha composed a text known as the Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment. To the first question he replied: The final vehicle is one, But relatively there are three categories of beings; Those of inferior, middling and superior capabilities. To show that it is necessary to do meditation practice for higher realization, he replied to the second question this way: Meditation practice is needed. Through this practice One will gradually achieve wisdom heat and so forth, As well as the supreme joy and others. Thereafter, full enlightenment is not far off. To show that it is necessary to unify method and wisdom, he replied to the third question thus: Wisdom without method And method without wisdom Remain in bondage. Therefore, one should abandon neither. To show that it is necessary to have any one of the Pratimoksha vows to cultivate bodhicitta, he replied to the fourth ques-tion in this way: Having any of the seven Pratimoksha vows Establishes the basis for the Bodhisattva's vow. Without these there is no Bodhisattva vow. To show that the secret empowerment should not be given to celibates he replied to the fifth question thus:"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"I 72 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Celibates should not be given The secret wisdom empowerment. This text Atisha composed from his personal meditation experience. Atisha was then asked to compose a meditation practice on the principal mandala deity as Chenrezig, based on the Guhyasamaja Tantra. In reply, he composed the sadhana of Chenrezig which, when the King Jangchub Od practiced it, enabled him to receive the vision of Chenrezig directly. In Shangshung where he stayed for one year, Atisha produced many realized disciples. Then he returned to Purang where the elder monk Serso achieved clairvoyance merely by attending him. He could see mines beneath the ground. The Story of Geshe Tonpa' s Meeting with Atisha At Gyashing in Purang he met Geshe Tonpa who had been born in the North Central part of Tibet to the Orin clan. As his mother died young, Geshe Tonpa was reared by a stepmother. One day he threw a stone at a dri which his step,mother was milking, thus causing her to spill the milk. In anger the woman beat him, and he decided to leave home. At this point he met the master Setsun Wangchu Zhonnu, who was a disciple of Pandita Jnanakirti, and had studied in Tibet and Nepal. From Nepal Setsun planned to go to India, but meanwhile he met with an Indian magician. As Setsun, for his part, was learned in astrology, the two men were known as the two clairvoyants. One day, as they sat next to each other on neighboring thrones, the magician placed a vase on empty space, chat, lenging Setsun to equal his power. By doing astrological calculations, Setsun was able to see that the magician's father's head was lying under a stupa. \"If you continue to practice magic,\" he told the magician, \"your father's head will be buried beneath a stupa.\" Thenceforth the magician regarded Setsun as an enemy, so the latter returned. At this point Geshe Tonpa, who was seventeen years old, met Setsun and received teachings from him. Setsun went to"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"ATISHA 173 Kham where his intelligence and way of teaching resembled Atisha's. Later, Geshe Tonpa wished to go to Kham and followed Setsun, but he travelled too far and instead met Dru Namkha from whom he studied the Abhidharma. Later, he met Setsun again and served him devotedly. Because he was wearing skin garments, the clothes stuck to him when the rains came, so that to remove them he had to tear his own flesh. He learned the teachings so well that when anyone made mistakes about them he was able to correct them. Thus his fame grew. Jowo Setsun told Geshe Tonpa, \"As you understand the teachings so well, you must give up all ordinary occupations and study the Dharma.\" So he continued to serve the Lama and to study. Whenever he received offerings he accepted them out of compassion, but as he was little concerned with this life, he never kept more than the little he needed to survive. He was also offered many domestic animals, and at night he wove a protection circle to keep them from harm, all the while contemplating the teachings. In this way he tried to please Setsun, hoping to receive special teachings from him. \"No matter what happens,\" he thought, \"I should please the master. There is no finer occupation than this.\" The many people who came to see Jowo Setsun and receive his blessings remarked on Geshe Tonpa's devotion and service. Around this time, a young monk from Kham who was well versed in the lore of India told Geshe Tonpa the story of Naropa, Shantipa and others, and of their realizations. Geshe Tonpa asked, \"Nowadays, does anyone exist as great as they?\" In reply, the monk spoke of Atisha's wisdom and realiza, tions. The moment Geshe Tonpa heard Atisha's name, the hair of his body stood on end, and he asked himself, \"How can I meet this being?\" In all, he served Jowo Setsun for twenty years, from the age of eighteen until thirty,eight. At the end of that time, he told Setsun that he had heard of Atisha and formed a plan to see him. Setsun replied, \"As your father is still alive, you should see him one more time. Further, I have no need of all my texts, so you can take as many of them as you like.\" Geshe Tonpa loaded a pack horse"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"174 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS with texts and after seven days' journey he and the friend who had accompanied him, Yeshe Gyal, arrived at the lat# ter's birthplace. Geshe Tonpa asked Yeshe if he wished to visit, but Yeshe wanted only to reach his master. At Sokchukha the two met Patsab Berchung who had been studying since his seventeenth year and had a good understanding of the Tantras and other teachings. When Patsab asked Geshe Tonpa to give him teachings, the latter said, \"I have no time to give teachings because there is a great master in Western Tibet who has come from India, and I wish to see him. Next year around this time my friend Ngok Lekpe Sherab will come, and you can receive teachings from him. Master Kuchung from Yonru is also very intelligent; he, too, can give you teachings.\" Patsab then asked if, in the future, Geshe Tonpa would promise to be his teacher. Geshe Tonpa replied that this might happen if no obstacles prevented it. He then said, \"As you have much wealth, build a monas# tery in an isolated place where the monks can study.\" This the man did some time later, in addition offering Geshe Tonpa seven horses loaded with valuable packs. Geshe Tonpa took the northern road, but for a time lost his way. While wandering, he made prayers to the Triple Gem and invoked the Dharma protectors by offering tormas. Next morning he saw from afar a wild horse running down a road. Taking this as an auspicious sign he said, \"Let us follow that animal.\" When the horse rested at night, the men, too, rested nearby. One night Geshe Tonpa had a dream in which a man dressed in rich clothing appeared, saying, \"Lately I bade you farewell; now you will soon meet the pandita.\" When he awoke, he realized that this was an omen from a Dharma protector. At the same time, Atisha had a dream that in three days his new great disciple would come to him. After three days it indeed came to pass that Geshe Tonpa met Atisha, who immediately recognized him and inquired after his health. Geshe Tonpa prostrated three times and made an offering to Atisha of a bolt of silk cloth. He also made offerings to the translators.

Thereafter, he remained at the master's feet, studying the teachings. later, when the two journeyed to Mang-yul, Geshe Tonpa led Atisha's horse the whole way, himself leaning on his walking stick. One day N aktso Lotsawa discovered texts belonging to Atisha, one on exorcism composed by the Indian rishi Nyami, and one a Tantra on the history of Tara. Seeing that Naktso was poring over them, Atisha said, \"Only if I give you permission are you allowed to look at these,\" and he took the texts back. When Geshe Tonpa arrived, Atisha gave him those texts as well as the great Manjushri Yamantaka text. When the two came to Mustang, Geshe Tonpa received the vision of Tara. Then they journeyed to Mang-yul Sone Chenmo, where they stayed one year. There, the great meditators Zhonnu T sultrim and Shangtsun Trime received teachings from Atisha, in particular the practice of Tara which immediately enabled them to receive a vision of Tara. Thereafter, the meditators supplied all Atisha's needs for some time, translated many Tantra teachings, and taught many Prajnaparamita and Tantra teachings. From India the King and others sent messengers to bring Atisha back, and Atisha made preparations to return since his three years were completed. But on the way to Nepal they encountered wars and upheaval, so they were unable to proceed. They therefore stayed two years in Mang-yul, build-ing there the Keru temple. As the Tibetan King had asked, Geshe Tonpa also told Atisha about Samye and other monas-teries, and about the number of monks who inhabited Cen-tral Tibet, asking if Atisha might not go to those places. But Atisha said, \"It is too far.\" later, as they were talking together, Geshe Tonpa again brought up the topic of the monasteries. Atisha was gratified at the motivation that existed in Tibet and did prostrations toward that land. \"All the Tibetans are part of the Mahayana family,\" he said, \"and though it may be difficult for them to achieve the arhat state,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS some surely will achieve the level of stream winner. So great a number of monks does not exist even in India.\" Encour, aged by his words, Geshe Tonpa renewed his plea that Atisha might come to Central Tibet. Atisha replied: I have promised to achieve the benefit of the sanghas And not betray their request. Therefore I will go If the sanghas wish to invite me. So Geshe Tonpa sent the following message to powerful persons in central Tibet: In J ambudvipa, shaped like the wheel of a horse,drawn cart, In a place in the north near Loti (Tsangpo River) In the glorious Himalayas Lies the source of many precious jewels. It is known as the Land of Snow. There reside the Tibetans, Great of mind, strong and healthy. The King, a great Bodhisattva, Attended by retinues of great warriors, Translated the teachings for the benefit of others And built monasteries like Samye and so forth With the richest materials And noble proportions. To fulfill the wishes of these great beings Who cause the nectar of the teachings to flourish, I, the upasaka Gyalwa Jungne, With deepest respect address: The followers ofShakya, that Lord of Beings [Buddha], Who is a great Bodhisattva worthy of devotion; Lhatsun Bodhi Ranza, Gelong Longchen Pon, And the great saint Sumpa Yeshe Lodro-The three Mahayana pillars Who keep firm the Mahayana lineage; The two spiritual masters who open the eyes; The twelve glorious masters and two great masters of conduct"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"ATISHA Who maintain the discipline according to the Dharma; The two brothers, masters of the Dharma college; Wangchuk Gyaltsen, who fulfills the wishes of spiritual friends; The two sons of Shakya Zhonnu Gyalwa; Lekpe Sherab, scholar and saint and so forth; The noble bhikshu sanghas; And all disciples and patrons. I pray that you are all well And encountering no obstacles To the enlightenment path. Now, in a brief way, I will say this: As you know, there has come here A great scholar whose name is Shri Jnana [Atisha], The most highly respected master in India, Who possesses limitless qualities. When he spoke with the King He was told of the land of Central Tibet, But refused to journey there saying, \"It is too far.\" Later, in Shulka in Nepal, I told him again of the monks in Central Tibet. Pleased was he, and with devotion did prostrations Saying, \"So great a number of monks does not exist even in India.\" By his speaking thus, I was encouraged And hoping that you, too, desired to see him, I requested again and again That he come to Central Tibet. Atisha said that as he promised to benefit the sangha And not betray their wishes He would come If the sangha asked it.

Please meditate on this virtuous letter Which is written for the benefit of all To the monks of Shakya, For it is filled with many meaningful and useful qualities. Try to achieve virtue and meaning in your conduct. Myriad monks of Central Tibet arrived in a procession to invite Atisha to their land. They stayed three months and five days. In Shultsang during that time Atisha gave many teachings and established multitudes in virtue through the cultivation of Bodhicitta and so forth. He expounded the meaning of the Tantra teachings, established the monks in the proper discipline, and cut doubts at their root. At Nyangro Atisha met with Great Yogin and Gonpawa. Through Atisha's teachings Geshe Yulsang received the vision of the eleven-faced Chenrezig. Then Atisha went to Rong where he gave teachings to Garge, who received visions of Chakrasamvara and Vajrayogini. Atisha then went to Samye and translated the Fi~-skandha Madhyamika. At the request of Ngok he also translated the six Madhyamika texts ofNagarjuna. From there he was invited to Garchung by Kuton. Then he went to Solnak Thang and translated the Uttaratantra and others. When Kuton invited him to Yarlung, he offered Atisha one hundred ounces of gold. Kuton stayed in Lhading and Atisha stayed in SOlnak Thang. Because of Kuton's great wealth, Atisha announced to an assemblage of followers, \"This KutOn.

Geshe Tonpa said, \"If Great Yogin is not pleased, he can surely leave.\" But Atisha said, \"Even if a messenger went seeking throughout the world, he could not find such a one as Great Yogin; I will therefore not let him leave.\" Great Yogin spoke with Atisha, who removed his hat and said, \"You were hom in Eastern Tibet, and I was hom in Eastern India. Due to the power of our karmic connection, we met here. Therefore, you must not leave. If you are determined to go at all costs, I will go in your place. And if you have the daring to escape, then so be it.\" Then tears came to Great Yogin's eyes, and he promised to serve Atisha for the rest of his life. Atisha was pleased at this. Then Geshe Tonpa said, \"If Kuton is unhappy, I will leave.\" And Atisha said, \"If you go, I will do likewise.\" Geshe Tonpa said, \"He will not accept your leaving.\" Atisha said, \"We have many ways for making this happen.\" Atisha gathered his belongings and returned to a place near Samye. Several monks and Tokton Jangchub Jungne invited him to Chamtsig. There he translated the Tungwa Chishag (The Confession of the General Downfall) and so forth. At the request of Chag Trichag and others he trans-lated the Seven Dharrnas of Chenrez;ig, the Sadhana of the Cultivation of Bodhicitta, Pleasing the Sentient Beings, and a chapter of shila composed by Acharya Gunapravada. In the Mouse Year Geshe Tonpa invited Atisha to the North for a month, offering him eight hundred ounces of gold and one each of one hundred different kinds of rich goods. In the Ox Year Atisha went to Nyethang and lived in a tent until a house was made ready for him. Atisha ordered Geshe Tonpa to build a monastery for monks, but the Geshe replied, \"I already have a monastery, and as long as it stands I will build no other. That monastery is Atisha.\" After Atisha passed away, Geshe Tonpa did indeed build a monastery in Nyethang. In Nyethang Atisha experienced hesitation about one of the teachings. But in a dream he saw Lord Maitreya and"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"180 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS Manjushri surrounded by many Bodhisattvas, discussing the teachings. In this way his questions were resolved. Later Atisha sent gold to India and ordered the panditas there to build eight stupas as protection against the eight fears. He also commanded them to make a representation of the vision he beheld in his dream. All the Indian panditas assembled, and to please Atisha, whom they acknowledged as a great scholar, they invited the most highly skilled artisans of Eastern India to do the work and send the drawing back to him. One day, as Atisha prepared to leave Nyethang, he entered into samadhi, gazing into the sky. Great Yogin offered him water, saying, \"It is time to drink.\" But the water fell to the ground. Geshe Tonpa said, \"Wait a moment, Arne,\" and Atisha at that same instant received a vision of Maitreya. Geshe Tonpa's face grew dark and he said, \"Arne, the two of us don't have the fortune to share this vision.\" In Nyethang a herdsman separated a yak and dri who had been bound together by a rope. After the dri wandered off, Atisha at some distance away said, \"The yak is still in difficulties.\" When they investigated, they found that the yak's feet were indeed entangled in the rope and that he was unable to move. This was proof of Atisha's clairvoyance. Once in Yerpa, Atisha passed unobstructed through the walls of a house. A nun also saw him circumambulating a stupa in the sky. When Atisha crossed the pass called Sapkyi~la, he received an offering from a sick lady in Yerpa. By the time he reached the top of the mountain, he said, \"The woman has died.\" Ngok said, \"Perhaps we should do prayers for her.\" But Atisha replied \"Because of her offerings, she has been reborn in the god realms.\" At Nyethang Atisha became ill and told Geshe Tonpa, \"Perhaps now I will die.\" Geshe Tonpa with tears in his eyes repeatedly asked about his health. Atisha said, \"This sick~ ness represents my co~emergent deities. Please obtain the"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"ATISHA essences of herbs and flowers which prolong life. I will not use them out of attachment to this life, but to practice the essence of Bodhicitta.\" Atisha wanted to send Great Yogin to India with gold, assisted by an Indian Atsara to whom he addressed his words in Sanskrit. As Great Yogin understood Sanskrit, he realized the nature of Atisha's plan. Going to Geshe Tonpa, he told him of what he heard, and asked him to persuade Atisha to allow him to remain. Geshe Tonpa said, \"I will do what you say, but not just now because Atisha has a profound wisdom mind and would guess our plans. But I will address him later, as if by chance.\" Some time later, when speaking to Atisha of other matters, Geshe Tonpa requested that Great Yogin be allowed to remain. Atisha said, \"Great Yogin is a gentle spirit; no one else can accomplish this mission as he can.\" And he sang this song: Supreme generosity is the giving of joy; Supreme friendship is reliability; Supreme achievement is the absence of sickness; Supreme bliss is nirvana. Geshe Tonpa said, \"Rejoice, Arne; this verse is composed for you.\" Atisha blessed a mound of gold, as well as thirty ounces of gold dust placed in a leather pouch. When Geshe Tonpa touched it, Atisha said, \"Give that back to me.\" And again he blessed it. \"You may meet a robber on the way,\" he said to Great Yogin, \"but he cannot harm you.\" Then Great Yogin wept at the thought that he would not see Atisha again. On the way he indeed met a robber, but he was unharmed and soon managed to free himself. When he arrived in Nepal, he learned of Atisha's parinirvana. Before this, however, he had the vision of Lord Maitreya. Atisha gave gold to Geshe Tonpa and said, \"Tell Great Yogin that he should not be proud about his caste or status as a monk, but should only practice the meditation of loving"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS kindness, compassion and Bodhicitta.

His body was cremated. Having stayed two years in Western Tibet, two years in Mang-yul Gungthang, three months and five days in Tsang, and nine years in Central Tibet, Atisha spent a total of thirteen years in Tibet. Geshe Tonpa took Atisha's relics and went to Taklung through Kyichu and from there to Nam. In Nam, he stayed at Chemalung at the invitation of the sons of Patsab Berchung. They offered him the areas known as Charma in Tre, Chemalung in Nam, and Radreng. As Great Yogin was staying at Mang-yul, Geshe Tonpa wrote him a letter asking him to come to Chemalung. In the Monkey Year Geshe Tonpa built a monastery in Radreng. He also built a retreat house for Great Yogin, and houses for the yogin Sherab Dorje Gonpawa and the great meditator Jampa Lodro of Chime. He also added a kitchen and storehouse for their use, and appointed a novice monk to serve them. Yogin Trichog and Chagthar were sent to Nepal to fetch silver which, along with all the offerings Geshe Tonpa received, was used in building a silver stupa in memory of Atisha. Many mantras were placed inside the stupa, which was decorated by the artist Tsekse. During Atisha's lifetime and after, the butter lamps remained lit. All Atisha's disciples gathered in Radreng, and Geshe Tonpa supplied their needs for nine years. On the eighteenth day of the fifth month of the Dragon Year Geshe Tonpa entered Mahasamadhi at the age of sixty. Afterward, the monastery was maintained by Great Yogin."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"ATISHA Great Yogin was born in Eastern Tibet in the Tiger Year. He was one of seven brothers. In that country it was a tradition that families who did not have sons would borrow one from families where sons were plentiful. Great Yogin was therefore given to another family, but soon after, a son was born to them. He then went to yet another family where the same event occurred, causing him to say, \"I am auspicious.\" His mother told him to become a monk, and he took vows with an Abbot wearing a blue shamthab (lower garment). He labored a whole day and night, making tea for the Khenpo. When he became sleepy, the Khenpo would kick him in the head. Once, when his mother visited him, she said, \"Now go to Central Tibet for further study,\" and she supplied him with the necessities, as well as much silk cloth. For three days she remained with him, and when she left him, her parting words were, \"When you get to Central Tibet, may you meet a spiritual master who will choose you for a disciple. May you receive all the teachings and achieve the realization so that you and I both may perfect the path of complete enlightenment.\" Later, Great Yogin thought, \"Perhaps my mother was a Dakini.\" Hearing of the fame of Phamthing in Nepal, he jour, neyed with the intention to meet him. Instead, he met Atisha in Nyangtso, who inquired where he was going. \"I am going to Nepal,\" said he. Atisha, whose clairvoyant powers enabled him to see that this was a proper vessel, said, \"Do not go; I will give you the teachings.\" Then Great Yogin became a bhikshu and Gonpawa became a novice monk, with Great Yogin supplying the necessities for them both. Great Yogin offered all his silk to Atisha and became one of his attendants. Gonpawa began doing meditation and Great Yogin took care of the Radreng monastery for twelve years. He was known as J angchub and died at the age of sixty,three in Radreng. Geshe Gonpawa thought, \"The time has come for me to take care of Radreng Monastery.\" And this he did for seven years.

After the three principal disciples of Geshe Tonpa had maintained Radreng, Geshe Potawa assumed control of the monastery. His family lineage was known as Nyo and his father was called Tripo. His name as Abbot was Dorje Wangchuk, and his personal name was Rinchen Sal. From Lantsul he studied the Vinaya discipline and attended Geshe Tonpa, studying with him for seven years. After Geshe Tonpa's passing, he studied with Great Yogin and Gonpawa, and then went into retreat. After Gonpawa's passing, he governed Radreng Monastery and gathered sixty great disci, ples such as Geshe Langri Thangpa, Shang Nyukrumpa and others. One night he had a clear dream in which he was plowing the ground with utmost difficulty. When he awoke, he interpreted the dream to mean that his teachings were of no use to others. Another night he dreamed he was holding a sword, and he interpreted this to mean that his wisdom was sharp. Then he dreamed that he was blowing a conch shell, which he took as a sign that he would gain fame. Geshe Potawa stayed in the mountain called Phenpo and gained such wisdom that in one verse he could read ten different meanings. Knowing that constant meditation is difficult, he gave teachings in one session. Geshe Potawa was born in the Hare Year and passed away at the age of seventy,nine.

He was born in Nyal, Southern Tibet, to the clan known as Nyi. His father, Nyiwa Lhaje, had four sons of whom Gampopa was the third. He was named Nyiwa Gunga. Even as a child he was of gentle and compassionate mind, without a trace of anger, enjoying a robust constitution and becoming expert in the arts and all games. By the time he was sixteen years old he was an acknowledged scholar in the study of the Tantra teachings and a great physician. He married and had one child, but because of a plague both wife and child died. For this reason he completely renounced samsara.

He became a well~known scholar and master. At this time he felt the need of doing a meditation retreat, and so built a small house for himself close to the monastery known as Sarka which had been built by his parents. His needs were provided from farm land that he owned. Practicing meditation diligently, Gampopa could remain in samadhi for thirteen days at a time, putting at rest within himself the seeds of desire and hatred, and all gross and subtle negative emotions. He had little need of sleep, but when he did dream, he received the sign of the ten bhumi levels of the Bodhisattva path which are explained in the Golden Light Sutra. Not only did lice and other insects and germs keep their distance, but he could go for five days at a time without taking nourishment. Through meditation Gampopa experienced great bliss. Once, during the spring, Gampopa came out of retreat and went for a walk around the monastery. While in a meditative state, he came upon three beggars talking among themselves. As he made the mudra of offering water to the hungry ghosts, one of the beggars said. \"We are the poorest people around. I wish we could obtain food and drink with~ out working. How wonderful that would be!\" The second beggar said, \"While you're at wishing, don't leave it at mere food. Make a wish to become a King like Tsede of Tibet.\" The third beggar said, \"Even T sede will one day die, so his happiness is not lasting. As long as you are going to wish, wish to become a great yogi like Milarepa who needs no clothing or human food. He is fed nectar by the Dakinis, rides atop a white snow lion, and flies in the sky. Now that would be truly wondrous.\" Merely by hearing the name of Milarepa the hair of Gampopa's body stood on end, tears came to his eyes and a special devotion, unlike any he had felt before, emerged in his mind.

His teacher was Marpa Lotsawa, whose teacher was the glorious Naropa.\" \"What kind of teaching does he offer?\" asked Gampopa. They replied, \"He teaches the Six Yogas ofNaropa, and we haven't seen him, but many people go to him to receive teachings.\" Gampopa said, \"What qualities does he possess?\" and they replied, \"Though many people go to see him, sometimes they do not find him. Some perceive him as a white chorten, and some as Buddha Shakyamuni, so clearly he can manifest in many different forms.\" \"And where does he reside?\" asked Gampopa. They replied, \"He stays in the mountains of Nyanam and Orin.\" Gampopa asked, \"If I wish to go there, can you lead the way?\" They said, \"You look young. We cannot keep up with you, so go in that direction and when you arrive in Lato you will find him, for he is well known there.\" Gampopa then offered them a great supply of vegetables and other food. That night he invoked the Triple Gem before sleeping, and in his dreams saw himself blowing an enormous trumpet whose sound pervaded the whole of the earth. Indeed, people were remarking that there was no larger trumpet in Central Tibet. Then an enormous drum appeared in the sky unsupported, and when he beat upon it, it made a perfect sound. Many wild animals heard the noise, and many people gathered around. A lady dressed in the fashion of Southern Tibetans appeared, saying, \"Beat the drum so that all may hear.\" And she handed him a skullcup filled with milk, saying, \"Give this to the animals.\" Gampopa remarked \"This milk is surely not enough for so many animals,\" and she"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS replied, \"Drink this, and not only these animals but all sentient beings of the six realms will be benefitted.

The people who appeared in my dream were symbols of such beings, while the wild animals were symbols of practitioners in retreat. They will be sustained by the teachings of Mahamudra and the methods of Milarepa.\" These events indeed came to pass exactly as Gampopa fore, saw in his dream. Gampopa then sold his farm for four ounces of gold, and set out to find Milarepa in Western Tibet. Mila was surrounded by his attendants Nyishang Repa, Loro Rechung, Gomthak Jodor, Seban Tonchung, Mekong, and Konggur. Nyishang Repa said, \"Milarepa knew that you were coming, and he will accept you as a disciple. Just wait here for a few days, and do not become impatient. You will see him in time,\" and he told Gampopa to settle at a spot under a rock. At last Gampopa was summoned and found Milarepa sitting on a boulder, surrounded by disciples. Performing many prostrations, he offered Milarepa gold and tea. Milarepa said, \"This gold and I do not agree. Use it for your needs while you are in retreat,\" and he returned it. He then asked, \"What is your name?\" and Gampopa replied, \"My name is Sonam Rinchen [Precious Merit].\" Milarepa repeated the name Sonam three times and said, \"The merit comes from great accumulations, and the preciousness refers to your value to all sentient beings.\" Then he sang a song, saying, \"This is my greeting to you, master from Central Tibet.\" Gampopa collected firewood and stored it in his cave, and gave one ounce of gold to his patrons Konchog Bar and Barye with the request that they supply him with food during his retreat.

So practice my tummo teachings and you will see the true nature of the mind. The Tibetans did not allow Atisha to teach the Tantras.\" Gampopa said, \"There are many Tantric teachings in Kadampa,\" to which Milarepa replied, \"Yes, there are Tantric teachings, but no quintessence instruction there. Although there is a complete arising and completion process in a single meditation practice, this is merely the samadhi of analysis. Meditating on the selflessness of the stages of the path has only a relative value. Practice meditation on the method path.\" Gampopa then received the tummo teach~ ings, experienced heat, and after seven days received the vision of the Five Dhyani Buddhas. When he recounted this to Milarepa, the latter said, \"This is like seeing two moons by applying pressure to your eyes, and it occurs through the control of the wind element. It is neither good nor bad. Continue with your meditation.\" Gampopa thought, \"Though the Lama has not said that this is a good quality, I feel joy nonetheless.\" And he exerted yet more effort in meditation. After three months, Gampopa one day saw the entire universe turning like a wheel. He began to run, but fell down and for a time lost consciousness. Upon returning to his senses, he told Milarepa, \"The wind in my right and left channels entered the central channel.\" Milarepa said, \"This is neither good nor bad. Go on with your meditation.\" Another time in early morning Gampopa saw myriad Chenrezig forms seated on moon discs, filling all of space.

The thirst of your mother comes from the opening of the lower end of the central channel. Do the following yoga exercises and meditate for one month,\" and he indicated a special yogic technique. Doing this practice, Gampopa began crying and trembling all over uncontrollably. It seemed to him that this was an obstacle of the Maras, but Milarepa told him, \"The heart chakra is filled with thigle. Do the yoga exercises I gave you regularly. These signs are neither good nor bad.\" Thereafter, Gampopa had little need of food. One day Gampopa saw the moon in eclipse, as fine as a horse's hair. The wind in the right and left wind channels merged in the central channel. \"This is neither good nor bad,\" said Milarepa.

In the early evening, when Garnpopa meditated on holding the wind, he saw the limitless sarnbhogakaya Buddhafield, and experi-enced its enjoyments. When he released the wind energy, twilight fell. Thinking that he might have created obstacles in the meditation, he began making mandala offerings and saying prayers. At dawn, as he retained his wind energy, he saw the faces of the thousand Buddhas surrounding Shakyarnuni. When he went to Milarepa at daybreak to recount his experience, the latter said, \"Now you have seen the Yidarn deity and the sarn-bhogakaya and nirrnanakaya spheres. Soon you will see the dharrnakaya sphere. Journey to Central Tibet and do medi-tation practice.

Now you will face the dangerous path of clairvoy, ance, also filled with obstacles. When you achieve this state, you will experience the dangerous mara of the son of the gods. 1 It is important to keep this and all siddhis you obtain secret. Generally, this Mara cannot penetrate superior beings, and as you are a superior being you must keep your tantra practice secret. You will benefit many beings, so sustain the assembly of disciples.\" Gampopa asked, \"When will it be the right moment to gather disciples?\" and Mila replied, \"When you see the true nature of the mind and stabilize it. Test if you can send the wind through the fingertips. When you can do this, you are free from the dangerous narrow path of the wind.\" That night Gampopa piled a heap of dust on a rock, placed his fingertips upon it, and practiced retaining the wind. At midnight the dust began blowing around in a circle like a whirlwind. In the morning he told Milarepa, who said, \"You have become master of the wind practice; it is now channelled properly, so you have no further need to stay with me here. You will receive miraculous powers and manifesta, tions and the ordinary and extraordinary attainments, and will be called Bhikshu VajradhrikJambudvipa Kirti [World, Renowned Vajradhara]. Milarepa then gave him all the empowerments, teachings and blessings which he possessed, and said, \"Now return to your own country and practice. Do not befriend those having an increase of the three poisons, for you can be influenced by them. There are beings full of anger, who heap abuse on others and on the Dharma. In such beings' minds, hatred blazes like fire. For example, a snake, although without wings and feet, is nonetheless an object of fright to many because of its strong anger. When one has strong anger in the mind, one perceives everyone as the enemy. And a person who is greedy, even to gathering small pebbles, and who 1 the sense of pride."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"GAMPOPA 195 gathers everything lest he should one day be in need, is as filled with burning desire as boiling water is with heat. Likewise, beings who do not feel it is time to meditate on the practice of the perfect meaning, who believe it is impossible to achieve Buddhahood within one lifetime, and who take no care to develop Bodhicitta will fall into the shravaka path. And those who reject the special method fall into the state of nihilism which is bound by ignorance. So don't deal with such persons. If you speak with them, they will first ask about your teacher and the kind of teaching you are studying. If you tell them, they will become angry, hate the teachings and the teacher, give up all attempts to practice, and be reborn in the hell realms. In that way you would be the cause of others' accumulating negative karma. Therefore, do not keep company with persons having the three poisons. In the samaya, one should not remain with shravakas more than seven days. In general, one should be full of mindfulness, like a bird or a wounded forest animal. Be clean, peaceful, compassionate, kindly to all beings, and devoid of conceptual thoughts. Pass your time in silent retreat, not leaving your meditation seat. And do not aban-don your vajra master, even if you realize the Buddha state. Progress as much as possible in purification and accumula-tion. Work at avoiding even the smallest negative action, even if you perfect the understanding of cause and result. Do not cease practicing the four-session Guru Yoga, even though you have the experience of the inseparability of the medita-tion and post-meditation states. Do not slander the Dharma or persons even when you have achieved the equalization of self and others.\" Gampopa then went to Central Tibet, and by meditating in Sewalung and Gelung realized the basic nature of the mind, and the full meaning of his Lama's words. He thought, \"This is like returning to one's own home, free from effort.\" He realized that this was his last birth in samsara. Meditation brought about the view, like an object returning to its owner."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS He fully realized the Lama's great kindness and thereafter had no increase or decrease in realization, nor any accept-ance, rejection, or doubt. When Gampopa meditated in the place called Sup, he had a dream in which a lady was cutting the throat of her son and crying out, \"Cut the cycle of births. 11 The body of the boy then rolled down the mountain. Thereafter, he had no further dreams, and so his sleep was always an experience of the clear light. Later, Gampopa said, \"It took me a long time to stabilize the mind, and I had to work hard, but for you it will be less difficult to meditate because you possess the instruction of the profound method path. This Kagyupa lineage has a blessing unlike others. If they meditate diligently, many will reach the path. To dispel obstacles, experience the teach-ings, and increase meditation practice, it is enough to follow the profound guru yoga, Mahamudra practice, and Tummo. 11 Gampopa then meditated for seven years in Rolka. Many people gathered there, presenting heaps of offerings which he divided among the area's inhabitants. In the summer he went to Ode Kunggyal mountain. One day around dawn, he heard a voice in the sky saying, \"Neglecting to benefit beings is the downfall of the Bodhisattva. 11 He thought that he should leave because of an expected downfall, but a person appeared in the guise of a king wearing a crown and a giant turquoise around his neck. He promised Gampopa to care for his needs if he would but stay on the mountain, and advised him if he chose not to stay to proceed to Dagla Gampo where his own son would care for Gampopa's needs. \"I am a sky-flying hungry ghost, 11 he said. \"Though I do not mean to harm others, many suffer because of me. I confess my evil deeds and ask that you grant me the refuge ordination and Bodhisattva vow.\" Gampopa gave him the purification method of the four powers, 1 teachings on compassion, 1 the power of refuge, the power of repentance, the power of making a vow, the power of the antidote."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"GAMPOPA 197 refuge, ordination, the Bodhisattva vow, and instructions on Mahamudra. Then, the figure disappeared into space like a rainbow. From there Gampopa went to Dagpo, hoping to do a twelve-year retreat there. For this purpose he built a retreat house in Sanglung, hoping to achieve that state in which one can acquire all necessary nourishment by transforming the elements. However, a lady smeared with ashes and holding three peacock feathers appeared before him, saying, \"It is more important to cause the teachings to flourish than to enter upon a long retreat.\" A few days later, Geshe Gyalwa Chungtsang Chen came to see Gampopa, as did Geshe Nyaknak Marpo. Soon, around sixty disciples gathered about him. After he gave teachings to these disciples, Gampopa again planned to enter a strict retreat, but so many proper vessels arrived from 0, Tsang and Kham that he was obliged to remain and give teachings. Within a short time a great number of disciples arrived who achieved the realization of the teachings, mas-tery over the channels and winds, and the six clairvoyances. These disciples would not accept any form of support with-out first checking whether they came from one of the eight impure sources [whether the gifts had been stolen, etc]. They meditated continuously, not even pausing to lie down, and adopted the twelve ascetic disciplines. Gampopa manifested in limitless forms. People from Dagpo claimed that on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month he went to Lhasa, that on the fourteenth day he prepared a ceremony, that on the fifteenth day he made flower offerings, and that on the sixteenth he did the concluding prayer offerings, making many offerings to other monks. On the seventeenth day he returned to Dagla Gampo Monastery, bringing with him many sacred texts, as well as barley, butter and wool cloth. There, he made dedication prayers. How-ever his patron Gebum, with his retinues, requested that he come to him at the same time. Thus, on the fourteenth he"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS made preparations, on the fifteenth he made flower offerings and on the sixteenth he recited the concluding prayers. Then, along with seven monks, he flew up into the air, which was found by all to be a great wonder. Many offerings were made to the monastery, for which Gampopa did the dedication. At the same time, the monks in retreat declared that on the thirteenth day Gampopa came out of his retreat, that on the fourteenth he gave instructions to the monks from Tsang, that on the fifteenth he gave teachings to the monks from Kham, and that on the sixteenth he gave teachings to the monks from 0. Thus, the group declared that the precious Lama had never left the area at all! However, three of Gampopa's attendants, Selchang, Shegom Changseng and Gompa Lengtse said that during this same time the Lama gave no teachings, neither did he leave the area, nor eat the offerings, but instead sat in solitary retreat. Once, Gampopa's attendant, Gompa Lengtse, remarked to Gampopa, \"In the past, the shravakas achieved great states of samadhi like the overpowering contemplative mani-festation, the all-encompassing contemplative manifesta-tion, and others. How did they attain this?\" Gampopa replied, \"If one practices, there is no reason why one cannot achieve these states. \" One morning when Gompa Lengtse went to the Lama's room to make an offering of yogurt mixed with sugar, he saw a great fire blazing up to the ceiling. So frightened was he that he ran from the room calling another attendant, Selchang. When they returned together, the Lama had transformed the fire into the all-encompassing contempla-tive manifestation, and in this state was simply sitting on his meditation seat. Once, the same attendant went to the shrine to make a butter lamp offering and found the place filled with water. \"What is happening here?\" he thought. The voice of the Lama called out, \"Come here.\" And with that"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"GAMPOPA 199 he transformed the water into the all~encompassing con~ templative manifestation. Again, when the Lama was seated in a room high up in the monastery, the patron Gyalson arrived and asked the atten~ dant if he might see Gampopa and make offerings. When the attendant entered the room to check, he saw a golden stupa radiating light. He then went back to Gyalson with the hope of showing him this marvel, but when the two returned to Gampopa's room, they only found the Lama seated there. Once, Gompa Lengtse, bearing a torma, went to Gampopa's room to receive the Choo teaching which cuts the four maras. Not seeing the Lama there, he went outside, but there was no sign of him there either. Then he heard Gampopa's voice calling out, \"What do you want? Come here.\" And all at once he was seated in his usual place of meditation. Once, Lord Phagmodrupa said to Lopon Gompa, \"Gam~ popa casts no shadow. Have you noticed that?\" So at night, when Gampopa was standing before a butter lamp, Lopon looked and saw that this was indeed so. Again during the day he noted that the Lama cast no shadow. Once, when Gompa Lodro arrived to make an offering of one hundred thousand leaves of paper, he received permis~ sion to enter Gampopa's room. There, he saw the form of the thousand~armed Chenrezig. Returning to Gampopa's atten~ dants, he asked who had built so marvelous a statue, and also where he might find Gampopa. Lengtse led him to the Lama's room, where they found him seated in the spot just occupied by the Chenrezig form. Once, when all the monks in retreat decided to make a great offering to the Lama, they built a giant throne and made tea for all. When Gompa Sheshon went to find the Lama and escort him to the feast, Gampopa gave him his body~touching robe and told him to go on while he himself closed the door to his room. Waiting nearby, Gompa Sheshon looked toward the shrine and saw that the Lama was already seated on the throne. And when he entered the shrine room,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"200 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS the monks asked him why he had not preceded the Lama, taking his robe. On another occasion, Lama Gompa remarked to Gampopa, \"A Bodhisattva who has achieved the first bhumi can dem, onstrate miraculous powers by placing the three thousand universes into the smallest dust particle. The dust particle does not grow bigger, neither do the three thousand uni, verses grow smaller, yet the one fits into the other. How wonderful this is!\" Gampopa replied, \"This is the nature of phenomena. Anything may be achieved. The small eyes of human beings can see the whole of a face; four inches of a mirror can take in horses and elephants; a small bowl of water can reflect the entire moon. Now look at me.\" When Lama Gompa looked, he saw that the Lama had transformed into a Buddha as large as the entire mountain of Dagla Gampo, yet he fit into a room which normally held only five people. His room had not grown larger, neither had his body grown smaller. Once, when the sun was in eclipse, the thousand monks in the monastery saw the Lama flying in the sky and sprinkling water from a vase. Another time, Gargom Karpo requested that the Lama give the transmission of the thirteen Yidam deities. Gampopa agreed, and as he was reciting the mala mantra of the thirteen deities, a red light issued from his mouth and dis, solved into Gargom. Gargom felt great devotion, and as he began doing prostrations, the Lama manifested as the four, faced, twelve,armed Demchog (Chakrasamvara). Once Kyogom, on behalf of his mother, constructed a thangka showing the five Buddha families. He requested that the Lama consecrate it quickly. Gampopa agreed, saying, \"Burn this stick of incense and make a mandala offering.\" He then transformed into the Buddha and from his ushnisha radiated a glorious light which dissolved into the thangka. The air resounded with the tinkle of bells and the beat of the damaru, and the sky was filled with parasols, auspicious banners and canopies. The sound of cymbals was heard, and"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"GAMPOPA 201 a rain of flowers fell. When Kyogom saw this, the Lama said, \"This is the way to do a rapid consecration.\" Once, Geshe Gyalwa Chungtsang Chen thought, \"The precious Lama does not permit the novice monks to do anything but meditation, so how can they acquire knowl, edge?\" That night he dreamed that the entire mountain of Dagla Gampo was transformed into caves, in each of which was a precious stupa beautifully carved and radiating light. Some were fully finished and some were still being painted. Many people were doing prostrations before them, saying that they were the refuge of all beings in samsara, including the gods. Next morning he went to Gampopa's room to tell him of the dream. Before he had time to recount it, the Lama said, \"Generally, those who rely on intellect hate me and have contempt for me, but my novice monks are exactly like the stupas you saw in your dream. These beggar children are the refuge of all the sentient beings in the six realms of samsara, including the gods. I can encompass the needs of all, both high and low. Some say I cause the teachings to decline, but if you watch closely, those who benefit from the Buddha's teachings will be well known in the years to come.\" Radzi Gomkye became adept at meditation merely by hearing the Lama's name. Although Gyasom Dorseng did not see the Lama, he nonetheless mastered meditation through his devotion and mandala offerings. Limitless beings like Nampa Phenne and others achieved meditation merely by seeing the Lama's face. Once, Rukom asked, \"When one achieves the one,taste state, do body, mind and appearance become one?\" Gampopa demonstrated by waving his hand through a pillar. Just as there are no obstructions when one moves one's hand in space, so can body, mind and appearance become one.\" Once, on the way to Drabkyi Tsali, Gampopa crossed the river on his meditation mat while fingering the mala in his left hand, and doing the water mudra with the right. When Gampopa was staying at the mountain ofDregu, the"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"202 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS King Lhagom requested that he consecrate a temple there. When Gampopa threw a flower into the sky, it dissolved into the shrine. At the same time his ritual vase remained in space and his robe hung on a sunbeam. King Lhagom and the others gathered there saw Gampopa in the form of Chenrezig Khasarpani. When he was staying at the Yenphug cave, Gampopa told his attendant Lekse to keep silent for seven days. During this time, he repeatedly passed through cave walls without obstruc~ tion. He also manifested as a gigantic skeleton riding a tiger in the sky, a sword in his right hand, a skullcup in his left, and a khatvanga staff by his left shoulder. Once Gampopa remained for three days standing with his heels together and making the mudra of the joined nectar thumbs over the crown of his head. On the first night he appeared in seven forms; on the second night he appeared in fourteen forms; and on the third night his many forms filled the entire cave. Then all the forms disappeared. Gampopa could remain an entire night breathing in and out only once. Those of his disciples who were weak in realization, those who needed to dispel obstacles, those who needed the teachings to increase their realization, and those who needed the instruction teachings all had their wishes fulfilled merely by performing the torma and mandala offer~ ings and doing yoga exercises. Thus, Gampopa possessed inconceivable and inexpressible qualities, such as the six clairvoyances and others. To demonstrate impermanence to others, this great being, though free from birth and death, left his body on the fifteenth day of the sixth month of the Bird Year at the age of seventy~seven. At that time there appeared in the sky many parasols, banners and canopies, while different kinds of music were heard and a smell of incense pervaded the region.

These phenomena occurred throughout the entire area of Dagpo. When people from the four directions of Dagpo gathered for the ceremony, they saw a rain of blue flowers falling from the sky.

For three days all the people gathered there felt no need of food or sleep, being dissolved in the samadhi of great devotion."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The Glorious Phagmodrupa 1110-1170 The precious Lama Dagpo Lharje, whose coming was prophesied by the Buddha, was a great being who had many highly realized disciples. Among them were four supreme disciples-Dharma Lord Phagmodrupa, Lopon Gomzul, Lopon Gomchung, and Lama Tsurphupa (the first Karmapa); four great disciples-Lama Shri Phagpa, Sergom Yeshe Nyingpo, Yogi Chojung, and Somching Yeshe Nyingpo; and the close disciples Dampa Kyelpo, Gyatsa Repa, Josey layakpa, Dagpo Dulzin, Gargom Karpo, and so forth. His close attendants were Joden Lekse, Chang~ye Salchang, and Badrompa, among others. Of all these, his only heart son, the unsurpassed lineage holder, was the glorious Lord Phagmodrupa. In a previous life Lord Phagmodrupa was the King Pawajin, who achieved enlightenment in the form of the Buddha Shakyamuni. The Samadhi Rajasutra states, \"At one time I was the King Pawajin. My sons from that life, Metok Dadze and Padma Lama, will in the future protect the Dharma.

This is related in the Namchak Barwa Tantra, which describes the Buddha's ema~ nations.

As prophesied in the Prajnaparamita Sutra, the Dharma was promoted in the North through the activity of the Kings and Ministers who are the emanations of Bodhisattvas, and through all the great spiritual masters, particularly the Dharma Lord Phagmodrupa, who emanated in Kham (Eastern Tibet) where the people are strong, brave, dependable, and highly skilled. Generally it is auspicious to be born into a noble family, but in the Buddha's teaching, caste and ancestry are not important. For this reason, Phagmodrupa was born into a poor family. He himself said, \"My father was a cruel man who cultivated non~virtue and misbehavior.\" The family earned their livelihood through impure means, but Phag~ modrupa, like a lotus in the mud, remained unstained. When he was four years old, he took the novice monk's vows from the great Khenpo Phagpa Trulpe, the emanation of the noble Arya, and Yanthub Tsultrim. To give proof of his progress in the understanding and realization of the virtuous Dharma, and to show his own interest, effort, and joyous perseverance, he perfected his training in reading and writ~ ing without relying on others' advice. He also studied and learned the Dharma unceasingly, especially concentrating on the responsibilities of monks. He progressed greatly. Realizing, at the age of eighteen, that one should train in the precious knowledge and wisdom while still young, he proceeded to Central Tibet (0~ Tsang) where there are many great masters. The source of the precious wisdoms resides in the seats of the three great families ofBodhisattvas (Manjushri, Vajrapani, and Chenrezig) from whom one may obtain the wisdom that is like the wish~fulfilling gem. Phagmodrupa was blessed by beings endowed with noble, keen minds, who had earned the wisdoms through study and practice, and who, possessing the merit and power to promote the Buddha's teaching,"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"208 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS demonstrated that only by hard work can one achieve the great quality of study, contemplation and meditation practice. Phagmodrupa offered all his belongings to his Lama and other monks, as well as to friends, hosts and other beings generally in upper and lower Kham. In order to understand the general and particular meaning of all Dharma, and to demonstrate the wisdom realization of all the great Buddha like Panditas, he attended to the great spiritual master Tolungpa Chenpo and many other scholars in central Tibet. From them he received all the knowledge and transmissions. Thus, he became the great master of all the teachings and reasoning of the Buddha and the great scholars. Seeing that the secret Vajrayana is the essence of the Mahayana teach-ings, he studied and practiced all the tantras from the great master of the Four Tantras, so becoming the Lord of the Vajrayana teachings. From the ocean of teachings of the Sugatas he recognized that the quintessential teaching is only achieved by realized and experienced great yogis. To show that teaching to others, he attended the realized great yogi Galo, the Bodhisattva Dawa Gyaltsen, Jomo Lhajema and many others, and from them received the complete instructions. As the Bodhisattva Norsang he received teach-ings and instructions from different Lamas without distinc-tion. Thus, he became the master of all the different aspects of knowledge. He also demonstrated that morality and ethics are the foundation of the Buddha's teaching, the basis of the three trainings, and the only thought of the Buddhas of the Three Times. Without morality and ethics one can no more attain qualities of realization than one can obtain juice from a plant by beating its husk. Thus, for example, Phagmodrupa refused to partake of alcohol even at ganachakra feasts, and though conditions were difficult in Central Tibet, he would not eat even the smallest piece of meat. Whatever he did eat or drink he first blessed.

He never loosened the belt of his robes [to sleep] except when changing his clothes, and if he made even a minor mistake, he immediately purified it in front of the monks. Nor did he collect possessions, such as horses and other animals. In brief, his qualities were inconceivable and inexpressible. From the moment he achieved enlightenment until he passed into parinirvana he served all beings without exception. He paid homage to all his teachers, and received from them the instructions and qualities of a Buddha, like one vase being filled by another. He felt grateful to be a servant of all, taking their hardship upon himself. In the same way he assumed responsibility for all the monks, and concerned himself so little with his own welfare that the only nourishment he took was the remnants of others' food. In his studies he was without pride or jealousy, treating high and low equally. For these reasons he was honored as the crest ornament of all beings. According to the Buddha's teachings, practitioners should study, contemplate and do meditation practice only. Those without proper training, who rob or profit from business, farming or herding, will not achieve these qualities. Phagmodrupa demonstrated the practitioner's life fully. And though he was unequalled in his wisdom and qualities, he continued to search for the qualified Lama, as it is from him that there is the opportunity to obtain the Dharma eye which sees unerringly. But to demonstrate that one can achieve ultimate realization with the transmission of the Lama's blessing, but without dependence on his relative words, he went to Dagla Gampo Monastery as the attendant of Khenpo Rinpoche Shangsumtokpa. By seeing Dharma Lord Gampopa, and engaging in a discussion of three ques, tions, he recognized the nature of the self,awareness wisdom mind, and fully realized the definition and meaning of the general and particular whole Dharma.

He also achieved the meaning of effortlessness, free of all activity. Thus he said: If there is no attachment to experiences, There is therefore no attachment to the text; If there is no end to siddhis, There is therefore no limit to food And no fear of hunger. I am free of the fear of death, And free from the mind's projections. When there is a connection between master and disciple one can, even in a short time, receive all the qualities like one vase being filled by another. To demonstrate this, Phagmodrupa showed the highest respect and ultimate devo-tion to Lord Gampopa during his two-year stay at Dagla Gampo Monastery; and even the master's attendants and senior monks he respected as the precious Lama himself. Generally, he saw all the monks as Buddhas, and did pros-trations to those among them who were senior, as well as to those fully-ordained monks junior to him. He stood up whenever the four noble monks appeared, and paid respect and devotion to even a single word of the Dharma teachings. He was never separated from the Lamas and images of the Buddha. As all rivers converge in the ocean of the Buddha's quali-ties, and as geese are attracted to the lotus lake, countless disciples gathered about Phagmodrupa. Yet to show that one must never break even a single minor precept of the refuge, he kept his life simple in every aspect, for he was indifferent to such things as clothing and food. He made offerings of food and drink to the Triple Gem, and repeated the refuge and Bodhisattva prayers. Indeed, he lived exactly like any ordinary monk.

Free of the five wrong means of obtaining livelihood,1 Phagmodrupa never wasted the offerings he received, but dedicated their merit. Though Phagmodrupa received all the qualities of hear~ ing, contemplation and meditation practice, to serve as an example to others he continued his meditation unceasingly. Once, the spiritual master Lang Senge Gyaltsen, who had received many teachings from Phagmodrupa, requested that the master recount his life story. Phagmodrupa replied, \"I don't have any special qualities to speak of, and I have never thought about this life. Even when I was studying I never interrupted the four sessions of meditation. 11 When the spiritual master Mar Ton jam, who was the teacher of Chungpo Drok, remarked to Phagmodrupa, \"You have the qualities of a Buddha, 11 he replied, \"Even ordinary beings with this kind of effort and perseverance will definitely achieve these quali~ ties. 11 When he travelled a long distance, the rest of his party slept, but Phagmodrupa sat up straight and meditated. He said, \"I fully concentrate on the essence of the meditation practice for the benefit of all sentient beings, and as my practice progresses my five afflicting emotions are self~purified.

Thus, all the disciples gained great experience, had their obscurations dispelled, and achieved insight into the different mind,states of other beings. Even during the waxing moon Phagmodrupa meditated strictly in the mornings, teaching his disciples to do likewise. Dawn, he said, was the best time to gain all the precious qualities, for all the Buddhas achieved liberation at that hour, as well as all the other qualities of the path. So he placed great importance on the meditation practice accomplished in the morning. One text states, \"The Buddha and all his retinues medi, tated in the absorption state until the noonday meal. Then, they donned their Dharma robes and partook of food offer, ings, while devotees did prostrations. After eating, they gave teachings to all who came, including those difficult to tame. In the afternoon, when the mind is clear and the wind cools the heat of the day, they built a lion throne under the shade of the tree while the ocean of the sangha gathered. Seated motionless on the precious throne, the Buddha fearlessly gave the teachings.\" Likewise, Phagmodrupa sat as fearlessly as a lion amidst the ocean of the sangha, gazing on all his disciples and moving his wisdom tongue between his shell, like teeth. The voice of his profound teachings resounded like the song of the nightingale, the roar of thunder, or the melody ofBrahma. These teachings were neither too long nor too short, and included verses from the Buddha, along with the explana, tions and pith instructions empowered by his own profound experience.

From his uncle Khenpo Dharma, who had gathered five hundred Brahmacharya [celibate] disciples, he received teachings and the medita-tion practice of Vajrakilaya and others. When he reached the age of nine, he was already giving meditation instruc-tion, and so began gathering disciples. From his teacher, and from Jetsun Khorwa Lungkhyer, he received teaching and instruction on Mahamudra which he practiced diligently until he was able to achieve the quality of meditation for three days together, not even stopping to partake of food. During the evenings, while in the forest tending animals, he would transform his sleeping state into the clear light. Because he mastered the illusion-like samadhi and other meditation practices, he was able in his dreams to travel to the Buddhafield of Tathagata Arakta Padmasyachakyu, and achieve many great qualities. He received the teachings of Lamrim [progressive stages on the path of study and practice] and all the instructions of Atisha from Master Kyebu Tampa and Master Radeng Gomchen of Kadampa.

After one year the patron Nyasang returned from central Tibet and asked to see him, first offering an immense block of sugar and other things. Lord J igten Sumgon refused to see her, but accepted the offerings through a tiny window. Looking at them he said, \"These things have appeared neither through the merit of myself, nor of worldly actions, nor through the kindness ofNyasang. Rather, they have manifested through the kindness of the Lama and the Triple Gem. 11 He thereupon worked even harder on his meditation practice. When Nyasang returned from further journeys one year later, she heard that the Lama's health had declined through unceasing practice. She therefore brought many further offerings such as tea, butter, and dried meat, and again requested to see him. He agreed to see her once, but later told his disciples, \"The more one seeks to obtain the regard of others, the less one receives it. But if one simply practices Dharma meditation, all good things result.

Thus, word of the power of Lord J igten Sumgon's spells spread far and wide, causing him to remark, \"I received this power and many magnificent bless-ings. Now, whenever anyone dies after a conflict with one of my patrons it is said that this is due to my spells! That is not good, so refrain from concentrating on the ability to cast spells. And if someone dies, don't look upon it as happening through spells.

When he gave them refuge and teach-ings, they ceased all their harmful activities. He actualized the power of the mantras, achieving the results attributed to them in the Sutras and Tantras.

Later, he told his disciples, \"Don't agree to the request of anyone who asks you to delay. When I did, I ate the promise, and it was most delicious!\" Among his disciples at that time was a person called Mogami Gese, who acted as a patron for his travels. The master Sing Sing asked to accompany J igten Sumgon, but the latter did not allow it. So he offered the master a horse, a cloth, and some bags of provisions for travelling, and the journey began. At this time, Lord J igten Sumgon was twenty,five years of age. On the way, he journeyed like the Bodhisattva Sadapra, rudita, constantly meditating on the Lama. He thought, \"Even if the Lama has five hundred disciples whose rank has earned them the white umbrella, 1 I will be chief among them.\" At night when he gazed up at the moon, he felt great devotion, and as tears streamed down his face, he said, \"Even the moon above can see the Lama, but not I.\" Thus he proceeded like the Bodhisattva Norsang.

The next day he awoke and found that the walls of the house he was staying in were covered with the six syllables.

As soon as he arrived, J igten Sumgon called out to be received. A meditator from Kyisho came to meet him, and took him to a house where he rested. The next morning, on seeing a large bat he thought, \"This is an emanation of Phagmodrupa.\" For three days thereafter he had to wait to see the Lama, though Phagmodrupa sent his attendants to welcome him and create a good connection. On the thir-teenth of the month, he was at last allowed to meet the Lama, so he went forth, bearing offering bolts of brocade and silk, along with a horse. Phagmodrupa scolded him saying, \"If I accept the horse, it means that I must either die or leave this place, so I cannot take it.\" J igten Sumgon said, \"Then, should I release him on the mountain?\" When Phagmodrupa scolded him further, Jigten Sumgon wept with devotion and fervor until Phagmodrupa accepted him as a disciple. \"I will give you special care,\" he said, \"and will grant you whatever you wish.

That night in a dream he came upon a golden Vairocana with one face, after which he felt perfectly content. Phagmodrupa then said, \"I have great hope for you. These signs are all due to the power of my magnificent blessings. For your sake I underwent great hardship.\" He"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS He then gave him the one~hundred syllable mantra medita~ tion practice, and the instruction ofMahamudra. Lordjigten Sumgon thought, \"Now I have no need of receiving further teachings. I must simply do the practice. 11 Three disciples from Lhoto remarked, \"What manner of being are you? In the beginning you were so eager that you rushed in here in the middle of the night and now, having actually seen the Lama, you sit in a corner and don't attend the teachings. 11 Lord J igten Sumgon thought, \"What they say is true, 11 so he came into the assembly hall to receive the teachings. There, he made it a practice to recite the seven~branch prayer as many as ten times before Lord Phagmo~drupa even seated himself on the throne. Thus, when he received the teach~ ings, he was able to absorb them all without missing a single word. The news therefore spread that an upasaka from Lhoto was receiving the teachings completely, without missing even one word. Lord J igten Sumgon had great devotion to the entire Sangha, but once, due to an error committed by Geshe Samyepa, his confidence was shaken. However, by medi~ tating on all the monks as his Guru he rediscovered his sense of devotion. While studying and practicing, J igten Sumgon cared little for food and clothing. He never built a fire for his food, or visited others to partake of a meal, but instead remained silent, sometimes making a little soup. At other times he ate food remnants, or drank finely powdered ashes placed in water. At times of rest he went to a place where the monks did prostrations, and said the seven~limbed prayer twenty~ one times. Each morning he did a long session of meditation, while at midnight he went outside and collected leaves from the birch tree for cooking. Many Khampas called him a disgrace to their tribe, but he answered, \"The great lineage masters did not create an easy life for themselves. Like Jetsun Milarepa, I too do not have time for cooking, so perhaps I will not be a disgrace to the Khampas. 11 They remarked, \"He"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"DHARMA LORD JIGTEN SUMGON 23 7 clearly has a lot of pride to speak in this way.\" But later they recognized the sincerity of his practice. Lord Phagmodrupa gave the Great Pointing Out Instruc-tions three times. Though his disciples could not understand them the first two times, they received the realizations at the third try. The master said, \"I was not so clear as you are. You understand the instructions on the third repetition, but I took longer.\" Lord J igten Sumgon achieved the realization that all practice is born in the mind, and later became renowned for achieving the yoga of the non-meditation state, the perfect fifth path. As all phenomenal appearances are actualized in the Mahamudra state, he thought, \"It is enough to practice Mahamudra with great devotion to the precious Lama,\" so he entered Phagmodrupa's presence and recounted this realization. But Phagmodrupa scolded him, \"What are you saying? Until you achieve Buddhahood, you need the five-fold profound path of Mahamudra. Therefore, do not separate yourself from it.\" Hearing that a visitor was coming from afar, he made a large torma from his left-over food and offered it to the Lama, with the request that he might go ahead and meet the person in advance. In Radeng the patron Nyasang gave him two bricks of tea, and urged other patrons to make offerings. After they brought him sweets, hot cheese, tea and butter, he gave them teachings, but he did not have enough time to advise the many others who approached him. When he returned to Phagmodru Monastery, he was at first unable to see the Lama, so he meditated unceasingly in the clear light for three months. At last, he presented his own offerings and those he had been given by others. Phagmodrupa said, \" Put those things in my bag,\" and Lordjigten Sumgon thought, \"Can it be that the Lama keeps anything for himself, even a bag?\" Phagmodrupa told him, \"So far, your karma has been to teach the Dharma only to my patrons. I will see if you can give the proper instructions or not.\" Then J igten Sumgon received further teachings, and had a special insight that he"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS was in fact free from all dogma. Like the meeting of two spaces, the two clear lights emerged in his mind. Phagmodrupa said, \"With this kind of realization you must be born again. Though there have been many highly realized siddhas, all have been reborn because this kind of realization is still not complete,\" and he explained by using many examples and much logic. Once, Jigten Sumgon acquired a brick of tea, and asked the monk Seton if he might make an offering of it to Phagmodrupa. Seton advised, \"You will need this for your-self, so do not give it away.\" As he was not allowed to offer it, Jigten Sumgon later told his disciples, \"If someone asks you whether he might make offerings, always allow him to do so. I was misled by the kindness of Seton.\" To the monks J igten Sumgon twice made offerings of tea, and to Phagmodrupa hot, sweet cheese and other delicacies. All the Dharma instructions were spontaneously established in him. When-ever he saw Phagmodrupa and received teachings from him, he never went empty-handed, but offered whatever he had, great or small. Near the monastery's central shrine was a mandala of four activities, which bore the auspicious signs. Since one was broken, he repaired and offered it. As a result, Phagmodrupa said, \"The auspicious signs now belong to you.\" Later, after Jigten Sumgon improved the mandala yet further, he said, \"I believe my ability to benefit sentient beings arose from this.\" Phagmodrupa urged Lord J igten Sumgon to become a monk, but he thought, \"The life of a yogi is easier for practising the Dharma. Even as a yogi, one must observe social discipline, but a monk is subject to so many more restrictions that he is like an ox whose back is broken by its load of precepts.\" So he decided not to become a monk, but instead practiced the Method Path. When he asked if this practice was correct, Phagmodrupa replied, \"It will be later, but for now do these: one hundred eight mandala offerings, one hundred eight hundred-syllable reci-tations, one hundred eight wind sessions, one hundred eight"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"DHARMA LORD JIGTEN SUMGON 239 circumambulations, and one hundred eight prostrations. Do all of this in six sessions, day and night.\" So Lord J igten Sumgon practiced in this way, enduring great hardships for some time. When he had completed these instructions, he went to the Lama, and smiling at him asked, \"Now may I practice the Method Path?\" Phagmodrupa replied, \"You may do so, and indeed it is necessary.\" He then gave detailed teachings about winds, channels and drops. One day, as Lord J igten Sumgon received the teaching, he developed profound devotion, due to which his winds were naturalized, and many qualities of the Method Path developed within him. Once, when he was going to see Phagmodrupa, he saw important masters gathered there such as Lama Shang, Geshe Dan and others. Phagmodrupa dismissed them, saying that he had important work to do with Lord J igten Sumgon. After they had gone, Phagmodrupa told him to sit in the medi, tation posture. Coming forward, he pointed to }igten Sumgon's three chakras with his walking stick, and pro, nounced the sacred syllables OM, AH, HUNG. Then he said, \"You will be a great meditator.\" Again he said, \"Acting on the meditation, you will be a yet greater meditator.\" A third time he said, \"I am happy that you will be a great meditator. Now go.\" Once, when J igten Sumgon went to see the Lama, he asked, \"Through the meditation on Mahamudra, will the mind be fully pacified at the time of death, or will all this phenomenal world become more clear, enabling me to achieve the omniscient wisdom?\" Phagmodrupa replied, \"You will have the understanding.\" }igten Sumgon thought, \"To achieve this realization, either one should attain the rainbow body and the Dharmakaya mind, or one should have the knowledge of the three times. I may not have those.\" Phagmodrupa insisted, \"Definitely you will achieve this.\" And raising his voice, he said, \"I would not deceive you.\" (Later, when J igten Sumgon did the meditations in Echung Cave, he achieved the omniscient wisdom, and felt content"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"240 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS that he had asked the Lama the questions concerning it.) While still with his teacher, he, along with Lama Tonpa Sherab, received the three-fold Bodhisattva vow, and the Bodhisattva name Rinchen Pal Ratnashri. At last, Phagmodrupa showed signs of becoming ill. J igten Sumgon helped the Lama's attendant Tsangpa Chochang, and offered a handful of medicinal roots. Phagmodrupa was pleased, and accepted them. Gazing on his many stacks of brick tea, he said, \"Though these supplies are here in abun-dance, they cannot help me now.\" J igten Sumgon performed great service with full devotion, and the Lama was very gratified. It was said that if there were three others like J igten Sumgon making long-life requests ofPhagmodrupa, the Lama would surely have accepted. All Jigten Sumgon's belongings he used for the benefit of the Lama and for offerings to the monks. Often, he went to the Lama's room, and at the time of Phagmodrupa's passing a golden vajra bearing a slight stain [signifying that Jigten Sumgon still had further purifi cation to accomplish on the path] was seen to emerge from the Lama's heart and enter that ofjigten Sumgon. From the body of the Lama many blessing relics emanated and his footprints appeared on rocks. Then Lord J igten Sumgon was startled by the appearance of the horse which he had offered the Lama at their first meeting, and which had not been accepted. He sold the animal, but did not receive the money and sugar owed him until eighteen months later. With these he made offerings to the monks, and built a memorial to his Lama. Before J igten Sumgon had come to Phagdru Monastery, Phagmodrupa himself repeatedly predicted, \"My lineage holder will come from Kham; he is an upasaka who will be on the tenth bhumi level.\" When J igten Sumgon arrived, the Lama said, \"Now my wish is fulfilled,\" and turning to Taklung Thangpa, his close attendant and disciple, he remarked, \"Don't mistreat this upasaka. In ages past I was the Buddha Khorwajhik and he was Chenrezig.\" Lord J igten Sumgon had only one piece of cloth to cover"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"DHARMA LORD JIGTEN SUMGON 241 his lower body. When one of his friends offered him another, he sold it in exchange for powdered incense which he sprin~ kled on the memorial to his teacher. From Master Tsilungpa he received further teachings given by his Lama. At this time Sing Singwa and A~gon came to him with a request for teachings, but he would not accept, and sent them to someone else. Instead, he concentrated intensively on meditation, experiencing many obstacles such as seeing lions filling all space and penetrating his forehead, and many similar phenomena. With Master T silungpa he looked over the Lamdre text, but could find no instructions on dispelling the obstacles. And though he did everything pos~ sible according to the various texts, nothing helped him even slightly. For fifteen days he meditated on the statue of Jowo Shakyamuni in the temple in Lhasa as his own Lama, and circumambulated and supplicated him with one~pointed mind, but though this helped, it did not fully satisfy him. Later, all the obstacles were dispelled and he realized the teachings in the Echung Cave where he practiced the medi~ tation unceasingly day and night. When he realized the meaning of dependent arising, his mind completely became attuned to the outer and inner world, and to the causes and conditions which determine whether phenomena act for benefit or for harm. He also fully realized the nature of virtue and non~ virtue, and the meaning of the absolutely permitted and absolutely prohibited. One day he recollected that the Great Vehicle Tantra teachings state, \"The cause of wander~ ing in samsara from beginningless time is due to not gather~ ing the winds in the central channel (avadhuti).\" So he thought, \"If the winds are not gathered in the central chan~ nel, what is the use of this life? If they are centralized, then even dying is acceptable.\" Thus, he practiced the exercise of the coarse winds as if his life depended on it. Through this effort he received the vision of the Seven Taras adorned with the blue utpala flowers, as well as many profound teachings. He also saw the faces of many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS and received the opportunity to purify the six realms. Limit~ less Dakinis invited him to a ganachakra feast, and the worldly deities, creating obstacles in their wrath, were subju~ gated by him, though their unpleasant odor filled his cave. In his meditation state Lord J igten Sumgon became una~ ware of the passing of day and night. Once, when his eyes were bothering him, the King of the Nagas, Sokma Me, appeared before him and licked his eyes with his tongue, thus dispelling the disease. After three years J igten Sumgon returned to Phagdru Monastery and met Taklung Thangpa, with whom he entered into a dialogue on the profound teachings. He journeyed to several other places and then returned to Echung Cave where he meditated for two years. During that time he fell ill with leprosy. Sealing the cave and remaining within, he privately planned deliberately to transfer his consciousness. But sensing that others might believe he was hiding his sickness, he emerged from the cave and received auspicious signs. From there he went to the home of a patron and said, \"I have suddenly contracted a disease.\" He then returned to the cave and did prostrations before an image of Chenrezig which had been consecrated more than one hundred times by Lord Phagmodrupa. Whenever he felt deep depression, he remembered the sufferings of the six realms and a great natural compassion arose in his mind. A stream of tears flowed from his eyes, so he said prayers again and again that he might become the protector, help and refuge of all sen~ tient beings. During that time he noticed that whenever he meditated his sickness seemed to flow out from his legs like dust being carried away by a strong wind, or soft soil being raked by a plow, but whenever he ceased meditation, the sickness stagnated. At last one day in mid~winter there was suddenly mighty thunder and a rainfall, and the Lama could feel a change in his winds. Experiencing great joy, he observed the departure of an enormous Naga which had filled the whole of the valley. That evening he fully recovered, like the sun coming"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"DHARMA WRD JIGTEN SUMGON 243 out of eclipse. Doubting that the people could understand what was happening, he composed a song telling how within three nights and four days he was freed of all negative karma. In order to test whether these events were real, he found a leprosy patient and gave him the teachings. Within fifteen days the man fully recovered. After three days Lama Legpa arrived and recounted a dream in which he saw the sun surrounded by golden sylla, hies filling all of space. Lord Jigten Sumgon said, \"You have had a significant dream. 11 Thus, all obscurations were removed from him by the very root, and he was fully adorned with all the ornaments of the Buddha qualities. He realized the meaning of the outer, inner and secret interdependent aris, ings, and said, \"I realize the cause for the different kinds of birth, except for those of the sky dragon and the conch shell. 11 However, one day, due to the opening of the essential point in yogic exercises, he understood the birth of the dragon. Thus, he fully realized the truth of interdependent origination. Later he said, \"I meditated for seven years; for the first five I did not know how to meditate; during the next two I achieved the present great realizations. If I meditated yet a few years more, I could go to the Buddhafields and take all of you with me. 11 To serve the limitlessly compassionate Lama and the Tri, pie Gem, Lord Jigten Sumgon determined to benefit others unceasingly. Seven years previously a man had come to him, asking that he perform the upasaka vow ceremony, but he had declined. Regretting that he had not granted the man his wish, he asked him to return, whereupon he performed the rite. Since even the ants in his cave were moving north, he departed and went to the peak of a mountain where a huge thunderclap was heard just above his head. At the same time a thunderclap was heard from the North, so he took these as signs that his renown would pervade the entire earth. He thought about proceeding North and remaining on the moun, tain between nomads and city,dwellers. Then Lama Yal"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"244 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS came and requested that he perform rites for the anniversary of Lord Phagmodrupa's parinirvana. The first time he said, \"I made a promise to do meditation practice, not to perform rites. So for now I must simply meditate. 11 But the Lama became insistent, collecting a great amount of offerings for the ceremony, including meat and alcohol. During the rite Namka Gyen, the daughter of Lama Thopa Drupa, appeared naked and in dancing posture. At that moment Lord J igten Sumgon thought, \"Is it virtuous to perform this ritual or not? Perhaps this appearance is due to the fact that I am not a monk. In order to benefit sentient beings, I must take the monk's vows. Besides, I will thereby be fulfilling the wish of Lord Phagmodrupa. 11 So he took the monk's robes. From Phagmodru he went to Won in the company of the meditator Sherab Wophul. There he made offerings of a bolt of silk, a turquoise, and so forth, and along with other monks received the full ordination from Khenpo T selungpa. At that time he was thirty,five years of age. For the next two years he enjoyed the play of the different states of samadhi. From Khenpo T selungpa and other masters J igten Sumgon studied the root Vinaya text and the Pratimoksha Sutra, making mandala offerings and seven,fimbed prayers during each session, and realizing the inseparability of natural law and spiritual law. In Sangri, he meditated off and on in a hut for three months, attracting to that place about ten promi, nent Lamas, including Lama Sangriwa Drakkar. His renown extended far and wide. When Lama T sariwa engaged in a dialogue with him on the teachings, strong devotion arose in his mind. When others asked him how he found Lord J igten Sumgon, Lama Tsariwa replied, \"He is indeed like a Buddha. 11 After this the monks invited him to return to Phagdru Monastery where he showed Lama Shang the means of meditating on the prana. Although this Lama was unwell at the time, he was totally cured within fifteen days after receiving the teachings. It was at Lama Shang's request that J igten Sumgon composed the Praise to the Life of Phagmodrupa, which was the first text that he wrote. His attendants,"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"DHARMA LORD JIGTEN SUMOON 245 Gomshe and Palchen, requested that he stage a special blessing festival to bring about prosperity, so he placed flowers, tea and butter in an auspicious bag. Since that time the area has always been fruitful. One night Jigten Sumgon had a dream that Lord Phagmo-drupa had given him his own cushion. The next day all the monks gathered and made offerings, saying, \"This entire seat [monastery] is offered to you.\" That night Lord J igten Sumgon, accompanied by two other monks, departed the place and went to Tho. There many people made offerings and requested that he remain, but he did not accept. Naksho Khenpo and Dorje Gyaltsen came to see him, mentioning that there was a place called Drikung, close to the Ti-dro White Rock Mountain. At once, Lord J igten Sumgon felt he should go there for meditation practice. That night he had a dream that a local deity called Lha-pel, who wears a tiger skin and beats an enormous drum, came to visit him. On the way to Kyisho Gangbu, a dark and obscure place, he performed mudras which caused the sun to shine brightly. He also gave meditation instruction to deer and antelope. His ability to give teachings to the animals caused his fame to extend throughout the land. At Sangphu he bestowed the Bodhisattva's vow at the request of Lopon Jamseng and the other monks, who highly honored him. Instantly Palchenpo Choye, Gompa Sherab Yo, Naksho Khenpo, Phajo Dorje Gyaltsen, and Lama Sangriwa arrived. When Naksho Khenpo departed, Jigten Sumgon went with a retinue of four to Tselung. There, Nepo Monlam Senge said, \"Please take me to Drikung with you.\" Jigten Sumgon was pleased, and on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month they came to Chu-ngar. The following day they arrived in Drikung Thel, where the inhabitants of the plain gathered to welcome them. Lama Me-nyak told his disciples, \"On that rock there is a master who knows how to meditate, so you should go to him to receive instruction.\" About ten monks including Gompa Konchog Pagan Tharpa, Gompa Bhande and others invited him, highly honoring"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS him, and receiving the teachings. Thus, more than one hundred monks gathered around him, though he himself had only the intention to meditate. Gompa Konchog Gyaltsen, who acted as his patron, requested that he come to Kuthang, while Pon Marpa promised to make a clay image of Lord Phagmodrupa and offer it to him. But Lord Jigten Sumgon said, \"It is not right to make an image from clay, but only from precious metal.\" So Drum Ton from lower Do and Lopon Gyalwa made silver offerings for that purpose. Within three years monks who had finished their study came from Kyisho, made offerings of many texts, requested more instruction, and experienced the meditation. During this time Lord Jigten Sumgon was invited to Phatsen Nyar and Nyarpo. He wished to go to Mount Kailash, but as Jangchub Gyaltsen offered the monastery ofPunda, he stayed there for a one~month retreat. Appointing Palchen Dorje Yeshe as head of that monastery, he departed in the night with a retinue of four. When they arrived at the bottom of Drongbu Pass, they saw many blackbirds in flight. Lord Jigten Sumgon stopped and meditated there, then built a tho (rock stupa). Some bandits were approaching the other side of the pass above and Lord J igten Sumgon, knowing this, said, \"Robbers will come, but if they get beyond the pass, then I am not a yogin.\" Lord J igten Sumgon and his retinue changed their clothes so no one would recognize them and proceeded on their way. When they arrived at Droktse Pass, many people recog~ nized them and invited them to a place inhabited by nomads, where they were highly honored and respected. Then they went to Kyung Gom Monastery in Ko~Kyim where a large crowd gathered and performed a ceremony. Lord J igten Sumgon gave many teachings and made tea for the assembly. People coming from Drikung made offerings, and he gave them the vast and profound Dedication teachings. A rain~ bow appeared above his throne and all those assembled felt strong devotion. Though the winter days were short, the sun remained high in the heavens all the time he sat upon his"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"DHARMA LORD JIGTEN SUMGON 24 7 throne, but as soon as he descended night fell. Thus, every, one realized that he had the power to stay the sun. Many people afflicted with ailments were cured of their conditions. Lord Jigten Surngon next went to Drogkar. There Geshe T sangpa took teachings from him. Whatever offerings he received in those places he gave back to the community. Then he stayed at Treukyab where, in the evening, some thought they saw a herd of yaks corning, while others saw robbers, and yet others said the mountain was on fire, or that a great fire was issuing from the mouth of Thanglha [the Dharma guardian who inhabits the mountain]. All moved to Chule. In the morning, as they were partaking of food, some said they saw a temple, but others said, \"Since this is a barren plain, how can there be a temple? This must be a reception offered by Thanglha.\" Lord J igten Surngon took tea, placed his hat on his head, and set out for his journey. For an entire day a line of non,hurnans formed to receive him. Some were as large as mountains, some as long as rivers, and one opened a large parasol. All performed the three prostrations and circumambulated him anti,clockwise in the fashion of non,hurnans. Then they disappeared. That night a huge umbrella opened over Thanglha mountain. On the plain the flames of an immense fire were moved back and forth by the wind like a red flag. In the middle of the night it dissolved within the mountain. These all represented a wei, corning of Lord J igten Surngon by the Thanglha guardian, who was an eighth level Bodhisattva. This was seen by all but one of Lord Jigten Surngon's retinue of twenty,five. The Lama stayed at Theu,rang for one month, and there he received a vision of Ananda, who was as tall as a three,storied mansion. From him he received all the Buddha's teaching. At this time Lopon Gyalwa, Khenpo Koltiwa, Geshe Godul and many other great beings carne to him. He discussed the teachings with Lopon Gyalwa and the latter was fully satisfied. On the way, he saw the great Dharma protector, four,arrned Mahakala. Then he went to Thanglha and stayed"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS for eighteen days. He was invited by King Thang,de, T se,de and others, and so from late winter until early summer he stayed there. At this time he was thirty,nine years old. During the summer retreat he was surrounded by three hundred monks. One day, at the confession of faults (posadha) ritual, the monks arrived somewhat late. Lord Jigten Sum, gon said, \"From now on, we will no longer perform this ceremony.\" Immediately Brahma, the Lord of the World, came to him and requested that the ceremony be reinstated. The sun was encircled by a rainbow, which increased until it pervaded the whole of the sky. LordJigten Sumgon said, \"In like manner will my teaching pervade.\" He wished to meditate in a solitary place, but this would have taken him away from the monks. Yet, since the place was a kingdom, it would not attract many monks anyhow, so he determined to return to Drikung. Meanwhile, the Elder Lodro Zhonnu, Geshe Yorpo, and others requested that he come to the Phagdru seat. Thus, at their urging he returned and stayed in Drikung for two years, gathering many monks, including Khenpo Nagsho. Numbers of monks saw Lord J igten Sumgon manifest in many different forms. The contents of one large clay butter lamp lasted for the duration of an entire winter, neither increasing nor decreasing. Even the contents of the small butter lamps lasted five or six days. Some saw every corner of the Lama's retreat cave filled with barley. Gyalwa Gomchen saw the entire plain of Drikung filled with many manifesta, tions of the Lama. When some went to visit him, they could not see him. As for Lord J igten Sumgon himself, he had visions of Lord Gampopa, Marpa, Milarepa, the glorious Ga Lotsawa, and all the lineage Lamas, and engaged in many discussions with them over the profound teachings. The local guardian Barlha and many other non,humans came to him to receive the teachings, promising him that in the future they would protect the Dharma and practitioners. Once, Khenpo Koltiwa was giving ordinations to the monks without having cultivated Bodhicitta.

Henceforth, he performed it himself. Geshe Samyepa, Lama T sariwa and other great beings requested that the Lama come to the Phagdru seat. When he arrived, he subjugated eighty evil planetary spirits and offered one thousand loads of barley to the grassy hut that had been used by Lord Phagmodrupa. In addition, he offered a golden parasol to Phagmodrupa's stupa. Many practitioners were meditating in huts there at this time. In the autumn he returned to Drikung. Lama Nenang (Dusum Khyenpa) made offerings to him and showed him much respect. As well, sixty scholars skilled in four special branches of knowledge received him and daily made many offerings, such as eight sets of the vast Prajnaparamita text written in gold, horses, butter, and limitless other things. At this time one thousand monks were gathered in one place. Lord Jigten Sumgon sent the glorious Gomshe, On Gom, Ton Jung, Lopon Gyalwa, Lopon Ngephuwa, Jetsiin Lhepa and many others into retreat. At this time he was forty,nine years old. The Lama went to T sa,ouk and there revealed many holy places and caves where he left hand and foot prints. Later, it became a retreat place for many practitioners. He then summoned Palchen from T sari and, renouncing everything including his own hut, appointed him to take control of that area. Then he went to Ngam Sho to reconcile warring factions. Although he could not accomplish this easily, his blessing caused the fighting to cease for eighteen years. By his gift of wealth to Samye, the monastery was able to be restored. Lord J igten Sumgon next wished to go to India, and on the way stopped at Dagla Gampo Monastery where all the monks and people of the area received teachings. They made great offerings of riches, as well as of the monastery seat.

All the Nojins [wealth deities] brought necessi~ ties and wealth so that his hut was filled with offerings. When the Lama set out for India all the officials of the place vowed that if he left they would in turn go to Phagdru and fight. Feeling that they would carry out their threat, he returned to Phagdru. That summer the chief leaders such as Geshe Jamseng, Â· Palchen, Thagana, Geshe Gongkarwa, Lama Kalden and others gathered there, as well as the mountain dwellers. They built an enormous throne and made offerings of three hundred bolts of silk brocade. Lord Jigten Sumgon bestowed many profound teachings. One morning a line of Dakinis came toward him stretching from Oddiyana to his seat. He did a special meditation and manifested such auspi~ cious signs that instead of taking him away with them, they requested that he remain at Phagdru. People from Rongpo, Truk~Tsa, and Chaktsam came to the monastery and strongly requested that the Lama return to Drikung, which he agreed to do. There, in the presence of seven thousand monks, he gave many teachings. After a year he went to Thagey where he resolved the concerns of the people and established a discipline for their future guidance. As summer approached, the three plains of Drikung, Yagru and Bamthang were filled with disciples to whom he gave teachings. During that time he experienced certain negative signs, and Taklung Tangpa predicted, \"Obstacles may soon arise.\" In order to dispel these, the Lama announced that he would go into retreat for twelve years. He remained strictly secluded for five months during which Lama Nyakse went to Phagmodrupa and built a golden shrine. When he returned to Drikung he settled at Ta Chag Teng~ga (Place of the Galloping Horses), 1 and announced, \"After seven days Lord J igten Sumgon will emerge from his retreat.\" One week later Lord Jigten Sumgon said, \"All the negative signs have been reversed.\" For this reason he decided to emerge and appear in the assembly.

Toward this end he offered the Gya Bum text written in letters of gold, and paid him great respect. After a year, the Lama contemplated going to Tsari. When he sat on the Dharma throne at this time, some disciples saw him as Maha-Bodhi (Buddha Shakyamuni). When all were gathered together, he told them, \"Either you make a retreat in the mountains or I will.\" All the monks agreed to go on retreat. Those who had received the major teachings were sent to different caves and mountains, while eighty novice monks were entrusted to the care of Vajra Master Tisewa, who proceeded with them to Kyisho. That year Lord J igten Sumgon reached the age of fifty-six years and gathered many more disciples. He was invited to various monasteries where the people made myriad offerings. Returning to Drikung, he looked after an assembly of thir-teen thousand disciples. At this time he said, \"I have a special, profound teaching, so those of you who wish to receive it should prepare for a retreat.\" When eight hundred of the senior disciples gathered, he began the teachings which he offered for four months in preparation for their three-year retreat. He himself received teachings from celes-tial beings. When the Lama reached sixty years of age, many negative signs occurred, such as the crumbling of important holy places and the collapse of a dam. At the same time Lord Jigten Sumgon became ill with an imbalance of the water element in the body, and it appeared that he would die within three days. All the holy objects in the monastery were brought together and consecrated, and he did a special yogic exercise of the winds and channels. That night he was freed of all illness. Once, with the monk's bowl in hand and trident staff on his shoulder, he walked away from the monastery, paying homage to it all the while and saying, \"If I leave in this manner, the King of Garlog will honor me as his Lama, and"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"252 THE GREAT KAGYU MASTERS will offer me even Bodh'gaya if I ask it.\" At that time he manifested in India as as white~complexioned monk bearing a bowl and trident staff. When someone asked, \"Who are you?\" he replied, \"I am from Drikung.\" When they asked where he was going, he said, \"I am going to subdue the heretic army of Gar log.\" And when they asked how he intended to accomplish this, he said, \"I will subdue it with the samadhi of great loving kindness. Through that medita~ tion the place will be spontaneously subdued.\" And it came to pass as he predicted. Another time, when he was staying at Khangbu Meru, the Lama visited Dewachen in a dream, and was told by the Buddha Amitayus that he was the highest Bodhisattva, Yeshe Wangpo, the chief of the gathering. All those in the vicinity of Khangbu Meru recognized him as the reincarna~ tion of King Tri Ralpachen [the eighth~century King of Tibet who translated many of the Buddha's teachings into Tibetan, built monasteries, and obtained the support of seven families for each monk]. Lordjigten Sumgon's patrons were similar, his attendants resembled the king's ministers, and his disci~ ples were like the king's subjects. All his activities had the power vf a king's activities, though they emanated from the spiritual domain. When he was asked if he were indeed the reincarnation of the King, he did not deny it. Once, when jetsun Lhapa (Nyo Gyalwa Lhanangpa) made numerous offerings to all the monks during the giving of the special teachings, thirty thousand disciples gathered. At this time Pandita Shakyashri was in Tibet, and though Lord Jigten Sumgon did not meet him, he honored him and they had much communication. By now the Lama was sixty~six years of age. He offered Dharma texts to Dagla Gampo Monastery from Phagmodru because he knew that this was Lord Phagmodrupa's wish. As the true seat of the Lama is the two Bodhicittas, where there is Bodhicitta there is the seat of Phagmodrupa. So Lord J igten Sumgon taught all his disciples to hold and cherish the two Bodhicittas, which is the greatest service"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"DHARMA LORD JIGTEN SUMGON 253 one can perform for the Lama. Indeed, it is greater than the twelve hardships endured by Naropa. For this reason Lord Jigten Sumgon personally cared for all the monks-even the young novices sleeping in the dust-as if they were his own heart, seeing them as inseparable from Phagmodrupa. One day, Heruka appeared in the sky, holding a bow and arrow, which he shot at LordJigten Sumgon's heart. At that moment the full meaning of the secret mantra was completely revealed to him. Besides the retreat practitioners assembled on the plain, Lord J igten Sumgon gathered fifty~five thousand, five hun~ dred twenty~five disciples. And this is only a superficial account. In detail I carinot tell the full extent of even one day of the Lama's activities. He gave teachings for forty years during which many of his disciples became monks. In the first six months twenty~five disciples became monks, and with the passing of each year the number grew at the rate of one thousand, ten thousand, and one hundred thousand. As offerings Lord Jigten Sumgon received one hundred thou~ sand volumes of texts written in gold, along with horses, yaks, dzos, tea, silk, gold, silver, barley and jewels-in all, hundreds of thousands of articles. When the Lama was in his seventies, one hundred eighty thousand disciples gathered in Drikung. Many were sent into retreat on Mount Kailash, Lachi Snow Mountain, T sari, and other holy places. In brief, the entire earth was pervaded with his human and non~human disciples. The life story of the Dharma Lord Cannot be expressed, Because the Buddha's activities Are without end.

The Lama gave the teaching on cause and effect, Related to the Buddha's words On interdependent arising. He never used psychic power, Nor fought the seat. He compassionately asked advice from his enemies. All the offerings Of material goods and so forth He used for the support of the practitioners Rather than for monasteries, temples, and images.

He was the father of a thousand and one princes. While practicing one night, He achieved Buddhahood, the heart of enlightenment, And became the Lord, the King of all Buddhas, Whose name was Lurik Dronma. After that, he saw that it was time to tame (those princes).1 To the entire gathering of his sons he gave extensive teach, ings on death, impermanence, the cause and effect of karma, and the faults of samsara according to the Four Noble Truths. A thousand of those sons gradually became monks, and they perfectly kept the morality of renunciation.

They then benefitted all the sentient beings of the immeas, urable, boundless, endless, limitless realms of the universe. The youngest prince, because he was attached to the king, dom and his queen, could not become a monk. Although he had gone a little against his father's wishes, because of his nobility and in order to confess his faults he made a thousand and one great and marvelous parasols of the finest gold from the Dzambu River, with pleats of the finest vaidurya, adorned with various jewels, and with handles of precious ruby.

They are benefitting beings in all the limitless realms of the universe.\" Again, the precious lama said: \"The body of the previous noble Acharya (Nagarjuna) is not my body now, But the Dharma that he taught is present in my mind.\" Because he said this, he is definitely also the noble, great Acharya.

Therefore, if one doesn't know how to practice, Though he may boast that he has practiced the holy Dharma, He will be near the edge of a great, unseen precipice.
