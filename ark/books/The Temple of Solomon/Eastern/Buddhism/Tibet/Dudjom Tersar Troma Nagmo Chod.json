[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TROMA This heart essence of Padmasambhava, the actual Palchen Heruka, from the transmission of Sarahapa, forebearer of siddhis, contained in the expanse of the treasury of the space of the dharmata, was unsealed by Drogben's emanation, Dudjom Lingpa, through the spontaneous manifestation of awareness. This quintessence of the revelation of the great inexhaustible heart treasure is of exalted and wondrous blessing. Translated from the text"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Introduction Having placed on my head the feet of many holy lamas of perfect lineage, and having been ripened by their nectar drops of direct transmission, I, Chagdud Tulku, requested Sarah Harding, an experienced yogini, accomplished retreatant, and competent translator, to bring this heart treasure from Tibetan language into English. Every treasure is revealed in its own time and this is the time for Dudjom's treasures. Through the practice of Troma, thirteen yogis have attained rainbow body. Its blessing is truly swift and amazing. The translation herein is of one branch of this supreme practice. I have heard and practiced many teachings with some degree of accomplishment, and this translation has been done very carefully. Yet, any limits of the ordinary mind become apparent in the face of words as profound as the ocean and meaning as vast as the sky. I accept responsibility for any mistakes. The merit in the intention and accomplishment of this work is now dedicated -To the lineage masters of our time. May their lives be long and may the sacred doctrine be increased by their ~xistence. -To those persons whose excellent efforts have produced this text so that practitioners can move swiftly beyond the shallow currents of talk and concepts, into the profound depths of essential dharma. May their obstacles dissolve and may they gain full realization of the vajra yogini, Black Troma. -To all sentient beings. May they be liberated from the demoniacal grip of hope and fear, and gain complete access to the sky treasury of dharmata.
