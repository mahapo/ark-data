Foreword to the Second EditionIstrongly suggestthat whoever wants to read this book and practiceChöd have the initiation from a qualified teacher and have their permissionto study this book. Because this practice is of the high tantric class ofVajrayana, it may be dangerous rather than beneficial to do this practice with-out initiation and explanation from a qualified teacher.The commentary on the Chöd text was written by Jamgön Kongtrül LodöTaye, the Great One. First I gave a class on this text and commentary for theKagyü Droden Künchab students who practice Chöd, and then I thought itwould be a good time to have an English translation in print for students toread directly.The first edition of this book was completed in 1994 with the able assistanceof my students, especially Donga Paul Seaton, Ron Garry, and Alexis Kostich,who contributed their expertise in a number of areas from typesettingthrough editing and proofreading. I am grateful to them all for their help. Inparticular, Alexis created the drawings, based upon my oral instructions, of allthe different stages of visualization for this commentary. It was not just myeffort but her devotion and diligence that have made this book possible, so Iwish to thank her.The line drawings of Dampa Sangye and Six-Armed Mahakala are courtesyof the well-known Tibetan thangka painter Gega Lama.The second edition contains a letter from Kyabje Bokar Rinpoche that wasintended for inclusion in the first edition, but which arrived after the first edi-tion went to press. With the blessing of this great teacher, who is well knownin the West, may the teachings flourish and benefit all sentient beings.This new edition also contains the Chöd sadhana [daily practice text], whichChod_Interior 6/30/09 11:50 AM Page 9"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"was composed by the Fourteenth Karmapa, in three versions: Tibetan, pho-netic rendering of the Tibetan, and the English translation. This was intendedfor the practitioner to have easy access to both the commentary and the sadh -ana. Lama Gyeltsen [Jay Eilertson], who is my longtime disciple, has com-pleted a three-year retreat under me. He has practiced Chöd and has lots ofbackground, so I have asked him to check the translation and make correctionsto the grammar. He has assisted me in reviewing the translation as well. Inaddition to that, he has done collating and reordering. I would like to give himthanks for helping me. Craig Janke and Alexis Kostich provided invaluableassistance by modifying the illustrations for the stages of visualizationdescribed within the commentary. Lama Sherab [Don Iocca] is also my disci-ple, and he has also undertaken the three-year retreat. He also helped correctthe Tibetan, and he has assisted me with some of the Tibetan corrections. So,I would like to thank him for his generosity as well. I would also like to thankCone Beckham, Deborah Janke, Kris Burson, and Maude Honemann for theirhelp in proofreading.

Life of Machig LabdrönOral Biography by Very Ven. Lama Lodö RinpocheThe especially well-known, profound practice of Chöd was broughtfrom India to Tibet by the great mahasiddha Dampa Sangye. This teach-ing flourished through the great wisdom dakini Machig Labkyi Drönma by thedepth of her realization and compassion. Specifically, the Chöd teachings andpractice were transmitted in Tibet by Machig Labdrön, who thus played a veryimportant role in the Chöd lineage. Here, therefore, we will give a brief his-tory of the wisdom dakini Machig Labdrön.First, she manifested from Dharmata in the form of Prajñaparamita. Fromthat, she emanated as the great pandit and mahasiddha Döndrub Zangpo inIndia. He was a very well-known scholar and accomplished yogi. At that time,he received many prophecies from divine beings and his own teacher that hemust go to Tibet to benefit many beings in the snowy regions. He quicklyaccomplished complete realization in the cave of Potari, and while he waspracticing and experiencing clear realization, a dakini appeared and told himhe needed to go to Tibet to benefit many beings in the snowy regions, andmust transmute his consciousness into her heart.As the dakini requested, he transmuted his consciousness into her heart andtook birth in Tibet in the town of Labchi Kangra as the daughter of a couplewho had great devotion to the Dharma. Her father and mother, Chökyi Dawaand Bumcham, were patrons of the Buddhadharma and lords of that town.After entering her mother’s womb, during the pregnancy many special anddivine signs appeared, such as her reciting the Mani and Ga-Te and other dif-ferent mantras and even speaking to her mother from the womb. All theseunusual indications were heard by the mother. During the pregnancy theChod_Interior 6/30/09 11:50 AM Page 11"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"mother had many omens, dreams, and blissful and joyful experiences. Manyneighbors and villagers also had incredibly unusual omens, dreams, and expe-riences.Machig was born without any kind of difficulty to the mother and immedi-ately stood in a mass of rainbow light and manifested many divine signs, suchas a third eye and being able to speak right away to her mother. Her wisdom and compassion naturally caused people to be devoted to heras an emanation of Buddha and to bow, pray, and receive blessing from herwithout any doubt.She followed her mother in her daily practice in the shrine room, reciting,bowing, and saying prayers, expressing devotion at an early age. She alsoshowed unimaginable intelligence in reading, matched by no other; even herown teacher could not equal her intelligence.Her special ability and unusual qualities became known throughout thekingdom; even the king heard of her, and extended an invitation to her and herfamily to meet with him. He offered them gifts and prayers, and gave her thename of “Labdrön,” as the one born in the village of Labchi Kangra and alreadycalled Drönma by her mother.She was an extremely fast reader and mastered all aspects of Buddhist sci-ence, including logic, etc., without effort. When she was thirteen her motherdied; afterward she followed her sister as a disciple of Lama Drapa Ngönsheand stayed for four years with him, learning the teachings and practice of thesutra and tantra traditions, and reading the sutras for that lama.Afterward she met Kyotön Sönam Lama, who bestowed on her the em -powerments of all traditions. She received teachings, and both Lama DrapaNgönshe and Kyotön Sönam Lama foretold that she must unite with theIndian mahasiddha Sangye Tönpa, who had come to Tibet to benefit sentientbeings; that she had the karma to unite method and wisdom and benefitbeings with him.She met and practiced tantric union with the great mahasiddha [SangyeTönpa] and again returned to her two gurus, telling them what she had doneand requesting more teaching. Finally they sent her back to the yogi to con-tinue with him, even saying that to start a family lineage with him wouldgreatly benefit sentient beings. So she followed her gurus’ instructions, went12 : chöd practice manual and commentaryChod_Interior 6/30/09 11:50 AM Page 12"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"back to him, and had two sons and a daughter. After having the daughter, shecompletely renounced worldly life and practiced in isolated places. After that,she met Dampa Sangye and requested all the teachings directly from him. Heforetold that she would greatly benefit beings and should go practice at themountain of Zangri Kamar; that many disciples would be gathered there, andthat it would greatly benefit sentient beings.According to her gurus’ instructions, she meditated there and began toteach many beings—humans, nonhumans, spirits, and nagas. She composedher own tradition, Pungpo Sengyurma, “Offering the Body as Food forDemons.” She developed this and taught it to many beings; then her traditionflourished all over Tibet. She had many disciples; abbots, learned pandits, andmany yogis and yoginis became her students.Her doctrine of Pungpo Sengyurma became popular all over Tibet, andrumor of it even spread to India. Then pandits and mahasiddhas were sent toverify that an emanation of Prajñaparamita had appeared in human form, haddeveloped a specific tradition, and was benefiting beings. Two accomplishedsiddhas, both pandits and great beings, were sent to Tibet to meet Machig,question her, and check her teachings. When they first spoke to her, Machigreplied in the Indian tongue. They asked her how she learned the language, andshe replied that she had no need to learn it; she had been born in India beforeher present birth in Tibet, and had never forgotten it. This impressed the twopandits; here was a great being who could change lives and yet not forget thelanguage.They stayed and debated with her for many days concerning the Hinayana,Mahayana, and Vajrayana points of view. The two great scholars could notdefeat her; she won the debate, and her teaching became popular not only inTibet but in Nepal and India as well. While the teachings of the Buddha hadbeen faithfully carried from India to Tibet and elsewhere, never before had anytradition been transmitted from Tibet to India. Machig’s Chöd of Mahamudratransmission was the first time in history that a valid source of Dharma wentfrom Tibet to India. Thus, such a great being, Machig Labdrön, was the firstlineage holder, and this unbroken lineage continues until the present guru, asshown on the following pages.life of machig labdrön : 13Chod_Interior 6/30/09 11:50 AM Page 13"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Dampa Sangye by Gega LamaChod_Interior 6/30/09 11:50 AM Page 14"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"?

Known as the “reversal of Chöd,”it is a very frightful mistake on this path. From the start, one’s mind should bepointed in an unmistaken direction.Among a great many well-known [Chöd] traditions of the Old and NewSchools, the Surmang tradition is respected for its descended word3and isespecially superior because of its profound and extensive oral instructions,undiminished continuity, confidence due to realization and familiarity,4anduninterrupted blessing of speech.The visualization concerning the feast offering, etc. in this tradition may beclarified elsewhere.During the daily practice of giving the body, the preliminary practiceincludes five sections: generating bodhi mind, taking refuge, gathering theaccumulations, clearing away obscurations, and making offerings.The actual practice consists of five sections: the transference of conscious-ness (phowa), body mandala, the three cycles of white feasts condensed intoone, the red feasts condensed into one, and the ganachakra[i.e., feast offering].The concluding stage of practice consists of three sections: dedicationprayers, the dissolving stage, and carrying on the path. Altogether this Chödpractice is roughly complete in thirteen divisions.Preliminary Stage of PracticeGenerating Bodhicitta (Enlightened Mind)?J3?- *J.,(sem kye)So, at this time, first generate mind5toward substantial torturing enemies;formless harmful obstructors; ones who cause interference by acting contraryto [one’s] wishes; karmic obstructors, who are the four demons6born ofcoemergent ignorance; the demon Lord of Death, who snatches the source of36 : chöd practice manual and commentary3bKa’ bab: Oral instructions and commitments passed down from lama to student in the lineage.4 Realization obtained through Chöd practice and particular familiarity with it—a special empha-sis in the Surmang lineage.5 Generate bodhicitta.6Chöd tradition:Demon of Unimpededness (Thogs bcas kyi bdud); Demon of Impededness (Thogs medkyi bdud); Demon of Aggrandizement (dGa’ spro’i bdud); Demon of Ego-Clinging (sNyems byed kyibdud).

Abide in the wis-dom view which is the uncontrived, primordial Mahamudra.This is the gross [level] set of preliminary, actual, and conclusion [practices]solely concerning the giving of the body.In general, the preliminaries in regard to the genuine Holy Dharma con-cerned with cutting off the object—demons42— are: arousing the certainty ofsamsara; driving impermanence into the heart; being assured of the infallibil-ity of karmic cause and effect; [and, thinking of] the lack of leisure, turning themind toward the short [term].

If not abiding bythat, focus the mind on a golden dorje the size of a grain of barley—the essenceof Prajñaparamita—in front of oneself. If not abiding even by that, focus themind on the body of Shakyamuni. By fixing sinking and excitement if theyarise, faultless samadhi will be born in one’s mindstream.By the cognition of looking inward, the essence of these three—the mover78 : chöd practice manual and commentary42 The object to be cut off and destroyed is the ego, which manifests as the four demons.43 If the preliminary and concluding parts of the practice are rightly understood and performed,then the main practice will automatically bring true realization.Chod_Interior 6/30/09 11:50 AM Page 78"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"and abider; the appearance of object and concept; and the mover and one whois aware—is not established as separate. It is without identity, yet able to giverise to anything. The unimpeded experience of clarity and emptiness isbeyond speech and expression, absent of all fabrication, and has the characterof the sky; that is Prajñaparamita. This is the wisdom of the Victorious Onesof the three times; do not ever move from this samadhi.Secondly, to cut the four demons into space:If one relies on external substantiality—form, etc.—which is “impeded-ness,” and toward that discursive thoughts of attachment and aversion arise,that is “demon.” If one falls under the sway of this, it is called “interference.”So, whenever desire, anger, or resisting and accepting arise, at that instant say“PHAT!” and take [the mind] into space.

Thisis called the “demon of unimpededness.”Clinging to oneself as good and having pride and conceit about signs of thepath, etc. is the “demon of aggrandizement.”The ever-grasping self-clinging is the “demon of ego-clinging.”Do not spoil the freshness of mindfulness [with these demons].

It is necessary to cut [it] on that veryseat, in a desolate place, but many cannot. It is a crucial point not to move thebody, not speak, not be under the sway of whatever arises in the mind, and by“PHAT,” to take the mind into space.Understand that it is necessary to cut evil discursive thought of the threetimes, etc. into space. However, bound by the knot of clinging to the idea ofgoodness, very many fall from deities into demons. If even yearning and devo-tion, compassion, the development stage with characteristics, the completionstage, etc. are taken into space by “PHAT,” having increased the above virtues,one comes very close to the excellent siddhi.In short, the root of Chöd is not having hope and doubt. If under the swayof other discursive thought, then one is bound by the four demons. The mean-ing of Prajñaparamita is to cut into space.
