it was ourhope that in this academic series we could cover the widest possi-ble range of high quality but accessible academic work on Tibet andthe Tibetan Himalayas. The aim is not just to include academicmonographs, edited volumes, works of reference and reprints ofimportant works, but also to make available research materials of amore original, controversial and occasionally also preliminary naturethat hold great potential of generating further discussion and research.Many Tibet scholars are already aware of John Vincent Bellezza’sbroad and detailed archaeological surveys of the Tibetan plateau1and his earlier work on pairs of sacred mountains and lakes in theByang thang area.2Based on those publications most will no doubtagree that it will be difficult to find a scholar better introduced tothe material culture, myth and folklore of North-western Tibet.Therefore we are very pleased to include in BTSL Bellezza’s mostrecent scholarly work, Spirit-mediums, Sacred Mountains and Related BonTextual Traditions in Upper Tibet, which, as the title indicates, exam-ines the ubiquitous phenomenon of spirit mediums in these upperregions of North-western Tibet that Bellezza knows so intimately.The book’s underlying thesis is one that forms a Leitmotivin mostof Bellezza’s work. It is the assumption of continuities in present-day local religious practices and lore—in this case of spirit medi-ums—with earlier strata of culture, which are variously qualified bythe author as “indigenous Tibetan” and “pre-Buddhist”. Followinggeneral perception, Bellezza identifies Bon as a privileged carrier ofarchaic indigenous relics into present-day culture. It is a thesis thathas frequently been voiced in Tibetan studies, but its substantiation,due to a lack of data (and particularly the reliable dating thereof ),1Antiquities of Northern Tibet, Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Sites on the High Plateau (Findingsof the Changthang Circuit Expedition, 1999), Delhi 2001, and Antiquities of Upper Tibet,Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Sites on the High Plateau (Findings of the Upper Tibet CircumnavigationExpedition, 2000), Delhi 2002.2Divine Dyads, Ancient Civilization in Tibet, Dharamsala 1997."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xiiforewordin tantalising ways has managed to remain out of reach. And eventhough at this point our state of knowledge may still preclude adefinite judgement on the precise nature and extent of those appar-ent continuities, Bellezza, while aware of these limitations—particu-larly of the sketchy chronological framework—here nonetheless presentsthe best case possible for a survival of ‘indigenous Tibetan culture’in the phenomena studied, and in the process he provides us witha veritable treasure trove of data. Based on Bellezza’s detailed argu-ments, the reader will be able to draw his own conclusions. Whilesome will feel inclined to follow his working hypotheses, others mayremain unconvinced or may even prefer to draw other conclusions.Herein resides a great asset of the present study. Beyond its the-ses and their detailed argumentation, its descriptive and analyticaldetail provides a vast compendium, previously almost entirely unknown,of ethnographic, ‘material’, textual and oral data. Since the authorclearly identifies his position, because of this scholarly integrity, heis able to facilitate the reader who feels so inclined to attempt hisown investigation, inquiry, and conclusions, based on the data pro-vided. In other words, the research materials will be of considerableand lasting value, whether one feels inclined to agree with the author’spoint of departure and conclusions or not; or, if I may be permit-ted to phrase that in the author’s own words: “I have elected tominimise theoretical design in favour of descriptive analysis for thesimple reason that I see the process of chronicling all-important atthis juncture in Tibetan history. I am therefore, applying much ofmy energy to the careful documentation of cultural and archaeo-logical materials in the field”.Bellezza provides much evidence for the Buddhist appropriationof lore surrounding spirit mediums in upper Tibet, implicitly pre-supposing non-Buddhist strata that, over a long period and no doubtin various ways, were affected by the influx and establishment ofBuddhist culture in Tibet. When constructing his argument in thisway, Bellezza at the same time opens it up to further inquiry (byothers) into the possibility of invention or redefinition of ‘indigenousculture’, particularly in its supposedly privileged relation to Bon.Indeed, the data provided may not only allow positing a Buddhistappropriation of the phenomena described but also appropriation byBonpos, and per sedo not force us to prioritize one tradition as(closer to) an archaic stratum that the other transforms. Much willof course depend on one’s frame of reference."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"forewordxiiiAs is well known, in this context supporting evidence from theearliest sources (Dunhuang) is fragile, usually unspecific, fragmentaryand ambiguous, occasionally heavily dependent on interpretation;indeed, the preponderant and at the same time most pregnant andeloquent literary evidence for ‘an indigenous past’ in fact turns outto be remarkably late; while oral data in this context must remainof uncertain date. Adducing later literary evidence of course invitesquestions regarding the precise (timeframe and context of ) forma-tion and provenance of these sources, which in turn may reflect onthe perceived nature of the investigated phenomena. When queried,literary sources may reveal as much (if not more) about the timeand context in which they have developed as (than) they may revealabout the ‘early indigenous culture’ that they are presumed to referto or thought to have preserved relics of.These are crucial questions that remain to be answered—andpartly also asked—in future research projects. Possibly forthcominganswers will doubtlessly lead to fresh questioning on these lines. Aclose examination of the phenomena studied and the data adducedfor their further elucidation, with a particular focus on their forma-tion as datable cultural artefacts and on the architecture of theirmeta-narratives, may reveal a great deal about the dialogic natureof the formation of Bon and Buddhist traditions in the area andperhaps also result in a new understanding of the perceived refer-ences to ‘indigenous Tibetan culture’ or the appropriation thereof.I should like to stress that it is not my main intention here tohighlight alternate approaches and future tasks as such, but to expli-cate the sincere appreciation that ilk considerations—and there maybe many others—would not have been possible at this point, hadBellezza not facilitated them by gathering his data and aligning themin a transparent way with his theses.Wherever future research in this area may take us, I am con-vinced that Bellezza’s book will be read with great and lasting schol-arly interest and I should also like to express the sincere wish, nodoubt also on behalf of the author, that this study may for longengender the scholarly discussion that has proven so vital to the con-struction of academic knowledge. I should like to conclude by com-plementing the author with this truly impressive achievement.Henk BlezerCNWS, Leiden 2005"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSFirstly, I want to heartily thank His Holiness sMan-ri’i khri ’dzin(Menri Trizin), Slob-dpon bsTan ’dzin rnam-dag (Lopon TenzinNamdak), Slob-dpon bsTan-pa g.yung-drung (Lopon Tenpa Yung-drung), and g.Yung-drung bstan ’dzin (Yungdrung Tenzin) for theirgenerous technical assistance.

They are the vehicles of the gods, the spirit-medi-ums for the ancestral and protective deities. Still today, in perilousrites of possession, the spirit-mediums claim to call down the godswhile purging their own egos, and in thought, word and deed becomethe very embodiment of these supernatural beings. Their revelationsare believed to vitally join the divinities and society together in apact of mutual benefit and understanding, which has left a lastingmark on the religions of Tibet. This primeval impulse, of peoplebecoming gods, is one of the pillars on which the Tibetan systemof religious beliefs and rituals was founded.This work examines the spirit-mediums that hail from the vastupper regions of northwest Tibet.1The spirit-mediums of UpperTibet, both men and women, serve as the incarnate form of theregion’s chief mountain gods, as well as a range of other divinities.It is believed that when the consciousness of these deities enters thespirit-mediums the latter act and speak on their behalf. It is com-monly held in Upper Tibet, that under the possession of the gods,the spirit-mediums heal sick people and livestock, exorcise evil spir-its, bring good fortune to those struck by bad luck, and predict theoutcome of future events. Local inhabitants have sought their ser-vices for centuries, and some spirit-mediums have taken up theirvocation on the Subcontinent, in exile.This work demonstrates that the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibetare locally important religious and medical practitioners with a longlegacy of tradition behind them. The significance of the spirit-mediums therefore lies not only in the richness of their practice and1This Upper Tibet territory comprises the overlapping areas known as sTod andByang-thang. These areas now constitute the prefecture of mNga’ ris, and parts ofthe Nag-chu, Lhasa and gZhis-ka-rtse prefectures of the Tibet Autonomous Region."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"2part onethe many curiosities associated with it, but in the historical depthsit discloses. Of all the traditional professions still surviving in UpperTibet spirit-mediumship is the one that best exemplifies the remain-ing non-Buddhist culture of the region. In the course of this studyof spirit-mediums we will open a window onto the vista of UpperTibetan culture, revealing a multidimensional inheritance that hasindelibly imprinted Tibet’s Buddhism. Over the centuries, these nativeand Buddhist aspects of local culture have merged to form the tra-dition of spirit-mediumship now found in the region.The non-Buddhist and primarily indigenous heritage of UpperTibet reflects patterns of belief, ritual and tradition that developedprior to or independent of the Buddhist cultural patrimony. As thiswork will repeatedly make evident, according to views widely heldin the Bon religion, the antecedents of this heritage extend far intothe past. In the Bon view, the spirit-mediums divulge a traditionalmode of living expression at variance with the Indian Buddhism thathas so come to dominate Tibet. In other words, the spirit-mediumsare vibrant testimony to an alternative or Bon paradigm of Tibetanculture, one that is conceived of as being anchored in the pre-Imperialhistory of the Plateau. While pre-Imperial origins for this culturalphenomenon cannot be adduced with the ethnographic and textualmaterials at our disposal, it is clear that many aspects of spirit-mediumship reflect an indigenous orientation. That is to say, thedeities they call down are wedded to the Upper Tibetan landscape,flora and fauna, and their costumes and rituals exploit local produceand products.I have chosen to designate those who act as human vessels forthe deities ‘spirit-mediums’ because this term most accurately sumsup their central activity: the ability to embody or be mediums fora host of different spirits. According to the testimonies of the spirit-mediums, this mediumship occurs at the flight of their normal con-sciousness and personality, and subsequent colonization of their mindand body by the summoned host deity. This mediumistic functionis the basis of their profession and serves to distinguish them fromother types of Tibetan religious practitioners. I have avoided the useof the term ‘shaman’, which is sometimes employed to describe sim-ilar religious functionaries in various cultures, because of its uncrit-ical usage in popular parlance. This term is also used in scholarlyliterature to describe highly disparate cultural phenomena worldwide,thus its signification has become modifiable in accordance with the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"general orientation3needs at hand. When the spirit-mediums perform divination or makeutterances about the future they could also correctly be described asoracles, but this term does not convey their more important cura-tive and restorative functions.Drawing upon a wide range of ethnographic and textual materi-als to investigate the phenomenon of spirit-mediumship in UpperTibet, this work analyses the way in which its mythic, historical andpresent day characteristics are interrelated. The alleged continuity ofthis tradition over many centuries, and the way in which this is sup-posed to have been fostered, is the underlying theme that gives thisbook its narrative and analytical coherence.This is a Tibetological work that focuses on the culture and tra-ditions of the spirit-mediums and is therefore based primarily onTibetan textual and oral sources. I have ultilized a diachronic per-spective based on a comparison of the legendary and contemporarycomponents of the tradition of spirit-mediumship. These past andpresent-day facets are enshrined in both the oral and literary tradi-tions. This work therefore is modeled upon an ethnohistory, how-ever, the data at my disposal does not permit the vigorous applicationof the methodologies relied upon by this discipline. The historicallyambiguous nature of many of the materials presented means that acorroboratory chronology to serve as a benchmark for ethnohistor-ical discourse is largely lacking. As such, this work might be bestdescribed as a legendary history of spirit-mediumship in Upper Tibet,one that is derived from the relevant corpus of written documentsand oral traditions.From the few extant literary sources, we will examine the fabu-lous origins of the spirit-medium profession. This work also includesa general study of texts that elucidate the deities, ritual practices andceremonial equipment of the spirit-mediums. I have elected to basemost of my research on Bon texts because it is this religion thatsquarely claims the tradition of spirit-mediumship (lha-bzhugs) as itsown. According to Bon tradition, Bon spirit-mediums were active inpre-Imperial times (what is also generally referred to as the pre-Buddhist period) prior to 630 CE. Other reasons why the Bon lit-erary tradition is most applicable to this field of study is because byits own reckoning its ancient religious heartland was Upper Tibet,the region known as Zhang-zhung. Moreover, according to the Bon-po, many of the deities resorted to by the spirit-mediums were partof the archaic native tradition of this region. The Bon literary record"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"4part onetherefore, is uniquely suited as a heuristic tool to uncover the breadthand significance of the tradition of spirit-mediumship.The deities and implements used by the spirit-mediums, and therites and rituals that take place in their trance ceremonies, will bedescribed in detail. This exposition is based on two major elements:1) an elaboration of how the oral and literary traditions inform oneanother in the area of indigenous religious tradition; and 2) a por-trayal of the pre-Imperial pedigree of spirit-medium culture in Bonhistorico-ritual notions (narratives presented as having a historicalbasis in Bon ritual literature). This work will also pay close atten-tion to the vocational lineages (lha-rgyud) and the spirit-mediums’ per-ceptions of what constitutes possession.As this work is ethnographic and philological (the study and inter-pretation of literary texts) in nature, areas such as anthropologicalmusings, social theory and ethno-psychiatry do not play a part. Asvalid as these alternative disciplines are to understanding the phe-nomenon of spirit-mediumship, especially as interpretive tools, theywill have to await further inquiry. By compiling a descriptive workon the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet, I hope to facilitate futurestudy into the many curious matters that fall outside the ambit ofthis book. Subjects for further research include, among others, ques-tions concerning the physiology of the trance state, the epistemologyof possession, and the medical basis of the healing instrumentalitiesexploited by the spirit-mediums.In Upper Tibet, male spirit-mediums are commonly referred toaslha-pa(god-carrier/god-man),dpa’ bo(hero, also an epithet of sacredmountains), and lha ’beb-mkhan/lha-babs-mkhan(god-descending-one).Female mediums are calleddpa’ mo(heroine),lha-mo(god-woman)andklu-mo(water-serpent-woman). In this work, I have elected toapply the term lha-paas the equivalent of a male spirit-medium (orsimply medium) because it most appropriately describes the coreactivity of the profession; the embodiment of the deity. The eminentTibetanist R.A. Stein (1972: 188) described thelha-paandklu-pa(male mediums for the water spirits) as shepherds who serve as recep-tacles for local deities, which succinctly characterizes the practice inUpper Tibet.In eastern Tibet, other terms for analogous spirit-mediums includelha-kha(god-mouth),lha ’dzin(god-possessed),lha-zhon(god-ridden),while’dre ’dzinrefers to those afflicted by demonic possession—char-acterized by unwanted seizures, convulsions and super normal strength"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"general orientation5(Ekvall 1964: 273). In festivals renewing the annual link between thephywamountain deities and communities in Bhutan and rTa-dbang,men from the most influential families, called lha-mi(god-men), embodythese deities (Pommaret 1996: 52).Lha-pa, the mouthpieces of the gods, are most often dependedupon for healing and divination (cf. Ekvall 1964: 27, 273). Theirperceived ability to effectively arbitrate between the gods and com-munity seems to explain their persistence over time. Their wide-spread, integrated presence in the pastoral communities of UpperTibet is best seen as reflecting the long-term success of the lha-pa.They are attributed with providing essential remedial services, heal-ing the physically and mentally ill, and giving guidance to thoseembarking on long trips and new business ventures. Moreover, theyprovide these services in a rather egalitarian manner where the remu-neration received in goods or services is dependent on the inclina-tion and financial means of the patient or client. In other words,there are not fixed rates for their exertions, permitting people of allsocioeconomic rungs to avail themselves of their services. This util-itarian factor helps to explain their continued survival in Upper Tibetdespite 50 years of Communism, which views such reliance on deitiesas superstitious and anti-modern. Aside from practicing as spirit-mediums, the lha-paare engaged in animal husbandry and trade likeother herders. This is an indication that they only receive a sup-plemental income from their specialized religious activities.2Under-developed and politically neglected pre-Communist UpperTibet was a particularly conducive environment for the spirit-mediums,and every district had at least one or two of them. There were rel-atively few monasteries in Upper Tibet and these could be locatedscores of miles from the settlements of the herders, thus vital assis-tance from the clergy was not always available. Likewise, there werenot enough professional medical practitioners (Em-chi/sman-pa) to caterto the health needs of the population. The lha-pa’sservices thereforeacted as a substitute to those of the lamas and doctors. In some2It is not known whether the altruistic fashion in which services are offered bythe contemporary spirit-mediums was always the norm. In earlier times, when thelha-pawere endowed with far more prestige and power, more socially exploitativetransactions may also have prevailed. It is reported that the fees of many of thehigh-statussku-rten(oracle-priests) of central Tibet, in the pre-Communist periodwere very considerable for ordinary people (Nebesky Wojkowitz 1956: 455)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6part onecases, however, so highly respected were the lha-pathat they wereactively sought out as an alternative to other types of religious andmedical practitioners. They had the unique advantage of being cul-turally invested with the legitimacy of acting and speaking on behalfof the deities. As the gods came alive through them, they repre-sented one of the most tangible and immediate forms of religioustradition in Tibet. Highly proficient spirit-mediums were held in awe;tales of their exploits spread throughout the locale and beyond.Invariably, the great lha-paof past generations were attributed super-natural powers. Their magical abilities are commonly thought tohave extended to riding on the backs of wild animals, flying in thesky, and incredible feats of healing and strength.Probably the first scholarly description of Tibetan spirit-mediumsis found in Sarat Chandra Das’s 1882 work Contributions on the Religionand History of Tibet(p. 11). This involves Bon priests who invoke andare then possessed by a tutelary deity referred to as bka’ bab3andthab-lha(god of the hearth). While under the influence of the gods,the medium is led to a defiled hearth where he plants a mda’ dar(festooned arrow), thereby ridding it of the disease-causing contam-ination. Das notes that sullying the hearth angers the subterraneansa-bdagspirits, a belief with much currency still today. Another lateVictorian work on Tibetan culture furnishes a more detailed de-scription of the lha-pa(calledlha-kha/lha-bka’) (Waddell 1895: 482–483).In this account, which generally holds true for today’s spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet, they function to relieve pain. In their practice they place one end of a festooned arrow on the afflictedarea of the patient and suck with the mouth on the other side, thusexpelling the demon from this part of the body. The lha-paaredescribed as wearing a mirror over the heart and the five-lobedrigs-lngaheaddress of mystic [Vajrayana] Buddhism. Waddell relates thatat the beginning of the trance ceremony Gu-ru rin-po-che and theBuddha are invoked. First to appear at the trance is the tutelarydeity who brings the kluand’drespirits with him. The spirit-mediumalso offers incense and libations to theyul-lha(god of the locale),which appears in the lha-pa’smirror.3This may refer to the god Phu-wer, the tutelary deity of the ancient Bon tra-dition of ye-dbang lha yi bka’ bab/babs(commands of the god of primordial power).For a detailed description see Part Four, section ii, pp. 348–350."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"general orientation7By their own admission, the spirit-mediums, through the dis-placement of their consciousness (rnam-shes),4actually become theincarnate form of the deity. They claim that their personal identityis substituted for that of the deity, thus their speech and bearingbecome that of the deity (cf. Ekvall 1964: 273, 274). Furthermore,it is averred that just split seconds before bodily entry, the con-sciousness of the lha-paexits and is replaced by that of a deity. Thepossession of the spirit-medium is referred to as lha ’bab-pa(deitydescending) and lha-bzhugs(deity residing), and is marked by radicalchanges in speech and comportment. Typically, possession occursafter the necessary invocations and offerings have been made to thevarious gods. Under the influence of a deity, thelha-pacommonlyexhibit profuse perspiration, signs of great physical strain, extraor-dinary strength, seizures, foaming at the mouth, and disappearanceof the irises in the back of the head. Many of the remedial or help-ing spirits of the trance take the forms of eagles, owls, bear, wolves,tigers and foxes, and under their possession the lha-pabehaves in alike manner. The spirit-mediums make calls and cries like animalsand imitate their movements and actions. They growl like tigers andbears, howl like wolves and cry out like raptors. The helping spir-its therefore, can often be identified by observers through the out-ward behavior of the spirit-medium.As a lha-pais widely believed to have become the deity, at theend of the trance there is no recollection of what transpired duringit. He or she usually has an assistant, a close friend or family mem-ber, who will relate what happened in the séance (the period inwhich the possessing deity was present). This assistant also helps inthe ceremony, bringing whatever offerings or objects the deity callsfor, and helping to translate its utterances. The voice of the deity isnot always comprehensible to those in attendance because of unusualvoice modulations, indistinct enunciation and low amplitude. Alsothe deities sometimes speak in foreign languages such aslha-skad(lan-guage of the gods), which can only be interpreted by those of longassociation with the lha-pa.It is generally accepted that a truelha-pacan only be host to oneconsciousness at a time. It is usually imagined that at the moment4The long form is rnam-par shes-pa, a word of Sanskrit origin (vijñana). Alternatively,some spirit-mediums believe that their consciousness principle is the bla(soul) orthugs(mind)."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"8part oneof possession his own consciousness is transferred to a metal mirror(me-long), where it remains in the protective embrace of a tutelarydeity until the end of the trance ceremony. Spirit-mediums maintainthat the personal consciousness exits from the top of the head whilethat of the deity (commonly referred to as ’od-zer) enters the spirit-medium through other parts of the head or hands. Moreover, it isthought that when the possessing deity exits from the spirit-medium’sbody, the personal consciousness returns in the same manner as ithad exited. Whilst in the body of the lha-pa, the deity’s consciousnessis said to dwell in the invisible channels spread throughout livingorganisms; these are known as rtsa. In Tibetan medical theory thesesubtle channels give rise to nervous impulses and are responsible forthe transmission of consciousness and sensory data. It is not unusualfor more than one deity to be involved in a trance ceremony. Inthat case, the deities are reported to wait in the me-longfor oneanother to leave the spirit-medium before the next one takes possession.As we shall see in Part Two, according to most spirit mediums,the origins of thelha-pacan be traced to Gu-ru rin-po-che, the Eighthcentury Vajrayana adept. He is said to have initiated four lineagesof spirit-mediums, spanning the four cardinal directions of Tibet.Senior spirit-mediums affirm that these lineages have continued tothe present day in the unbroken transmission of their profession.However, the Buddhist origin of spirit-mediumship in the oral tra-dition of Upper Tibet is probably apocryphal, reflecting the syn-cretism of the great Tibetan mythos. I embrace the view that thisprobable remodeling of mythology is the result of a historical revi-sionism (in both the literary and oral tradition), which occurred inthe transition from pre-existing religious systems to Buddhism. Inthis context, the Buddhacization of spirit-mediumship in Upper Tibetappears to be one strand in the reorganization of, and estrangementfrom, antecedent religious tradition.As shall be discussed in detail in Part Four, Bon legendary mate-rial purports that mediumistic cultural phenomena pre-date the Eighthcentury Gu-ru rin-po-che. From a comparative perspective, this seemsentirely feasible as cultures throughout the ancient world relied onoracles and mediums for various religious and social functions, asdo the world’s remaining subsistence tribes. I am of the opinion thatBon literature and the Upper Tibetan oral tradition do indeed pre-serve to varying degrees of integrity myths, practices and traditions(such as those involving spirit-mediumship), which pre-date the intro-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"general orientation9duction of Buddhism onto the Plateau. As archaeological evidencemounts for the existence of a sophisticated sedentary culture in UpperTibet in pre-Imperial times, I am inclined to see this data as sup-porting Bon historical and ritual conceptions about the relative antiq-uity of their religion and culture. This antiquity however, cannot beestablished as a historical fact from the literary and oral sources pre-sented in this work, and must perforce remain the author’s hypoth-esis. While it is clear that cultural continuity between the pre-Buddhistand Buddhist periods cannot be posited using the philological andanthropological methodologies at our disposal, I hasten to add thatthis does not disprove the cultural antiquity of spirit-mediumship, oreven render it unlikely.In Parts Two to Five, I examine numerous cultural and religioustraditions that are largely non-Buddhist in nature and indigenous inorientation. In this context, indigenous tradition can be defined asthat which sprung up or was redeveloped in Tibet, while the termnon-Buddhist adverts religious content that falls outside the boundsof popular and canonical Buddhism. The indigenous or native tra-dition is inextricably related to the Tibetan physical environmentand the living creatures that reside in it. The cults of the divine yakand ancestral mountain gods are two examples of indigenous cul-ture among many that I explore, utilizing the oral and literary recordsof Upper Tibet. As we shall see, Bon categorically maintains thatmany of the indigenous traditions treated in this work originated inthe Bon of the pre-Imperial period. This begs the question: if nativetradition does not, at least in part, derive from early or precursoryforms of Bon as the pre-Imperial religion of Upper Tibet, what per-chance was the makeup of the culture and religion of the region?I uphold that it is not warranted to assume that the Tibetanplateau proto-tribal cultures of pre-Imperial times were fully divorcedfrom all currently circulating cultural materials. To do so wouldeffectively deny Tibet’s distinctive identity (with its attendant uniqueethnic and linguistic components), essentially seeing it instead as ahistorical offshoot of an Indian or other neighboring civilization.Alternatively, one might argue that all traces of Tibetan pre-Imperialcultures were annihilated. Both of these conclusions, of a historicalTibet with no antecedents or direct links to a largely indigenouspaleoculture, appear nonviable to me. Yet, even if we are willing toentertain the possibility that Bon literature and the oral traditionencapsulate pre-Imperial cultural materials, questions of which ones"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"10part oneand in what form loom large. These are exceedingly difficult toanswer and will remain so until new sources of textual and archaeo-logical information become available for analysis.Regarding the cultural orientation of Tibet, I present the stand-point that a reconfiguration of its historical discourse, resulting froman obscuring and dissolution of early religious and mythic forms,caused Tibetans to become ever more remote from their pre-Imperialcultural heritage. The cultural history of Tibet over the last millen-nium would seem to testify to a relentless suppression, assimilationand reconstruction of antecedent legacies in an effort to bring themin compliance with Buddhist sensibilities and tradition. This holdstrue for both Buddhists and Bon-po despite the latter viewing them-selves as the legitimate successors of pre-Imperial culture. This assem-bling over the centuries of Buddhist-inspired ideas about culturalhistory and identity can only have been a highly complex process,involving popular social changes, political conditioning and the engi-neering of the literary record. In must also be pointed out that theformation of a dialectic about cultural development could not havebeen a uniform or linear process but rather a variable phenome-non—reflecting myriad geographical, sectarian and temporal con-texts. Returning to Upper Tibet, we find evidence of these potentialcultural historical developments in the following three main areas:1) Buddhacization of the indigenous pantheon and ritual practices.2) Concocted Gu-ru rin-po-che, Ge-sar epic and foreign occupationlegends woven around many pre-Buddhist archaeological sites andsacred geographic entities.53) The loss of clan-based traditions and social organization.Historically, the earliest references to mediums and the gods reveal-ing themselves through the mouth of humans (lha-bka’), both maleand female, appear to be found in the Tun-huang manuscripts writ-ten circa the Eighth or Ninth century (Stein 1972: 232). In Pelliot1047, a divination manuscript, there is mention of elderly femalemediums for the nine mu-smansisters (mountain and lake goddesses),who could predict the future and prescribe funerary rites for the5The Buddhacization of the indigenous pantheon of Upper Tibet is a themefound in Bellezza 1997.

This accountplaces the practice of spirit-mediumship 25 dynastic generations beforethefirst major introduction of Buddhism in Tibet during the reignof King Srong-btsan sgam-po. Like so many other attestations madein the literature however, we have no means at our disposal to ver-ify the historicity of this claim.Lha-bka’as an oracular function is possibly represented in the Tun-huang manuscript Pelliot 126. This text records a conversation betweentwo lordly figures belonging to the dMu and Phywa, who were veryimportant proto-tribes of Tibet. It is not clear however, whetherthese two individuals represent gods or men. The discourse they holdwith one another appears to be related to the acquisition of a tribaldeity by the Phywa. In order to obtain a protective deity, the dMuis entreated with complementary words and feted with various offerings.In one excerpt, the Phywa lord requests the directives of the deitybut it is not certain whether this is an allusion to an oracular eventor a kingly decree. If indeed these passages describe a divine prophecyand are not culturally unexampled, they seem to point to the exis-tence of a well-established institution of spirit-mediumship in theImperial period (617 to 846). The account begins with the speechof the dMu and ends with that of the Phywa who appears to havea proper name in the text:76In a Buddhist polemical attack on female practitioners called bon-mofound ina Tun-huang manuscript (India Office 220) it notes that they make prophecies andextort people to carry out animal sacrifices to spirits such as the lha, ’dreandsrin-mo(Stein 2003: 593, 594).7See Imaeda et al.2000,Pelliot 126, lns. 0155–0159.

I am obeying the lha-bka’.9Please conferupon me the bka’.”There are scant but tantalizing descriptions of early mediumisticactivities set in the pre-Imperial period in later Bon ritual texts aswell. In a 14th century account of the Phya-gshen theg-pa, the firstvehicle or system of teachings taught by the founder of the Bon reli-gion, gShen-rab, mention is made of an oracular tradition called ye-dbang lha yi bka’ babs(mantic directives of the god of primordialpower), which was revealed through the gshenreligious adepts (seefn. 3). According to Bon tradition, this revelatory tradition was oneof four systems of divination used in pre-Imperial times to formu-late the prognosis of patients. The class of Bon gods who spokethrough the ancient mediums is believed to have been the srid-pa’isgra-bla, which in personality, appearance and the manner they areentreated, closely resemble the powerful mountain gods used by thelha-paof today. Bon doctrinal assertions about the types of deitiesthe contemporary mediums depend on, their ceremonial equipmentand the rituals they perform under possession, all suggest that theyare close successors to this conceived pre-Imperial mediumistic tra-dition of srid-pa’i sgra-bla. If indeed this amounts to actual evidenceof a historical continuity in the tradition of spirit-mediumship betweenthe prehistoric and historic periods, the fact that Upper Tibet hasclung on to so many other native customs and traditions10can betaken as associative evidence. It also must be noted that this Bonpredicated continuity of tradition appears to be mirrored in thearchaeological record of Upper Tibet. For example, archaic animalmotifs in rock art11andthog-lcags(heterogeneous class of copper alloy8It is not certain if bka’ lung/bka’denotes the instructions or advice of a king,or whether it refers to a divine prophecy.9In this context, lha-bka’refers either to the utterances or directives of a kinglyfigure, or the revelations of a deity.10For a synoptic account of indigenous religious rituals and practices see Tucci1980, pp. 163–212.11For a survey of perdurable rock art motifs see Bellezza 2000; 2001, pp. 190–224;2002a, pp. 125–147; 2002b."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"general orientation13artifacts) seem to have persisted well into the historic period, as pos-sibly did early monumental architecture. Whatever their historicalgenesis, the cultural materials presented in this study indicate thatthe spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet retain one of the greatest pro-portions of native (if not atavistic) qualities still exhibited amongTibetan religious functionaries.From a Bon doctrinal perspective, the pre-Imperial mediumisticlegacy seems to survive, albeit in attenuated forms, among thelha-paof Upper Tibet (most of whom are Buddhists). Nevertheless, thereis no question among Tibetan observers, whatever their religious per-suasion, that the spirit-mediums have been heavily influenced byBuddhist thought and the Buddhist pantheon. Buddhist culture hasspread so deeply that most spirit-mediums perceive themselves aspursuing a tradition whose roots lie in Buddhism, scarcely recog-nizing the alternative Bon view of pre-Imperial cultural antecedents.The conceptions held by the spirit-mediums about the nature of pos-session, motivations for practicing, and the perceptions associatedwith its execution, have transformed the spirit-mediumship of UpperTibet into a thoroughly Buddhist affair. It is envisioned and expressedin Buddhist language and fully exercised under Buddhist auspices.The mountain gods and other deities of possession are therefore notseen as vestiges of an olden tradition but rather as legitimate, oath-bound protectors of the Buddhist doctrine. Similarly, their costumeand implements are not assigned a Bon identity but for the mostpart are viewed as part of the great Vajrayana tradition of TibetanBuddhism. The only exception to this general state of Buddhistorchestrated practice is the spirit-mediums who adhere to Bon, butfew remain in the Bon enclaves of Upper Tibet.12In the remaining section of this general introduction to the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet, I will summarize the salient features oftheir tradition and the perceptions they have regarding it. Detailedaccounts of these topics are found in the interviews contained inPart Two of this work.12Two of the Bon enclaves in Upper Tibet are sPo-che in gNam-ru (dPal-mgoncounty) and Dang-ra g.yu-mtsho in Nag-tshang (Nyi-ma county). See Bellezza 1997;2001 for information on these areas. Among the last Bon-po spirit-mediums ofDang-ra g.yu-mtsho was a woman named Sri-thar sgrol-ma (Bellezza 1997: 318,319). It is reported that she passed away circa 2000."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"14part oneIn its original form as conceived by the Bon-po, the tradition ofspirit-mediumship in Upper Tibet appears to have solely dependedon the pantheon of spirits bound in the physical environment suchas thelha, btsan, gnyanandklu, as well as related protective deitiescalledsgra-bla. In its present Buddhist-influenced configuration, spirit-mediums in Upper Tibet customarily rely on several types of divini-ties to accomplish trance states. These deities of the contemporarytrance ceremony are arranged in as many as five hierarchical tiers,and in descending order of status and importance include:1)Yi-dam(enlightened tutelary deities).2)’Jig rten las ’das pa’i srung-ma(protective deities that have passedbeyond the sphere of worldly existence) andmkha’ ’gro-ma(bene-factress deities).3)Lha-ri(chief mountain gods) and lha-mtsho(chief lake goddesses).4) (Lha-ri)’khor-bcas(members of the retinue of the mountain gods),btsan(martial spirits of mountains) and (lha-mtsho)’khor bcas (mem-bers of the retinue of lake goddesses).5) Remedial or ancillary servant spirits in anthropomorphic andzoomorphic form.In addition to these deities, as with other Tibetan religious phe-nomena, the omniscient Buddha himself is thought to be present atthe trance ceremonies as a kind of witness who exerts a salubriousinfluence. My research indicates that the first two hierarchical tiersof deities are present at every trance ceremony due to the indis-pensable nature of their work. The deities of the three latter cate-gories vary from trance to trance, although in practice the lha-pahave several gods that they are most acquainted with. With someexceptions, before the onset of the trance, it is not known whichgod and entourage will possess the spirit-medium. Typically, his orher identity is learned when the deity announces its presence to thosein attendance at the ceremony.Theyi-damare usually the deified early masters of VajrayanaBuddhism, Gu-ru rin-po-che and the grub-chen/grub-thob(mahasiddha).They oversee the proceedings of the trance and take special care ofthe health and personal integrity of the lha-pa. They are in essence,the patrons of the ceremony. The yi-damare usually the deities that the spirit-mediums worship in the normal course of their reli-gious observances. The spirit-mediums state that all other deities of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"general orientation15the trance are subservient to them in terms of power and ability,and must heed their spiritual guidance and advice. Mirroring Buddhistpractice, the Bon-po lha-paof Upper Tibet possibly had tutelary godssuch as Ge-khod and Me-ri, but there is little documentary evidenceof this remaining.Below the yi-damin importance are the protective deities, whichaccording to Bon and Buddhist theology, have passed beyond trans-migratory existence. They are often referred to as bstan-srung(pro-tectors of the doctrine), bka’ srung(protectors of the teachings) andchos-skyong(defenders of religion). The most popular ones of the spirit-mediums are the great Tibetan protectress dPal-ldan lha-mo and thevarious black protectors known as mGon-po (Mahakala). The Bon-po spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet probably had divinities like Srid-pa’i rgyal-mo or sTag-la me ’bar as their protective counterparts.13As we shall see, in some cases these protectors represent the lha-pa’shousehold or family protective deity. The lha-pabelieve that the pro-tector deities defend their interests and those of their patients andclients. The mediums allege that they prevent demonic entities frominterfering in the trance ceremony, and guard against the infectionof the lha-paby the evil spirits and contaminated substances theymust handle while carrying out healing activities. It is also commonlyattested that the protective deities collaborate with the chief pos-sessing deities and help them to accomplish their mission. The higherdeities, while playing an essential role in the trance ceremony, donot possess the spirit-mediums. They rather work from the outside,as it is customarily believed that no mere human being could with-stand their bodily invasion.Another group of deities that have the same or a slightly lowerstatus than the high protectors are themkha’ ’gro, the group of wis-dom-bearing goddesses in the Vajrayana tradition. From the variousaccounts of the lha-pa, they are best described as the benefactressesof the trance ceremony, responsible for the physical and mental well-being of the lha-pa. At the trance ceremony they have an active role13I base my observation on the fact that celebrated Buddhist phugs-lha(familyprotectors) are identical to the protectors of the spirit-mediums. My research demon-strates that in the Bon enclaves of Upper Tibet, most phugs-lhaare popular Bonprotective deities such as Srid-pa’i rgyal-mo, A-bse, Mi-bdud, Hur-pa, and sTag-lame ’bar.

They are alsosaid to serve as hostesses, welcoming and situating the other deitiesparticipating in the trance who appear from all directions. The care-taking consciousness of themkha’ ’grosurrounds the spirit-mediumfor the duration of the trance. It is generally held that the mkha’ ’grodo not usually enter inside the spirit-medium’s body. According tothe spirit-mediums however, they are a source of much reassurance,as quite a leap of faith is needed to abandon one’s body to a for-eign entity.The chief mountain gods (lha-ri)14found in the pantheon of manyof the spirit-mediums are gNyan-chen thang-lha and rTa-rgo dge-rgan.15These are two of the most powerful mountain gods in UpperTibet. My researches show that with the possible exception of themightiest of lha-pa, they do not deign to possess the bodies of humans.These archetypal father figures and ancestral deities are white incolor and ride white steeds. They are believed to function to upholdthe best interests of the spirit-mediums and patients alike. It is saidthat they usually manage the activities of the trance from the side-lines, yet they are aware of everything that is happening. I employthe analogy of a military operation to describe their actions: likegenerals on the battlefield, they direct their large armies of subsidiaryforms and servants to carry out specific procedures on the patient’sbehalf.

In thiscase, they are believed to have the power to harm people and ani-mals and even unleash plagues. If such a situation has developed,Tibetans traditionally feel that it is the lha-pa’s intervention that canrestore the balance between thelha-riand patient, thereby effectinga cure. Ancient lake goddesses such as gNam-mtsho phyug-mo and14For a general description of thelhasee Tucci 1949, p. 720.15For a comprehensive review of the textual and oral-based traditions pertain-ing to these deities and their large retinues see Bellezza 1997."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"general orientation17Dang-ra g.yu-mtsho, and their retinue of smanandklu-mospirits, alsopossess certain spirit-mediums.

Tibetanscommonly believe that many indigenous goddesses are either man-ifestations of dPal-ldan lha-mo or members of her huge retinue.According to the spirit-mediums, the main subsidiary form ofgNyan-chen thang-lha that possesses them is his son Thang-sras-mchor-po. He is popularly said to inhabit a sharp peak located justnorth of the Thang-lha massif. It is reported that Thang-sras mchor-po actually enters the lha-paand discharges the work of healing orprognostication. These functions are also commonly carried out byrDo-rje rkyang-khra, a deity usually thought of as being a memberof gNyan-chen thang-lha’s circle of gods. His residence is well knownto the ’brog-pa(shepherds); an outcrop in a vast plain situated northof dPa’ mtsho, in gNam-ru (dPal-mgon county). The lesser forms ofrTa-rgo most often involved in possession are thebtsandeities16Ngo-dmar lha-btsan and Gangs-lung lha-btsan, mountains located in thenorthern half of the rTa-rgo range.

They receive theirorders from their corresponding lha-ri, which is also present at theséance but characteristically occupying a less intimate location out-side of the spirit-medium.A survey of the spirit-mediums shows that the other main pos-sessing mountain gods are bTsan-rgod nam-ra, Rol-pa-skya-bdun andGangs-ri lha-btsan, which also belong to the btsanclass of protectivedeities. Spirit-mediums report that they act independent of the twochieflha-ri(Thang-lha and rTa-rgo), and when they are present atthe trance ceremony the chieflha-riare not, for they are affiliatedto different territories and theogonies. Consequently, when these btsandeities are involved one of the five tiers of the divine hierarchy iseffectively removed.

Some ’brog-paclaim that all ofthese Rol-pa groups were once possessing deities of the spirit-medi-ums.

Accordingto many informants, his main mountain abode is located on the bor-der of sGar-sde and sNye-mo, southwest of Thang-lha. In additionto the various mountain spirits, some lha-paare possessed by A-stagklu-mo, a heroine of the Gling ge-sar epic, who is supposed to havebeen an ancient ruler of Yar-khams in Upper Tibet.The possessing deities are thought to control a wide assortmentof remedial spirits who belong to their retinues. These are generi-cally referred to by the spirit-mediums as grib-sbyong(contaminationcleaners) and by the roughly homonymous terms ’jibs-spyang(suckingwolf ) and grib-spyang(contamination wolf ). They are the ‘foot sol-diers’ that remove impurities from the body of patients, do battlewith evil spirits and capture errant souls. As already noted, thesehelping spirits often assume zoomorphic forms. This peculiar classof deity can possibly be traced to an early period in the culturaldevelopment of Tibet. They are potentially represented in the pre-historic rock art of the region, which seems to include various the-riomorphicfigures, but at this time archaeological corroboration islacking. Similar zoomorphic deities were also used by other kinds ofTibetan religious practitioners, and they themselves were sometimestransformed into animals. For example, in the 12th century quasi-historical Bon textRig ’dzin rig-pa’i thugs-rgyud, the Zhang-zhung eraadept gZing-pa mthu-chen manifested as a wolf in order to recoverwandering souls (Bellezza 2001: 57, 58). In the biography of theDol-po lama dPal-ldan blo-gros (1467–1563), it relates that the yul-lha(deity of the locale) Nam-stod, in the form of a sheep with areddish brown face, helped him retrieve the soul of a sick person(Hazod 1996: 96). Likewise, a rare funerary manuscript of the Na-"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"general orientation19khi of the southeastern Tibetan borderlands, records that the stolensoul of a priest was reclaimed with the aid of his white dog, achicken, white crane, pig, black duck, bear, pheasant, and other ani-mals (Rock 1972: 471, 472).Spirit-mediumship in Upper Tibet has been kept alive by lineagesof practitioners, nearly all of which are hereditary. The professionis inherited from both one’s paternal and maternal ancestors. Themost prominent spirit-mediums are thought to be heirs to lineagesmany generations old. In some cases, so great in length was this suc-cession of forebears that the lha-paclaim it extends for nine or thir-teen generations. In the Tibetan language, these numbers haveacquired the import of ‘many’ or a ‘multitude’, and are metaphor-ically employed by the spirit-mediums to express a long-standingfamily tradition. Spirit-mediumship constituted one of the region’sgreat oral traditions, and most of the lha-paappear to have beenilliterate. My research proves that they learned their techniques andacquired their deities through tutelage and not through book knowl-edge. In fact, it does not appear that a manual was ever written toteach aspiring lha-pahow to practice. To the contrary, this is not avocation chosen voluntarily but foisted upon one by the deities them-selves. The lha-pahold that unless the deities specially select one,there is little chance of learning how to become their vehicle.Without exception among those spirit-mediums interviewed, pos-session by the deities, especially in the first few years, is a traumaticexperience that causes much distress; even mental and physical ill-ness. Initially, there was always the anxiety that the possessing entitymight be a demon instead of a bona fide god. It was explained tome that the family of the aspiring candidate usually called in a highlama to determine the nature of possession. The lama would blessthelha-paand exhort him or her to lead a wholesome life so thatthe deities could find suitable temporary residence inside the body.The spirit-mediums note that in the event a person was under malev-olent influences, an exorcism of the evil spirits was conducted. Theinitiation of a lha-pacould take up to several years and includedBuddhist or Bon devotional practices, trance sittings and pilgrimageto holy places. In the pre-Communist period, lamas regularly testedspirit-mediums to see if their abilities were up to the grade.17This17The initiation of a lha-paunder the auspices of abtsandeity called bTsan-rje"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"20part onewas sometimes carried out as part of a Lhasa government certificationprocess.

However, the nature of these cul-tural parallels cannot be satisfactorily elucidated, due to the highlyobscure historical and ethnological factors at play. At present, theagents of ethnohistorical formation involved do not readily lend them-selves to scientific analysis.As shown below, the practices and ritual implements of the lha-paof Upper Tibet share many affinities with central and north Asianshamanism. In my view, the existence of these analogous traditionsembedded in the substrate of cultures distributed over Inner Asiasuggests that there are indeed deeply buried genetic linkages. Postulatingan interrelated Inner Asian tradition of spirit-mediumship presup-poses a high degree of cultural diffusion, and this was potentiallyeffected through trade, conquest, intellectual exchange, and tribalassimilations over a period of no less then 3000 years (from theEneolithic to Yuan dynastic period).In earlier works, I have used comparative archaeological data toevince Iron Age cultural links between Upper Tibet and her north-ern neighbors.19My research indicates that archaeological assets withsnying-krung is described by Tucci (1980: 203, 204). It was conducted by a layreligious practitioner called a sngags-paand entailed recovering a hiddenbla-rdo(soulstone) for the purposes of divination. Thelha-pacalledpra-rten(support of divina-tion) in order to be successful, had to see all the good and bad things in the worldusing his mirror.18This information came from the current gNas-chung sku-rten-paThub-btsandngos-grub, in personal communication.19Paleocultural affinities between the pre-Buddhist archaeological heritage ofUpper Tibet and the Scytho-Siberian archaeological record of Inner Asia are thor-oughly examined in Bellezza 2002a."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"general orientation21similar morphological, constructional and design features, which arefound in Upper Tibet, Mongolia and the Altai, can probably betraced to the Scytho-Siberian period of the First Millennium BCE.In religious historical terms, this temporally corresponds with the so-called pre-shamanistic period in central and northern Asia and thepre-Imperial period in Upper Tibet. These archaeological parallelshowever, do not necessarily confirm that thelha-paand shamans ofcentral and northern Asia are successors to a tradition sufficientlylong-lived to be represented in an interrelated Iron Age cultural her-itage. Unfortunately, parallel lines of cultural development and refu-sion for subsequent periods are no less abstruse. Albeit both typesof practitioners are representative of well-established traditions, oursearch for historical ties between the lha-paand shamans of centraland north Asia is stymied by a lack of documentary evidence. Untilthe required breakthroughs in the fields of comparative archaeologyand ethnohistory occur, we will not have the means in our grasp toaccurately evaluate the analogous traditions of Upper Tibet and hernorthern neighbors.Before we examine traditions that might be held in common bythelha-paand their northern counterparts, let us place shamanismin a historical perspective. Strictly speaking, shamanism is a Turco-Mongolian cultural phenomenon involving various religious func-tionaries who refer to themselves as shamans.20In addition to healingand divination, the shamans of Central Asia and Siberia serve aspsychopomps who escort the souls of the dead to the afterlife(Hultkrantz 1996: 9–11). In Tibetan religion, this later function asa guide of the dead has been entirely assumed by the Bon andBuddhist lamas. It is theorized that the roots of shamanistic ideol-ogy can be traced to the division of labor and the establishment ofclass societies, which in south Siberia occurred at the end of theNeolithic and the onset of the Metal Age (Second and First MillenniumBCE) (Mikhajlov 1984: 100). It is thought by some specialists thatan archaic pre-shamanistic religion spread widely among the Siberian20For a general discussion of what constitutes a shaman in Asia see Lewis 1984;Gilberg 1984; Hultkrantz 1996. The term shaman is also used as a general termfor highly disparate practices the world over, predicated on a disassociation of cul-tural context and the reduction of diverse linguistic, symbolic and historical systemsinto a single objectified phenomenon.

As regards certain shamanistic attributes, particularly rit-ual implements and costume, it would appear that they were partof the pre-Turk cultural substrate (Vajn“tejn 1984: 367). However,the emergence of shamanism is difficult to gauge using archaeolog-ical evidence, as dead shamans and their ritual accouterments wereoften placed on raised platforms and subject to rapid decomposition( Jacobson 1993: 206–208). Nor does there exist a scholarly consen-sus on the application of rock art to the study of the origins ofshamanism (Hoppál 1992b: 132–134). Archaic Siberian petroglyphsof horned and masked figures cannot be identified as shamans dueto a lack of irrefutable archaeological evidence ( Jacobson 1993:206–208). In order to regard ancient petroglyphs as shamanistic onehas to posit nebulous cultural associations. These entail viewing con-temporary shamanism as heir to ancient Turco-Mongolian religioustraditions and that these, in turn, can be understood in the contextof Scytho-Siberian archaeological data (Francfort 1998: 313). Needlessto say, the same types of cautions, regarding relating observableanthropological activity to archaeological evidence, apply in anyattempt to compare Upper Tibetan rock art with the traditions ofthelha-pa. Central Asian shamanism, as we now know it, is the resultof widespread movements of the Huns, Turks, Khitans and Uighursin Yuan times (Mikhajlov 1984: 97). It is a syncretistic phenomenoncontaining elements of early cults, which were affected by Buddhism,Hinduism, Zoroastrianism and other oriental religions (ibid.: 98).Although ethnically specific, strong similarities in shamanism exist inareas such as mythology, ritual, the structure and composition of thepantheon, and religious terminology (ibid.: 98, 99).Despite not being able to elucidate the ethnological and histori-cal factors that may have given rise to the various traditions sharedby the lha-paand shamans, it is important to enumerate these tra-ditions in order to gain an appreciation of the degree of affinity thatexists between these religious functionaries. These similarities in prac-tice, ritual implements and deities, in functional terms, reflect wide-ranging traditions of deity possession. The shamanistic cultural groupsnoted in the next several paragraphs all hail from various areas ofcentral and northern Asia. In the latter part of this section, I willundertake a comparative study of the lha-paand their counterpartsin other Tibetan regions and allied cultures. Coming closer afield toUpper Tibet many congruencies in spirit-mediumship are discern-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"general orientation23able. These parallels in Bodic tradition have both historical and eth-nic dimensions.Theme-long(circular metal mirror), along with the drum and gshang,is the most important ritual implement of the lha-pa. It functions asthe residence of the possessing deities and their retinue of remedialspirits, and as the abode of the spirit-medium’srnam-shes(conscious-ness),bla(soul) or thugs(mind) during the trance. Likewise, for theNanai Shamans of Inner Asia brass mirrors (toli) served as the recep-tacle of their various spirits (Smoljak 1984: 246). Among those resid-ing in the mirror were deer and dogs that dispatched souls to theland of the dead (ibid.: 245). The most prized Tibetan me-longareancient specimens that are believed to have fallen from the sky, andare called thog-lcags(primordial/thunderbolt metal). These are handeddown for generations in family lineages of lha-pa, or discovered inhidden places. More than 2000 years ago, brass mirrors spreadthroughout south Siberia (Smoljak 1984: 246) and likewise, were laterhighly coveted by groups of shamans in Central Asia and Siberia.Some shamans hung ancient bronze mirrors, which were considereda powerful protecting spirit, on their coats (Vajn“tejn 1984: 365). InMongolia, shamans wore metal mirrors (toli) with an apotropaic func-tion fastened to their aprons, and on their chest and back (Heissig1980: 19). Tibetan lha-paoften wear plain me-longor ones embossedwith the Tibetan calendar on their chests for protective purposes.An important implement of the lha-paof Upper Tibet is the mda’dar, a festooned arrow used for attracting good fortune and exor-cising demons. The Buryat shamans and other peoples of Siberiaalso used an arrow in various religious ceremonies (Nebesky-Wojkowitz1956: 543, 544), as did the Mongolians for divination purposes(•arkozi 1984: 331). In the hunting rituals of the Khitans (rulednorthern China from 907–1125), the arrow symbolized the male, asis frequently found in Inner Asia (Baldick 2000: 6, 31), with Tibetbeing no exception. The Khitans also used the arrow in rituals toexpel demons (Francke 1983: 11). Similarly, a celebrated instrumentof both the lha-paand shamans of Central Asia and Siberia is thedrum. Siberian shamans have drum-skins made of consecrated deer-hide ( Jacobson 1993: 176, 177), while drum-skins made of gazelle-hide and snake-skin are known among the spirit-mediums of UpperTibet. Other analogies between the respective groups involve the useof raptor feathers in headdresses, and the burning of juniper incense.For example, the male and female shamans of Tuva stick eagle andowl feathers in their conical cap headdresses (Djakonova 1996: 158,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"24part one159, 163), while the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet use a plume ofvulture feathers in similarly shaped conical caps (btsan-zhwa).Great feats of strength and magic have been attributed to boththe spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet and their northern shaman coun-terparts. Among thelha-paof Upper Tibet, it is common to dividetheir profession into three categories of ceremonial proficiency: supe-rior, average and inferior. A congruous tradition was found amongthe Yakut shamans, who were divided into three categories: great,average and weak, judged by the amount of spirits under their con-trol (Alekseev 1984: 269). Thelha-pa, in conformance with an ancientTibetan cosmological concept, divide the universe into three verti-cal spheres (srid-pa-gsum) Similarly, the Tuvans divided their universeinto two or three vertically-oriented spheres (Vajn“tejn 1984: 354).The Nanai also had a tripartite vertically-oriented universe (Okladnikov1981: 19), as did the Yakuts (Hatto 1970: 10) and Evenks (Vasilevich1963: 48, 49, 72). Another striking similarity between the lha-paandshamans of Central Asia and Siberia is the general use of a suck-ing technique to remove impurities that cause diseases. Moreover,the vocation of shamans in Siberia is often hereditary, as it is amongthelha-pa(cf. Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956: 549, 550). For divination theEvenki shamaness uses a device made of nine threads (Bulatova 1997:240), while nine threads are used in the healing rituals of certainspirit-mediums of Upper Tibet.The spirit-mediums practicing in Upper Tibet have mountain godswho serve as patrons and officiate over the trance ceremony, andsubsidiary forms of mountain deities who actually possess them andcarry out various functions. Khaka shamans also invoked mountainspirits during their rites for assistance and protection, and the Ku-mandin shamans could have their clan’s mountain spirit as a patrondeity (Alekseev 1984: 271, 272). Kachin shamans had mountaindeities as helping spirits in both zoomorphic and anthropomorphicforms, including figures mounted on horses, white and black birds,wolves, bears, dogs, elk, chamois, frogs, snakes and lizards (ibid.: 272).Kizil shamans also seemed to have had helping spirits in the formof mountains and bodies of water (ibid.: 272). The Tuvan shamanshad helping spirits (èren) in the form of eagles, owls, falcons, bearsand wolves.21The main function of the èrenwas to protect humans21See Vajn“tejn 1984, p. 355; 1996, pp. 168, 169."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"general orientation25from the demons of disease, which could be expelled by the spiritsof animals (Vajn“tejn 1996: 168, 169). These iconographic forms andfunctions of the èrenare reflected in the helping spirits of the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet as well. There is also common groundbetween the two geographic traditions of mediumship in the articu-lation of these helping spirits in the trance ceremony. The Tuvanshamans imitate the voices of a variety of animals including bears,wolves and eagles (Kenin-Lopsan 1997: 132), as do their counter-parts in Upper Tibet. Among the shamans of Tuva, helping spiritswere also the master-spirits of sacred mountains, and their costumesymbolized a bird, which was probably a helping spirit (Alekseev1984: 272, 275). Mountain remedial spirits in the form of raptorsare likewise common among the Tibetan spirit-mediums. VariousTurco-Mongolian groups such as the Kachins and Sagais believedthat the mountain and clan spirits rode horses of different single col-ors (Potapov 1996: 112, 113), another tradition that finds resonancein Upper Tibet.The possessing deities of the lha-pacontrol their circles of helpingfigures—remedial spirits in zoomorphic and anthropomorphic form—involved in therapeutic activities. The most common animal spiritsof the lha-paare bears, wolves and carnivorous birds, with foxes,dogs and other animals also known. Clear functional parallels existin the shamanism of the Altai and Siberia. For example, the Yakutshamans had a main assistant (could be ancestor or deity of the sky)in the form of an elk, bear, stallion, wolf or ox, who would medi-ate between people and other groups of spirits (Alekseev 1984: 269).They also had helping spirits in the guise of humans and animals(ibid.: 269). The Tölös, a Southern Altaian ethnic group, had patron-izing and helping spirits in the shape of bears, wolves and snakes(ibid.: 270). The Evenk shamans had deputy spirits in the shape ofelk, reindeer, bears and eagles (Anisimov 1963: 96, 97). Todji shamansalso had animals, ravens, eagles and hawks among their helping spir-its (Alekseev 1984: 275). Likewise, Dolgans shamans have fox andwolf helpmates (Nebesky-Wojkowitz: 541). A Nivkhi shamaness ofSakhalin is documented appealing to a grandfather tiger to have pityand help her not fall ill (Taksami 1996: 104). The tiger as a remedialspirit is also used by spirit-mediums in Upper Tibet.Spirit-mediums known asdpa’ boandlha-paare active in regionsacross the Tibetan plateau and Himalayan rim-land. They are moreor less related to their counterparts in Upper Tibet, in terms of"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"26part onepractice and historical origins. One group exhibiting archaic tradi-tions are the male dpa’ boand female bsnyen jo-moof Sikkim, Bhutanand the southern Tibetan borderlands. Like thelha-paof UpperTibet, this is often a hereditary vocation in which the mediums actas vehicles for their personal protective spirits, and at one time dancedholding a small drum (rnga-chung) and flat-bell (gshang) (Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956: 425–428).22The important oracle of the sKur-stoddistrict of Bhutan, called the gter-bdag dpa’ bo, wears the btsan-chas(dress of the btsan), plays the ∂a-ma-ruhand-drum and sucks illness-causing poisons from his patients (Yablonsky 1997: 1095, 1096), allpractices found among the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet.In A-mdo, lha-papractice more freely than in Upper Tibet andparticipate in high-profile fortune-bestowing communal festivals. Lha-paplay an officiating role at the summer solstice connected glu-rolfestival (performed to insure the well-being of the community, cropsand livestock) of Rab-skong (Nagano 2000). These functions of theA-mdo spirit-mediums are of course matched by their opposite num-ber in Upper Tibet. The seniorlha-paof Rab-skong is possessed bya martial spirit named dGra ’dul dbang-phyug and the youngerlha-paby a spirit called Blon-po, both of which are in the circle of themountain god A-myes rma-chen spom-ra (ibid.: 576). The senior lha-paperforms a divination with a black yak horn to predict the suc-cess of the festival and the outcome of the next harvest, as well asdetermining the luck of individual households in the coming year(ibid.: 577, 578, 580, 586, 587). The glu-rolalso includes the klu-bsangs(offerings to water spirits) rite held in a brook, which is performedby the lha-pa(ibid.: 577). Offerings to the klualso play an importantpart in the rituals of the lha-paof Upper Tibet.Lha-paandlha-mo(female mediums) with functions similar to thosefound in Upper Tibet are known in conterminous Ladakh (La-dwags),where they are believed to cure illnesses, conduct divination, andexorcise evil spirits (Day 1990: 206, 208).23In keeping with Bon and22Themunand other Lepcha spirit-mediums of Sikkim also usually representhereditary professions (Gorer 1987: 215). For a study of the ritual activities (pro-pitiation of personal deities, harvest offerings, etc.) of the dpa’ boin the Sikkim vil-lage of Tingchim see Balikci Denjongpa 2002.23In an early 20th century account of divination, the Wazirof Ladakh orderedtwolha-pato go into trance near a lha-tho(stone altar) of a sacred grove and iden-tify a thief and his whereabouts (Ribbach 1979: 191, 192)."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"general orientation27Buddhist tradition, spirit-mediums of both regions work for the benefitof sentient beings, healing both humans and animals. The lha-paofLadakh tend to follow an inherited profession (ibid.: 208), as they doin adjacent Upper Tibet. As a prelude to becoming a lha-moinLadakh, women can suffer from mental disturbances (Schenk 1993:333), as they do in Upper Tibet. The principal possessing deity ofthelha-paof Ladakh is commonly a villageyul-lha, khyim-lha(house-hold deity) or lha ’dre(in this context: minor deity or ghost), and isinvoked by reciting a gser-skyems(libation offerings) with the ∂a-ma-ruin the right hand and a dril-bu(Buddhist bell) in the left.24A simi-lar manner of invoking deities is found among thelha-paof UpperTibet; however, they use the Bon gshanginstead of the Buddhist bell.Also, the divinities of Upper Tibet tend to be much more powerfulexamples of the indigenous Tibetan pantheon than the Ladakhideities. Thelha-paof Ladakh generally have an inferior or ambiva-lent status in society, and do not come from the aristocratic clans(Day 1990: 207, 208, 216). On the other hand, while their statusfalls far below that of incarnate lamas, thelha-paof Upper Tibethave not been as dominated by the lamaist ecclesiastical hierarchyas their counterparts in Ladakh, at least in part due to their isola-tion from major monastic centers. This helps to explain why the lha-paof Upper Tibet can belong to the most prominent clans of theregion.Thelha-paof Ladakh use the mirror as a temporary residence ofthe deities, and amda’ dar(festooned ritual arrow) to call spirits, asa support of deities and as a symbol of prosperity (Day 1990: 211,214, 215); mirror and arrow practices of thelha-paof Upper Tibetas well. Likewise, the Ladakhi lha-pa, whose deity-possession is markedby the donning of the rigs-lngaheaddress, perform drum divination,speak in Tibetan and suck grib(impurities) causing illness from theirpatients with their drum (Yamada 1995), just as is done by theirpeers in Upper Tibet. Ladakhi lha-paremovegribin the form ofblack and other-colored mucus (Srinivas 1998: 144), a common prac-tice in Upper Tibet as well. A wolf deity of a lha-moin Ladakh (Day1990: 211) is also reminiscent of the Siberian and Upper Tibet tra-ditions. The Ladakhi lha-padiagnose misfortune caused by a conflictbetween a newlywed couple’s protective deities (Srinivas 2001: 133–134).24See Day 1990, pp. 209, 211, 212, 216; Yamada 1995, pp. 88, 89, 93."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"28part oneThis too is one of the functions of spirit-mediums in Upper Tibet.Thelha-paof the btsandeity gZhon-nu mdung-lag, the yul-lhaofwestern Zangs-dkar, belongs to the same general tradition as hiscounterparts in Ladakh and Upper Tibet. Like the spirit-mediumsof Upper Tibet, he is a layman coming from one of various clans,and is perceived to have curative, diagnostic and mantic functions(Riaboff1996: 29, 37). The Zangs-dkar lha-pawears the rigs-lngaheaddress and plays the ∂a-ma-ru, and still has important commu-nity functions (ibid.: 36, 37). In the Upper Tibet of the Communistperiod, the participation of lha-pain community festivals has beenabolished. The most famous sku-rten(oracle-healers) in Ladakh aretwo monks from the Sa-skya-pa monastery of Mang-spro, who incor-porate a local deity, Rong-btsan dkar-dmar.25As with btsandeitiesin Upper Tibet, Rong-btsan is subordinate to Buddhist protectorssuch as mGon-po, illustrating how the tradition of spirit-mediumshiphas been accommodated to Buddhism. Likewise, Rong-btsan addressesconcerns about physical and mental health, community happiness,and the forecasts for crops and other matters.Lha-paare also found in sPi-ti (Spiti), where their practice isinfluenced by traditions originating in both Upper Tibet and cis-Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh.26Among the functions ofthelha-paof Spiti are the curing of diseases, the exorcising of demonsand fortune-bestowal. The lha-paof Spiti are active at three com-munal celebrations: Namkin (a harvest festival), Lo-gsar (TibetanLunar New Year), and the bsod-nams lo-gsar(winter solstice). In a win-ter fortune-bestowing ritual, the lha-pabSod-nams tshe-ring of Brag-mkhar became possessed by the localyul-lhaJo-dar. During the trance,which took place in his kitchen, he wore a special turban (lha-thod)for the performance and held a vase and a bundle of peacock feath-ers. While possessed by Jo-dar, bSod-nams tshe-ring stood up in barefeet and congenially conversed about the value of Buddhism. Theend of the possession was marked by a squeal as the lha-pafell toa sitting position.In Spiti, there is a winter solstice festival called lha-gsol(deity pro-pitiation) held in honor of the various yul-lhato insure the well-being25For information on the mediumship of Rong-btsan see Tewari 1987.26This information on the lha-paof Spiti was collected by the present author onafield trip to the region, in 1992."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"general orientation29of the community in the coming year. In the village of Ta-po, thelocalyul-lhasMan-skyong has no voice and can only be reached bythelha-pawhen a monastic protectress named rDo-rje chen-mo, oneof three sisters residing in the vicinity, possesses him. In the lha-gsolof 1992, the lha-pawas clad in alha-thodturban. In his right hand,he held an instrument called a pho-brang, a staffwith many hangingcolored ribbons surmounted by a trident, which serves to call downthe deity. Under the possession of rDo-rje chen-mo the lha-paspokein a garrulous fashion about the need of the villagers to carefullyprotect their culture and traditions. Before the trance ended, thelha-patossed a handful of barleycorns at the bottles of chang(beer) andghanti(spirits) brought by each household of Ta-po. The bottle intowhich a kernel of barley landed was the one selected by rDo-rjechen-mo to be offered to the yul-lha. Afterwards, this bottle of alco-hol and rlung-rta(prayer flags) attached to juniper boughs, from eachhousehold, were carried by male members to the shrine of sMan-skyong.Thelha-paof the Sherpas (Shar-pa) usually pursue a hereditaryprofession, and are chosen involuntarily by the deities (Fürer-Haimendorf 1979: 255). The Sherpalha-pause therigs-lngahead-dress, which sometimes has feathers.27The spirit-mediums of theSherpas are attributed with the ability to diagnose the cause of ill-ness and misfortune, the power of healing, deities that inhabit mir-rors, and the ability to speak in the language of the gods,28commoncharacteristics of thelha-paof Upper Tibet as well.In Tibet, the most famous class of spirit-mediums were the sku-rten-pa(body supporter),29which were possessed by powerful protec-tors such as the god Pe-har and Tshangs-pa (Brahma), as well asby malevolent ghosts of the gshin ’dreandrgyal-poclasses of demons.Thesku-rtenprofession was open to both men and women of allsocial classes (Havnevik 2002: 262, 277, 278), as are mediumisticactivities in Upper Tibet. In formulating policy, the old Tibetan27See Fürer-Haimendorf 1979, p. 256; Adams 1996, pp. 186–194.28See Fürer-Haimendorf 1979, p. 261; Adams 1996, pp. 186–194.29ThePe-haroracle is also commonly called chos-rje(lord of religion), chos-skyong(protector of religion) and chos-rgyal(king of religion).

However,those that relied on dangerous spirits of a more recent pedigree,instead of autochthonous protective deities like the mountain gods,indicate that these sku-rten-pabelonged to an alternative (historicallyderivative?) tradition of spirit-mediumship. Like the lha-pa, the sku-rten-pawere often laymen, and the costumes, paraphernalia, mirrors,and vulture feather plumes used by both groups bear much resem-blance. Similarly,thesku-rten-pacould display supernatural strengthas when twisting a thick steel sword blade.30The most famous andpowerfulsku-rten-pais the gNas-chung oracle for rDo-rje grags-ldan,the leader of the sKu-lnga group of protective deities, whose prin-cipal emissary is Pe-har, the chief of the dGe-lugs-pa sect protectivedeities. The current oracular tradition was initiated in 1542 (TibetanBulletin 1992: 23). The present oracle, the Venerable Thub-bstandngos-grub (born 1958), reports that before his first possession in1987, he experienced strange headaches, emotional agitation, andbled from the mouth and nose (ibid.: 26). These kinds of physicaland mental disturbances also affect the lha-paof Upper Tibet. Intrance, the Pe-har oracle speaks in a poetical language (ibid.: 28), a phenomenon known among the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet as well.Many of the practices and traditions of the Pe-har sku-rten-pahavenever been written down and remain highly secret.31The deity Pe-har is the ’phrin-las(activity) and main manifestation of a group ofdeities known as sKu-lnga. Although Pe-har has passed beyond thesphere of worldly existence, as gtso-bo(chief ) of the lha-srin sde-brgyad(eight orders of elemental spirits), he has a close affinity with themountain gods and other indigenous deities. The costume worn bythe Pe-har sku-rten-pais called lha’i chas(divine costume), and he saysthat it is of the type used by Gling ge-sar of the Tibetan epic andthe warrior deities known as dgra-lha. It consists of a helmet andcuirass, which are worn by mountain gods and by Tibetan warriors30See Rock 1935, p. 478; Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956, p. 420; Ekvall 1964, pp.273, 274.31The information on Pe-har and his sku-rten-pain this and the following twoparagraphs came from the present oracle Thub-bstan dngos-grub, the 14th mem-ber of the lineage, in personal communication.

The Pe-har sku-rten-pareports that the headdress he uses isthedbu-rmog(helmet), and is surmounted by the lcog-dar,five sets ofpennants and white bya-rgod(vulture) plumes.32He explains that thesefeathers symbolize that the chos-skyongPe-har is the highest of pro-tectors, as the vulture is the highest-flying and most powerful of birds.The vulture feather plumes used by the lha-palikewise have an exaltedsymbolic position. On this subject Thub-bstan dngos-grub, the Pe-harsku-rten-pa, writes:33The vulture feather decorating the top of the lcog-daris a sign that thevulture has the ability to fly enduringly to the bounds of the divinepath (sky), and it has the power to conquer the entire realm of evil,the perpetrators of the flight of wicked thought and activities.

Thub-bstan dngos-grub statesthat it is used to call the deities because it produces a sound remi-niscent of a dragon’s roar, which is pleasing to them. While the mda’darand various animals do not figure in the trance of the sku-rten-pa, he points out that effigies of animals and arrows are used to pro-pitiate the sKu-lnga in rituals such as mdos(enticements),rten ’bul(support offerings), and g.yang-sgrub(good fortune empowerment).Although the Pe-har sku-rten-pais the state oracle, in certain instanceshe makes prophecies for members of the general public, such aswhen he recommends a specific hospital for a critically injured per-son. He also has a healing function that is carried out by spittingblack tea on people. He affirms that this action has the power toremove diseases. While in trance, black tea is also spat on barley-corns to produce a highly coveted charm called phyag-nas.Phyag-nasis popularly believed to be able to heal diseases, eliminate night-mares, and bring good luck to travelers and business people. At thebeginning of the trance, the Pe-har sku-rten-padances with a bow inhis left hand (an arrow is at his side) and a saber in his right hand.When the dance finishes he throws the bow and sword down, sig-naling that all obstructions have been expelled (bgegs-sgrol).

These types ofdeities are doctrinally related to the lake goddesses of Upper Tibet,and their activities also find expression among the lake divinities.Other parallels between the female state oracle and the lha-paofUpper Tibet include: hereditary lineages, purification of the body as34This information on Blo-bzang tshe-sgron comes from Havnevik 2002; Byang-ngos-pa tshe-g.yang 2002."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"general orientation33a prerequisite of mediumistic activity, avoidance of tobacco, and theentry of the possessing deities through the fingers. Another importantfemale medium from Lhasa, A-ne lo-chen of Shug-gseb monastery,was possessed by a btsan-rgod(btsanclass spirit) and various localdeities (Schenk 2002: 275, 276), the backbone of spirit-mediumshipin Upper Tibet.The Gurung and Tamang spirit-mediums of Nepal also have cer-tain practices and beliefs that appear to be historically interconnectedwith those of the lha-paof Upper Tibet. For one thing, the mostcommon ritual implement of these groups is the drum, which is usedin the respective trance ceremonies for calling the deities. In addi-tion to Tibetan Buddhism, the Gurungs of central-west Nepal prac-tice a Siberian type of shamanism, the central cosmological elementbeing a world tree that interconnects the three spheres of the uni-verse (Mumford 1990: 6–8). In Upper Tibetan mythology, the sacredmountains fulfil the same function, bridging the three realms of exis-tence (srid-pa-gsum). The Gurungs have two types of shamans, includ-ing the paju(pha-jo) whose tutelary deities are in the form of a maleor animal (ibid.: 119). In an elaborate ceremony, thepajuenters intotrance and searches for the lost souls (bla) of patients by ascendinga mountain, tree and ladder to the upper world (dmu’i go ’phang?),and by descending into the underworld (khro dmyal-sa ?) (ibid.: 169–172).In Upper Tibet, it is the possessing deities and their helpers thatsearch for errant bla(souls).Like the lha-paof Upper Tibet, the Tamang bomboof Nepal per-form healing rituals in which evil spirits are banished, lost souls (bla)recalled, the future told, and good fortune bestowed.35Moreover, thebombohonor a personal btsan, and it is the btsanthat is responsiblefor revelations, as well as being a main possessing deity.36The cen-tral role played by the btsandeities has clear parallels with the UpperTibet tradition of spirit-mediumship. The bomboalso invoke a moun-tain deity queen Jo-mo g.yang-ri rgyal-mu (Schmid 1967: 85, 86).Another correspondence between thelha-paof Upper Tibet and theTamangbombois the use of the khyung(mythic horned eagle) in cer-tain healing rituals.

In Upper Tibet, afox skull is sometimes used in rituals to exorcise the sridemons. Thecis-Himalayan shamans of various ethnic groups in Nepal often weara long white gown, white turban and a headdress with peacock orpheasant feathers.37As we shall see, vestigial turbans (thod) and vul-ture feathers are also used by the lha-paof Upper Tibet, recallingthe costume of the ancient Bon priests called gshen.In the northwestern Nepal district of ’Om-lo (Humla) exist spirit-mediums called dha-miand those who officiate at their trance cere-monies, the bhrang-ris.38The latter is the lha-gsol-mkhan, the one whoburns incense and invokes the deities, often in the local dialect. Likethelha-paof Upper Tibet, the bhrang-risuse the gshangbell. Bothtypes of functionaries of ’Om-lo wear white woolen garments andwhite cotton turbans. The function of the dha-mitrance is to insurethe welfare of individuals, the community and livestock. They alsomake pronouncements about the future through divination. Purificationby bathing is an important preparatory practice for the dha-mi, andthey often make pilgrimage to mTsho ma-pham, in western Tibet.As with many of the lha-paof Upper Tibet, the dha-miwear theirhair unshorn and piled on top of the head. Among their possessingdeities are yul-lhaand Buddhist protectors. The dha-miPadma fromthe village of sTod, is a spirit-medium for three aspects of Gangs-dkar (Gangs-rin-po-che), a god who only accepts dkar-mchod(offeringsnot involving the taking of life): dKar-po dung-ldan (White ConchOne), Ser-po gser-ldan (Yellow Gold One) and sNgon-po g.yu-ldan(Blue Turquoise One). While pacific mountain god manifestationsare also common among the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet, theparticular possessing form of Gangs-rin-po-che, Gangs-ri lha-btsan,is a wrathful red-colored deity. In the vicinity of Bar-khang, in ’Om-lo, there are around twenty families, including bhrang-ris, who believethat they immigrated in the distant past from Khyung-lung, in UpperTibet.37Color photographs of a Rai shamaness attired in this manner are found inMülleret al. 2002, pp. 45, 46, 173.38This information on the dha-miof ’Om-lo came from Nag-ru dge-legs sbyin-pa, a librarian at Khri-brten nor-bu-rtse monastery, Kathmandu.

The proceedings of the trance ceremonies arethoroughly described, and their technical and material aspects care-fully catalogued. The personal histories and professional initiationsof the various mediums are also elaborated.All but two of the fifteen spirit-mediums interviewed for this worklive in the wide expanses of northern Tibet, making access to themdifficult. In recent times, their traditional activities have been heav-ily circumscribed and some have curtailed their spirit-mediumshipaltogether. Due to the censure they have faced, the lha-pawere occa-sionally hesitant to speak about their profession. I had to exercisecare and diplomacy so as not to invoke painful memories, and toinsure that my questions remained within the anthropological guide-lines set forth by the government of the Tibet Autonomous Region.These guidelines were developed in conjunction with the TibetanAcademy of Social Sciences.Despite the difficulties they have had to endure, the lha-pagen-erally proved cooperative and helpful. However, as many have notpracticed since 1959, or only to a modest degree, details of theirprofession have slowly ebbed with time. As memories fade and scopefor practice diminishes, the holders of the tradition of spirit-medium-ship relinquish ever more of their knowledge and ability, endan-gering the continuation of their lineages. Moreover, as changingsocial conditions increase their marginalization in Upper Tibet, chancesto study the lha-pawhilst in trance were only infrequently forth-coming, and these tended to be short, subdued performances. Theabsence, in this day and age, of elaborate public performances pre-cluded the recording of significant pre-Communist traditions of thespirit-mediums. My interviews and observations therefore, were akind of ethnographic salvage operation intended to document theremnants of a rich tradition.39For previous findings regarding two other spirit-mediums in Upper Tibet seeBellezza 1997, pp. 62–65, 318–320."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"36part oneIn Nepal and India, where several interviews with lha-pawere held,there are few political inhibitions to the practice of spirit-mediumship.As is well known, both of these countries have their own diversetraditions of spirit-mediumship, spanning many geographic areas andethnic groups. Nevertheless, there are factors affecting the integrityof the Tibetan tradition in exile. These revolve around a generalsense of apathy, or even hostility in the Tibetan community regard-ing the philosophy and practices of the lha-pa, and the trend awayfrom localized traditions towards more homogenous expressions ofculture and religion. Although a sociological analysis of the role ofthe spirit-mediums in exile communities is beyond the scope of thisstudy, it must be pointed out that modernization and orthodoxBuddhism have not favored the lha-pawho embody the so-called ’jig-rten pa’i lha(worldly gods and spirits).Both inside and outside Tibet,as ever more obstacles are put in the way of the spirit-mediums ofUpper Tibet, the very survival of their profession is called into ques-tion. This state of affairs has had a huge impact on the purview anddirection of this study. The disappearance of spirit-mediumship how-ever, does not seem to have had an adverse impact on the integrityand quality of the data that I have compiled. What lha-pado remainappear to have internalized the tradition with a remarkable degreeof competency. This is reflected in the way that the foundations andpractices of spirit-mediumship are strikingly uniform throughout UpperTibet.Thelha-painterviewed are all well-known figures in their respec-tive communities. In the sparsely populated Byang-thang the repu-tations of the few remaining spirit-mediums have carried as far astwo hundred kilometers from their place of residence. As there arevery few practicing lha-paleft, those who have tried other remedieswithout success occasionally seek them over long distances. However,as the activities of spirit-mediumship are severely restricted, and theclient-base very small, their practice is usually limited to several town-ships at most. The persistence of the lha-pa, despite the very difficultconditions they have had to endure in the last several decades, seemsto be explained by the great faith some Tibetans have in their ther-apeutic capabilities and prowess.My research establishes that similarities in belief and ceremonialpractice aside, the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet are normally dis-tinguished by their peerless behavior. This also appears to be thepredominant perception of those who live in their communities. I"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"general orientation37have found that in daily life, they comport themselves with dignityand aplomb, akin to the conduct of good monks and lamas. Theyare however, laymen with families, livestock and business interests.I was also favorably struck by their hospitality, patience and under-standing. Typically, the lha-paare people who enjoy a full life span.It is not unusual for them to reach their seventies and eighties inrelatively good health.I have conducted what amounts to preliminary interviews with thelha-pa.Over the last eight years, in the course of my extensivearchaeological and ethnographic exploration of Upper Tibet, I soughtout the lha-pato learn more about their traditions and practices. Myaim was to interview every elderly and/or locally renowned spirit-medium in Upper Tibet, west of Nag-chu city. By my reckoning,there are around twenty such surviving individuals, fifteen of whomare presented in this work (the study of the other mediums willappear in future works). I conducted all interviews on my own accord(sometimes under the supervision of Tibetan officials and colleagues),simultaneously translating the information I received into notebooks.Later, I would compose my notes into journals and ask follow-upquestions. By 1999, I had compiled around 200 potential questionsto ask the mediums and to serve as a basis for improvisation dur-ing the interviews. Specific responses varied widely and it was notunusual for some or even many of my questions to have remainedunanswered for the interviewees’ lack of acquaintance with the sub-ject matter.Further association with the spirit-mediums would surely bringmany new facts to light. There is still much to learn about their tra-ditional social roles in the community, initiation procedures, pan-theon of deities, ritual activities, and ceremonial performances. It canonly be hoped that the cultural and sociopolitical conditions favor-ing such research continue to blossom.iv)Introduction to Part Three: the mountain deities of the spirit-mediumsIn this part of the book, through Tibetan textual sources, I closelyexamine the character and functions of the divine mountains onwhich the spirit-mediums rely. This permits one to gain a fullerappreciation of how these mountain deities generally inform religiouslife in Upper Tibet, providing a historical and cultural context for"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"38part onethelha-pavocation. As shown, due to entwined processes of culturaldevelopment, the customs and practices of the spirit-mediums, andthose contained in the literary record for sacred mountains and lakesshare many fundamental themes in common. These functionalcrossovers between the lha-paand the texts make it appropriate tospeak of a single tradition of native divinities with oral and literarycomponents. In some instances, it would appear that ancient oraltraditions served as the inspiration and basis for the subsequent devel-opment of the literary tradition. The cult of indigenous deities ispredicated on the premise that a line of communication is openbetween humans and sacred topographs. In essence, the traditionholds that the mountains and lakes are sentient and affect one’s lifeand fortune just as other members of society do.As we have seen, there are six principal mountain deities used bythelha-paof Upper Tibet: gNyan-chen thang-lha, rTa-rgo, Gangs-ri lha-btsan, Nam-ra, Rol-pa skya-bdun, and Dam-can mgar-ba nag-po. These six mountain deities are among the most powerful andwidely distributed yul-lhain Upper Tibet, with their influence, in oneform or another, being felt over the entire 700,000-square kilo-meter region. Their role in the religious and cultural life of theinhabitants of the region is vibrant and compelling, and takes fiveprincipal forms:1) Embodiments of Buddhist and Bon tenets.2) Territorial defender gods.3) Clan, family and personal protective deities.4) Objects of pilgrimage and geographic lore.5) The focus of spirit-mediumship.First and foremost, these mountain deities are potent guardians thatprotect the interests of individuals, communities, livestock, the envi-ronment, and religion. Their place in local culture is therefore, ubiq-uitous and the course of their activities immediate and very tangible.As noted in the general introduction, nowhere more than in thework of the lha-paare the indigenous deities alive and present. Thisintimacy is reflected in the texts we will examine, where the godsare directly called upon—in the present tense—to provide protec-tion, mental well being and social prestige for the officiants of thevarious rituals and their clients. Tibetan literary sources also encap-sulate the lha-pa’sview of the etiology of disease and misfortune, and"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"general orientation39the manner in which they are to be prevented and treated. The rit-ual paraphernalia, ceremonial structures and invocations used by thelha-paare also represented in the texts selected for translation. Thesecommonalties delineate what is generally referred to as the ‘Tibetanmountain cult,’ an integral part of Tibetan religion both past andpresent.The oral and literary aspects of tradition agree that the mountaindeities have a wrathful side to their personalities. Although they alsoact as pacific deities, their fierce nature is often paramount. Tibetansperceive this ferocity as being expressed in terms of the destructiveside of natural forces as in violent storms, earthquakes, droughts,epidemics, etc. As local participants in natural processes, the moun-tain deities are closely allied with both the good and bad that resultfrom them. A second reason often cited by Tibetans for the wrath-ful predisposition of the mountain gods is that it is essential for thedomination of disease-causing, harm-engendering elemental spirits,who attack human beings with great persistence and regularity. Themountain gods also rule over the plants and animals in their locale,which serve as instruments for their largesse or devastation. Thespirit-mediums have a penetrating understanding of the function ofthe indigenous pantheon in Tibetan society and use it to serve theirpatients and clients. By doing so they become peacemakers, medi-ating between the danger and capriciousness of the preternaturalenvironment (the world of spirits) and the needs and aspirations ofhuman beings. Other religious functionaries (such as monks andsngags-pa) also fulfill this mediation role, as delineated in the text-based rituals we will examine.A word on the texts I have chosen for translation is in order. Therange of texts for the worship and ritual dispensation of the moun-tain deities that participate in trance ceremonies of Upper Tibet iswide. They include the following literary genres: bsangs/bsangs-gsol(incense and purification offerings),gser-skyems(libation offerings),gsol’debs(prayers and petitions to deities), dkar-chag(registers of sacredplaces and associated historical events), g.yang ’gugs(fortune-attractionrituals),mdos(enticements and coercion mechanisms), bskul-paandgsol-kha(invocations and associated requests), and bskang-ba/bskang-gso(offerings for appeasement and expiation). Wherever possible, I havepreferred to use Bon texts because they are partially derived fromindigenous or non-Buddhist religious tradition, which may have existed in precursory forms prior to Buddhism. Moreover, it is the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"40part oneBon tradition that claims as its own the origin of thelha-pa.Spirit-mediums are thought to have been active in Zhang-zhung times,long predating Gu-ru rin-po-che, the founder of spirit-mediumshipin the Buddhist tradition (see Part Four, section i). In particular, thetexts that have been selected adequately describe the appearance,attributes and activities of the mountain gods, and the ritual per-formances associated with them, which find resonance with the beliefsand practices of the lha-pa.The texts surveyed in this work broadly reflect the stylistic devel-opment of the liturgies for the indigenous pantheon (deities weddedto the Tibetan landscape). Three interrelated phases of stylistic pro-gression that span the transition from non-lamaist (non-ecclesiastic)to lamaist (ecclesiastic) religious forms are discernable in the literarytradition, and are noted in various introductions to the texts pre-sented in this part of the book. The initiation of these phases of lit-erary development may correspond with the historical progressionfrom pre-Buddhist to Buddhist culture but this cannot be determinedwith the evidence at hand. It is also important to note that in morerecent centuries, there are instances of ritual texts composed in allthree stylistic phases of the liturgical tradition and therefore, this sys-tem of classification cannot be used to gauge the chronology of indi-vidual works.In their non-lamaist configuration (what may be the earliest style),the liturgies do not admit of Buddhist tradition. They are charac-terized by highly colored dynamic verses drawn from indigenous cul-ture, which are infused by a distinctive system of meter and assonance(see Part Three, section i, pp. 183, 184). This elementary phase ofprosody in ritual literature seems to owe its inspiration to the tra-dition of bards (sgrung-pa/sgrung-mkhan/bka’ sgrung), who orally trans-mitted the invocations for the mountain divinities and other nativelore from generation to generation. The intermediate stylistic phaseof ritual literature is characterized by Bon and Buddhist doctrinalinfiltration into the indigenous poetry, as a means of nominally claim-ing it as a legitimate channel of religious expression. While many ofthe indigenous poetical conventions remain intact, they are oftenbracketed by passages that elevate the deities to the status of highBon and Buddhist protectors, partially dislodging them from theirgeographic context. The third stylistic phase of ritual literature is thethorough transformation of the verses into a Bon or Buddhist reli-gious statement, with a consequent atrophying of indigenous tradi-tion. This lamaist interpenetration of content primarily relates to"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"general orientation41canonical doctrines, iconography, mental imagery and mantras. Inwhat may be the most recent stylistic phase, the liturgies retain verylittle of the lore, vocabulary and prosody of the indigenous litera-ture. The deities are further pried away from their geographic moor-ings and made to reside in Buddhist ontological categories.40The textual and oral components of tradition regarding sacredmountains have much in common, for they are both derived fromBuddhist praxis as well as Tibet’s native cultural milieu. Bon leg-endary sources in general unambiguously attribute the wellspring ofnative tradition to pre-Imperial times, when the customs and litur-gies for the indigenous pantheon are thought to have developedunder the auspices of the Bon religion, particularly in the kingdomof Zhang-zhung.41Despite the uncritical nature of Bon chronologi-cal attributions, the antiquity of certain descriptive motifs, lexical 40The geographical detachment of indigenous deities from the lamacized rites ofthelha-bonritualists of southern Glo (Mustang) is studied in Ramble 1998. The lha-bonrecitations are particularly pertinent to understanding the transition between theelementary stylistic phase and the Buddhist-inspired phases of oral literature, as theymay reveal the first glimmerings of lamaist tradition. The process of Buddhacizationin peripheral Tibetan cultural regions is ongoing, mirroring historical changes thatappear to have occurred in Upper Tibet over a wider period of time.41There certainly is no scholarly consensus on whether pre-Imperial traditioncan be equated with an early form of the institutionalized Bon religion. In theabsence of the requisite scientific and philological data, the debate over the antiq-uity of the Bon religion and the degree of historical continuity it exhibits will con-tinue to rage. The complexity of the subject and the methodological problems itraises are not easily grappled with. In any analysis of historical continuity as per-tains to ritual tradition it is essential to define the cultural arena in which such aphenomenon potentially expresses itself. Briefly stated, there are three major areasthat must be considered here: 1) The continuity of specific ritual activities and litur-gies; 2) continuity of the symbolic and semantic systems that invest ritual with mean-ing; and 3) continuity in the social, economic and physical environments in whichthe rituals operate. Furthermore, there are two main ways in which continuities inritual traditions potentially express themselves in extant oral and literary records:As relics (traditions transmitted in an unmodified form) and as reformulations (tra-ditions adapted to later cultural and social influences). There is a considerable bodyof scholarly opinion that places the genesis of the systematized Bon religion at theend of the Tenth century. Countervailing voices see demonstrable cultural lines ofcontinuity in Bon extending back to the Imperial period Tun-huang manuscripts.It has been shown that certain Bon ritual texts are closely related to the Tun-huangliterary tradition, indicating that the post-11th century Bon religion preserved thecontent and style of literary composition prevalent in the Imperial period (Karmayand Nagano 2002: viii). For examples of these literary parallels see Karmay 1998;Stein 2003. Stein notes (2003: 597, 598, 608) that Bon-po authors must have hadidentical or comparable texts to the Tun-huang manuscripts, creating an unbrokenliterary or oral tradition. A third school of thought, as propounded by the idealisticnativists, perceives the Bon religion as originating in an essentially complete and ossifiedform deep in prehistory. This latter view is the one frequently upheld by Bon clerics."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"42part onefeatures and syntactical components of the rites of propitiation forthe native divinities is implied by their antediluvian character. Never-theless, the tools for evincing any objective antiquity remain beyondour grasp, as the historical, ethnological and archaeological dataneeded for quantification are not yet at our disposal. At this junc-ture in Tibetological studies, we lack the scientific means to addressfundamental questions regarding the origins, chronology and advance-ment of indigenous tradition. What we can confidently state is thatmany of the rituals featured in this work do contain strands of non-Buddhist lore, which in the Bon tradition have their origin in thefabled pre-Imperial epoch.In consonance with this Bon affirmation of antiquity and the UpperTibet endemical quality of the literary materials contained herein, Iadvance the hypothesis that there are indeed vestigial cultural ele-ments within them that originate from a heterogeneous corpus ofpre-Imperial tradition. This hypothetical early cultural endowmentis primarily oriented towards the Tibetan natural environment andthe appropriation of its physical resources. The bulk of grammar,syntax, terminology, and orthography used in the Bon ritual textshowever, are unquestionably part of a literary tradition post-datingthe creation of the Tun-huang manuscripts in the Eighth to Tenthcenturies. This demonstrates that even if the cult of protective deitiesis atavistic in nature, it underwent substantial modification—in accor-dance with historical, cultural and linguistic developments—in orderto assume its present configuration only after the Tenth century.In order to elicit further discussion and inquiry into the crucialsubject of pre-Imperial remnant traditions in Upper Tibet, I willpropose hypothetical chronological parameters based on my archaeo-logical observations. It can be cogently argued that at least some ofwhat survives of the native heritage represents relict Iron Age cul-tural traditions, which prevailed in Upper Tibet as late as the Seventhcentury. Scant archaeological evidence suggests that the Iron Agecontinued as an anachronistic cultural and political system in Tibetuntil the onset of the Imperial period, in the early Seventh century(Bellezza 2002a). There are two major factors in my opinion thatwarrant not assigning the earliest layer of ritual traditions to the pos-terior Imperial period. First of all, to do so would be to postulatethat archaic tradition, as represented in certain Tun-huang manu-scripts (such asPT 1038, PT 1042, PT 1068, PT 1134, PT 1136,etc.) and early epigraphic sources (as well as later cognate sources)"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"general orientation43arose in a virtual historical vacuum. I think this very unlikely becausethe highly evolved cultural systems, which are reflected in variousrituals for the propitiation of the indigenous pantheon and the funer-ary rites of high status individuals in the Tun-huang manuscripts,seem to be the product of long-standing tradition.42Such complex42More recent cultural importations notwithstanding. The antiquity of certainTibetan funerary rituals is explicitly stated in two of the Tun-huang manuscripts.These passages seem to indicate that special funerary practices were already veryold by the Imperial period but their semantic and historical significance is verydifficult to judge. The rituals under investigation are found in the context of thosewho died in the most tragic circumstances and were composed to illustrate theirefficacy in any circumstances (I have worked extensively on Tun-huang funerarytexts and Bon funerary ritual cycles and will present my findings in the textual sec-tion of my next book on the pre-Buddhist archaeology of Upper Tibet, which shallbe entitled Antiquities of High Tibet). The relevant passages are concerned with theuse of do-ma(live sacrificial horses) and sacrificial yaks, and claim that these funer-ary customs were already ancient by the time they were written down. Based onarchaeological evidence, this may well be the case because the bones and horns ofungulates are regularly excavated at grave sites throughout the Tibetan Plateau,encompassing all chronologies from the Neolithic through the Imperial period. Atleast in some instances these osteological remains appear to have been part of funer-ary ritual offerings. Belonging to the early corpus of Tun-huang manuscripts (basedon the style of calligraphy, content and grammatical structure these texts are of theEighth or Ninth century?), Pelliot 1136(lns. 30–60) relates how two captured sacredhorses (do-ma) were employed by gshenritualists to redeem a girl named lCam-lhorgyal byang-mo who died by suicide. Before her death she had become very depressedat the prospect of marriage to the lord of Zhang-zhung gu-ge. At the very end ofthe account we find: “In ancient times [the do-ma] was beneficial also, now it isbeneficial. In ancient times [the do-ma] was meritorious also, now it is meritorious.”(...gna’ phan da yang phan gna’ bsod da yang bsod do/). These lines can possibly beread as an aspirational prayer but this seems a less likely intention of their mean-ing: “May [the do-ma] also now be beneficial as it was beneficial in ancient times.May the [do-ma] also now be meritorious as it was meritorious in ancient times.”InPelliot 1068we encounter the same type of passage. It is tagged on to the endof an account about the value of a sacrificialmdzo-mo(female hybrid yak) in theshid(funeral) of a sister (lns. 53–60). Earlier in the text, we learn that the sisterdied a wretched death in a pigsty among the waste (pag-brun) while her brotherwas away hunting game. She had been terribly neglected by her stepmother (ma-g.yar). The end of the account states: “As it was beneficial in ancient times, it isalso now beneficial. As it was meritorious in ancient times, it is also now merito-rious.” (. . .gna’ phan na da yang phano gna’ bsod na da yang bsod do/). These lines canalso be read as an aspirational prayer but this is a less likely translation given theirgrammatical structure. Despite the seemingly explicit nature of the Tun-huang pas-sages and what may be supporting archaeological evidence, their precise antiquityremains open to question. This uncertainty is due to the abstruse historical intri-cacies and methodological problems involved in gauging the antiquity of ritual tra-dition. Firstly, there may be some who would argue that the passages presentedabove are merely a literary contrivance to lend the Tun-huang rituals historicaldepth and legitimacy. I think it more plausible however, that these passages assert-ing the antiquity of the funerary rituals or components of the rituals found therein"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"44part oneanthropological phenomena as elaborate funerary practices, mytholo-gies and rituals for indigenous deities usually require a good deal oftime to endogenously innovate or successfully import. Also, the diffusebody of early tradition does not have a definite historic genesis, noris it representative of an individual founder or singular religion, whichis often the case with ancient legacies. If the origins of early tradi-tion were contemporaneous with the Imperial period (as TibetanBuddhism largely was), it seems to me that there should be definitehistorical indications to that effect in the Tun-huang manuscriptsand other archaic Tibetan literature.A second factor suggesting to me that the roots of early indige-nous traditions existed before the Imperial period has to do with theostensible temporal continuity exhibited by material constituents ofUpper Tibet culture. Cultural links between the pre-Buddhist andBuddhist periods are indicated in both the rock art record and var-ious monumental forms of Upper Tibet (Bellezza 2001; 2002a).Although these archaeological assets largely remain undated, thereis architectural and settlement evidence implying that they were cre-ated not only as part of the archaic cultural substratum but in thehistoric period (as late as the 12th century?) as well. The rdo-khang(all-stone residences) at Mount Ti-se are an excellent case in point(Bellezza 2002a: 62–75). As my extensive work on the subject shows,there are also substantial figurative and symbolic rock art depictionsthat appear to have been produced in both the pre-Buddhist andBuddhist periods, which have much compositional cohesion (such asthe hunting of wild herbivores, bi-triangular animal forms, raptorswith outstretched wings, swastikas, etc.). The same general culturalpattern of pertinacity is also discernable in the motifs of copper alloycan be taken quite literally and reflect tradition established well before the Tenthcentury. The word gna’ bo (ancient time) in Bon ritual tradition generally refers toevents that are believed to have occurred centuries if not millennia ago, but per-haps such a liberal interpretation of the passages is unwarranted here? In the fourthquarter of the Eighth century, Tibet appears to have undergone cultural upheavalwith the state-sponsored prosecution of Bon, and in the mid-Ninth century theimperium collapsed. It is therefore conceivable that ancient in the context of thepassages merely refers to events that took place before the late Eighth century, ina cultural and political environment so different as to qualify in the authors’ mindas ancient. Yet, even if the passages are taken on their word as reflecting longestablished funerary tradition this still begs the question; what is actually ancient:the ritual in its entirety, specific liturgical or symbolic elements of the ritual, or sim-ply the diffuse tradition (the non-specific connection of such burial rites to those ofpre-Imperial times)?"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"general orientation45artifacts of the thog-lcagsclass. Likewise, it appears that all-stone cor-belled fortresses and religious edifices and funerary pillar monumentspersisted from deep in the pre-Imperial period43until historical times.These possible prominent anachronisms in the material culture sug-gest in themselves that historic Upper Tibet preserved paleoculturaltraditions to a significant degree. If indeed my hypotheses of anunbroken chronological progression in the creation of monuments,rock art and small metallic objects is correct, we can presuppose thatthe same holds true for certain forms of intangible culture. That isto say, a prehistoric-historic material culture continuum must per-force have correspondences in the abstract cultural record of UpperTibet. A corollary of my hypotheses suggesting long-standing cul-tural continuity is that the oldest aspects of the corpus of indigenousritual traditions predate the early historic period in Tibet. While thisview cannot be scientifically verified, surely the development of anelaborate network of ancient monuments in Upper Tibet cannot butreflect the existence of a commensurate ideational fabric in the soci-ety that founded them.Are we then to accept conventional Bon claims that their religionis 18,000 years old? I think not in any literal sense. The habitualusage of iron (lcags) implements and technologies by the deities ofthe rituals and the ancient officiants themselves seems to indicatethat most, if not all, of the potentially pre-Imperial relict materialarose from traditions no more ancient than the developed TibetanIron Age.44Cross-cultural archaeological comparisons with India,China and Mongolia suggest that the Iron Age did not become firmlyentrenched in Tibet until the middle or late First Millennium BC(Bellezza 2002a). It can therefore, be inferred that the routine citation43Foot tarsals extracted from a tomb located between two funerary pillar com-plexes at Khang-dmar, sGer-rtse county, provide the oldest calibrated dates for anUpper Tibet archaeological asset yet obtained. These bones have yielded a con-ventional radiocarbon age of 2740 +/– 40 years before present. Details of this andother radiocarbon analyses will feature in my forthcoming work on the archaeol-ogy of Upper Tibet.44I do not negate the possibility that some Iron Age features are, in fact, rep-resentative of reconfigured earlier traditions, but these may not be discernable inextant literary and ethnographic materials. A potential example could be the Eneolithicuse of naturally occurring gold, silver and meteoric iron for ornamentation. Thisat least is the paleocultural pattern found among the Afanasevo culture of theMinusinsk Basin of the end of the Third Millennium and beginning of the SecondMillennium BC (Okladnikov 1990: 79, 80)."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"46part oneof iron instruments as attributes of deities and as offering articles,and associated vestigial ritual traditions surrounding the cult of indige-nous deities, sprung up no earlier than the Iron Age, a maximumof 1200 years before the first diffusion of Buddhism into Tibet.45This possible Iron Age antiquity, as reflected in themes found in thetexts under examination, is insinuated by the following general cul-tural traits of Eurasian societies in the Iron Age:1) The widespread currency of the element iron as a metaphor forpower and as an esteemed attribute of material objects.2) The existence of a priestly class closely allied with the rulingclass, which was involved in the placation and exploitation ofnatural forces.3) The extensive use of wild carnivores and raptors as religious andpolitical power symbols.4) The employment of elaborate magic and divination rituals inwhich animal sacrifice and animal parts played an important role.5) The highly elevated status of the riding horse, and its participa-tion in various religious observances.6) The dominant martial and warlike bearing of elite social facetsof the population, including the priesthood.45Providing that it is actually old enough, I maintain that indigenous ritual mate-rial may also belie a paleoclimatic bias. The long list of proscriptions associatedwith the environment-bound pantheon and the brutal eagerness of these deities topunish those who transgress the indigenous ecological sanctions can possibly berelated to the pronounced deterioration in Tibet’s climate. These negative envi-ronmental changes intensified in the First Millennium BC with the onset of theLate Holocene. The increasingly difficult environmental conditions could have hada considerable impact on the way in which the personalities of the mountain andlake deities were perceived by those who petitioned them. As they dispensed lessand less of their life-giving boons, their capricious and dangerous aspects may havebeen reinforced, thus playing a formative role in the way in which the cult ofindigenous protective deities evolved in Tibet. I hold however, that an even largerimpetus for the mercenary and strident tone of the ritual language for wrathfuldeities may have been Imperial period sectarian rivalries between Buddhists andthe adherents of pre-Imperial religious traditions. Conceivably, it is in such cir-cumstances that the most ferocious litanies developed, to be preserved in post-Tenthcentury Bon liturgies.

The account of thesubjugation of the Tibetan people and deities pronounces the Bonidentity and antiquity of the indigenous pantheon. Nevertheless, thistheme closely parallels that found in the Buddhist Lha ’dre bka’ thangof Gu-ru rin-po-che, set in the Eighth century. Save for the namesof indigenous mountain gods and classes of deities, the myth con-tains no demonstrable archaic lore. A lively version of the Bon taleset at Mount Ti-se (Gangs rin-po-che), in Zhang-zhung, is found inthe well-known 19th century pilgrimage guide Ti se’i dkar chag.46Itis difficult to judge how much of this account was derived from ear-lier sources and how much of it represents a 19th century attemptat reclaiming or fabricating a Bon pre-Imperial heritage. Be that asit may, thisTi se’i dkar chagexcerpt furnishes a clear doctrinal indi-cation of how autochthonous mountain and other environment-baseddeities are thought to have been incorporated into the Bon pantheon.In addition to subduing the Tibetans and their indigenous pan-theon, other nations belonging to the eighteen great countries (yul-chen bco-brgyad) were brought under control by gShen-rab and boundto an oath to uphold the Bon bstan-pa(doctrine). According to theTi se’i dkar chag, the bduddemons, accompanied by the Tibetan tribesliving southeast of Lhasa and their allies from other countries, crossedinto Zhang-zhung from the northwestern land of sTag-gzig (para i).In order to meet them, gShen-rab and his disciples descended toTi-se armed with omnipotent powers of meditation (paras ii, iii). Thethree greatest mountain deities of Tibet, Ti-se, gNyan-chen thang-lha and Pom-ra and the large circle of female deities (smanandbrtan-ma) sent horrific spectacles against gShen-rab—but they were nomatch for him and were easily defeated (para iv). Thus subdued,the indigenous pantheon and people of Tibet and adjoining coun-tries were bound to the Bon religious oath (paras v, vi). gShen-rabthen ordered that the indigenous pantheon protect and serve thepeople and their religion:46’Dzam gling gangs rgyal ti se’i dkar chag tshangs dbyangs yid phrog, by dKar-ru grub-dbang bstan ’dzin (born 1801), (mDzod phug rtsa ba dang spyi don dang gangs ti se’i dkarchag, nos. 491–657), nos. 556, ln. 3 to 559, ln. 3."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"48part one(i ) [sTon-pa gShen-rab] conquered the innumerable worlds (stong-gsum)and established the happiness [of the beings] of the khams-gsum(threeworlds).

In the Bon tradi-tion, spirit-mediumship is categorized as a form of divination foundin the Phya-gshen vehicle, the first of nine systems of teachings. Aswe shall see, Bon tradition alleges that the srid-pa’i sgra-blawere oneclass of possessing deities in pre-Imperial times. This part of the bookbegins with an exposition of spirit-mediumship in the Bon tradition(lha yi bka’ bab) in which its legendary and liturgical roles in the Phya-gshen vehicle are delineated. The central figure in the Phya-gshenclassification of divination is Phu-wer, an ancient pacific deity. Thethree texts available for Phu-wer are scrutinized in section ii, in orderto compare and contrast analogous rituals employed by the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet. These texts show that the appearance,function and offerings regimen of this god are not unlike those ofthelha-ri.Through a variety of textual passages, the liturgies, functions andcosmogonic roles of the srid-pa’i sgra-blawill also be analyzed in sec-tion iii. The textual translations provided show that despite the srid-pa’i sgra-blahaving a higher status in Bon doctrinal reckonings, theybear much resemblance to the mountain deities. The comprehen-sive comparison of the srid-pa’i sgra-blaand mountain gods compiledin this section of the book reveal many striking similarities betweenthe deities of spirit-mediumship in the Bon and lha-patraditions.Although Bon differentiates the srid-pa’i sgra-blaand pantheon of evi-ronment bound spirits as higher and worldly deities respectively,manifold interconnections suggest that both classes of deities arederived from the same historical wellspring of tradition.Positing a historical interrelationship between the srid-pa’i sgra-blaandlha-riin the face of doctrinal distinctions in status that havearisen over the course of Bon literary tradition, readily admits oftwo hypotheses. One such hypothesis maintains that the srid-pa’i sgra-blawere the product of the indigenous pantheon (deities geograph-ically bound to the Tibetan physical environment) coming underImperial period Buddhist influence. This led to the ambit of div-ination rites, protective rituals and clan traditions being divested from‘worldly deities’ such as the lha-riand installed in this more supe-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"general orientation51rior group of divinities. The other historical hypothesis is only per-missible if we are prepared to entertain the Bon contention that thesrid-pa’i sgra-blawere indeed part of their pre-Imperial religious tra-dition. This hypothesis holds that the srid-pa’i sgra-bla, as well as otherBon protective deities covered in this work (Hur-pa, Mi-bdud andYum-sras), were partly shorn of their mountain and lake identitiesto create a new class of deities as part of changes in religious cul-ture, which occurred in the pre-Seventh century Iron Age. Thesespeculative historical scenarios raise intriguing and important ques-tions relating to the cultural development of Upper Tibet. Perhapsarchaeological investigations will eventually put to rest such ques-tions concerning the historical validity of Bon’s early pantheon.vi)Introduction to Part Five: Bon literary references to the ritual implementsand practices of the spirit-mediumsIn this final part of the book, we examine textual sources that shedlight upon the implements and techniques used by the spirit-mediumsof Upper Tibet. The placement of the tradition of spirit-mediumshipin the Bon Phya-gshen vehicle appears to be reflected in the antiq-uity of the possessing deities, and in the ceremonial paraphernaliaand activities of the trance. Like the native divinities, the materialobjects and ritual techniques that endow the trance ceremony withits characteristic form are surrounded by a mythic mantle of greatage. Through religious mythology and legendary early practitioners,Bon texts clearly identify the ceremonial elements of spirit-medi-umship with the pre-Imperial cultural milieu. In Bon historico-ritualnotions objects such as the gshang, drum and arrow, as well as theritual techniques of fumigation, lustration, exorcistic missiles and for-tune-summoning are often attributed to Zhang-zhung masters anddeities. There may be a degree of historical validity to some of theseclaims in that archaeological evidence indicates that copper alloy me-longand arrowheads are instruments with a very long history inTibet.The manner of usage of the ritual instruments and their apotropaicand fortune-bestowing functions in Bon literature parallels their appli-cation in the trance ceremony of the spirit-mediums.

He reportsbeing initiated as a spirit-medium at around 20 years of age by theprevious reincarnation of the sTag-lung bka’ brgyud lama rMa-sprulrin-po-che.3According to the bsTan-grag lha-pa, he is one of onlytwo or three elderly spirit-mediums left on the south side of gNyan-chen thang-lha, in the ’Dam and Yangs-pa-can region.4It thereforeappears that the tradition of spirit-mediumship is on the verge ofextinction in these locales, as it is in much of northern and westernTibet.bsTan-grag lha-pa declares that he is a medium for three of themost important chos-skyong(religious protectors) of the bKa’ brgyudsubsect, sTag lung: dGe-bsnyen (Householder Vows One), g.Ya’ dmar(Red Slate), and bDud-btsan.

In the pre-Communist period, the center of the administrativedistrict of sNying-drung (old name: gNyan-grong) was a local fort called sBas-tshangrdzong, headed by a rdzong-dpon(district officer). The district was divided into ninecamps (gNyan-grong sger-gzhung dgu), which were owned by various ’Bras-spungsmonastery colleges, government departments and aristocrats. Although sNying-drungis now part of ’Dam-gzhung county, in the pre-Communist period the eight campsof ’Dam (’Dam-brgya shog-brgyad) constituted a separate administrative entity.3This is the incarnate lama Thub-btsan ’jigs-med chos-mchog (1916–1975).4In addition to the bsTan-grag lha-pa, there was a dpa’ mo(female spirit-medium)of advanced age in sNying-drung township.

Due to bsTan-grag lha-pa’s intimate associa-tion with the sTag-lung protectors, his religious status is thought tobe much higher than those lha-pathat only channeled the com-monplace ‘worldly’ spirits. Both sTag-lung lamas and laymen I havespoken to seem to share this notion of his prestige.bsTan-grag lha-pa reports also being a medium for rDo-rje rkyang-khra (Adamantine Varied Colored Onager), a btsanclass protectordeity of the erstwhile gNam-ru district. bsTan-grag lha-pa notes that5It appears that the inclusion of these deities in the healing practices of bsTan-grag lha-pa had the effect of strengthening the religious and social links betweenthe community and the sTag-lung subsect. Hardly esoteric guardians ensconced in monasteries, in the context of spirit-mediumship, the sTag-lung protectors werevisibly manifest, and seen as instrumental in the health and well-being of the community.6A-pha’i lha(father’s god) is a popular term for a family protective deity foundthroughout Upper Tibet and Khams, which regulate the phywa-g.yang(modalities forgood fortune) of a family. My research shows that in the Byang-thang they areoften synonymous with thephugs-lha(according to the ’brog-pa, the word phugsmeans‘innermost’ and refers to one’s direct ancestors), and are also equated with the pho-lha(personal deity of males) and the khyim-lha(household deity). However, in aninvocatory text found in the Lha bsangs rgyags brnganritual cycle, the phug-lha(differentspelling) are referred to in the female gender (Namkhai Norbu 1995: 73, 74, 251),thus in this context they closely correspond to the mo-lha(personal deity of females).A-pha’i lhais also frequently synonymous with the pha-mes-lha(patriline guardiandeity) and the rus-lha/rus-rgyud-lha/rus-pa’i lha/gdung-rgyud-lha(clan protective deity) ofearlier times however, it would appear that at one time these represented separatetypes of deities. In the sNying-drung, ’Dam and gNam-mtsho regions the A-pha’ilhaare frequently sTag-lung and ’Bri-gung bka’ brgyud subsect bstan-srung(protec-tors of Buddhism). It appears that these bKa’ brgyud protectors were adopted asA-pha’i lhato help strengthen the social, political and economic bonds between thelay and monastic communities. While in some cases, these deities may have playeda role in the origin myths of certain clans, such beliefs are no longer well articu-lated. Rather than symbols of genealogical origination or ancestral deistic relation-ships, these spirits now serve a protective role for individual households and assymbols of kinship. A-pha’i lhalive in the home or tent and where they exist theirrten(support or residence) is often amda’ dar(arrow festooned with colored ribbons,a small metal mirror and cowry shells), a fortune-bestowing instrument.

After recovering King Nyi-ma ’brug-sgrags’ body atChu-rgyud rgyal-po’i lha-kha, a place above Lhasa, his subjects carried it back toMe-chen on a bier via the ’Phen-po sgo-la, Chag-la (so named because the bierbroke here) and ’Drud-la (called such because the King’s corpse was pulled overit). At the King’s cremation ceremony his mother discovered that there had beena plot against her son. This she did by observing the reaction of the King’s sub-jects: they expressed remorse for having murdered him only after witnessing whitesmoke going straight into the sky from his pyre, a sign that he was about to achieveenlightenment. Nonetheless, the mother beseeched her dead son to return and exacthis revenge. The white smoke returned to the cremation grounds, and the rnam-shes(consciousness) of the dead king remained there for seven days. Consequently,thernam-shestook a wrong turn and was reborn as the malevolent spirit Me-khe.It commenced to slay all those who conspired against King Nyi-ma ’brug-grags, aswell as many others, and retained them as his spirit servants. When the first sTag-lung hierarch sTag-lung thang-pa bkra-shis-dpal (born 1142) learned about theseevents, he brought Me-khe and his retinue under an oath to uphold the Buddhistdoctrines, and made him his special protector. He has remained a bstan-srung(pro-tector of the sTag-lung lineage and doctrine) since that time. Me-khe wears a redturban, black dress and the flayed skin of a human. In his right hand he holds ablack spear and banner, and in his left a triangular red gtor-ma(offering sculpture).His mount is a black horse"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"58part twoAs we have seen, the three chief sTag-lung protective deities, dGe-bsnyen, g.Ya’ dmar and bDud-btsan, are very important to bsTan-grag lha-pa and his mediumship activities. In sTag-lung tradition,their origin is attributed to the death of an individual named Thang-lha ’bar-ba in the late 12th century. The patronage of the sTag-lung, the founder of the subsect, and their special protective deitiesare all traced to three branches of the Ga-zi clan. According to thesTag-lung-pa, the protector dGe-bsnyen is said to have appearedfrom the corpse of Thang-lha ’bar-ba, while g.Ya’ dmar and bDud-btsan and six other protectors, along with their vast circles of spir-its, arose from eight droplets of blood that fell from the corpse.Recently, a small history of these protectors was authored by thesTag-lung bka’ brgyud monk bsTan ’dzin kun-dga’ entitled TheUnfolded History of the Splendid Tiger Country bKa’ brgyud Protector of theDoctrine dGe-bsnyen).11This text is mainly derived from the oral accountsof elderly sTag-lung monks, but other sources of information includethe religious history sTag-lung chos ’byungand the invocatory texts fordGe-bsnyen. Original textual sources for the history of the sTag-lungprotectors reportedly were lost in the Chinese Cultural Revolution.The mountain deities and other indigenous protectors trace theirorigins to the primordial past, or the beginning of the world, andare therefore often referred to in Tibetan literature as srid-pa’i-lha(deities of existence). On the other hand, the sTag-lung protectors—as well as certain other Buddhist protectors—have a historical theogonyand are attributed to the often violent social events that occurred.In the case of dGe-bsnyen and associated sTag-lung protectors, their11dPal stag lung bka’ brgyud kyi bka’ srung dge bsnyen byung rim.

I apologize in front of the TripleGems and the ocean of oath-holding [deities], and especially to the all-protecting,adamantine defenders of the [sTag-lung] doctrine for whatever mistakes I havemade.” (grwa rgan rabs rnams kyis gsung kyi ’dug par / rgyab rten tshad ma dang khung lungji yod mi shes kyang rang gis thos pa rnams gang dran bris pa yin / nor ’khrul nyes tshogs cimchis / mchog gsum dam can rgya mtsho dang / lhag par bka’ srung rdo rje kun skyobs kyispyan snga ru mthol lo bshags /).

The protagonist of the story, Thang-lha ’bar-ba, is killedby the yul-lhaof sTag-lung char-rje because of his terrible huntingexcesses;12yet because in his previous life he was a member of thepious Ga-zi clan, his death was to bring much benefit to sentientbeings.In the history of the sTag-lung protectors, theyul-lhaChar-rje isclearly a deity that predates dGe-bsnyen. The archaic appellationsof the other members of his entourage also indicate antecedent ori-gins. These figures seem to represent pre-existing deities or deitiesthat were recast and brought into the sTag-lung doctrinal fold aroundthe time of the founding of the subsect. For example, the well-knowngod rDo-rje-legs-pa,13existed during the bstan-pa snga-dar (first diffusionof Buddhism (para ix),14several hundred years before the foundingof the sTag-lung-pa. Also in the sTag-lung circle is Lha-btsan ne-ragnyen-po, whose name includes the word ne-ra(para ix), which seemsto mean flower in the Zhang-zhung language. Another example ofindigenous lore being incorporated by the Buddhist protectors iswhere Thang-lha ’bar-ba asks to be reborn as a srid-pa’i lha-chen-po(great god of existence) (para vi). The large circle of carnivorous ani-mals in the retinues of dGe-bsnyen and his cohorts (para ix) is yetanother feature that seems to be derived form native tradition.In the history of the sTag-lung protectors presented here we cansee the way in which these gods were created, and how they takeprecedence over what appear to be pre-existing indigenous deities.Murdered humans brought into the Buddhist pantheon—as in themi-shi btsan-skyes(death of a person, birth of a btsan) phenomenon—was to become a popular religious theme during the period of dGe-lugs-pa ascendancy. However, the motives involved in the creationof these spirits were usually less noble than the circumstances sur-rounding the birth of the sTag-lung protectors. In any event, these12The female state oracle Blo-bzang tshe-sgron was a medium for a patron of’Bras-spungs monastery called dPa’ bo, who likewise had been killed by a localdeity, a bstan-magoddess (Havnevik 2002: 268–270).13For more lore about this deity see Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956, pp. 155–159; PartThree, Section vii.14In this text, as in all other Tibetan texts presented for translation in this work,I have arranged the sequence of paragraphs according to content.

The origin ofdGe-bsnyen, a prototype for this class of deity, is written as follows:(i) Among the six [great] clans of the Tibetans the dBra is represented.Among the [dBra] is the clan of Ga-zi from which the one known asYon-ched bzang-po was born. He had three sons. His oldest son was’Dod-na des-khyer, his middle son dGra-mig sa ’debs, and the youngestson was Glan-kha phar-bsko. The eldest of the lineage ’Dod-na des-khyer begot Ga-zi shàkya bzang-po and he became the great leaderof mDo-khams (eastern Tibet). Thereafter, until the present day, [hisfamily] known as mDo-mkha’ rag-kha-shar gzim-shag became the spon-sors of the doctrine of the sTag-lung bka’ brgyud. Members of thisunbroken lineage are still doing the sponsorship of the sTag-lung [pa].(ii) In the lineage of the middle son, dGra-mig sa ’debs, was born theglorious precious one sTag-lung thang-pa bkra-shis (in more recenttimes local people have called him Bal-blon ’bar-po). He presentedhimself respectfully to ’Gro-mgon (Protector of Living Beings) Phag-mo gru-pa, and fully mastered the stages of wisdom and the paths ofenlightenment.15Afterwards, he founded sTag-lung monastery, and bypropagating the monastic disciplinary traditions, the bKa’ brgyudBuddhist doctrine was spread.(iii) The youngest brother Glan-kha phar-bsko was not long lived. Afterhis death, in ’Bro yi zang-zang, in upper gTsang, he was reborn asThang-lha ’bar-ba (Blazing Plains God), the son of the one called ’Bro-rje btsan-po. How did he himself become the protector of sTag-lung?When the lord sTag-lung thang-pa the Precious One, came to sTag-lung, he established a modest chapel and remained in retreat. At thattime, he bound the local gzhi-bdag(master of the land) Char-rje to aBuddhist oath, and commanded him: “You must become the protec-tor of my doctrine.” Char-rje replied, “To be the protector of yourdoctrine there must be a profound connection between karma andwishful prayer. The son of ’Bro-rje btsan-po has been born. Now Iwill plunder his life-force and offer it to you.” Upon saying this hedisappeared.(iv) The son of ’Bro [rje btsan-po] Thang-lha ’bar-ba was himselfalways hunting wild ungulates. Moreover, he killed excessively because15sTag-lung thang-pa bkra-shis-dpal was born in 1142 to Klu-dge shan-slon andShing-bza’ dge-gsum phro-mo in mDo-stod ku-g.yung-sgang. He founded sTag-lungmonastery in 1180 and presided over its rapid expansion. He died in 1208.

Even though Char-rje always preyed on [ Thang-lha’bar-ba], he had an extremely powerful srung ’khor(talisman) on hisbody and therefore, he could not harm him. One day through thepower of karma [ Thang-lha ’bar-ba] took offhis talisman and hungit on the guy-line of his tent while he washed his hair. Suddenly, agust of wind came and the talisman was carried offby the wind.Thang-lha ’bar-ba had run after it for only a short distance before thegust of wind subsided. [He saw] the talisman hanging on the antlersof a deer, who with a broken leg was fleeing from him. Although heran very quickly he could not overtake it, and he returned back tohis residence.(v) He then mounted his horse with his gun16slung over his back andwent in pursuit [of the deer]. As usual, he was followed by dogs, birdsand other animals. Despite following it on horseback for a long time,he could not overtake the deer. If he gave up the chase the deer laiddown. When he ran in pursuit, it fled and he could not reach it. Inthis manner many days passed. Finally, in the location of sTag-lungmonastery, on the lower reaches of the sunny side of the black moun-tain called Seng-lcam brag (Lioness Rock), he arrived to find the deerlying down. When he approached the base of the formation the deerwas not there; instead there was a black man wearing armor and bran-dishing weapons. In his hand he kept the talisman. [ Thang-lha ’bar-ba] was momentarily dumbstruck and stood motionless. The black manlaughed loudly, “ha ha” and said these words, “I am the gzhi-bdag(owner of the place) of this country. There is a lama at that monasteryover there that needs a supremely eminent protector of the doctrine.I am not able to be this but you by the efficacy of fervent prayer areable to. Now, I am about to cut your life-force. Before I kill you prayfor whatever you wish. Also, I forecast that in your next life, I willbecome your minister.”(vi) Thang-lha ’bar-ba made three prayers: “Firstly, after you kill me,may I generally uphold the doctrine of the Buddha. Specifically, mayI become the protector of the bKa’ brgyud doctrine, and especiallythesrid-pa’i lha chen-po(great god of existence), incomparable to oth-ers, who protects the doctrine of oral transmissions. May I becomethe manifestation of a great protector deity. Secondly, may you neverrise above the station of my horse-keeper. May you never attain a sta-tus higher than this. Thirdly, may no one be able to remove my corpseuntil my father arrives.” Thus he spoke. Subsequently, he became theone known as dGe-bsnyen.16Me-mda’.

Having lost his son, the father ’Bro-rje btsan-po searchedfor him, asking people, one by one, where he had gone. Many infor-mants described a horseman who went in pursuit of a deer with abroken leg. By listening to the words of those he met, he finally arrivedat sTag-lung. He inquired with local people who said, “We do notknow if it is your son or not, but at that formation over there is ahuman corpse. No one has been able to remove it. Despite being therefor a long time it has not decomposed. When the shadow of birdsflying overhead contact the corpse they perish.”(viii) The father ’Bro-rje went to see for himself and found that it wasthe body of his son. He came before the lord sTag-lung thang-pa andrequested’pho-ba(conveyance of the consciousness). The lama said,“Your son does not need ’pho-ba. He shall become the executor of theDoctrine. Transfer the corpse to the red slate house on the peak ofthe mountain from where it cannot see its own country.” (This moun-tain is known by the name of g.Ya’ sgang-rtse / Slate Ridge-Top). Aguide was also dispatched. When the corpse was being carried alongthe way eight droplets of blood fell from it. These in succession becamethe eight great wild btsan, and along with [the corpse] there are nine.(ix) From the first droplet of blood came g.Ya’ dmar btsan-rgod chen-po. From the second droplet came bDud-btsan gle-bo mi-zan. Thesetwo are called the ‘vanguard generals’ (ru-’dren dmag-dpon) in commandof one hundred thousand divisions of btsan.

Nepal, June 18–20, and November 29 and30, 1998.Pho-bo dbang-phyug (also called dPa’ bo dbang-phyug) is a wellknown spirit-medium from the Da-rog mtsho region of ’Brong-patsho-ba dgu (’Brong-pa county).18He was the object of a landmarkstudy carried out 30 years ago by Berglie (1976; 1978; 1980), whichI refer to here in a number of contexts. For many years the lha-pahas resided at the Hyangja refugee camp located on the outskirts ofthe Nepalese city of Pokhara. Pho-bo dbang-phyug lives in a smallhouse where he still carries out his work as a spirit-medium. Forsome years he has kept a register of the people who have soughthis help. In it they have written short notes explaining why theyhave come, and the amount money they have donated for his ser-vices. Pho-bo dbang-phyug does not directly charge for his work asalha-pabut rather depends on the generosity of those he has aided.However, his Tibetan and Nepalese clients are traditionally acquaintedwith reciprocal arrangements and well understand that leaving anoffering is imperative. Among his clientele are many from the Gurungethnic group who live in the hills around Pokhara as well as sev-eral Westerners. According to the register, they come to Pho-bodbang-phyug for a variety of physical and mental illnesses. OneWestern physician wrote that he was impressed with Pho-bo dbang-phyug, and that he had apparently cured him of chronic fatigue andinsomnia.17Berglie’s study of Pho-bo dbang-phyug (1976: 87) estimates that he was beenborn around 1930. Pho-bo(elder brother) is a title of respect for senior males pop-ularly used in Upper Tibet. This term is a synonym for the more commonly usedA-jo.18Pho-bo dbang-phyug connects archaeological sites in his homeland to the Bon-po and personalities in the Ge-sar epic. See Bellezza 1999, p. 76."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums67Pho-bo dbang-phyug refers to himself as dPa’ rabs bcu-gsum, thethirteenth generation in a family lineage of spirit-mediums.19He isnot able to list by name the members of his lineage and we shouldnot take this number too literally, but rather to mean that he prac-tices a centuries-old hereditary profession. The number thirteen isoften used symbolically in the Bon tradition to convey completegroups of deities and mountains, as well as cosmological principles.Pho-bo dbang-phyug’s maternal grandfather Pha-lha was a spirit-medium of special distinction for the mountain deity Gangs-ri Lha-btsan. He is said to have once disappeared under the waters ofMa-pham g.yu-mtsho during the course of a performance. Pho-bodbang-phyug reports that it was from his grandfather that he receivedmuch of his training and spiritual guidance. Pha-lha died when Pho-bo dbang-phyug was about 21 years of age and away in the MountrTa-rgo locale. He disclosed to me that he earned his keep there byperforming for local families, both Bon-po and Buddhist. Unfortunately,the long family lineage of spirit-mediums may come to an end withPho-bo dbang-phyug; his son has not been initiated into the profession.In a Buddhist myth of origin it was Gu-ru Rin-po-che who invitedspirit-mediums from the four cardinal directions, the Phyogs-bzhidpa’ rabs, to come and practice in Tibet so that they could alleviatethe suffering of the people. According to the etiologic myth handeddown to Pho-bo dbang-phyug from his grandfather, in very ancienttimes there were four bla-chen(great lamas), four rgyal-chen(great kings)and four dpa’ chen(great spirit-mediums) in Tibet).20The names andresidences of the original dPa’ chen bzhi are said to be as follows:1) east—gZigs-dkar (White Vision) dpa’ bo, who resided in the placeof crystal, called Brag phug shel-dkar phug;212) south—A-chen22dpa’19Berglie (1976: 88) reports that he is the ninth in a lineage of lha-pa.20This myth illustrates the importance of thelha-pa, who sat along side greatlamas and kings, and seems to reflect the early religious and political nexus thatexisted between royalty and Bon priests, the gshen-poanddpon-gsas.For example, inthe Bon cosmological text Srid pa’i mdzod phug(Varanasi, 1993, pp. 23, 24) we readthat at a convocation held by Tibet’s eighth king Gri-gum btsan-po: “The gshenstayed in the rows on the right and the ministers on carpets in the left rows. Thebtsan-po(king) stayed in the very center. The commoners obediently sat below.”21Among the most famous places named Shel-dkar phug (Crystal Cave) in UpperTibet is the cave situated on the southern flanks of gNyan-chen Thang-lha. Accordingto bsTan-grag lha-pa, Gu-ru Rin-po-che subdued the deity of the mountain at thislocation.22According to residents of Dang-ra g.yu-mtsho, A-chen, at least when prefixed"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"68part twobo, who resided in the place of banded agate, called Lha-rong smug-po;233) west—Khro-rgyal (Wrathful King) dpa’ bo, who resided inthe place of copper, called rDzong-ngar dmar-po (Red StrengthCastle); and 4) north—Nag-mthing (Dark Blue) dpa’ bo, who residedin the place of iron, called rDzong-sngags nag-po (Black IncantationsCastle).Pho-bo dbang-phyug states that he was around ten years old whenthe gods first appeared before him.24However, he did not becomean initiated lha-pauntil thirteen years of age during a visit to MountGangs rin-po-che. At that time he received dbang lung khrid gsum(empowerments, transmissions and instructions) from the reincarnatelama rMa-sprul rin-po-che. He asserts that first he learned that devo-tion to Buddhism and the lamas were essential to his practice, aswell as the importance of bodily cleanliness. To this day, Pho-bodbang-phyug refrains from eating garlic and chilies, and he does notdrink alcoholic beverages. He adds that he does not eat meat whenhe is to perform. His pure life style has obviously helped him becausehe has remained in excellent mental and physical condition throughthe years, although he now complains of heart troubles.Pho-bo dbang-phyug’s initiation with rMa-sprul rin-po-che is saidto have lasted nine or ten days, and was a difficult, even dangerousprocess. To protect him from harm and to test his ability, a pieceof red cloth was tied around the right ring finger and a white clotharound his left ring finger (sometimes the order of the cloths werereversed). These ties functioned to block the rtsa(subtle channels)leading from the ring fingers, and to prevent uninvited deities fromentering his body. With his fingers thus bound, the lama would askPho-bo dbang-phyug what he saw in the me-long. His first vision wasofsa-bdag(sovereign of the earth spirits), in the form of white menon white horses, who were part of gNyan-chen thang-lha’s circle ofdeities. The significance of these visions was interpreted by rMa-sprul rin-po-che. The lama also taught him which pacific or wrath-ful forms of the mountain gods should be applied for curing specificto the name of a local sacred formation called sGo-po (mGon-po) rnam-gsum, comesfrom the Zhang-zhung language (Bellezza 2001: 123).23Purple Divine Valley. This is the name of a sacred mountain found at bKra-ri gnam-mtsho (Bellezza 2001: 229), but it is not at all certain if the residence ofA-chen dpa’ bo denotes the same place.24Also see account in Berglie 1976, pp. 88, 89; 1978, pp. 41, 42."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums69disorders. At one interval in the initiation rMa-sprul rin-po-che wouldwelcome various deities into Pho-bo dbang-phyug’s me-longand askhim to identify them. This was a difficult period that lasted for fiveor six days, and his body would shake uncontrollably. The next stageof the initiation was when rMa-sprul rin-po-che removed the stringsfrom his hands, causing a violent visceral reaction. It took severaldays for this reaction to subside, and for his subtle channels to befully opened.Now that Pho-bo dbang-phyug had become a fit vehicle for thedeities, rMa-sprul rin-po-che focused on the method of practice. Helearned that during the invocation he had to fully concentrate onthe deities, and at least three libations (water, tea and milk) andincense had to be offered. Pho-bo dbang-phyug notes that somespirit-mediums offer meat, but he was taught not to. These offeringsare designed to welcome the gods to the place of practice. As heconcentrates on the deities powerful looking men appear in his fieldof vision. These are the demonic the’u-rang, ’dre andgnod-pa.25Pho-bo dbang-phyug learned that he must ignore these apparitions. Thisvision of powerful men is followed by one of weak-looking men.However, the powerful men transmogrify into weak men, and theweak men turn into powerful, resplendent figures of much beauty.These latter figures are thought to be the gods. Very soon there-after the gods appear in the me-long, the last phase of the ritual beforePho-bo dbang-phyug’s consciousness is displaced and the gods actu-ally possess him. At this instant, he claims to loose his normal senseof recollection and perception.Pho-bo dbang-phyug learned that pilgrimage is essential for aspirit-medium. He visited rTa-rgo and Gangs rin-po-che on severaloccasions, and gNyan-chen thang-lha once. According to him, themost important holy mountain is Gangs rin-po-che, followed bygNyan-chen thang-lha and then rTa-rgo. He declares that theseplaces are especially efficacious for practice, as they are the abodesof the mountain gods who form the basis of spirit-mediumship. Whileat Gangs rin-po-che, he practiced at a house-sized rock formationcalled Gangs-ri lha-btsan pho-brang, situated on the west side of theholy mountain. Male pilgrims can only enter this place in a most25Probably refers to the gnod-sbyinclass of demons and deities.

Pho-bo dbang-phyug states thatwomen are not permitted to approach this shrine. He adds that thelocal mountain guardian Gangs-ri lha-btsan has flaming red hair.Pho-bo dbang-phyug also practiced at cemeteries to learn how tocontrol the ghosts and demons that appeared before him. At rTa-rgo, he practiced at rBa-rong la located on the south end of theskor-ba(circuit) around the holy mountain range. On this pass thereis supposed to be a cliffthat sounds like a drum and the beating ofcymbals.At rTa-rgo there are two places specially singled out by the Pho-bo dbang-phyug for initiation and practice, Shod-tram phug andrDzu ’phrul phug, located on the eastern flanks of the mountainNgo-dmar lha-btsan.26Shod-tram phug is also popularly called Shokhram phug, after the sho(dice) of rTa-rgo and rang-byon(self-formed)writing resembling khram-shing(boards with magical markings) (Bellezza1997: 403). According to Pho-bo dbang-phyug, Sho khram phug wasused by the Vajrayana adept Gu-ru Rin-po-che (cf. Berglie 1976:92; 1980: 39, 40) Pho-bo dbang-phyug tells the following story con-cerning the name of the cave: in ancient times, dice players used tocome to Sho khram phug in order to capture the the’u-rangdemonthat lived there. They would grab its hairy arm and threaten to killhim unless he cooperated with the players. The dice players demandedthat he help them win the game by guiding the hand that had caughtthethe’u-rangwhen throwing the dice.Pho-bo dbang-phyug explains that inside Sho khram phug therewas a self-formed stone bsang-khang(incense burner), table and bench,which were used by the spirit-mediums while testing their abilities26Shod-tram phug is a cave associated with the great Bonrdzogs-chen-padMushod-tram chen who lived prior to the 11th century (Bellezza 1997: 403). His tenurein the nearby valley of Nyi-ma lung is documented in the Zhang zhung snyan rgyudbla ma’i rnam tharby sPa-ston bstan-rgyal bzang-po (14th century) (Delhi edition,nos. 34, 35). I explored this cave on the Upper Tibet Antiquities Expedition, dur-ing the course of an archaeological survey, in June 2001. Shod-tram phug (eleva-tion 5350m) is a small cave created from a cavity underneath a large flat boulder.Stonewalls and a stone façade prop up the roof, and outer walls have been builtaround the boulder. The random-rubble, dry-mortar walls covered in orange lichenappear to have stood for a long time as attested by local residents. Affixed to thesmoke-blackened roof of the cave are the usual offerings left by pilgrims: dabs ofbutter, tufts of white wool, paper rlung-rta(prayer flags) and old srung-mdud(protec-tion cords blessed by lamas). Inside the cave there is a single small stone platform."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums71(cf.ibid.: 92). An inferior spirit-medium would be asphyxiated by apowerful wind that entered his mouth. His remains would be foundoutside the cave and his ritual equipment inside tied to a string (ibid.:92). A mediocre spirit-medium would emerge dazed from the cave,having been beaten because of his inability to clearly distinguishbetween the gods and demons. While in the cave, the superior spirit-medium saw three kinds of self-formed writing treasures orchestratedby Gu-ru Rin-po-che: 1) dpa’-bo gter yig—relates the complete historyof the spirit-mediums; 2) mkha’ ’gro gter-yig—tells the complete his-tory of the mkha’ ’gro-ma, sky-treading female deities who help thelha-pa);27and 3) dmyal-khams bcu-brgyad gter-yig—tells the complete his-tory of the eighteen hell realms. By his own admission, Pho-bo dbang-phyug belongs to the superior grade of lha-pa. For this caliber ofspirit-medium, Sho khram phug is a romping ground where theyrevel in their abilities.Pho-bo dbang-phyug notes that the other cave in the rTa-rgoregion visited by spirit-mediums on pilgrimage is rDzul ’phrul phug(Cave of Miracles). Like Shod-tram phug, it is found on the flanksof Ngo-dmar lha-btsan.28Theme-long, the copper alloy mirror used to host the deities ofthe trance, is called theglingby Pho-bo dbang-phyug and other lha-pabecause it functions as a model or symbol of all existence. Essentially,it represents a microcosm of the universe. When one me-longisemployed in the lha-bzhugs(séance) it is divided into three concen-tric bands (gling-gsum). These three zones are the discrete territories27Themkha’ ’grorepresent various types of female divinities, however, the vari-ety associated with the lha-paof Upper Tibet are pacific deities who serve as bene-factresses of the trance ceremony.28I also explored this site on the Upper Tibet Antiquities Expedition, in June2001. rDzu ’phrul phug is not a natural cave but a manmade chamber built under-neath a large boulder, which is part of the ruins of an extensive Bon temple com-plex constructed prior to the nearby Bon monastery of Se-zhig. It is probably sonamed because in a popular folktale its roof is believed to have been magicallyconstructed by the circa 14th century adept Nam-mkha’ blo-ldan. According to thesenior-most Bon scholar Lopon Tenzin Namdak, who spent two and a half yearsin the region, most ruins in the vicinity of rDzu ’phrul phug were probably foundedin the Tibetan Imperial period (617–841) by an individual named ’Dzi-bon dbang-grub. The chamber (elevation 5100 m) constituted a rear shrine room in the maintemple compound of rDzu ’phrul phug. Five steps lead down to the four-meterlong subterranean chamber. On the ceiling are attached the same kind of offeringsfound at Shod-tram phug. On the west wall of the cave is an altar constructed ofstone and mud featuring a large central recess."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"72part twoof the three types of deities presiding over thesrid-pa-gsum, the ver-tically oriented three planes of existence. Pho-bo dbang-phyug callsthe outer ring of the me-long, tshe-ring padma ’dab-brgyad(long life eight-petal lotus). It is also known as the phyi-gling(outer world), and rep-resents the lha-yul(realm of the gods), particularly those who rulethe séance. The middle band, called the nang-gling(inner world), rep-resents the klu-yul(realm of the subterranean water spirits). Accordingto Pho-bo dbang-phyug, it is where the klu pho-nya(water serpentattendants) converge. The center of the me-longrepresents the bar-gling(middle world) and is where the possessing btsanand their manypho-nya(attendants) converge. Pho-bo dbang-phyug usually uses threeantiqueme-long, each symbolizing one realm of the srid-pa-gsum. Thebar-glingis the smallest of the three. He reports that at least one oftheme-longhe owns was donated to him by a Buddhist lama.Pho-bo dbang-phyug believes that during the performance, at themoment of possession, his rnam-shes(consciousness) is transferred tothephyi-gling. While it remains in the mirror it is protected by Gu-ru rin-po-che.29At that very moment of transference, the ’od-zer(radi-ant light embodying the consciousness) of the possessing deity isenvisioned as striking the me-long. As Pho-bo dbang-phyug lives incentral Nepal the ’od-zerof the deity must instantaneously travel hun-dreds of kilometers from its mountain abode in Tibet. Then, in veryrapid succession, thernam-shesof the deity is reflected from the me-longinto Pho-bo dbang-phyug. He describes the rnam-shesof the deitiesas having the appearance of light rays. Pho-bo dbang-phyug thinksthat hisrnam-shesdeparts and re-enters his body at the end of thetrance via the dbu-ma(central subtle channel), the opening of whichis in the fontanel. The possessing deities are said to enter and exitvia the rtsaknown as rkyang-maandro-ma(collateral subtle channels),which begin in the ring fingertips.30According to Pho-bo dbang-phyug, during spirit-possession the deities reside in the central andtwo collateral channels. Deities called rtsa-bdagwatch over the open-ings and maintain the integrity of these channels.29Gu-ru rin-po-che/Slob-dpon padma ’byung-gnas/Padmasambhava was theEighth century Vajrayana miracle worker popularly worshipped by Tibetan Buddhists.His exploits subduing demons and propagating the Thunderbolt school of Buddhismin Tibet are recorded in the Padma’i bka’ thang, among other works.

He says that it is the possessing deity who makes himdrink this ablutionary water, which originates from snow mountains,slate mountains and clay mountains. Pho-bo dbang-phyug describesthe cleansing of the outside and inside of his subtle channels withthe phrase “rtsa phyi dkar nang dkar grib kyi bsil.” There is also a groupof deities, ‘cleaners of thertsaroad’, involved in this purificationprocess (Berglie 1976: 100).Pho-bo dbang-phyug relates that when he lived in Tibet he wouldgo into trance to prevent hail and lightning strikes, which could killor injure livestock and cause great economic loss. He believes thatdragons cause these natural phenomena, but that gNyan-chen thang-lha has the power to challenge and control them. Predicting, thefuture, especially as pertains to the success of a business venture orlong trip made by a benefactor, is said to be traditionally anothercause for engaging in a séance.31Pho-bo dbang-phyug makes clear that the main purpose of invok-ing the gods and permitting them to take temporary residence inone’s body is to cure physical and mental disease. He calls the arrivalof the gods ‘descent of the deities’ (lha ’bab-pa). For Pho-bo dbang-phyug the mountain spirit whom he calls gNyan-chen thang-lha dkar-po (Great gNyan White God of the Plain) is the supreme deity ofthe trance ceremony. In prayers at the start of séance the rTa-rgodeities are invoked first, generally so that they can arrange the arrivalof gNyan-chen thang-lha. So dominant is gNyan-chen thang-lha thatPho-bo dbang-phyug considers the great mountain gods Nam-ra(chiefyul-lhaof Bar-tha) and sPom-ra (chief yul-lhaof A-mdo)32sub-servient to him. He also observes that there is an inauspicious groupof rTa-rgo spirits called rTa-rgo bshan-pa spun bdun (Seven rTa-rgo Butcher Brothers) that can create disturbances for people andspirit-mediums (cf. Berglie 1980: 41). The mountain god Nam-ra alsohas a special relationship with Pho-bo dbang-phyug because it is hisphugs-lha(family’s protective spirit), and helps to serve and defendhim during the trance ceremony.31For further information on prognostication see Berglie 1976, pp. 98, 99.32For Bon pilgrimage lore about this important holy mountain see Buffetrille1994, also Part Three, section i, p. 191 (fn. 69), Part Five, section viii, pp. 469–471."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"74part twoPho-bo dbang-phyug avers that he carries out his mediumisticactivities with the help and blessings of Gu-ru rin-po-che, Sangs-rgyas bcom-ldan (Buddha), ’Od-dpag-med (Buddha of BoundlessLight) and sPyan-ras-gzigs (bodhisattvaof Compassion). They serve asdivine patrons and protectors of the ceremony. However, the actualpossession is overseen and regulated by the chief lha-ri(mountaingods) gNyan-chen thang-lha and rTa-rgo dge-rgan. Pho-bo dbang-phyug says that in the entourage of these gods are a large numberof subsidiary deities, including the ones that possess spirit-mediums.He equates these officiating mountain deities with doctors and theirpossessing manifestations with advisors; all can help people throughspirit-mediumship. Nevertheless, he cautions that if provoked orangered they can cut short a transgressor’s life-span.Pho-bo dbang-phyug maintains that during the trance ceremonythe possessing deities can search for the lost bla(soul) of a client andretrieve it.33A person suffering from a wandering soul is listless andunresponsive, and in extreme cases catatonic. Pho-bo dbang-phyug,asseverates that loss of the soul is extremely serious for it can leadto the death of the client in a relatively short period of time. Accordingto him however, a more common cause of illness is grib(contami-nation).34While under the influence of the possessing deity, Pho-bodbang-phyug will often examine the pulse of the client and deter-mines if a gribis the afflicting agent. Various gribare thought toassume different guises and can appear as dark-colored worms or asa mass of scum. The possessing deity then calls on an ancillary figureor spirit helper—frequently in the shape of an animal—who is aremedial deity expert in removing the particular contamination thathas caused the disease.35Pho-bo dbang-phyug comments that the33Berglie (1976: 99; 1978: 46) supplies an account of Pho-bo dbang-phyug andother spirit-mediums at Hyangja retrieving an errant soul. There are various ritu-als in Bon and Buddhism for retrieval of the soul (bla-bslu) through ransom offerings(bla-glud) that do not depend on spirit-mediumship. An analysis of this common rit-ual theme is found in Karmay 1998, pp. 310–339. The text Srid rgyudrelates aprecedent for the bla-bsluritual involving the healing of the first Tibetan king gNya’khri btsan-po by Bon priests who repurchased his soul (Karmay 1998: 324–326).34Also defined as impurity, defilement or pollutant.

In one séance he accomplished this by using his drum(Berglie 1976: 97, 98).36Pho-bo dbang-phyug states that during the descent of the deitiesit is primarily different zoomorphic emanations of the mountain godgNyan-chen thang-lha (under the direction of his son Thang-srasmchor-po, the possessing deity), which cure a range of diseases causedby various grib. These deities belong to gNyan-chen thang-lha’s lha’khor(circle of deities) that conventionally numbers 360. One of hisremedial deities is Thang-lha’i khyi-rgod rag-pa (Thang-lha’s Russet-Colored Wild Dog) said to be especially efficacious in cases of maddog bite. When Pho-bo dbang-phyug is possessed by this spirit hebehaves in the fashion of a fierce dog. In Berglie’s study (1976: 97,98, 101), a vivid description of Pho-bo dbang-phyug while being pos-sessed by this deity is given. According to Pho-bo dbang-phyug,Khyi-rgod rag-pa is actually in the form of a wolf leashed to an ironchain eighteen ’dom(spans) in length by his keeper, a deity namedKhyi-rdzi brag-btsan mchor-po (Handsome Rock bTsan Dog Keeper).When his services are not needed this spirit canine is kept tied to astone found near Mount gNyan-chen thang-lha, which is as tall asan eight year-old child. Khyi-rgod rag-pa has a collar of white conch,a halter of gzi37andflames issue from the middle of his back. Otherremedial zoomorphic deities under the control of gNyan-chen thang-lha are Dred-nag sog-dkar (Black Bear with White Front Quarters)and ’Jibs-rogs ’ug-pa mchu-ring (Sucking Helper Long Beak Owl).38It is important to note that these are common ancillary spirits amongthe spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet and can appear in the retinues ofdifferent mountain deities. According to Pho-bo dbang-phyug, anotherset of remedial deities in the retinue of gNyan-chen thang-lha is theand Wolf ).

It was decided that he would go into tranceto predict the outcome of my upcoming 1999 Changthang CircuitExpedition (see Bellezza 2001). At 5:30 AM, with the very first lightof the new day, Pho-bo dbang-phyug’s son came to fetch me fromthe Hyangja guest-house. I arrived at his house to see that the spe-cial altar for the séance had already been set up on a small tablenext to his bed. This same table, when not being used for such apurpose, is where Pho-bo dbang-phyug carries out many of his house-hold chores. His permanent altar is adjacent to this small table andis where he conducts his Buddhist practice; he had already finishedhis daily prayers by the time I had arrived. Much care is taken inpreparing the altar as this is where the possessing deities and theirspirit-helpers alight. First, rice kernels in the form of a g.yung-drung(swastika) are poured on top of the table (the g.yung-drungis an aus-picious symbol decorating altars in this fashion since ancient times).For added measure, more grains of rice were scattered on top oftheg.yung-drung. Pho-bo dbang-phyug explains that this rice consti-tutes one of the offerings to the deities. During the trance ceremony,as in invocatory texts, much stress is placed on the generosity of theofficiant as a prerequisite to receiving the deity’s assistance.

He put on a brocade apron andabove it a brocade mantle. Some brocades were presented to himby His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who has watched him perform.He also suspended a brass lo ’khor bcu-gnyis(calendar wheel) aroundhis neck, worn as a kind of amulet.

His second two most important possessingdeities are rTa-rgo ngo-dmar lha-btsan (also his family protectivespirit) and rDo-rje rkyang-khra (whom he calls rKyang-sa). He alsoserves as a medium for Thang-sras mchor-po/Thang-lha’i mchor-poand Gangs-ri lha-btsan. Another possessing deity of last resort iscalled Ma-mig dgon-btsan, a protector of Ma-mig monastery, in theSeng ’khor region.64Lha-pa bstan-pa claims that although Ma-migdgon-btsan is very powerful and effective, it is difficult to embodyand hard on the health of the spirit-medium. It possesses him onlyin times of dire emergency. Lha-pa bstan-pa maintains that beforethe séance begins he has no idea which of the possessing deities willvisit him, but more times than not it is his primary deity Nam-ra.The possessing deities come to Lha-pa bstan-pa after he invokesthem in the prescribed manner. He notes that many types of dis-eases and misfortune are caused by the elemental spirits, namely thekluandbtsan. He believes that the possessing deities, in conjunctionwith their retinues of remedial spirits, wrest back clients from thegrasp of these harmful spirits.Lha-pa bstan-pa says that the trance is overseen and guarded bythebtsanprotector Jag-pa me-len (Plunderer Catcher of Fire), par-ticularly the one enshrined at Chos-sku monastery on the Gangs rin-po-che pilgrim’s circuit. Along with Nam-ra, Jag-pa me-len guardsthertsa, which begin on the ring fingers of both hands, and act asgateways for the possessing deities. In other words, Jag-pa me-lenregulates the possession of Lha-pa bstan-pa by controlling access tohis body. Lha-pa bstan-pa relates that when Jag-pa me-len entershim other possessing deities cannot, and when he is possessed byanother deity Jag-pa me-len resides in the phyi-gling. Jag-pa me-lenis also said to facilitate the transfer of the spirit-medium’s body tothe custodial care of the group of helping spirits known as grib-spyang.63Originally, the mGur-lha/’Gur-lha were a group of 13 royal mountain divini-ties circumscribing the ancient sPu-rgyal state. For basic information on this promi-nent group of deities see Tucci 1949, p. 730; Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956, pp. 223,224; Bellezza 1997, pp. 47, 48, 77 (fn. 58).64This probably refers to the ’Bar-ba spun-bdun (Seven Blazing Brothers), a localgroup of btsandeities in Ma-mig."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"90part twoThis is necessary, he explains, because his body, in its entirety, mustserve as an offering to the spirits harming his client and is conveyedto them under the supervision of Jag-pa me-len.65Lha-pa bstan-paalleges that during the trance, his body is often ritually chopped topieces and offered to the noxious agents, but due to the protectionof Jag-pa me-len and the other possessing deities the demons areunable to consume it and it is returned to him.66It is reported thatthis procedure is carried out to entice the offending spirit to leavethe client, thus allowing for the restoration of his or her health.67Lha-pa bstan-pa adds that another important figure in the tranceis Dung-skyong dkar-mo (White Conch Protectress), a queen of theklu-mo, who in many forms resides in various gnas-chen(sacred places)across Upper Tibet and other parts of the Plateau.

Gribis said to often resemble a worm whenit is removed from a client’s body. Most types of griblive in the soilfrom where they attack people and livestock. The lha-paadds thatone kind of grib, called sa-btsog(dirty earth), has the appearance ofa red worm. Lha-pa bstan-pa states that the sucking method of heal-ing is associated with a colorful assortment of primitive helping deities,many of which have zoomorphic forms. Generically calledgrib-spyang,these remedial spirits are selected by the possessing btsandeity, accord-ing to the needs of the client. Lha-pa bstan-pa adds that the pos-sessing deity in turn regulates the activities of the grib-spyang.71Lha-pa btsan-pa reports that a popular grib-spyangof Nam-ra isLha-g.yang grib-spyang (Divine Good Fortune Contamination Wolf ),a wolf with a black chest and a tawny body. It is used to cure avariety of diseases. A very powerful remedial deity of Nam-ra andMa-mig dgon-btsan is Bya ’ug-pa, an owl with a dark mottled pat-tern on its tan body.72Its long beak permits it to suck strongly inorder to access impurities, and it is especially efficacious in healingmental disorders.

The main remedial deity of Gangs-ri lha-btsan is Zangs gyimche-ba (Fangs of Copper), a copper-colored wolf spirit efficaciousin curing diseases wrought by the lha-btsan.According to Lha-pa bstan-pa, another class of diverse remedialspirits, said to have originated in India, who work under the pos-sessing deities is the rgya-dkar/rgya-gargroup. He opines that the rgya-dkardeities are mainly Himalayan in origin but he is not certain.Among the most notable members of this group is Lha-rgan dkar-po (White Old God), but Lha-pa bstan-pa says that there does notappear to be much specific lore attached to him. Me-ril dmar-po(Red Fire Pellet) is said to cause Lha-pa bstan-pa to consume hotembers while under his influence. Reportedly, this helping deity iseffective in the cure of ‘hot’ diseases (such as fevers, bilious condi-tions, etc.) and neurological ailments. A-tsa nag-po is said to benamed after an Indian tribe or clan. Lha-pa bstan-pa states thatwhile under his influence, he spits and blows on the client as a cura-tive act. The rgya-dkargroup also includes the Grub-chen brgya-bcu,the 80 adepts of yore.73The Grub-chen brgya-bcu are reported toeffect states of mind essential to the lha-pa’s well-being and effectiveness.They are also conjurers of sngags(spells) and ’phrul-ba(magic) usedto cure clients.

In the Bon tradition,Jag-pa me-len is reckoned to be a form of dMag-dpon, the greatbtsanprotector whose residence is Jo-ri, in Hor-pa township, Gro-shod (’Brong-pa county).

While not a popular deity, Jag-pa me-len has been incorporatedinto the Bon religion as well, and this may have occurred by the12th century. The colophon of a Bon text for Jag-pa me-len entitledMan ngag gshen gyi rlung bsgrub(Detailed Instructions for the Aeolian Performancesof the gShen) states that it was used by a Ghu-ru jo-rtse, who is pos-sibly the same figure as Gu-ru rnon-rtse (born 1136)? Its discoveryat a place called sNyug gi rdo-rje sgrom-bu (Treasure of theAdamantine Chest of Bamboo)77may indicate that it is also a Buddhistgter-ma(revealed text), which was appropriated and modified by theBon-po.In the Man ngag gshen gyi rlung bsgrubtext, the demon destroyingcapabilities of Jag-pa me-len are amply demonstrated in a short rit-ual to slay enemies. While different in character from the exorcis-ing rituals of the spirit-mediums, its objective is very much the same:to eliminate trouble-causing entities, particularly those of a demonicnature. Like Lha-pa bstan-pa’s and the other spirit-mediums’ pan-theon of possessing btsandeities, Jag-pa me-len’s primary function inthis Bon ritual is to destroy malignant influences in whatever formthey appear.

Unfortunately,he is mostly deaf and suffers from other infirmities, limiting theamount of information I could obtain from him. Still, due to hisgood nature, he tried to answer as many of my questions as hecould. He states that he received his title Phyogs-bzhi lha-pa (Four"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums101Cardinal Directions Spirit Medium) due to the relative placement ofhis homeland to his possessing deities. These four mountain divini-ties are: 1) north—Lha-g.yang (Divine Good Fortune), located innorthern sGer-rtse; 2) west—Gangs-ri lha-btsan; 3) south—Ngur-rugdong-btsan, located in the Ru ’thor region; and 4) east—A-dmarrol-pa, located east of the sGer-rtse county seat. He adds that healso had the possessing deity Nam-ra as a central figure. Moreover,Phyogs-bzhi lha-pa says that he occasionally served as a spirit-mediumfor subsidiary forms of gNyan-chen thang-lha.Phyogs-bzhi lha-pa affirms that his first possession came at theage of 25 after he had killed a large red fox; soon thereafter hebegan to suffer from bouts of insanity. He says that he was takento Ma-mig monastery (in Seng ’khor) and came under the chargeof a lama from Khams. This lama divined that he had made a ter-rible mistake killing the fox because it belonged to abtsan. Phyogs-bzhi lha-pa notes that for example, a mountain to the north of hiscamp called dKyil-rdo (Circle Rock) has as its ri-bdag(mountainmaster) a btsanin the form of a red fox. Realizing that his insanitywas brought on through the slaying of the fox, by his byin-brlabs(blessings) the lama was able to cure him. The lama then conse-crated Phyogs-bzhi lha-pa, enabling him to become a medium forthebtsan. The lama instructed him to wear the skin of the fox hehad slain, and said that it would either kill him or aid him in hiswork as a lha-pa. It so passed that the latter held true. Phyogs-bzhilha-pa avers that some time after his initiation, twelve people whowere possessed by spirits were summoned to Ma-mig monastery tobe tested by the lama from Khams. It was discovered that ten ofthese people were possessed by demons, but that Phyogs-bzhi lha-pa and another man named Karma rgya-mtsho were possessed byauthentic mountain deities.During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, all of Phyogs-bzhi lha-pa’s ritual paraphernalia was destroyed except for his gling.

They belonged to whathe calls the grib-spyang(contamination wolf ) class and included a wolf,a giant copper-colored dog, an owl,khyungandthang-dkar. A reme-dial spirit in the circle of Lha-g.yang was Dred-mong lag-dkar, abrown bear with white paws and a white chest.Phyogs-bzhi lha-pa claims that his was the work of the gods andthat he is not aware of all the intricacies of the methods they usedto render service to people through him. He estimates to have goneinto trance 50 or 60 times a year. Like other lha-paI have inter-viewed, he reports never to have demanded payment from his clients.Phyogs-bzhi lha-pa states that over the course of his career, he hashealed approximately seven people, twelve yaks and 30 or 40 sheepfromkhyi-smyon-nad(mad-dog disease). According to the lha-pa, var-ious elemental spirits and their agencies are the cause of disease.There are three main types of disease and pestilence me-lhog, sa-lhogandchu-lhog(of the fire, earth and water elements respectively).Components of these three elements are thought to be part of thetherapies used to heal the lhogdiseases. A number of impurities caus-ing diseases are said to manifest as worm-like creatures. One of theseissa-btsog(dirty earth), a worm of the klu. Phyogs-bzhi lha-pa observesthat if a btsanis causing illness or misfortune it is forcibly removedfrom the client by one of the possessing deities of the trance andhis spirit helpers. If the pho-lha(male protective deity) is creating dis-turbances for the client, the possessing deity will prescribe that hecarry out a lha-gsol(propitiation and offerings), as well as dedicatecertain animals of the herd to thepho-lhaand setting them free.88ix)Lha-klu, born circa 1948 Interviewed in gZhung-pa ma-mtshan, dGe-rgyas, August 14 and 15,2000, and October 15, 2002.88The biography of Mi-la ras-pa records a Bon healing ritual, in which afterbeing cured the patient frees a yak for the pho-lha, a sheep for the dgra-lhaand agoat for the srog-lha(Stein 1972: 238, 239)."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums103Lha-klu89is one of the younger spirit-mediums interviewed inUpper Tibet.

He has a generally excellent reputa-tion in his locality regarding his vocation as a spirit-medium. Hewas willing to address my many questions without hesitation.Lha-klu reports that his family originally came from sMad-ma, A-mdo (A-mdo county), and immigrated to western Tibet three gen-erations ago. His paternal uncle, Nor-bu btsan-po, was a spirit-mediumfor Rol-pa skya-bdun and an emanation of dPal-ldan lha-mo. Hisfather, bSod-nams dar-rgyas (died circa 1978, at the age of 77), wasa very adept sgrung-pa(bard) for Gling ge-sar. Lha-klu maintains thathe is the ninth generation90of spirit-medium spanning both his mater-nal and paternal lines. These included his paternal grandmother,dKar-skyid (clan: Mar-tsha), her father Gro-lo, and her grandfatherbSam ’phel. According to Lha-klu’s family tradition (said to haveexisted in written form until the Communist period), in very earlytimes, Rol-pa skya-bdun and the celestial yak Lha-g.yag dkar-pomanifested the first spirit-medium. Lha g.yag dkar-po was also respon-sible for destroying a primordial black yak demon.At the age of thirteen, Lha-klu reports that he found himself sud-denly possessed by Lha-mo. These visitations caused him to haveheart pains and various mental disturbances. Around this time, arkyangcame near his tent and he followed it. He says that his neigh-bors went to search for him and eventually found him in a madstate. This caused a considerable amount of consternation amonghis family and neighbors because it was not yet known what wascausing his possessions. Starting around age fifteen, Lha-klu statesthat he received limited training from his paternal uncle Nor-bubtsan-po. The two of them would perform together, and to regulatethe entry of the deities red strings were tied around his ring fingers.Lha-klu learned that the possessing deities reside in the three mainrtsa(subtle bio-energy channels) of his body. His practice was89In defense of this individual and his vocation, I use a pseudonym in this pub-lication.

Lha-klu recounts that whenhe was around 30 years old, a lama named ’Chi-med rin-po-che ofbKra-shis chos-gling monastery, in Tshwa-kha (in dGe-rgyas county),verified that his possessions were by authentic deities. He performedrab-gnas(consecration),khrus-gsol(ablutions ritual) and rtsa-lung(insur-ing integrity of the nerve channels) rituals for him, strengtheningLha-klu’s practice further.91Lha-klu declares that ’Chi-med rin-po-che exhorted him to serve all people without discrimination, and tonever refuse a request for help. Lha-klu admits that on account ofdifficult sociopolitical conditions in Tibet, his training was rudimen-tary. Consequently, there are many aspects of his vocation that heis unsure about, and the authority of his practice largely rests on hisfamily lineage.Lha-klu affirms that he belongs to the samelha-rgyud(lineage ofdeities) as his ancestral paternal clan members. Although none of hisseven children have yet taken up his work as a spirit-medium, hebelieves that after his death it is very likely that the same deities willpossess one of them. Lha-klu estimates that since thirteen years ofage, he has gone into trance around 3000 times, often performingmany days of the year. However, during the Chinese CulturalRevolution his work was curtailed and his ceremonial parapherna-lia confiscated (except for a mirror), which explains why he did notfully develop his practice until rather late in life. He states that hehas never demanded payment for his services and works for thosewho cannot afford to make an offering. It is clear that Lha-klu isresponsible for a kind of community-based, egalitarian and affordableform of health-care. Lha-klu readily divulges that not all his clientshave been helped by him, but his perceived success rate is highenough to insure a strong demand for his services.According to Lha-klu, there are three categories of spirit-mediums:1) Superior—can perform all kinds of magic, such as herding wildlife,traveling under the earth and flying in the sky. By travelling inthis way the superior spirit-medium can easily reach his patients91An analogous ceremony is described in Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956, pp. 425,426."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums105even if they are far away, thus dispensing with the need for ahorse.

This category of lha-pacan alsodo beneficial work but if he uses his power for demonic ends hewill destroy himself.What must be a subsidiary form of dPal-ldan lha-mo oversees theactivities of the trance and is said to possess Lha-klu.93Lha-mo haszoomorphic and anthropomorphic types of ’jibs-spyang(remedial deities).The zoomorphic variety include helping spirits in the form of a tiger,leopard, lion, black bear, brown bear, wolf, and snake all of whichhave nine heads. Lha-klu explains that these spirits have nine headsbecause many different types of faculties are needed to eliminate the360 types of gdon(demons) and 424 classes of diseases. Lha-klu believesthat brain diseases are caused by members of the lha-srin sde-brgyad(Buddhist classification of elemental spirits), heart diseases by thegnyan, and diseases of the limbs and ligaments by the klu. Some dis-eases are also precipitated by dirty water and earth.Lha-klu reports that another remedial spirit of Lha-mo is Bya-balag-ring, a khyungwith long talons. He adds that the anthropomor-phic helping spirits are the mKha’ ’gro sde-lnga, five female deitieswho personify the ’phrin-las(spiritual activities) scheme and the 92The belief in a celestial after-world has ancient precedents and may help toexplain the location of pre-Buddhist tombs on mountaintops. See Bellezza 2001,pp. 33, 34; 2002a, pp. 97–99.93As dPal-ldan lha-mo is regarded as a’jig-rten las ’das-pa’i srung-ma(an enlight-ened being that has passed beyond the Buddhist world of suffering), it would appearthat some member of her large retinue must actually be responsible for the lha-pa’spossession. My preliminary assessment of this deity indicates that it represents avestigial indigenous form, perhaps belonging to the tradition of Byang-thang lakegoddesses. Nevertheless, dPal-ldan lha-mo could, within Buddhist theological bounds,function as a rtsa’i bdag-mo(defender of the lha-pa’s subtle channels), one of the func-tions imputed to her by Lha-klu. Comprehensive reviews of this important Tibetanprotective deity are found in Tucci 1949, pp. 590–595; Nebesky Wojkowitz 1956,pp. 22–38."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"106part twooverhead direction.

The mkha’ ’groof the overhead direction is a helperand protector of thelha-pa. Lha-klu states that there are other reme-dial deities in the circle of Lha-mo but he is not aware of theirnames and specific activities. In addition to these he says that thereare four gnam gyi lha-mo (sky goddesses), four bar gyi lha-mo(goddessesof the intermediate zone) and four sa yi lha-mo (goddesses of theunderworld).Lha-klu affirms that another possessing deity group is the Rol-paskya-bdun brotherhood, headed by Rol-gtor-mchog. This group servesas the protector of his subtle channels, and members of his btsan’khor(circle) function as remedial spirits. Lha-klu envisions the Rol-pa skya-bdun as being wrathful tantric deities with six hands, threeeyes, six fangs, and copper-red clothing and body color. The Rol-pa skya-bdun also have nine-headed zoomorphic remedial spirits.Lha-klu observes that possession by Lha-mo is usually characterizedby relatively pacific activity, while that of Rol-pa skya-bdun is muchmore violent.Lha-klu asserts that other deities that help bring about the cureof a client and who protect him are his phugs-lha(family protectivespirits), which can be summoned, in difficult cases, by either Lha-mo or Rol-pa skya-bdun. They do not however, possess him andthus play what we might call an officiating role. His phugs-lha(com-monly found in families throughout Upper Tibet) include Ma-mo(fierce female spirit in the retinue of dPal-ldan lha-mo), mGon-po(Mahakala, a black-colored protector) and rTa-rgo ngo-dmar lha-btsan.

It consists of a garland of pieces of ears from slaughteredsheep and goats that belonged to the family’s herds, blue rlung-rta(prayer flags), and tufts of wool from yaks and sheep. It is reportedthat the front ka-ba(pole of the tent) is also dedicated to the mo-lha,and has a white scarf tied to it. The rear tent pole acts as a shrinefor the male protective spirits including the phugs-lha/pho-lhaanddgra-lha(warrior deity).95On it a musket and swords are attached, as wellas a piece of the tent pole that Lha-klu says was used by his parents.Lha-klu relates that in 1972, an extremely large and long-livedram (died aged 14) was born to his family. Extraordinarily, this ramhad four horns. It is said to have behaved unusually, preferring tobe alone, and in front of, the rest of the herd. It always reachednew pastures first. Calledbstan-lug(sheep of the btsan) by Lha-klu, itis thought to have been closely associated with Ngo-dmar lha-btsanand Rol-pa skya-bdun as their mount when they visited the family’scamp. Lha-klu explains that at the lha-gsol(propitiation ceremony forlocal divinities) held on Lo-gsar, this sheep was decorated with ochredesigns, while colored tassels were attached to his ears and dabs ofbutter stuck on his horns as an offering to the btsandeities. Its skullhas been preserved by Lha-klu as a kind of icon. He pronouncesthat the ram’s erect upper horns symbolize the mda’ dar, and itsdrooping lower horns, an arm cradling a tray of phye-mar(barleymeal and butter preparation).Lha-klu makes known that the main purpose of the trance cere-mony is to cure mental and physical ailments. Nevertheless, it canalso be used in the g.yang ’gugs(fortune-calling procedure), when afamily is suffering from a rash of bad luck. In this ritual the clientmust provide various food and beverage offerings, and the hair ofdifferent colored livestock. Lha-klu makes use of a bamboo mda’ darwith three joints and an ancient iron tip, ornamented with coral,turquoise and ribbons of five colors as the fortune-attracting deviceof the possessing deity. The main deity said to preside over the g.yang’gugsis Klu-mi-mgon. Another group of deities participating in theg.yang ’gugsis Nor-lha mched-brgyad (Brotherhood of Eight Wealth95For a general survey of the dgra-lhasee Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956, pp. 318–340."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"108part twoGods), led by Arya dzam bha-la.96Lha-klu describes this group ofnor-lhaas each having a different color and a different animal head.The yak god Lha g.yag dkar-po also plays a role in the fortune-summoning ritual.For the séance, Lha-klu uses a single antique brass me-longdis-covered by his paternal uncle many decades ago in the sands of Ma-pham g.yu-mtsho. It is thought to have fallen from the sky. Heemploys his me-longin the usual way, as an assembly point for thedeities of the trance. Instead of the gshang, Lha-klu uses a sil-snyan(largeflat-bell), which is rung in a similar manner by waving the lefthand. In his right hand, he holds a ∂a-ma-ruwhile reciting the invo-cations to the deity. The ∂a-ma-ruis also used to suck gribfrompatients. His altar is set up in the standard fashion with the requi-site offerings. Photos placed on it include dPal-ldan lha-mo, mGon-po and the Karma-pa. For the trance, he wears a mantle, apronandrigs-lngaornamented with the five rGyal-ba rigs-lnga. Above thecentral diadem of the rigs-lngathere is a lammergeier plume,97which96For information on the various forms of this deity see Nebesky-Wojkowitz1956, pp. 68–81. Sam-grub, a senior Ge-sar bard (interviewed in Lhasa in October,1997), sings the following lines: “If you want to increase your business pray to whiteDzam-bha-la. If you want to increase your wealth pray to black Dzam-bha-la. Ifyou want to be a leader you must be close to those who lead. If you want to behealthy you must eat a variety of foods. If you want to be happy it is better to bethe wife of an older man” (implies that he is better able to provide).97The early rock art of Upper Tibet seems to depict a variety of anthropo-morphousfigures wearing feathers on top of their heads. Hunters, priestly figuresand what may represent deities are portrayed in this manner. According to thequasi-historical text g.Yung drung bon gyi rgyud bum, the ancient gshenpriests were givenlammergeier feathers to wear in their turbans as a sign of their exalted position insociety (Bellezza 2000: 64). See, also, Karmay 1972, p. 44. In the commentary sec-tion of the Bon cosmological work Srid pa’i mdzod phugs, attributed to Dran-pa nam-mkha’ (Eighth century), we read about the rtsigs(superior distinction) for the bodyconferred on the gshen(Bon priests) in the time of Tibet’s eighth king, Gri-gumbtsan-po: “On the regal white turban of dar-seng(a type of silk) the quivering feath-ers of the vulture, the king of birds, were erected.” (dar seng la dkar po’i ’gying thod la/ bya rgyal rgod kyi ldem phod btsugs pa /). In a text entitled Ngan song skye sgo gcod pa’imdo(Bon bka’ ’gyur, vol. 67, nos. 1–63), a work of ritual performances for the higherdeities, rediscovered by Lhun-grub thogs-med, there are references to the featherattributes of two primordial gshenmanifestations of sTon-pa, the founder of the Bonreligion (no. 39, lns. 3, 4). These feathers appear to have been worn on the head:ye gshen rgod kyi ’phar ’dab can(primordial gshenholder of the flapping vulture wingsand/or tail [feathers]), and ye gshen rma bya’i ldem rgyang can(primordial gshenholderof the quivering peacock feathers). In the text Bon zhwa dkar gyi bshad legs pi wangdrug ’gyur(attributed to Bla-chen dran-pa and transmitted to g.Yung-drung gling-pa,8 folios) it records that in addition to the Bon zhwa-dkar(white hat of Bon) of"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums109is said to have a therapeutic function for the entire ceremony andits participants. It is thought to emanate healing rays of light. Lha-klu also observes that the plume symbolizes that after death the greatspirit-mediums will reside in the palaces of the mountain gods. Theeyes on the snyan-gshog(rainbowflaps) of Lha-klu’s headdress repre-sent the eyes of the gza’(planetary gods) who destroy harming forcesand demons, and help cure patients.The trance ceremony is said to start with a refuge prayer to Lha-klu’s root lamas, followed by other Buddhist refuge prayers. Next herecites a bsangs-gsol(prayers featuring the use of incense as a fumi-gant) on behalf of Gu-ru rin-po-che and then a gser-skyems(prayersaccompanied by libations) to the gzhi-bdag(class of local deities), yul-lhaandlha-srin sde-brgyad(eight types of minor Buddhist deities). Thisis followed by invocations to the deities of the trance and their ret-inues. There is very little that Lha-klu could tell me about the actualtrance because he has no recollection of what takes place during it.In earlier times, according to Lha-klu, lha-pasuch as his greatgreat-grandfather bSam ’phel could summon antelopes, onagers andlammergeiers and ride them at will ( just as the pre-Imperial gshenpriests are recorded as doing in Bon texts).98These animals are alsosaid to have carried the spirit-medium’s ritual equipment.

The progenitorof the dPon-skya clan is thought to have been a yogi who emigratedfrom India to Tibet in ancient times. In trance, Pho-bo lha-dbanghas declared that the full name of his clan is Khyung A-dkar dpon-skya (which seems to suggest that it is part of the Se-khyung proto-clan of Upper Tibet). He reports that members of his clan havespecial physical characteristics, such as pointed skulls and red in theirises of their eyes. Furthermore, he says that this clan is safe fromhailstorms that kill livestock and damage property. In addition tolha-pa, there is a history of sngags-pa(lay religious adepts) in Pho-bolha-dbang’s family, particularly among his maternal clan, the Gye-pa.Pho-bo lha-dbang maintains that from father to son, over manygenerations, the mountain gods have chosen members of his distin-guished family to assume the demanding work of being their mouth-pieces. Pho-bo lha-dbang can recite the names of nine generationsoflha-pathat preceded him. Beginning with his father they are: dPa’bo mgon-po dbang-rgyal (died in Nepal, circa 1974, at the age of87), dPa’ bo bsod-nams, sGrub-rdzug, dPon-skya sangs-rgyas, mGo-dkar, sGrub-pa skyabs, Padma skyabs, Rig ’dzin skyabs, and thehighly esteemed lha-paknown as Gu-ru skyabs. Among Pho-bo lha-dbang’s seven children, his son Karma bkra-shis (born circa 1972)has been selected by the gods to carry on the family’s profession.He is still undergoing initiation. There have also been dpa’ mo(femalespirit-mediums) in the dPon-skya clan. Pho-bo lha-dbang believesthat he is a less adept practitioner than his father, and that he, inturn, was less adept than his father. Pho-bo lha-dbang states thathis great-grandfather sGrub-rdzug was an even better practitioner.It is unclear what has caused this long-term decline in the lineageof spirit-mediumship, but according to Pho-bo lha-dbang, it is probablyrelated to the general deterioration in the virtue of human beings.Pho-bo lha-dbang shares that his father dPa’ bo mgon-po dbang-rgyal was partly initiated in Glang-ma phug (the cave of the ’Bri-gung-pa hierarch ’Jig-rten gsum-mgon), located near Nam-ra.

Pho-bo lha-dbang relates the Tibetan governmentcertification of his father as follows: at the time of dPa’ bo mgon-po’s examination, four lay officials and eight monks were convened.They made 100 dough balls, which were weighed so that they wouldall be exactly the same size. The names of demons, written on slipsof paper, were concealed in 99 of the dough balls, and inside theremaining dough ball the name of a lhawas hidden. After goinginto trance dPa’ bo mgon-po took the tray with all the dough ballsand quickly spilled out 98 of them. He revolved the tray with theremaining two balls until one jumped out into a bowl of water onthe nearby altar and the other one fell to the floor. The lha-pathencovered the dough ball resting on the ground with the tray. Removingthe tray, a local official named mKhas-lde’u tshe-rdo proceeded toopen this dough ball which produced the name of a demon. Oneof the monks now reached over towards the dough ball in the bowlof water but was prevented from touching it by dPa’ bo mgon-po,who struck his hand with a drum stick. The lha-paretorted that thisindividual was not a fully ordained monk. This actually being thecase, the monk paid his respects to the lha-pa. The dough ball wasfinally opened by the lama in charge of the examination committeeand was found to contain the name of the lha, proving that dPa’ bomgon-po was possessed by authentic deities.102He was feted withmany offerings as a reward for his successful completion of the test.Pho-bo lha-dbang, the youngest of four brothers, states that hewasfirst possessed (lha-bzhugs) at thirteen years of age. He observesthat his older brothers were spared from possession and the con-comitant distresses it causes. As often happens to neophytes, thesevisitations by the deities made the young Pho-bo lha-dbang ill, andhelp was sought to diagnose his condition. A rNying-ma lama fromgTsang province named sNying-ri khri-chen determined that ratherthan an ordinary illness, Pho-bo lha-dbang was being possessed bydeities and that gradually his health would improve as he becameaccustomed to their presence. The lama performed khrus(ablutions)102In an analogous, albeit less dramatic initiation of a lha-moin Ladakh, sheproves her ability by correctly guessing that her lha-pamentor was holding a sin-gle grain of rice concealed in his hand (Schenk 1993: 337)."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums113for him with the effect of absolving sin and purifying the subtle chan-nels. sNying-ri khri-chen also bestowed rTa-mgrin, Phyag-na rdo-rjeand Bya-khyung dbang(deity empowerments) to facilitate his mediu-mistic activities. Pho-bo lha-dbang recalls that all through his ado-lescence, his father dPa’ bo mgon-po would have them go into trancetogether so that he could become increasingly acquainted with thedeities, and the way in which they used his senses and body. Hedid not make his first utterance under possession, however, until hewas 23 years old. Unlike many other lha-painitiations in UpperTibet, no use was made of strings tied to the ring-fingers.Pho-bo lha-dbang declares that his father, like the lha-pawho camebefore him, stressed the importance of leading a clean and piouslife. As a prelude to his training, he had to carry out a minimumof one hundred thousand prostrations, one hundred thousand refugeprayers, one hundred thousand mandala offerings, Vajrasattva prac-tice103and pilgrimage. Among the pilgrimages he undertook was acircumambulation of gNam-mtsho. Pho-bo lha-dbang believes thatthirteen circuits of each sacred landform are required when makingpilgrimage. Practicing in graveyards was also useful in strengtheninghis grasp on the deities. As well as abstaining from tobacco and alco-hol, Pho-bo lha-dbang says that it is essential for him and his sonsto conduct regular religious observances, especially tshogs104offeringsto Gu-ru rin-po-che on the tenth and 15th of the lunar month, aswell as on special occasions.Pho-bo lha-dbang states that when he was around thirteen yearsof age, the 16th rGyal-ba karma-pa, Rig-pa’i rdo-rje, visited hishomeland, and performedkhrusandrab-gnasfor him. This latter cer-emony involved the byin-brlabs(blessings) of the lama and his tute-lary deities. When he was around eighteen years of age, gNam-ruwas also visited by the high lama Sa-skya khri ’dzin, who also deignedto carry out rab-gnasandkhruson his behalf. Pho-bo lha-dbangbelieves that these religious ceremonies helped to purify his bodyand mind, making him a fit vehicle for the deities. Once in Nepal,he remarks that he was afforded much spiritual help by His Eminence103This tantric deity is for the purification of the mind.

AlthoughPho-bo lha-dbang knew that the first deity to possess him was A-stag klu-mo, there was some uncertainty as to the identity of themountain gods up to this point in time. bCo-brgyad khri-chen rin-po-che, the head of the Tshar-pa subsect, encouraged him to continuein his occupation as a lha-paand not engage in ordinary work. Thelama explained that many people would benefit from his practice.Since that time, Pho-bo lha-dbang declares that he has conductedmany trance ceremonies, the exact number of which is uncertain.Pho-bo lha-dbang has preserved a Buddhist legend regarding theorigin of the Tibetan lha-pa: in the time before the Vajrayana mas-ter Gu-ru rin-po-che there were no lha-pain Tibet. Tibetans defiledthemselves with dmar-mchod(animal sacrifice) and therefore, were notfit receptacles for the deities. Thanks to Gu-ru rin-po-che this abhor-rent practice was halted and in its place, he introduced dkar-mchod(offerings that do not rely on the taking of life). At this time Gu-rurin-po-che made many offerings (including live animals) to Thang-lha and other major mountain deities, winning their favor. As aresult, they were now amenable to helping the Tibetans like neverbefore. When Gu-ru rin-po-che had completed binding the moun-tain deities to oaths, which would protect Buddhism and its adher-ents, he called upon King Khri-srong lde-btsan (755–797) to collectthirteen virtuous boys of thirteen good clans, each of whom was thir-teen years of age. These youth were assembled at bSam-yas andblessed by Gu-ru rin-po-che. Under the Vajrayana master’s guid-ance they were then instructed to attempt to be possessed by pow-erful imperial mountain god’s such as Thang-lha, ’O-lde gung-rgyaland Yar-lha sham-po. Four out of the thirteen boys were successfulin the task set out for them. These four became the firstlha-paofTibet, and were called Zur-bzhi lha-pa (Four Corners Spirit-Mediums),the founding lineages of the tradition. The Zur-bzhi lha-pa weregivenlha-chas(divine costume and paraphernalia of spirit-mediums)by Gu-ru rin-po-che, and deputed to assist people through the moun-tain gods and other divinities. One of the first four mediums belongedto the dPon-skya clan. Another of them became the Nyungs-dkarlha-pa (Mustard Seed Spirit-Medium), of Nag-shod in ’Bri-ru county.According to Pho-bo lha-dbang, this lineage also remained unbro-ken until at least 1959.

He states that the trance ceremony is convened under theauspices of these figures and that they serve as its spiritual beacon,investing the practice of spirit-mediumship with religious authorityand doctrinal legitimacy. All the activities of the possessing deitiesand their spirit helpers are managed and regulated by the yi-dam-lha. Pho-bo lha-dbang affirms that his main protectors, as well asthose of his patients, are his pha-mes-lha(ancestral clan deities) dPal-ldan lha-mo and Gur-mgon (Protector of the Tent).106These pro-tectors rule over the deities of the trance, and defend against demonsinterrupting the ceremony and hurting its participants. Pho-bo lha-dbang says that his gurus also have a vital protective and patroniz-ing function during the trance. These are conceived of as includingthose who have blessed him, as well as the entire assembly of rNying-ma lineage lamas and other Buddhist lineage lamas. Pho-bo lha-dbang mentions that another group of deities that plays a crucialrole in the trance ceremony are the female mkha’ ’gro. They includethe mKha’ ’gro sde-lnga of the five directions, five colors and fiveattributes, as well as Gu-ru rin-po-che’s two main consorts, Ye-shesmtsho-rgyal and Mandha-ra-ba.

He is not very familiar with theappearance of his possessing deities or the intricacies of their ret-inues. He notes that he has no recollection of their activities or utter-ances while in trance.

It is said that the various mountaindeities heal both human and livestock diseases, but there are subtledistinctions in their functions. However, Pho-bo lha-dbang does notappear to know what they are, nor does he know in advance whichmountain deity will appear in the trance ceremony.Pho-bo lha-dbang relates that due to his clan’s high standing andtheir religious way of life he, like his ancestors, is possessed by gNyan-chen thang-lha himself. This clearly distinguishes him from lesserlha-pain Upper Tibet who are possessed by subsidiary forms of thismighty mountain god. According to family tradition, during the earlydays of their lineage Thang-lha and other mountain deities acted asservants for the dPon-skya clan lha-pa. Pho-bo lha-dbang refers toThang-lha as ayul-lha(deity in charge of a locale), pho-lha(protec-tive deity of males), dgra-lha(protective and fortune-bestowing deity),andphugs-lha(household protector).

This ornamentation includes a colorful sash, and the silver,turquoise and coral ornaments extending over the head and backknown as lan-mjugandse-chung. In her right hand she cradles a vaseof the wealth (nor-bum) and long life (tshe-bum) type.

In her wrathful form, A-stag klu-mo is a black or red-colored goddess in the guise of a warrior. She wears a helmet andarmor, and wields a spear and bow. In her most common venaticform she is known as Du-ru109sman-mo ngo-nag, the destroyer ofhuntress can be summed up as follows: Ri-bzhi (Four Mountains) A-stag klu-mowas appointed minister by King bDud-klu-btsan, and served as his sgo-srung(gate-keeper). She erected a gur-khang(shelter) of wild yak horns at sTag-lung ri-bkra na-thang (Tiger Valley Variegated Mountain Grasslands Plain). At A-yer mun-patshur-rup she built the stone castle of dawn. At Gong-shel g.yer nyi-ma’i rang-mdogshe made the throne of the conch white lioness. She was given an iron saddle stud-ded with blazing jewels, an iron bridle and an iron rear saddle-strap by bDud-klu-btsan, which she mounted on the horse Rag-dkar drel-ser (Tan Yellow Mule). Thishorse had flames spurting from its mouth and [ran] like a swirling hurricane wind.A-stag klu-mo had the ’khor-gsum(bow and arrow and sword) and a rippling regi-mental banner. When she came from rDza-ri la-mgo bar-ma (Central Talus MountainPass) she first saw King Ge-sar. She threatened him with her bow and arrow, andcommenced to interrogate him.

In her search for thedemon she succeeded in killing every wild yak in gNam-ru exceptfor one be’u(calf under one year old), which she kept with her. Whenthe epic hero Gling ge-sar came to the area, he asked her why shehad slaughtered all the wild yaks. A-stag klu-mo explained what hadhappened. Moved by her story, Ge-sar demonstrated that her petcalf was indeed the giant yak demon by inducing it to assume itstrue appearance. It appeared with her father’s corpse impaled on itshorns. Enraged, A-stag klu-mo tried to kill it with a barrage of arrowsbut was unable to do so. Ge-sar than killed it with one of his mag-ical arrows.

Thezoomorphic remedial spirits eliminate disease-causing impurities fromthe patient’s body, such as the pernicious variety called sa-btsog grib(filthy earth contamination), which when left untreated kills a victimin seven days.

Nearthe base of the hat is an ancient brass medallion in the form of thenor-bu me ’bar(flaming spiritual jewels) called rigs-lnga ’babs-gdan, thepoint on which the rigs-lngaheaddress rests. Two red tassels (zhwa-lung), whose function is no longer clear, hang from each side of thehat. On the top of the btsan-zhwathere is a plume of thang-dkar(lam-mergeier) vulture feathers (rgod-thul). Pho-bo lha-dbang says that thissacred plume, now highly worn, was inherited from his father. Healso observes that at the beginning of the trance ceremony the rgod-thulfunctions to herald the path to the lha-pafor the yi-dam-lhaandhigh protective deities Gur-mgon and dPal-ldan lha-mo. He furtherbelieves that during the trance ceremony thethugs ’od-zer(called’od-113This type of dress is also called yul-lha-chasandbtsan-chas.

Pho-bo lha-dbang states that this plume is thecrown ornament of the lha-chas, reflecting the physical and symbolicheights attained by the lammergeier.114Like other lha-paof Upper Tibet, Pho-bo lha-dbang uses the rigs-lngaheaddress. It is worn over the btsan-zhwa. He states that it rep-resents the pact between the lha-paand Buddhism, and is an affirmationof his reliance on the doctrines of this religion. He explains that thefive lobes of the headdress contain images of the rGyal-ba rigs-lnga,the omniscient, omnipresent pentad of Buddhas responsible for help-ing all sentient beings of the universe. The rainbow-colored fan-likeextensions attached to the rigs-lngaare called snyan-gshog(ear wings).Pho-bo lha-dbang affirms that the colored strips on the snyan-gshogrepresent rainbows, the form of light that the ’od-zerof the deitiesassumes. Pho-bo lha-dbang maintains that at the start of the trancethe’od-zerof the various deities comes to him from all sides anddescends upon the rigs-lngaandsnyan-gshog. During the trance theseobjects act as collection points for the ’od-zer, which permeates theentire body of thelha-pa. Pho-bo lha-dbang notes that the outer mar-gin of the snyan-gshogis white in color and is where the ’od-zerofBuddhas, lineage lamas, and protectors Gur-mgon and dPal-ldan lha-mo assemble. The blue and green stripes are collection points forthe’od-zerof themkha’ ’groand A-stag klu-mo. The yellow stripesare for the ’od-zerof the gnyanand Dam-can mgar-ba nag-po, andthe red stripes are for the ’od-zerof thebtsan. The eye on each snyan-gshogis said to represent the eyes of Bya-khyung, and are also the114The top of the sgrung-zhwa, the hat worn by Ge-sar bards, is also often dec-orated with a plume of thang-dkarfeathers. It is generally thought that this plumeacts as a rlung-rta(an ethereal substance that insures good luck) attracting deviceand a collection point for the host of dgra-lha. In a description of the sgrung-zhwafound in Hor gling g.yul ’gyed (volumesmad-cha, p. 232) it states: “From the front,when the bird feathers shake, it is like a brown bear shaking its furry front quarters.From behind, when the bird feathers are smoothed down, it is like a lion shakingits turquoise mane. From straight ahead, when the bird feathers shake, it is like theexaltedgsas-mkhar(castle of deities) on the mountain pass.

Pho-bo lha-dbang claims that theeyes of Bya-khyung watch over him and prevent evil spirits andharmful forces from hurting him. As such, he believes that this deityhas the most vital role of any of the helping spirits in the tranceceremony. A set of ribbons—white, blue, red, green and yellow incolor—called the snyan-dar, hang from each side of the rigs-lnga. Theyare thought to be additional collection points for the ’od-zerof themkha’ ’gro.Pho-bo lha-dbang discloses that during the period of initiation, thedPon-skyalha-pawere not permitted to use the btsan-zhwaorrigs-lngabut instead had to wear the ras-thod, a white cotton turban. Therewere two types of ras-thod, depending on how much cloth was avail-able. The smaller one is said to have been a piece of cloth foldedinto a triangle and tied around the head so that a flap pointedupwards. The other type of ras-thodconsisted of a long strip of clothwound around the head sufficient times so that in the center it waselevated high above the crown. This manner of turban was alsoworn by the early Tibetan kings, such as Srong-btsan sgam-po, aswell as by the mountain god gNyan-chen thang-lha. Pho-bo lha-dbang traces the use of the ras-thodback to the grub-chenadepts ofIndia who also used turbans.115Its use is said to facilitate the adventof pacific deities, which are much easier for a neophytelha-patocope with.Although Pho-bo lha-dbang cut his hair some years ago, he notesthat it is customary for lha-pato wear their hair long. Two styles ofhair called sngags-skraare acceptable for thelha-pavocation. He assertsthat these are derived from Gu-ru rin-po-che, who wore his hair inthe same fashion as the lay religious practitioners known as sngags-pa. One style involves tying the hair in a single braid and bindingit with either a red or white string. The braid hangs loose over theback. Pho-bo lha-dbang adds that unlike the coiffure popular among115The Na-khilla-bu(spirit-mediums) of the southeastern fringe of the Tibetanplateau also wear a turban but it is red in color (Rock 1952: 101, 102, plate xxvii).Red silk turbans were also worn in Tibet by oracles possessed by btsandeities(Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956: 413), white turbans by the lha-paof sPi-ti, and red andwhite turbans by certain Bon practitioners. Similar turbans (’gying-thod) are used bydeities of Zhang-zhung origin, and by the ancient Bon gshenanddpon-gsas(priests),as well as the Tibetan kings of early times. I therefore, think it likely that beforethe adoption of the Buddhist rigs-lngaheaddress, the lha-paof Upper Tibet primarilyused a turban."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums123shepherds in Upper Tibet, there is no bang in this hairstyle. Theothersngags-spraconsists of wearing the hair bound in a topknot (thor-cog). Pho-bo lha-dbang mentions that until the time of his father, ardo-rjeand a glegs-bam(small object containing a sacred text) weretied into the topknot.Pho-bo lha-dbang upholds that the main implements to invokethe deities of the trance ceremony, as well as being instruments usedin healing rites, are the gshangand∂a-ma-ru. The bronze gshangisused to signal the mkha’ ’groand other deities to come and attendthe ceremony. Pho-bo lha-dbang believes that its sound is pleasingto the deities, but that it also functions to eliminate gnod-pa(harm)and to subdue bgegs(negative forces and obstructions often in theform of evil spirits). The gshangis also used to suck out disease-caus-inggribfrom the patients’ body. Pho-bo lha-dbang recounts that inthe time of his great great-grandfather, dPon-skya sangs-rgyas, it wasalso used as a surgical tool in operations on the head and body ofpatients, in order to extricate hard-to-reach grib. Pho-bo lha-dbangfurther recounts that in the time of his grandfather dPa’ bo bsod-nams, a livestock epidemic struck the g.Yag-pa region,116killing manyanimals. During this epidemic, a family called dPa’ bo bsod-namsto their residence in order to rescue their ailing herd of some 40 or50 yaks. He went into trance and with the dar ’phan(cloth streamers)of his gshanghe decapitated a yak with one fell swoop. The lha-pathen proceeded to hit all the other yaks in the herd with the yakhead. When he finished, dPa’ bo bsod-nams flung the decapitatedyak head some distance away with his sling. Through these activi-ties all the remaining yaks were cured.Pho-bo lha-dbang employs the ∂a-ma-ruat the beginning of theceremony to call the deities of the trance, and it is said to be veryeffective in summoning the helping spirits. The ∂a-ma-ruused byPho-bo lha-dbang has snakeskin drum heads and is empowered withsecret mantras written inside the body of the drum. Pho-bo lha-dbang divulges that the snakeskin covering the drum indicates a prac-titioner of high merit, and is efficacious in curing diseases attributed116Group of 60 confederated camps known as g.Yag-pa phru-ma drug-bcu, whichbelonged to the estate of the Pa»-chen lamas. g.Yag-pa thar-ma, centered near theThar-ma gtsang-po (presently Thar-ma township, Shan-rtsa county), was one divi-sion.

The ∂a-ma-ruis also employed to suck outimpurities from the body of patients. Pho-bo lha-dbang discloses thatat one time, the dPon-skya lha-paalso attached the flayed skin of adeceased eight-year-old girl on their ∂a-ma-ru. It is believed that thispowerful article helped to rid patients of evil influences. Pho-bo lha-dbang also plays the rnga-chen(large hanging drum) to summon deities.It too is empowered inside with secret mantras. Like thegshang, thedrums subdue evil beings and influences. Another deity-signalingdevice is thedung(conch); however, it is not used once the lha-paisin trance. Pho-bo lha-dbang recalls that in certain instances the pos-sessing deities resort to a long kha-btags(white scarf ) or ribbons ofvarious colors to suck out grib.The efficacy of the ’jibs(sucking) method of healing plays a rolein another tale, set in the time of sGrub-rdzug, which must haveoccurred sometime in the middle of the 19th century. Pho-bo lha-dbang relates the story as follows: sGrub-rdzug had two childrendPa’ bo bsod-nams, and a daughter who was an especially proficientlha-moordpa’ mo. Her abilities were widely acknowledged in theseven Sa-skya camps of what is now part of dPal-mgon county.However, the Tibetan government took a dim view of a youngwoman doing such work; the family’s large collection of ritual imple-ments were consequently seized and taken to Lhasa. In a bid tohave them returned, dPa’ bo bsod-nams and his sister traveled toLhasa. dPa’ bo bsod-nams was informed by government officials thathe could return to northern Tibet and practice as a spirit-medium,and some of the family’s basic ritual equipment was returned to him.His sister however, was thrown in jail. Not much later, 32 of thehorses belonging to the Dalai Lama were bitten by a rabid dog.dPa’ bo bsod-nams approached a government minister on behalf ofhis sister and explained that she could save the horses. His sisterwas released from jail and given back her ritual implements. Shewas taken to where the horses were corralled (presumably the chibs-rain Zhol village). Once in trance, she hurdled herself in one leapover the very high wall of the corral in which the sick horses werekept. She went on with the business of sucking the disease-causingimpurity from all the horses; when she was finished she jumped outof the corral in the same manner as she had entered it. Her treat-ment proved successful and the Dalai Lama’s horses were cured. Soimpressed with her services were government officials that not onlywas she given all her property back, but was granted a house in"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums125sKas-gdung117and a stipend as well. She became known in Lhasaas the sKas-gdung sku-rten. Although she married, she did not haveany children.Like other lha-paof Upper Tibet, Pho-bo lha-bang uses three cop-per alloy me-longset on his altar. The largest of these he calls thephyi-gling(outer world), which is placed on the middle level of thealtar. The phyi-glingis said to be a microcosm of the srid-pa-gsum(thethree vertically-oriented spheres of the universe) in which all sixorders of sentient beings reside. Pho-bo lha-dbang tells that whenthey appear in the mirror they are watched and protected by theBuddhas,yi-dam-lhaand the lineage lamas of all four schools ofBuddhism. The middle-sizedbar-gling(middle world) sits on an uppertier of the altar. It is said to function as the assembly point of thebka’ srung(protectors of the Buddhist teachings), which includes thedeities of the trance and their retinues of helping spirits. Pho-bo lha-dbang states that when a helping deity is called on, the possessingdeity retreats to the bar-glingto permit its movement from the mir-ror to him. Importantkluandklu-moare also thought to reside inthebar-glingand when needed for a healing function, can be orderedby the possessing deities. However, Pho-bo lha-dbang believes thatthe water spirits do not enter him but rather carry out their workfrom outside. Lesser kluandklu-moreside in the phyi-glingwith allother living beings. The bka’ srungare presided over by Gur-mgonand dPal-ldan lha-mo, aspects of which also reside in the bar-gling.The small nang-gling(inner world) is erected on the upper-most tierof the altar. It is said to serve as the collection point for a parcelof the radiant consciousness of the Buddhas, rNying-ma lineage lamasand other gurus of Pho-bo lha-dbang.Pho-bo lha-dbang wears a silver mirror embossed with the mys-tic syllablehrion his chest. Called dam-gsal me-long(pure resplendentmirror),118it is reported to be the place where the possessing deityresides during the trance. The radiant consciousness of the deity isseen as being on and behind the mirror, as well as inside thelha-pa’s body.

Pho-bo lha-dbang alleges that during the trance itcontains a parcel of the possessing deity’s’od-zer, and is used to helperadicate evil spirits and inimical influences. In the past, dPon-skyaspirit-mediums are said to have attached a me-longknown as ye-shesspyan(wisdom eye) to their foreheads as a collection point for the’od-zerof the tutelary deities. Another me-longwas worn over theabdomen, and functioned to protect the dPon-skyalha-pafrom inter-ference originating with spirits dwelling in the subterranean realm.Pho-bo lha-dbang calls thekha-†am rtse-gsum(trident) an attributeof Gu-ru rin-po-che, and sees it as another apotropaic instrumentfound in the trance ceremony. It is thought to exert a protectiveinfluence over the proceedings. In Tibet, the dPon-skya lha-paowneda sword, which was efficacious in cases where a patient was infectedwith the deadly contamination known as sa-btsog.It is said to havealso been useful when a patient lived a long distance away and wasunable to visit the spirit-medium. The dPon-skyalha-pa, by wieldingthe sword during the trance, could remove gribfrom afar.119Pho-bo lha-dbang recounts the following story connected to thesword, which is said to have occurred in the time of his grandfa-ther: dPa’ bo bsod-nams had a friend named Bram-ze who was alsoalha-pa, albeit of lesser ability. After failing to help his own motherwhen she became very ill, Bram-ze requested the assistance of dPa’bo bsod-nams. In order to cure her, dPa’ bo bsod-nams was pos-sessed by one of his deities. During the trance, Bram-ze pulled therigs-lngaoffof his head in jest. This enraged the possessing deity andhe took the sword displayed at the ceremony and ran it straightthrough the heart of Bram-ze. Bram-ze immediately collapsed andit was believed by those present that he was dead. Later, when herecovered, Bram-ze related that he was actually fully conscious butunable to move. He was not in pain but felt very cold inside. Afterimpaling his friend, dPa’ bo bsod-nams went on to cure Bram-ze’smother. Afterwards, Bram-ze’s father begged thelha-pato heal hisson as well. The deity possessing dPa’ bo bsod-nams agreed but onlyif Bram-ze’s family would make a ma-»iwall and place stones on it119Thegurtummediums of the rGya-hor ethnic group beat their patients withswords in order to cure them.

Having promised to do so, dPa’ bo bsod-nams pulled thesword out of Bram-ze’s body, and took butter from a tshogsofferingon the altar and spread it on the wounds where the sword hadentered and exited his body. On the sword was a little bit of bloodfrom Bram-ze’s heart. dPa’ bo bsod-nams than sprinkled yon-chab(sanctified water) on the wounds. Bram-ze was fully revived but hecarried the scars for the rest of his life.Most trance ceremonies are held in the patient’s residence butthey can also be conducted at Pho-bo lha-dbang’s residence (whichin Tibet was a tent). Pho-bo lha-dbang states that in order to erectthe altar, the site must be cleared of negative spirits and influences.This is done by placing a par-shing(wood block relief image) underthe center of the site. Thepar-shingis carved with the srid-pa ho, theprotective cosmic astrological cycle.120The table used for the altaris covered with a gzhi-khebs(a piece of felt or cotton cloth). A whitegzhi-khebsdecorated with the rdo-rje rgya-gram(crossed thunderbolts) inthe center and padma ’dab-brgyad(eight-petal lotus) on each of thefour corners, is used in trance ceremonies that call for pacific deities.Barleycorn is sprinkled on this gzhi-khebsin the form of a swastika,wish-fulfilling gems and flaming jewels. Pho-bo lha-dbang remarksthat another type of gzhi-khebsis multi-colored and is used in cere-monies in which wrathful deities are demanded. On this gzhi-khebsbarleycorn is randomly scattered. A third kind gzhi-khebsis for usewith both types of deities.On the large lower level of the altar an array of offerings are setout for the deities of the trance. These include three water bowlsthat contain saffron, one or more bowls of rice and barleycorn,flowers, cloth of five colors, a conch, a small vessel of tea, a metalskull-cup of tea, a small vessel of milk, a butter lamp, one or morevessels with incense, chang(beer), and sman-gtor(conical cake offeringswith medicinal ingredients).

Pho-bo lha-dbang uses the phur-dartosummon the demon or harming force afflicting the patient. Oncethe demon appears, it is struck with the head of the las-phur, whichcauses it to lose its grasp on the patient and flee. In trances spe-cially held for the wrathful deities, additional offerings include a basinof tea, a basin of beer, red bshos-bu(edible sacred sculptures), andthezangs-gling, a small copper horn used to call the deities partici-pating in the ceremony.On the small second tier of the altar is the phyi-gling, which isstood up in a bowl ofrtsam-pa(parched barley meal). The rtsam-pais sculpted in three layers, which are said to symbolize the threespheres of the universe. On the rim of the bowl four dabs of but-ter are placed, which according to Pho-bo lha-dbang, symbolize allgood offerings in quantities as great as the world mountain Ri-rablhun-po. Beside the phyi-glingthere is a small vessel of sman-rak121andphotographs of the 17th Karma-pa and the bCo-brgyad khri-chenrin-po-che. On the third tier of the altar the bar-glingis erected, andon the fourth or upper tier, the nang-gling, in the same types of con-tainer as the phyi-gling.The positions of the glingare said to reflectthe hierarchical positions of the deities they host.

They feature the80 Grub-chen and Gu-ru rin-po-che’s paradise, Zangs-mdog dpal-ri.After the altar is set up, Pho-bo lha-dbang dons his costume. Heis then ready to begin the trance.

This alone is enough to send him into trance;there is no need of lengthy invocations to the mountain deities or121A preparation of blood derived from animals that died of natural causes mixedwith medicinal ingredients."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums129A-stag lha-mo. First, it is believed that the ’od-zerof the higher deitiessuch as the yi-dam-lha, Gur-mgon, dPal-ldan lha-mo and themkha’’grotake up their respective positions in the me-longand on the lha-pa’s body. This facilitates the arrival of the possessing deity and hisretinue. Pho-bo lha-dbang alleges that at the moment of lha-bzhugs(possession), the possessing deity’s radiant consciousness envelops himin rainbow light. It is said to enter him via the top of his head—except for the very crown of the skull. This mode of entry is saidto distinguish the dPon-skyalha-pafrom lesser spirit-mediums, whichrely on the ring fingers for access. Pho-bo lha-dbang describes thatjust before the moment of possession, he is immobilized and tinglesinside. Also, ahead of his consciousness being displaced it seems asthough everything in his field of vision has become very distant. Itis reported that during the possession, the ’od-zerof the possessingdeity occupies any of the 80 rtsa(subtle energy channels) of the body,as well as points on the headdress, costume, dam-gsal me-long, and thehairs of the body.As for thernam-shes(consciousness) of Pho-bo lha-dbang, he believesthat at the instant of possession it is transferred to the protectiveauspices of Gu-ru rin-po-che. He envisions that somehow it is con-veyed to the heart of this deity for safekeeping. Once in trance, Pho-bo lha-dbang usually conducts various healing rites. He does notcarry out divination rituals but on some occasions the possessingdeity will utter pronouncements regarding the fate of the patient andthe success of future endeavors. The cause of the illness or misfor-tune besetting the patient is also revealed by the possessing deity.The deity usually speaks in the Tibetan language but it can alsocommunicate in lha-skad(language of the gods), which is said tosometimes sound like an Indian dialect. When the helping spirits areordered to take possession of thelha-pa’s body he will often act likethe animal form with which it is endowed.Pho-bo lha-dbang states that remuneration for his services variesaccording to the means and inclination of the patients and clients.He says that those of modest means make small offerings, and theindigent are treated for free, with no expectation of anything inreturn. On the other hand, the wealthy sometimes left the dPon-skyalha-paofferings of gold and silver. Typically, payment was madein cloth, grain, livestock, and other commodities.On the personal altar of Pho-bo lha-dbang and ones used by hisancestors is a vessel full of barleycorn in which the family mda’ dar"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"130part twois erected. This arrow is adorned with ribbons of five colors, threeeagle or lammergeier feathers, a small ’ur-rdo chu-mig dgu-sgril(slingmade of nine braids with ‘eye’ markings of the dgra-lha), a small me-long, and pieces of turquoise, coral and cowry shells. Fastened to theend is an ancient arrowhead of the thog-lcags(primordial metal) class.Along with thelha-tshogs phur-pa(deity assembly dagger), which isstood up in the same vessel, the mda ’daris reported to be the rten(support/residence) for the household deitiespho-lha, pha-mes-lha, etc.Pho-bo lha-dbang relates that in Tibet the family also had amdung-dar(spear with a red and white flag), which had a similar function.122While riding on horseback it was held erect by anchoring it to astirrup. The mda’ daris also used in g.yang ’gugs(fortune-attractingritual) conducted by Pho-bo lha-dbang for patients who have hadtheirphywa-g.yang(fortune potential) diminished. Such a condition issaid to often manifest itself in a string of unfortunate events such asloss of livestock and family illness. The g.yang ’gugsis usually presidedover by pacific forms of Thang-lha and A-stag lha-mo. Pho-bo lha-dbang says that in this ritual he waves his mda’ darwhile murmur-ing prayers; this functions to call back the patient’s fortune potential.Another ritual that depends on peaceful possessing deities is thelha-sgrig klu-sgrig(ordering the lhaandklu). As is commonly held, Pho-bo lha-dbang says that each individual and family has its own pro-tective deities (phugs-lha, pho-lha, mo-lha, etc.). He believes that whena couple enters into a matrimonial alliance it must be insured thatthese deities harmonize with one another lest the marriage be plaguedwith discord and unhappiness. Pho-bo lha-dbang says that after themarriage is finalized, couples would come to the dPon-skyalha-paso that their disparate family and personal protectors could be rec-onciled with one another. During the trance, the possessing deity isthought to rearrange the hierarchical order of these protectors. Tocarry out the lha-sgrig klu-sgrig, the bride and groom in all their finerycome before Pho-bo lha-dbang and his possessing deity. They standon a white felt mat (phying-dkar) decorated with painted or barleycorn motifs including g.yung-drung lag-sbrel(interconnected swastikas)122Thebtsan-mdung, a lance with a red triangular ensign fastened to it, was usedby Tibetan spirit-mediums that were possessed by btsan.

The groom also holds a mda’ darin his right hand and bowl of phye-marin his left. Pho-bo lha-dbangobserves that these objects serve as offerings and as supports for theirpersonal deities, and help to attract happiness and long life to thecouple. He then places a white kha-btagsover the shoulders of thecouple thereby effecting a reordering of the deities.Pho-bo lha-dbang states that another method of bringing pros-perity to a client and his or her household entails the consecrationof selected livestock and the dedication of these animals to the per-sonal deities and other protectors. This is carried out to insure thatthe herds are sufficiently protected from all threats, to increase milkproduction, and to enhance the survival rate of young animals. Hesays that whilst in trance, he scatters barleycorn and sprinkleskhrus-chuon the chosen animals, and intones prayers thus making themafit vehicle for the deities. Once the animals are so sanctified, theyremain the property of the deities for the rest of their lives. It isthought that the radiant consciousness of the deities resides in andaround the animals, exerting a salubrious influence over the entireherd. Only highly-prized animals with certain colors and markingsare chosen for this ritual procedure. Pho-bo lha-dbang notes thatyaks thus selected are calledzhol-po, and sheep don-po.

He cautions that soulloss is a very serious condition and can lead to the death of thepatient. He believes that victims of soul loss suffer from a steadilydeteriorating mental and physical state. The bla ’gugsused by Pho-bo lha-dbang relies on recalling the lost soul through the use of abutter sculpture (bla-gzugs) in the form of a sheep. The bla-gzugsisallowed to float in a basin containing milk and water, the bla-mtsho(soul lake). According to Pho-bo lha-dbang, all Tibetans at one timehad soul lakes; the basin and its contents now act as a substitute.Once he is possessed by his deities, the lha-pauses his mda’ dartorotate the bla-gzugsin the basin of liquid while he entreats the soulto return to the patient. The sculpture of the sheep is then allowedtofloat freely until it comes to rest. Pho-bo lha-dbang expresses thatthe direction in which the head of the sheep points is an indicationof the efficacy of the ritual; if it faces the patient this is a sign thathis or her soul has returned. If the sheep’s head points to the altarthis is a sign for the lha-pato chant more prayers, as the soul hasnot fully resettled itself in the patient. If the sheep’s head faces Pho-bo lha-dbang, the position of the soul in the body of the patient iseven more tenuous; many additional prayers are required to secureit. If the sheep’s head points in any other direction it means the rit-ual has been unsuccessful and that it must be repeated.Pho-bo lha-dbang states that until his father’s time, the bla ’gugsritual was practiced very differently. A patient suffering from soulloss would come to the trance ceremony dressed in his or her finestclothes and ornaments. He or she also had to bring a bla-gnas(soulreceptacle) in the form of a piece of g.yu drug-dkar(a high quality124The analogous ritual conducted by clerical and lay religious practitioners iscalledbla-bslu(repurchase of the bla). This is the kind of ritual now practiced byPho-bo lha-dbang.

Akhro(an iron alloy)basin decorated with the eight auspicious symbols was filled withmilk and water. It was then covered with different colored pieces ofcloth and sealed with a string. The milk and water represented thebla-mtshoof the patient; the khrovessel, the earth; and the eight aus-picious symbols, the friends of the soul. Whilst in trance the lha-pawould take thebla-gnasand thoroughly clean the stones in order thatthey might be a fit vehicle for the return of the soul. He thenarranged them on a white string with the piece of turquoise in themiddle. Taking his sling he hollowed out a piece of spag(barley mealdough) and placed the bla-gnasinside it. The lha-pawould then senda youth born in the year of the Tiger—24 years of age or younger—with the dough ball containing the bla-gnasand his sling outside thetent, specifying both the direction and distance he should go in. Thisyouth had to be of good virtue and from a good clan. He carrieda sword and wore a hat with four corners called tshe-ring skyin-khebs.After reaching the stipulated location he said a prayer to Gu-ru rin-po-che and hurled the dough ball as far as he could with the sling.Pho-bo lha-dbang maintains that the possessing deity, such as Thang-lha, under the direction of Gu-ru rin-po-che, would then retrievethe soul and bring it back to the bla-gnas. He further alleges thatsoon thereafter, when the vessel holding the bla-mtshowas opened,the patient or his or her representative would miraculously find thebla-gnasinside. If the bla-gnaswas not returned to thebla-mtsho, theentire procedure would be carried out a second and even a thirdtime if necessary.In addition to sucking out grib,the deities that possess Pho-bo lha-dbang rely on several other remedial procedures. This includes blow-ing on the patient with air that contains sngags(spells) uttered by thelha-pa. Pho-bo lha-dbang says that this blowing technique and theapplication of spells is also used by the possessing deity to empowerand bless knotted cords (srung-mdud/srung-ba) and other items. Hebelieves that these articles serve to protect clients from misfortune,prevent the spread of contagious diseases and attack by demons.

It is important that the animals be completely white or black.The prepared cords are given to clients to tie around their necks.They are also said to be fastened to the mane of horses, and thebacks of yaks, sheep and goats. Reportedly, white srung-mdudare usu-ally for long life, the benefit of the mind and other peaceful modal-ities. Black srung-mdudfunction to forestall harm and evil. A srung-mdudplaited from black and white wool obtained from slaughtered sheepand tied with nine knots is effective in arthritis. It is tied around theafflicted joint. A red cotton cord called skyur-srungis prepared foranimals that have miscarried or lost their young shortly after birth.It is tied to the tail of the animals, and is said to substantially increasethe survival rate of their offspring. Pho-bo lha-dbang relates that anespecially potent charm called ’gog-srung(prevention protection) is prepared from black and white wool plaited together, seven blackpeas and an owl feather. It is used to prevent the spread of live-stock epidemics. The peas, sewn into a white cotton pouch, and owlfeather, are attached to the cord. The ’gog-srungis empowered bythe possessing deity through the use of black juniper smoke andspells. It is then tied to the withers of the lead animal of the herd.It is important that this animal has well-formed, intact ears andhorns. Pho-bo lha-dbang believes that a single application of the ’gog-srungis sufficient to protect the entire herd. Pho-bo lha-dbang con-siders a srung-mdudmade from the hair of a brown bear effective inwarding offdiseases caused by the female ’dre(demons). It is usu-ally hung above the entrance to the tent. A srung-mdudof camel hairis also hung above the entrance. It is said to be effective protectionagainst all classes of diseases and demons. A srung-mdudspun fromwild yak hair is tied to both people and animals to prevent themfrom being struck by lightning. It is also hung above the thresholdof the tent for the same purpose.

He says that incense is also used inthelha-gsolto purify deities implicated in a patient’s illness. Pho-bolha-dbang believes that through non-virtuous activities, the personaldeities (such as the phugs-lha, yul-lha, dgra-lhaandpho-lha) and otherdivinities like the lake and mountain spirits can become sullied, thuscausing physical and mental ailments. It then becomes necessary torestore the balance between individuals and their protective deitiesusing the healing agency of aromatic substances. Incense also func-tions as a kind of remuneration to the deities, inclining them to helpthe patient. Pho-bo lha-dbang avers that these deities regulate anindividual’s power and abilities (nus-pa), therefore it is essential thatthey are in concord. During the lha-gsol, the patient or his repre-sentative makes offerings while invoking the deities with the sacredsyllablebsworepeated again and again. Pho-bo lha-dbang says hismain role is to play his musical instruments and direct the pro-ceedings. Another component of the lha-gsolis the offering of tea,milk and beer to the deities. At the behest of thelha-pa, these offeringsare tossed outside the tent by the patient or his representative. Pho-bo lha-dbang relates that in the past, wealthy patients sometimesoffered silver and gold dust to burn with the incense, or to use inthegser-skyems(libations). Thelha-gsolritual is also employed in tranceby Pho-bo lha-dbang to gain the favor of a client’s personal deitiesin matters of travel and business. He states that during the tranceceremony,lha-gsolcan constitute the main activity or be held in an abbreviated form (bsdus-pa) in conjunction with other restorativerituals.Pho-bo lha-dbang reports that lustration of patients and personaldeities can also be carried out usingkhrus-chu(lustral water). Whenthis method is used, Pho-bo lha-dbang sprinkles his patients and thesite of the ceremony with khrus-chu, consisting of water mixed withsaffron and milk. This remedial procedure is reputed to remove dis-ease and misfortune causing impurities. Ordinarily, khrus-chuis sprin-kled using peacock feathers, ardo-rje, or ku-shagrass. However, forcertain types of griba parrot feather is used instead. Pho-bo lha-dbang states that enticement rituals known as mdos(see Part Three,section iii, pp. 243–248) were also used by the dPon-skya lha-pa, asthey are by other types of religious practitioners.According to Pho-bo lha-dbang, a common method of eradicatingailments caused by evil spirits or negative influences involves the use"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"136part twoof mustard seeds, gu-gul(Commiphora mukul, an aromatic medicinalresin) and shug-nag(black juniper), which are empowered with spellsby the possessing deity. These substances are burnt in a small censerand a relative of the patient circles him or her three times with it.The contents of the censer are then thrown outside the tent by therelative, removing the cause of affliction. Pho-bo lha-dbang says thata more powerful method of exorcism resorted to by him and hisancestors entails the use of the patient’s slang-nga, a large metal ves-sel used to toast barleycorn. In this ritual, called drag-po me-zhags(wrathfulfire sling), the slang-ngaisfilled with butter and boiled onthe hearth. After reciting many mantras the lha-patakesyon-chab(sanctified water) and throws it into the boiling butter. This causesa huge flame to erupt. Pho-bo lha-dbang observes that if the flamegoes straight out through the gung-khebs(flap in the roof of a ’brog-patent) and consumes all the butter, this is a sign that the ritualhas been effective.Pho-bo lha-dbang reports that the pernicious infectious agent knownassa-btsogcan be combated by the possessing deity through a ritualknown as bye-ma sngags-ma(sand spells). This exorcistic technique usesthe black sand that barleycorn is customarily roasted in. The sandis heated in the slang-ngacauldron (commonly used for this purpose)until it is very hot to the accompaniment of many incantations. Pho-bo lha-dbang says that he then scoops up the sand in his hands andthrows it at the patient, as well as at livestock. This sand is alsomixed with water and the resulting liquid given to livestock to drink.The magically prepared black sand can also be taken away by patientsfor use at home.Another powerful exorcistic method relied upon by Pho-bo lha-dbang is called drag-po rde’u-bkram(scattering of wrathful small stones).It is used when wicked demons such as the gdon ’drecause deathsand other serious problems. The drag-po rde’u-bkraminvolves the col-lection of black and white stones from a location far removed fromthe patient’s residence. The stones are broken into pieces about thesize of a pea. During the trance ceremony, the stones are heated toan extremely high temperature using the slang-nga, accompanied bythe recitation of wrathful mantras. Pho-bo lha-dbang states that hethen grabs handfuls of the stones and throws them at the patient,his possessions, residence and livestock, in order that the demons bebanished."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums137Pho-bo lha-dbang attests that the most dangerous type of demonis thesri126implicated in the worst types of misfortune—such as asuccession of child deaths in a family or the massive loss of live-stock. To eliminate this demon a rite of exorcism called sri-bcad(sev-ering the sri) is employed by Pho-bo lha-dbang. He says that thepossessing deities are either thebtsanmountain deities or Dam-canmgar-ba nag-po. To carry out this rite, nine upstanding women fromnine good clans must participate. They each spin yarn dyed in fivecolors. Using one piece of each color of yarn they then braid strings.The women make nine such strings, and they are entwined to forma single cord called a sri-skud(srithread). Pho-bo lha-dbang statesthat before he goes into trance he takes a square-shaped piece ofblack cotton cloth more than one meter in length and folds it intoa triangle. Along the length of this folded piece of cloth he placesa white string called srog-skud(life-force thread). The sri-skudis setalong side it. Then the black cloth, called sri-khebs(sricover), is rolledup and bound with either a red and black string or white and blackstring known as thesri-btags(sritie). Pho-bo lha-dbang says that aftergoing into trance he takes one end of this exorcising device, and thepatient the other end. Accompanied by many mantras, he waves asgro-spungs(a bundle of lammergeier, eagle, hawk, and owl feathers)127over it three times, before striking it with the feather bundle. The126For a description of this class of demons and other ways they are counter-acted see Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956, pp. 300–303, 516–518.127According to Pho-bo lha-dbang, thesgro-spungsis made from the right tail (theso called kidney) feathers of eagle, feathers from the right wing of the thang-dkar,feathers from the right side of the chest of a hawk, and feathers from where theright wing and body of an owl meet. The feathers are bound together with red,yellow and green strings. The use of bird wings in powerful exorcistic rites is alsoattested in Bon literature. In the Mu cho khrom ’dur, a cycle of funerary texts pri-marily attributed to Mu-cho ldem-drug and other legendary early gshen, there is ananonymous and untitled text (New Collection of Bon bka’ brten, vol. 6, nos. 195–200),which describes the ritual use of various types of bird wings, including those of theeagle and thang-dkar. The bird wings function to destroy the gshin-rje(demons of thedead), close the door of ngan-song(the three lower orders of living beings) and jointhe soul and mind of the deceased, among other awe-inspiring uses. Regarding thecho-rabs(ritual origin) of these bird wings, the text states (no. 197, lns. 4–5): “In thebeginning, the great protector soul wing manifestation was emanated from the mindof gShen-rab. Intermediately, it was held by the nine gshenlineages. Presently, it israised up as the gsheninstrument of the funeral ritual.” (sprul pa’i bla gshog skyab chen’di / dang po gshen rab thugs la sprul / bar du rgyud kyi gshen dgu’i bzung / da lta ’durgshen phyag char bzhengs /)."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"138part twosri-bcaddevice is then examined to assess the success of the performance.If just the sri-skudhas been cut by the feather bundle it means thatthe outcome of the rite was very good and the patient is free fromthe grasp of the demon. If the sri-btagshas also been cut it meansthat the patient will face minor problems. The cutting of the sri-khebsby the feather bundle augurs that the patient will encounterpersistent problems. In the unlikely event that the srog-skudhas beensevered in the procedure, the patient and his family are in gravedanger. Fortunately, according to Pho-bo lha-dbang, the sri-bcadexor-cism is usually effective and brings much relief to patients.I had the good fortune of observing one of Pho-bo lha-dbang’strance ceremonies conducted to heal a middle-aged woman sufferingfrom many chronic complaints, some of which were believed causedby thekluandsa-bdag. The ceremony was also used to diagnose thecause of a nun’s illness. The nun could not attend but a diagnosisand the ritual observances she should initiate to effect a cure werepassed on to her. The possessing deity was the peaceful form of A-stag klu-mo. The ceremony consisted of exorcistic and fortune-bestow-ing rituals. Interpretation of what Pho-bo lha-dbang said during thetrance was made by his eldest son Karma bkra-shis. Even his fam-ily members report that some of what is uttered is incomprehensi-ble. This is due to unusual voice modulations, the low volume ofthe utterances, and also because of background sounds coming fromthe drum and gshang.

She cites her tutelary gods and the fewspiritually-minded people she came in contact with as assisting herin this process. Clearly, the great faith she has in her lamas anddivine protectors has played an important role in her mastery ofspirit-mediumship. It also appears to me that sGrol-dkar’s persever-ance, courage and fortitude were also instrumental in the resuscita-tion of spirit-mediumship in Ru-thog.sGrol-dkar states that her patrons of the trance are the Karma-pa, the lamas of her paternal lineage. The other patron of the séanceactivities is Gu-ru rin-po-che. She says that she begins her tranceceremony with prayers to the Karma-pa and the eight manifesta-tions of Gu-ru rin-po-che, the Gu-ru mtshan-brgyad. sGrol-dkar isilliterate; all invocations to the gurus and deities are therefore doneby heart. The main protector of the séance is dPal-ldan lha-mo.Another high protective god is the crow-faced sGo-srung mgon-pobya-rog. According to sGrol-dkar, other deities that serve as guardiansduring the trance are her phugs-lha(family protective deity) Dam-canmgar-ba nag-po and her mo-lha(maternal protective deity) Dung-skyong dkar-mo, a klu-mothat resides at Ri’u Am-chung. She believesthat during the ceremony, an aspect of all the divine participantsand protectors of the trance come to reside in her gling. She dividestheglinginto the typical three concentric bands representative of thethree domains of the universe: sky, earth and underworld. However,she is not familiar with the way in which the deities arrange them-selves in the mirror. At the moment of possession, sGrol-dkar thinksthat her rnam-shes(consciousness) is conveyed to the glingand guardedover by dPal-ldan lha-mo.sGrol-dkar maintains that the most important patronizing deityinvolved in trance ceremony is gNyan-chen thang-lha. He is said to"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"144part twoofficiate over the proceedings of the trance, regulating the activitiesof the various possessing deities. A primary pair of possessing deitiesare Thang-lha’i klu-btsan, a female-male dyad in the circle of gNyan-chen thang-lha. Another possessing pair of deities consisting of a klu-moandbtsanis simply called by sGrol-dkar Ru-thog klu-btsan, aftertheir place of residence.131She refers to this divine husband and wifeasMyes-myes(grandfather) and I-pi(grandmother) respectively, andthey are thought of as the ancestral couple of Ru-thog.132However,sGrol-dkar says she does not specifically know how they gave riseto the living beings of the region. sGrol-dkar’s most common pos-sessing deity is Ngur-ru byang-btsan of O-byang, wearer of the rigs-lnga.133Anotherbtsandeity that sGrol-dkar says possesses her isbTsan-rgod nam-ra of Bar-tha. As with other spirit-mediums, shenotes that the fiercebtsandeities participate in exorcising evil spiritsand in healing rites. Another deity that she claims takes hold of heris Ge-khod dbang-thang dkar-po, the chief yul-lhaof Ru-thog.134His131It is unclear which mountain sGrol-dkar refers to. The female aspect of Ru-thog (Klu-btsan mchor-mo) is most probably the deity popularly known as Nya-ni,the chief klu-moof Ru-thog proper. This locale is also known as rDzong-ri, mDzo-mo ru-rdzong, and mTsho-mo ru-rdzong after the ancient fortress located there.For archaeological information on this locale see Bellezza 2000, pp. 102–104.132It is a common custom in mNga’ ris (particularly in Ru-thog, sGar and rTsa-mda’) to refer to the various female yul-lhaandklu-moasI-pi(grandmother) andthe male yul-lhaasmyes-myes(grandfather).133The name of this deity is also inverted to read Byang-btsan ngur-ru. It is theyul-lhaof O-byang (also called ¤o-ma-ni, which in the language of La-dwags means‘Country of Residence that Sprung Forth from the Earth’), located on the northshore of Ru-thog’s mTsho-mo ngang-la. According to legend, it came to this placein the form of a duck from gNas-chung monastery, in Lhasa. It was one of fourNgur-ru deities that flew offin the cardinal directions. Ngur-ru byang-btsan flewnorth from gNas-chung and circled Ru-thog’s Lhun-grub chos-lding monastery threetimes before it landed near a ma-»iwheel in O-byang. It exhibited wonderful signsand then flew offto mGon-po lha-ri. A shrine called Byang-btsan ngur-ru btsan-khang came to be founded at both of these locations. See Chos-ngag, pp. 173–174.134This sacred mountain (33° 18'' north latitude / 79° 46'' east longitude) is alsocommonly called Ge-khod gnyan-lung. In the local sTod dialect the pronunciationand spelling of Ge-khod has been corrupted to rGyab-sgog or rGya ’og. However,according to local experts such as the head lama of the Ru-thog monastery, MyesBlo-bzang bstan-pa (born circa 1932), there is no question that the original spellingwas Ge-khod. This is corroborated by Bon literary sources. In the local oral tra-dition, Ge-khod was the lha-ri(divine mountain) of the ancient Hor, who once occu-pied Ru-thog. The Hor are commonly thought to have come from the region knownin Chinese as Xinjiang (Eastern Turkestan) during the time of the epic hero Glingge-sar. Their leader, bShan-pa sme-ru-rtse, lent his name to the old citadel at Ru-thog.

The lha-gsolconsists of invocations and offerings to the yul-lha. sGrol-dkar adds that Ge-khod’s mate, the klu-moKlu-btsan mchor-mo, also takes part in séances. According to her, two other key klu-moare Khyung-sprug dkar-mo (White Girl Khyung) and Klu-mo rgya-bkra mchor-mo (a multi-colored hawk). Khyung-sprug dkar-mo hasa host of khyungwith the same appearance as herself. Both of theseklu-moare said to reside in the great lakes of Upper Tibet such asmTsho ma-pham. However, in keeping with their ornithomorphousappearance, they also have a celestial identity.135sGrol-dkar reports that she mostly sucks out gribthat cause illnessin her patients by using the gshang. sGrol-dkar states that the reme-dial spirits who carry out the removal of impurities include Thang-lha’i khyi-rgod rag-pa (Thang-lha’s Tawny Wild Dog), Thang-lha’i’brong-dur rag-pa (Thang lha’s Tawny Cemetery Wild Yak), Thang-lha mi-dkar rta-dkar (resplendent white men mounted on white steedsin the circle of Thang-lha), Za-rog spyang-gu spun-dun (seven broth-ers in the form of wolves), and Bya-khyung-rgod (an eagle-like spirit).Another deity that presides over the sucking out of contamination(’jibs-rogs) is A-dmar rol-pa skya-bdun of sGer-rtse. sGrol-dkar alsouses a rdo-rjeto rid patients of harm-causing influences, and a mda’darfor the bestowal of good fortune.sGrol-dkar accepts that the Thang-lha, Ge-khod, Ru-thog, andotherklu-mocure diseases attributed to this class of deities such asskin ailments and arthritis.

SeeBellezza 1997, p. 345.136From a Buddhist doctrinal perspective however, it is likely that sGrol-dkar isactually channeling a subsidiary form or emanation of gNam-mtsho rather than theprimary goddess herself.

This is realized through a g.yang ’gugsritualcarried out on behalf of the lakes of Upper Tibet. This ritual helpsto increase the milk production of livestock. Lha-mtsho mchor-moalso frequently participates in a ritual to insure that the personalprotective spirits of a newly wed couple are in concordance with oneanother. While under the possession of the klu-mosGrol-dkar con-ducts the klu-gsolritual, which entails the offering of juniper, san-dalwood and spos-dkarincense to the klu, as well as the first portions(phud) of milk, spring water, tea, and grains.sGrol-dkar explains that the various klu-moofficiate over their ownklu-gsolandg.yang ’gugsrituals, giving them a degree of effectivenessonly possible for divine ritualists. Likewise, Ge-khod and Thang-lhaconduct their own lha-gsol. She points out however, the offerings theymake are not merely for their own satisfaction but for the entirepantheon of environment-bound deities of Upper Tibet. Perhaps mostimportantly, according to sGrol-dkar, the assemblage of offerings isalso proffered to the higher Buddhist deities, thereby bringing plea-sure not only to worldly deities but to those who have passed beyondthe sphere of mundane existence. While possessed sGrol-dkar saysthat she often instructs patients to do their own lha-gsolandklu-gsol,as well as make pilgrimage, build mchod-rtenand carve ma-»istones.sGrol-dkar claims that these activities are prescribed by the deitiesto eliminate gnod-pa(harm) and bar-chad(obstacles) that cause mis-fortune and illness.To favorably influence the weather, sGrol-dkar undertakes to bepossessed by a goddess called Ma-ne-ne or Khro-mo nag-mo, whoshe reports is the elder sister of the epic hero Gling ge-sar.137Thisdeity is said to be able to avert hailstorms and other destructiveweather by her association with the sky-dwelling mkha’ ’gro-ma. sGrol-dkar states that invocations to Gling ge-sar and Gu-ru rin-po-cheare also an instrumental part of the ritual to affect the weather.137Stein (1981: 6) reports that Ma-ne-ne is the same as Gung-sman rgyal-mo,the heavenly aunt of Ge-sar, and his advisor and protectress."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums147Other deities that play a part include the savioress sGrol-ma dkar-mo and Tibet’s main gcodfigures, Pha dam-pa sangs-rgyas and Ma-cig lab-sgron. The latter personality is reported by sGrol-dkar tohave a close correspondence with Ma-ne-ne.On June 5, 2002, I had the privilege of observing sGrol-dkar per-form a g.yang ’gugsritual while in trance. It was decided that wewould seek good fortune for my High Tibet Circle Expedition thatwas then in progress, as well as for the countryside in general. Themain possessing deity of the trance ceremony was Lha-mtsho mchor-mo. sGrol-dkar’s husband acted as her assistant, helping in the rit-ual performances. Her husband also kindly helped to interpret thevarious activities and utterances of the trance for me. The séancewas held in the evening after the milking and corralling of the ewesand goats. The basic structure of the trance ceremony was as follows:1) Altar set up and costume donned.2) Buddhist invocations made.3) Deity enters sGrol-dkar.4) Deity invokes the Karma-pa and pays her respects to him andhis lineage.5) Lha-mtsho mchor-mo formally announces her identity.6) The various klu-moand other local deities are invoked, and theklu-rgyud(lineage of the female klu) proclaimed.7)g.Yang ’gugsritual performed.

On the ceremonialaltar a modest array of offerings are placed. These include a smallbowl of juniper and gangs-spos138incense, a candle, an oil lamp, tinyvessels of black tea, milk, water and salt, and a rdo-rje.There is alsoa bowl heaped high with rtsam-pain which the gling, another rdo-rjeand a small photo of the lha-mo ’tshogs-zhing (depiction of dPal-ldanlha-mo and her retinue) are inserted.22:10: sGrol-dkar dons her green stod-khebs(mantle) and a kerchiefwhile reciting skyabs ’gro(Buddhist refuge prayers) and dedicatoryprayers for the well-being of all sentient beings.

At timesit is soft and measured, at other times high pitched and piercing.Her facial expressions also change from contemplative to somewhatcontorted. At times she is wrathful and intense, at other times dur-ing the trance deeply absorbed. It is a fine ceremonial performancerich in nuance and emotion.22:22: sGrol-dkar stops playing her instruments and chants theklu-rgyud.

The klu-rgyudalso notes that these female deitiesare led by dPal-ldan lha-mo; however, it provides no cosmogoniclore (this belonging to a nearly extinct phase of the region’s culturallegacy). The mkha’ ’groare also invoked. Occasionally, the chantingis punctuated by “sngeg, sngeg, sngeg”—the sound of the rustling ofthe wings of the duck deity Ngur-ru sman-pa dkar-po.139Subsequentto the trance, sGrol-dkar notes that this male kluis a divine physi-cianfigure in the retinues of Lha-mtsho mchor-mo and the klu-moof Ru-thog.22:28: sGrol-dkar (the presiding deity) pays her respects to a num-ber of Buddhist personalities and deities while playing the ∂a-ma-ruandgshang.22:32: The g.yang ’gugssequence of the trance ceremony begins.Invoking the local deities sGrol-dkar stops playing and picks up therdo-rjeresting on the altar and begins waving it around.

The white-lipped deer (Cervus albirostris) is still foundon the eastern fringes of the Byang-thang (Schaller 1998: 143, 144).

Hislegitimacy stems from the long line of spirit-mediums in both hisfamily and his wife’s family. Pho-bo mtsho-rgyal is a soft-spoken,diffident man, who like most of Upper Tibet’s other spirit-mediums,derives his livelihood from the family’s livestock. He spends most ofthe day taking his herds to graze, limiting the amount of time hecould spare for our interviews.141The other five clans are: Gu-rub, ’A-ba, Phyug-rtsang, bDod, and sTag-rtse.These six clans are said to be the original worshippers of Ru ’thor’s sacred moun-tain, the pho-lhabKa’ lha-btsan. The mo-lhaof these six clans is the nearby moun-tain Chu-yig and the lake Rin-chen shor ’ur mtsho. According to elders, the realname of their region is Rus ’thor (Dispersed Clans), so called because it has beenenriched by a diverse mixture of clans over history."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"152part twoPho-bo mtsho-rgyal says that his teacher was his father-in-law, alha-panamed Karma who lived until he was around 80 years of age.His paternal grandfather was also a lha-pa. Pad-ma, his maternaluncle and a monk at Ma-mig monastery in Seng ’khor, sGer-rtsecounty, acted as his patron. Pho-bo mtsho-rgyal reports that Pad-ma was responsible for his rab-gnas(consecration) and khrus(ablu-tions), making him an appropriate receptacle for the deities. Pho-bomtsho-rgyal observes that a lama patron is essential for a lha-pa. Notonly does he perform the rituals that serve to protect and aid themedium, the lama provides a doctrinal grounding for the practiceas well. His first possession was by Gangs-ri lha-btsan and camewhen he was 25 years old. Karma, his father-in-law, identified thechief deities and pantheon of helping spirits who were possessinghim, and taught the techniques used by spirit-mediums for healingand fortune-bestowal. Pho-bo mtsho-rgyal relates that during theperiod of his training strings were tied around his ring fingers toregulate the entry of the possessing deities. Pho-bo mtsho-rgyal notesthat he inherited his three gling, gshangand other ritual equipmentfrom his father-in-law.According to Pho-bo mtsho-rgyal, the patron benefactors of thetrance ceremony are Gu-ru rin-po-che and thebodhisattvaof skillfulmeans, Phyag-na rdo-rje.

According to Karmarig ’dzin, a hallmark of belonging to the premier zur-bzhilineage isthat the possessing deities reside in the five main subtle energy chan-nels:dbu-ma(central channel), rkyang-ma(right collateral channel), ro-ma(left collateral channel), snying-phrom(channel in middle of theback), and stong-nyid(channel centered in the sternum). He adds thatlesser spirit-mediums cannot be so fully possessed by the deities asthey do not have full access to the subtle channels.According to Karma rig ’dzin, in early times members of the Zur-bzhi lha-babs bzhi could do great magical feats such as ride vulturesand eagles, but gradually their power diminished due to increasinggrib(contamination). He says that the original zur-bzhi lha-paweregod-like individuals, however, by being born human they suffered acertain amount of general defilement, which has mounted over thegenerations. Still, his family lineage produced strong spirit-mediums,and Karma rig ’dzin believes that his paternal uncle performed oper-ations with his phyi-gling. Karma rig ’dzin has one son and daugh-ter, neither of whom practices as a spirit-medium.Both Karma rig ’dzin’s mother and father were spirit-mediums.His father belonged to the Rag-shi clan and was born in sMar-khams, Khams. His father was a spirit-medium for many of the samedeities as himself (as well as being a Ge-sar bard). Karma rig ’dzin’smother hailed from ’Dam-gzhung and belonged to the mGar-baclan. She was a medium for the famous btsanof gNam-ru, rKyang-khra. Karma rig ’dzin states that he was born while his parents wereon pilgrimage to Gangs rin-po-che; his mother passed away one weeklater. Karma rig ’dzin and his father remained in western Tibet.

At age thirteen, after making pil-grimage to Buddhist holy sites in Nepal including the KathmanduValley, he and his father reached Na-bkra monastery in the vicin-ity of sKyid-grong/sKyid-rong. Here they met Lama Thub-bstanngag-dbang ’jigs-med, who performed the rtsa-sgo phye-ba—the open-ing and purification of the subtle energy channels, for Karma rig’dzin. He notes that this ritual included khrus(ablutions) and rab-gnas(consecration) procedures. Another procedure of the rtsa-rgo phye-bawas the binding of the ring fingers with strings to prevent unwel-come intrusions from the deities. According to Karma rig ’dzin, anymanner of god or demon can enter the body through the openingsin the ring fingers and it is far more efficacious for the possessingdeities to enter the medium from other bodily portals. He says thatthelhaenter via the top of the head, the btsanfrom the right shoul-der, and theklu-moandmkha’ ’grofrom the left shoulder. Lama Thub-bstan taught him how to distinguish between the lhaand’dre(goodand bad spirits). He also instructed him on how to recognize thevarious deities in the me-long, and how to diagnose diseases and otherproblems using the me-long. Karma rig ’dzin declares that at the com-pletion of his four month tutelage with Lama Thub-bstan, he becamea fully initiated lha-pa.Karma rig ’dzin observes that his father was a medium for anentity called ’Bum-rdza but because this was ami-shis btsan-skyes(aperson dies abtsanis born) type spirit, Lama Thub-bstan forbadehim to embody it. Karma rig ’dzin learned about the pantheon ofdeities and their various residences largely from his father (who diedwhen he was eighteen years old). For instance his father explainedthat Gangs-ri lha-btsan was the deity of the upper regions, rTa-rgothe deity of the middle regions, Thang-lha the god of the lowerregions, and sPom-ra was the god who ruled over the lowest regions(of the Tibetan Plateau). Between age fifteen and sixteen, Karma rig’dzin was in the rTa-rgo region with his father on pilgrimage.

Inside he found theseat and altar of O-rgyan padma ’byung-gnas (Gu-ru rin-po-che),and the seat of Ngo-dmar lha-btsan. Karma rig ’dzin was unable totake these seats so he made his altar before them. He notes that bygoing into trance in Shod-tram phug a spirit-medium’s practice isimproved; many however are unable to gain access to the cave.As regards the origin of Shod-tram phug, Karma rig ’dzin recountsan old legend that apparently circulated around the region. This taleof the unprecedented defeat of the Vajrayana hero Gu-ru rin-po-cheis related to the Bon territorial control of the rTa-rgo region:147The huge stone forming the roof of Shod-tram phug rests on fourboulders. On the ceiling of the cave are the head and shoulder printsof Gu-ru rin-po-che, created when he magically raised the height ofthe cave to impress the rTa-rgo deities. When Gu-ru rin-po-che reachedthe region, he met rTa-rgo at rTa-rgo ’phrang (cliffs on south side ofDang-ra g.yu-mtsho). rTa-rgo asked who he was, to which Gu-ru rin-po-che replied that he was a vagrant. The mountain god retorted thathe was no such person but rather the master Padma ’byung-gnas, theone responsible for subduing all the lha-srin sde-brgyad(orders of ele-mental spirits). Gu-ru rin-po-che then admitted his true identity. rTa-rgo challenged him to a contest of magic to which he agreed. rTa-rgotold Gu-ru rin-po-che to remain at rTa-rgo ’phrang and that he wouldtry to catch him with his copper lasso. rTa-rgo flew up to his moun-tain-top palace and threw down his lasso but Gu-ru rin-po-che dis-appeared into rays of light. Not to be outdone, the mountain godmade a lasso of light rays and was successful in binding the Vajrayanamaster as light rays easily interact with one another. Having boundGu-ru rin-po-che, rTa-rgo pulled him up to his palace, and the greatguru conceded that rTa-rgo was an excellent magician. The mountaindeity requested that Gu-ru rin-po-che stay for three years to teach himmeditation. rTa-rgo then announced that he was going to build amtshams-khang(meditation house) for him. The mountain god asked thatwhile he was gone Gu-ru rin-po-che remain in his palace and enjoyany of its treasures. The Vajrayana master looked around but he couldonlyfind a black cat in a corner. When rTa-rgo returned from hisconstruction project he found Gu-ru rin-po-che staring at the cat andasked what he was looking at. Gu-ru rin-po-che answered that he could147Other legends and myths that establish Bon jurisdiction over rTa-rgo arefound in Bellezza 1997, pp. 293–295."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"158part twofind nothing in the palace but this black cat. rTa-rgo replied, “Althoughyour magical power is very great, you could not find any of my trea-sures. This black cat is actually a black bear, my gter-bdag(treasureguardian), and behind where you are standing are the three keys totreasures.” Suffering such a humiliation Gu-ru rin-po-che was unableto open rTa-rgo up as a Buddhist gnas(holy place). To demonstratehis power Gu-ru rin-po-che decided to go to Shod-tram phug, themeditation house that rTa-rgo built for him, and raise the ceiling.Karma rig ’dzin cautions that it is important for a spirit-mediumnot to wear the clothes of a deceased person or of someone whohas committed incest. Pilgrimage to 108 cemeteries, 108 springs, 108mountains and 108 mgon-khang(chapels for protective deities) greatlyenhances the power and practice of a lha-pa. He adds that he hascompleted all these pilgrimages save for the 108 cemeteries.According to Karma rig ’dzin, Gu-ru rin-po-che oversees the pro-ceedings of the trance ceremony, and plays a protective and bene-dictory role. He is the subject of invocations at the start of the séance.Karma rig ’dzin states that during the trance he has five main pro-tective deities: front—Ma-lus stong-nyid mkha’ ’gro (Thorough Empti-ness mKha’ ’gro); back—dGra-lha gnyan-stag dmar-po (Red TigergNyan dGra-lha); right—bTsan-rgod jag-pa me-len, left—mGon-pober-nag (Black Cloak mGon-po); and overhead—Lha-chen tshangs-pa (Brahma).Earlier, Karma rig ’dzin used the customary three me-long(phyi-gling, bar-gling, nang-gling) but these and his other ritual implements(some of which came from Lama Thub-bstan) were confiscated dur-ing the Chinese Cultural Revolution. He was also imprisoned at thattime.

However, Karma rig ’dzin does"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums159not know where these deities reside nor anything about their origins.148He believes that there are two rgya-gardeities involved in possession:A tsa-ra sngon-po (in handicapped cases) and rGya-gar ri-bkra mchor-po (in a variety of diseases). The latter has two special remedialdeities: sPyang-gdong sngon-po (Blue Wolf Face) and ’Ug-gu mchu-ring (Long Beak Owl).

He adds that if they are unable or unwill-ing to provide assistance they will refer patients to a lama,sngags-paor medical doctor. Karma rig ’dzin alleges that during séances involv-ing gNyan-chen thang-lha, this mountain god remains on the crownof his head directing the activities of his circle of deities. Accordingto him, the possessing members of gNyen-chen thang-lha’s retinueinclude:1) Thang-sras mchor-po (especially efficacious in childhood diseases).2) Thang-lha yar-bzhur, an infrequent possessor who Karma rig’dzin considers a minister (mainly functions to cure swelling con-ditions).3) Thang-lha’i g.yag-gshog gwa-pa (White-Faced Wild Yak of Thang-lha, effective in preventing the loss of cattle and to increase thenumbers of yaks).4) Thang-lha’i lha-lug gwa-pa (White-Faced Divine Sheep of Thang-lha, effective in preventing the loss of sheep and to increase thesize of the sheep flocks).These possessing forms of Thang-lha can employ Thang-lha khyi-rgod rag-pa as a remedial spirit who is said to be able to cure rabies,the dangerous disease known as sa-btsogand certain arthritic ailments.Karma rig ’dzin states that another deity that possesses him isrTa-rgo ngo-dmar lha-btsan. His remedial spirits are Khyi-rgod rag-pa, Wa-skya lag-dkar (Light Gray Fox with White Paws) and Dom-nag mchor-po (Handsome Black Bear).

The pos-sessing deity Rol-pa skya-bdun/’Bar-ba spun-bdun has Zangs-ri me-ri ’khyug-chen (Rapid Movement Fire Mountain Copper Mountain)149For a doctrinal assessment of this deity see Part Two, section i, pp. 58–63."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums161as its remedial spirit.

Another possessing deity is one of the btsanprotec-tors of bSam-yas monastery, bSam-yas bshan-pa dmar-po. Karmarig ’dzin relates that possession of this god occurs when patientssuffer from a lethal condition. He envisages bSam-yas bshan-pa dmar-po as riding a red horse with a white muzzle, white spot on theforehead and white hoofs. He wears a copper helmet and armor,and holds a copper lasso in his right hand and a red mdung-darinhis left. The bSam-yas lha ’khoralso includes Pe-har, the bshan-pa(butcher) deities, and bSam-yas ’brong-dur (bSam-yas Cemetery WildYak), a helping spirit that cures cattle diseases.Although Karma rig ’dzin points out that he is not possessed bythebtsanGo-ra and Nam-ra during séances he has seen their reme-dial spirits in hisbar-gling. They are Thog-khyi dmar-po (RedThunderbolt Dog) and Zangs-khyi dmar-po (Red Copper Dog)respectively.Karma rig ’dzin claims that for a horse disease known as rta-khyungnad, he is possessed by manifestations of rTa-mgrin, the horse-headedBuddhistyi-dam, and that at that time he conducts a gsol-kha(pro-pitiation ritual) directed towards rTa-mgrin. He thinks that there arethree manifestations of rTa-mgrin involved: Khro-bo rta-mgrin dmar-po, Se-ra’i rta-mgrin and bKa’ phrung drag-btsan. In thisgsol-kharitual ardo-rjeis used.Karma rig ’dzin uses his∂a-ma-ru, drum, gshang, and zangs-gling(copper horn) to call both the patron and possessing deities to thetrance venue. Before the Chinese Cultural Revolution, he used therigs-lngaheaddress but since then he has been unable to obtain anotherone. He reports that its gshog-khra(multi-colored wings) were orna-mented with the watchful eyes of the khyung. The right gshog-khrasymbolized the tiger’jibs-spyang(helping spirit) while the left gshog-khrasymbolized the wolf ’jibs-spyang. Now he uses just thebtsan-zhwa,the red peaked cap decorated with the eyes of the btsan. For sometrances he uses a plume ofthang-dkar(lammergeier) feathers on hisbtsan-zhwa. Karma rig ’dzin states that the thang-dkaris the bird ofthelhaand the representative of the mKha’ ’gro sde-lnga. Anothertype of headdress he has worn is called lha-thod, a kind of kerchiefthat wraps once around the head from which cowry shells hang.According to Karma rig ’dzin, lha-paonce used helmets, armor,spears, and bow and arrows in their trances.

He observes that the palace of Lha-chen tshangs-pa is locatedon gNyan-chen thang-lha while the one for gNyan-chen sku-lha isfound on a locale between Thang-lha and Thang-sras mchor-po.Other invocations are for the rgya-gargroup.Karma rig ’dzin asserts that at the moment of possession, thedeity’s’od-zer(radiant consciousness) enters him while his ’od-zerissimultaneously transferred to the bar-glingfor safe-keeping, for theduration of the trance. He professes that the’od-zerof the lhaiswhite, the ’od-zerof the btsanyellow, the ’od-zerof the mkha’ ’grogreen,and that the ’od-zerof the klu-mois blue. He further remarks that asall these deities are present at the trance a rainbow light descendsupon the venue.Karma rig ’dzin holds that harmful forces and elemental spiritsare either ’dul-ba(subdued) or zlog-pa(repelled) or in some cases,bound to an oath to protect the Buddhist doctrine. When the sa-bdagand twelve brtan-magoddesses are the source of problems theycan be appeased through offerings (bskang-ba).

For instance,themo-lha(personal deity of females) often belongs to the retinuesof the great lake goddesses, and if angered or defiled she can bringsickness and misfortune to a household. Karma rig ’dzin notes thattheklu-gsolis held while he is in trance. He affirms that the pre-sents offered during the klu-gsolare conveyed to the lake spirits bythe great goddess dPal-ldan skyong-ma (dPal-ldan lha-mo).

This milk is placed in a vessel with thephyi-glingand covered with a piece of cloth. The mda’ daris placedon top of the vessel. Invocations are then recited to the presidingdeity, which is either a member of gNam-mtsho phyug-mo’s retinue,amkha’ ’groor a deity in the circle of dMag-zor rgyal-mo.

Karma rig’dzin mainly uses his zangs-gling(copper horn) to suck out gribfromthe bodies of patients. He says that this method of healing is bestsuited for the sa-btsogdisease, rabies and gza’ grib. Although the suck-ing method is effective in other types ofgrib,Karma rig ’dzin advisesagainst it because it can drain patients of their vital energy like thatbound up with beneficial ‘insects’. These includelus ’bu(insect thatregulates growth), bsod-nams ’bu(insect that ensures good luck), dbang-thang ’bu(insect that regulates abilities).Karma rig ’dzin states that another method of cleansing gribiskhrus-chu, a concoction of various indigenous herbs and different col-oredflowers.

If the procedure to make it has been successful, the khrus-chuwill be multi-colored in sunlight, representing the different classes ofdeities.

A narrow hole one cubit in depth is dug,and nine different women spin wool yarn of nine different colors.While in trance, he ties nine knots, spaced three fingers apart in thestring braided from the nine pieces of yarn. Each knot is sealed withla-cha(shellac), symbolizing that the sriis bound and sealed and thusthey cannot cause any more trouble. The nine knots symbolize thatthe offendingsriwill be bound for nine years, nine months and ninedays. The string is tied around a black cloth covering a fox skull.153Thesri, are forced into this ritual prison by invoking the rGyal-barigs-lnga Buddhas.

The material aspects of the trance cer-emony were rudimentary, reflecting the lha-pa’s modest economicposition. The possessing deity was bDud-btsan dmar-po, who speaksindbus-skad(central Tibetan dialect). Other deities are said to speakin strange dialects thus necessitating an interpreter (usually one ofKarma rig ’dzin’s close friends).19:00: Preparations for the trance begin.

He is reportedto be the senior-most lha-paof the region. Pho-bo chu-bzang is ahighly pious and reticent man, and he normally does not meet withanyone but his close family members. Visitors are discouraged fromseeing him except when in dire need of his services. Pho-bo chu-bzang however, kindly agreed to be interviewed for this book.Pho-bo chu-bzang reports that in his paternal clan (Phyug-tshang)there have been spirit-mediums for nine generations. He says thathis grandfather Padma and his paternal uncle dKar-bsam were medi-ums for the same deities as himself: rTa-rgo ngo-dmar lha-btsan andRol-pa skya-bdun. None of his eight children work as spirit-medi-ums. Pho-bo chu-bzang says that he knows few details about hisfamily because his father died when he was fifteen years old, andsoon thereafter his mother and sisters left their native region (mTsho-khrid, western Nag-tshang) on pilgrimage to Gangs rin-po-che. Onthe way back, his sisters married in sGer-rtse, so he settled there aswell. He has lived in various parts of Brag-po township before mov-ing to his present location about ten years ago.Pho-bo chu-bzang states that the deities of his paternal lineagefirst possessed him at age eighteen. He says that he was aided by alama in sGer-rtse named Karma yon-tan, also known as Bla-chenrin-po-che. Bla-chen rin-po-che diagnosed that he was being visitedby authentic deities. He performed the rtsa-sgo phye-baceremony forPho-bo chu-bzang, which consisted of ablutions, consecration andbinding the ring fingers while conducting agcodritual.

Althoughthey only spent a very short time together, Bla-chen rin-po-che wasof great benefit to Pho-bo chu-bzang. According to Pho-bo chu-bzang, he was also assisted by a lha-pafrom northern sGer-rtse slightlyolder then himself named bDe-ba, a medium for bDe-skyid rkyang-khra (rKyang-khra). bDe-ba helped teach him how to distinguishbetween thelhaand’dre, and how to ascertain what gnod-pa(harm)was afflicting a patient. bDe-ba passed away several years ago.Pho-bo chu-bzang says that in his early years, he went into trance30 or 40 times a year. During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, hispractice was proscribed and his ritual paraphernalia confiscated. Hetestifies that he did not suffer physical abuse but had to undergo anumber of indoctrination sessions to bring him around to the newsocial and political philosophy. Pho-bo chu-bzang reports sufferingfrom a neurological condition characterized by dizziness since thattime. He says that this illness has had a profound impact on hispractice as alha-pa. Pho-bo chu-bzang believes that it was causedby his inability to channel the deities during the Chinese CulturalRevolution, and the contamination that resulted from being sub-jected to work such as digging holes. He now admits to going intotrance very infrequently, in part due to his advanced age. Even whenhe does perform, the patient must erect his own tent on his premisesand has no direct contact with him. Pho-bo chu-bzang states thathe performs the trance in a solitary fashion in his own tent.Like most of the other elderly lha-paof Upper Tibet, Pho-bo chu-bzang is illiterate and conducts all invocations to the deities by mem-ory. He says that it is only when possessed that he can describe theappearance of the deities. He affirms that the main function of pos-session is to cure the ailments of people and livestock. Pho-bo chu-bzang notes that at the beginning of the ceremony prayers are saidto the Buddha, Gu-ru rin-po-che and his consort Ye-shes mtsho-rgyal, dPal-ldan lha-mo, and sGrol-ma. He says that these deitiesprotect and oversee the trance ceremony, and insure that it is aus-picious. Pho-bo chu-bzang uses a ∂a-ma-ruandsil-snyen(flat-bell sim-ilar to the gshang). He believes that the deities who possess him enterthrough the thumb and ring finger while he plays these instruments.He adds that at the moment of possession, his sems-blo(conscious-ness) is conveyed to the lha-yul(celestial realm of the gods) for safe-keeping until the termination of the trance.Pho-bo chu-bzang reports that he used to have a me-long, which"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"interviews conducted with spirit-mediums171154The name of this head covering and other evidences we have examined indi-cate that this kerchief is a vestigial turban.

He explainsthat these forces are appeased and enticed with offerings to stoptheir disservice, or dispelled using mantras. He uses mantras toempower black sand while it is being heated. This sand can bethrown on patients or applied to wounds, swellings and infections.Pho-bo chu-bzang observes that in the past, he would visit a flockof sheep suffering from an epidemic and, while in trance, scatterthis sand (which he had prepared earlier) on the animals. He alsouses mantras to empower clay pellets called za-sngags. The clay usedfor this purpose must be gathered from a special place. It is thenmixed with water and rolled into small balls. Pho-bo chu-bzangwould then say mantras over them while in trance and distributethem to his patients. He believes thatza-sngagsare effective in awide range of disorders. He also thinks that cures can be effectedbybkab-mgo, the touching of a patient’s head with the∂a-ma-ruorsil-snyen.bDug-pa(fumigation) using juniper,gangs-spos(a herb foundaround Gangs ti-se) and other aromatic substances is another heal-ing technique of the trance.

It is then brought insideand mixed with herbs and a piece of cloth blessed by one of thepossessing deities. Pho-bo chu-bzang notes that while possessed, heoccasionally carries out mantic activities using his rosary or dice.According to Pho-bo chu-bzang, the original four spirit-mediumsof Tibet were called Phyogs-bzhi dpa’ bo. He had heard that amember of this lineage named rDza-dmar dpa’ chen cured a Karma-pa lama from poisoning. Pho-bo chu-bzang reports that several yearsprior, an eleven year old girl from the township headquarters wentmissing, and a lama divined that she had been abducted by the ’drespirits. After two weeks had passed, local township officials and thegirl’s family called upon Pho-bo chu-bzang to help find her. He wentinto trance and wrested the girl back from the’dre. The next dayshe reappeared in the settlement unharmed. Pho-bo chu-bzang alsoclaims that around nine years ago he came down with a life-threat-ening illness. He went into trance and then took a knife and oper-ated on his sternum. He says that afterwards he did not eat for 28days and his family thought that he was dying, but slowly he fullyrecovered."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"PART THREE: THE MOUNTAIN AND LAKE DEITIES OF THE SPIRIT-MEDIUMSi)gNyan-chen thang-lhaAs we have seen, the mountain god gNyan-chen thang-lha is animportant patron deity of the lha-pa.Moreover, his sons Thang-srasmchor-po and rDo-rje rkyang-khra, are responsible for a good manytrances. gNyan-chen thang-lha is universally viewed as a resplendentwhitefigure, often sitting astride a horse, in the classic iconographyof the lha-ri(divine mountain) yul-lha. As one of Tibet’s premiermountain gods, he serves as an archetypal patriarch, warrior andprotector of the entire Plateau and particularly for Upper Tibet.The text entitled Honors and Praises of Thang-lha, attributed to theEighth century Bon master sTong-rgyung mthu-chen, contains a dra-matic description of the mountain divinity.1gNyan-chen thang-lhais depicted in his indigenous form as the world’s chief warrior armedwith bow and arrow, and wearing a bird feather on his head.2Hisarmy of white soldiers yell out the ancient Tibetan battle cry, ki bsocha. However, in what appears to be a concession to Buddhist tra-dition, the explanation of his attributes include reference to thabs shes(skillful means and wisdom), precursory conditions for enlightenment:31The written form of this text is entitled Thang lha’i mchod stod(=bstod) (NewCollection of Bon bka’ brten, vol. 87, nos. 1421, ln. 3 to 1423, ln. 3). According toits colophon, it was hidden at Sham-po gang (= gangs) and rediscovered by rMa-lha rgod-thog. However, for translation, I have used a transcription of an oral ver-sion of the text, which is attributed to sTong-rgyung mthu-chen. The oral textcontains a few extra words among the verses and more extensive commands forthe deity to carry out. In 1999, I collected it from the bard (local dialect: spo-spo),Lhun-grub tshe-ring (born circa 1920) of the Grom-dar clan, in the Bon enclaveof sPo-che, gNam-ru (dPal-mgon county). In addition to transmitting local lore,Lhun-grub tshe-ring was a spirit-medium for Ge-sar until 1959.2The Na-khi ngaw(apparently identical with the Tibetan dgra-lha) wear the feath-ers of eagles and black vultures in their helmets, and carry swords and eagle clawsas weapons (Rock 1972: Plate XXXVI).3The physical appearance and attire of Zhang-zhung masters have also beenamalgamated to the Buddhist-like higher teachings of Bon.

It begins with the lineageof deities from which Thang-lha originated (para i). This theogonyaffirms the generative power of the female kluandsmanand themalelha, a native cultural theme usually expressed in terms of adualistic universe divided into upper and lower spheres. In the oraltradition, the fundamental cosmogonic principles are the male deitiesof the upper world and the female deities of the underworld, whichmate to form the universe or various elements within it. In this tex-tual account the union is couched in the more sophisticated doctri-nal language of the joining of minds (thugs yid ’dres-pa).Thang-lha’s appearance as a khyungin the text (paras i, ii) findsstrong resonance in the tradition of spirit-mediumship, whose circleof remedial spirits assume this form. Thang-lha inherits magical toolsfrom his divine grandfather, which appear to have a protective andlineage-identifying function (para ii). Among them are implementsmade ofthog[lcags] and gnam-lcags(celestial iron), which as we haveseen, are highly prized by the lha-pafor use in their ceremonies.9These metallic alloys are also used by other powerful Bon deities.For example, the great protectress Srid-pa’i rgyal-mo has a swordfashioned from gnam-lcags, which she uses to cut the life-force of ene-mies. The Bon tutelary deity Me-ri has a helmet, armor, sword, andax made of gnam-lcags. In an essay written by the renowned scholarNamkhai Norbu, he has this to say about the subject (1996: 108–110):10Thog-lcagsandgnam-lcagswere made in ancient times and are found inmany forms. They include instruments of the rten(tabernacles) for thedivine protectors and wer-ma(class of martial spirit). They also includeancient utensils for eating and drinking; ornaments for males andfemales; articles for funerals, eliminating demons and treating disease;instruments needed for computations, divination and therapy; as wellas objects for hunting and fighting. Presently, only small amounts andfragments remain of what the ancients used, and we do not often rec-ognize their functions. Now seen as wonderful things, most Tibetansbelieve that they came from thog(molten metal thunderbolts) falling9For lore and photographs of these artifacts see Bellezza 1998.10This is a translation of selected passages on thog-lcagsandgnam-lcags, as are thefollowing two paragraphs."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"178part three from the sky. gNam-lcagsare thought to have come from space and tobe the instruments of the lha, gnyan and subterranean klu.

Some of them were hidden as treasure.

The yak is an animal species that the spirit-medium’s helping spirits commonly appear in. For instance, the divinewhite yak frequently participates in fortune-bestowing rituals. In thetext, the yak son is attributed with subduing the btsan, which areimplicated by the lha-pain disease-causing activities.

Among its contents are colorful references toThang-lha’s son and circle of animals, instrumental figures in thespirit-medium traditions of Upper Tibet.The ancient bardic prosody,34as featured in the ’Dzam gling spyibsangs, is characterized by the ample usage of assonant trisyllabicindicators of sound (onomatopoeias), movement and form, as well aslines composed of a regular number of syllables (tshigs-bcad). Rhythmis dramatically dictated by the placement of the highly descriptivetrisyllabic indicators at the end of verses. Examples include khrol lolo(a clanking sound), me re re(overflowing water) and thibs se thibs(all-sparkling or a swirling motion). In Tibetan prosody words usedprimarily for their sound value are called sgra-rgyan(‘sound ornament’).3534The origin of the bardic tradition is related in the late 12th century Buddhistreligious history Chos ’byung me tog snying po sbrang rtsi’i bcud, by Nyang-ral nyi-ma’od-zer (1124–1192?) (for further bibliographic information see Martin 1997, pp.30, 31). It states (p. 160): “The first king of Tibet was the lord gNya’ khri btsan-po. During his reign began the oral tradition, the bardic tradition, poetry, bka’ kugs(?), dance, song, the shonperformance*, and popular entertainment, etc.” (bod kyirgyal po la snga ba rje gnya’ khri btsan po yin te / de’i sku ring la / gtam rgyud dang /sgrung rgyud dang / sdeb sbyor dang / bka’ kugs dang / bro gar dang / glu gzhas dang /shon rtsed dang / rtsed ’jo la sogs pa byung ba yin no /).* A song and dance tradition, which according to the Bon-po, began in Zhang-zhung. The shonstill survives in far western Tibet and Khu-nu.35dGon-chung rab-brtan (2003) provides a passage from a Tun-huang manu-script (unfortunately, he provides no bibliographic data or narrative context), whichincludes four lines with trisyllabic indicators: 1) dgung skar ni si li li/ “Ah, in themiddle of the sky the stars si li li(conveys that the stars are twinkling)”; 2) brag dkarni si li li/ “Ah, the white rock si li li(conveys that the formation is sparkling)”; 3)’bras drug ni si li li/ “Ah, the grain crop si li li (conveys the rippling of the graincrop in the wind)”; and 4) skyi bser ni spu ru ru/ “Ah, the breeze spu ru ru (con-veys the buffeting of the breeze)”. dGon-chung rab-brtan argues that this ancientsystem of prosody (tshig-rgyan) probably belongs to a tradition known as bskor-ba’irgyan(the ornamentation or poetry of repeating words), which consists of the rep-etition or circling of a single word to describe an image or action. In Pelliot 1134(Choix de Documents Tibétains Conservés à la Bibliothèque Nationale Complété par QuelquesManuscrits de L’ India Office et du British Museum, vol.

In order to maintain the standard number of syllables, extrawords and particles that invest no additional semantic weight, areoften interpolated in the verses. A good example is found in para-graph ix of ’Dzam gling spyi bsangs, where the affixbais added to thebdag-sgra(signifying agent) poin,blon-po-ba(minister) and the affixpatodmag-dpon(general) to make up the required amount of syllables.’Dzam gling spyi bsangsbegins with a colorful account of Thang-lha’s celestial castle and the wild animals that guard it (paras i, ii).This great palace is described as possessing many precious substancessuch as gold and turquoise, and it is guarded over by wild animalslike tigers and bear. Jewels and precious metals often figure in litur-gical descriptions about the indigenous pantheon, and constituteofferings presented to them. Likewise, fierce carnivores frequentlyfind mention as members of the circle of mountain deities, and inthe liturgies are ritually offered to the deities. Such motifs conveythe power, majesty and exclusivity of the indigenous pantheon aswell as their possessions and activities. In a related tradition, pre-cious substances and large carnivores were used as symbols of rankand achievement in the Imperial period, according to historical lore.For example, in a late 13th century work entitled Garland of AncientAccounts, by Ne’u pa»∂i-ta, it records the use of such power symbolsin the reign of King Ral-pa-chen (815–841):3736The meter in Sanskrit poetry is dependent upon the sequence of long andshort syllables.

Among his circle of gnyanare the mi-dkar rta-dkar(white men on white horses) (para iv), possessing deities for the twofemale spirit-mediums of this survey, dPa’ mo and sGrol-dkar. Toentice Thang-lha and his retinue to carry out the wishes of the rit-ualists, they are offered a variety of special livestock among otherdelectable offerings (para v). As we have seen, the spirit-mediums ofUpper Tibet often instruct their clients to present choice animals tothe indigenous pantheon in order to win their favor and assistance.The offering of livestock is a widespread custom, with numerousvariations and applications in the region.39The text goes on to mention the warriors flanking each side ofThang-lha (para vi). By their close proximity to Thang-lha thesefigures resemble the pre-Imperial and Imperial era royal priests knownassku-gshen/rgyal-gshen, who protected the lives of the kings and theirsubjects. For example, the rgyal-gshendMu-khri btsan-po is attributedwith using meteoric bombs to destroy the bduddemons (Bellezzaprosody (which hinges upon variant syllable values) could not be fully tailored tothe Tibetan linguistic structure.37sNgon gyi gtam me thog phreng ba, by Ne’u pa»∂i-ta grags-pa smon-lam blo-gros(Bod kyi lo rgyus deb ther khag lnga, edited by Chab-spel tshe-brtan phun-tshogs), p. 8.This text was authored in the Water Sheep Year, most probably corresponding to1283 (p. 2).

Next, the text specifies Thang-lha’s close relatives, includ-ing his father, two wives, younger brother, son and maternal uncle(paras vii, viii). ) Thang-lha is referred to as a sku-lha(personal/bodydeity) (para viii), an epithet for important lha-ri(mountain gods). Asnoted this term for mountain deities can be traced to the Tun-huangmanuscripts, and is related to their protection of the kings. This isfollowed by an enumeration of Thang-lha’s ministers, generals, sis-ter and herders (paras ix, x). Thang-lha’s family members and sub-jects are endowed with names derived from native tradition, whichreflects the existence of an ancient sacred geographical network ofdeities extending across much of the eastern Byang-thang.Three of Thang-lha’s mountain generals (dmag-dpon) of the fourcardinal directions hold different colored ru-dar(triangular ensigns orregimental banners) aloft. In keeping with this scheme, we can inferthat the fourth btsangeneral of the west Khong-khyim zhal-dkar car-ries a red ru-dar. These war banners are a symbol of leadership thatare used to signal the mountain gods’ circle of spirit-helpers. Alsoknown as ru-mtshonanddbal-dar, they are the customary attribute ofmany indigenous deities. According to Tibetan historical lore, thegenerals of the Imperial period (629–846) army used the same typeof military flag. Another hallmark of the majestic power of the chiefnative divinities is the use of specially marked and colored horses.Likewise, as symbols of their lofty status, Imperial period generalsare also thought to have ridden horses with particular colors andpatterns. I subscribe to the hypothesis that this interrelated martialtradition of flags and special horses for the indigenous pantheon andImperial period commanders is a relic of pre-Imperial culture. Itwould appear to me that such a daedal and far-reaching custom andtradition had long historical antecedents. The 13th century historymKhas pa lde’u (pp. 259–261), gives a description of the horses andbanners of the commanders (variously called stong-dpon, dmag-dponandru-dpon) of the Ru-chen sde-bzhi, the Four Wings of Tibet,40whichhave definite parallels in the ritual texts for the indigenous deities.The eight commanders are presented as residents of the four cardi-nal directions and four intermediate points, a mode of spatial pre-sentation common to ritual literature as well.40They are: g.Yas-ru (centered in Shangs rnam-gling), dBu (dBus) ru (centeredin Lhasa), g.Yo (g.Yon) ru (centered in Yar-lung), and Ru-lag (centered in sBradkyi ngur-pa sna).

It is their role as cosmogo-nicfigures that gave rise to the great clans, in which the nativedivinitiesfind their most intimate connection with the Tibetans. Myinquiries show however, that in Upper Tibet (as in most other Tibetancultural regions), the cultural expressions of the ancestral functionsof the mountains and lakes are now nearly extinct. It would appearthat centuries of Buddhist doctrinal inculcation and the impositionof the Indian pantheon and cosmogonies have largely erased the ear-lier collective memory of the mountain and lake progenitors. In mostBon and Buddhist ritual literature, recognition of these forebears hasbeen reduced to a convention whereby the indigenous deities receivetitles such as a-myes(grandfather),yum, A-ma(mother),jo-bo(elderbrother), and jo-mo(elder sister). Nevertheless, the extant indigenouscosmogonies found in works such as mKhas pa lde’uanddBu nag mi’u’dra chags, as well as other sources,91espouse the view that bothTibetans and their native divinities originated from the celestial phywaanddmudeities.It is as sacred ancestors that the human-like personality and activ-ities of the indigenous pantheon are best understood. Just like humanmembers of society, the deities are thought to both help and hin-der by the various transactions they engage in. In the native con-text, the lha-paof Upper Tibet embody not just the spirits of greatmasses of rock and water, but the essence of their people, in a rela-tionship that potentially pre-dates lamaist forms of religion. As heal-ers, counselors, generals, and prophets these divinities articulate theironeness with human beings through a common ancestry.

It should be noted that there are severalTibetan manuscripts from Nepal that accord the lDong clan a central role in theorigin myth of the Tamang (Ramble 2003: 75, 76).93The ancient ancestral function of Thang-lha is dimly recognized in a popularfolktale of sNying-drung, ’Dam-gzhung county: Sometime in the past, a woman ofthe Seng-tshang family was weaving inside her tent. Hail began to fall gently fromthe sky and some entered her tent through the gung-khebs(sky-flap) and fell on herlap. She also swallowed some of the hail, and in due course she gave birth toThang-lha’s son. Another version of the story has it that this woman slept with themountain god in her dreams. The result of this union was a son named Senggedmag-dpon (Lion General), who grew up to be very powerful and handsome. Hewas the area’s natural leader, and would guide caravans up north to collect saltbecause he could protect his people from bandits. When the traders would taketheir salt down south to exchange for grain, Sengge dmag-dpon and his yaks couldcross the Yar-lung gtsang-po without the aid of a ferry. Once he went to Yar ’brogg.yu-mtsho, passing by the mountain of a local gzhi-bdagcalled mGar-rtse lha-mo.It was customary for travelers to dismount in front of this mountain, out of respectfor the goddess, but Sengge dmag-dpon rode right past, angering her.

The contents arealso marked by faulty and uncertain spellings, compounding difficultiesof comprehension. The parochial spelling rus-rug(six clans) for rus-drugis a telltale sign that the writer was a sTod-skad (Western Tibetdialect) speaker, where it is commonplace to pronounce ‘six’ as asecond syllable in this manner. The ambiguity permeating the chainof cosmogonic events in the Pha rabsseems to suggest that when acertain Lama mThar-phyin committed it to writing, the traditionhad already undergone some degeneration. Clearly, the lore con-tained within was allied to the ancient bardic tradition, which wasprobably preserved by a class of religious functionaries known aspha-jo. The white turban-clad pha-joare still active in western Nepalwhere they carry out clan related rituals.94ThePha rabsappears todocument the emigration of members of the lDong clan into Nepal.This migrant group probably originally hailed from the greater gNyan-chen thang-lha region, as the preponderance of deities fromthis area implies. The indigenous cultural content of the text andthe archaic phraseology in which it is couched, may well demon-strate that its preservers came to Nepal before the second diffusionof Buddhism (bstan-pa phyi-dar).95It is the Tamang ethnic groups inNepal that are closely identified with the lDong clan, and the Pharabsunder examination is one of their genealogical texts.it with the animal’s intestines. He then fired three arrows (alternatively three bul-lets) at the gsas-mkhar, causing the goddess in the form of a black cat to jump outand run away. From that time on, the spirit-mediums for mGar-rtse lha-mo couldno longer embody her.94For example, in the village of Ros, in Nub-ri, the dPon-bzang and Yur-konglineages still have pha-jo(Tshe-dbang bstan ’dzin and Tshe-ring dbang-rgyal respec-tively). The two pha-joprepare offerings for the eight local ancestral and protectivespirits, which figure in Ros’s three lha-bsangs(propitiation of gods with incense) obser-vances, held between the second and fourth lunar months. The pha-joalso raise thepho-shing(father wood), the central mast of the lha-dar(flags for the yul-lhasPung-rgyan) during the Lo-gsar (New Year) celebration. This information was collectedduringfieldwork in 1998, conducted in conjunction with Dr. GeoffChilds.95There are oral traditions preserved in Nepal tracing the movement of Tibetansinto the Himalaya in the aftermath of the fall of Imperial Tibet. For instance, thehighest status lineage of Nub-ri, the mNga’ bdag, claim their descent from minis-ters of the sPu-rgyal state who came to the region with the collapse of dynasticrule.200part three"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"the mountain and lake deities of the spirit-mediums201ThePha rabsdispenses with the elaborate cosmogonic progressioninvolving the coming of existence and the celestial phywaanddmudeities found in the more extensive indigenous origin myths of Tibet.Instead it begins with ’O-lde gung-rgyal, a mountain deity who is adescendant of the phywa. Among his five children is gNyan-chenthang-lha (Thang-lha yab-bzhur), who through his scion Thang-srasmchor-po and his granddaughter, appear to give birth to the lDongclan (paras i, ii). The Pha rabsinsists that other well known moun-tain divinities that descended from ’O-lde gung-rgyal, such as rMa-chen pom-ra (A-mdo), ’Bri-lam gangs-bzang (near Thang-lha) andLha-lcam kham-pa (west side of gNam-mtsho), disappeared into thesky and thus did not partake in the creation of humans. The textclearly favors gThang-lha and Thang-sras mchor-po (located imme-diately north of his father). The cosmogonic sequence expoundedafter the appearance of the goddess Thogs dog-mo is not certain(para iii). It appears that she may be the maternal ancestor of thelDong because she remains behind, presumably to serve as the pro-genetrix of the clan. After her, the scion of the lDong, Lha-mu khri-khrig-ka, leaves the heavens and descends to Gangs-dkar sha-medmountain (para iii).Pha rabsnow skips to four other members of the four or six proto-clans of Tibet:96sTong, ’A-zha, Zhang-zhung-smra, and Sum-pa,which reside on different parts of a metaphorical tree (paras iv–vi).Three of these four clans have a totemic clan animal: ’A-zha—smallbrown musk deer; Zhang zhung —conch white male elephant; andSum-pa—iron female yak hybrid. In the contemporary period, thetradition of clan animals in Upper Tibet is virtually defunct. I havediscovered faint traces of a totemic tradition in the contiguous Rus’thor (’Brong-pa county) and Seng ’khor (sGer-rtse county), regionsthat are renowned for having the highest proportion of older clansand clan traditions in the Byang-thang (Dang-ra g.yu-mtsho notwith-standing).

As indi-cated by the Pha rabs, they may have once also held an ancestral function for theclans. Contemporary Upper Tibetans often confuse rus-lhawithpho-lhaandphugs-lha, but these latter two types of gods are mainly personal and household protectors."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"dPon-pa clan is dPon-btsan kham-nag (Dark Brown Leader bTsan),a deity in the circle of A-myes rma-chen. An indication that thesewere zoomorphic rus-lhais that the kinds of color adjectives used todescribe them are customarily applied to animals. The inclusion ofhorns on one of the gods is also an excellent indication.98In theremote valleys of the Nepal Himalaya, zoomorphic rus-lhaare stillpresent in contemporary Bodic cultures. My fieldwork in Nub-rishows that the three lower status (older) lineages of dPon-bzang, Yur-kong and Chung-dman/Phyugs-min have clan deities (locally calledpho-lha) with white sheep and bay-colored yak (g.yag-kham-pa) mani-festations. Similarly, the four clans of the Thakali of the Kali Gandakivalley have clan deities in zoomorphic forms, including a coloredbird, lioness, elephant, and chu-srin(crocodile-like water-spirit), whichappear on a sandalwood tree (Gauchan and Vinding 1977: 110–113).These latter three deities control the rain, wind, clouds and moun-tains; and the fertility of crops and living beings (ibid.: 118).Pha rabsgoes on to list four pairs of clans, asserting that each pairshares a common origin (para vi). This is followed by alternativeclan and lineage classifications, the most intriguing of which are theclans of the Thirteen Grandmothers (Phyi-mo bcu-bsum).99Thisostensibly was an ancient matrilineal and/or matriarchal clan tradi-tion.100Similarly, a matrilineal tradition may be implicit in the textentitledVoice of the Sky Dragon: Cloud Offerings of the Great gNyan of the98Numerous interviews with senior Seng ’khor and dPon-pa clan members estab-lish that they are no longer aware of the iconography of their rus-lha.99Myfieldwork has demonstrated that in Gu-ge (rTsa-mda’ county), there is aclass of dominant yul-lhathat carries the appellation I-pi(grandmother). These deitiescome in the form of I-pi klu-moandI-pi lha-mo, and sometimes share a valley ter-ritory with a btsandeity.Among the most famous examples are I-pi gyam-nye ofmDa’ pa*, I-pi brag-skyed kyo-sgo srungs-ma of gSer-gam*, I-pi Mug-gyam gyi kha-la-ma of sBa-lu mkhar*, and I-pi dkar-sman and I-pi ser-gyu of Ma-nam.* The spellings for these three deities came from the inscriptions accompanyingtheir frescos at the Mang-brag cave temple (14th century?), in Gu-ge.100Gibson (1995: 254, 255), on the basis of the naming of the six Tibetan kingswho succeeded King gNya’ khri after their mothers and the customary interven-tion of queens on behalf of their younger sons, argues that this suggests maternalclans exerted significant influence on the royal institution. He also notes from thisevidence and the nature of polyandrous alliances, that the sacral element of king-ship may have been passed on through the female line, if not an actual matrilin-eal system of kingship being in place. Dr. Charles Ramble (in personal communication)reports that a text that seems to preserve a matrilineal dynastic succession hasrecently surfaced.202part three"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"the mountain and lake deities of the spirit-mediums203Slate[Mountains]and Meadows.101In this nominally Buddhacized gsol-kha,only a grandmother is provided as the ultimate ancestor ofgNyan-chen g.ya’ spangs, an important yul-lhaof Shan-rtsa.

These same themes are found inthe introductory cho-rabs(mythic origins) section of a text entitledUnabridged Offerings to the Lha and Purification of the Lha of the Four Typesof Little People.116The pan-Tibetan clan lore found in these two worksseems to reflect the formation of a national identity or conscious-ness. At the least, these collective genealogical myths of origin indi-cate the development of a far-ranging interrelated social and culturalframework in old Tibet. It is my view that a common ancestral iden-tity based on a shared mythos as promoted in these texts, probablydeveloped in the Imperial period when the entire Tibetan plateauwas welded together in a single empire. I am inclined to see suchmyths as having been used to facilitate the cultural and ethnicunification of Imperial Tibet and the concomitant creation of a sin-gle polity.Unabridged Offerings to the Lha and Purification of the Lha of the FourTypes of Little Peoplefeatures rites of purification for humans and theirpersonal deities known as sel. The selis performed to restore the bal-ance between individuals and the deities, which has been upset bythe contaminating influence of impure actions such as sme/dme(murder of relatives), mnol(defilement resulting from environmental contamination) and nal(incest) (cf. Norbu 1995: 106; Karmay and116Mi’u rigs bzhi lha sel lha mchod rgyas pa, folios 1b, ln. 1 to 4a, ln. 5. A photo-graphic reproduction of this manuscript of 23 folios is found in Karmay and Nagano2002.

After providing the myth of origins, the text out-lines the liturgical structure of the selritual, which includes confession,invitation of the deities and requests for protection. This outline isfollowed by the story of the bon-gshen(priests) who wear ber-chen(longrobes), tie white turbans on their heads and drink a type of nectarcalledA-ti. These priests purified the deities by the smoke of whiteincense. The ritualists then invite the deities by gtor-ma, incense, awhiteflag, an arrow with white vulture feathers, and nine types ofcloth. Among the deities invited are the pho-lha, mo-lhaandbu-rdzi(babysitter), who are asked to manifest as seven golden birds on topof castles of gold, silver, turquoise, conch and agate. They arespecifically requested to bestow children in the lap, livestock outside,the capability to have children (sri) deep inside the house, and wealthin the hand. The deities are purified with incense before offeringsof beer, ’brang-rgyasandbshod(kinds of gtor-ma), libations, jewels andgrain are made to them. By waving flags, blowing conches, beatingdrums, and burning incense deities such as the pho-lha, mo-lha, dgra-lha, srog-lha, zhang-lha, and yul-lhaare invited from their various cas-tles. These divinities are offered the thrones of the crow, tiger, whitefemale vulture, white female lion, elephant, and a camel with a whitemouth, all of which have seats of conch.The next series of offerings mentioned in the text are thirteendivine arrows, which have new feathers and cloths, unbroken bam-boo shafts and points that are not rusted. These arrows function astherten(support) for the lhaanddgra-lha. Thirteen other articles arealso installed as the rtenincluding the following livestock: a lightorange horse, divine white yak and red-faced divine sheep with ver-milion swastika.

The text alsoreminds the ritualists of the essential value of the performance (para i).The actual cho-rabsbegins with a description of a primal god whohad a lhain the form of a vulture (bya-rgod) ornamented with adivine arrow (lha-mda’), divine barley (lha-nas) and a divine stone (lha-rdo) (para ii). Upon descending to earth this vulture and its accou-trements were installed as the first divine altar or ritual foundation(lha-gzhi) (paras ii, iii). The text then skips to the four proto-clans andthe protective deities they received as their divine allotment (lha-skal)(para iv). Next the text divides the four proto-clan lineages into eightindividual clans, and also notes that there are three orders of birdsand thirteen countries (para v).Od-de gung-rgyal and his consort sMan-dag btsun-mo give birthtofive types of eggs, which each produce a different species of bird(paras vi, vii). These birds act as emissaries between humans andtheir clan deities (para viii).

The divine arrow was erected on the tail of the vulture sooriginated its blue tail. The divine altar was kept underneath the vul-ture so originated the felt-carpeted divine altar.

No author ordiscoverer is mentioned,128and the content of the text offers fewclues as to the antiquity or geographic orientation of Hur-pa. Thiswork is composed in a style analogous to that used for the higherprotectors of Buddhism, in which there is a preoccupation with thedefense of religious doctrines.The tone of language in this Hur-pa text is strident and highlyaggressive. This btsanis portrayed as a merciless killer, disposing ofall those who oppose the Bon doctrine. In the text the terrible wrathof the deity is directed against apostates. Hur-pa has an awesomeappearance and a huge army of acolytes who do his bidding. Withhis turban, armor, tiger-skin quiver and leopard-skin bow case (para ii)his guise is that of the traditional warrior of Tibet, prevalent sinceancient times. Other salient features of native lore in the text includeHur-pa’s display of the dbal-darbanner and ancient war cries (parasii–iv). Conversely, a religious feature such as the lha-srin sde-brgyadclassification of spirits (para v) is adopted from Buddhist tradition.While apparently not a possessing deity of the lha-paof Upper Tibet,the language used to describe Hur-pa’s btsanpersona and violentactivities are reminiscent of that used in exorcisms, where evil spir-its are dispatched. Except for a few closing mantras, the text in itsentirety reads:128Nos. 608–612 of a manuscript volume containing general instructions for con-ducting rituals, entitled Nyer mkho ’dod ’jo ’khri shing.

Alsoreferred to simply as rKyang-khra (Variegated-Colored Onager), hisresidence is widely recognized as a small hill in the midst of a largeplain north of dPa’ mtsho, in gNam-ru (dPal-mgon county). Theonly text dedicated solely to rKyang-khra appears to be the oneattributed to the great ’Bri-gung-pa hierarch sKyob-pa ’jig-rten mgon-po (1143–1217), entitled rKyang khra gsol kha.136The manuscript avail-able to me came from the great spirit-medium of gNam-ru, Pho-bolha-dbang (see Part Two, section xi). It was passed down from hisfather.rKyang khra gsol khaconforms with the standard formula of invo-catory texts for indigenous deities: apology, offerings, and requests.It belongs to the Buddhist stylistic phase of ritual literature, in whichrKyang-khra is shorn of his geographic underpinnings.

As such, the sectarian orientationof this text contrasts with the many Bon works in this study. rKyangkhra gsol kha contains little archaic lore or verses of indigenous poetry.It does however, make ample reference to the Buddhist worldviewand practice. The text features an apology to rKyang-khra and hiscircle of deities and other spirits, worded in a way commonly directedto higher Buddhist gods (para i). The offering ensemble is of thetype traditionally given to the class of more powerful Buddhist pro-tectors (para ii). While meat is offered to the deity, it is in the formof a cooked meal, not raw. Among the many wild animals presentedto the deity is an onager with a white muzzle (para iii). Althoughit is not noted in the text, this type of animal is the customary mountof rKyang-khra. rKyang-khra is the most famous deity in UpperTibet associated with the endemic onager. Given the lore generallyprevailing in Upper Tibet, it seems likely that he sometimes appearedin the form of this animal. The indigenous religious position of theonager may have been related to regional clan origins, as possiblysuggested by its solitary depiction in the rock art of Upper Tibet.In standard Buddhist liturgical practice, offerings are first madeto the Buddhas before they are given to lesser protectors (para iii).In this case, the primordial Buddha is invoked. In a clear parallel,the liturgies of the spirit-mediums also call upon and offer gifts tothe Buddhas as a prelude to the invocation of the deities of thetrance. An essential part of the gsol-khaliterary genre are the requestsfor worldly success and protection (para iv), which are traditionallydispensed by the environment-based pantheon. Quite typically, theritualists ask to be free from misfortune, epidemics and poverty (parasiv, v) These requests reflect the powers ascribed to rKyang-khra inspirit-mediumship.

However, lamaist (Tibetan ecclesi-astic) modification is minimal, and is only exhibited in some of theoffering articles and the wording of certain passages.The rTa-rgo gods and other deities of Tibet’s native pantheonshare their iconography and functions in common with the legendaryBon masters of primordial and Zhang-zhung times. They wear thesame types of garments, possess the same resplendent bodies of var-ious colors and hold the same attributes in their hands. Their for-tune-bestowing and apotropaic activities are also similar. This comesas no surprise for these human and preternatural figures belong tothe same corpus of Bon tradition.

His consort also had argyal-mtshan(victory banner), which in various forms, is a commonattribute of deities as well. The legendary early tantric master gSang-ba ’dus-pa wielded a sword and bow, as do the rTa-rgo deities andmany other btsanandlha-ri. His consort bSen thub-ma held a thog-mda’(thunderbolt arrow) and skullcap full of blood, attributes remi-niscent of lake and tantric deities. This couple subdued the enemiesof the Bon Doctrine and removed the life-force of the bdudanddregs-pa(‘haughty ones’), functions also popularly carried out by the deities.Another early gshen, Lha-bon yongs-su dag-pa, had a bright whitecolor and bound a red turban on his head, just like the rTa-rgogods and other native divinities. He and his consort ’Od ’phro-macouldfly in the sky like birds, an activity of the deities as well.

They also rode ri-dwags(wild ungulates)andflew like birds."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"the mountain and lake deities of the spirit-mediums225Lha chen rta sgo’i mchod bskangbegins with a poetic description ofthe mountain rTa-rgo, with its references to the weather, the beau-tiful form of the mountain, and the wild animals it hosts (paras i, ii).This is followed by an enumeration of his parents and brotherhood(paras iii, iv). His origins are attributed to a male lhaand a femaleklu, a cosmogonic theme of ancient times, but instead of simply mat-ing, the deities are derived from a doctrinal principle closely associ-ated with Vajrayana Buddhist tradition: the union of thabs(skillfulmeans) and shes-rab(wisdom). The text proceeds to detail a largeassembly of objects offered to rTa-rgo (paras v–x). While the lha-pado not indulge in such elaborate offerings to the deities, we perhapsget some idea of what their ancient altars might have looked like.According to popular Tibetan tradition, the lha-pawere once mightypractitioners, with many resources at their disposal. The drum andgshangare among the offerings specified that satisfy the desires ofrTa-rgo (paras viii, xii). In addition to offering articles of Indianinspiration, such as the dpag-bsams-shing(wish-fulfilling tree) rgyal-sridrin-chen sna-bdun(seven precious articles of royal sovereignty) and ’dod’jo-ba(cow yielding all desires) (para v), a large variety of animalsindigenous to Upper Tibet are presented to the deities (paras vi, vii).These include many of the animals used by the lha-paas spirit helpers.The war-like nature of the rTa-rgo brotherhood is clearly reflectedin the armaments that they are offered (para viii). The mda ’dar ispresented as another gift (para viii); its affinity with indigenous deitiessuch as rTa-rgo helps to explain its widespread usage by the spirit-mediums who wave it around, just as described in this text. Lha chenrta sgo’i mchod bskangalso notes the objects given to rTa-rgo’s con-sorts and other deities in his entourage (paras xi–xvi), the goddessmates being particularly well represented in the invocations of thespirit-mediums of Upper Tibet. This wide circle of deities representsa significant portion of the native pantheon of the central Byang-thang. Among the most enigmatic member of rTa-rgo’s retinue isBya-dkar grags-pa (Famous White Bird) (para xii). The identity ofthis divine figure is no longer clear but as we have learned, birdsare an integral part of the entourages of mountain gods, which areused in the service of the spirit-mediums. Among the gifts offeredto rTa-rgo’s circle is a golden arrow to a male deity and a turquoisespindle (phang) to a female deity (para xiii). These objects constituteancient Tibetan symbols of manhood and womanhood respectively.In a myth of origins, a Bon marriage text records that two turquoise"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"226part three arrows, a golden arrow and a golden spindle originated from threeheavenly eggs, which came into being through the union of Phywa-gang g.yang-grags and Srid-pa’i bzang-ma (Karmay 1998: 150).The prominence of rTa-rgo in the sacred geography of the Byang-thang is underscored by the fact that the Rol-pa rkya/skya-bdun arerecorded as being a part of his entourage (para xiv). The analogyof vassal kings under the authority of an emperor is quite appro-priate to illustrate the varying degrees of power and influence ofthese divine lords. In the next section, Lha chen rta sgo’i mchod bskangcalls attention to the endowments and protections expected of rTa-rgo and his entourage, in exchange for the gifts they have beenoffered (para xvii). Reflecting the priorities of thelha-pa, the first ofthese requests seeks protection from disease and the enlisting of rTa-rgo as the divine physician. Great stress is also placed on the utterdestruction of foreign armies by rTa-rgo (paras xvii–xxv). The wayin which this activity is continually repeated in the text may havesomething to do with the writing of the Lha chen rta sgo’i mchod bskangin the aftermath of the 13th century Mongol conquest of the region.The next part of the text describes the costume, equipment andmounts of the rTa-rgo brotherhood, which have distinctive martialovertones (paras xviii–xxv). These mounted warriors—with their bowsand arrows and shields—reflect customs of war that have long pre-vailed in Tibet, as attested in both Bon textual references and therock art record. The rTa-rgo brotherhood’s fierce appearance andpersonality helps to explain why the lha-paoften behave violentlywhile under the influence of these deities. Each member of the broth-erhood controls a particular type of disease and harm-causing ele-mental spirit; homeopathically, they are responsible for preventingthe illnesses and misfortunes emanating from them.Near its conclusion, the text contains offerings to the animals inrTa-rgo’s circle and statements asserting the privileged status of theritualist (para xxvi). Presentation of the ensemble of ritual offeringsto the animal helpers of rTa-rgo, such as lions, tigers, leopards,wolves, bears, birds, and wild yaks underlines the important mythicrole these animals have had in ’brog-paculture probably since timeimmemorial. At the very least, these animals are entreated for util-itarian ends; to prevent the herds of livestock from being preyedupon by predators. More importantly, however, their close associa-tion with the divine rTa-rgo, as divinities in their own right, illus-"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"the mountain and lake deities of the spirit-mediums227trates archaic aspects of Upper Tibet religion especially as typifiedin the tradition of spirit-mediumship.Of special note is the mi-dred, which is literally a half-human andhalf-brown bear figure (para xxvi). In the vernacular of Upper Tibet,the term mi-dredis also used to describe the animal dred/dred-mo/dred-mong, the Tibetan subspecies of brown bear.153In Upper Tibet it iscommonly believed that the bear, marmot and human have the sameancestry because they can stand on two legs. This kind of belief isalso recorded in a Bon ritual text where it states, “The prince ofexistence ’Thing-ge...coupled with gNyan-mo to produce apes, mar-mots, brown bear, and mi-dred, these four. These are the four broth-ers who are like humans but are not human.”154Similarly, accordingto the Na-khi, the man, monkey and bear are all of one originbecause they have soles on their feet (Rock 1963a: 414). I havefound that throughout Upper Tibet, there are folk-tales about brownbears (in sTod commonly called rting-ris, rting-dom andrting-stong)abducting women in ancient times and producing children with them.There do not however, appear to be any existing clans that tracetheir lineage to bears. At gNam-mtsho, brown bears of yore are saidto have put on the conical felt hat (phying-zhwa) of the region’s shep-herds (A-pha hor) and signal from afar for a shepherdess to approach.Thinking it was one of her own kind, she would come near and beseized by the bear. He would take her to his lair and the childrenthey produced had both ursine and human characteristics. Sometimesthe woman would escape but she could only take the human partof the child with her. Her husband having rent it asunder kept thebear-half. In accord with such myths, it is sometimes said that brownbears leave the footprints of humans. According to the lha-paPho-bo lha-dbang, in gNam-ru, it is believed that brown bears with whitefaces and partially white pelage resemble humans, and that animalswith this coloration are manifestations ofyul-lhaandgzhi-bdag.

Although the text is attributed to KingKhri-srong lde-btsan (742–797), the inclusion of Kublai Khan in the text, and ref-erences to the Mongols, Chinese and Tibetans being the sons of ’Thing-ge, indi-cates that it was not written before the 13th century (Karmay and Nagano 2002:xi, xii)."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Seng ’khor ma-mig (southern sGer-rtse county), the remnants of anarchaic origin myth regarding the brown bear have been orally pre-served:155In the beginning of time, there were only two male brownbears on the earth. One of them took a srin-moas his wife, begotchildren and lived in the srin-yul. The other brown bear took ahuman wife named rMes-rmes (Ancestress/Grandmother) and begotseven children, the forebears of both bears and humans (at leastsome of them). In my view, the pervasive occurrence of myths thatspeak of a genealogical interrelationship between humans and bearshark back to the earliest tier of the cultural history of Upper Tibet.They belong to what might be called the aboriginal period of cul-tural development in the region, and prehistoric, far-ranging mytho-logical interconnections with north Asia may well be indicated.156In the Bon religion, there is a ritual text for the deity Mi-dred-ma (Bear Woman), a manifestation of the great protectress Srid-pa’irgyal-mo (Queen of Existence).157According to Bon tradition, she isthus called because her mount is a brown bear. It appears likely tome that her creation is a later adaptation of the oral tradition thataffirms a kinship between brown bears and humans. In her text, Mi-dred-ma is described as sitting on a carpet of flayed human skin,amid a castle of bone and a rippling lake of blood, located in themiddle of a terrific cemetery. She is dark red in color, and has threeheads and six arms. She rides a brown bear and subdues the innu-merable worlds. One of the main members of her retinue is Srog-155This myth was shared by the Ma-mig (sGer-rtse county) sngags-paKun-dga’rdo-rje (born circa 1932), well respected for his knowledge of local history and culture.156Likewise, bears are part of far-ranging genealogical lore in northern Asia. InSiberia, the bear cult reflects archaic pre-shamanistic traditions ( Jacobson 1993:183). For example, the supreme deity of the Evenk is Amaka, which means bothpaternal ancestor and bear (Anisimov 1963: 163). In an Evenk origin myth, it isrecorded that certain lineages descended from a girl who had a man and a bearas husbands, in the time before there was the bow and arrow (Vasilevich 1963:68). Likewise, the Tunguz-speaking Golds of east Siberia consider the bear an ances-tor who once coupled with a woman, and pay great respect to it (Baldick 2000:143). This kinship link is also suggested by the practice of young Yakut hunterswho simulate the sexual act on a slain bear (ibid.: 145). Ancestral connections withthe bear are also hinted at in Na-khi funerary rituals. This pertains to the dto-mba(priests) who don a bearskin while erecting the gv-gyi(bear house) prepared for theeffigy of the deceased (Rock 1963a: 149).157Srid rgyal dpon g.yog gi bskang bzhags bdud rtsi’i rgya mtsho, attributed to a teacherof the sGo clan named Kro-ta wer-zhi, (New Collection of Bon bka’ brten, vol. 88,nos. 971–981).228part three"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"the mountain and lake deities of the spirit-mediums229zan nag-mo (Female Black Life-Force Eater), who has dog, wolf, foxand brown bear-headed forms.

She is bright whitein color and rides a nine-headed turquoise dragon. Mi-dred-ma andher circle are recorded as repelling sudden onset diseases, obstaclesto life, foreign enemies, periods of strife epidemics, malignant influencesof the gza’(planetary gods) and klu, defilements of impurity, srieaters[of life], the bdud(demons) of life and misfortune, and the oath-breaking, harming hateful enemies and obstructers.

This mdosritual is a kind of enticement offering, whereby rTa-rgo and Dang-ra and their circles of deities are given pleasing things in order topersuade or coerce them to help realize the desires and needs of theritualists and their benefactors.205This transaction between the deitiesand people involved in the ritual is intended to benefit both partiesby augmenting their well-being and prestige. The mdoscan also beused as a method of restitution if it has been determined that rTa-rgo and Dang-ra have been overstepped or provoked. In this case,the ritualist seeks redress for the individual (or community at large)physically hurt or whose interests were damaged by these deities.The origins of the mdosare described in a text found in the firstvolume (stod-cha) of the sDe brgyad bzlog mdoscollection:206King Mu-khri btsan-po contracted a pernicious disease. The great gshenNam-mkha’ snang-mdog arranged the great mdosof secret space. KingMu-khri was liberated from his blockages (bkag). Afterwards, from wheredoes the mdosoriginate? King gNam-ri blon-btsan (32nd Tibetan King)was infected by diseases of the sa-bdag, kluandgnyan. sTong-rgyungnam-mkha’ (sTong-rgyung mthu-chen) was invited. He made the mdosand repelling ritual (bzlog) of universal existence. King gNam-ri wasliberated from his blockages. Afterwards, from where does the mdosoriginate? The angry yul-lhamade obstacles (bar-chod) for King Khri-srong sde-btsan. Bla-chen dran-pa was invited. He made the blissfulgreatmdosof existence. King Khri-srong was liberated from his blockages.mDosrituals are popularly prescribed by clerics andlha-pato restorethe balance between individuals and the mountain and lake deities.It goes to the heart of how the lha-paand other residents of UpperTibet traditionally perceive the etiology of disease and misfortune,and the way in which they can be alleviated. The mdosfeatures anelaborate construction of the same name that functions as the tem-porary abode of deities while they are serving the ritualist. This con-struction is a microcosm of the world, specifically that of whichrTa-rgo and Dang-ra are a part. In various symbolic forms, it includesthe people, animals and natural resources present in the region.205A general discussion on the mdos,an ancient class of rituals, is found in Tucci1980, pp. 176–187.206SeesPyi rgyug mdos mchod rin chen ’phring (=’phreng)ba(New Collection of Bonbka’ brten, vol. 27, nos. 807–846), no. 816, lns. 2–6.

Like other important btsan, he is inthe guise of a fierce warrior surrounded by his vast swarm of helpersand attendants. The main abode of this deity is located above Chos-sku monastery, immediately west of Gangs rin-po-che. Here is hispho-brang(palace), a colorful rocky mountain called Za ’og gur-khang(Brocade Tent House). A small tarn near the top of this mountainis his bla-mtsho(soul lake). In the various gsol-khatexts belonging tothe rNying-ma and ’Brug-pa sects dedicated to Gangs-ri lha-btsan,no mention of a consort is made. However, his misogynous ten-dencies, a not uncommon quality of btsandeities, are probably exag-gerated. According to what survives of orally-transmitted local lore,"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"his consort is named Klu-mo mdzes-ldan (Beautiful Female Klu), adeity who perhaps dwells in Ma-pham g.yu-mtsho.Given the prevailing cultural patterns of btsangods in Upper Tibet,it appears that Gangs-ri lha-btsan was originally an ancestral pro-tector deity of theyul-lhaclass. However, there does not appear tobe any Bon literature devoted to him. According to Bon lore, Gangs-dkar ti-se was the bla-ri(soul mountain) and mTsho ma-pham thebla-mtsho(soul lake) of the Bon of Zhang-zhung (Gangs-ri-ba 1990:93, 94). This source states that in the time of Tibet’s second kingMu-khri btsan-po, who was also argyal-gshen(royal Bon priest), Ti-se was known as Gangs-gnyan ya-bag sha-ra (ibid.: 93, 94). In thedkar-chagof Ka-dam ye-shes rgyal-mtshan, it relates that in a vision,the author spoke with the Zhang-zhung era saint Shad-bu ra-khug,who told him that when gShen-rab sung the song of the gshenthreetimes on the southwest side of Ti-se, the 300 lha-bonof the sky camedown like rain and sang and danced before him.224At that time,sTon-pa (gShen-rab) gave the name Gangs-dkar ti-se to Gangs-gnyanya-bag sha-ra and Mal-gros bzi-chen mtsho-mo was named Ma-pangg.yu-mtsho. The same text tells us that Gangs-dkar gnyan gyi ti-seoriginated from the lineage of the ma-sangsandgnyan, and was bornas the son of ’O-de gung-rgyal (no. 482).Gangs-ri lha-btsan has become the Buddhist gnas-bdag(master ofthe place) of Gangs rin-po-che and of religious practitioners resid-ing in the area. According to Buddhist tradition, he was conqueredby Gu-ru rin-po-che and made to uphold its religious doctrines. Thishowever, has done little to change his angry nature. Easily provokedandfickle in nature, Gangs-ri lha-btsan is thought of as a danger-ous ally and an implacable foe. However, when his wrath is har-nessed through ritual, such as those conducted by thelha-pa, he isbelieved to bestow material and spiritual boons.To begin with, let us peruse two short texts belonging to therNying-ma sect that find resonance in the longer gsol-khaof the ’Brug-pa bka’ brgyud tradition, which we will examine afterwards. TherNying-ma texts make ample reference to Buddhism, yet they owetheir inspiration to both Indian tantric tradition and indigenous cul-ture. In the Bon reckoning of history, they feature offerings and224Gangs ri mtsho gsum gyi kar(=dkar)chagsby Ka-dam ye-shes rgyal-mtshan (14thcentury) (mDzod phug rtsa ba dang spyi don dang gangs ti se’i dkar chag,nos. 445–489),no. 482.250part three"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"the mountain and lake deities of the spirit-mediums251attributes typical of the btsanthat are derived from pre-Imperial tra-dition. The texts are based on a fabric of nine syllables per line. Inthefirst text, a gsol-kha,225Gangs-ri lha-btsan’s appearance and per-sonality is described as awe-inspiring and praiseworthy. This unti-tled text was written specifically for religious practitioners, but it alsoaddresses more pedestrian concerns related to everyday well being.The age-old themes of a noble guardian of the higher aspects ofreligion and that of the barbarous btsanwarrior looking after theimmediate concerns of his devotees are entwined throughout, as theyare in many gsol-khafor mountain divinities.Thegsol-khawas designed for use with a second text entitled Lhabtsan bskang ba,226which describes the kinds of gifts that must beoffered to Gangs-ri lha-btsan if the ritualist is to win his favor. Thesecond text includes symbolic human anatomical and physiologicalofferings (para vi), potent gifts that are intended to bring homolo-gous health benefits, as well as spiritual progression in the tantricpath (para vi). In the bsGrags-byanghowever, the Bon-po argue thatthe use of human body parts and secretions is unsuitable for the cultof local deities, which reside in the pure abode (gtsang-ris kyi lha)(Karmay 1998: 392). Another peculiar tantric feature is the offeringof sexual congress to the deity (para vii). Other offerings of Indianorigin are the bkra-shis rdzas-brgyad(eight auspicious articles) and thergyal-srid sna-bdun(seven instruments of royal dominion). On the otherhand, a number of recorded offerings in the text can probably betraced to indigenous tradition, such as weapons, livestock and anensign.

However, therNying-ma Lha-btsan texts contain a higher proportion of archaicwords and imagery, and the tone of the verses are more along thelines of the bardic and Bon traditions, suggesting that they were thepredecessors of the ’Brug-pa text. In any event, the ’Brug-pa gsol-khawas not written before the first half of the 17th century, asdemonstrated by the inclusion of Ngag-dbang phyogs-las rnam-parrgyal-ba (1594–?1651), the unifier of the Bhutanese state.250The ’Brug-pa gsol-khais largely a sectarian affair, in which theBuddhist doctrine and the well-being of its monks and leaders areparamount. The Buddhist appropriation and taming of Gangs-ri lha-btsan described in the text represent the cultural ideal that many ofthe spirit-mediums aspire to, as does the general Buddhist popula-tion. The ’Brug-pa gsol-khabegins with an invitation to Gangs-ri lha-btsan and his circle of attendants (para i). They are asked not todiverge from the Buddhist oath that was given to them by augustfigures of the religion, and they are presented with the flesh andblood offerings of the wrathful protectors (para ii). The gtor-mainthe ritual are transformed into a metaphor for the fundamental char-acter of all phenomena, stong-pa nyid(emptiness) (para iii). In con-junction with the presentation of the gtor-ma, prostrations are madeto the Buddha, who has five different appellations in the text (paraiii).

Drums, conch shells and gshangare themost common instruments in these types of liturgies, precisely theinstruments most commonly used by the spirit-mediums.

The father of Nam-ra is a lha,and his mother a srin, spirits of the celestial realm and underworldrespectively. The primary names of Nam-ra’s five brothers and sis-ters indicate that these are also part of an archaic indigenous tra-dition, while their ‘secret names’ are Buddhist appellations (paras iii,iv). The use of such appellations is a common doctrinal stratagemfor maintaining indigenous deities within the fold of Buddhism. Thetext also notes the consort of Nam-ra, a deity named Glog-mo brag-dkar. Thelhaandsrinare clearly placed in the context of deitieswho once existed outside the auspices of Buddhism when the detailsof their oaths are given (para v). Among the oath-givers noted inthe text is the shepherd Shakya’ sengge who from his relative tem-poral position, must have lived sometime between 800 and 1100.’Jig-rten mgon-po deftly employs a large variety of trisyllabic indi-cators to describe Nam-ra’s palace, mounts, and circle of spirits (parasvi, vii, ix, xx, xxi). These serve to animate the descriptions with thevitality and poignancy that appear to have typified the ancient bardicutterances. These kinds of embellished verses have a bold directnessthat is probably not matched in the Sanskritic tradition of poetics.Nam-ra is attired as a heroic warrior (para viii). According to Bontradition, his stag-dong(tiger-skin quiver) and gzig-shub(leopard-skinbow case) in particular, are elements of the pre-Imperial warrior. Asis customary, Nam-ra’s retinue includes fierce carnivorous animals(para ix). This helps to explain why when such animals as wolves,wild dogs, lynx, and snow leopards cause damage to the ’brog-pa"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"herds it is often believed that the owners have somehow angeredthe mountain divinities. A variety of mountain deities in the circleof Nam-ra are invoked, most or all of which have names that reflecta native etymology (paras x–xii). Next, Nam-ra and his entourageare presented with the offerings of the ritual (para xiii). This is fol-lowed by exhortations to remember their Buddhist oaths (para xiv).Interestingly, the text tells us that Gu-ru rin-po-che magically madealha-g.yag dkar-po (divine white yak) the phyi-rten(outer support; anentity in which the deity resides) of Nam-ra (para xiv), a derivativeof antecedent tradition.The Obedient Great Black Onespecifies the presents that Nam-ra isoffered (para xv). They are of the type we are already familiar withfrom other texts. In the next paragraphs, Nam-ra has four dailymanifestations based on the ’phrin-lasplan (paras xvi–xix). Thesereflect the quality of light at various times in a 24–hour period.259Probably in order to strengthen the deity’s Buddhist credentials, theauthor relates that Nam-ra went repeatedly to India and is knownto roam around sandalwood forests (paras xx, xxii). Savage moun-tain deities, by their very nature, are the most tenuous members ofthe Buddhist pantheon and need constant reminding of their oathsand commitments. Yet, despite this inherent doctrinal uncertaintyregarding the loyalty of mountain deities, ’Jig-rten mgon-po was bothconfident and truthful enough to assert that Nam-ra is also a Bondeity in his aspect as a zhang-blon, an important group of ministersin the time of the Yar-lung kings (para xxiii).260It must be notedthat a Bon-po enclave is still found in Bar-tha. Following this dis-closure Nam-ra is reminded to uphold the three main Buddhist oathshe took (para xxiv).Nam-ra is referred to by the term jo-bo(big brother) on two occa-sions (paras xxii, xxiii). This implies that the mountain had a genealog-ical relationship with human beings. However, by the time this textwas composed in the 12th or 13th century, such native traditions(probably based on clan mythology) were already in a state of decline.To bring the ritual to completion there is the dngos-grub(consum-259For a discussion of this subject see Bellezza 1997, pp. 114, 115.260It is interesting to note that ’Jig-rten mgon-po may have been the first Buddhistphilosopher to systematically examine and reject Bon tenets (Khangsar Tulku: 1).Dan Martin, in personal communication, has pointed out that his followers accu-mulated the stories told in the anti-Bon polemic from around 1260.264part three"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"the mountain and lake deities of the spirit-mediums265mation) stage where the capability for the usual personal and worldlyboons is requested (para xxv).

The former is possibly theZhang-zhung word for tea, and the latter the common Tibetan word for tea. Yu-marmight also be related to the Tibetan word yongs-dmar,which means things thatare completely red like plain tea.326The expression kham-pa dngulis used here, kham-pabeing an adjective thatdescribes the color of silver (as well as a bay color in yaks).327There is some question as to the actual end of this text due to the graftingof a small gtor-maoffering onto it.

Your body is a very dark blue color and youride a fierce great otter (sram chen rngam-pa). Wielding an ax and ensignyou slay the enemy. You are the protector of the Bon doctrine andsgra-blaof the gshen. By virtue of your outer nature (phyi-ltar) you areknown as the elder brother doctrine protector (bka’ srung) in all thecountries of the north (byang-phyogs yul). You have a bright red body,one head and two arms. Holding aloft a dbalbanner in the right handyou rain down the good fortune of wealth. By shooting arrows withthe left [hand] you slay the enemies. Riding the red horse with a whiteface of the btsan(btsan rta dmar zhur) you circle the four worlds. Youactually reveal your face [to your votaries], and are the custodian ofwealth (dkor-bdag) for the dynasty of kings. In front of the great, excel-lent dBal-gsas rngam-pa you offered the life-force of your heart. Donot break your oath. Do not be malevolent. Carry out the activitieswe have entrusted to you.According to Bon conceptions, Mi-bdud is not a mountain god buta more important type of protector deity. He is the central figureof a tradition known as bDud-bon with its own distinctive liturgiesand vocabulary. bDud-bon is believed to be a particularly ancienttradition predating even the prehistoric founder of Bon, gShen-rabmi-bo-che. Mi-bdud, like most other bdud, is entirely black in color.As we have seen, the invocatory text to Nam-ra authored by ’Jig-rten mgon-po is entitled The Obedient Great Black One, yet it says noth-ing about this appellation. Nevertheless, given the Bon tradition, itseems entirely possible that this text was named with Mi-bdud inmind; in reference to a pre-existing body of lore. After all, The ObedientGreat Black Onedoes clearly assert that Nam-ra is a Bon deity asso-ciated with the ancient zhang-blontradition, as well as being a Buddhistgod.328SeeLha btsan nam ra’i gsol kha bsam don myur ’grub ces bya ba ’dod dgu dgyes pa’imchod sprin,folio 4b, lns. 1–5.

It wasdestroyed in the Chinese Cultural Revolution but Shel-btsun nyi-ma rgyal-mtshanwas able to recite it. It was transcribed by g.Yung-drung bstan-pa’i rgyal-mtshan.I obtained this text in the Bon enclave of Na-dmar chung, Nag-chu.

The first of these is Lha btsan nam ra’ibsang mchod(about two folios in length; folios 6a to 7a of the collection), whoseauthor is referred to as dBra-ston shes-rab dgongs-rgyal. The text begins; “In thecountry, the northern upper country, are Nam-ra lha-btsan, Lha-gcam (= lcam)glog-mo and others.” This work in general terms continues to mention Nam-ra’smanifestations and entourage. The second text is identically titled Lha btsan nam ra’ibsang mchod (1 folio; folio 7a and 7b of the collection). The author in this text iscalled Shil (= Shel) bla bsod-nams rgyal-mtshan. It records the consort of Nam-raas follows (folio 7a): “We present Lha-btsan nam-ra and your circle with offeringsof incense and phud(first offerings of food and drink). We present the great motherLha-gcam (= lcam) glog-mo with offerings of incense and phud.”329This text is included in Dra ba dmar nag gi rgyud, nos. 381–404, Tibetan BonpoMonastic Centre, Dolanji: 1972. The colophon reads: “Hris-pa gyer-med transmit-ted it to [the first of ] the twelve sku-gshen(royal priests), [the last of which] trans-mitted it to lDa-zu bon-po.

It is located twenty kilometers south of Nam-ra."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"The same text provides an informative account of the origins of Mi-bdud and his struggle against the Hor of pre-Imperial times (nos.386, ln. 8 to 388, ln. 9). The ethnonym Hor, as applied in Tibetanliterature, is a fluid ascription defined by historical context. It oftenrefers to the various Turco-Mongolian groups inhabiting regionsnorth of Tibet, but it can also be used to designate Bodic peoplesof northeastern Tibet, the Sogdians (Sog-po) of Imperial times, andpossibly earlier Indo-European cultures as well.332The Bon text g.Yungdrung bon gyi rgyud bumchronicles the conquering of a Hor kingdomin the time of Tibet’s 25th king Phri-thob nam-brtsan (Bellezza 2001:65, 66), while the Drang don mun selprovides an account of a pre-Imperial invasion of Pu-rang by the Central Asian Gar-log sog-po(Bellezza 2002a: 23, 24). A kinship between Tibet and Central Asiais asserted in the Bon ritual text Mu ye pra phud phya’i mthur thug (folio16, lns. 3, 4), where it states that the prince of existence ’Thing-geproduced both the fully endowed Tibetans and [inhabitants of ]Phrom (probably a region in Eastern Turkestan) with his wife Phywa-lcam dkar-mo.The theme of Hor invaders in early times is also found through-out Upper Tibet in the oral tradition. In Ru-thog, there is a legendthat speaks of an invasion of the region by a Hor group from EasternTurkestan, who are often likened to Hor gur-dkar rgyal-po andbShan-pa sme-ru-rtse of the Ge-sar epic. During their tenure, theyare said to have occupied Ru-thog’s six most important pastures(Hor gser-po na-dmar), which include: 1) Ma mkha’ gzhung (Ru-thog rdzong), 2) Gru-gu gzhung (lCags-sgang), 3) gTsang-dkar gzhung(rDo-dmar), 4) gZhung-pa-che (Re-co), 5) O gzhung (O-byang), and6)¤o gzhung (O-byang). The Hor of the pre-Imperial period arealso supposed to have occupied southern Ngam-ring where they wor-shipped three lha-ri.According to local accounts, the mountain ofbKra-bzang was occupied by the deity Hor gyi dpal-bzang bshan-pa, and subsequently oath-bound by Gu-ru rin-po-che and renamedChos-bdag bam-chung brag-btsan (a form of A-bse rgyal-po).

Similarly, the ruins of ancientcastles and fortifications at Dang-ra g.yu-mtsho are attributed in theoral tradition to the Sog-po (a Turco-Mongolian or Indo-Europeangroup) of ancient times (Tenzin Namdak 1997: 16; Bellezza 2001:143, 144).Dra ba nag po lda zor declares that Mi-bdud’s father was born froman egg, which arose from the cosmogonic dew (para i). From hisbloody birth, Mi-bdud appeared with an ax (sta-mo), ladle (sgyogs),sickle (zor-ba), and catapult (skyogs), important implements of theTibetans since time immemorial (para ii). The description of Mi-bdud’s attributes and accompanying animals bestow him with themantle of a hunter and gatherer. The mythic historical place of thebdudis recorded in a cosmogony found in the 13th century mKhaspa lde’u.It records that there was a succession of nine different typesof non-humans who ruled Tibet before people.

Also, apparitions of Hor and Mon armieswere entertained. After Mi-bdud and Hur-pa agreed to help sNa-ro defeat theenemy, they prescribed a ritual performance for invoking the deities in which amandala was painted with the blood of a wild carnivore and the blood of some-one who had died a violent death (gri-khrag). Various articles were placed on themandala and many mantras were recited. This led to deity-inspired visions of thun-der, hail, many yaks, sheep, and soldiers in armor, as well as a hawk and wolf.Afterwards, a ritual for slaughtering the enemy was carried out in which alingga(effigy) with the name of the Hor-pa, Gyim-shang was placed inside a tha-ram(tri-angular enclosure). The execution occurred when his bla(soul) appeared as sevenbay-colored yaks inside the tha-ram. Finally, twelve gshen-po(Bon priests) officiatingat the ritual uprooted the lineage of Gyim-shang by placing a wolf skull inside thetha-ram, while reciting spells, and making meat and blood offerings to the lha-srinsde-brgyad.335These three opening lines introduce the deity but their precise meaning isunclear.

Unfortunately, this text doesnot have a colophon and no author is attributed to it. From the lit-erary style, the nature of its contents and the authoritative tone ofthe language employed, this would seem to be a centuries old gsol-khatext written by a great Buddhist master. Instead of applying skya/rkya349in the appellation of the deity the word skyabs(protector) is usedinstead, one of a number of Buddhacizing elements in this work.349Scholars opine that this word might be the Zhang-zhung lexical term for btsanorrje(lord).

The offeringsensemble to the deity is conceived in the form of a castle, anotherconvention used in the propitiation of protective deities (para iii). Asin other gsol-kha texts, these offerings are given to forge a close rela-tionship or afflatus with the deities (paras iii–vi). The deities in theguise of fierce warriors are then vividly described (para vii). TheRol-pa skya-bdun are accorded the role of protector of King Khri-srong lde’u-btsan’s (755–797) lineage (para viii), as they are in thetextGung thang gdung rabswhere they are referred to as personal pro-tectors (’go-ba’i sku-lha) of the King (Diemberger 1998: 47). The gsol-khatext carefully elaborates upon the oath the Rol-pa gods took withGu-ru rin-po-che and what kinds of activities this entails (paras viii, x). These are interspersed with panegyrics (bstod-pa) that extolthe terrific appearance and power of the deities. As with other deitiesinhabiting mountains, the Rol-pa skya-bdun are referred to as dgra-lha(paras x, xii).The next section of the text is the wrathful signaling component(drag-bskul), which consists of forceful, vibrant descriptions of the deity’smountain residence and his various names and attributes (parasxi–xiii). By the composition of eloquent verses it is hoped that theRol-pa skya-bdun will respond to the ritualists’ petitions and carryout their requests. The description of their abode is rendered in theancient bardic style, with the productive use of trisyllabic indicatorsat the end of each verse (paras vii, xi). These inspirit otherwise pedes-trian verses. As is typical of the gsol-khagenre, the Rol-pa skya-bdunappear in the form of truculent native warriors.

Nevertheless, the ancient structural compo-nents of the gser-skyemsare still present: the offering of gtor-maandlibations, a litany of the deity’s circle, and requests for aid of a prac-tical nature.The text begins with instructions on how to arrange the offeringsneeded in the ritual. They are of the usual type and include gtor-ma, grain, beverages, and small replicas of livestock (para i). Thelibations become a metaphor for the realized wisdom of the ritual-ists, and they are first offered to the lamas and tantric systems ofthe Karma bka’ brgyud (para ii). The libation offering to the Rol-pa skya-bdun is amalgamated to one for higher protectors with anacknowledgment of the oath that Gu-ru rin-po-che gave the btsan(para iii). This is followed by offerings made to the deities in Rol-pa’s circle, located throughout sGer-rtse and adjoining regions (paraiv). Reference is made to the mate of Rol-pa, the lake sTong-mtsho,located 40 kilometers east of the mountain. This is representative ofthe ancient mythology of Upper Tibet with its mountain-lake dyads,as still propounded by the spirit-mediums of the region. The finalportion of Libations for the Wild bTsan Rol-pa skya-bdun for the MiraculousRealization of the Objects of Desire deals with the requests made to thedeity (para v).

According to localsources, his main residences are two mountains in Gar-sde, south-west of gNam-mtsho: Dam-can A-jo, a large snow mountain in theTrans-Himalaya, straddling the dPal-mgon and sNye-mo county line;and Dam-can mgar-nag, a mountain of black talus (rdza-ri) in closeproximity. These two mountains, located in the Yar-gling area ofsGar-sde, host the deity’s celestial castle called Pha-wang long-pa’isku-mkhar (sp.?). The most important shrine for Dam-can mgar-banag-po is found in the valley of Me rdo-lung, in Bar-gling, the mid-dle portion of sGar-sde. This shrine (rten) consists of a round blackiron-ore boulder approximately two spans across. According to localfolklore, this stone is the anvil of Dam-can. He is said to havedropped it at its present location while being chased by gNyan-chenthang-lha, after he had an illicit affair with gNam-mtsho. Anotherlocal myth says that Dam-can was appointed the chief blacksmithof the epic hero Ge-sar because he was so skillful that he could man-ufacture a thousand rdo-rjein a single night. Due to this feat, at his"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"the mountain and lake deities of the spirit-mediums303appointment, he was conferred the name rDo-rje legs-pa (AdamantineGoodness).As we have seen, Dam-can is often considered synonymous withthe famous protective deity rDo-rje legs-pa.402Indeed, in a rDo-rjelegs-pa text handed down to the lha-paPho-bo lha-dbang from hisfather, one of the many names of this deity is mGar-ba nag-po. Thistext, entitled A Summary of the Activities Entrusted to the Salubrious AdamantineHoly Man Oath-Holder, was written by Klong-chen-pa rab ’byamsbzang-po (1308–1363).403It is designed to be used in conjunctionwith an offering text. The articles presented to rDo-rje legs-pa areof the kinds with which we are already familiar. Klong-chen’s textalso contains a comprehensive resume of the kinds of activities thatthe ritualist expects of the deity. These faithfully reproduce the func-tions of the deity in the tradition of spirit-mediumship.A Summary of the Activities Entrusted to the Salubrious Adamantine HolyMan Oath-Holder begins with the Buddhist appellations of rDo-rje legs-pa, the protector of the world and owner of treasures (para i). Thisis followed by a general description of the awe-invoking appearanceof the deity (para ii). Hispho-nya(attendants) are wolves and bears,the kinds of animals that figure prominently in the pantheon of reme-dial spirits of the spirit-mediums. The text states that one of thenames of rDo-rje legs-pa is mGar-ba nag-po and that, like the moun-tain deities, he is a dgra-lha(para iii). It also states, in an ecumeni-cal spirit, that he is the protector of both the Bon-po and Buddhists,as well as the leader of many professions (para iii). Of special inter-est is the list of boons expected of the deity after he has beenpresented with his offerings (paras iv, v). These extend to the health-oriented, social, and military spheres of life, and are apotropaic andfortune-bestowing in nature:402Or his primary emanation. A review of rDo-rje legs-pa is found in Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956, pp. 154–159.403The colophon reads: “This is Dam can skyes bu chen po rdo rje legs pa phrin bcolbsdus pa, the omniscient speech dominator of Klong-chen-pa rab ’byams bzang-po,which are blessed words.

As with the lha-pa, the horrific power of Dam-can can only be unleashed when absolutely necessary, and the rit-ualists must seek the sanction of the higher deities for its application(para i).

These threefemale deities constitute the most important mo-lhaof Upper Tibet. Women gen-erally worship them with offerings of milk and yogurt. Placation of the mo-lhaisalso believed to help prevent diseases caused by the klu. At auspicious times for theworship of the klu, such as klu-thebs(when the kluare believed to emerge near thesurface of the earth), lamas were traditionally called to perform klu-bumandklu-gtoroffering rituals, which are thought to benefit the mo-lha.

She is the ruler of four powerful male protectors, her spir-itual sons, each with its own mountain residence: 1) east—Lha-rgodsnying-phrom (bSam-gtan gangs-bzang); 2) south—Klu-bdud thang-lha (gNyan-chen thang-lha); 3) north—Mi-bdud ’byams-pa khrag-mgo (Nam-ra); and 4) west—bTsan-rgod hur-pa gsod-rkyen(Khong-khyim zhal-dkar). Each of these deities, in their sundry guises,has an apotropaic function exercised through the control of the var-ious orders of elemental spirits, just as they do in the oral traditionof the spirit-mediums. In the Yum tradition, gNam-mtsho takes prece-dence over the male pantheon, as attested by certain spirit-mediumsand other aspects of oral tradition. As Yum is thought to be a pre-Imperial goddess, ancient gynarchic cultural elements may possiblybe reflected in the gender power equation presented in her textualtradition.The most detailed descriptions of Yum and her coterie of maleprotectors is found in a ritual text entitled Combined Performances of theFive, Mother, Sons, Masters of Treasures.434It is designed for the exorcis-tic function of destroying the enemies of Bon. The text begins withthe signaling of Yum and her sons who are urged to adhere to theiroath (para i).435As is customary in literature for the yul-lha, the ru-dar(ensign or regimental banner) is used as a sign of martial vic-tory (para i). Yum’s native home is poetically depicted as a completerealm with both a snow mountain and a turquoise lake (para ii).Like other native deities, she is described as possessing a dualisticpersonality, empowering her to be both mistress of disease and theguardian of the life-force (para iii). It will be recalled that the spirit-mediums that work with gNam-mtsho and her circle attribute dis-ease to them as well as being the agents of sound health.Thefirst of Yum’s sons to be detailed is Lha-rgod snying-phrom,who like the spirit-mediums, is portrayed playing the drum and gshang434gTer bdag yum sras lnga yi dril bsgrub(nos. 617–630) is found in the dBal gsasrngam pa’i sngags sgrub ’phrin lassection (nos. 543–676) of a volume entitled Phyi nanggsang gsum gyi nyer mkho ’dod ’jo ’khri shing.The colophon reads: “Treasure hid at thesecret rock on the neck (flanks) of the south mountain.” (lho ri’i mgul nas(=na)gsangba’i brag la gter du sbas /). This line is followed by a brief account of how Bondeclined in the period of King Khri-srong lde’u-btsan (755–797) necessitating thehiding of texts. The concluding line, states, “The treasures of Khod-spungs [dran-pa nam-mkha’] were hidden all over.” (Khod spungs gter kun la khyad par sbas /). Thislast line seems to indicate that the text was authored by Dran-pa nam-mkha’ (Eighthcentury).435This translation does not treat the first portion of the text (nos. 617 to 620,ln. 5).

This is reflective of the spirit-mediums’ philosophy of infelicity, which holds that a major cause ofdisease and misfortune is the loss or degradation of one’s personalprotective deities (such as the pho-lha, phugs-lhaandtshe-lha). In hismorning emanation, Klu-bdud thang-lha has the appearance of atypicallha-ri, a white deity with a white robe and helmet (para v).The deities Mi-bdud ’byams-pa khrag-mgo and his assistant bTsan-rgod hur-pa are described in characteristic fashion as bloodthirsty,pitiless foes of the enemies of Bon (paras vi, vii).

practitioners, which is found in theBon commentaries.456Like many other gsol-kha, this work maintainslines of seven syllables throughout. This text is very important becauseit clearly summarizes the kinds of activities that violate the sanctityof the environment-bound pantheon. An examination of the activi-ties that anger these deities provides a traditional résumé of the eti-ology of disease as endorsed by the spirit-mediums. The text is alsosignificant because it furnishes a literary basis for the cosmogonicqualities of female lakes, which is mostly the provenance of the UpperTibetan oral tradition.457After the preliminary refuge-taking and visualizations, the text pre-sents a ritual proclamation in the form of an origin myth (smrang)(paras i, ii). The media from which the indigenous deities arise arewind, light and a series of lakes. In one sequence, the cosmogonicelements are a female lake and the wind, which give birth to a gen-erative egg. This recalls the cosmological procreative function of the456New Collection of Bon bka’ brten, vol. 87, nos. 897–902. The colophon reads:“Offer these words in this way to the yul-safor the reconciliation of their enmity.This pacifier of the yul-sawas written by the mKhas-pa mi-bzhi*. When the Bondoctrine declined Li-shu stag-ring hid it at the peak of rMa-rgyal pom-ri.

In the Buddhist textRlang kyi po ti bse ru rgyas, written by Ta’i si-tu (1302–1371), thismythic motif is expressed as follows (Norbu 1996: 18, 579): “Fromthe essence of the five elements appeared a large egg. The shell ofthe egg became a divine white rock formation. The liquid inside theegg was a swirling conch lake. The middle of the egg became thesix realms of sentient beings.”The cosmogonic egg is a mythic theme with wide distribution inthe Tibetan cultural world, and it is assigned by Bon tradition toearly times. In a commentary on the famous Bon cosmological workentitledSrid pa’i mdzod phugs, which is attributed to Dran-pa nam-mkha’ (Eighth century), the generative power of the cosmic egg isdescribed.459This account notes that from the essence of the fiveelements two eggs were formed. The egg from the virtuous side ofexistence was octagonal and as large as a yak. This white egg wasbroken by a wheel of light, and from it appeared Srid-pa sangs-po’bum-khri, a conch [white] man with turquoise hair, the king of yod-khams(existence). Likewise, in an ancient (?) myth recorded in theTi se’i dkar chagof dKar-ru Grub-dbang (born 1801) generative eggsare responsible for the birth of the four sacred Bon lakes in south-western Tibet, (nos. 507–510). This account states, “In the begin-ning there was vacuous emptiness. From the causal principle ofself-manifesting existence four radiant eggs descended from the empti-ness of space.”460They are listed as:458The Na-khi, a people who have retained significant ancient Bon customs andtraditions, have a body of similar myths. In one of their manuscripts, it states thatthe father of the Na-khi race, Mùa»-llü ddu-ndz ̆ı, came forth from a silver whitemountain and his wife Ts’u-chwua gyi-mu»was born from a turquoise blue lake(Rock 1952: 134). Yü-p’ü ch^r-sso ä-dz ̆ı, the grandmother of thirteen Na-khi war-rior spirits (similar to the Tibetan thugs-dkarandwer-ma), was born from a turquoiseblue lake, while their grandfather Yü-p’ü ch^r-sso ä-p’u, was born from a white asconch mountain (Rock 1972: 105, 106; 1952: 134). In a Na-khi funerary manu-script it relates that Shi-lo’s (gShen-rab) father was the heaven and his mother theearth (Rock 1972: 460). Khü-zä, the first human being, came into being from agolden yellow lake that appeared from a dew drop, which fell from an egg laid byheaven and earth (Rock 1963a: 191). Some of the llü-mu»(klu) were also born fromeggs (Rock 1972: 124–170).459SeeSrid pa’i mdzod phugs kyi rtsa ’grel, nos. 52–54.

Bon texts for thegoddess Yum-sras of gNam-mtsho (ascribed to the same period asthis work) also assign the role of sons to the male mountain gods.As noted, some of the spirit-mediums likewise affirm that the femalelake deities are foremost. Paleocultural matriarchal social structuresmay possibly be implicit in this gender relationship (cf. Bellezza 1997:115). In the same Srid pa’i mdzod phugsreference noted above, theprogenetrix of all living beings originated from an ocean (rgya-mtsho).It explains that from the five elements appeared dew and raindrops,which formed the ocean. The ocean was churned by a wind and abubble as large as a tent was formed. From it appeared a resplen-dent blue egg that opened on its own. From this appeared a turquoiseblue woman, Chu-lcam rgyal-mo, the queen of existence.In the theogonic sequence of the gsol-khatext mention is made ofan archaic grouping of deities known as Lha-gar-rten gsum whospring up from light (para i). This group includes thelhaof the threecosmological realms, the garprotectors from enemies, and the rten,the nine personal and household gods.462462The Lha-gar-rten gsum/Lha-dkar-rten gsum has some correspondence withthe gNam-lha dkar-gsum,a group that resides high in the firmament, which arefound in a theogonic sequence that gave rise to Tibet’s first king, gNya’ khri btsan-po.

These ancient prohibitions, allied with the Buddhistethic of non-violence, have prevailed in Tibet until recent times. Theconsequences that are believed to come from the violation of theecological sanctions and the desire to avoid recriminations help toexplain the continued demand for religious practitioners such as thelha-pa.These specialists work to restore the balance between society,the environment, and the deities immanent in them.

The various classes of deities are invitedto the different types of offering articles (para iii). They are depictedas circling these objects—not unlike the manner in which the radi-ant consciousness of the gods of the trance circles the ritual objectsof the spirit-mediums.480The full array of characteristic offerings aremade to the indigenous pantheon in order that they might reside inthegsas-mkharand serve the desires of the ritualists (paras iv, v).

For example, in thevillage of Te (in Nepal), three territorial deities are arranged in this fashion in agser-skyems, which is used to prevent human and livestock illnesses and insure a goodharvest.

Written circa the Ninthcentury, this text provides us with historical confirmation of the antiq-uity of some of the spirit-mediums’ practices and of those recordedin related ritual texts. Among the most prominent of these is theuse of an arrow festooned with cloth and a vulture feather as anoffering article (para i). As we have seen, such arrows form one ofthelha-pa’s most important presentation and healing instruments.Other offerings recorded in Pelliot 126 include meat, beer anddairy products, the very kinds of things still commonly presented tothe indigenous pantheon (para ii) by the spirit-mediums and othertypes of religious specialists.

The use of blue grain(barley) beer (sngon-mo ’ding-ding ’bras) in Pelliot 126is echoed in themKhas pa lde’u(pp. 236, 237), where it notes that when the KingNya’ khri btsan-po was to assume the rule of Tibet, “He gave updivine libations (lha-skyems byang-khu) and drank the blue grain beer(dang-ding ’bras-chang sngon-mo), the blue libations of men. He thenproceeded to Gyi ’thing, in the land of humans (a place in front ofBon-ri in rKong-po).”Another direct link between the ritual system described in theapproximately 1100 year-old Pelliot 126and present day practices isthe use of specially marked high quality livestock as offerings to themountain divinities and other indigenous deities.

The activities and teaching of this great legendarypersonality are recorded in various biographical sources. The longestof these is called mDo dri med gzi brjid, and in published form it runsto some twelve volumes.1This biography of the founder of Bon issaid to have been composed in the distant past by sTang-chen dmu-tsha gyer-med and transmitted through a vision to sPrul-sku blo-ldansnying-po (born 1360), who committed it to writing. It contains alarge body of biographical, hagiographic and doctrinal material, aswell as Bon mythological and historical references derived from diversesources.ThegZi brjiddetails the nine branches or vehicles of the Bon reli-gious teachings, as first propounded by gShen-rab in a celestial king-dom to a group of divine beings.2Thefirst of these vehicles (theg-pa)is called Phya-gshen, which describes the Bon systems of astrology,healing rites, therapies, and divination.3These are delineated in acommon part (spyi yi sde) and a special part (sgos kyi bye brag). Thesystem of divination is subdivided into four separate branches (sgossu rnam bzhi), relating to divination by knots, divination by otherinstruments, divination by dreams, and the commands of deities (lhayi bka’ bab). This latter subdivision is a kind of oracular utterance,and it is from this type of divination that the tradition of spirit-medi-umship is attributed. As such, the Bon tradition clearly upholds the"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"spirit-mediums in the bon literary tradition3454See vol. 2, pp. 384, ln. 7 to 387, ln. 12, of the gZi brjidpublished by Bod-ljongs bod-yig dpe-rnying dpe-skrun khang, Lhasa: 2000.

While this claim in itselfcannot be taken as a serious historical argument, it is indicative ofthe length of time encompassed by the legendary associations thatare connected to the tradition of summoning deities into one’s person.The excerpt of the gZi brjidtranslated below pertains to the impor-tance of the Phya-gshen teachings, and the way in which they areenumerated and classified. It is in this context that the role of theoracular tradition in the Bon religion is framed. Most importantly,thegZi brjidexplicitly states that divination and the other systemsenumerated in Phya-gshen are to be practiced with honesty andintegrity on behalf of all living beings. The ethic of practice set forthhere is one that is still embodied by the lha-paof Upper Tibet. Myassociation with the spirit-mediums indicates that this altruism helpsto define the current tradition, and distinguishes it from other formsof spirit-mediumship, where self-aggrandizement or political calcula-tion play a prominent part. While it may be argued by the skepti-cal that Bon and Buddhist teachings in Tibet have always appearedas a commodity to be merely bought and sold, my experiences withthe spirit-mediums of our times establishes that there is far more totheir motivations than mercenary intent. To the contrary, my findingsdemonstrate that in terms of motivation and commitment, the lha-paof Upper Tibet are to be lauded—for they embody the ideals ofBon (as well as Buddhist) practice.In thisgZi brjidexcerpt the grandeur and solemnity of the reve-lation of the Bon doctrines by sTon-pa gShen-rab are amply con-veyed.4It begins with the assembling of a divine convocation andthe revelation of the profundity of the teachings (paras i, ii). gShen-rab discloses the telos, which is the infinitely compassionate mind(para ii). Derived from this fundamental reality, the Phya-gshen vehi-cle is presented as an instrument for alleviating suffering (para iii).The elaborate classification system of the Phya-gshen teachings isthen presented to the audience (paras iv–vii):"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"346part four (i) At that time, when Prince sTon-pa gshen-rab was one year old,5he stayed together with rMa-lo and g.Yu-lo6at the Bar-po so-brgyadcastle.

As a part of this gShen-rab briefly describes how thedivination rites are to be performed.24The altar he prescribes with24The antiquity of the Phya-gshen rituals is attested in the Tun-huang manu-scripts. In one passage the practice of divination (mo-btab), beneficial rites (gto),ther-apies (dpyad), as well as phya(prognosis, vital force) are mentioned. See Karmay1998, p. 247; Stein 2003, p. 596. In the Tun-huang manuscript IOL 734(only thetransliterated text was available to me) we read: “The one hundred white-headedfathergshenwere assembled. They conducted divination (mo-btab) and made* prog-noses (phya).” (po gshen thod kar brgya bsogs te / mo bthab phya bla’gste/).* The precise import of bla’gsteis not clear.InPelliot 1289(Choix de Documents Tibétains Conservés à la Bibliothèque Nationale Complétépar Quelques Manuscrits de L’ India Office et du British Museum, vol.

You have salutary (’ches)sman, yul-sa, lha, and dgra-bla, so offerto them.

In his unpublished commentary on the Phya-gshen vehiclehe writes that the class of deities known assrid-pa’i sgra-bla(sgra-blaof existence) appears to have been used in ancient times by the spirit-mediums.36This tradition gradually fell into obscurity and was replacedby a degenerate tradition in which demonic entities possessed spirit-mediums:37It appears that the fourth part38concerns the various sgra-blaof exis-tence.

Reliance on these [decadent] tra-ditions was greatly propagated in Tibet especially by the Tibetan gov-ernment, which had supreme confidence in such traditions [to discerninnermost thoughts and sentiments]. However, the ancient tradition isauthentic, and we cannot say that the support of the bsen-mo41insidethe body at present is the same. The source of the authentic traditionis no longer clearly discernible [in the contemporary tradition].The adoption of what appears to have been a degenerate traditionof spirit-mediumship, and its impact on Tibetan culture and societyin the pre-Communist period, is beyond the scope of this study.However, it must be said that it appears to have had a strong socialeffect, contributing to strained sectarian relations and the deprecia-tion of the native divinities. The lha-paof Upper Tibet were notgenerally held in high esteem by the lamaist religious establishmentof Tibet, due to their reliance on lower ‘worldly’ deities and theirmodest socioeconomic status. As we have seen, however, their prac-tice does in fact, emulate the Bon ideal of selfless-service on whichthe Phya-gshen traditions are based. It should also be noted that theinstitution of oracles in Lhasa was, with its aristocratic patronage,prone to satisfying the whims of the rich and powerful. In contrast,in the harsh environmental and economic conditions of Upper Tibet,the spirit-mediums of today are impelled to remain truer to the altru-istic ideal of the Phya-gshen, and provide for the vital needs of theircommunity. Also, the question of legitimacy and antiquity favors thelha-paof Upper Tibet over those mediums who were possessed byghosts of the murdered and deities of foreign pedigree. There aremany correspondences between the lha-pa’s autochthonous mountaingods and the sgra-blaof primordial existence on which the ancienttradition of spirit-mediumship is alleged to have depended.

Phu-wer appears to be the Zhang-zhung equiva-lent of ’Gegs-rgyal (Obstruction Conqueror). By its inclusion in gShen-rab’s biography this deity enjoys very ancient legendary origins.Phu-wer dkar-po is closely related to the sgra-blaclass of deities, buthas an irenic, not martial character. A Bon divination text for Phu-wer survives in the Mi-pham gsung ’bumof the rNying-ma scholar Jam-mgon ’ju mi-pham rgya-mtsho (1846–1912).42This text is attributedto Dran-pa nam-mkha’, one of at least two personalities, who livedno later then the Eighth century.43While it is not at all clear if Phu-wer was ever a deity that pos-sessed spirit-mediums, his participation in a ritual to divine the futurefinds resonance in rituals that are part of the modern trance cere-mony of indigenous deities. In both the ancient and modern vari-ants of the divination ritual, use of the mda’ darandme-longare made.42One of the most eminent figures in the non-sectarian movement. For back-ground information see Smith 2001, pp. 230–233.43The colophon of this text reads: “The performance of the Phu-wer of speech*is easy to do and the consummation quick. I Bla-chen [dran-pa nam-mkha’], onbehalf of future beings [authored] this essence of the method of performance of thePhu-wer sisters and brothers as a pithy explication of divination and omens [ritu-als]. It was given to Lha-btsan rgyal-po (a mountain deity) of mDo-gam (easternTibet). This text looks like a wish-fulfilling jewel.

Furthermore, pacific (white) forms of mountain deities,whose appearance is not unlike Phu-wer, are responsible for div-ination in the trance ceremonies of the lha-pa.The Phu-wer divination ritual is based upon the use of a me-longin which pra(signs and visions) appear. In the preliminary practices,which include offerings to the same classes of deities propitiated bythelha-pa(para i), the help of the environment-bound spirits isenlisted. This is accomplished so that these spirit owners of the localehelp, rather than impede, the ritual.The main practices of the ritual include the construction of a man-dala and a special type of arrow to be used as a support for thedeity (paras ii–iv). This is followed by an ensemble of offerings, whichincludes yaks, sheep, goats, wild ungulates and birds (para. v). Theseanimal gifts (real and simulated) are characteristic of the Phya-gshen,Buddhist and contemporary lha-patraditions relating to indigenousdeities in Upper Tibet. As noted, the ritual gifting of special ani-mals is a cultural phenomenon of much historical continuity, explain-ing its existence in diverse religious traditions. Interestingly, the useofsbrang-chang(mead) and rgun-chang(grape wine) as offerings for Phu-wer seems to point to early cultural influences coming from CentralAsia or the West.44It is also curious that despite being a pacificdeity, Phu-wer is the recipient of meat and alcohol, just like theambivalent deities of the environment-bound pantheon.The Phu-wer ritual stresses the importance of purity (para v), atheme of great significance for the lha-paas well. The male formsof Phu-wer are not alone, for their three sisters and circle of eightsmanalsofind mention in the text (paras vi and ix). Deities of bothgenders, particularly in dyadic arrangements, are a hallmark of thelha-pa’s pantheon of presiding and possessing deities. As we haveseen, male and female deities often work in concert for the spirit-mediums, as they do in this ritual. The praises (bstod-pa) componentof the text (paras viii–x) was composed in the traditional mannerwith lines of seven syllables, endowing it with the charcteristic cadenceof the hymns to the indigenous gods:44It is has even been theorized that Phu-wer represents a Greco-Roman deity(Norbu 1998: 2)."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"spirit-mediums in the bon literary tradition357(i) The performance of the Phu-wer god of fortune.

So different in character are the rituals and the activities of Phu-wer that it is questionable if the same deity is really intended in therespective Phya-gshen and tantric performances, despite the god hav-ing the same namesake.

This story is followed by a description ofYe-shes snying-po. The ritual performance itself is divided into thefollowing major sections:64Biographical lore about this mythical Bon practitioner is found in Karmay1972, pp. xxii, xxiii.65See New Collection of Bon bka’ brten, vol. 229, nos. 378–394.

By medi-tating on the awe-inspiring form of the eighteen-headed dBal-gsasrngam-pa, he acquires the power to subjugate these malicious beings(paras iii, iv).

In his hand he held a snake lassonine spans in length.

The sound of his laughter was rageful.(iv) [Ye-shes snying-po] visualized [dBal-gsas] like that. Then he utteredan incantation.69He recited 108 incantations and blew them onto acrystal egg. He threw it upon the ocean. Three times the ocean roseinto the sky and three times it dried up. Thereafter, from inside theocean, appeared a white crystal tent with one entrance. At the entrancethere were four beautiful women. In unison the four beautiful womenpraised him. They praised him [saying], “You have a pacific mind,wrathful manner and fearful appearance.

Nevertheless, the tantricelements found in the text suggest that it is an example of the syn-cretistic melding of Indian and indigenous tradition. Written in prose,it contains an unusual collection of ritual practices, which lucidlyand comprehensively address many of the maladies and problemsfacing human beings. The activities covered in the work includethose for bringing and stopping rain (paras ii–vi), prevention of hail(para vii), protection from lightning (para viii), fertility and the wellbeing of children (para ix), treatment of leprosy (paras x, xi), block-age of disease based on Bon tutelary deities and associated khyung(paras xii, xiii), elimination of nightmares (para xiv), and the sup-pression of diseases using effigies (para xv). As we have seen, thesetypes of curative and rehabilitative functions are the object of thespirit-mediums’ trance ceremonies (with the addition of divination)as well. However, instead of deity embodiment, the officiants in thisPhu-wer ritual depend on mantras and meditation directed towardsthe tutelary gods.In the text, Phu-wer is synonymous with dBal-gsas rngam-pa. Twoother Bon tutelary deities are also incorporated in the performance:Lha-rgod of the speech and gTso-mchog of the mind.71As such,Phu-wer has no independent identity in the ritual nor is there ref-erence to his Phya-gshen origin. In my opinion, the effacement ofthe Phu-wer lord of divination and his amalgamation to tantric tra-dition seems to represent a later Indian-inspired cultural innovation.The ritual practices of the text are mainly based on the recitationof mantras and spells, visualization of the tutelary deities and asso-ciatedkhyungdeities, the administering of medicine, the use of figurinesand effigies, and the wielding of the phur-bu(dagger).

Notably, the khyungis animportant curative deity for the lha-paof Upper Tibet. Like somespirit-mediums, the text prescribes the pouring of milk into springsto make rain fall (paras iii, iv), one of many techniques listed formanipulating the weather. Hail can be a very destructive force inTibet and its prevention is one of the objects of the text as it is intrance ceremonies.The fostering of fertility and child survival is another preoccupa-tion the text has in common with the priorities of the spirit-medi-ums (para ix).

Here is shown the ritual performance text [of White Phu-wer].Firstly, on the occasion of the ritual performance there is: 1) dbab-pa(precipitation), 2) bcad-pa(stoppage), 3) zlog-pa(expulsion), 4) srung-ba(protection), and 5) gso-ba(restoration). So, first is letting rain fall down.Stoppage is the halting of hail. Expulsion is the expelling of bad signsand omens. Protection is protecting the countryside. Restoration is thehealing of diseases.(ii) Firstly for letting rain fall: You yourselves continually intone themantra of the yi-damdeity at a pure place. Then the method of let-ting rain fall is generally for any sorcery of the klu. The khyung[dom-inate] the four orders of kluand let rain fall. The incantations of theblackkluare:72These are the express incantations of the klu. Now, themethod of letting rain fall is to go near a west-facing spring and recitemany incantations above it. Put the milk of a white goat with a blackneck in the spring.

Give many chu-gtorand return home. Upon thundercoming from the east rain will fall in two days.(iii) Also, a method to let rain fall: go near the head of a south-fac-ing spring and [give] many chab-gtor. Mix three types of parched bar-ley mixed with three types of spring water and apply on your body.Place many gtor-mabefore you. Recite the above incantations manytimes, give gtor-ma, give incense and return home. Upon thunder andlightning coming from the south rain will fall in three days. Anothermethod to let rain fall is to go near the head of a northern aspectspring and make [offerings] of various sweets, milk, tufts of white wool,andchu-gtorin the spring. Face in the northern direction and make asmany of the above incantations as you can. Make many chu-gtorandreturn home. Upon thundering it will rain from the north in one day.Consequently, it is impossible for rain not to come down. This abovepart of the text is the method for letting rain fall.(iv) Collect the above and below [incantations] and bless a dagger.Confidently visualize yourself as the yi-dam. Very angrily wave the dag-ger and strike [near the spring]. Now, the method for freeing fromthe diseases of the klu. Catch snakes and frogs in a net and put intoa spring. Wave the dagger and recite these incantations:74Recite theseutterances and throw [the dagger] on the resting-place.75In this wayheavy rain will come. Also, a system for inducing rain to fall is tomake a figure of a snake from flour and reciting the above incanta-tions, wave the dagger. Recite this incantation, too: na ga nan hu lu kyila rbad. Thus saying, pour horse blood and milk into a spring andreturn home. If precipitation has been excessively induced there is adanger that hail will come.

The srid-pa’i sgra-bla (sgra-blaof existence) are regarded in Bontradition as warrior protectors with a rank far surpassing that ofordinarysgra-blaand other protectors such as mountain deities. It iscommonly cited by Bon clerics that while the mountain gods cameinto being with our world, and meet their demise at its end, thesrid-pa’i sgra-blabelong to the primal epoch—a time before there wasexistence. It is also believed that their personalities are not quite ascheckered or dangerous as the mountain deities. Nevertheless, theordinary Bon sgra-blaare tantamount to the Buddhist dgra-lha,115aform in which mountain deities often manifest.As we have seen, the srid-pa’i sgra-blaare believed to have beenemployed by the ancient spirit-mediums of Bon. In this section, wewill examine important textual material that demonstrates that, despitedoctrinal distinctions, the srid-pa’i sgra-blado in fact share many icono-graphic traits and functions with the mountain deities. The way inwhich these two classes of deities are propitiated also bears manysimilarities. In the Bon tradition, this close relationship is attributedto a common genealogical origin. As we shall see, this kinship between115Variations in the spelling of this class of deities are discussed in Snellgrove1967, p. 258 (fn. 20); Norbu 1995, pp. 60–62. The Bon sgra-blaare sometimes alsorendered as dgra-bla. The dgra-lha, like the yul-lha, are mentioned in various Tun-huang manuscripts. For an enumeration of these sources see Stein 2003, p. 605. The Mongols have certain tengri(celestial) spirits, in the form of armedheroes on horseback, that correspond to the dgra-lha. Although the syncretism thathas occurred between the two types of deities makes an analysis of their originsdifficult, it could possibly indicate that concepts of the divine were common to bothcultures in antiquity.

Such linkages may reflect a historical continuity betweenthe ancient spirit-mediumship of the srid-pa’i sgra-blaand that of thelha-ri(mountain deities) extant today. This raises a crucial question:were thesrid-pa’i sgra-blaandlha-rioriginally part of the same groupof divinities, whose identities diverged to assume the deific charac-ter that is now prevalent? Although their involvement in spirit-medi-umship and other sundry doctrinal affinities suggest an affirmativereply, this amounts to circumstantial evidence, and is not sufficient,in itself, to render a determination. Without the requisite historicaland archaeological data we will have to put aside questions aboutthe legendary spirit-mediumship of the pre-Imperial period and itslinks with thelha-pawho have practiced in Upper Tibet for centuries.Like many of the mountain deities, the srid-pa’i sgra-blaare a classof martial deities who display the costumes and weapons of war-riors. Moreover, their prime function is to fulfill the worldly con-cerns of those who petition them in the prescribed manner. Thesrid-pa’i sgra-bla, in exchange for offerings, are called upon to pro-tect their worshippers from harm and to insure their well being.Their accessibility and helpfulness to votaries would seem to explainwhy they were supposed to have been used by spirit-mediums inearly times.The biographical gZi brjidshows how sTon-pa instructed his dis-ciples in the manner in which the sgra-blaof existence are to beinvoked. This sgra-blaritual transmitted by sTon-pa for the protec-tion of his followers is thought to belong to the very distant past.According to the legendary setting described in the 14th century gZibrjid, its transmission occurred even before the Zhang-zhung king-dom had been founded. While we cannot specifically date the sgra-blaritual it is clear that it represents Bon religious material thatpredates the 14th century. According to the text, the impetus forrevealing the invocations was a demonic attack on sTon-pa whilehe and his disciples were amusing themselves.ThegZi brjid116tells us that when sTon-pa and his young disci-ples were sporting in the forest, a terrible thunderous sound, hail116Dri med gzi brjid, vol. 2, part l (’dus pa rin po che’i rgyud dri ma med pa gzi brjidrab tu ’bar ba’i rgyud (= mdo)las rgyal bu gzhon, pp. 1–177, Bod-ljongs bod yig dpe-rnying dpe-skrun khang, 2000), pp. 39–41.

Animals in the vicinity fled interror. Then, a terrific giant black demon with three eyes and fangs,riding a black dragon with conch horns and wings of fire, appearedin the sky. Holding a black crucible of molten pig-iron, the demonaimed its contents at sTon-pa’s head. By raising his arm and mak-ing a wrathful protective sign with his hand (sdig-mdzub), sTon-paforced the dragon to jerk his tail, causing the weapon to narrowlymiss him and hit a lotus tree instead. All the youth with sTon-pahad become very afraid during this spectacle and some of themfainted. Soon the assembly was revived and deeply concerned aboutsTon-pa’s safety, but he was more resplendent then ever. Throughhis great power he removed nine types of weapons and armor fromthe demon’s crucible. Afterward, wearing a smile, he joked with hisdisciples: “Aren’t you, the ones who are supposed to protect me,ashamed?”ThegZi brjidgoes on to relate that, having warded offthe attack,sTon-pa gshen-rab obtained the weapons and armor needed to invokethesrid-pa’i sgra-bla(para i).117As a prelude to these invocationsincense and offering articles are presented to the deities (para ii).The omniscient srid-pa’i sgra-blaare then invoked from their domain,which transcends the dualistic bounds of ordinary phenomena (parasiii–vi). The three sgra-blabrothers are then invoked, relatives andleaders of the wer-ma, and the bdudandbtsan(para vii). The nextinvocations are for the nine Dra-ma brothers and their armies, sgra-blaof warriors and invincible patrons of nine important types ofweapons and armor (paras viii–xiii).118These spirit-warriors and theirmartial activities are described in the text with the type of Tibetanindigenous poetic verses we are familiar with from the liturgies forthe mountain gods (para xi). Once the sgra-blaare present at the ritualvenue they are given their requisite offerings (paras xii–xiv). This isfollowed by requests made to the deities (paras xv, xvi), a ritual sequenceto the smrang(ritual narrative material) and cho-rabs(origin myth) of the originalseven ancestors of the dMu clan.

There are also semantic affinities in theoffering regime of the respective ritual texts. Individually, many ofthese similarities can be attributed to the common tradition of Tibetanprotective deities (srung ’khor), but taken as a whole they point to aclose relationship between the srid-pa’i sgra-bla andyul-lha.This isparticularly true when both groups serve as ancestral gods (mes kyilha/srid-pa’i lha). Before the gZi brjidritual begins, sTon-pa proclaimsthesgra-blaancestral protective deities (para i). Likewise, the yul-lhaare ancestral protective deities—as typified by the kinship appella-tions often applied to them, such as A-myes/spo-spo/mes-po(grand-father),A-phyi/I-pi/A-pi/A-ye(grandmother)mes/myes(ancestor),jo-bo(elder brother), jo-mo(elder sister), and pho-lha(father spirit).172In order to conduct the invocation ritual to thesrid-pa’i sgra-bla,sTon-pa assembles the requisite offerings (incense, dairy products,meat, blood, beer, etc.). While these are standard objects offered tomany classes of srung-ma(protective deities), the selection of offeringsis most appropriate for those deities who exhibit both good and badtendencies towards human beings, such as the various mountain andlake divinities. The srid-pa’i sgra-blaassume the form ofkhyungandhawks (para ii), predatory birds that the lha-rialso frequently man-ifest as.173Thesrid-pa’i sgra-blaare attributed with the defense ofthree important tribes or proto-clans of Tibet, the Phywa, dMu andgTsug (para vi). Similarly, the lha-riare also assigned the status oftribal and proto-clan protectors, but their ultimate ancestors are thePhywa.174This is allegorical evidence to show that the srid-pa’i sgra-blaoccupy a more fundamental cosmogonic position then the lha-ri.172These appellations are reminiscent of the genealogical relationship betweenpeople and mountain deities in the ancient cosmogonies. For example, in the ori-gin myths of early kings and mountain deities they are linked in a parental rela-tionship (cf. Karmay 1996: 61). The ancestral relationship between the Tibetansand gNyan-chen thang-lha is discussed in Bellezza 1997, pp. 44–48; 2001, pp.76–78; Part Three, section i.173gNyan-chen thang-lha commonly manifests as a khyung, a hawk or a falcon.See para i in the Phur-pa stod-chatext, p. 179 For Buddhist textual references seeBellezza 1997, p. 58.174ThedBu nag mi’u ’dra chags, a text preserving an indigenous origin myth, recordsthat the mountain deities and human beings both arose from the Phywa race(Karmay 1998: 250, 251, 266)."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"spirit-mediums in the bon literary tradition389This crucial difference between the two classes of deities is used inBon to theologically demonstrate that thesrid-pa’i sgra-blaare a supe-rior group. However, there are still many other links tying themclosely together. The sgra-blarNo-gcod is called the leader of thebtsan(btsan gyi dpon) (para vii), while rTa-rgo ngo-dmar lha-btsan isknown as the btsanking (btsan rje rgyal po) (see Part Three, section iii,p. 235). Likewise, Nam-ra is repeatedly called the king of the btsan(btsan gyi rgyal-po) (see Part Three, section v, pp. 266–272), a com-mon appellation for other important mountain gods as well. Thusthe noteworthy role of presiding over the terrestrial btsanspirits isassigned to both the srid-pa’i sgra-blaand the mountain gods.In the gZi brjidritual the three sgra-blabrothers known as gingaresaid to reside on the world mountain Ri-rab (para vii) and the Dra-ma brothers on the mountain of the dmu(para x). While these areunderstood to be metaphorical attributions relating to the exaltednature of the sgra-bla, they nevertheless, find strong resonance in thecult of mountain deities. It is after all commonplace to refer to moun-tain gods as sgra-bla/dgra-lha. In Bon tradition, thesgra-blaof moun-tains have a lower status than thesrid-pa’i sgra-bla. In therTa danggnyis kyi bskang bawe have already seen how rTa-rgo was called thesgra-blaof gold miners, as well as being generally equated with thisclass of deities. gNyan-chen thang-lha is also popularly called adgra-lha, as is Gangs-ri lha-btsan, Nam-ra, Rol-pa skya-bdun, etc.The martial appearance of the Dra-ma sgra-bla—mounted on horses,brandishing weapons and regimental banners (paras vii–x)—is clas-sic imagery, used in literary sources and the oral tradition to describethelha-riand their circle of btsan, gnyanand other deities. The choiceof trisyllabic indicators to vividly portray these warrior deities andprovide stress in the verses (para xi) are indigenous literary devicescommon to both the sgra-blaandyul-lhatexts. These commonaltiesin literary style extend beyond prosody to the language used to peti-tion the deities, and includes analagous exhortations and admonish-ments (para xii). Unlike the more worldly deities, the srid-pa’i sgra-blado not have to be reminded of their oath to uphold the Bon doc-trines. However, in the gZi brjidritual their attention is demandedin much the same way, as found in texts dedicated to the yul-lha(para xii).The specific choice of animals in the gZi brjidritual is also telling.In addition to everyday livestock, we find mention of deer, onagers,antelope and gazelles (para xiii), animals indigenous to Upper Tibet,"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"390part four and ones frequently gifted to theyul-lhaof the region. Regarding theuse of these offerings, it is popularly cited that the lha-riand otheryul-lhamanifest as wild ungulates, as well as having these animalsunder their custodial care. The gZi brjidalso makes specific mentionof tigers, leopards, black bears and brown bears being offered to thesrid-pa’i sgra-bla(para xiii), precisely the kinds of animals that featurein texts to other members of the indigenous pantheon.The choice of ritual language underscores the interrelationshipbetween the environment-bound deities and srid-pa’i sgra-bla. Like themountain deities,thesrid-pa’i sgra-blamust be asked not to harm theofficiants of the ritual (para xiv). This ambivalence imbues the srid-pa’i sgra-blawith the type of personality characteristic of mountaingods, not one that would appear to be inherently superior. It mustalso be noted that the rten(support) for the sgra-blaused in the gZibrjidritual is comprised of arms and armor (paras xv, xvi), exactlythe kinds of support used by thelha-ri. Moreover, the requests madeto the sgra-blafor protection (para xvi) are similar to those addressedto thelha-ri. For example, we have seen how both the srid-pa’i sgra-blaandyul-lhaserve as travel gods (lam-lha). In conclusion, these far-ranging links between the yul-lhaand srid-pa’i sgra-bla seem to beindicative of a shared historical theogony. Nevertheless, it is not atall certain how and when Bon doctrinal distinctions between the twoclasses of deities arose.Transliteration of gZi brjidextract(i) de nas yang zhal nas / bswo Om ge du U dug

In this account the ultimate origin of all things isspace from which appear diverse forms, and then the cosmogoniccouple Sangs-po ’bum-khri and Chu-lcam rgyal-mo (para i). Varioustypes of primal deities succeed them including the couple Khri-lhagang-bu and dMu-btsun ’phrul-mo, who begot four sons (para ii).One of their sons is Khri-shes dkar-po who begot ethereal humanbeings. From them Mi-rje (Lord Man) and his consort Lha-mo snang-ma produced four sons, among whom is Shed-las-skyes, the leaderof primal human beings (para iii). His progeny gave rise to Srid-paye-smon rgyal-po and Chu-rlung rdzu ’phrul, whose three sons werethe progenitors of the Phywa, dMu and gTsug proto-lineages (parav). These three lineages are recorded as each originating from adichotomous valley and mountain, or lake and rocky formation (parasvii, viii), preserving the ancient dyadic cosmogonic arrangement foundprimarily in the oral tradition. As we have seen, in the sgra-blarit-ual attributed to gShen-rab, the patron sgra-blaof the Phywa, dMuand gTsug inhabit the same two-tiered geographic realms. Throughthe Phywa lineage, various types of deities, including the mountaingods appeared (para vi). Through the dMu lineage the four castesof humans appeared; among them were the six Tibetan royal clansand the populations of some adjoining countries (para vii). The gTsuglineage also gave rise to the populations of countries in the generalvicinity of Tibet (para viii).In the theogonic sequence described in the Bon gyi bstan ’byung,176the ancestralsgra-blaof thegZi brjidare noted: gSer-seng g.yu yi175Seeg.Yung drung bon gyi bstan ’byung phyogs bsdus, chapter two (Srid rtse nas narag bar gyi srid pa nang bcud sems can gyi ’gro ba drug grub tshul, pp. 22–42), written bydPal-ldan tshul-khrims, Bod-ljongs mi-dmangs dpe-skrun khang: Lhasa, 1988, pp.31–33. Regarding the content the author writes, “These [passages] are the tradi-tion of origination according to the mDzad-mdo(gZi-brjid)”. See last line of thetransliteration.

Indications arethat the Nyi zer sgron mawas authored circa the 14th century.

The implication of this relationship is clear:the mountain gods, other environment-bound deities, and the srid-pa’i sgra-blashare a common descent; the degree of propinquity beingas near as first cousins:( i) The origin of people and other living beings is infinite space, fromwhich appeared the dbyings-dgu.178Among them, from the thought oftraced to earlier sources such as the dBu nag mi’u ’dra chags.

Thefoundations were made from iron. The four corners were decorated with gold. Thewindows were crystal and agate. The cornices were turquoise. The lcog(battlements)were made from conch. The roof was covered by many crystal designs. If viewedfrom the outside the inside was seen, and if viewed from the inside the outside wasseen (a transparent quality). Inside of that [castle], upon a throne of various kindsof precious materials, was the father sTag-cha yal-yol. On his body was a greatslag(robe) of gold* with sleeves of crystal and turquoise trim. From each of thehairs on his body appeared a cavalry of soldiers. In his hands he held a ’gying ’khar(scepter or baton) of gold and reposed [on his throne].”* This line includes the word ma-thung, which does not appear to have any con-textual meaning.178Thedbyings-dguare the nine qualities of space: 1) mu med-pa(endless), 2) ’byams-yas-pa(uniform), 3)rgya-ma chad-pa(unbounded), 4)kha-gting med-pa(without a sur-face or depth), 5) dpag-tu med-pa(immeasurable), 6) dog-pa med-pa(unrestricted), 7)bdal-pa chen-po(all-pervading), 8) zad-pa med-pa(interminable), 9) ’gyur-pa med-pa(unchanging)."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"396part four the self-aware mind, appeared the formless lha-srin,179and then therealms of form, and then came the couple Sangs-po ’bum-khri of exis-tence and the great mother Chu-lcam rgyal-mo.

I providean abbreviated account here (I have prepared a full translation of this theogony,which will appear in a subsequent work): From Sang (= Sangs) po [’bum khri]appeared Srid-rje, who had eighteen sons. His eldest son Lha-rab (= rabs) gnyen(= gnyan) rum rje coupled with Sri-lcam dur-ma and begot three sons: ’Phrul-cha’al ’ol, Khri-cha ’al ’ol and sTag cha ’al ’ol. From the former two descended thelhalineage, most of which became the stars and planets, and the miraculous lhalineage, which became the lha-ma yin(demigods) of the savage g.yen-khams(cosmo-logical and deity realms). The son of the union of sTag-cha ’al ’ol and ’Tsham-zakhyad-khyud was the lord Yab-lha bdal-drug, who was also known as Lha’i dbang-po brgya-byin. He had altogether 33 consorts and seven beautiful sons. From theyoungest three sons emerged the lineages of the thugs-kargods,thugs-dmar sprin, andthegnyan, ma-sangsandyul-lhaof existence. The middle son of sTag-cha ’al ’ol,Khri-sad ber-bdun tshig or Lha-rabs gnyan-rum rje, was sent by his father to bethe king of the world.

This blood-price took the form of zoomorphic dgra-blawhose function was to protect the clans (paras iv, v).The six clans however, were not satisfied with their compensationand resolved to take their revenge on the bdud, whom they heldresponsible for the death of Khri-tho chen-po.

The two smaller clans, dBal and lDa, arenot recorded as even attempting an attack on the bdud.

This ancient deity called Ku-spyi ser-bzhis, isfirst mentioned in Pelliot 1038in conjunction with the ancestry ofthefirst Tibetan king (Karmay 1998: 396). From the wisdom radi-ance of Ku-byi mang-ske appear Gangs ti-se and mTsho ma-phamwho unite to produce Ge-khod (para ii). This account eschews theprimitive mythic theme of the mother-lake and father-mountain mat-ing and instead couches their union in the doctrinally correct ter-minology of the merging of radiant syllables, which embody wisdomand skillful means. In his narrative, the author sets out nine stagesin the theogonic chain, reiterating that from the light of Ti-se andMa-pang g.yu-mtsho an egg appeared, which hatched as Ge-khodbefore being magically transformed into a sgra-bla, in the form of afierce yak (para iii). Presumably, dKar-ru grub-dbang based his ac-count on a fund of earlier myths but, be that as it may, it does illus-trate the nexus that exists in Bon tradition between the pantheon ofmountain and lake spirits, the ge-khoddeities and the srid-pa’i sgra-bla.In the Ti se’i dkar chagtheogony, the sgra-blawild yak lands onthe north side of Ti-se and shakes the world into submission (paraiv). The text explains that this is why the old name of ’Bri-ra phug240is dBal-chen lha-bab ri, the mountain where the god Ge-khoddescended:241(i) Ku-byi mang-ske, the lhaof miracles, had an effulgent beryl andturquoise complexion.

In the second instance, descentcame forth through the lhaof bright light. In the third instance, theemanation was manifested through the light of the mountain and lake.In the fourth instance, the source emerged from a jeweled egg. In thefifth instance, the gap opened itself automatically. In the sixth instance,the manifestation emerged as dBal-chen ge-khod.

These include drum-skins madefrom the skins of wild ungulates, a custom with some currency amongthe spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet. We are informed that the drumconquers enemies, which is the same affirmation made by the spirit-mediums (para vi). It also realizes the desires of the lha ’dre(parasvii, ix, xii), a group of primitive spirits that occupy the upper andlower planes respectively of the dichotomous universe. In prevailinglamaist conceptions, they are conceived in dualistic terms of divinelhaand demonic ’dre, but that is clearly not the sense portrayed inthernga-rabs. According to legend, in very early times, in the periodbefore weaving and woodworking, when the Tibetans lived in stonehuts (rdo yi khang-bu), caves and cavities in the ground, the lhaandsrinand humans lived in close association (Tenzin Namdak 1997:15). It is also said that in the beginning Tibet had six successive erasruled by non-humans, and it was in this period that the lha, srinandhumans were not separated (ibid.: 15). However, as time went on,the kinship between humans and the spirits of the earth and skydiminished:2726This text is found in the volume of ritual worship for the Bon protector sTag-la me ’bar entitled sTag la’i sgrub pa(New Collection of Bon bka’ brten, vol. 143,nos. 601–605). The last three lines inform us that this gter-ma(revealed text) containsthe exoteric, inner and secret aspects of the lineage of the drum, which were takenout of Mount Pom-ra by sPrul-sku kyu-ra’i rnal-byor (see para xiii of transliteration).27See Tenzin Namdak 1997, p. 15: De ’og bskal par zhang zhung bod dang khams /"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"bon literary references to the ritual implements429In the subsequent era, the territories of Zhang-zhung and Tibet weregradually separated, and humans gradually learned [technological] activ-ities. The orders of the lhaandsrinand others resided in the moun-tains, rocks and rivers, and were continuously born of the sameextraction. They did not actually have corporeal forms and were invis-ible to humans. The humans and lha ’drehad less and less association.They could not see each other, and their residences and beings weredisassociated.ThesTag la me ’bar gyi rnga rabstells us that the drum is extremelypowerful (para viii), and that the celestial variant fulfills the desiresof the yul-lhaand other environment-bound spirits (para ix). Moreover,the drum controls all the unruly spirits of the underworld (para x),a source of disturbance for human beings, according to the spirit-mediums.In the theogonic sequence of the rnga-rabs, it states that the fatherand mother of the drum are the wood of the lhaand the herbs ofthesman(para viii), maintaining the ancient dyadic arrangement oforigination pertaining to a sky-father and earth-mother. This kindof lore helps to explain why in divination rites the drum is oftenthought of as a model of the cosmos, as well as being able to reachbeings throughout existence. In the last portion of the text, the drumis portrayed as both an apotropaic device and an instrument thatsatisfies the Bon protectors and all other sentient beings (paras x–xiii):(i)Kye-ma!28The astonishing and marvelous drum.

In the excerpt of the Bon dung-rabs45presented below, the use of the conch is said to have begun in theprimal epoch. Its application in subduing enemies and demons findsresonance in the ceremonial performances of the lha-pa,as does itsability to invoke the full range of environment-bound deities.Thedung-rabsexcerpt begins with the use of the conch by celes-tial Bon practitioners for subduing the chthonic ’dre and srin(para i).During this primal period the conch was used to vanquish power-45This Bon gSar-ma text is dPal chen drag po rngam pa’i thugs rgyud las / dung rab(= rabs) sgra rgyal ’brug dbyangs.It is found in the volume entitled Mi shig gu drug(New Collection of Bon bka’ brten,vol. 62, nos. 75–87; excerpt translated: nos. 78,ln. 5 to 80, ln. 5).

In similar fashion, themda’ daris also used by other types of ritual practitioners who do not act asmouthpieces for divinities.61In fact, its application in g.yang-sgrub(ritesfor the propitiation of good fortune) is extremely widespread, par-ticularly in Upper Tibet. These general applications of the arroware reflected in various Bon texts.Let us first examine an excerpt from a gsol-khatext62which describeshow the mda’ daris to be made so that it can become the body,speech and mind support of theyul-lha(paras i, ii). Its constructionand function, as detailed in this text, represent the most widespreadform of the ritual arrow.63In the text, the me-longis specifically men-tioned as the thugs kyi rten(mind support) of the yul lha(para ii), pre-cisely the manner in which it is used by thelha-pa. The mda’ dar,along with various livestock offerings, is then used to propitiate theyul-lhaso that the herds are greatly increased, human and veterinarydiseases avoided, and all enemies (human and non-human) subju-gated (paras iii, iv). The dual apotropaic and fortune-bestowing func-tions of the arrow as described in this text, fully parallel the ritualpractices of thelha-pa, and provide the philosophical basis for itsusage. The text also enumerates a series of livestock with the sameharm-repelling, fortune-attracting powers as the arrow. This workstresses the augmentation of wealth in terms of livestock generation,which is especially relevant to pastoral Upper Tibet (para iii):(i) Kyai! We erect the support of the mind for you mightyyul-lha. Thebamboo with three joints is sought in the forest groves of the south.[ The arrow] is adorned with the feathers of the lammergeier. It isdecorated with beautifully colored vermilion. Its tip is of a very sharpand hard gnam-lcags(celestial iron). On the shaft five types of coloredcloths are tied.

Thunentails the use ofincantations to create powerful weapons out of seeds, stones, blood,and armaments.

This is followedby the thunritual and finally, the destruction of the enemies andtheir transformation into innocuous entities.Just like the spirit-mediums, the thunuse various types of mustardand rape seeds for attacking enemies.

Known asg.yang ’gugs, this attraction of good fortune is part of the spirit-medium’slha-gsolandklu-gsol, as well as standing alone as its own ritual per-formance.g.Yangis the potentiality, capability or power for good for-tune found in people, animals, deities, and other auspicious objectsexpressed in terms of good luck, wealth, happiness, and all otherpositive qualities and conditions. It is commonly thought to existwith a phenomenon known as phya/phywa—the undifferentiated capa-bility for good fortune and auspiciousness, which serves as the basisfor human sustenance and endeavor (1).115In a text found in the collection of the Bon master Bru-ston rgyal-ba (born 1242), entitled Whirling Auspiciousness Summoning the g.Yang,there is a ritual for beckoning multifarious forms of g.yang.116Ratherthan actually authoring this text, it is more likely that Bru-stonredacted it from g.yang ’gugsrituals already in existence. The text isreplete with grand, evocative verses that reflect Tibetan indigenoustradition in all its glory and splendor. The content includes lovelygoddesses of the universe, the great clans of Tibet, and charmingmetaphors derived from the tent. Except for the last two stanzas,115According to sGra ’grel,phywameans everlasting life (g.yung-drung gyi tshe) andg.yangis the essence (bcud) of life. See Karmay 1998, p. 179 (fn. 31).116Theg.Yang ’gug bkra shis ’khyil bais found in a volume of Bru-ston’s entitledgZungs ’dus pod gnyis pa(mostly contains mantras and recitations) (New Collection ofBonbka’ brten, vol. 2, nos. 469–479)."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"bon literary references to the ritual implements457the work was composed in lines of seven syllables. According to theBon view, the g.yang ’gugswas part of the corpus of pre-Imperial Bonreligious traditions practiced from the remote past. Nevertheless, thefouryi-damdeities of the cardinal directions and nine sman-moof theg.yang(paras i–iii) in Bru-ston’s text, belong to the archaic pantheon.Theseyi-damdeities call the ritualists’ capability for good fortuneusing the metaphor of a stake (phur) and cord (thag) (para i). Thenineg.yang-smansisters are each associated with a class of elementaldeity, who tend to diverse boons, such as the augmentation of thelife-span, livestock, grain reserves, and the prowess of the ritualists.The text and spirit-mediums both agree that the characteristic beingsof the srid-pa-gsum, the lha(upper realm),gnyan(intermediate realm)andklu(lower realm), are instrumental in the good fortune of humanbeings and livestock (para ii).Like the spirit-mediums, the elements of the g.yang—the mountain,lake, horses and yaks—are all convoked to circle the material assem-blage that accompanies the ritual (para iv). Although this is notspecified in the text,the ritual customarily includes food and jewelofferings,mda’ dar, and various other objects. A yul-lhafigure of thesouth also participates in the ritual as the deliverer of the good for-tune of wealth (para v). The g.yangof the sky, earth, sun and moon(para vi), as well as divine figures of good fortune, are invokedthrough meditation (para vii) in order that the phywaandg.yangofthe ritualists are increased. The next interval of the text employs themetaphor of a spear festooned with flags and yak hair tassels as rep-resentative of the Rus-chen, the four or six great clans of Tibet (paraviii). This is not surprising, for in ancient times, the mdung-darwastherten(support) of clan protective deities in Upper Tibet. The var-ious types of g.yangassociated with the clans are preserved for theritualists’ enrichment.The next section of Whirling Auspiciousness Summoning the g.Yangspecifies a large variety of g.yangtypes, which the ritualists desire tohave bestowed on themselves (para ix). This is followed by the call-ing of the g.yangof foursgra-blain the form of a khyung, lion, tigerand lammergeier (para x). These recall the auspicious animals thatserve as g.yangspirits for the spirit-mediums. Other types of sgra-blaare also mentioned (para xi). The text concludes with the consum-mation of the g.yang ’gugs(para xii), which entails reminding the phywaandg.yangthat they must not falter in providing manifold types ofgood luck.

Such presents are thought to prevent or cure illnesses, insurethe well-being of the household, and augment herd size.The animals to be selected must be healthy, free of physical defectsand have well-shaped horns. Customarily, their horns are decoratedwith red ochre and dabs of butter, and colored strips of cloths andtassels are suspended from their ears, withers and tails. Designs inred ochre are sometimes drawn on the backs of the animals as well.Some’brog-pareport that these designs represent the saddle of thedeity. Typically, these markings are in a checkerboard pattern, butthere are many family and regional variations. There is some indi-cation among well-informed elders that at one time each clan hadits own particular ochre design. In La-stod byang-ma (A-zur town-ship, Nyi-ma county), the linear pattern on the right side of the ani-mal symbolizes that this gift subdues all enemies and obstructions,while the curvilinear pattern on the left side symbolizes that the ani-mal will bring happiness and profit to the owner. Once the animalis duly prepared, incense is burnt, and blessed barley grains andwater from a sacred spring or lake are sprinkled over it, to theaccompaniment of an invocation. A typical invocation runs:152bSwo, bswo! May the piece of wool in the left [hand] be the auspiciousand happy aid. May everything be good. bSwo! It is the aid of humanlife. It is the aid of the nor-g.yang(capability for increase in livestock).Thekhram153in the right [hand] conquers the shi ’dre(demons of death).It conquers the gson ’dre(demons of life). It conquers all harm.In some cases, invocations are specifically tailored to the recipientdeity. For example, in A-zur township, when the mountain god Pho-lha shel-rgyung is invoked he is called Mi-dkar rta-dkar (White ManWhite Horse). Once the animal is gifted to the deities it is permit-ted to lead the rest of its days unmolested. It becomes the rten, orphysical support, of the deity. The recipient deity accepts the ani-mal as a gift and may use it for riding. In certain instances they arebelieved to mate with it or take possession by entering the animal.152Recorded in Khyung-tshang township, Nag-tshang (Nyi-ma county): bswo bswog.yon bal legs shig legs shig skyor ma / legs shig bswo / mi’i tshe skyor yin / nor g.yang skyorma yin / g.yas khram yin shi ’dre kha lo khram mo / gson ’dre kha lo khram mo / gnod pathams cad khram mo /.153Apparently, this is the khram-shing, a board inscribed with crosshatches usedin wrathful magical practices."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"468part fiveThe traditional scheme of animal offerings in Upper Tibet is asfollows:154Pho-lhaandyul-lha—white male yaks (lha-g.yag dkar-po, zhol-po), whitesheep (lha-lug dkar-po, don-po) and white horses (lha-rta dkar-po).bTsan—bay-colored (kham-pa) yaks, red goats and sheep, and whitesheep with red faces (lug-dmar-rtsa).mGon-po(for those families who have this class of deity as theirphugs-lha)—all-black (rog-po) yaks and sheep.Klu-moandmo-lha—bluish female yaks, horses, goats and sheep.In contiguous Seng ’khor and Rus ’thor, a region with a highproportion of ancient clans, the tradition of gifting specially markedanimals to the rus-lha(protective clan god) has survived. bTsan kham-nag of the dPon-pa clan receives a sheep with a white head andsorrel-colored body. The ’A-ba clan offers a white sheep with redmarkings around the mouth and eyes to its unnamed rus-lha.A-bse-gro rwa-dkar of the Seng ’khor clan receives a brown sheep withwhite horns. mGon-btsan of the Gu-rub clan is the recipient of ablack sheep with white markings on its head in Ru ’thor, and ageneric red btsan-lug(sheep of the btsan) in Seng ’khor.In the village of Khyung-lung, in Gu-ge, there was a song extollingan abundant pastoral harvest that was regularly sung until 1959.The few native elders remaining in the village still remember threeprominent lines from this song, which include what are probablyZhang-zhung and Tibetan bilingual references to female livestock.In these verses the Zhang-zhung language term precedes the Tibetan.154A precedent for such livestock practices is found in PT 1060(Choix de DocumentsTibétains Conservés à la Bibliothèque Nationale Complété par Quelques Manuscrits de L’ IndiaOffice et du British Museum, vol.

This text notes that horses which belongto certain classes of deities cannot serve as the do-ma, the funerary horse that guidesthe soul of the deceased to the ‘happy land’ (dga’ yul), the paradise where the ances-tral deities (mtshun) reside. The colorations and markings of these contraindicatedhorses vary according to the deity to which they are gifted. In their descriptionsthe word shuis often used, referring to an unknown appearance or aspect of ahorse. The horses and the deities associated with them are as follows: horse of thelha—whiteshu; horse of the bdud—blackshu;dmu—shu-bowith a white muzzle, anda horse with a chestnut coat and a white muzzle; dmu’ (same class as dmu)—bluehorse with a white muzzle; [lhaof the] stars—white she’u-rigs/ris(?); [lhaof the]rainbow—redlu-shu(?) and shu-bowith a white muzzle; srin—’ol-ba(?) with a whitemuzzle and a black horse with a variegated mane; gnyan—blue horse with a lightgray tail; klu—red horse (mtshal-bu) with a white muzzle; sman—shu-mowith whitelower legs in front; [lhaof the] moon—bright light gray horse; and [lhaof the]sun—bluezhung-po(?)."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"bon literary references to the ritual implements469The dialectal word for female yak is zil-li, which appears to be avariant of a word we have already encountered: zil-mo.155The versesread: “The castle of yellow butter of the zil-li ’bri-mo(female yak).The castle of milk of thetshid-tshid156ra-ma(female goat).

The active regard for othersembodied in this morality closely corresponds with the Mahayanaideal of altruism (bodhicitta), however; the physical setting and pro-tagonists in the account belong to native Tibetan tradition. As thetale is set in the early period, it is worth raising the question ofwhether the pre-Buddhist religions of Tibet and the MahayanaBuddhism of India had a code of ethics with certain philosophicaldimensions in common.Texts such asMu ye pra phud phywa’i mthur thugshare the lyricismof archaic Tibetan literature, and indeed the g.yang ’gugsritual isattested in the Tun-huang manuscripts (Karmay and Nagano: viii,xi).181The text begins with prostrations to the various deities of theg.yangand instructions for making the ritual gtor-maknown as ’brang-rgyas.182This is followed by the cho-rabs(attestation of ritual origins)of the g.yangdeer, which is written in smaller print than the mainbody of the ritual. This narrative is skillfully rendered in verse withseven syllables in each line. As in other Bon etiologic myths, theultimate cosmogonic principle is the void in which a light appears(para i). From this light all the animate and inanimate features ofthe universe come into being. Along with the four elements of wind,fire, water, and earth, mountains and lakes are recorded as a pri-mary engendering factor of existence, reflecting the importance ofthis geographic dyad in the cosmogonies of the oral tradition. Accordingto the text, in the beginning of existence, humans appeared in con-junction with their deities, underlining the way in which these twoentities share the same ontological and genetic basis in indigenousTibetan tradition.181In an Indian Office Tun-huang manuscript published by Thomas practition-ers known as lha-bon,g.yang-bonandphya-bonperformsku-bla(protective rites) andg.yang du blang(raising up the good fortune capability) rites (Stein 2003: 596, 597).182The beginning of the text reads: “We prostrate to the four: phywa, gnyan, g.yanggsas, and mu-ye pra-phud; the five types of great gsas, the fivelhabrothers, and allthelha-moof the g.yang. Firstly, the ’brang-rgyasof the phywahas a round base andsquare superstructure. On the square [superstructure] make two mkhar-thabs(castle-like structures) surmounted by flaming jewels.

The god Phywa/Lha-sras sgam-po volunteers to bringback the phywasupport and seeks the help of the great goddessgNam-phyi gung-rgyal, who directs him to an island located on thenorth side of the world mountain Ri-rab lhun-po (para iii). Thisisland and lake are the residence and soul repositories of the magicstag Crystal Horned Conch Deer. The abode of this deer of thephywaandg.yangillustrates the sacred geomantic qualities of islandsin Tibetan geographic conceptions. Imbued with a secret or inner-most aspect and occupying the most exclusive of locations, the geo-graphic source of the phywaandg.yangrecalls the string of earlygsas-mkhar/gsas-khang(temples) located on the islands of Upper Tibetanlakes (Bellezza 2001: 23–25).In the dialogue that follows between Phywa/Lha-gsas sgam-po andCrystal-Horned Conch Deer we learn that the various deities of goodfortune actually reside on the deer (para vi), a belief still held bythe’brog-paregarding choice livestock. The text also makes referenceto the bdud kyi chu-bzhi(the four rivers of the bdud) (para vi), whichmay have some correspondence with the Chu-bo bzhi, the four greatrivers of western Tibet.183It is only after much disputation thatCrystal Horned Conch Deer is enticed to return to the land of thephywagods (paras v–x). Phywa/Lha-sras sgam-po promises the stagthat he will be given excellent food and drink, decorated with ver-milion and indigo, and ornamented with cloths, gold and turquoise(para xi), providing the mythic criteria for the custom of g.yangani-mals still prevalent today. The cho-rabsstates that the stag was treatedas promised including being kept in a special corral (para xii). Thismay suggest that deer were once domesticated in Tibet.184Thenarrative concludes by affirming that the deer was instrumental in the establishment of the phywaandg.yangof the ancestral gods(para xii):185183See Part One, section iv, p. 48 (fn. 47).184The domestic deer is alluded to in the Old Tibetan Chronicle(Uray 1972: 10).An ancient petroglyph of an anthropomorph riding a stag is found at Lha-klu mkhar(Suolang Wangdui 1994: 167).185See Karmay and Nagano 2002, Text 2, folios 1b, ln. 1 to 9a, ln. 4.

of historical continuity. The Bon textual tradition places its ori-gin in the pre-Imperial period, and cultural historical evidence indi-cates that it has come down to us with many of its ancient featuresintact. While Bon claims for the pre-Buddhist antiquity of spirit-mediumship cannot be independently corroborated, the character ofthis religious tradition and its role in the region’s culture have beenexplored in some detail. As we have seen, spirit-mediumship and thecult of territorial deities act as a kind of bridge between indigenousand Buddhist culture, a vortex where two great traditions meet andmerge with one another. This syncretism is one of the distinguish-ing characteristics of Tibetan religious culture.Although the indigenous aspects of spirit-mediumship are amongthe most notable legacies still surviving in the culture of Upper Tibet,they are but a fraction of the region’s native cultural patrimony.This hoary heritage extends to botanical and celestial lore, clan lin-eages, hunting and pastoral practices, among many other customsand traditions. One of the most trenchant signs of the persistenceof old cultural forms is found in personal ornamentation and thecontinued usage of gzistones and thog-lcagsas amulets, some of whichare probably of pre-Imperial origin. Until quite recently, they wereoften assiduously handed down from one generation to the next.Another graphic sign of the survival of the native heritage in UpperTibet is the widespread usage of timeworn personal names, such asLha-rtse, Jo-rgod, Lha-klu, and mTsho-mo, to mention but a few.Taken as a whole, these elements reflect a cultural conservatism thatis probably more pronounced than anywhere else in the Tibetan cul-tural world, with the notable exception of certain peripheral regionsof the Tibetan plateau.This study of spirit-mediumship in Upper Tibet is Tibetologicalin nature—with its reliance on Tibetan cultural materials. It hasfocused on the practices and traditions of the spirit-mediums, usingboth ethnographic and textual tools of analysis. Stress has been placedupon an exposition of the initiation of the spirit-mediums, their pan-"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"conclusion485theon of operational deities and spiritual benefactors, their ritualinstruments, and the techniques they employ in healing, exorcismand safeguarding environmental homeostasis. The extensive use ofprimarily Bon texts has aided in the elucidation of the professionwith its diverse patterns of ritual, tradition and worship, and hasserved to delineate its place within the ambit of Tibetan religion.The manifold interconnections that exist between the oral tradi-tion of the spirit-mediums and that of Tibetan religion enshrined inliterary records demonstrate how closely related these two modes ofcultural transmission are. Such a relationship establishes that thereis little distinction between cleric-based and folk-based non-Buddhistreligious practices in Upper Tibet. As discussed in Part One, a pos-sible explanation for this common ground may be that both the lit-erary and oral traditions are heirs to the same wide-rangingpre-Imperial cultural legacy. This hypothetical formative prehistoricbequest appears to have been strongly colored by historical devel-opments, especially those pertaining to the adoption and propaga-tion of Buddhism. This study has therefore favored seeing historicalprocesses as accounting for parallel features in the literary and non-literary components of indigenous religious culture.The Tibetan texts selected for translation in this work reconnoi-ter but a small corner of the universe of tradition stemming fromthe Upper Tibetan environment. The focus has been on the ritualsystems documented in both Bon and Buddhist works that shed lighton the way in which the spirit-mediums conduct their ceremonialaffairs. The texts studied illustrate how diverse Tibet’s homegrowntraditions are in terms of literary style, content and tone. In this sur-vey we have perused a variety of ritual works pertaining to the his-tory and character of the native pantheon and associated religiouslore. This corpus of homespun and locally modified traditions can-not be termed secular because a sacred or deistic dimension is pre-sent in virtually all of it. Nor, strictly speaking, can this native legacybe labeled as popular or folk culture because it is part and parcelof even the most exclusive spheres of traditional Tibetan social life.Additionally, it is usually assigned an august origin in Tibetan liter-ature. Although the modes of performance and liturgical design varyconsiderably, the spectrum of rituals we have examined share a common purpose in realizing immediate and tangible benefits forthose who conduct and sponsor them. This emphasis on the hereand now, of bringing material good to society, contrasts with the"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"486conclusionfocal point of Tibet’s better known soteriological literature and itspreoccupation with achieving liberation from worldly bounds.Although this work has placed little emphasis on the social statusand the community role of the spirit-mediums, it is implicit that theirsurvival into the Communist period is mainly due to perceived benefitsthat have accrued to the community at large as a result of theirpractice. Attributing their continued existence solely to blind adher-ence to tradition or a superstitious bent of mind is clearly not war-ranted. To denigrate Tibetan indigenous religious practices as backwardand dysfunctional also falls short of comprehending the prevailingrealities. Such an eminently pragmatic people as the Upper Tibetanshave continued to foster a therapeutic system that they see as pro-viding them with maximum benefits. It is in such an ideational andaspirant social context that the tradition of spirit-mediumship mustbe understood. Living in one of the most difficult environments onearth, the Upper Tibetans have developed highly efficient survivalstrategies in all vital areas of life. These include:1) A refined system of stock-rearing that accents fecundity andreduces risks that lead to catastrophic loss of livestock.2) A material culture and diet specially adapted to extremely severehigh-elevation conditions.3) Physical activities designed to harmonize with the environment.4) An emotional bearing and mindset that is attuned to the maxi-mum conservation of energy.The perception of benefits is central to why the spirit-mediums havemoved with the rest of us into the 21st century. While the efficacyof the therapeutic modes utilized by the mediums is open to scientificquestion, their role in the health care of small isolated communitiesis assured by their locally registered success. Moreover, their role ashealth care providers is strengthened by the general lack of alter-natives. The implications of this are clear: so long as modern med-ical treatment facilities remain rudimentary, the people of UpperTibet will continue to seek out traditional alternatives. In the last 50years, the practice of spirit-mediumship has met with much resis-tance, leading to a dramatic drop in the number of practitioners,particularly among those with the most social prestige. This has madeit increasingly difficult to document the profession in its entirety andcollect the data needed for the scholarly reconstruction of native reli-"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"conclusion487gious phenomena. It may also be that the disappearance of the spirit-mediums has negatively impacted healthcare in Upper Tibet.By authoring this survey it is my intention to draw attention tothe spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet, thereby stimulating further inter-est in their study and documentation. There is still a tremendousamount to learn and explore. Research projects that require spend-ing extended periods of time with the spirit-mediums would be espe-cially useful. For example, studies to identify the physical and mentalhealth benefits derived from their therapeutic techniques are needed.It is imperative that we learn exactly how the remedial system ofthe spirit-mediums functions in medical terms. Perhaps studies thatfocus on the epistemological and ontological aspects of deity possessionmight also prove useful in an attempt to understand extraordinarystates of human consciousness. Other types of relevant anthropolog-ical studies worth launching in Upper Tibet include:1) Analysis of the community roles and social status of the spirit-mediums.2) Analysis of the relationship between the spirit-mediums and othertypes of religious practitioners operating in the same geographicarea.3) Comparison of traditional Tibetan medical theory and practicewith the healing rites used by the spirit-mediums.4) Study of the social effects of modernization and political upheavalon the traditions of the spirit-mediums.5) Studies with a wider geographic purview, to include spirit-medi-ums from other areas of the Tibetan cultural world.6) Cross-cultural comparative studies of Tibetan spirit-mediums andtheir counterparts from other regions of Eurasia.The future of the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet is highly uncer-tain, as it is with analogous practitioners in many other areas of theworld. The extinction of this profession in Upper Tibet—within ageneration—seems a real prospect. While this may represent theinevitable march of progress, and the vindication of the materialist-rationalist approach to the understanding and ordering of the world,there are delicate human issues involved that are not so easily brushedaside by such triumphalism. These issues have to do with the highcaliber of people involved in the profession and the spirit of altru-ism that they characteristically embody. The spirit-mediums embrace"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"488conclusiona worldview based on active ecological and social accountability.They do not have a set fee schedule, and it is virtually unheard offor someone to be turned away for a lack of funds to pay for ser-vices. I have found that cleanliness, integrity, hospitality, and help-fulness are always the traits of the bona fide mediums of UpperTibet. As a whole, they are a group of people who have sacrificedand toiled for the good of those around them, often with little per-sonal gain.In this age of catastrophic environmental destruction, perhaps evenmore vital to social well-being than their individual integrity, is thespirit-mediums’ intricate awareness of the ecological processes thatsustain us all. The spirit-mediums of Tibet uphold an etiologic viewof disease that emphasizes the importance of individuals and com-munities continually striving for ecological integrity. Personal happi-ness and the general health of the community are directly relatedto the way in which people manage and consume natural resources.The spirit-mediums affirm that illness and misfortune are caused bynegative relationships between people, the environment and the super-natural beings that reside among them and, conversely, that healthand happiness are derived through positive interactions with the envi-ronment bound deities. Although parasites and unhealthy lifestylesare seen as the secondary causes of illness, the primary vectors ofdisease transmission are the pantheons of spirits that reside in thephysical environment. These semi-divine beings have an inherentlyambivalent relationship with human beings and thus can be friendor foe. By and large, these spirits—forces of the water, earth andsky—demand a pristine environment, impelling human beings to payclose attention to the way in which their activities shape and sus-tain the ecology.While the spirit-mediums’ understanding of personal and socialhealth is pre-modern and not rigorously scientific (e.g. it makes lit-tle, or no account, of microscopic pathogens), it might paradoxicallyprove to be one of the saner approaches to the art of living. Wecan be assured that those in wealth-holding, decision-making posi-tions will attempt to pronounce the fate of the spirit-mediums. Andwe can hope that such judgments will be made on the basis of thespirit-mediums’ value to the overall salubrity of society. Nevertheless,human beings will always strive for the greatest benefits and if theyfeel these are to be found among those who speak for the gods,the spirit-mediums of Upper Tibet will be with us for a very longtime to come."},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"terminal histories and arthurian solutions31ILLUSTRATIONS"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"chapter two60"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"terminal histories and arthurian solutions311.
