The deep significance that the Pa ̊ chenLama had for Skal ldan rgya mtsho is emphasized by the many times Skal ldan rgyamtsho mentions him in his mgur. I have followed M.

Zhabs dkar Tshogs drug rang grol (1781–1851) goes toplaces where Skal ldan rgya mtsho had meditated, receives an oraltransmission of his Gsung mgur, sings his songs, and hopes to alsostay someday in mountain retreats.7 As far as I know, from among allof Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s writings, only four of his poems had beentranslated and published in a Western language prior to my thesis.8These were two fragments by M.

On the other hand, and very surprisingly, he laterspent years in beautiful solitary places tucked away in the mountainsas a hermit whose mode of expression was songs of spiritualrealization, known as mgur. Various scholars have already noted that the genre of mgur standsout from most other forms of Tibetan literature for its startlingly andunusually sincere descriptions of inner thoughts, feelings andexperiential knowledge.11 I have found this to be true of the collec-tion of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgur, which contains invaluable auto-biographical material and information on his surroundings, andmoreover is a treasure house of styles. My objective is to use the Mgur ’bum to show Skal ldan rgyamtsho’s importance both as a distinctive figure in religious historyand as an author. My approaches here are dual. First, I will use whatSkal ldan rgya mtsho tells us in his songs about his times andhimself: his joy concerning the expansion of Buddhism into Amdo(in Eastern Tibet) and, though he was highly instrumental inBuddhism’s rise there, his need to remove himself from all formalBuddhist institutions in order to pursue his personal quest forrealization. Second, I will use examples from his songs to show Skalldan rgya mtsho as a songwriter of myriad styles, and I willhypothesize that influences from his opposing ways of life arereflected at different times in the formal structures of his songs. Here is how my two major themes are woven into the four parts ofmy book. Following this preface, in Part One I will draw upon theautobiographical and biographical material in Skal ldan rgya mtsho’smgur. First I will show how he felt about selected topics such as histimes in Amdo under Mongol dominance, how he viewed CentralTibet as the source of the teaching, and the spread of Buddhism fromthere to Amdo. Then I will present songs that show unique featuresof his religious quest. Autobiographical songs provide a wealth ofdetail about why he felt the need to leave privileged clerical positionsto become a hermit, what he was looking for, and his struggle to________11 See, for example, Roger R.

Songs about Mi la ras pa (ca. 1040-1123) give an unusually ecumenical view of seventeenth centuryDge lugs pa practitioners, in this case Skal ldan rgya mtsho and hisolder brother/teacher, who dared to emulate his way of life and tohave a deep reincarnational connection with the great eleventhcentury siddha, at a time of great tension between the Dge lugs paschool and the Karma pa sect. Furthermore, songs about Mah›mudr›reveal some of the tantric practices Skal ldan rgya mtsho and hisbrother entertained as siddhas. In Part Two I will give a brief explanation of the genre of mgur.Then I will address the reasons Skal ldan rgya mtsho gives forsinging some of the songs, who they are for, the general topics hesings about, where he is singing and other pertinent information fromthemgur and their colophons, in order to understand his relationshipto the genre. In Part Three I will give an overview of the styles of formalstructures in Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgur, including metrics, stanzapatterns and poetic figures, illustrating points with examples fromSkal ldan rgya mtsho’s Mgur ’bum. I will show that Skal ldan rgyamtsho’s dichotomous lifestyle played a large role in bringing a widerange of influences to his writing. Both his monastic upbringing andhis sympathies with folk music are reflected in the wide range of hischoices regarding metrics, stanza patterns, and poetic figures. I haveclassified the latter according to whether they hark back to theK›vy›darŸa—the circa sixth-century text of Indian poetics byDa ̊ ̃in that became a must for those writing formal verse in themonasteries of Tibet from perhaps the turn of the fourteenth centuryonwards—or are most probably indigenously Tibetan. Finally, in a coda to this book, I will describe the very alivetradition in which the songs are sung today—where they are sung, bywhom and under what circumstances. Though there is no certaintyabout the melodies that Skal ldan rgya mtsho himself sang, oraltradition claims that the present style dates back to his direct disciple,Shes rab bkra shis (1647-1716). I will analyze aspects of the melo-dic and rhythmic style briefly and hypothesize that it is heavily influ-enced by folk music from the eastern side of the Tibetan plateau, andI will supplement this book with an accompanying CD of my record-ings of the songs."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"AUTHOR’S PREFACExiv While a translation of the entire Mgur ’bum is beyond the scope ofthis book, songs which stand out as models for some of my mostimportant points appear in full translation in Appendix A.

How didhe perceive his homeland in relation to Central Tibet? Whatsolutions did he pursue for his own spiritual development and that ofhis region? And what major transformation took place in Amdoduring his and his disciples’ lifetimes? I will use quotations fromSkal ldan rgya mtsho’s Mgur ’bum as gateways into his views aboutAmdo and its problems, Central Tibet as the source of the teaching,and finally “the rising of the sun of the teaching” in Amdo. The Ordos and Tümed Mongol tribes had entered the Amdo areain the late 1500s. Gushri Khan of the Qoshot tribe led an army todefeat the Ço\u0001tu tribe there in 1637, and used Amdo as a base fromwhich to lead a successful attack in Central Tibet on the enemies ofthe Dge lugs pa school, ultimately installing the fifth Dalai Lama onthe throne of Tibet in 1642.1 In this regard, it is clear that GushriKhan and the Qoshot were directly supportive of the rise to power ofSkal ldan rgya mtsho’s sect, the Dge lugs pa school, in Central Tibet.But after the Qoshot’s big victory, many of their leaders continued tolive in their pasturelands in the Amdo area, where they and leaders ofother Mongol tribes dominated the Tibetans. What was it like to liveunder their supremacy? In Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s view, the major problem in Amdo wasthe presence of the Mongols. Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s biography is asource for how he interacted with the two Mongol rulers.2 Yet thereis a dearth of reference to any specific Mongol ruler by Skal ldanrgya mtsho himself in his Mgur ’bum. Though Skal ldan rgya mtshofelt obliged to honor and serve the Mongol governor of his region,theJu nang, while in his presence, it is noteworthy that he never________1 For more information on Qoshot Mongols and Gushri Khan, and on the role ofthe Qoshot and Gushri Khan in the enthroning of the fifth Dalai Lama, see my sup-plementary bibliography, “Sources for Historical Background.”2 For a further discussion of the Tümed governer Qoloçi, and the Ju nang, seeAppendix B."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE2praises him or any other Mongol rulers in his songs (though praisesto his lamas and others he admires are numerous), perhaps becausehe had no real praise for them. He also never criticizes any specificMongol rulers in his mgur, in keeping with the Tibetan tradition ofnot voicing criticisms with names. The absence of any specificreferences to his Mongol rulers suggests part of the story. And wecan gain more insight into how he felt about them directly from hisMgur ’bum, as he clearly feels the freedom to express in a generalway his true feelings about Mongol rulers and their domination in hismgur. For example, from a song he sang to himself in the fall of1662, Mgur XI-12,3 we learn the following:s]-d[*-dz#-zdX^r-e]n-nrn-‰Xn-dNø]! !m(c-n(e-a(n-zj‹]-az#-[^n-Nœdn-z[#c! !Nå\u0003#c-d([-zdrn-f#-v-d[*-Nœ\u0003#[-[qz! !N ́(n-D\u0002-f-’fn-v-cr-[dr-f*[! !e(n-fj°n-fj°n-e[]-y-er-v*en-[r-! !Ø-er-v*en-d;z-do^r-er-d;r-d! !m(c-n(e-a(z#-[a(]-a(z#-ve-]-x([! !4In this time in which the Buddha’s teaching, the origin of benefitand happiness,Is being seized by the Mongols,Generally it is hard for the Tibetan people to be happy.In particular, the lamas don’t have independence.________3 An explanation of my method of identifying mgur in the Mgur ’bum is in order.In the two extant woodblock editions, versions A and B, the songs appear withoutinterruption. However, in the recently published bound texts, versions C and D, themgur have been divided into chapters. Although the division of mgur into chapters ismerely a later innovation, for simplicity’s sake I have decided to identify a mgur byits chapter in versions C and D, with the belief that any reader of this book is farmore likely to have this version than either of the woodblock prints. Hence, I willuse “Mgur II-6,” for example, to designate the sixth mgur in the second chapter ofeither of the two publications of bound texts.4 Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 268-69/ 237."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE RISING SUN OF THE TEACHING IN AMDO3The most beautiful clothes, the best cushions, andThe best horses, [and] the best food and drinkAre in the hands of the Mongols’ masters.

Later, Mi la ras pa repented and searched for a master who couldgive him initiations and scriptures, yet though he practiced, he couldnot make progress due to his bad karma. He sought to study withMar pa Chos kyi blo gros (11th century), who refused to give him theteachings until he built a tower. Mi la ras pa was willing to undergoalmost any amount of torment inflicted by Mar pa in order to receivehis teachings, and built a tower and tore it down over and over forhim; Mar pa at the same time was determined to force his youngdisciple to pay back the bad karma of his earlier days by continuingto make him do the agonizing labor. Finally, Mar pa gave Mi la raspa tantric initiations. Mi la ras pa went off to solitary places to live a life of retreat as avery strict ascetic, practicing under very severe conditions of coldweather while wearing little or absolutely no clothing, and ofteneating only nettles. He taught others through stories sung spontan-eously of his own personal experience—how he subdued demonsand how he converted some of his disciples—in order to adviseothers how to live and how to practice. Although he had soughtscriptures and initiations with vigor earlier in his life, he nowshunned compulsive book-learning and complex tantric rituals.During this period he again exhibited many powers, but instead ofthe black magic of his youth, now his flying, walking across water,entering a yak horn, being impervious to arrows, transforminghimself into many bodies and so on all had the purpose of teachingothers.4 Finally, he entered Nirvana, amidst many miraculous signs.

My aim in this chapter is to betterunderstand what the genre of mgur meant to Skal ldan rgya mtsho.Let us begin by looking briefly at it within the context of all of hiswriting. Besides the mgur that were compiled in his Mgur ’bum, Skalldan rgya mtsho wrote fifty-nine other works, the vast majority ofwhich are in prose. When carved onto woodblocks, these came to fillmore than eight hundred folios. These works exist today in the firstfour volumes of a woodblock edition of his Gsung ’bum, orCollected Writings, mentioned above, and can also be read in theirnewly published version.1 The subjects of these largely prose workscan be summarized as follows: volume Ka contains a series ofbiographies, two histories of Buddhism in Amdo, and a cycle ofeulogies; volume Kha contains basic Madhyamaka instructions andfour works on Mah›mudr›; volume Ga contains cycles of guru yogaand instructions on the gradual path and meditation; and volume Ngacontains practices in relation to such deities as Bde mchog, ’Jigsbyed, Spyan ras gzigs, and Sgrol ma. While the styles of the sixty works vary considerably and there area variety of styles among the mgur as well, as a whole, Skal ldanrgya mtsho’s mgur can be distinguished from his other works in thefollowing ways: they are associated in particular with his life as arecluse; they are in verse and are intended to be sung; theirexpression is less formal and sometimes very personal; and theyshow considerable folk influence. Before going on to show directlywhat Skal ldan rgya mtsho said about singing and writing mgur, Iwill briefly summarize what Indologists and Tibetologists havewritten about the development of this genre.

Kvaerne introduces theorigin, purpose and form of the cary›gıti, and makes references towhat others have said, in the following way:The songs were originally intended to be sung. This is evidentnot only from the term cary›-gıti(gıti “song”) itself, but alsofrom the fact that a r›ga is indicated for each song in the text ofthe commentary. Each song has a refrain (dhruvapada)indicating that a chorus alternated with a soloist. CharlotteVaudeville characterizes this kind of poetry as follows, and it isworth quoting her appraisal in extenso: “Like the doh›,thep›da form seems genuinely popular inorigin: it is really a folk-song, adapted to religious purposes.Here again the Sahajiy› Siddhas, together with the Jain Munis,seem to have been the first to use popular lyrical forms topropagate their doctrines. As in the case of the doh›s, the p›dasare used to express spiritual truths in a form that is readable,accessible, and eminently pleasing to simple folk, and can easilybe memorized by them, together with the tune. The p›da'smetrical looseness is mainly due to the necessity of adapting thewords to melodic variations; it probably also reflects the________2 See R. A. Stein, Tibetan Civilization, trans. J. E.

For this reason Schaeffer considers Vajrap› ̊i (born 1017) as the mostimportant person in their transmission to Tibet.

He certainly did so from personalpreference, but also with the idea of popularizing Buddhistthought and making it more familiar by putting it into folk-songs.12Unfortunately, the source for Mi la ras pa’s mgur ’bum is a compil-ation made more than three centuries after his death and we cannotknow the original texts of his songs. Of course, many other adaptations besides the substitution ofTibetan folk songs for Indian ones as the basis for melodies had to bemade in order to transfer the style of the vajragıti into Tibet.

The Tibetan trans-lations of these collections of mystic songs gave in turn theirTibetan confrères inspiration to a new way of expressing theirreligious experience and awareness (nyams len, nyams rtogs),their meditative realization (sgrub p a) and their esotericinstructions (zhal gdams)....

But thesituation was more complex than just a proliferation of mgur, sincethere was a development in their style as well. Although songs werewritten by later composers who had read Mi la ras pa and wereinfluenced by him, the songs could contain important differencesfrom Mi la ras pa’s mgur.

These three genres, glu,mgur and snyan ngag, are related but distinguishable. Jackson states,Glu, which remains in Tibetan as a general term for “song,” isthe earliest, most indigenous, most secular, and most orally andmusically oriented of the genres. mGur, which originally waseither a synonym or a subdivision of glu, came eventually todenote a more Buddhistic type of “song,” and might be eitherTibetan or Indian in its inspiration, oral or written in its style.sNyan ngag, “speech [agreeable] to the ear,” is an ornate,written, Indian-inspired type of Buddhist (and occasionallysecular) poetry that did not appear until the thirteenth century,well after the two genres.23Hence,mgur can be situated between glu and snyan ngag.24 Ofcourse there is a wide range of qualities in the verses belonging toany of these three genres, but certain generalizations can be madeabout the characteristics of each group. Generally speaking, mgur aremore Buddhist than glu, which tend to be secular. Mgur are moreformal stylistically than glu but less formal than snyan ngag.Mgurare oral or written, whereas glu are always sung and snyan ngag arealways written. Mgur can be of Tibetan and Indian inspiration,whereasglu usually have very little Indian inspiration and snyanngag have a considerable amount.25Mguras a Means of Expression for Skal ldan rgya mtshoNow that we have looked at what some Tibetologists and Indologistshave written about the style of the vajragıti, their transmission toTibet, the inspiration that resulted in creating a new style of Tibetanverse, and some adaptations attributed to Mi la ras pa and laterwriters, let us focus on Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgur themselves: the________23 Jackson, “‘Poetry’ in Tibet,” 369-70.24 The Mah›vyutpatti gives glu as the equivalent of saªgıti, and glu dbyangs asthe equivalent of saªgıtiandgıta.

Skal ldan rgya mtsho criticizes the bees and says thatbees speaking a human language is an unlucky omen. Then the beesridicule what he has said and relate to him what they consider reallybad omens to be: the corrupt practices of monks and novices.

Mgur cycle IV-2 heavily emphasizes the theme of karma,which in turn the insects give as a reason to live a life of purity insolitude.

Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s Mgur cycles IV-1 and IV-2 areunique dialogues, whose form works very well in a variety of waysto enhance the expression of his message: “go to a solitary place inorder to practice religion.” The reasons that Skal ldan rgya mtsho should go live in solitudeare given in the form of criticism. And having criticism “come fromthe mouths of others” enables deep criticism of his way of life—thathe has been expounding religion like a parrot but without practicingit, and that he has wasted his life up to the present with “senselesssinging, dancing, eating, drinking and so on.”9 And putting criticismof monks and novices in the words of insects especially allows veryincriminating things to be stated about them: that they womanize,_________7 Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 67-71/ 61-64.8 Zhabs dkar was obviously taken and influenced by Mgur cycle IV-1, as hewrote his own conversation with bees, though in his case the bees pay homage tohim from the start. The bees refer to Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs as predecessors oftheir own songs. Harking back to Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s cycle, Zhabs dkar requeststhat they be in his retinue when he attains enlightenment:My friend the bee, come back again,And sing your songs for me, the yogin.And once I have reached enlightenment,I pray that you, bee, will join my retinue.For this, see Ricard, trans., The Life of Shabkar, 162-63. Though there are dialogues in Gtsang smyon pa’s compilation of Mi la ras pa’smgur, Mi la ras pa always performs the role of guiding the one with whom heconverses, unless the latter is a teacher.9 Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 65/ 59."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"DIALOGUES:MGUR IN CONVERSATIONS WITH ANIMALS109drink beer, fight, steal, sell religion, break their vows, cast aside theirlamas, and give more Dharma talks than anyone.10 The dialogue form allows the two sides to have not only contrast-ing points of view but markedly different types of speech and argu-mentation. Skal ldan rgya mtsho is initially haughty and short withthe insects, reflecting that he thinks that they are so far beneath himas to be not to be worth addressing. The insects, by contrast, want totake time to explain things to Skal ldan rgya mtsho carefully, articu-lately and logically. The various stages of the conversation make itpossible both for him to voice his resistance and be slowlypersuaded, and for them to respond to his objections and build theirargument and advice to him. Towards the end of each mgur cycle, hemakes the decision to change his life and behavior, based on what hehas learned from the insects. What he says is again very brief (fourlines), but this time the brevity indicates not rejection but acceptance.He has no reason to linger over words or lose any more time becausehe is eager to get to a solitary place to practice religion. Another way that the form enhances the message in these cycles isseen in Mgur cycle IV-1, in which metrical variances and theprogression of the argument go hand in hand. Here there are threedifferent meters. 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 is used for the bees’ opening criticismof Skal ldan rgya mtsho, his curt rejection of them, and theirargumentative response. The poem has fifty-three long lines of ninesyllables each, which emphasizes how much the bees are laying intohim. It should also be noted that after some variation in stanzapattern, the bees’ speech falls into distinct four-line stanzas as theygo on a roll of listing criticisms of the way monks and novices areliving. A new meter, that of 3 + 2 + 3, appears when Skal ldan rgyamtsho changes his attitude and decides that the bees are not onlyright, but have given him a teaching deeper than any he has heardfrom a hundred lamas.11 The third meter, that of 2 + 2, appears in hisbrief closing statement that he is off to meditate in solitude, referredto above. His brief statement, with merely four syllables per line overonly four lines, emphasizes the simplicity of his statement, “Friendbees, Skal ldan rgya mtsho is going to meditate. Please sing amellifluous song!”_________10 Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 66/ 60.11 Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 67/ 60."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX110 A way the form of dialogues with animals also enhances Skal ldanrgya mtsho’s overall theme of practice in solitude is demonstrated inMgur cycle IV-2, in which the nature of the insects closely corres-ponds with their teachings for him. Lice, fleas and lice eggs are bothphysically threatening to and threatened by Skal ldan rgya mtsho,who opens the cycle by saying he wants to kill them. This is an idealsetting for the discussion of karma. Furthermore, the fact that thereare three groups of insects in the cycle makes it possible for each toexpress its particular perspective on why he should live a moral lifeand go practice religion in solitude. The lice point out that whetherthey bite him or not is entirely up to his karma.12 The fleas use thetheme of their jumping, and advise him not to stay down there, but tosoar up like them, where “up on a solitary peak you’ll soar indelight.”13 The lice eggs tell him how they experience meditativestates in their meditation huts within the fabric of his clothes, andthat he also can enjoy these in solitude too, if he does not hurt them.14 The two cycles of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s conversations withanimals echo the relation of master and disciple. In each case, Skalldan rgya mtsho poses as the disciple, being lectured to by theinsects, here representing the masters. When Skal ldan rgya mtshodecides to go off to meditate in solitude, he departs from the masters.This recalls the usual path of a yogi, who having relied on a qualifiedmaster for instructions goes off to practice by himself. Note that thefleas point out that they do not eat siddhas who meditate onmountain peaks. When one becomes a solitary hermit, one is aboveearthly afflictions. In general, these are didactic statements, the insects being used asthe voice of criticism and advice. Another way of looking at thedialogues that take place in these cycles is as discussions of Skalldan rgya mtsho with his conscience. Instead of the voice of criticismremaining within his head, it is projected onto animals, making aninternal conflict into an external one. Now that we have looked in_________12 Similarly, the prelude to Mi la ras pa’s song about Sgam po pa Bsod nams rinchen (1079–1153) states that “[because of his compassion and purity], no insect evergrew on his body.” Chang comments that “It is believed that a truly compassionateBodhisattva is immune from the attacks of insects or beasts. Tibetan lamas even usethis as a yardstick to judge and measure the compassion of their fellow lamas.” SeeChang, trans., The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa, 466, 496 n. 4.13 Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 68-69/ 62.14 Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 69/ 62."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"DIALOGUES:MGUR IN CONVERSATIONS WITH ANIMALS111depth at the very unusual form of dialogues with animals, I will turnto an analysis of concepts of structural form that are widelyapplicable to all mgur.

Before doing so,I will first discuss some general characteristics of metrics in Tibet.1The choice of a particular meter is a definitive issue in the formationof a song, since other basic considerations such as language andsyntax are dependent on this decision. For this reason, we mustunderstand how meters work to gain a deeper understanding of amgur and the skill involved in writing it. I will draw extensively onsecondary literature that deals with the notion of prosody, both byDon grub rgyal, the noted Tibetan authority on mgur, and byWestern analysts. At times I will compare Western notions ofmetrics with Tibetan ones, in order to clarify the Tibetan use ofprosody, and Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s in particular. On the most basic level, the syllable (tsheg bar) count of a line ofverse (tshig rkang) defines its visual-quantitative length2 and leads toa fundamental distinction Indo-Tibetan theorists recognize betweenthose stanzas (sho lo ka) whose lines have the same number ofsyllables (tsheg bar do mnyam pa) and those whose lines do not________1Tibetan metrics are a Tibetanized Sanskrit form. While Indian meters are afunction of long and short syllables, Tibetan ones are based on accents. I thank P. SØrensen for his English definitions of Tibetan technical termsregarding metrics, found in Divinity Secularized, 12-28 and 343-44. I have chosen toadopt many of his English equivalents, after reading their corresponding Tibetanterms and viewing the examples in Don grub rgyal’s book on mgur. I provide P.SØrensen and others’ Tibetan equivalents here so that the reader will know which ofthe concepts I use to explain metrics are recognized by Tibetan theorists.2It may seem that the actual length of a verse when sung would be directlyproportionate to the number of syllables that it contains. While surely there is arelation between the visual and audible lengths of a line, they are not necessarilydirectly proportionate. The current musical tradition employs all kinds of note valuesin its melismas, in which some beats are heavily ornamented and others are not. Thismakes the actual duration of some beats much longer than others. In the presentsection, when I speak of a line’s length, I will be referring to its number of syllables."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"METRICS113(tsheg bar do mi mnyam pa).3 In both cases, syllables in a line aresubdivided into smaller units.

Western analysts of Tibetan poetry have developed their ownvocabulary in order to explain what makes up a subdivision, whichthey call a “foot” (not to be confused with a Tibetan term for a lineof verse, rkang pa, which also means “foot”). These scholars agreethat there are two types of syllables. Some theorists, such as S.Beyer,6 make the distinction between stressed and unstressed. Others,such as P. SØrensen,7 call them strong and weak, in the sense ofbeing semantically strong and semantically weak.8 Here I shall adoptSØrensen’s terminology of strong and weak, since it is not clear towhat extent stresses were actually performed in the course of singingamgur. What constitutes a strong/stressed or a weak /unstressedbeat? Beyer provides a detailed explanation:Every word in classical Tibetan has a single primary stress thatfalls on the first syllable; bound forms (conjunctions,nominalizers, role particles, bound quantifiers) are thusconsidered unstressed, as are also ni and yang, unless the latteris the first word of the preposition; free quantifiers, numerals,and determiners may also be unstressed in a weak position.9Furthermore, each type has its predetermined position in a foot: eachfoot starts with a strong syllable, and the remaining syllables in thefoot (usually one or two) are weak. This describes the two types offeet that Western theorists have recognized to be in systematic use inTibetan poetry: the foot with two syllables and the one with three.10________5Don grub rgyal, Bod kyi mgur glu, 497.6Stephan Beyer, The Classical Tibetan Language (Albany: State University ofNew York Press, 1992), 408.7SØrensen,Divinity Secularized, 13.8SØrensen,Divinity Secularized, 13.9Beyer,The Classical Tibetan Language, 408. It should be noted that whether abeat is strong or weak is not a function of whether its syllable has a high or low tone.10This corresponds to examples Don grub rgyal gives of different subdivisions,yet I glean that he also recognizes the systematic use of the tetrasyllabic foot.

As my divisions indicate, the basic unit of most of the linesis a foot of two syllables (tsheg bar cha). Most Western theorists15have referred to this as a “trochee” or “trochaic foot.” J. Vekerdi hastaken issue with this terminology, because it implies not only that thesyllables are stressed and unstressed but also that their durations arelong and short, which is not the case in Tibetan verse:________14Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 67/ 61.15SØrensen, Beyer, Helffer and others."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN118There is no doubt that the shortness or length of syllables cannotplay any part in Tibetan versification, since classical Tibetandoes not distinguish between long and short vowels.16.....the term [trochaic] should be avoided because of its lack ofprecision: in versification based on stress it is inadvisable to usethe terminology of quantitative prosody.17Vekerdi suggests that rather than calling a two-syllable unit a“trochaic foot,” we should call it a “disyllabic foot.” Clearly the term“trochaic foot” is frequently used, and when we see it we need toremind ourselves that it does not insinuate a differentiation ofduration for the syllables. The term disyllabic foot is more accurateas it does not connote something which is absent in Tibetan verse.Five Syllables per Line3 + 2Only two of the mgur in Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s Mgur ’bum (.8%)have five syllables per line, and both use the same subdivision.According to Don grub rgyal, there are two possibilities for dividingfive syllables into groups, and he describes this particular one asfollows:h‹e-¤r-et#e-e#-x#-e*-fe(-f-en$f-fif-[^-N\u0002\u0004(c-d-[r-! el^e-f-ei#n-Vμ]-[^-Q\u0003(e-a-l#e-x#]-o*!.......18The subdivisions have three syllables and two syllables,respectively.Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s Mgur IV-3 and IV-7, which use this form,will be discussed in Chapter 8, because they are also examples ofmgur with stanzas of five lines, and a large part of one is closelyrelated to the other in language and style.

The meaning of the lineis not dependent on any translation of ni, though Stein and othershave translated it as “oui,” “oh oui,” “yes,” “ah yes,” and so forth.21 There is a major difference between the usage of niin most of thetexts traditionally ascribed to the Period of the Early Diffusion ofBuddhism, or snga dar, and the above usage of ni: the snga darverses in which ni appears usually have six syllables per line. In fact,every example of verse that Don grub rgyal ascribes to the snga darand that has a regular number of syllables per line is hexasyllabic,withni in third place. Nevertheless, there are some examples ofearlier texts that have a trisyllabic foot with ni followed by adisyllabic foot.

But first I will continue to examine aspects of hisstyle by turning to his use of stanza patterns."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTSTANZA PATTERNSNow that we have looked at Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s use of metrics, Iwill turn to another form of rhythm found in verse, stanza patterns.Like metrics, these also play a pivotal role in the structure of a mgurand in the formation of its character, since syntax and sentencelengths are dependent upon them. The notion of stanza (sho lo ka )clearly exists in Tibet.1 But in a Tibetan text, since lines of verse justfollow one another as they fit across the page, stanza patterns are notimmediately perceptible the way meters are. It is sometimes neces-sary to read a mgurcarefully in order to group the lines into stanzas,giving each stanza a distinct idea, and the groupings can be arbitrarywhen the stanza patterns are irregular. At other times there arerepetitions in corresponding places from stanza to stanza, or stanzaexternal repetition, that allow one to identify the stanza patternsdefinitively and quickly. The notion of stanza has not been dealt within detail by most Western theorists,2 exceptions being P. Poucha,who made an inquiry into stanza in Tibetan classical verse, and anumber of ethnomusicologists, who have studied stanzas in relationto popular song. Their interest is sparked by the frequent coexistenceof repetition or variation of a melody (and sometimes a sequence ofdance steps) with regular stanza lengths.3________1 Don grub rgyal makes frequent references to sho lo ka (Tibetanized version ofSanskrit,Ÿloka). For instance, sho lo ka gcig la tshig rkang drug yod de...., “Thestanza which has six lines.....” See Bod kyi mgur glu, 433. In the course of hisdescription of mgur, he gives examples of stanzas with various numbers of lines.2 P. Poucha has gone to length to show examples of various numbers of syllablesper line in stanzas consisting of various numbers of lines (two through nine), and hasranked them according to frequency. See Pavel Poucha, “Le vers tibétain,” (1950):235 and “Le vers tibétain,” Archiv Orientální: Journal of the Czechoslovak OrientalInstitute 22.4 (1954): 578. The quatrain has received the most attention. For what some Western analystshave written about the quatrain, please see footnote 17.3 Giuseppe Tucci, comp., trans., Tibetan Folk Songs from Gyantse and WesternTibet, 2d ed., rev. and enl. (Ascona, Switzerland: Artibus Asiae, 1966), 16; PeterCrossley-Holland, “Form and Style in Tibetan Folksong Melody,” in Jahrbuch fürmusikalische Volks-und-Völker-Kunde, ed. Fritz Bose (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter &Co., 1967), 12; and Helffer, Les chants dans l’épopée tibétaine de Ge sar, 450-59."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT140 Many of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgur do not have a regularnumber of lines per sentence and are written in free form, in whichthere is no attempt to create a feeling of the pulse or rhythm in thenumber of lines from stanza to stanza. Besides those written in freeform, at least a quarter of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs have stanzasthat form patterns from five to two lines,4 and it is these that I willexamine below. The extent to which he used different stanza lengthsvaried greatly. He tended to use some of the forms in particularways, and what’s more, he sometimes chose a particular form for theparticular type of statement he wanted to make. In this chapter, I will show examples of poems whose stanzalengths form particular patterns, many of which exhibit stanzaexternal repetition. I shall emphasize the repetitions by formattingthem in bold, so that the reader can quickly see what syllables arerepeated in the same positions within stanzas, both in the Tibetanverses and their translations. Unusual stanza lengths are oftenaccompanied by other unique features of style and/or theme. Thisleads me to hypothesize that Skal ldan rgya mtsho was not onlyexperimenting with unusual stanza lengths but also with discreteways of writing songs. The variety of his mgur in this regard is yetanother demonstration of the enthusiasm and ability that enabled himto write in many styles.Stanzas of Four LinesAmong the mgur that I have identified as exhibiting some pattern ofstanza, over half of them have four lines, or predominately four lines,for every stanza. Mgur XI-15 is an example of such a mgur, and Iquote an excerpt from it below:[}#]-t]-R#-D\u0002-f-nrn-‰Xn-n$! !x#[-y*n-W#-[[-an-f#-dNø*]-ac! !________4 It is beyond the scope of my book to provide exact percentages of his songsthat are written in these respective ways, since it would involve a careful reading ofevery song in the Mgur ’bum."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"STANZA PATTERNS141dX#]-c\u0002dn-[r-x(]-o]-c*-d-[*! !n-d(]-]#-f*[-az#-v(-p(e-5z[}! ![v-zdX(c-R#-f#-v$n-p(d-[^n-z[#c! ![f-y(n-W#n-NI#r-a(-f#-v*]-a! !c#]-y*]-R#-E\u0002#r-n(r-h·r-a-’fn! !ve-Nø(r-[^-cr-x$v-zeC(-[r-zz[}! !6etc.The hope of blessings and qualitiesWithout relying with the faith of beliefOn a benevolent lama and the BuddhaIs like a crop which has no seeds.Not receiving the essence through the holy religionIn this time of obtaining a human body of leisure supportIs like merchants who had gone to an island of jewelsGoing [back] to their homeland empty-handed.etc.In the above verses, the sentences are all the same length and thefinite verb ’dra, “to be like,” is repeated at the end of the fourth line.These consistencies complement the succession of discrete ideas,each involving a comparison, and further emphasize the four-linepulse. Like the example above, many of the mgur that have strict or nearstrict sentence lengths of four lines have some repetition from stanzato stanza. This may range from the repetition of a word or words incorresponding lines to the repetition of whole lines. Mgur VII-3shows more extensive repetition than the example above, itsrepetition involving three lines for every stanza:N ́(f-a-w(-d(-N“([-nn! !c#-n$v-dCe-s$e-Nø(r-a! !________5thog AB; tog CD.6 Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 271/ 240."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT142[*r-nr-dC-dX#n-zsC(e-az#! !h$v-z[#n-N‘r-d-Nœ\u0001(-d! !N ́(f-a-w(-d(-zye-7n! !x#[-z(r-Når-V ̈(rn-ifn-[ez! ![*r-nr-c#-[ ̊en-’fn-W#n8! !d;$r-dnn-N‘r-d-Nœ\u0001(-d! !9etc.Because the sites where I, the one in contemplation,dwell,Empty caves in mountains,These days have been deprivedBecause of the marmots and rats—Oh sorrow!Because the sites which I, the one in contemplation, tread,Engaging, cheerful grassy meadows,These days have been taken overBy the wild animals—Oh sorrow!etc.Such extensive repetition continues throughout the poem, and furtheremphasizes the regularity of four-line units, each expressing someloss Skal ldan rgya mtsho notices about his retreats and how he feelsabout it. Listening to a song like this, once one recognizes what is thesame from stanza to stanza, what is different seems more dramatic.And the way a singer fills in the blank spots, while still maintainingthe stanzaic framework and meter and expressing somethingmeaningful, often ad libbing, adds great charm to a mgur. Interestingly, from among the five forms of Ladakhi songs that A.H. Francke collected towards the turn of the twentieth century inLadakh, it is the dance songs that have patterns of repetition, whichhe calls “parallelism” or “rhyme of sentence” and describes as “twoor more sentences .....constructed accordingly, and in the________7’chag CD; chags A; ’chags B.8kyis ABC; tshogs D.9 Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 139-40/ 123-24."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"STANZA PATTERNS143corresponding places different words are inserted.”10 This is exactlythe way in which Skal ldan rgya mtsho uses repetition. Such repetition also occurs plentifully in the la gzhas, or mountainsongs of eastern Tibet. Here is just one example, with the words thatare repeated from stanza to stanza formatted in bold:fwc-Vμ-wr-en*c-sC^-a[-‰X]-tt]! ![*z#-]r-]-Vμ-Nœ^-Ø*]-en$f-ddl^en! !eC ̊-fr-f-nn*fn-Ì*-u*-Nœ\u0002#[-b(e !y(n-nrn-‰Xn-dNø]-a-xc-[c-bb(e !N\u0001ç-c*-v$-en*c-R#-e^r-11b#r-tt]! ![*z#-]r-v-f-nC^-el#n-zj‹]-ddl^en! !f-nC^-x#-nn*fn-Ì*-u*-Nœ\u0002#[-b(e ![qc-z(-f-‰X^]-y[-f*[-ac-bb(e !12We already discussed la gzhas in Chapter 7, where I hypothesizedthat a meter that Skal ldan rgya mtsho uses frequently (1 + 2 + 2 + 3,precisely the meter here) may have connections with the folksongs inhis area. Mgur VII-5 is an example in which the last two lines are repeatedin full:________10 Francke identifies songs that have this kind of repetition as dance songs, whichhe says are essentially “unsophisticated” songs that can have either religious or laythemes, and are sung in the local dialect. He gives six examples of them: numbers 3,4, 6, 7, 8 and 10. See A. H. Francke, Ladakhi Songs (Leh: 1899), 12-31. The importance of the repetition of syllables in the same positions within stanzasin Tibetan verse seems to have been overlooked by almost all other Western writers.L. S. Savitsky writes of its importance in his article “Secular Lyrical Poetry in Tibet:Works of Tsangjang-jamtsho (1683–1706),” in Proceedings of the Csoma de KorösMemorial Symposium, ed. Louis Ligeti (Budapest: Akadémiai Kiadó, 1978), 407.(Henceforth referred to as “Secular Lyrical Poetry in Tibet.”) Yet he does not dealwith repetition from stanza to stanza, as each quatrain of the Sixth Dalai Lamastands by itself. P. van Heurck’s treatment of repetition is also confined torepetitions within a single stanza, as he is also analyzing the poems of the SixthDalai Lama. See Philippe van Heurck, Chantsattribués à Tsang Yang Gyatso,sixième Dalai Lama (Rikon-Zürich: Tibet-Institut, 1984).11 This may be a misprint for gur, according to the Rong bo scholar Blo bzangchos grags.12 Spen pa Chos grags, comp., Sde dge’i dmangs glu (Chengdu: Si khron mi rigsdpe skrun khang, 1986), 6."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT144N®(]-D\u0002-f-dl^en--[^n-[[-a-f*[! ![-[[-a-Nœ\u0003*n-hh°-D\u0002-f-13dX(]! ![*-ei#n-q-zj·f-az#-[^n-f-dX^r-! !d[e-z[#-c$-f#-N“([-c#-v-zeC( !N®(]-y(n-f#-b*n--[^n-ifn-v*]-z[([! ![-[f-y(n-b*n-hh°-ifn-v*]-dË*[! ![*-ei#n-q-zj·f-az#-[^n-f-dX^r-! !d[e-z[#-c$-f#-N“([-c#-v-zeC( !14etc.Before, when the lama lived, [I] had no faith.Now at the time that faith has been born, a lama hasnot appeared.The time of those two coming together has not occurred.I won’t stay here.

In the example cited above, the repetition of full lines comes at theend of each stanza. While this format is more frequent, in some casesthe repeated line comes at the beginning of each stanza. Mgur IV-1c,which I discussed in Chapter 6, is an example of this. In the segmentI quote below, bees are contesting what Skal ldan rgya mtsho said ofthem (that their human speech was a bad omen).

None of these ex-amples uses the popular classical Tibetan meters, and their subjectmatter seems informal. The la gzhas, or mountain songs, themselvesare in quatrains and often employ stanza external repetition. I havealready remarked on the metric correspondences between the lagzhas and Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgur.16 This leads me to________15 Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 66/ 60.16 It is well known that a particular type of group of folksongs, the gzhas (to bedistinguished from the la gzhas), consists of quatrains. See Geoffrey Samuel, “Songsof Lhasa,” Ethnomusicology (1976): 418; Melvyn Goldstein, “Lhasa Street Songs:Political and Social Satire in Traditional Tibet,” The Tibet Journal 7, nos. 1-2"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT146hypothesize that the likely influence on Skal ldan rgya mtsho’swriting of the verses above was popular song. But the quatrain has also been the most frequently used stanzaform in classical Tibetan verse,17 where it often has a meter ofseveral trochaic feet followed by one more beat (such as 2 + 2 + 3).18Skal ldan rgya mtsho employed the quatrain in eulogies he wrote forhis lineage and for his main teachers. These include the openinghomage of the Mgur ’bum, and eulogies to Tsong kha pa, Pa ̊chenthams cad mkyen pa (the first Pa ̊chen Lama), Mkhas grub Bstan padar rgyas (one of his main teachers at Dga’ ldan monastery), andChos pa Rin po che and his past lives. These are usually in thepopular classical nine-syllable meter (2 + 2 + 2 + 3). Judging fromthis list of homages, Skal ldan rgya mtsho felt that the quatrain usedwith a classical meter was the correct form to choose when hewanted to express respect toward lamas in a conservative way.19________(1982): 56 (henceforth referred to as “Lhasa Street Songs”); and Marion H. Duncan,Love Songs and Proverbs of Tibet (London: The Mitre Press, 1961), 12. The gzhas,however, always has the particular meter of 2 + 2 + 2, and since a very lowpercentage of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgur that are in quatrains use this meter, Idiscount any significant connection between the gzhas and his mgur.17 Poucha, “Le vers tibétain” (1950): 192, 229.P. SØrensen states the following in Divinity Secularized, 13-14:....in almost all treatises and works translated into canonical Tibetan fromSanskrit and Chinese the four-lined (tshig rkang bzhi) iso-syllabic stanzaor strophe (the Tibetan Ÿloka ) became the fixed norm in versification(tshigs bcad). The most prevalent metrical form was the hepta-syllabic intheŸloka-quatrians..... This pattern quickly became the most dominantform and was invariably found in most of the classical and canonicalversified literature. The Tibetan translation of the popular aphoristic andproverbial literature, predominantly rendered in seven-syllable....... andnine-syllable meter....., consisted of three (resp. four) and a half feet.....The popularity [of versified moral precepts]....which gained a firmfooting in the wake of the writings of Sa skya Pa ̊ ̃ita and his school,exerted a tremendous influence on the later folksong trading bysupplying it with a storehouse of proverbs and worldly adages. According to R. A. Stein, the model for the form rendered so popular through Saskya Pa ̊ ̃ita’s maxims in Tibet (quatrains of seven syllables per line) was a Tibetantranslation of a collection of quatrains by N›g›rjuna (Shes rab sdong bu:Prajnadanda). See Stein, Tibetan Civilization, 268-70.18 While the quatrain with seven syllables per line was the most popular of all,the quatrain with nine syllables per line was second in popularity.19 Some of these have repetition as well, often in the entire last line of eachquatrain, which may read something like, “I beseech.... Please bless me.” See MgurI-5, 10-12/ 9-11."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"STANZA PATTERNS147Hence, Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s use of the quatrain was motivatedsometimes by folk song and sometimes by classical verse. The same cannot be said of the influences on Skal ldan rgyamtsho’s use of other stanza groups. Examples of less-frequently usedtwo, three and five up through nine lines per stanza are found inclassical verse, where they usually have the same meters as thequatrain.20 But when Skal ldan rgya mtsho uses the two-line, three-line and five-line stanzas (exemplified below), he almost never usesthem with the characteristic metric patterns of classical verse. Thisleads me to hypothesize that his use of those stanza forms is motiv-ated by popular song. As noted above, only a portion of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgurthat have regular stanza patterns use the four-line stanza form,which, furthermore, is not exclusively associated with classicalTibetan verse since it is also frequently found in folk songs.Therefore, with regard to stanza patterns (and their interaction withmetrics), the vast majority of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgurin theMgur ’bum are not written in the classical Tibetan style.Stanzas of Five LinesThere are several mgur in the Mgur ’bum that contain stanzas ofstrictly five lines each. From among these, IV-3 and IV-7 are closelyrelated in that they share whole lines, variations on lines, andmetaphors.21 Besides having stanza lengths and words and evenwhole lines in common, they are the only two songs in this meter (3+ 2) in the entire Mgur ’bum, as we learned in Chapter 7. The factthat Skal ldan rgya mtsho wrote two songs (and only two songs) thatshare these elements suggests that he was experimenting with aparticular form. At this point, I cannot hypothesize about the type ofpopular song that influenced him. I quote here an excerpt from MgurIV-3:________20 Poucha, “Le vers tibétain” (1950): 192-215.21 For another example of a mgur made up of five-line stanzas, see Mgur I-8, 14-16/ 12-14, which is a eulogy to the Dga’ ldan lama Mdo rgyud rgya mtsho and hispast lives."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT148,(±-n\u0006-Nø#![e*-N\u0002\u0005(c-RR#-f*-o(e ![[-e^n-WW#-y$-d(n! !xr-xr-[^-dc\u0004]-WWr-! !’f-ex*r-ee#-n*c-dnn! ![dr-f*[-[^-dt(f-xx! ![e*-n*fn-WW#-fX^-e^! !v$r-c#en-WW#-[}([-W#n! !xr-xr-[^-dNœ\u0005rn-WWr-! ![q(c-N ́ç#d-WW#-d-f(n! ![dr-f*[-[^-\u0003*c-xx! !22etc.O ̇ sva sti.Although the flower of good behaviorWas watered again and againBythe river of faith and respect,[It] was helplessly vanquishedBy the hailstorm of laziness.

Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s use of metaphors will bediscussed in Chapter 10.

Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s use of interjections will bediscussed in Chapter 10. The appearance of the emphatic line final ya, repeated at the endof each stanza, is rare in the Mgur ’bum of Skal ldan rgya mtsho,where it is used in only four mgur, though repeatedly in those selectfew. It is interesting to note that three out of the four mgur in whichya appears are precisely those discussed above—Mgur IV-3, IV-7and IV-8—which use the five-line stanza. (Ya is also found in MgurVIII-24, which is highly related to Mgur IV-8 through the insertionof the same set of sounds into the songs, also discussed in Chapter10.) It seems that in most mgur in the Mgur ’bum that use stanzas offive lines, a variety of other oddities of style accompany this little-used stanza length. These oddities include a meter exclusively usedin this form, interjections of a certain set of sounds that begin thelines (of the mgur that use them, one is in this form and one is in thefour-line form), and the use of an interjection at the end of a line(three of the four mgur that use it appear in this form). Anomaliessuch as these that suggest that Skal ldan rgya mtsho is not onlyexperimenting with unusual stanza patterns themselves, butassociating a pattern with other distinctive features of style as well. Itdoes not seem coincidental that Skal ldan rgya mtsho chose the five-line form for some cases of unique expression among his songs.Stanzas of Three LinesIn the Mgur ’bum of Skal ldan rgya mtsho, there are also a few mgurmade up of stanzas of three lines. I quote an excerpt from Mgur IV-9, translated in full in the appendix, as an example of this form:,-f*-D\u0002-f-dNø*]-hh$v-z[#-v! !dX#]-c\u0002dn-[r(n-eC^d-[(]-v-mm-m! !‰Xv-dz#-dqz-v-VVø(n-[r-e(-x*! !,-f*-f#-h°-e;[-hh$v-z[#-v! !sX#-fc-d[*-zeC(z#-[(]-v-mm-m! !N“#e-t]-zy#-qc-VVø(n-[r-e(-x*! !"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"STANZA PATTERNS151,-f*-zy#-d[e-do^[-24h$v-z[#-v! !h°-nC(e-dØ]-az#-[(]-v-mm-m! !f#-fr-zy#-h$v-VVø(n-[r-e(-x*! !25etc.Oh my—this way of relying on a lamaFor the benefits of blessings and spiritual powers!

It isprobable that Skal ldan rgya mtsho is addressing himself in thishighly critical way. It is interesting to see that Skal ldan rgya mtsho uses the verbalendingye exclusively in the mgur cited above, IV-9, where it alwaysfollowsgo, to understand, and occurs thirteen times.27 Mgur V-11, also translated in full in the appendix, is another ex-ample of a mgur made up almost entirely of three-line sentences withrepetition:________24btud ACD; btul B.

As we saw in Chapter 7, a scant eleven of the songs of theMgur ’bum employ this number of beats per line, and use three setsof subdivisions: 2 + 2 + 3, 3 + 2 + 2, and 2 + 3. The mgur quotedabove is the only mgur that uses 2 + 3 + 2 extensively. Among the mgur of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s Mgur ’bum, MgurVII-17 above demonstrates unusual qualities such as an unusualmeter and an unusual, extensive use of the particle ni. This furtherdemonstrates my hypothesis that unusual stanza lengths are oftenaccompanied by other unique features of style and/or theme. Like the mgur in the Mgur ’bum that employ stanzas of five lines,those with stanzas of three lines are infrequent and oftenaccompanied by other unique features of style and/or theme, such asinterjections, Amdo dialect, heavy self-criticism, extensive use of theparticleni, and a very unusual meter. As in the case of mgur withstanzas of five lines, it seems that Skal ldan rgya mtsho chose thisform for cases of unusual expression among his songs.Stanzas of Two LinesExamples of mgur written exclusively with two-line stanzas are alsofew. We have already seen two of these in cycles of mgur that takethe form of conversations with animals. Mgur cycle IV-1, in whichSkal ldan rgya mtsho has a conversation with and receives teachingsfrom bees, is translated in full in the appendix.

The usage of two-line stanzas in the Mgur ’bum varies. The sub-ject of the mgur is often gently given advice (as in many mgur). Itseems that Skal ldan rgya mtsho did not accompany this stanza pat-tern with many of the unusual features that appeared regularly in hismgur of five or of three-line stanzas.Mgur with Exceptionally Long SentencesThe longest sentence in the Mgur ’bum, one of eighty-four lines, is inMgur III-8, and is a eulogy to Chos pa Rin po che.

Ornate poetry (k›vya,snyan ngag) is poetry composed inaccordance with the K›vy›darŸa and other treatises of k›vya. We can understand what ornate poetry is in Tibet by situating it ina larger context. Let us look at the following quote by R. Jacksonagain, which distinguishes three genres of Tibetan poetry—glu,mgurandsnyan ngag3—this time focusing on what he says about snyanngag:...glu,mgur and snyan ngag (along with the Ge sar epiccorpus) together roughly comprise the Tibetan poetic canon.Glu, which remains in Tibetan as a general term for “song,” isthe earliest, most indigenous, most secular, and most orallyand musically oriented of the genres. mGur, which originallywas either a synonym or a subdivision of glu, came eventuallyto denote a more Buddhistic type of “song,” and might be________1 Leonard W.

Glu,mgur and snyan ngag are three distinguishableyet interrelated genres. Unlike the other two, snyan ngag is alwaysinfluenced by Indian ornate poetry, is never sung, and does notappear in Tibet until the thirteenth century. Once the study of the K›vy›darŸa took hold in Tibet, its influencethere was huge, as L. van der Kuijp explains:The enormous impact of Da ̊ ̃in’s text on Tibetan letters ingeneral is also apparent from the fourteenth century onward,where one can discern a conscious use of its poeticfigures—these fall into two classes: poetic figures based onsemantic considerations aphonologicalones—in virtually every literary genre, whether it be in eulogies,biographies, chronicles or dissertations on medicine, astrologyand so on.5Da ̊ ̃in classified his poetic figures into two main types: those thatinvolved semantic considerations and those that involved phono-logical ones. These began to appear in a conscious way in everyliterary genre in Tibet not long after the translation of theK›vy›darŸa into Tibetan in the thirteenth century. Da ̊ ̃in’s text also influenced other poetic genres—mgur, and, to alesser extent, glu—as Jackson explains:...the theory and practice of snyan ngag influenced thecomposition of mgur—and perhaps even glu—from thethirteenth century onward. However, its influence upon thetradition of glu was slight, and among mgur composers itinfluenced most those who received a classical monasticeducation, and least those whose sphere was less academic.________4 Jackson, “‘Poetry’ in Tibet,” 369-70.5 van der Kuijp, “Tibetan Belles-Lettres: The Influence of Da ̊ ̃in andK ̋emendra,” 397."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE164sNyan ngag itself was composed almost entirely by those withan academic background—but as the monastic university systemtook hold in Tibet, this came to include many of the nation’sgreatest thinkers and, for that matter, saints.6In summary, snyan ngag is ornamental poetry written in accordancewith the K›vy›darŸa. When its influence appears in mgur, it is likelyto be found in those by song-writers who had a monastic education. Skal ldan rgya mtsho is an example of someone who underwent arigorous traditional monastic education in Dga’ ldan for elevenyears, during which time he was surely exposed to the principles ofornate poetry, and later wrote mgur. This sets him apart from manycomposers of mgur related to the Bka’ brgyud pa school—such asMi la ras pa—whom we normally associate with mgur, who were noteducated in monasteries. Skal ldan rgya mtsho refers to snyan dngags7 at various times inhis songs,8 and in various colophons to songs in his Mgur ’bum, he isreferred to as“snyan dngags mkhan,”9 in the sense of “poet” ratherthan in direct reference to Da ̊ ̃in’ssnyan ngag. Not surprisingly, themajority of references to snyan dngags in the Mgur ’bum are made inrelation to Tsong kha pa, and yet another reference is made in aeulogy to Bstan pa dar rgyas, a teacher Skal ldan rgya mtsho reliedon for mainstream studies of Madhyamaka at Dga’ ldan monasteryfor seven years.10 It appears that Skal ldan rgya mtsho aspired to usewhat he called “poetry” in eulogies and other songs honoring someof those with whom he had a most formal and conservativerelationship.

These two major types ofmeter have various subkinds, and are defined by the number and position ofsyllables, whether the syllables are light or heavy (v ̧tta) or are determined by thenumber of “sound instants” (j›ti). Eppling explains these types of meters in “ACalculus of Creative Expression,” 81-85. The applicability and inapplicability of Indian metrics to Tibetan verse will beaddressed in my discussion below on the poetic figure of yamaka (repetitioninvolving groups of letters). But here I will quickly deal with the concept of weight,by quoting Eppling’s definitions of light and heavy vowels:...whether “light”/ laghu, where the vowel is short and not followed bymore than one consonant; or “heavy”/ guru, where the vowel is long, orif short it is followed by two or more consonants (whether in anotherword or not) or if the syllable contains either an anusv›ra or visarga."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE166Features creating the beauty of k›vyaare called ala ̇k›ras.Even today they are being postulated—Who could completely describe them?14There are an unlimited number of poetic figures, it seems.

It should be mentioned here that not all poetic figures found inmgur exhibit an influence from Da ̊ ̃in. Some of Skal ldan rgyamtsho’s other poetic figures cannot be linked exclusively to theprinciples of ornate poetry. Others have no connection with anythingin the K›vy›darŸa. Before going on to indigenous types of figures inChapter 10, I will give examples of five figures dealing with repeti-tion of syllables (yamaka), one example involving phonemic restric-tion (niyama), and one example of a riddle (prahelik›), that are clear-ly the most influenced by Da ̊ ̃in’s treatise.

Instead, most are repetitions of single verb stems or of an ad-jective, done for the purpose of emphasizing the good quality of theactions taken.30 The repetition of the adjective, gyong ba, intensifiesits sense.31 Hence, first, the subject of the excerpt above had to strivewell to make progress, since he was so very stubborn. But finally,now that he practices so well, the fruits of his endeavors are greaterand greater.

His example has eight syllables per quarter. In theedition above, no divisions are delineated between the first andsecond, and between the third and fourth quarters. Hence there aresixteen syllables per line. The fact that the first rahitaifalls on theninth syllable of the second line means that it comes at the beginningof the fourth quarter, and is therefore a contiguous initial yamaka inthe fourth foot. Again, it must be emphasized that in the application of Da ̊ ̃in’svarious subcategories of yamaka in mgur (with its own varieties ofstanza patterns, sentence lengths and metrics), liberties may be takenand adaptations are necessary.

Don grub rgyal may have reason to take his not-so-few comradesto task for keeping their sights so focused on the K›vy›darŸa inorder to judge the legitimacy of Tibetan poetry. Is this what Da ̊ ̃inhimself would have proposed? Here I will remind the reader of thesecond half of Da ̊ ̃in’s verse that completes his definition of poeticfigures (ala ̇k›ras):Even today [poetic figures, ala ̇k›ras] are being postulated—Who could completely describe them?3Although Da ̊ ̃in describes in painstaking detail the many poeticfigures (and their many subtypes) that he deals with in theK›vy›darŸa, he quickly acknowledges that there will always bemore. Don grub rgyal himself has postulated a number of new poeticfigures that he found in Tibetan poetry. This puts him even more inaccord with Da ̊ ̃in’s visions than those comrades he finds faultwith, who evaluate Tibetan poetic figures on the basis of whetherthey were written in accordance with Da ̊ ̃in’s text.

SIMILESThere are a variety of similes in Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgur. Onemay wonder whether some have been influenced by the K›vy›darŸaor whether they are truly indigenous. Sometimes it seems that theremay be an overlap of influence, and it is not clear whether Skal ldanrgya mtsho is using a particular form because of Da ̊ ̃in’s influenceor is acting independently. Let us look at some of the similes mostoften used by Skal ldan rgya mtsho, after which I will discuss thequestion of their origin.The similes that Skal ldan rgya mtsho uses that are indicated by suchwords as bzhin, ltar, lta bu, ’dra and mnyam frequently draw onsimple images from everyday life as analogies.

First, let usconsider the K›vy›darŸa. Anyone who has read this treatise on snyanngag cannot help but be in awe of Da ̊ ̃in’s explanation of his thirty-two types of upam›, sometimes translated as simile. Upam› is thefirst figure that Da ̊ ̃in describes in the major category of his secondchapter: semantic figures that involve the embellishment offigurative or indirect speech. His discussion of the thirty-two typesfills fifty-one verses. Da ̊ ̃in’s definition of upam› is as follows:Where - - variously - - similarityis clearly seen - -There is the ala ̇k›ra called Upam›.Its scope will not be described.52 A reading of Da ̊ ̃in’s many types of upam› will quickly revealthat his poetic figures under that general heading encompass theWestern notion of simile, but include many other notions as well.Most revealing are his particles, words and expressions that indicatesimilarity in upam›s, listed in verses II.57 to 65. He heads the listwith a number of words that can be translated as “like,” and________51 Skal ldan, Mgur ’bum, 271/ 240.52 Da ̊ ̃in, II.14, translated by Eppling in A Calculus of Creative Expression,408."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"INDIGENOUS TIBETAN POETIC FIGURES203“similar,” indicating to me (as his examples also do) that his maininterpretation of upam› is precisely what we term simile in the West.But as his list progresses, we see that other particles and words thathe identifies as indicating similarity in upam›s, such as “on theopposite side,” “enemy,” “opponent,” “reflection,” “blame,”“torment”; and phrases such as “He robs his beauty” and “Heassociates with him,” take us far from our familiar notion of thesimile.53 Hence, I follow Eppling’s guidance in arguing againsttranslatingupam› as “simile” (as well as against translating rÒpakaas “metaphor”) because some aspects of upam› do not have thecorrespondences typical of the Western concept of simile. More-over, in the West the simile is a limited subspecies of metaphor,while in India the reverse is true: upam› is the central figure, andrÒpaka is defined as a subtype of it.54 One of the thirty-two types is called “Upam› of Objects.” Da ̊ ̃indefines it and gives examples in Verse II.16:Your face is like a lotusYour eyes like lilies - -Where the common attribute is just impliedThis is the Upam› of Objects.55This is one of the types of upam› that we can truly refer to as“simile.” And this is the only type of upam› that Skal ldan rgyamtsho uses in any systematic way in his songs. As we have seenabove, he draws comparisons between nouns, and his similes areindicated by such words as bzhin,ltar,lta bu,’dra and mnyam. Butin this regard, has he been influenced by the K›vy›darŸa? Don grub rgyal is right to point out that the simile (dpe rgyan) hasbeen used extensively in Tibet:________53 These examples have been taken from Da ̊ ̃in’s list, in Verses II.57-65,translated by Eppling, A Calculus of Creative Expression, 575-83.54 Eppling, A Calculus of Creative Expression, 409-10.55 Da ̊ ̃in, II.16, translated by Eppling in A Calculus of Creative Expression,468."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN204N®(]-dX(]-d([-W#-fwn-a-[e-e#n-dÌfn-az#-fe^c-E\u0003^-[r-! d([-c#en-[frn-„([-W#-eln-h‹e-’fn-v-l#d-zu$e-dXn-]!

As mentioned, I concede that the way Skal ldan rgya mtsho usesthe simile is consistent with the way one type of upam› is used inornate poetry. But that kind of simile was already used in Tibet longbefore the thirteenth century translation of the K›vy›darŸa, as thefollowing excerpts of prose and poetry from the Dunhuangdocuments will show.

Though they were not written down until recently, itis known that they have much less Indian influence than mgur.61 Taking into account the prevalence of the very form of simile thatSkal ldan rgya mtsho uses in both Dunhuang material and folksongs,and the fact that he uses only one out of the thirty-two types ofupam› explained in the K›vy›darŸa in any type of systematic way, Iconclude that in the case of similes, Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s influencecame from indigenous Tibetan usage.________59 P 1287.0516, quoted in Imaeda and Takeuchi, Choix de documents tibétains,37.

Also we have areference to a thief.Finally, I would like to address the origin of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’sstyle of metaphors. As mentioned above, Westerners frequentlytranslate the Sanskrit rÒpaka by “metaphor.” Let us look at howDa ̊ ̃in defines rÒpaka:Upam› itself—with difference obscured—is called RÒpaka.For example:Arm-creeper Hand-lotus Foot-petal.85Da ̊ ̃in derives the rÒpaka from the upam›. With the elimination ofthe word, particle or expression that expressed similarity in upam›,the absolute identity of the two things being compared is established.I am taken by the complexity of the twenty-one types of rÒpaka thatDa ̊ ̃in describes in verses II.67-96.86 Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s poeticfigures do not seem to be derived from any of Da ̊ ̃in’s subtypes ofrÒpaka. Don grub rgyal believes that rÒpaka (gzugs can) have animportant place in mgur, but only if they are eloquent and easilyunderstood:e;$en-t]-R#-‰X]-xr-fe^c-E\u0003^-v-i*-dc-fw(-dz#-‰X]-l#e-c*[! x#]-]-xr-!N\u0002\u0004c-dz#-e;$en-t]-R#-‰X]-]#-w-t$r-;[-[f-a-[r-! e(-xr-[*-z[}-f#-d[*-dn-fe^c-E\u0003^-v-i*-dc-fe(-87d-l#e-f#]!88Metaphors are also poetic figures that are very much needed inmgur.

The existence of structural parallelisms in Mi la ras pa is alsoattested by Jackson, who remarks on the existence of parallelism in glu and in Mi laras pa: Mi la ras pa combined items from ancient glu (“imagery, structural parallel-ism and expressive directness”) with “Buddhist themes and Indian-inspired metricalschemes.” See Jackson, “‘Poetry’ in Tibet,” 373."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN220On the branches of the oak trees,Agile monkeys swing and leap;They are not afraid of falling—Such is the wild monkey’s way.Under the leafy canopy of the dense wood,The striped tiger roams and swiftly runs,Not because of fear or worry—This shows her haughty pride,And is the mighty tiger’s way.In the wood on Singa Mountain,I, Milarepa, meditate on Voidness,Not because I fear to lose my understanding—Constant meditation is the yogi’s way.101A sequence of animals similar to the one above is common in the Gesar epic.

Clearly, the type of parallelism exemplified above in the mgur ofboth Skal ldan rgya mtsho and Mi la ras pa is much more complexthan Da ̊ ̃in’s. Their type, found frequently in mgur in Tibet, canhave any number of parts that all modify the last stanza, whereasDa ̊ ̃in’s only has two parts, the second modifying the first.105(Nearly all of Da ̊ ̃in’s examples of poetic figures are those that fallwithin the compass of a single stanza, this one included.) AlthoughSkal ldan rgya mtsho’s figure certainly has similarities to Da ̊ ̃in’s,it would be wrong to assume that his parallelisms were inspired bytheK›vy›darŸa. A variety of authors have remarked on the parallelisms inDunhuang manuscripts, notably Savitsky, who writes of“psychological and rhythmical syntactical parallelisms” (and“phonetic parallelisms”) in those documents.106 SØrensen also re-marks on the existence of parallelism in poetry commonly attributedto the Early Diffusion of Buddhism in Tibet.107 In addition, Jacksonalso writes about the existence of parallelism in songs (glu), as wehave seen, which represent “the earliest, most indigenous, most secu-lar, and most orally and musically oriented of the genres [of Tibetanpoetry].”108 All of this adds up to the fact that parallelism is an indigenousTibetan poetic figure.

SØrensen also remarks that parallelism(including antithesis) is frequently found in the poems of the Sixth Dalai Lama. Hepoints out that parallelism is “most regularly employed in order to illustrate,compare, contrast or in order to enforce a concrete object or a statement.” Thesimiles or allusions can be in the first or the second couplet of a stanza.

I have also discussed the structural functions of the interjectionswithin the excerpts. The vast majority of interjections come at thebeginning of a line. A couple of them (kye,ha ha and a li) are used atboth the beginnings and ends of lines. Several of the interjections fillwhole lines themselves. The majority of interjections come at thebeginning of a sentence. A li and kye come both at the beginning andend of a sentence. Ha ha sometimes interrupts a sentence after arelative clause. A la la, which often introduces a sentence, can alsobe found to come between relative and main clauses. Interjectionsthat fill whole lines come after the sentence, and finish off the stanza. The four interjections that Skal ldan rgya mtsho used as a set comeat the beginning of the lines, and are used exclusively in those twomgur, with one exception of he he appearing once elsewhere. ’O ’o,kho re and he he all introduce sentences.

As we saw in his choices of stanza patternsand metrics, Skal ldan rgya mtsho has exhibited skill in the styles ofboth categories, reflecting his multiple areas of expertise and interest.But again, my examples of the indigenous poetic figures in his mgurfar outweigh the classical ones.

Considered the firstof their most important reincarnation lineage, he remains one of themost revered of all lamas in the history of Reb gong. Virtually everynomad and farmer has a copy of his Mgur ’bum in his house or tentand respects it as a sacred object, much as a religious statue or thangka painting, whether he has the reading skill to understand all thepoems or not. Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s Collected Writings, includingtheMgur ’bum, play a part in the curriculum of Rong bo monastery,Rong bo Bkra shis ’khyil monastery, and other Dge lugs pamonasteries influenced by him in Amdo. The monk-scholars I havemet in such monasteries consider reading the Mgur ’bum sufficientfor receiving instruction and inspiration from his songs. But the surprising thing is that, besides the simple reverence to thetext as a religious object and the monk-scholars’ custom of readingand studying Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgur, there exists anothertradition of specially designated monks and lay soloists who actuallysing these mgur regularly in specific ritual contexts. This is veryunusual, in spite of the fact that mgur were intended to be sung, sincethe tradition of the singing of most other siddhas’ mgur has died out. One of the few exceptions is Mi la ras pa’s mgur, which are stillsung in a few spots today. However, there is no standardization ofperformance style. Several plausible recordings produced by S.Beyer are sung by a ’Brug pa monk or monks; and a Khams papainter and sculptor, singing simple pentatonic melodies with onlyshort melismas.1 Another pair of songs whose style shows a closerelationship to folk music were recorded by J.

Other recordings, notconcerned with authenticity, indicate that Tibetans feel they canperform Mi la ras pa’s songs in just about any way that strikes theirfancy. Such recordings range from Bla brang Bkra shis ’khyilmonks’ performance in an animated, classical style accompanied byinstruments in a swinging rhythm,3 to the performances by othermonks or nuns using lots of sustained notes in extremely slowtempos.4 The latter recordings show no discernable influence fromfolk songs, and hence no relationship to the way Mi la ras pa himselfmay have sung his mgur. By contrast, not only is there a general standardization of howSkal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs are to be performed today,5 but the waythey are sung shows a strong relationship to folk songs. In particular,major aspects of their form are like those of folk songs sung inEastern Tibet, and hence may well resemble how Skal ldan rgyamtsho sang his songs in the seventeenth century.

Themore experienced monks take the further step of singing several cycles also in thatway, and then speeding up by blending into fragments of the melody a chantingstyle that improvises on that melody’s cells. My accompanying CD illustrates thesepoints. Hear, for example, tracks 4 and 5 (which illustrate two lay performances ofthe same melody); tracks 7, 8, and 11 (performances by a lay soloist, a young monkand an experienced monk of a given melody); and tracks 9 and 10 (performances ofa young and an experienced monk of yet another melody)."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF SINGING THE MGUR TODAY249investigation into the performance of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgurhas unique importance for the study of the genre itself. In this coda, Iwill focus on this very alive ritual tradition of singing Skal ldan rgyamtsho’smgur from the point of view of both its musical and ritualcontexts.The Musical ContextThe general form in which Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgur are sungtoday is antiphonal, with a soloist singing several lines from themgur and with a chorus singing O ̇ m› ̊i padme [hÒ ̇]6 after him.The chorus is often quite large, and can number from one hundredand fifty to seven hundred villagers. The soloist and chorus go backand forth singing their parts, until an entire mgur is completed. Theprocess is slow, and it may take thirty minutes for a song of sixty-four lines to be performed. The soloist has over eighteen highlycomplex melodies from which to chose one appropriate for his linesfor a certain mgur. The chorus must then respond to him with aprescribed matching melody of an extremely simplified contourconsisting mainly of sustained notes from the same pitch collectionas the soloist’s. By oral tradition, this style of singing Skal ldan rgyamtsho’smgur antiphonally in a variety of melodies is said to dateback to Shes rab bkra shis, a mountain hermit disciple of Skal ldanrgya mtsho at Bkra shis ’khyil.7 But since Skal ldan rgya mtsho was sometimes alone in the soli-tary places where he sang his mgur, his original way of singing themcould not have necessitated a chorus. Moreover, Skal ldan rgyamtsho sang mgur largely to express religious teachings and his ex-perience of them, so he must have sung them in a way that broughtout the meaning of the words. Nowadays, the purpose of the singing________6 This is the mantra of AvalokiteŸvara.7 Bkra shis ’khyil monk Dpal ’byor, interview by author, Bkra shis ’khyil, notes,late summer, 2000.

There are aspectsof the present way of singing in which the form even obscures thewords.8 It seems probable that the purpose of singing the songsmoved from instruction (by Skal ldan rgya mtsho) to ritual (by latergenerations). And it is also likely that this shift was accompanied bya parallel movement away from a musical style that was generatedby the words and ostensibly more free—reflecting how Skal ldanrgya mtsho may have sung—to a more regimented one in terms ofprescribed melodies, stanza lengths, and the ubiquitous necessity of achorus. Skal ldan rgya mtsho created new words, whereas today thesingers read from a fixed text, a woodblock print of the Mgur ’bum,while singing. Although the musical form today shows stylization, interestingaspects of the original way of singing the mgur may be shiningthrough its trappings. I propose that certain melodic and rhythmiccharacteristics of the soloists may provide windows to the past,because they indicate an influence from folk songs. It is on thosemelodic and rhythmic aspects that I now want to focus.9________8 One indication that the music of the tradition as it is now known has beensuperimposed onto the words (rather than being generated by them) is that longmelismas sometimes fall on genitive or adverbial particles, or on an adjective thatprecedes a noun, breaking up the sense of the syntactic units. Extreme awkwardnesscomes about when singing the melody Gnyis go’u thung ngo, which has a caesuraamidst the beats of its first line, calling for the singing to come to a standstill nomatter what relation the following syllables have to the preceding ones. SingingMgur III-7 in this melody renders a full rest after Skal ldan, while the syllables rgyamtsho then begin the next phrase. Moreover, sometimes the melodic patterns form amusical stanza that does not match the textual stanza patterns in Skal ldan rgyamtsho’smgur, so lines that are not meant to be grouped together are sung together,such as the last lines of one sentence and the beginning lines of the next, as if theyformed a unit. Sometimes the monks even group the last lines of a mgur with thefirst lines of the next, and no one seems to blink an eye. For another example of the problem of fitting thought to meter, see Albert BatesLord, The Singer of Tales, 2d ed. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000): 21-22.9 It is beyond my scope here to comment on an antecedent for the role of thechorus as it is used today in Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs. All recordings ofantiphonal Tibetan music available to me show the equal importance of both parts,such as the play songs and work songs in which men and women sing back and forthto one another (though the men usually sing first). For examples of antiphonalTibetan folk music, hear, for example, Tibetan Folk and Minstrel Music, Lyrichordrecord LLST 7196, tracks 2, 6, 7, and 11; and Songs and Music of Tibet, FolkwaysRecords Album No. FE4486, side 1, bands 2-4; and side 2, bands 1, 2, 4, 6-8.

I will list names of themelodies below. Because these names belong exclusively to the oraltradition and because in the Amdo dialect one pronunciation can bespelled in many ways, I found no consensus on how to write thenames of some of these melodies.

Itis true that each village claims to have the “authentic version,” eachis slightly different from the others14 and there is no way to knowhow the songs were originally sung. However, a few generalizationsmay give us indications of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s original style. The melodies above and how they are performed share certaincharacteristics. They involve a pitch collection of between four andseven notes, with a range not much more than an octave and a halfand often quite less. Movement within the phrases is characterizedby sustained notes, some of which are decorated with quickmelismas in free rhythms.15 The lengths of the sustained notes aresometimes in stark contrast to the ornamental decorations. The linesfrequently fall into pairs. And they are sung with no instrumentalaccompaniment. I have placed examples on my accompanying CD.

On the far eastern side of the Tibetanplateau, valleys cut into the highlands and steep mountains are quiteclose to one another. There is an echoing effect, and frequently Iheard nomads singing out very clearly, although I could only see ablack dot—a yak—very far below. Skal ldan rgya mtsho may wellhave used the melodies of the nomad songs of his area to sing hisownmgur, in the long tradition that went back to the cary›gıti inIndia and its development in Tibet in the mgur attributed to Mar paand Mi la ras pa. In my chapter on metrics I pointed out that themeters he used most often are meters used in folk music, as we knowit. His style would have appealed to the mountain hermits that he wasteaching and the familiarity of his melodies would have comple-mented his instructions, the tunes already having been part of theirdaily lives.22________21 Contrafacta, or the setting of texts to pre-existent melodies, is very common inother ritual contexts as well. Examples are frequent from other cultures and times. Inthe West, contrafacta dates back to the fifteenth century, where, after 1450, itusually occurred as in the process above, namely a sacred text substituted a secularone. Contrafacta blended something new (a text) with something older (a melody),in order to give a sense of familiarity to the message imparted. See The New GroveDictionary of Music and Musicians, 2d. ed, ed. Stanley Sadie (New York: Grove’sDictionaries Inc., 2001). For examples of contrafacta in sacred Syrian Jewishhymns, see Kay Kaufman Shelemay, Let Jasmine Rain Down: Song andRemembrance among Syrian Jews (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press,1998).22 While the folk songs of Eastern Tibet are the major influence upon howsoloists sing Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs today, it is important to recognize thatthere are differences between the styles too. The soloists who sing Skal ldan rgyamtsho’s songs sing them in a much tamer, more reserved way than the singers onmost of the recordings I have heard of eastern Tibetan folk music, since themelodies used to sing Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs have fewer wide leaps, anarrower range, and gentle (irregular) beats. Something close to them can be heardin Temple Rituals and Public Ceremonies, in Tibetan Buddhist Rites from theMonasteries of Bhutan, vol. 4, tracks 6, 7 and 19, since the folk songs recorded onthese tracks have less wild leaps than those on the other recordings, and since theyemploy gentle beats. I would like to remind the reader that throughout this discussion, I am comparingonly the style of the soloists singing Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs to the style of folksongs. However, absent from all the recordings cited above is a chorus singingmantras in intermittent lines. This is another big difference between how the folksongs on the recordings are sung and how Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs are sungtoday."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"CODA256The Ritual ContextsThe soloists are specially designated, and the roles they playdetermine whether they should be lay people or monks. I shalldescribe the two systems separately, starting with the lay singers.This tradition is alive in each of the villages on the Tibetan plateau tothe west of the Reb gong valley some five hours’ walking distancefrom one to another: Khyung bo, Stong ces, Hor nag, A bog, Bodmo, Sngags sa and Mgron lung.23 Each of these villages has a specialhouse for singing the mgur, a ma ni khang. Several that I visitedwere quite elaborate, with statues and religious paintings decoratingtheir interiors, and doubled as the central places of worship in theirrespective villages. One of these, the ma ni khang in A bog, stoodout unmistakably as the most affluent and elaborate structure in thevillage, with its exquisitely carved wood facade and brick walls. Each of the seven aforementioned villages has its own resident laysinger who has the sole responsibility for performing whateverrituals are required in his village. The occasions upon which mgurshould be sung are well defined.

Rong bo dgon monks sing Mi la ras pa’s mgurin the village of Reb sa every year. Mi la ras pa’s songs have traditionally been sungin the village of Brag dkar as well, in a style that did not come out of Rong bo dgonbut rather from Sgo dmar in the Rong bo valley. But Brag dkar’s text of Mi la raspa’s songs was lost in 1958 with the destruction of the temple, and since the singershave been unwilling to sing from a modern edition, they are now awaiting theacquisition of a woodblock print in order to resume their tradition. Zhabs dkar’s mgur are still read to the east of the Reb gong valley when someonedies, in place of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. See Ricard, trans., The Life ofShabkar, xiii. They are also sung at times in the Rong bo Valley when someone dies,such as in Mkhar rtse rdzong.

Finally, forsome days in the winter before planting the crops, they sing in thema ni khang; and for some days in the summer before the harvest,they sing in the fields.24 The monks’ tradition of singing Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgurcenters around the summer solstice festival,25 which goes on forabout fifteen straight days on mountains adjacent to all but one of thevillages listed above. Only monks from a particular monastery, Rongbo dgon,26 are allowed to sing in this festival. In the case of thisfestival, the chorus is huge, made up of all the villagers present,numbering from one hundred and fifty up to as high as seven hun-dred. A huge tent called a sbra gur (felt tent) is set up in each placeto accommodate the ritual. The monk-singers sit in front of an altarand their abbot’s throne, against a backdrop of thang ka paintings ofSkal ldan rgya mtsho, Chos pa Rin po che, and other high lamas onthe back of the tent. In a semicircle around the monks sit the lay malevillagers, and behind them are the lay women. One monk will singhis solo lines from the Mgur ’bum for about an hour, with all thevillagers singing the intermittent choral parts. Then there will be abreak. The villagers go outside and enjoy tea, and the scene ischarming beyond words with the views of mountain ranges and val-leys and the traditional clothing of the people.

Since my objective has been to use the Mgur’bum to show Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s importance both as adistinctive figure in religious history and as an author, I haveprovided a comprehensive overview of his collection of mgur, bothfrom the viewpoint of the autobiographical and biographical materialit contains and from the point of view of form. His Mgur ’bum is a collection of two hundred and forty-twosongs. The core of the collection goes back to at least 1707. The firstwoodblock printing of the entire Mgur ’bum as we know it today wasmade in 1756. I have created a critical edition from the four extantversions, one of which is the 1756 woodblock edition, upon which Ihave based my translations of his songs. Various scholars have already noted that the genre of mgur standsout from most other forms of Tibetan literature for its startlingly andunusually sincere descriptions of inner thoughts, feelings andexperiential knowledge. I have found this to be true of the collectionof Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgur, which contains invaluableautobiographical material and information on his surroundings andhis way of life. I have examined four topics about which informationis scant or nonexistent in Western languages: Amdo in theseventeenth century, Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s own quest to become ahermit, his ecumenical associations and writings, and his tantricpractices. From Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s personal accounts, we have learnedwhat life was like under Mongol supremacy, the nature of Tibetan-Mongol relations in Amdo, how he viewed Central Tibet as thesource of the teaching, and how he and others spread the Dge lugs pasect in his homeland. We have also read numerous songs telling uswhy a Dge lugs pa—who has been immersed in traditional trainingin the very Central Tibetan monastery that Tsong kha pa himselffounded, and who subsequently starts both a school of explanationand a tantric seminary and has hundreds of disciples—would want to"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS261become a hermit, what he is looking for, and his struggle to weanthose who were dependent on him so that he could live the life hewanted in solitary places. Accounts of ecumenical tendencies of Dgelugs pas in the early seventeenth century are unknown in Westernliterature, since seventeenth-century Tibet—with the installing of thefifth Dalai Lama on the throne of Tibet in 1642 after three centuriesof civil war between the Dge lugs pas and the Karma pas—is a timein which such associations would have been very delicate. Yet inSkal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs and writings we have petitions andhomages to saints on the opposing side of the war, the Karma pas,and demonstrations of an especially strong relationship with Mi laras pa. Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs are furthermore a rich source ofpersonal information about his tantric practices, which belong to thelineage of the Dga’ ldan Oral Tradition of Mah›mudr›, since none ofthe other lineage holders up to his time wrote mgur. I have also approached the Mgur ’bum from the point of view ofthe wealth of styles it exhibits. This is the first in-depth analysis ofany collection of mgurin any Western language. I have built uponwhat Don grub rgyal, SØrensen, Jackson and Eppling have writtenabout religious songs by analyzing the Mgur ’bum with respect todialogue, metrics, stanza patterns and poetic figures, and providingmany examples. I have concluded that Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgurhave been influenced by both classical verse and folksongs. Thewide diversity of influences upon his mgur reflects his multiple areasof expertise and interest, and dichotomous way of life. The fact thatthe folk influence far outweighs the classical mirrors his ultimatedecision to be a hermit in the mountains rather than to remain animportant leader and teacher in a monastery. The variety of meters,stanza patterns and poetic figures in the Mgur ’bum indicates Skalldan rgya mtsho’s enthusiasm and ability to write in many styles. In the very unusual form of mgur in conversations withanimals—bees, lice, fleas and lice eggs—we have seen Skal ldanrgya mtsho’s preoccupation with the themes of residing in solitude,renunciation and practice worked out in the form of conversationswith insects. The insects take on a didactic role as his teachers, andhe surprisingly portrays himself in an inferior role to them, some-thing I have not yet seen in any mgurtranslated into a Westernlanguage."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS262 The many meters Skal ldan rgya mtsho uses show the influence ofa wide spectrum of singing styles in Tibet. I have found that on theone hand, Skal ldan rgya mtsho is skilled in one of the traditionalmeters of classical Tibetan monastic verse (2 + 2 + 2 + 3); on theother, most of his meters are found in folk songs. Because his choiceof meters in the Mgur ’bum shows a preponderance of folk influence,I believe that he sang his mgurin folk melodies, a hypothesis furthersupported by my analysis of how his songs are sung today. Because Skal ldan rgya mtsho tends to use some stanza forms inparticular ways, and sometimes chooses a particular form for theparticular type of statement he wants to make, and because unusualstanza lengths are often accompanied by other unique features ofstyle and/or theme, I have concluded that Skal ldan rgya mtsho is notonly experimenting with unusual stanza lengths but also with dis-crete ways of writing songs. His choices of stanza patterns, like hischoices of meters, are influenced mainly by folk songs but also byclassical Tibetan verse, reflecting that his dichotomous way of lifeplayed a large role in bringing a wide range of influences to hiswriting. Some of his poetic figures show the direct influence of Da ̊ ̃in’sK›vy›darŸa,The Mirror of Poetics. When ornate poetry (k›vya,snyan ngag) appears in mgur, it is likely to be by song-writers whohave had a monastic education. Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s thorougheducation at Dge’ ldan sets him apart from many composers of mgurrelated to the Bka’ brgyud pa school—such as Mi la ras pa—whomwe normally associate with mgur, who were not educated in monas-teries. I have found that some of Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs in-clude poetic figures written in accordance with the K›vy›darŸa, ofwhich I have provided examples. I have also shown examples of figures he uses that were not in-spired by Da ̊ ̃in’s text: similes, metaphors, parallelisms, continualrepetition of the same finite verb at the end of each line of verse,sequences of numbers, and interjections. Again, I have concludedthat the indigenous poetic figures in his mgurfar outweigh the clas-sical ones. Still today there exists a tradition of monks and lay soloists whosing Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s mgur regularly in rituals. This isexceptional: the singing of most other siddhas’ mgurhas died out inspite of the fact that mgurwere intended to be sung. And while it is"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS263true that Mi la ras pa’s mgur are still sung, there is no standardizationof performance style. By contrast, there is a general standardizationof how Skal ldan rgya mtsho’s songs are to be performed today. Ananalysis of the present style of singing them is a valuable source ofinformation, since it may shed light on how Skal ldan rgya mtshosang his mgur in the seventeenth century. The closest match in allTibetan music to the melodies of the soloists who sing Skal ldan rgyamtsho’smguris the folk songs of Eastern Tibet. Therefore, it islikely that Skal ldan rgya mtsho used the tunes of folk songs thatwere currently popular in his day, or improvised on them, to sing hismgur.His disciples, the mountain hermits, would have been familiarwith the tunes he was singing and would have felt a sense of rapportwith him and his teachings. The memory of Skal ldan rgya mtsho is still vibrant in thepeople’s hearts throughout Amdo today. His reincarnational lineageremains one of the highest in the area of Reb gong, where the es-teemed eighth incarnation presently resides. The first Skal ldan rgyamtsho is usually depicted in paintings and statues with attributes ofAvalokiteŸvara, indicating that he is thought to be a manifestation ofthe bodhisattva of compassion. His right hand is at his ear, the clas-sic posture for singing mgur. His left hand holds a volume of hiswritings, and there is a Dge lugs pa hat on his head. This iconog-raphy shows that now in the twenty-first century his unusual combi-nation of identities is still held in mind and revered: he is a deity anda monk, a Dge lugs pa scholar who wrote texts and a siddha whosangmgur.Directions of Future ResearchIt is my hope that this first commentary on Skal ldan rgya mtsho’sMgur ’bum may lead to further research in a number of areas.Seventeenth-century Eastern Tibet was in a huge state of transitionwith the migration of the Qoshot Mongol tribe into Amdo, theshifting of power there away from the Tümed to the Qoshot, and itsuse as a base to effectuate the enthronement of the fifth Dalai Lamaby Gushri Khan. For these reasons, and in order to study theinteractions of the Tibetans and Mongols in Amdo and the expansionof Dge lugs pa school there, other sources that contain information"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS264about seventeenth-century Amdo should be sought out andtranslated. Moreover, Dge lugs pa mgur that show folksong influence arerare. There are no collections of mgur attributed to lineage holders ofthe Dga’ ldan Oral Tradition of Mah›mudr›. The mgur of more Dgelugs pa siddhas should be sought out from among their CollectedWritings and translated. It is still a mystery who could have beenSkal ldan rgya mtsho’s predecessor in this regard. Furthermore, someof the lama’s instructions (zhal gdams) from the twelfth century onweremgur, and played a role in the transmission of the genre. Thesemgur also need to be studied. This is the first extended analysis of the styles of any collection ofmgur. It is my hope that it may serve as a springboard for furtherstudies in mgur by providing a foundation for future comparisons. Ihave introduced a methodology for analyzing a collection of mgurthat I hope will be of use to future scholars. More mgur need to be recorded. A search for other mgur that arestill sung today and that have a standardization of performancewould be very valuable. Recording folk songs from places in thevicinity and comparing styles could tell something about the originalmelodies of a set of mgur. The study of mgur is a very rich field for autobiographical mater-ial as it tells us things in a personal way virtually unique amongTibetan literature. The study of its styles can lead to the discovery ofa fascinating blend of the most ornate poetry and folk-influencedlines.Mgurare still sung today and can be heard in valleys and onmountains geographically tucked away from the erosion of time.They still remain in the hearts of those who continue the tradition asan integral part of their lives, singing the songs at such crucial timesas before the planting, before the harvest, at times of drought andwhen someone has passed into the bar do, or transition state betweendeath and rebirth."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"APPENDICES"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"APPENDIX ASELECTEDMGUR TRANSLATED IN FULLIndexIII-1..............................................................268III-9..............................................................274IV-1.............................................................276IV-2........................................................282IV-3........................................................288IV-8........................................................296IV-9........................................................304V-8.........................................................310V-11.......................................................312V-16a.....................................................316V-20.......................................................320V-21.......................................................324VI-7........................................................326VII-2......................................................330VII-6......................................................336VII-7......................................................340VII-10a...................................................342VII-11....................................................346VII-17....................................................352VII-19....................................................356VIII-26...................................................360X-9.........................................................364Index According to Topicconversations with animals....................IV-1, 2hermitages and solitary places...............VII-2, 6, 7, 10, 17behavior, self-criticism..........................IV-9, V-11, VI-7,VII-7happiness................................................V-8, VII-11nature.....................................................VII-2, 11, 19imploration to a deceased lama..............V-20, X-9impermanence........................................V-16a, 21metaphors...............................................IV-3interjections............................................IV-8, VIII-26"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A268III-1, pp. 33-34/ 30-31[av-V“]-D\u0002-fz#-ldn-v-sXe-zhv-]n!

At present, there are atleast four extant versions in Tibet:4________4 There was also an edition published in India in 1994, made from a copy writtenout by hand by A khu Khri rgan tshang, the brother of the seventh Skal ldan rgyamtsho, during the former’s stay in India sometime after 1958. There are supposed tobe copies of Khri rgan tshang’s hand-written copy in the libraries in Dharamsala andVaranasi. I have no information on which version of the Mgur ’bum Khri rgantshang’s copy was based. The 1994 publication includes an introduction in Tibetanby Rab gsal, a former resident of Reb gong. He provides a concise biography of Skalldan rgya mtsho, lists the titles in his Collected Writings, and discusses briefly suchtopics in the Mgur ‘bum as style, themes and language. See Skal ldan rgya mtsho,Grub dbang skal ldan rgya mtsho’i mgur ’bum, ed. Rab gsal (Varanasi: Rig pa’byung ba’i grong khyer dpe sgrig sde tshan, 1994).

Moreover, the order and number of thelines are the same, with only two exceptions.7 The most pronounced difference among the four versions is on thelevel of words and syllables. I have sought to make a critical editionfor all poems used in this book by making the best choice amongthese versions. Occasionally I have felt it necessary to propose yetanother suggestion for a syllable that does not appear in any of theextant editions. My critical edition of all material quoted in this booklargely relies on common usages listed in Bod rgya tshig mdzod chen________5 In 1751 when Khri rgyan ’Jam dbyangs Dge ’dun bstan ’dzin was thirty-five,he is said to have heard the voice of Skal ldan rgya mtsho saying, “If you put myMgur ’bum onto woodblocks, benefit will come to the teaching and sentient beings.”He became the editor of the undertaking, which was completed in 1756. From 1778,the woodblocks were administered by the corporation (bla brang) of the lineage ofKhri rgan.

In the A and Bversions of Mgur I-1, one stanza is repeated twice and another stanza once; theserepetitions do not occur in C or D.
