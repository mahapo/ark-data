Despite its lacunae and imperfections, I hope this work VI'ill be a modest contribution to the knowledge of the Tibetan universe. Even at the ethnological level, astrology is seldom studied and is often regarded with a degree of Contempt. None~ theless, it remains a source of knowledge regarding the civiliza-tion that produced it, and is the vehicle for numerous myths and ancient cultural influences. Particularly for Tibetans, astrology can only be understood .as part of a cosmology-a vision of humanity in the universe, in the planetary environment I invite the reader to a discovery of this vision.

It is noteworthy, nevertheless, that most of the great rivers of Asia rise in Tibet, including the Huang Ho, the Yang·tze, the Salween and the Mekong in the east, and the Indus and the Brahmaputra in the west. The Tibetan cultural area is not confined to the great Tibetan plateau, however, but extends to the south into certain areas of Nepal such as the Dolpo and the Sherpa lands, as well as into the enclaves of the small Himalayan kingdoms of Sikkim' and Bhu-tan, To the west, it includes the highlands of \"Little Tibet,\" La-dakh, Spiti, Zangskar, and Lahul. Although Tibet is seemingly isolated, the cultures of all the surrounding countries have influenced it: India and Nepal to the south; China to the east; Kashmir and Afghanistan to the west, the to Central Asia; and Mongolia to the north, Tibet maintained cultural and commercial relations with its t.;.>t,eii~hljo'rs.

' Later, in the regions of Yarlung (0 the south, there arose what is known as Po Yul, or Tibet. Both the Buddhist and Bon roval chronicles agree as to the succession of Tibetan kings, the first of whom are semilegendary, related to the sky, then to the atm'a-sphere and later to the earth, The first king was Nyatri Tsenpo, and both he and his successors are said to have been connected to the sky by a magic thread, the mu cord, which reached .frolll the crown of their heads to the world above.

Ancient Chinese Sources mention the presence of nomadic Tibeto-Mongol peoples in the northeast of Tibet, but many other peoples seem to have comributedto the formation of the Tibetan peoples, The Indo-European Dards from the west and the Hors, a Turko-Mongol people,begantlJ be assimilated toward the seventh century, Although tpemajor-ity of Tibetans have clearly Mongoloid fearures, these are commonly found in the eastern regions-than in and there are even fair-haired, blue-eyed Amdo in the northeast, Ethnic groups show ~rl~atdi'rer:!itl!,Stl.cb as the Golok of the extreme e.st, the Lo and the Mon of the south. lll' )e,\"nnasl1l\\tll~ro\\ls.'liJIJ,~t$'· and there are significant dil:leJ\"ences the west, and the official l~;~b:~::n()::p~,t:,;.:,: also between these ,.ndthe Khampas, the Amd.opas, and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"\\ IIlI IAN '\\'>'fH(li ,II\" dwrc i,~ ;! \\\"ultuul ullin' h\"scd ('11 ndturJI tr,lir'\\ ,llld ;1 common 'wntrcn The Tih('fanS form two di\"tinn gr~HJPS <Hxnrding to their lift'~ style: the sc-dc!1t;\\ry :-lhricultur;llists known;ls the 7hingpa or 50-n,;'1mpJ.; and dw nml),hlic )'Jk-hrc('dcrs, rhe Drokp'l, who live in tents.

The latter, in their turn, consider the Dn)kpa as bumpkins; but this does not in any way prevent commercial relations across their borders. Some peasants have not only land but also herds-these are the Samadrok, \"neither too attached to the land nor nomads/' and it is not uncommon for one part of a family to be concerned with agriculture while the other takes the herds to pasture dur-ing summer. The nomads are more numerous in the north and east, in the steppes and the high plateaus, while the sedentary agriculturalists occupy the valleys below the tree line and the snow line. The main crop is barley, which grows well at high altitudes and from which /Sampa (roasted barley) is made, the staple food of the Tibetans~ In addition, radishes, turnips, and cabbages are The yak and the dri, or female yak, provide meat, milk, and cheese. Other domestic animals include the dZQ, a .~.r\",,,hP·,,,,een the yak and the cow. Tea, imported from China, basis for the famous Tibetan salted butter tea, a invigorating drink.

The m?nasric clergy occupied a very important place in Ti-betan society. rv:onasteries were extremely numerous before the cultural revolutlon, some comprising no more than a few cells around a temple and others being enOrmous .and virtuallv con-stituting townships. These large monasteries often held ~everal thousand monks, the great majority of whom \\llere concerned more with administrative and economic duties or estate manage-ment than with religious practice. A minority of monks, selected for their abilities and tested in often highly difficult examin.-~ions, carried on religious studies that they later pursued further III colleges specializing in philosophical and tantric studies. Graduation from a monastery could offer opportunities for so ... cial advancement, and it was from monastery graduates that gov-~ ernment officials were selected.

This form of marriage, which prevented the breakup of property, was found chiefly among agriculturalists and peasants, If the oldest brother died or had no children, a younger brother succeeded him.

THE TIBETANS AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT Tibet consists of vast spaces bordered by imposing mountain ranges. ~he dry climate produces sharp, ciear colors and vividly contrastmg s~apes.

The same organi7~J,tion IS found in the Tibetan house: the first floor is reserved for animals, \"\",hile the second floor is the human habitation properly so called, with a fireplace. The third floor is a terraced roof. and here a chapel is often built, a place of prac-tice and offerings. This is therefore the ideal \"high place,\" re-lated to the upper world. Here is found the fire for smoke offerings and the banners showing the Wind Horse, intended to bring good luck to the hearth. A vertical axis passes through the center of these three levels: this opening to the sky, located at the level of the central hearth, is the \"sky door,\" which is sometimes \"dosed\" during certain astrological rituals in order to avoid problems related to the gods above. This may also be the \"earth door,\" located at the bottom, which is dosed in order to break communication with the subterranean deities.

THE ASTROLOGER IN TIBETAN SOCIETY In Tibet, the astrologer (tsipa) is generally a lama, whether monk or layman. In the large monastic establishments, it was the dutY of the astrologer monks to fix favorable dates for ceremonie, and to compile calendars for religious events and holidays.

At the moment of death. the astrologer would draw up a spe-cial horoscope in accordance with the \"astrology of the dead\" in order to determine the best way to proceed with the funeral arrangements, Taking account of the moment of death and the astrological characteristics of the deceased, he would determine the moment for taking the corpse out of the house, the direction in which it should be carried, and the way in which the ceremon-ies should be conducted, The funeral arrangements were con-nected with the elements: Air (dismemberment of the corpse and offering different parts of it to the vultures); Fire (funeral pyre); Earth (burial); or Water (immersion in a river), \"Sky burial\" was the most frequent form of funeral in areas poor in wood and light soil. It is possible that this custom derives from Persian inlluence, for the Parsecs expose their dead to the vultures on top of towers, Certainly, Tibetan funeral customs have never failed to strike the Western imagination. Cremation was rare, ,~d -iras reserved for religious dignitaries, while the other tWO were exceptional.

The cosmogonic myths of Bon assume numerous forms, but there are always r\\Yo constants: creation from cosmic eggs; and the dualistic nature of creation, which begins with the formation of a divine world of light and a demonic world of darkness. The int1uence of the Persian :Mazda religions is clear in these dualistic myths, and it can be assumed that Mesopotamian astrological knowledge also reached Tibet through Bon. At the center of the world is the axial mountain, Mount Ti Se. This is the meeting point between heaven and earth, and at its peaJ,there is a celestial ladder, namtak, analogous to the mu c()rd of the first kings.

CHINESE ORIGINS Chinese astrology forms the basis of tWo great systems within Tibetan astrology: Naktsi, or \"black astrology)\" which refers to the Tibetan name for China, Gyana.k, meaning \"black area\";;! and Jungtsi, the \"astrology of the elements,\" which is concerned with the calendar and which we shall later examine in detail.

He em-ployed four astronomers to watch the four celestial regions, and the)' calculated rhe seasons, observing the cycles of beings' activ-ities in the course of the seasons. Connecting seasons with direc-tions, they divided the year into four periods: spring (East), summer (South), autumn (West), and winter (North), Yao in-vented the intercalary months in order to connect the solar and lunar calendars, The Great Emperor Yu (2206-2197 a,cE,), founder of the Hia -dynast}') composed the \"Great Rule\" treatise, inspired by the designs he saw on the back of a tortoise emerging from the River Lo, This design, tbe Lo Shu, is the magic square from wbicb the of the Tibetans originated, J Chitzg as. we know it in its definitive form comes down i .~' ••• ,<.,~-King Wen and dates from the time when he was im-of the tyrant Chou Hsin (ca, 1132 B,CE,), the Duke of Chouj wrote the commentary to it. ofasttro1\",·v and geomancy had thus been completely ill Chir .. by the first millennium before our era, It is surptmtin~ that these systems should have reached •• .. fu:tW di,ieu., the origin of the cycles of twelve and \",,,,.h.

The ten ccleqial trunks were soon as<;imi-laud to the five e~ements, Yin alternating with Yang. At the same tune, there developed in China the system of twelve animals. Originally there were only four of these: the Spring Dragon of the East, the Summer Bird of the South the Autumn Tiger of the West, and the Winter Turtlc of the N~rth. Later developments gave rise to six, eight, and finally twelve ani~ mals, as Lois de Saussure has conclusively demonstrated. These twelve animals were later assimilated to the (\"!,ve1ve terre-3trial branches, although they were of a different nature_ This merging of the two systems took place at the beginning of our eta, and it was the system of twelve animals and five elements that was introduced and popularized throughout Central Asia. Accord-ing to late Tibetan sources, it was the princess Kongjo who in-troduced this system to Tibet in 642, although this is by no means certain, Be that as it mav, the Tibetans have named their years according to this syste~ of animals ever since~ although they did not use the sixty-year cycles at this time.

From the historical point of vlew, we know that as early as the third millenium B.C£', a vcry advanced civilization flourished at Mohenjo-Daro in the Indus valley. This non-Indo-European culture enjoyed regular trading contact with the Sumerians of l\\-1esopotamia, as witness the numerous objects discovered at ar-chaeological sites. From this era onwards, ideas circulated be-tween these tWO centers of civilization. Indi<ln astrology shows evidence of this cultural interchange in its adoption of a zodiac identical to that of the Mesopota-mians: thus Indian astrology uses a system of twelve signs and twelve houses; while the decans are common to Egypt, Mesopo-tamia, Greece, and India. Indian and Western astrology thus share -common origins~ but in contrast to the Western system, Indian astrology remains faithful to the early sidereal zodiac, based on fixed stars. India also had early contact with China, and there are cer-tainly connections linking the twenty-eight Chinese lunar con-stellations or Siu and the twenty-seven or twenty-eight Indian .J\"l .. ,b.·tr.,s, mentioned in the Vedas.

Thus the Kalacakra teachings were spread among the inhabitants of Shambhala, What is this mysterious land of Shambhala that has caused-so much wandering among travelers and esotericists?

At present, the Twemv-first Kulika king reigns in Shambhala, Magakpa, who ascended the throne in 1927. He will be succeeded by Miyi Senge tn the year of the Fire Sheep of the seventeenth cycle (2027). It is predicted that under the Twenty-fifth king, Rudra the Bearet of the Wheel, Drakpo Khorlo Chang, a great war will break out in the year 2425 of our era between all the negative forces of the planet and the kingdom of Shambhala. The victory of the Kulika king will usher in a new era of prosperity on earth and the teachings of the Buddha will flourish again for eighteen hundred years. At the end of this period, 5,014 years after the Buddha's parinir'f)iiry.t!,4 the teach.;. ings will fade. This is the story told of the kingdom of Sham~ bhala and its relations with our world. An Indian master, Chilupa, set out for the kingdom of Sham~ bhala during the tenth century.

We maY add that in our own time, the Kalacakra initiation has been gjve~ numerous times all over the world, by both the Dalai Lama and the Venerable Kalu Rinpoche, in order to promote world peace, However, very few people are able to practice the imernal and alternative levels of Kaiacakra, which are under-taken in long retreats. The influence of Kalacakra on Tibetan astrology has been considerable. It is noteworthy that it contains not only all the dements of Indian astrology but also a synthesis of the princi-ples of Chinese astrology, Thus the sixty-year cycle, adopted by1heTibetans in 1027, is based on the merging of the Indian sexagenary cyde of the Kalacakra with that of Chinese as-\"\"logy, THE BIRTH OF ASTROLOGY TO THE PADMA TFiANCYlK this 'account of the history of Tibetan astrology, astold in the Padma Thangyik, the biog-arr,bttav.a.

Candr'aklrti (sixth cen'-tury), the great commentator on Nagarjum,l describes these as follows: All phenomena possess two natures: That which is revn\\ed by correct perception And that which is induced by deceptive perception, The object of correct perception is ultimate reality, The object of deceptive perception is conventional reality, -MADHYAMAKAvATAR;\\, VI, 23 The same phenomenon) therefore, may be perceived accord-ing to its ultimate nature or its apparent nature. Ultimate reality is also called \"emptiness.\" \"Emptiness\" does not mean that all phenomena are nothing, but rather that they do not exist in themselves. Although phenomena, the universe, thoughts) beings, time, and so on, seem to be very real in them\", selves, ultimately they are not.

What can be concluded from this?

The \"rainbow\" phe-nomenon, in fact, depends on the phenomena \"sun rays,\" \"rain,\" and \"time\"; it therefore does not exist of itself. The emp-tiness of a phenomenon means that it exists neither in itself nor of itself. \\Xi'hat we have said regarding the rainbow can equally be ap-plied to other phenomena. Ask yourself, what is \"I\"? Although v,re identify with it, this \"1\" is also a transitory compound, an assemblage of feelings, perceptions, sensations, ideas, and so on, whose nature is always open to question. Its ultimate nature is none other than emptiness. There is thus the emptiness of phe-nomena and the emptiness of self, the emptiness of subject and object What about time? The idea of time is closely linked to that of lju,su,coesslon of events, that is, to actions, to causes and effects. act, your action feeds on your past.

Known in Tibctan as kun dzop, \"the reality that encloses all things,'\" this is none other than the ap~ pearance of phenomena as we perceive them through our senses. Since the perception of each being is different, then: will be as many perceptions of phenomenal appearances as there are be-ings in the universe. One day, according to a legend. the astrolo-ger of a small Indian kingdom warned the king that there would soon fall on the land a rain \"that would send people mad.\" This news quickly spread, and everyone, from the humblest to the most powerful, hurried to stock as much drinking water as pos-sible. The rain began to fall, as predicted. The less consequential people, who had few reserves) were soon obliged to drink the rainwater and became mad. Then it was the turn of the mer~ chants, the rich people, and finally the ministers themselves-all were forced to drink the contaminated water. Only the king, with his vast reserves, remained sane. And everyone throuChout the kingdom was convinced that it was tbe king who v.\"aS mad. This story illustrates the relative nature of conventional reality.

Since sensory perception is conditioned by our karmic ten-dencies, it is at the same time \"relative\" and \"misleading,\" Karma, indeed, is always connected with ignorance.

The absolute and apparent reality of the same phenomenon are opposed to each other-indeed, since perception varies from one individual to another, the apparent nature of an object varies also. and for this reason its apparent nature cannot be its ulti-mate nature, which is unique, .The two realities are inseparable-according to the Prajiiapara-i< .1'l'ttaHr\"da1/a Stitra\" \"\",ptine,,,, emptiness is form.

Thus phenomena are not \"destroyed\" by emptiness: they continue to appear in dependence upon each other, all empty. The twO realities are like the two sides of the same coin. SA)ylSARA AND NIRVANA Why does Buddhism emphasize emptiness? Not knowing the ulti~ate nature of things means believing that their appe.arance is the only reality.

This applies at both the (01-lectiye and the individual leveL Astrology is a practical discipline intended to reduce suffering and uncertainty, which are the lot of beings wandering in saJ;}lsara. The correct motivation for an astrologer is none other than compassion-without that, astrol-ogy falls to the level of the otdinary disciplines. As a science of time, the fundamental doctrinal basis of astrol-ogy is a perfect understanding of the laws of causality: in other v..'Ords! karma and the links of interdependence, the two chief mechanisms of relative existence. THE WHEEL OF LIFE AND THE LAWS OF CAUSALlTY there is a well-known graphic description of the laws o:u;\"u\",lIty: the Wheel of Life or Sipe Khorlo, which illumates ~lle.Ill,:c~.anjsnos binding us to sa1!lsara.

This theory of the correspondence between manocosm and microcosm is also found in the \\Vest, most notably in Paracelsus (1493-1541), the doctor and hermetic astrologer. This theory is borne out by the teaching of the tantras. As ... vc have discussed, all phenomena arise from the luminous creativity of the mind, but under the influence of ignorance, we conceive the existence of a dualistic world ln which \\\\Fe distinguish \"J\" and others, subject and object, internal and external. Thus the gross external elements and the gross internal constituents of the body afe one and the same in their origin, as explained above.

Contact (sparsa) is represented by a couple embracing. The meeting of the senses and their objects creates contact-thus sight makes contact with forms, hearing makes contact with sounds. and so on.

Each sign is an archetype of the various functions of the sun) reflecting the variations of soiar influence as colored by its passage through the sky, In the East, the year consists of twelve lunations, These twenty-seven or twenty~eight lunations or lunar mansions are a of \"lunar zodiac,\" and daily life is linked to the phases of '''f'' '\"'UUIl, The tides, the growth of piants, the weather, the men-and the individual's psychic characteristics are all be affected by lunar cycles, At the full moon, psychic at i~s--peakl and accidents, acts of violence) and mental to be more frequent, The power of this lunar influ-u$ed to advantage: in the Buddhist calendar, fulI-of the Buddha, and is devoted to the prac-that advantage can be taken of this intensity ··.·~,ti'i)lol':y is not uuaware of the importance of the 50 1 NT f( 0 lJ lj ( r!

The names of the elements-Wood, Fire, Earth, Water, and Metal-are symbolic: they allow description of the dements by analogy, but have little to do with the objects of the same name. None of the elements is good or bad in itself. However) in con-tact with each other they react according to their affinities. There are therefore favorable, neutrall and harmful relations.

We may refer here to the Tibetan text, whieh says; \"The' rda~ tions between elements arc those of mother, S~ll; friend,' ,Ot enemy.

Th~s the cutting property of metal enables it to cut and chop wood; while fire can make metal malleable and even melt it. Water extin-guishes fire; earth absorbs water; and wood feeds on earth. Conversely, the defeated element is the servant of the con-queror because it benefits it. This is the relationship of friend, ship: \"The friend of Wood is Earth; the friend of Earth is Water· the friend of Water is Fire; the friend of Fire is Metal· the friend of Metal is Wood.\" ' These relations are summarized in table 2. .... ··· .. 111\"''\" relations are binary, but if a third element is present it :·C'Ul .• ini.er'«rle to modify the process.

In Chma, a system of twelve branches was classically used to express the cycle of twelve years. The twelve animals ar~ a later development, but they were quickly assimilated to the more abstract system of branches. The Tibetans use the cvde of twelve years only in this later form-there has never be~n any system of branches, only symbolic animals. The twelve animals are: Rat (Chi) Dragon (Druk) Monkey (Tre) Cow (Lang) Snake (Trul) Bird (Ja) Tiger (fak) Horse (Ta) Dog (Khyi) Hare (YO) Sheep (Lnk) Pig (Phak) Each animal is associated with an dement, which reIP\",..\"ts life force. The Tiger and the Hare are Wood, \"\" ,>V,,. ~\".,.. .,,\" Snake are Fire. The ~llkey and the Binl.re the Rat are Water.

THE COW The Cow is a real monolith. Stable, solid, tenacious, and ob-stinate, it is a great worker.

THE TfGER The Tiger is a symbol of aW<1kening to life, which it seize-s enthusiastically and with determination. Unpredictable J.od d.ar-ing, the Tiger dislikes monotony. It likes to put itself forward and command, but hates to obey and is a fierce enemv of hierar-chy and conventlon.' / The Tiger's fondness for independence leads It to an uncon-ventional lifestyle.

The Sheep has a strong sense of justice, but is indulgent and easily forgiYes. It loves nature and is sensi-tiw' to art but never strays from the beaten track. Independent by natu;e, the Sheep can adapt to circumstances and seeks the protection of powerful people. It follows the trend, is terrified by obstacles, and leaves it to others to take responsibilities. It is a first-class team member but has no initia-tive and cannot exercise leadership. In its desire to be protected, it can easilv allow itself to be used. The She~p is a pessimist and a worrier, easily loses its practical sense, and takes refuge in dreams, becoming whimsical, eccen-tric, or even theatrical. In adversity, the Sheep sulks in a corner and its weakness is disarming. It gets what it wants without vio-lence and by devious paths and does not hesitate to become a parasite. The Sheep has a great deal of filial spirit. In love, it is superfi-cial and unstable, but a protective partner is good for it.

This method is uniqu\" lo.Tl!)etan astrology, and is very important in scopes. The five individualioreos are the L\", \"\",.\",~,,,,,.,\"~' U;img thang, and the Lung la. The La is the \"soul,\" the \"Sl,iri·t\"--to Tibel~illBulldJlj~tS,.tlll·. is chidly a psychic principle conneaed La is luminolls and normally residc:!j through which it moves in acc.ordanee According to the K~I\"cakra t,,\",hing,; occurs in the left side ill males [he new moon (30th and j.\"l,,·s\",1 f'lUnd in the soles of the to gender.

Tibctan doctors theref(1fC take account of th(~ cycles t)f the moon in order to ensure rh.af even the mn.st trivial operations do not prescm a threat to life, The La is normallv located in the body, but it call leave and wander in the e-xtL\"rn~l world when energy is low and when an individual faints or is in a coma. In such cases, a ritual is per-formed, the \"recalling of the La\" or Laguk, the object of which is to lead the La back to the body, When the La is weak, it can also be seduced and carried off by a class of demons known as sn'-this is a case of possession, which can be remedied by the \"repurchase of the La.\" Black magicians can summon an ene-my's La by force and achieve mastery over the individual con-\",'med-in attacks of this sort, the victim is weakened and falls ilL Here also there is an appropriate ritual to terminate this act of magic violence, At the time of death, it is said that the La will sun~ve anywhere-in the grave, for example-but is not reincarnated, It is then able to visit the living. Although it is connected with the body, the La often resides in an external object connected with the individual's life. This maybe a hill or a mountain (La ri), a tree (La ,hing), or a stone $Uchas the \"turquoise of life\" (La yu). In this case, the La is iqentified with the Lha, or god of the area. In Tibet, one must mamtain ,harmonious relations with the environment, for local deities or external La influence the life force. Polluting or de-stroying the habitation of an external La will constltute a danger to the individual's own life, There seem to be many points of similarity between the La hand and the Hun soul of the Chinese and the Ka or the Egyptians on the other.

ANIMALS, ELEMENTS, AND INDIVIDUAL FORCES Each animal corresponding to the elements represents one of the fiye forces. According to our astrological text: The Vitality of the animals resides in the elements of [he direc-tions. The Vitality of the Tiger and the Hare is Wood, that of the Horse and the Snake is Fire. The Vitality of the Monkey and the Bird is Metal and that of the Rat and the Pig is Water. As for the Cow, the Sheep, the Dog, and the Dragon, all four have the Vitality of the Earth element. This refers to working out the elements of the Sok. The text continues, \"The mother of Vitality is called the La.\" The ele-ments of the La are simply those that engender the elements of the Sok. For example, the La element of the Horse is Wood, pecause ,Wood produces Fire, which is the Vitality element of me Horse. The \\\\'l<ng thang element is the same as the element that rules the year. For a person born in the year of the Metal Tiger, the Element of Personal Power is also Metal. The elements .of the Lu are arranged in a particular order over al;hl\"ty'vear period, each one governing two successive years. .Ia 'elements arc determined according to the fol-! ~ n !

This law brings to mind the rules of affinity for the animals' the animals that are grouped in a triad by the ~ame Wind Hors~ arc those that enjoy excellent relations. It should also be noted that enemy-animals are those whose Wind Horse elements afe opposed. This is the case for the Dog (Metal), which has bad relations with Dragon (Wood)-Metal is the enemy of Wood.

The Papme is derived from the Natal Mewa in accordance v:ith a particular mode of movemeor. This movement depends in effect on the masculine or feminine character of the natal year, not on the gender of the native: This is the method of rotation: begin a( the center and move toward the East. From the East, turn to the left if the [natal) year 1S masculine and to the right if the [natal) year is feminine. Then begin again at rhe center. .

This lunar zodiac is common to China, Ivlesopotamia, India, and the Arab world, although cer-tain variations are found. This system divides. the ecliptic into twenty-eight sectors) each marked by a characteristic star or group of stars.

The Cyukar and the Divisions oj the Zodiac The Tibetans divide the gola into twelve khyim (signs) and twenty-sevengyukar, both systems having 0° Aries as their point of origin. There is thus an overlap between the gyukar and the gola, whose divisions do not correspond. The only possible common division is the \"foot of the star,\" the Gyukang (Skt. Pada)) which is one quarter of a lunar mansion. We thus have the following subdivision: Gola (360°) = 12 Khyim = 27 Gyukar = 108 Gyukang (pada) 1 Khyim = 9 Gyukang 1 Gyukar (13\"20') = 4 Gyukang Therefore: J Kh)'im = 2 Gyukar + J Gyukang Thereis also a smaller subdivision, the Chu ISO: Jehu tso '\" '/6, of a Gyukar \"\" 'I\" of a Gyukang of .,these divisions is the gyukang. whil·h of a ,z()diacal sign and is identical to the Indian 132 I\\A\"T'>I i\\<;TIiOLnr,y The Characteristics of the Gyukar Each gYl.lkar is characterized hv 10 I d' I . d ' \" f' n Ian e ement (Wind rlre, Water, an E'1fth).

Chinese astrologers also use a system of intercalary months, but these are not calculated in the same way: when the Chinese year has thirteen months, the Tibetan year does not necessarily have the same number; and vice versa. Tables showing the dates of Chi-nese years are therefore of no use in Tibetan astrology, THE TIBETAN MONTH The lunar month normally comprises thirty lunar days and sometimes twenty'~nine; or five mean solar days. A lunar day or tse zhag is the time required for the moon to travel 12° from the sun. If D stands for the distance between the moon and the sun, the first lunar day is the period between D = 0' (new moon) and D = 12'. The second day begins at D = 12' and ends at D == 24°, and so on. Two points should be borne in mind: 1. The lunar day is not equal to the solar day or nyin zhag-I mean lunar day = 0,984 solar days, 2, The moon;s speed varies throughout the month. Lunar days, therefore, are not of equal length: most of them are shorter than solar days, but some are longer. The situa-tion is, therefore, more complex than would be the case jf alllu!}ar days were of equal length. >' ,ribetanastrologers fix the correspondences between solar and !\"nardays as follows. As we have seen, the lunar year has twelve 3o.lun.r days, or 360 lunar days altogether. However, Jr't-Ile '''''',. the .un rises 3,4 times, thus giving 354 solar .,:rh,,4iiffe:nir,ee is (360 -3,4) ~ 6 days per year.

The ,Names 0/ the Tibetan Months Since there are a number of parallel naming systems, it is not always easy to orient oneselL (See table 23, page 173,) 1. In one system, the months are named in numerical order: Dawa Dangpo or First Month, Dawa Nyipa or Second Month, Dawa SlJmpa, or Third Month, and so on. 2. In the Indian system, the months rake the name of the constellation in which the full moon Occurs: Chu Ddwa is the first month, since the full moon falls in the gyukar Chu, 3. 1n another system, the months art: named after the twdve )tnim~1s of the,Chinese cycle. but here there are three dif-ferent systems used. Suffice it to say that in the ilrst sys-t~ml' the, most common, the first month is the Month of rhe'pr;agon,thc second is the Month of' the Snake, and so . on\" This,is', the system U$ed in Jungrsi astrology. 156 712 ~ ~ 5/10 '\" .; \" 0 7/11 Z '\" Sill! -' .; v Z '\" '\" f-'\" :..u \" 0 Z .; Z .; f-\" '\" I \" f-'\" J: f-Z '\" '\" \" f-'\" '\" en '\" U Z w 0 Z 0 \" '\" '\" '\" '\" 0 u"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"CO < _+\",-\" ___ I; \" ,c ---t~;;~' ~'_ _ I ~ '2 :="},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"z I ! ! <\" , --\"\" :t.. 1-"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"\">/) -5 1 4n -9 .. 21 3111 4·) ··5 -17 +21 J(9 2 91 -) 4120 !O ~ 20;. 14i8 '-, 6!)0 -\" '\" -)0 5/10 ) 'fAil I E 22 ((,ONTINt:r!)j 11 _~ 1_' ~_ ' __ L~ ~ __ N I 1/ J ,,118 -t/28 M2fl 1'1114 lQl14 11/12 -+1112;;--\" -l'ii;1----lll '-10 25 '4 1,-7 'IB 6118 ~ , ~n -l' '\" ~-!; 11 1') i \\.1 \\ -,2'1 ,,-,,--~!1f.

All the factors of Nagtsi and Kartsi astrology so far described in yearly or monthly terms are also considered in determining the characteristics of days. The overall effect of these daily factors is considered before undertaking any activity-travel. work, ritual, and so on, A distinction must be drawn between the collective and per-sonallevels: Certain days are said to be auspicious or inauspicious for certain undertakings, and this applies universally. In this case? the daily energies are judged as either sufficiently good or sufficiently bad for all beings, whatever their per-~on.al ,astrological features.

Since there arc twelve hours in a day, the same cycle of animals is n:peated every day. The Jungtsi .lfen Ngak says: Each da.\\' ha~ si:x hour~ of da~ and six of night. Daybreak is the hour of th<:' Hare, sunri:.e is th~ hour of the Dragon, morn~ ing !$ the hour of the Snake, and noon is the hour of the Horse. The afternoon IS thE' hour of In,;; Sheep, and the evening IS the hour of the Ivlonkey, ':)unsc, is the hour of the Bird, twi!igh1.' is the hour of the Dog. The br.:&inning of night i~ d<e hour of the Pig. Midnight i~ the hour of tht, Rat. Tht end of the night is called the hour of the Cow and da\\m is the hour of the Tiger. The-hours. art natural period:::. of the day that mark different phas(.'\"s of rhe-sun's Journey across. the sky. The length of day and night and the time of sunrise vary throughout the year, and the correspondence between the Tibetan hours and Western hours is therefore only approxif'J1atc, In order to calculate the Tibetan hour correctly, it i~ necessary to know the length of the 212 r xl 1-' r I II F, T A ~,; fJ A Y daY and night and the time of sunri:;c. The Tibetan . . . I system JS tbus one of uncqua hours. The names of the animals-associated with the h , ' '.

The Horse corresponds to the South, the posmon of the sun at middaYi and So on, (There is an interesting parallel between the names of the hour) and the behavior of the associated animals: at sunset. birds are very loud, and dogs bark at dawn; at midnight, fats and mice are very active.) Kansi astrology associates the double hours with the signs of the zodiac (kh)ilm). Table 34 shows the associations. It does not seem to be necessary to convert to Lhasa time in order to calculate one's birth hour according to Tibetan hours. As we have seen, this system is concerned with local solar time, which is based on the apparent movement of the sun in the course of the day.

Each hourly animal is therefore associated with an element. To work out the hOUrly cycle of element5 for a given day, it is necessary only to know the rules of Jungtsi astrology, 1. The element of the first hour of the day (Hare) is the son of the element of the day. 2. The elements follow each other in their order of produc~ tion and change each double hour, In our example, 12/25/84 is a Waxer Dragon day. The son of \\Water is \\'V'ood. The double hours therefore have the following elements and animals: Wood Hare-Fire Dragon-Earth Snake-Metal Horse-Water Sheep-Wood Monkey-Fire Bird-Earth Dog-Metal Pig-Water Rat-Wood Cow-Fire Tiger. INTERPKETATlON Knowing the native-'s hour of birth and the element-animal combination allows one to refine one's judgment. The animal of the hour of birth is the mo:.-t important---somr writers on Chi~ nese astrology have compared it to [he ascendant in Western a;)~ trolQgy _ The hourly animal is therefore compared with the ~mal Qf the year of birth. and their relationship is considered: 1,>·'fh~s,t c().Il~iderati9m, of count, ~pply sp('cifi..:ally to ht·!wh ((I!lditi~)n~. ·J:fuWeYer, daylight ),;tving linl(: a~ applinl d:>l'wherc must bt' t.lk,·fl lilt{) a.q;I,)Unt_\" 2[4 Tlil' Tlflf.TAN O,.\\Y If the two anil.l1ah a~e the o;;;nne, tho:: characteristics indi-cated by the birth ammal :tre strengthened.

To cast these horoscopes, it is necessary first to calculate the data in Jungtsi astrology and then factor in the elements of Kartsi astrology.

The :Metal element does not weaken these characteristics but tends to push them to their lim-its, The native will thus have a tendency to impose his idealist views in a sharp and lively manner-one might say, then, a great deal of style but a lack of adaptability. Our native was born during the hour of the Monkey, which is the enemy of the Tiger. Both signs are bold and energetic, but the Tiger is a noble and plain-speaking idealist, occasionally a little mad, while the Monkey is rather more calculating: the Monkey is wily and prepared to leave his scruples on one side.

This \"speC( will operate above all in the realms governed by Jupiter (education, religion, social life, sw> cess, etc.). Jupiter, the natural benefic in the sign of human communica-tion (Aquarius), aspects Venus, also a benefic and in its domicile, Libra.

We shall use again the ex,lmple of a person born on 11/15/1950. We shall take the date Mar 23, 1988, and see v\"hether it is favorahle for the native, Compan\"ng Animal Signs. Comparing the animal signs is a mat-ter of wmparing the animal that rules the day with that which rules the natal da)'. In this conncnion, table 6 can be consulted. Thus, our native is a Tiger and the day in question is also Tiger. The relationship is neutral. Comparing Elements. Comparing elements consists of comparM iog the ruling element for the day with that of the natal year: thejr relationship is analyzed and the favorable or unfavorable qualit), of the day is determined. Thus, May 23 is Earth (table 28), and our native's ruling element is Metal. The Metal·Earth relat~onshlp is a. mother-relationship. Thus the day is very favor-abJe In terms of elements, The elements of Vitality, Body> Luck, or La can also be stud-ied in the same way, For example. let us determine whether the day in question is a lucky one for the native. The Wind element o! Earth Tiger is Metal, while that of Metal Tiger is also Metal. 1,he .Metal-Metal relationship is a bad one (table 10) so this is nota favorable day for luck, ., Comparing Mewas. In r.:omparing Mewas, the daily Mewa is ?O~pared, with tbe Mewa of the natal yt.'ar from tbe: clem. en! r()mtof':H.~w, In our example. tht· daily Mewa is Creen 4) whose ~l~Ul/:1lt l~ Wood; while the Mewa for the natal yt\"ar, Yellow 5. iii hnked with Earth 1'h w, .

Ite 8~ ;l~d. the Water-Metal relationship must therefore be conSIdered: thIs IS a son-relationship, which is neutral. In order to form an overall judgment of the tone of the da ' for the native, it is enough to consider the relationship betwee~ the ruling element of the day and the ruling natal element, and then the relationship between the Mewas of the oltal year and the day in question. If both judgments are positive, the day will be good. If they afC contradictory, as is the (:ase here, the day will be a mediocre onc. If both are bad, the day witi be inauspi-cious. The Days and Constellations with Reference to the Natal Animal. For any given animal, there arc auspicious and inauspi-:-cious days throughout the lunat month (table 27). May 13, 1983 is the 7th day of the lunar month, which is neutral for (heTige~~ If, on the other hand, the native had been a Bird, this would be a powerful day. .

They avoid disrurbing them and expect their concern to be Tecipro~ cated. They are often ,1sked for protection, and it is not unusual for a local deity to become the protector of .l village, a region, a monastery, or a spiritual lim'age. \\Y'hen Padmasambhava crossed the Himalayas on his way to Tibet, he subdued many hostile demons and local deities; indeed, not only did he subdue them, he forced them to take vows to protecr'the tantric teachings and practices, The following epi-sode is recounted in a short biography of Padmasambhava, a treasure text discovered in the nineteenth century by the tenon Chog)'ur Lingpa 0829-1879): At Phuru, I subjugated Dorje Legpa, king of the tenacious evil spirits; at Yasru and Yonru, I subdued specters and cannibal spirits. At Osam, 1 tamed Thaglha, the Lord of epidemics and plagues. All of these 1 bound by solemn oath to the Dharma. Padmasambhava also dominated hostile planetary forces. A{ Mount Ti Se (Kailash), I bound the stellar forces of the lunar mansiOns (G)'ubr) and on the Targo I placed the dark forces of the planet~ under the control of the Dharma. When a lama is preparing to bestow an initiation or when a yogi begins a retreat in a wild and lonely place, their first (011-~ern is the local deitles, They ask those deities to lend them the J~lace and they offer them a torrna or ritual cake.

All these gods ot natural forces appear as personal beings like those who populate the phenomenal world. They are no more or le&5 real than other beings. Among the six classes of being, some are known as Lha, \"gods,\" but this is to be understood as referring to a category of being midway between the gods of the sense rcalm, the ~1Suras, animals. and spirits. ~ The Buddhist teachings show the causes of the existence of these beings, If at death the consciousness leaves the body through the nostrils, this is a sign of rebirth among the natur~ spirits. Birth among the spirits may follow a life in the hen realms, The karmic circumstances surrounding the moment of death-assassination. violent death, hatred or passionate attach· ment, the breaking of monastic vows-may also bring about such a rebirth. There are numerous categories of such beings and it wQul(lbe very difficult to compile a clear and coherenr list.

The 'Ii'.'hok is surrounded by ,1 great ocean of salt water, which supports rhe cOl1tin('nts, In each of the cardinal directions, there is an island continent surrc~undcd by t\\VO smaller continents, There are thus twelve continents in total. At the East' is Videha (Lu Pakpo), surrounded b,' Dehu (Lu) and Videha (Lu pak). This continent is white and shaped like a half-moon. The people who live there are twice as tall as us and their faces resemble half-moons. They are peaceful vegetarians and live in towns and villages, Their life span is be-tween 250 and 500 years. Although their lives are pleasant, it is not greatly advisable to be reborn in their realm since they do not have the true Dharma. The chief characteristic of Videha is its mountain of diamonds, lapis-lazuli, saphires, emeralds, pearls, gold, silver, and crystal. In the South is Jumbudvlpa (Dzambuling), our own conti-nent, surrounded by Camara (Nga yap) and Upacamara (Ngayap zhen). Our world is a fortunate one, where budd has are born and the Dharma flourishes. It is blue and trapezoidal in shape. Its inhabitants have a life span of a century. Its main fea-ture is the thicket of trees that accomplish all desires and whose fruits fall as rain. In the West is the continent of Godaniya (Nub pa tangcho ling), surrounded by Shatha (Yoden) and Uttaramantrini (Lam-cbok dro). Godaniya is ruby red and circular in shape. Its inhabi-tants have round facts and they are four times as tall as us. They live fot' five centuries and follow a pastoral lift\\ living on the dairy produce of their beasts. Its main feature is the herd of wish-fulfilling heifen, each of whose udders give all that is de.sired. ~ To the North lies Uttarakuru (Draminyen Ling), surrounded 260 !\\Pf>f'Nf)lX I by Kurava ([):amin?en) and Karuava (Dr~miny~n gyi Da).

But Draminyen means \"with an unpleasant voice\"; and indeed, a week before they die, the inhabitants of Draminyen hear the grating voice-of death, which announces to them the way in which they will die and what sort of bad rebirth awaits them. Their suffering then exceeds what we undergo in a whole lifetime. The main attribute ofthis continent is the cereal that grows without effort1 an inex-haustible and delicious food. Although they are all inhabited by humans, these continents remain invisible to the eyes of the inhabitants of other wor1dsi' except for clairvoyants.
