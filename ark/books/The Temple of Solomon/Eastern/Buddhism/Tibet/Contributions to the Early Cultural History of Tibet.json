The study of an important Tibetan lexicon of archaic terms, the Li shi gur khang, together with the progress realized by F.W. Thomas in the investigation of the Dunhuang manuscripts in London, as well as Ch. Toussaint’s recognition of archaisms in the Padma bka’ thang, permitted the three scholars to launch a fruitful collaboration, resulting in the first sustained interpretation of a key collection of Old Tibetan historical texts. Though many aspects of their work have been by now superceded, Documents de Touen-houang remains a landmark in the study of early medieval Tibet. The considerable progress realized since that time has been due to the patient labours of Tibetanists in Europe and Japan, and increasingly in the Tibet Autonomous Region, China and the United States as well. With the application of new digital technologies to the reproduction and analysis of early Tibetan documents, what began as a slow trickle of research has grown into a stream, and matters that were formerly obscure to the point of unintelligibility have gradually come to be elucidated. With this development of the field, scholars are increasingly attending to the social and cultural milieux of the early period. This can be seen in the painstaking work of Tsuguhito Takeuchi in his investigations of letters, contracts and related documents dating to the imperial period.1 Attention to detail in the investigation of such quotidian matters adds depth and dimension to our understanding of a period that has all too often served as a pristine ground onto which scholars, both inside the Tibetan cultural area and beyond, have projected their idealizations of a heroic past, be it Buddhist or other-wise. The contributions to the present volume exemplify the concern for minute detail that is essential for progress in this area, but at the   1 T. TAKEUCHI 1995. Tibetan Contracts from Central Asia.

In part one, ‘Social and Political History’, the contributors examine key aspects of Tibetan imperial administration and post-imperial affairs. The first chapter, by Brandon Dotson, applies a social-historical approach to Old Tibetan legal documents, encoded within which the values and practices of the Tibetan Empire, and its rigid social stratification, are revealed. They also shed much light on such topics as Tibetan marriage and exchange patterns, loan contracts, corvée labour, the legal status of Buddhist temples and monasteries, and the conscription system of the Tibetan military. Strong centralization appears to have been the rule under the empire of the btsan po, and the diffuse ‘galactic polity’ that came to characterize later Tibetan regimes is hardly at all in evidence. One of the most intriguing aspects of Dotson’s chapter is the revelation that legal cases were often resolved with recourse to divination dice. Divination was a popular and widespread practice during the imperial period, and is discussed in Old Tibetan ritual texts in which ritual specialists known as bon and gshen employ mo divination in their healing rites. With the empire’s disintegration in the mid-ninth century, power devolved upon local authorities and strongmen, who took charge not just of the governance of their domains, but equally of their external relationships. Tibet, in effect, became for a time a cluster of indep-endent principalities. Bianca Horlemann’s chapter focuses upon the Inner Asian connections of one such realm, that of Tsong-kha in the northeastern region of Amdo. Though far removed from Tibet’s traditional central districts of Dbus-Gtsang, the effort to recapitulate aspects of Tibet’s earlier imperial configuration is evident in the later claim that Tsong-kha’s rulers were descended from the Yar-lung kings and the attribution to them, accordingly, of the title of btsan po. As prior studies have shown, the rise of the Tibetan Empire occasioned not only changes of power relations, but equally changes of knowledge, requiring new technologies associated with the spread of literacy:2 the redaction of legal procedure considered by Dotson offers a case in point. The ways and means of the transmission of knowledge during this period, however, are still but poorly under-   2 For instance, M.T. KAPSTEIN 2000.

The two chapters of part two, ‘Literary and Oral Trans-missions’, take up several dimensions of the question. Yoshiro Imaeda’s reconstruction and translation of the Dunhuang Tibetan text, History of the Cycle of Birth and Death, is already well known through its original French publication in 1981. In presenting it here in a revised English version, it is to be hoped that it will reach a larger readership than it had previously. As with Dotson’s discussion of the close relationship between administrative and ritual functions, early Tibetan ritual is also central to Imaeda’s chapter in its consideration of funerary practices. The study of Old Tibetan mortuary rites, an especially interesting subfield within the overall cultural history of early Tibet, was essentially pioneered by M. Lalou, whose treatment of PT 1042, concerning royal funerals, paved the way for the documentary investigation of such issues as the rivallry of bon-po and Buddhist, and the competition of ritual specialists for royal patronage.3 Nevertheless, research in this area has often rested on the problematic assumption that the bon and bon-po found in Old Tibetan literary texts were more or less identical to the adherents of the Bon religion, as systematized in about the early eleventh century.4 Among the Dunhuang manuscripts, we find several texts concern-ing, or related to, funeral rites. Most of these contain narratives in which the dead are attended by ritual specialists known as bon or gshen, and often involve the sacrifice of sheep and horses as psychopomp animals that guide the deceased to the land of the dead.5 While some of these texts display no apparent Buddhist influence, others do, and one Buddhist text famously co-opts and transforms early Tibetan funerary rites in order to do away with such practices   3 M. LALOU 1952. Rituel Bon-po des funérailles royals. Journal Asia-tique 240, 339-61. 4 Here we follow Stein’s custom of employing the capitalized term ‘Bon’ to refer to the organized religion, which took shape in approximately the early eleventh century through the work of Shen-chen Klu-dga` and his disciples (D. MARTIN 2001. Unearthing Bon Treasures: Life and Contested Legacy of a Tibetan Scripture Revealer, with a General Bibliography of Bon. Leiden: Brill, 92), and of referring to the ancient Tibetan priests with the italicized, lower case ‘bon’ or ‘bon-po’. These conventions are not intended, however, to prefigure the outcome of the debate concerning the continuity between the earlier and later traditions. 5 See R.A. STEIN 1971.

DOTSON as animal sacrifice.6 This dialogue between Buddhism and local traditions is a common theme throughout Buddhist history, and is particularly pertinent to its Tibetan permutations, where issues of religious identity are so often bound up with dialogic evolution and mimicry.7 Situated within the context of these competing funerary rites, Imaeda’s text, the History of the Cycle of Birth and Death is, he argues, a purely Tibetan composition inspired by one of the master-pieces of Mah\u0002y\u0002na literature, the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0004tra, a work that enjoyed tremendous success in medieval China. As such, the History is based not on the transformation and co-opting of existing non-Buddhist rites, but takes Buddhist canonical tradition as its point of departure, and then popularizes this for a Tibetan audience. The transposition of its story into a Tibetan verse-narrative offers particularly striking evidence of the processes whereby Buddhist ideas and literary motifs were assimilated into the Tibetan cultural milieu. Imaeda’s work is based upon a number of Dunhuang manuscripts, all of which are incomplete. And where they overlap with one another, although the texts generally correspond quite closely, one notices numbers of variants that cannot be readily explained with reference to scribal practice alone. How are we to think about the variation that we find in the extant Old Tibetan documents? It is this question that is taken up in Sam van Schaik’s chapter, applying the conclusions of investigations of medieval oral and literary trans-mission to the study of early Tibetan texts. Van Schaik argues that the simple dichotomy of the oral versus the literary fails to do justice to the complexity of the Tibetan situation, where, just as in medieval Europe, oral practice and writing in various ways were mutually informed and conditioned. In the scenario that van Schaik envisions as having given rise to some of these texts—students taking down the words of their teachers either in person or from memory—the patterns of variation in early Tibetan texts are seen to resemble somewhat those that we find in English traditional ballads. And con-sidering the structured repetitions characterizing a work such as the History of the Cycle of Birth and Death, studied by Imaeda, the comparison with Western ballad traditions seems a compelling one. Though the transmission of Indian Buddhist traditions to Tibet, both under the empire and for many centuries after, has long been a   6 This is PT 239, discussed in R.A. STEIN 1970.

Part three, ‘Chinese Trends in Tibetan Buddhism’, explores this east-to-west movement of texts and ideas. Matthew T. Kapstein’s chapter, ‘The Tibetan Yulanpen jing’, supplies a textual study of the ninth-century Tibetan translation of a famous Chinese Buddhist apocryphon, thus extending a line of research pioneered by the late R.A. Stein. As a close comparison of the Chinese and Tibetan texts reveals, the translator, the famed ’Gos Chos-grub of Dunhuang, gave to this short s\u0003tra, which concerns rites to be performed for the salvation of deceased parents and ancestors, an almost impeccable Indian veneer. Nevertheless, the work’s Chinese antecedents remain evident in several key turns of phrase. The transmission of the Yulanpen jing to Tibet, moreover, suggests that Chinese ‘popular’ Buddhism, and not only the more rarified traditions of learning and meditation, may have played some role in the Tibetan adoption of the foreign religion. As with the History of the Cycle of Birth and Death, in connection with which the question of ‘apocryphal’ Buddhist scriptures is also raised, the action in the Yulanpen jing is driven by the death of one’s parents. The orientation of the two works is similar as well: as Imaeda notes in his conclusions, the History of the Cycle of Birth and Death, in common with the other early Tibetan funerary texts, appears to have been concerned more with transcendent rebirth than with enlightenment and ‘precious human birth’. The same can be said of the Yulanpen jing, in which the Buddha prescribes the proper rites for securing the rebirth of Mulian’s parents and ancestors in heavenly abodes. In Carmen Meinert’s contribution, however, we turn to the refined meditations of Chinese Chan, and their plausible connections with the Tibetan Great Perfection, or Rdzogs-chen. Although this issue has aroused considerable speculation in recent decades, only slight progress has been made in grounding the discussion in solid philological evidence. It is this that Meinert begins to accomplish, through the careful comparison of selected Chan and Rdzogs-chen documents from Dunhuang, demonstrating precisely their complex relationships.

This gave rise to a ritual centralization that embraced a growing ‘national’ pantheon of deities, which, together with the cult of the divine emperor and the seasonal sku-bla rituals performed for the well-being of the emperor and the empire, constituted a major part of the ‘state’ religion. The paired trends of political centralization and ritual centralization are evident in a remarkable, hitherto unpublished Old Tibetan legal document from Dunhuang, IOL Tib J 740. This document consists of two texts, the first a mo divination manual, the second a set of questions and answers concerning legal processes. In this chapter I will demonstrate the relationship between these two texts, and situate them within the Tibetan legal tradition. The bulk of the analysis will focus on the second text, and its contribution to our understanding of the social and political organization of the Tibetan Empire. The chapter is divided into three parts. The first part offers a brief introduction to Old Tibetan law in order to locate the document within this tradition. Part two treats the physical features of the document, its orthography and structure. It also underlines the relationship between the divination manual and the legal text, and considers briefly the role of divination in Tibetan law. The third and final part of the chapter is a thematic analysis of the legal text. The main themes under consideration are debt, loans, interest and corvée labour, women and marriage, the legal status of religious estates and the Tibetan system for drafting and provisioning soldiers. LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE Before moving on to an examination of this document, it will be useful to briefly consider what we know about the legal culture of the Tibetan Empire. The Old Tang Annals (Jiu Tangshu) states of the Tibetans: Their punishments are most severe, and even for small crimes the eyes are scooped out, and the nose cut off, or stripes inflicted with a leather whip. They differ according to caprice, there being no fixed code. They imprison men in holes several tens of feet under the ground, and release them only after two or three years (BUSHELL 1880: 411).

Fragmentary Old Tibetan documents from Dunhuang paint a far more complex picture of legal practices in Tibet. Law, and the ‘good law’ in particular, was a key element of the Tibetan Emperor’s divine inheritance and his earthly legitimation. Simultaneously, Tibetan imperial law, assisted by bureaucracy and a large corps of officials, codified and legislated the emerging foundations of the Tibetan polity. Legislation and the imposition of political order were regarded as essential values in a Tibetan ruler long before they constituted part of the legacy of the religious kings of the empire as eulogized in Tibetan religious histories. Many of the earliest surviving Old Tibetan documents concerning the Tibetan ruler, the Btsan-po, glorify him because of his practice of ‘good (religious) customs and great art of government’ (chos-bzang gtsug-lag che).1 Such considerations are present in numerous passages of the Old Tibetan Chronicle, an epic history whose political imperatives were to eulogize the Tibetan royal line and to idealize and glorify the principles by which the emperors ruled. This entailed a presentation of the Tibetan Emperor as an ordering principle instantiating the ways of heaven upon the earth, and bringing law and order to the Tibetan people. This is evident in the victory songs exchanged by Khri Srong-brtsan (later known as Srong-btsan Sgam-po) (c. 605-649), and his prime minister, Mgar Stong-rtsan, after their defeat of Zhang-zhung. Above, the profound lord, Khri Srong-brtsan. Below, the wise minister Stong-rtsan Yul-zung. Endowed with all the conditions of great majesty (mnga’-thang), the lord, [acting] in the manner of the heavenly mountain gods, and the minister, [acting] in the manner of the earthly majesty (ngam-len), externally increased the polity in the four directions. The internal welfare (kha-bso)2 was abundant and undiminished. They created parity between the high and the low among the black-headed subjects [Tibetans]. They reduced tax fraud and created leisure. They swore [oaths] in the autumn and spring and adhered to this cycle. They gave to the needy and cut out the harmful.   1 For a discussion of these topics, see STEIN 2003 [1985]: 534-39, 560. 2 The term literally means, ‘to nourish mouths’, which translates well enough the English ‘welfare’. The term ‘welfare’ (kha-bso) may also be related to the term khab-so, which is found in the Old Tibetan Annals and other legal and bureaucratic sources, where it is most often taken to mean ‘revenue office’ in a broad sense. Alternatively, kha-bso may just be an error for kha-bsod, meaning ‘good fortune’."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"6 BRANDON DOTSON They employed the powerful and degraded the insolent (sdo-ba).

From the fragmentary legal texts that survived in Dunhuang, it is evident that the Tibetan Empire developed a highly codified system of law that meted out punishments according to the social class of the complainant and that of the defendant in a given case. This is seen most explicitly in PT 1071, a document dealing mainly with blood money or restitution when someone is accidentally shot with an arrow during the course of a hunt. RICHARDSON (1998 [1990]) outlined this text in some detail, and the gradations of punishment according to class are clearly given in his work. The table below is a simplified account that shows the amount of blood money due to each victim according to the victim’s rank. These ranks also include certain of the victims’ kin relations, but this is too complicated to detail here. It should be noted that blood money is not always acceptable: if one of the four great ministers, for example, is killed by someone in ranks eight through ten, the killer is executed, his male descendants are put to death, and his property is confiscated according to the sgor-rabs-gcad death penalty (RICHARDSON 1998 [1990]: 151). Punishment therefore depends both on the class of the assailant and that of the victim. For the sake of clarity, the compensation prices listed in the table below correspond to the price that is paid when the assailant is of an equal or higher rank in relation to the deceased victim.

The break begins with the gtsang-chen, which, like other designations such as ‘silver rank minister’, describes a rank, and not a post. However, gtsang-chen does not appear to indicate a type of insignia. This is evident from PT 1089, where a man appointed ‘great official of fields in general’ (spyi’i zhing-pon ched-po) is described      those of the highest rank ze-ze [䐸䐸 sè sè], the next gold, then gilded silver, then silver, and the lowest copper—which hang in large and small strings from the shoulder, and distinguish the rank of the wearer.’ Cf. PELLIOT 1961: 80. The description corresponds exactly to those found in PT 1071, PT 1072 and PT 1073, save for the omission of brass (ra-gan) between the ranks of silver and copper, and it further indicates that the Tibetan insignia (yig-tshang/ yi-ge) can be considered to be akin to epaulets. We can note that se-se, meaning something like ‘aquamarine’, probably indicates turquoise. Here ‘gilded silver’ (␔䊉倶 j\u0002n tú yín) means ‘silver coated with gold’, and should therefore be rendered more accurately as ‘gold-plated silver’. This corresponds to the Tibetan phra-men, thus clarifying an obscure term.

In the legal document PT 1071, when one from the rank of the turquoise, gold or gold-plated silver ministerial aristocracy (ranks 2-4) is accused of shooting, while hunting, one among the highest rank in the ministerial aristocracy (rank 1), the trial proceeds as follows: Whether [the victim] is killed or not, and there is enmity and it is said that punishment shall never be excused, twelve jurors (gtsang-dkar), with he [the complainant?] himself making thirteen, swear an oath, and the case is decided according to the law of homicide (thong-myi) in the various manuals (dkar-chag). It is not granted that one repay blood money [at this point]. The jurors try him, [and if] the man hit by the   8 ‘LI pu hwar is appointed the great official of fields in general.

As TUCCI (1956: 76), URAY (1972: 67-68), UEBACH (1989: 831) and GNYA’-GONG (2003: 227) have each pointed out, large parts of the ‘Section on Law and State’ relate not to this emperor’s reign, but to the reigns of several other Tibetan Emperors.

If there is no associate, 10,000 srang is the share of the complainant. If the one hit by the arrow does not die, then they impose blood money of 5,000 srang and half is the share of the complainant, the other half that of his associate (’dam-po). If there is no associate, 5,000 srang is the share of the complainant. When one is hit by an arrow and the accused says, ‘it was not my arrow,’ and his denial is not accepted, whether the person hit by the arrow was killed or not, the law of homicide is applied.

Though oaths of loyalty to the emperor and oaths to uphold the Buddhist religion are quite common in Old Tibetan sources, their frequency should not be taken as an indication of triviality. Sacrifice was a key element of Tibetan oath taking rituals, and, if the Tang Annals are to be believed, this sometimes involved the sacrifice of a human being (BUSHELL 1880: 441). This would make such oaths a terrifying experience. In the case above, those who take the oath are the twelve ‘jurors’ (gtsang-dkar), and ‘he himself, making thirteen’ which likely refers to the complainant. This is significant, because the numeric formula ‘twelve plus one, making thirteen’ signifies totality, and thus marks off the ‘jurors’ as an explicit microcosm of Tibetan   12 Read changs. 13 See also RICHARDSON 1998 [1990]: 150."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12 BRANDON DOTSON society.14 Though the outcome of the trial will be compensation from one party to the other, it is tempting to see in the structure of this trial the concept of a crime against society. In this case, the ‘jurors’ are the ones who decide the case and award the requisite blood money. Further, they also seem to have the power to accept or reject any denials of guilt. This case may differ from the others as it occurs during the context of the hunt, which was a state affair sometimes involving thousands of people. However, in as much as the hunt reveals itself as a sort of meta-society involving all strata of Tibetan society in a performative event, the legal clauses may be quite consistent with those found elsewhere.15   14 This same numeric formula of twelve plus one making thirteen is employed in the catalogue of minor kingdoms (rgyal-phran) in PT 1286: ‘The twelve minor kings, with Se-re-khri makes thirteen. The twenty-four ministers, with Skyang-re-gnag makes twenty-five. The twelve strongholds, with Dbu-lde Dam-pa makes thirteen. The twelve territories, with Byang-ka Snam-brgyad makes thirteen.’ (rgyal pran bcu gnyis na / se re khri dang bcu gsum / blon po nyI shu rtsa bzhi na / skyang re gnag dang nyi shu rtsa lnga / mkhar bcu gnyis na / dbu lde dam pa dang bcu gsum / yul bcu gnyIs na / byang ka snam brgyad dang bcu gsum. PT 1286, ll. 22-24, in CD2: pl. 555, CD3: 14). The same formula is found in the recitation of the (twelve plus one equals) thirteen kings in PT 1060, a ritual recitation dealing mainly with horses. ‘The twelve kings, with Se-ra-gri makes thirteen. The twenty-four ministers, with Skyang-re-gnag makes twenty-five. The twelve territories (read yul for ’a yu), with Hod gyi Se-mo gru makes thirteen. The twelve strongholds, with Dbu-ste Ngam-pa-ra makes thirteen.’ (rgya po bcu gnyIs na se ra grI dang bcu gsum blon po nyi shu rtsa bzhi na’ / / skyang re gnag dang nyishu rtsa lnga ’a yu bcu gnyis na’ hod gyi [se] mo gru dang bcu gsum / / mkhar bcu gnyis na’ dbu ste ngam pa ra dang bcu gsum. PT 1060, ll. 94-96, in CD2: pl. 371, CD4: 29). These thirteen minor kingdoms were a vision of the totality of the known world, and were usually invoked as such in a ritual context. The scheme was also used in the formulation of the border taming temples, in which the Jo-khang was supported by three groups of four temples in the cardinal directions (SØRENSEN et al 2005: 172). For more on the significance of the numbers twelve and thirteen as symbols of totality, see DOTSON forthcoming a; STEIN 1961a: 9-10 and EKVALL 1959. 15 The miscellanea at the end of the document also concern the proper butchering and distribution of the animal. The act of dividing the kill and partitioning it among the community reveals which parts of the animal were considered most desirable. This is reminiscent, of course, of sacrifice, where different quarters of the animal are invested with a highly stratified sense of meaning and are matched with the various members of the community according to status. The sacrifice of the animal and the distribution of its body thus establishes commensality, while it also reinforces the social hierarchy. Just as in one of Sad-mar-kar’s songs in the Old Tibetan Chronicle the fallen yak is a symbol of Zhang-zhung, the killed animal and the protocols for its proper distribution are foundational metaphors for Tibetan society and its hierarchies (ALLEN 1978 and MACDONALD"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 13 Another fascinating element of the legal clauses in PT 1071 is the role of the complainant’s ‘associate’ (’dam-po). In his reading of this same Old Tibetan document, Btsan-lha Ngag-dbang Tshul-khrims defines the ’dam-po as ‘one who reveals hidden crimes’ (lkog tu nyes skyon ther ’don byed mkhan), or, in other words, a prosecutor (BTSAN-LHA 1997: 363). Whether Btsan-lha reads too far into this or not, this passage does confirm the existence of legal professionals during the period of the Tibetan Empire. The ‘associate’, who is entitled to half of the compensation payment, would likely not have been a mediator, but someone with knowledge of the law who was able to make a case before the jurors and influence the proceedings through his savoir-faire and eloquence. This is not to say that the ‘associate’ held the occupational equivalent of a modern lawyer or barrister; he may well have simply been an important and influential local figure with some knowledge of the law. Another legal document involving animals, this time of the domestic variety, concerns the protocols for punishing those whose dogs attack passers-by. This text, PT 1073, has also been studied by Richardson, and like the laws surrounding the hunt, it decides punishment according to the social classes of the accuser and the defendant (RICHARDSON 1998 [1989]: 136-37). The only difference is that the document also mentions cases in which the defendant is a woman. Lines 14-15 set out the legal punishment for a woman from silver rank to copper rank who sets a dog on a person holding the more prestigious gold-plated silver (phra-men) rank: If a married woman sets a dog [on someone of gold-plated silver rank] and it kills him, all of whatever was given by her own original paternal family will be awarded as compensation for the killed man. (bud myed khyo mcis/ pa’ zhig / khyi sbod sbod de/ bkum na/ mo ’da’ gdod ma’/ pa mying gyIs/ cis brtsangs16 pa’/ kund gum pa’I stong du stsald do).17 Here it is evident that the woman must give the accuser the bride-wealth that was bestowed on her by her paternal family when she left her paternal home to live with her husband. This of course serves the same end as deciding a case according to social class, as women from upper class families most likely possessed more bride-wealth than those from lower class families. Further, this is but one of the      1980). Like sacrifice, the hunt is a ceremony encoded with the structures of Tibetan society (HAZOD 2000: 218-21). 16 Read brdzangs. 17 See also the translation in RICHARDSON 1998 [1989]: 137."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14 BRANDON DOTSON many instances where Old Tibetan legal texts reveal important information concerning the social structure of the empire. Aside from adding more weight to the assumption that virilocal marriage was common practice in imperial Tibet, this valuable passage also indicates that the p[h]a-mying, that is, father and [elder] brothers, as wife-givers, gave bride-wealth to be taken with the bride to her new husband’s family. That such bride-wealth was still available to the woman to pay the compensation price for her crime indicates that the bride-wealth was likely her own inalienable property and not a gift to her husband or to his family. Two Old Tibetan documents, PT 1075 and IOL Tib J 753, detail the proper punishment for theft. Here the punishment depends not upon the class of the thief (who, as a thief, is probably assumed to be of low class), but upon the class of his victim and the amount stolen. According to IOL Tib J 753, a document edited and translated by THOMAS (1936), a thief was met with banishment or death depending on the value of his haul. The following table shows the punishments that apply when thieves are caught red-handed trying to take riches from a treasury.

Thomas’ translation of pho-reng du spyug as ‘to be banished, after castration’ can probably be disregarded. My provisional translation of pho-reng is uncertain, however, as it is based mostly on analogy with the following clauses and taken therefore to refer not to a condition, but to a degree of distance. The classical Tibetan meaning of pho-reng is ‘bachelor’, so an alternate translation, reading pho-reng du adverbially, would be ‘they banished him alone.’"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 15 (i.e., an outlying area, lam ’bring-por spyug go). 19-10 Ringleader thief is banished to a middle road.

The distinction in the above clauses between the ringleader (ra bgo pa) and his accomplices, and the according differences in punishment, are also found in subsequent Tibetan legal traditions (CASSINELLI AND EKVALL 1969: 169-70).21 The text goes on to detail the punishments for those who steal items of wealth from the authority (bla) down to the ministerial aristocracy (zhang-lon) and commoners (dmangs) (ll. 33-42); punishments for those who steal from the authority (bla) itself (ll. 57-63); and punishments for those who steal from the wealth of an empress, royal lady, princess (btsan-mo lcam-sru dang jo-mo), or ministerial aristocrat, down to that of a commoner (ll. 64-72). The language in the clauses of PT 1075 is almost identical with that of IOL Tib J 753, but the clauses generally deal with much smaller amounts. As this text is so similar in character to IOL Tib J 753, it is not necessary to describe it in any detail here. Both texts are particularly interesting in that they mention a group of royal ladies, the btsan-mo, lcam-sru and jo-mo, apparently in descending order of rank.22 Here again the Old Tibetan legal fragments reveal their sociological value. Aside from these cases that were decided either by a ‘jury’ or according to a legal code, there appear also to have been what one might call ‘capital offenses’. These were decided by the Btsan-po himself. This is demonstrated by the entry in the Old Tibetan Annals for the sheep year 695. Mgar Gung-rton, a member of the Mgar clan with whom the emperor will soon be openly at war, is found to be disloyal, and the text states: ‘They held Mgar Gung-rton’s trial (zhal-ce dbyangs) at Sha-tsal, the Btsan-po made a pronouncement at Nyen-kar Lcang-bu, and Gung-rton was killed’ (sha tsal du mgar gung rton gyI zhal ce dbyangs nas / nyen kar lcang bur btsan poe bkas bcade/ gung rton bkum) (IOL Tib J 750, ll. 69-70; BACOT et al 1940-46: 18, 38). While this demonstrates that the Btsan-po could decide a trial directly, this probably only occurred in cases of particularly great importance. Further, this particular case may be seen as an attempt by Emperor ’Dus-srong (r. 676-704) to demon-   21 See also the discussion of this practice in Old Tibetan law in HOR-DKAR 2003 [1989]: 314-15. 22 On these terms and their possible rank order according to their employment in the Old Tibetan Annals, see UEBACH 1997: 54-55."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 17 strate his authority by not allowing the Mgar clan to decide the case internally. In reading these documents and establishing a typology of legal culture in the Tibetan Empire, it must be borne in mind that these fragmentary documents do not reflect reports or minutes of actual cases. They tell us about Tibetan legal theory, which may not necessarily correspond to legal practice. We cannot say how these laws and practices were implemented and to what extent they pervaded the entire empire. Reading these various legal fragments and noting their consistency, however, one wonders if they were taken from a larger legal manual of the type mentioned in the Old Tibetan Annals, or if, perhaps, they were compiled in order to create such a manual for the local area of Dunhuang. With the benefit of just this cursory look at a few fragments of Old Tibetan legal literature, it is evident that the Tibetan Empire possessed a codified set (or sets) of laws and that many of the elements of subsequent Tibetan legal culture were already present at a very early stage. In the case of compensation for injury and blood money, legal cases take the form of a dispute between two parties that proceeds according to the norms of the relevant legal statutes concerning both the form of the trial and the proper punishment. Likewise, in the case of theft, the legal statutes decide the appropriate punishment, and the thief’s or thieves’ apprehender, in this case the victim, receives the monetary reward of the thief’s or thieves’ wealth after execution or banishment. While it is fair to assume that the government carried out the punishment of the guilty, whether execution or banishment, this is not made explicit in the clauses themselves. In some cases, such as the trial of Mgar Gung-rton, this is explicitly not a dispute between two parties, but a punishment handed down by the emperor himself. Most of these legal practices, particularly blood money, compensation money, and punishment according to the social class of those involved in a dispute, are taken up in later Tibetan legal traditions. As will soon become evident, early Tibetan law shared another common feature with subsequent Tibetan legal systems: trial by divination. CHANCE AND DIVINATION IN EARLY TIBETAN LAW: IOL TIB J 740 The present legal document, IOL Tib J 740, sheds further light on legal practices in imperial Tibet. In particular, it reveals that legal"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"18 BRANDON DOTSON decisions were made in a centralized, systematized arrangement of chance. Before moving on to the contents of the text itself, I will first comment on the form of the text and some of its more interesting orthographic features. The Physical Features of the Document IOL Tib J 740 consists of a long scroll (849cm X 26cm) containing Chinese on the recto and Tibetan on the verso. The Chinese text is the Suvar\u0002aprabh\u0003sottamas\u0004trendrar\u0003jas\u0004tra in 473 columns. The Tibetan side of the scroll contains two separate but related texts, both of them complete. The first, which comprises the first 237 lines, concerns mo divination, and the second consists of 122 lines containing various replies given to legal questions arising from the implementation of a new legal edict. Both texts appear to have been written by the same hand and both employ the same style of punctuation. The text is written in dbu-can script in faded black ink, with no ornamentation, and there is some creasing and fraying near the edges of the scroll. It bears no official seal. The divination text is far more tattered than the legal text, revealing that it was consulted more frequently. The Tibetan texts cover only about three quarters of the verso, while the Chinese takes up nearly the entire recto. There is no Tibetan on the recto. A Note on Orthography Before moving on to a treatment of the contents of this document, I would like to point out some of its orthographic peculiarities. Alternation between aspirated and unaspirated consonants, the use of pe’i or pe in place of pa’i, and the use of the ya-btags are all common, as is the use of reverse gi-gu and the indiscriminate gi-gu (transliterated ‘î’).23 The text employs only gi/gis and gyi/gyis as genetive, instrumentive and agentive particles; there is no use of kyi/kyis following d, b or s suffixes, which are instead followed by gyi/gyis. Another feature of the text is a duplication of syllables appearing at the end of the line: the last syllable of a line is often repeated as the first syllable of the next line where there is no   23 This is described in MILLER 1966: 264. Miller transcribed it ‘i?’ and took it to be a result of laziness on the part of the scribe. On the possible phonological value of the Old Tibetan gi-gu and reverse gi-gu see also Ulving’s review article of MILLER 1966 (ULVING 1972: 209-15) and Miller’s subsequent rebuttal (MILLER 1981)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 19 grammatical reason to do so. This is merely a formal practice, and should not be read as a grammatical duplication. Also, it is very difficult to distinguish the ba from the pa, since the ba is never completely closed at the top. These are all rather commonplace in Old Tibetan, but the use of the tsheg in this text, both double and single, warrants comment. The double tsheg predominates throughout the text, but the single tsheg is usually employed after ng, d, n and r suffixes. Examining the text with this in mind, it is evident that the use of double and single tsheg in the document was not due to the whimsy of the scribe, but followed a specific pattern. This is obviously due to space considerations: those letters with long ‘tails’ are followed by a single, instead of a double tsheg, because the ‘tail’ gets in the way of the lower of the two dots in the double tsheg. This is particularly evident in a few cases where the scribe has placed the two dots of the double tsheg on either side of the ‘tail’ of an n suffix. One problem in transcribing the pattern concerns the ng suffix: since the scribe ends his stroke at the end of the ‘tail’, this creates an ink dot that appears to be a shorthand way of writing the lower of the two dots in the double tsheg. Other samples of early Tibetan writing, such as the Zhol Inscription, employ the double and single tsheg according to a similar pattern. Here, too, this is probably for space considerations, but the writing in IOL Tib J 740 follows the pattern more closely than do most other Tibetan texts. The single tsheg is employed approximately 75% of the time after ng, n, d and r ‘suffixes’, but is used only about 5% of the time otherwise. This is either due to the peculiarities of our scribe’s writing, or it suggests that such a punctuation system had been systematized within certain corners of bureaucratic practice, in which case it may prove to be a useful tool for dating Old Tibetan writing. In presenting the Old Tibetan text, I have transliterated it as it appears in the original documents and made as few corrections as possible in order to retain the older orthographies and irregularities. I have not bothered to correct some of the more obvious liaisons, such as stagi for stag gi, be’i for ba’i, or lagste for lags te. Likewise, I have left untouched most variants between aspirated and unaspirated consonants and also retained attested variant spellings such as sla ~ zla or brtsad ~ brtsan. Glosses that are not otherwise obvious are given in the footnotes, along with unclear readings. The original punctuation is retained in the transliteration of the second text in IOL Tib J 740 at the end of this chapter, but has been removed from the quotations in the body of the chapter for ease of presentation.

The Structure of the Document In the past, most researchers have concentrated on one or the other text in IOL Tib J 740, but never both. Though most of the present analysis concerns the legal text that forms the second part of the document, I wish to demonstrate that the two texts contained in this document are in fact related. Let us turn first to the mo divination manual. To my knowledge, F.W. Thomas was the first to comment on the text, but he mentioned only the first half of the text dealing with mo divination (THOMAS 1957: 140).24 Thomas recognised the structure of the text and its similarity to the other divination documents he analysed: each paragraph was preceded by three sets of small circles, each set containing between one to four circles, indicating the scores of three dice rolls. These dice rolls resulted from throwing three four-sided dice, of the rectangular variety that were found in Miran and Mazar Tagh (STEIN 1907: pl. LXXIV, n. xv. 004). This creates 64 possible combinations, each of which corresponds to one of the entries in the divination book consulted. The mo divination manual could also be consulted with recourse to pebbles, and this is evident in the introductory formula to several passages that begin ‘if the pebble jumps.’.. (rdi phur te) (l. 115).   24 The divination text has since been treated in greater detail in GESANG 2005."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 21 Thomas stated that the mo text in IOL Tib J 740 consisted of 63 paragraphs in 236 lines (THOMAS 1957: 140). In point of fact, there are 62 paragraphs: the mo for the combinations 4 1 2 and 4 3 2 are missing. Further, the text consists of 237 lines, as is evident from the critical editing of Nishida and Ishikawa for OTDO.25 The types of prognostications found in the various paragraphs in IOL Tib J 740 are consistent with those in other Old Tibetan divin-ation texts.26 These were usually consulted for a specific purpose, such as a medical prognosis. The substance of the divination results themselves is rather vague, being generally good or bad, but rarely specified with reference to any given set of circumstances. This is presumably by design, as it gives the diviner some leeway to interpret the results according to the situation. A translation of two examples should suffice to demonstrate the general character of the divinations. 4 1 4: From the mouth of the road god (Lam-lha): You, human! The gods look upon you with compassion! If you have cast this [divination] for a legal trial (zhal-ces), you will be free. If you go trading, your trading will prevail. Not thinking in [your] heart, ‘I am clever,’ you should honour the gods and your heart’s desire will be fulfilled. This is a good prognosis (mo).

When they make a fire in the land of gods, they sing in the land of men. Human—not finding wealth in your house, take to the road, and you will meet with wealth. This is a good prognosis.

It is interesting to note the similarity between the verses of mo prognoses in Old Tibetan divination texts and those of the dice calls used in games of dice (cf. BDE-CHEN 2003: 2ff.).

As in the case of each of these examples, every prognosis (mo) in the text ends with a short statement declaring the quality of the prognosis. This is usually either ‘good’ or ‘bad’, but sometimes ‘very good’, ‘very bad’ or ‘average’ (’bring). The balance is tipped well in favour of a good prognosis, however, with 36 ‘good’ prognoses against only thirteen ‘bad’ prognoses.

The divinities mentioned are striking in that they tie together the gods of the centre with those of the periphery. The territorial divinity of the ’On region, ’O-lde Gung-rgyal (l. 70) is listed, as is that of Yar-lung, Yar-lha Sham-po (ll. 163, 202). So too is Thang-lha Ya-bzhur (l. 22), the mountain deity of ’Phan-yul and the areas surrounding the Gnyan-chen Thang-lha range. These are all well-known mountain gods in central Tibet, but some lesser known gods such as Sha-med Gangs-dkar (l. 209), Lhe’u-rje Zin-tags (ll. 2, 104, 155) and Sla-bo Sla-sras (l. 226) also deliver prognoses in the text. The first two of"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 25 these lesser deities are called upon as witnesses in the song of Emperor ’Dus-srong (reigned 685-704) in the Old Tibetan Chronicle (BACOT et al 1940-46: 119, 164), and these two mountain deities were later incorporated into the pantheons of the ‘twelve protectors of the doctrine/chthonic goddesses’ (brtan-ma bcu-gnyis) and the ‘thirteen mountain deities associated with the Btsan-po’ (mgur-lha bcu-gsum), respectively.29 The god Sla-bo Sla-sras is mentioned as ‘lord’ (rje) Bla-bo Bla-sras in the Dunhuang ritual text IOL Tib J 734 (ll. 88, 100, 165; THOMAS 1957: 64-67, 80-85). He is also known from later sources: in KhG, Lha-bo Lha-sras was among the twelve ‘intelligent ones’ (shes-pa can) who saw the first Tibetan Emperor, Gnya’-khri Btsan-po, des-cend from the peak of Lha-ri Gyang-tho and arrive at Lha-ri Rol-po Btsan-thang Sgo-bzhi (KhG: 159). In a parallel narrative in Lde’u, the god Sgam Lha-bo Lha-sras welcomes the new Tibetan sovereign on one of the stages of his journey from heaven to earth (Lde’u: 236; KARMAY 1998 [1994]: 302. The other deities mentioned in the divination manual are lesser known or unattested, but special mention must be made of the god Dbyar-mo-thang (l. 86), no doubt connected with the site of the same name in eastern Tibet.30 As detailed by MACDONALD (1971: 271-87), Old Tibetan divination texts vary greatly: while some show a marked Buddhist influence, with prognoses coming from the mouths of bodhisattvas, other texts seem to reflect an ancient Tibetan tradition with little or no discernible Buddhist influence. The current text seems to fall into the latter category. The text explicitly mentions bon-po four times (ll. 14, 54, 111, 206). In one example, the prognosis states ‘it is inappropriate for one skilled in bon not to perform bon; this is a bad prognosis’ (phon mkhas pas bon ma byas na myi rung te mo nganto/, l. 54). This does not necessarily identify the author(s) of this divination text as bon-po, but at least suggests that it came from a   29 For the brtan-ma bcu-gnyis, see NEBESKY-WOJKOWITZ 1998 [1956]: 181-98.

According to GNYA’-GONG (1993: 390, n. 15), Lhe’u-rje Zin-brang is one of the thirteen mountain deities associated with the Btsan-po (mgur-lha bcu-gsum).

Aside from Thomas, la Vallée Poussin also noted the existence of IOL Tib J 740. In his Catalogue of Tibetan texts in the Stein collection of the then India Office Library, LA VALLÉE POUSSIN (1962: 234) characterizes the first part of the document as mo divination, and the second part as a ‘document about taxes’. IOL Tib J 740 then seems to have gone all but unnoticed until Richardson remarked on the second part of the document in his 1989 article, ‘Early Tibetan Law Concerning Dog-Bite’. There he rightly states that the document ‘gives details of the proper decision, according to a new set of regulations, in cases concerning such matters as loans, taxation, marital disputes and so on’ (RICHARDSON 1998 [1989]: 135). Richardson studied the document in further detail, but only a partial translation is found in his papers.32 The second part of the document is entitled StagI lo’i bka’I sho byung be’i sho tshIgs gyI zhus lan, or ‘Replies concerning sho-tshigs from the tiger year sho edict’. The text contains replies given to questions that concern property, loans, interest, marriage, monasteries and the conscription of troops. These issues are spread out over eleven ‘clauses’, or sets of questions and answers, and 122 lines. In each clause, the structure is the same: a question is submitted from the minister of the exterior (phyi-blon) to the judges of the court retinue (pho-brang ’khor gyi zhal-ce-pa), who report back with their decisions. In each case, it is always a question of whether a matter can be decided ‘by means of sho’. The final words of the petition thus typically end, ‘Do we decide by means of sho or not—how do you command?’ (shos gcad dam myI gcad ji ltar ’tshal) (IOL Tib J 740, ll. 7, 69-70). This underlines the pivotal issue concerning the interpretation and translation of this text: the definition of the term sho. While the most common meaning of the word is ‘dice’, Richardson, perhaps due to the repeated mention in the text of loans (bu-lon, skyin), interest   31 On my use of the terms Bon and bon-po, refer to n. 4 of the Preface. 32 Drafts of a partial transliteration and partial translation are kept in the Richardson papers at the Bodleian Library under the catalogue number MS.

In doing so, he may have had in mind compound terms such as sho-gam (JÄSCHKE 1998 [1881]: 563) and sho-khral (ZHANG et al 1998 [1984]: 2866), both meaning ‘customs’, ‘duty’, or, in a looser sense, ‘tax’. While I initially applied this reading in my own attempts to translate the text, it became apparent that this reading of sho was untenable. The language of the document is quite obscure due not only to its antiquity, but also to its legal milieu. It employs a specialized legal vocabulary, and includes phrases in a legal jargon that is very difficult to translate. Nonetheless, the grammar is generally consist-ent. In the phrase shos gcad, sho is in the instrumentive case, so the petitioners are asking whether or not they should gcad (cut, decide) by means of sho. To read sho as tax would render the phrase ‘to cut/ decide by means of tax’. For this to make sense in context, it would have to mean ‘to apply tax’. This would be a rather unusual turn of phrase, and such a translation stretches the bounds of Tibetan grammar far more than the obvious reading, ‘decide by means of dice’. The veracity of this reading can be further demonstrated in the context of some examples from the text. Clause IV (ll. 251-58) concerns the legislation of loans and interest. The passage is first given in transliteration, with only minor editing, and then translated in two separate ways. The first translation reads sho as ‘dice’, and the second translates sho as ‘tax’. bla ’ogI bu londu gyur pe’i rnams shos myî gcado zhes byung na / bu lon gyi / gyur ded pe’i mchid nas nI gyur yang bu lon shos myI gcad pe’i nang ’du ’du /khrin ma lags / pas bka’ shos myI gcad par gsol ces mchI / chags pe’i khungs po’i mchId nas ni bla ’ogI bu lon shos myI gcad par ’pyung gis / gyur shos myi gcad par yang myi ’pyung la / gyur ces bgyI pa’ bu lon dngos sho ma lagste / sngar bu lon dusu ma phul pe’i nongs pe’i chad par gyur pas / ’dI yang nyes che phra [pa] ’dra pas / chad pa ’gum spyug man cad la thug pa / thugs dpag mdzad pe’i bka’ shos bcad par gsol ces ’byung ’ba’di rnams gang ltar ’tshal / kha mar las byung ba’ shos gcad par ’tshol cIg // (IOL Tib J 740, ll. 251-58).

[Answer:] According to the red notch [instructions]: apply the tax! The reading of sho in this passage determines the manner of loan repayment. Reading sho as dice, the lender (gyur ded-pa, lit. ‘the one pursuing the interest’) wants to be repaid without recourse to dice, while the borrower (chags-pa’i khungs-po, lit. ‘the source of the loan’), wants the interest to be decided by means of dice. This is obviously to the advantage of the borrower, as interest, which is generally applied to late payment, is usually decided according to a   34 The use of the verb ’ded in this construction seems to be parallel to its use in the modern nominalized compound bun ’ded, short for lo-bun ’ded-pa, meaning ‘loan collector’ (GOLDSTEIN 2001: 723)."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 29 contract (TAKEUCHI 1995: 46-91), and a good roll of the dice could conceivably free the borrower from having to pay any interest at all.35 Further, the debtor requests that his punishment for criminally overdue loans be decided in the same manner, perhaps also in hopes of the dice setting him free. On the other hand, if one reads sho in this passage as ‘tax’, and shos gcad as ‘to tax’, then the debtor’s request is exceedingly odd, since he is asking to be taxed for the interest he owes. It further beggars belief that he should request to be punished for his outstanding debts according to a tax code that may have him banished or executed. This being the case, if we assume that the borrower is not voicing self-destructive impulses, but is acting in his own self-interest, then the context stands together with the grammar to support the translation of sho as ‘dice’, and shos-gcad as ‘to decide by means of dice’. The veracity of this reading is further underlined by a passage in clause VII (ll. 269-86), where disputes concerning an unmarried woman’s chastity are decided by means of dice (infra, 42-46). Read-ing such a passage in terms of tax would render it nonsensical. We can therefore return to the title of the text, which is ‘Replies concerning the dice statutes (sho-tshigs) from the tiger year dice edict (bka’-sho)’. It is evident from the text itself that the dice statutes indicate when it is appropriate to use dice to resolve a legal matter. The questions and answers that comprise the second part of IOL Tib J 740 concern those matters that were left sufficiently unclear in these statutes so as to warrant a formal petition. This could be confirmed, of course, were the text of the tiger year dice edict ever to come to light. It should be noted here that the clauses of ‘Replies concerning the dice statutes from the tiger year dice edict’ do not imply that dice were employed only in instances where the facts of the case were disputed or unclear. The clauses plainly include instances where dice decided disputed facts, the final   35 Takeuchi noted the formula according to which failure to pay on time doubled the amount to be paid: ‘in case [the borrower] should fail to repay by that time or if he tries to conspire [not to pay, the amount of payment] shall be doubled’ (dus der ma phul lam gya gyu zhig ’tshal na / gcig la gnyis su [-] bsgyur te) (IOL Tib J 1141, ll. 5-6; TAKEUCHI 1995: 199, 200). This formula is often followed by a statement to the effect that the lender can then foreclose on the borrower’s possessions. The statement usually begins, dngos bsgyur dang bcas-pa or dngos gyur dang bcas-pa. Takeuchi went some way towards defining this phrase (TAKEUCHI 1995: 52), and it is evident that it means ‘[the loan] itself, with that which it has become (bsgyur)’. In other words, ‘the loan, with interest (gyur)’."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"30 BRANDON DOTSON outcome of the case, and the punishment of a guilty party. In every clause of the text, the local magistrates ask how to decide a case or a point in a case according to the dice statutes of a dice edict. Therefore they had access to legal norms that prescribed dice as a legal means, but the norms were insufficient in these particular cases due either to their complexity or to the inadequacy of the dice statutes in the tiger year dice edict. That the magistrates had access to such norms is evident in their references to previous dice edicts, so the confusion seems simply to have been with the new edict. Having demonstrated that this legal text does indeed concern whether or not to decide cases, and aspects of cases, according to the roll of the dice, its connection with the mo divination text is now evident: when a case was decided by means of dice, it was done with recourse to the mo divination text in the first part of the scroll. It is unclear, however, whether or not the mo divination text, like the replies to questions concerning the dice edict, was issued from the court (pho-brang). Though they appear to be written in the same hand, the document bears no seal, and is most likely the copy of an official document. Therefore, the possibility remains that the divination manual was not a standardized set of prognoses (mo) issued from the centre by imperial officials. This conclusion seems all the more likely considering the fact that the manual’s prognoses are supremely generic, and that they refer also to pebbles, which, like dice, were used for divination. It seems, then, that in deciding cases, the local magistrates pragmatically employed a generic divination manual, and not an official manual issued from the court. In either scenario, however, the Tibetan Empire did create a standardized method of deciding the guidelines for punishment. Furthermore, whether the gods in this divination manual who give voice to the various prognoses were assembled on an ad-hoc basis as a sort of organic, informal pantheon, or represented a standard set issued from the centre, this divination manual unifies many of the telluric deities of Tibet for the purpose of governance and the rule of law, and stands as a witness to a process of ritual centralization whereby Tibet created a ‘national’ pantheon. On Dice and Divinity The use of dice and other games of chance in deciding legal matters is well-known in the more recent history of Tibet. In his study of homicide disputes in Sakya, for example, HENDERSON (1964: 1103) mentions a case where the accused was forced to roll dice on the skin"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 31 of a freshly killed yak, and, winning the roll, was allowed to go free. CASSINELLI AND EKVALL (1969: 176-77) apparently describe this same trial, but in their analysis it appears that the case was only decided in this manner because the facts of the case could not be established with certainty. FRENCH (1995: 134-35) also mentions two cases, one in Lhasa in the 1930s concerning inheritance, the other in southwest Tibet concerning a loan, where the disputed facts of the case were decided by rolling dice. In the modern legal cases mentioned by Henderson and French, both state that recourse to dice was not considered to be a matter of mere chance, but was believed to reveal the will of the gods. There are numerous other instances where chance is employed in order to resolve what might be viewed as official matters. One well-known procedure for choosing between candidates for a given office is to write the candidates’ names on pieces of paper, sometimes within a ball of dough, put them into a bowl or urn and pick one at random to reveal the successful candidate.36 In some instances, as in the selection of the caretaker of Khra-’brug Monastery, the name was chosen in front of the image of a divinity (SØRENSEN et al 2005: 109-10, n. 282), and in other cases various gods were called upon as witnesses. Ramble analyzed a similar process in the Tibetan-ethnic village of Te in Nepal’s Mustang district, whereby the village headman is elected by means of an elaborate ritual game that effectively randomizes the outcome (RAMBLE 1993: 292-95). In a brilliant analysis of this ‘game’ of chance, Ramble reveals that the role of divine intervention in the selection, according to the participants themselves, was secondary at best. RAMBLE (1993: 297) concludes that the ‘evidence leaves us with no option but to conclude that it is the game itself which decides. People nominate certain candidates, and the gods are called as witnesses to the decision, but the selection is made by nothing other than the game.’ A similar process may be at work in the legal procedures revealed in the present document: although the general prognosis and legal decision (but not the specific sentence or terms) often comes from the mouth of a divinity, the prognosis, whether it comes from a divinity or not, is always the result of the roll of the dice.

In either case, it is a mechanism through which figures of authority legitimate their decisions by means of placing agency outside of themselves. The role of the local magistrate who presides over the decision is therefore that of a caretaker or assistant who mediates the decision handed down by the dice. THE CONTENTS OF THE LEGAL TEXT Having discussed the nature of the two documents comprising IOL Tib J 740, demonstrated their relationship, and located them in relation to Tibetan legal practice, we can now examine in some detail the contents of the second text, ‘Replies concerning the dice statutes from the tiger year dice edict’. As mentioned above, the legal document contains eleven sets of answered questions and 122 lines. The contents are important not only for what they tell us about Tibetan imperial legal procedure and the law itself, but for the assumptions they reveal about the nature of Tibetan society at the time. Some of the clauses, in particular the clause treating the legal status of monastic estates and monastic property and the clause dealing with the provisioning of soldiers, clarify important issues relating to the day to day functioning of the empire, and will therefore be analyzed in some detail. The text’s eleven sets of questions and answers may be sum-marized as follows: ‘Replies concerning the dice statutes from the tiger year dice edict’. I. (ll. 239-42) Relates to the precedence of the statutes of the tiger year dice edict over earlier dice edicts. II. (ll. 242-46) Relates to the applicability of the dice edict to land, persons and households that were previously not subject to [decisions through] dice edicts. III. (ll. 246-51) Relates to the correct procedure for compensating a husband when a woman breaks off a marriage and returns to her natal home. IV. (ll. 251-58) Relates to a dispute between lender and borrower. V. (ll. 258-63) Relates to loans that have been secretly re-lent or resold by the borrower. VI. (ll. 263-67) Relates to deposited securities (bzhag-btam). VII. (ll. 268-86) Relates to the proper legal procedure when a married woman is stolen from her husband or when an unmarried woman is kidnapped."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 33 VIII. (ll. 286-303) Treats the proper procedure for punishing a messen-ger who loses horses, wages, etc., entrusted to him. IX. (ll. 303-20) Relates to loans made by a monastic estate and the legal status of the property of a temple or monastery. X. (ll. 320-31) Concerns proper legal procedure when an estate loses its harvest to hail and cannot fill its quotas to the army or to a garrison. XI. (ll. 331-59) Concerns the proper provisioning of soldiers by the estates, and punishment for their failing to send the required prov-isions. The structure of each clause is the same: in the first part the problem is summarized and a question submitted, and in the second part an answer is given. The text is composite in nature, since it consists of answers given by judges of the court retinue (pho-brang khor gyi zhal-ces-pa) to numerous questions submitted by petition through the minister of the exterior (phyi-blon). The only continuity in these questions and answers is that they all relate to the correct implementation of the statutes of a new edict issued in a tiger year. As a result, the topics addressed are far ranging, and move from matters of debt, loans and interest to wife capture, monastic estates and troop conscription. Far from being a set of ‘frequently asked questions’, these clauses appear to have arisen organically from numerous disputes. The manner in which these decisions are taken is instructive, as it demonstrates a high degree of legal and administrative centralization. Two ‘addenda’ (yan-lag/yal-ga) in the text clarify the process by which these sets of questions and answers were created. In both cases, they precede the text of the decision dispatched from the court. From a supplement (yan-lag) to the dice statutes: decision in response to a petition dispatched (dgyigs) from the place [seat] of the exterior minister to the place of the judge[s] (zhal-ces-pa) of the court retinue: (sho tshigs gyI yan lag las / pho brang khor gyi zhal ces pe sar [nas] zhus pa / phyI lon sa nas dgyIgste zhus pa / mchId gyis bcade zhus pe’i zhus lan /) (ll. 268-69). From a supplement (yal-ga) to the dice statutes of the tiger37 year: decision dispatched from the place of the judge(s) of the court retinue to the place of the minister of the exterior: ([rta’I] sta lo’I sho tshigs gyI yal ga’ las pho brang khor gyI zhal ces pas / [phyi blon sar] zhal   37 ‘Horse’ (rta) was crossed out and replaced, below the line by sta, presumably for tiger (stag)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34 BRANDON DOTSON ce’i pe’I sa nas zhus las / phyI blon sar dgyigste mchId gyis bcad pa / /) (ll. 273-75). These clauses locate the decisions contained in the text at the Tibetan court (pho-brang), the (mobile) centre of the Tibetan Empire. Therefore the clauses can be taken to represent the legal positions of judges of the central Tibetan imperial government, and cannot be dismissed as representative only of the local area from which each legal query arose. Presumably these cases were brought first to local magistrates, who had trouble with the cases and submitted them to the minister of the exterior, who in turn submitted the case to the judges of the court retinue for a final decision. The clauses in the text are composed of these decisions, which, as is often the case in such official correspondence, open with the original question before moving on to the decision.38 The document is therefore a testament to the legal and bureaucratic centralization of the Tibetan Empire: matters arising on the periphery are decided at the centre. The nature of the decisions is important as well. In most cases, the correspondence has to do with the applicability of the dice edict to specific legal cases. Here, as mentioned above, the local magistrate probably had some room to negotiate the terms of a given legal sentence, as the dice presumably decide only who wins a case, or determine a certain point in the case, and not the terms of the settlement. One is tempted to see here the sort of dynamic between centralization and decentralization that held sway in early twentieth century Tibet, where the central administration was content to devolve nearly all legal authority to local administrators, provided that taxes arrived on time (GOLDSTEIN 1971b: 180). In other clauses among the ‘Replies’, however, the judges of the court retinue hand down full legal decisions. Further, these decisions do not concern only murder or treason, but include more mundane affairs such as marriage and separation (ll. 246-51). This demonstrates a very high degree of legal centralization that was never again matched by any subsequent Tibetan administration. Further, it demands that we rethink to some extent the theory that the exercise of ‘soft power’ and devolution of authority to the periphery by subsequent Tibetan governments was due to long-standing Tibetan ideology, rather than to straightforward impotence. This discussion brings up another important question: who were the local magistrates who made these decisions according to the   38 See, for example, PT 1089, an answer to a petition concerning the order of rank in Sha-cu, i.e., Dunhuang (LALOU 1955)."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 35 guidelines relayed by the minister of the exterior from the judges of the Tibetan court? Their identity or rank is never mentioned explicitly. It is worth noting, however, that in their recourse to mo divination they employ technologies taken directly from a ritualist milieu: the methodology of the diviner in making a prognosis, medical or otherwise, and that of the local magistrate in deciding a legal case were virtually identical in form and content. Considering mo divination, in which the prognoses often issue ‘from the mouth of a god’ (lha’i zhal nas), Macdonald contends that the prognoses came from mediums in whom the gods and spirits incarnated, and through whom they spoke (MACDONALD 1971: 275, 285). Whether these divinations truly involved possession or not, the question remains: was the use of mo divination in a legal context an administrative appropriation of ritual technology, or evidence that ritualists occupied administrative positions as local leaders? Whether the overlap in ritual technologies between the bon or gshen diagnosing an illness and the local magistrate deciding a legal case indicates that these roles were united in one person is far from clear. That the roles of ritualist, healer and administrator should overlap in a Tibetan context, however, is by no means a radical proposition, and warrants consideration. The questions and answers in some clauses can be very straightforward, but problematic in those clauses where multiple issues are addressed by more than one authority. The decisions issued from the judges of the court retinue most often open with the phrase kha-mar las or myig-mar las, and this reveals that the medium through which these decisions were issued was a wooden slip. The kha-dmar/kha-mar or ‘red notch’ refers to the type of notched wooden slip in which instructions concerning judicial decisions were sent. This is made clear in a passage of the ‘Section on Law and State’ in Lde’u that concerns the types of wooden slips appropriate to various legal judgments: As for the three legal slips (zhal-lce’i byang-bu),39 the ‘good undefiled’ (zang-yag) adheres to the testimony of the complainant (blo-yus), and states that he is honest. The striped middle (sked-khra) [slip] judges the lawsuit as false, and states that the complainants’ wealth is to be confiscated. The red-notched (kha-dmar) slip states that instructions are attached (kha-dmar ’dogs). Those are the three slips.   39 The corresponding Classical Tibetan term, zhal-lce, may be a folk etymology of the Old Tibetan term zhal-ce/ zhal-ces. Here the zhal in the term zhal-ce/-ces may well be related to ’jal/bcal/gzhal/’jol, ‘weigh, assess, ponder, judge’."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"36 BRANDON DOTSON (zhal lce’i byang bu gsum ni/ zang yag bya ba blo yus kyi shags dang sbyar nas drang por gcod pa la zer ro/ sked khra ni zhal lce yon por gcod gcod pa la zer te/ blo yus kyi nor za ba la zer ro/ byang bu kha dmar ni kha dmar ’dogs pa la zer te/ byang bu gsum mo. Lde’u: 262).40 It is evident that the red notched slip and the attendant instructions are used only in cases where there is no clear verdict for or against a complainant, but a more nuanced decision. The same passage from Lde’u also mentions a black dot (mig-nag) wooden slip, but unfortunately has nothing to say on the topic of the ‘red dot’ (mig-mar) slip. The ‘red dot’ that is also mentioned in some clauses of ‘Replies’ is most likely also a type of slip used to relay instructions regarding a legal decision, but I can observe no qualitative difference between the type of content in the red dot instructions versus the content of the red notch instructions. In any case, both ‘red notch’ and ‘red dot’, though ostensibly names of the types of wooden slips themselves, appear to be used metonymically to refer to the information the slips contain and perhaps even to the offices that issue them. Turning to an analysis of the clauses themselves, since the document is rather long and unwieldy, it will be preferable to sum-marize the document’s more interesting aspects by theme rather than offering here a full translation. Loans, Interest, Debt and Corvée Labour Many of the clauses in the document deal with loans and interest and whether or not they are subject to a decision by dice. The above translation of clause IV (ll. 251-58) already demonstrated a case in which the borrower wishes the interest on a loan to be decided by means of dice, while the lender, presumably favouring the terms of   40 Despite the fact that KhG relied heavily on Lde’u as a source for its ‘Section on Law and State’, the passage on legal slips quoted above is left out of the ‘Section on Law and State’ in KhG, and placed further on in KhG’s narrative in a chapter devoted to the reign of Khri Srong-lde-brtsan (reigned 756-c.800). There it makes up one of the reforms created by minister Mgos Khri-bzang Yab-lhag. The passage is evidently lifted from Lde’u, but contains an explanatory gloss on the meaning of kha-dmar. ‘The [slip] that adheres to the complainants’ testimony, and finds it to be honest is called the ‘good undefiled’ (zang-yag). The one that finds it false is called the ‘striped middle’ (sked-khra). The slip that has attached instructions (kha-dmar ’dogs-pa) concerning [who is] right and wrong is called the ‘red notch’ (kha-dmar). Those are the three legal slips.’ (blo yus kyi shags dang sbyar nas drang por gcod pa la zang yag zer/ yon por gcod pa la rked khre zer/ bden rdzun gyi kha dmar ’dogs pa la byang bu kha dmar zer te zhal ce’i byang bu gsum mo.

As remarked already, adjudicating such a case with dice is obviously to the advantage of the borrower, as interest is usually decided according to a contract, and a good dice roll could conceivably free the borrower from having to pay any interest at all. While in clause IV the judges’ decision went in favour of the borrower, and allowed the case to be decided by dice, in clause V (ll. 258-63) the judges side with the lender by honouring the terms of the original contract. [Question:] [Where] there are crimes and violations, or one subsequently parcels [a loan] (‘og-dum bgyis-pa) and so forth, and the lender (bu-lon chags-pa)41 makes an accusation, based on [the contract with] a swearer’s seal (dam-rgya), [that the borrower] made a subsequent sale [of the loan], but the borrower (chags-pa’i khungs-po) requests that it be decided by means of dice because he has sold [the loan] or loaned the item itself, and the lender (ded-pa) requests that, as the [contract with a] swearer’s seal is confirmed, it not be decided by means of dice, what is to be done with these two positions?

One difficulty regarding loans in the text is the phrase bla-’og gi bu-lon, provisionally translated ‘loan under the authority’. Alternatively, bla-’og gi bu-lon could indicate ‘a loan, [whether between those of] high or low [rank]’, and indeed TAKEUCHI (1995: 148-49, 264-65) interprets bla-’og in this way in two of the contracts he translates. Another possibility is that the phrase means ‘a loan [from] a superior [to] an inferior’. Due to the fact that bla-’og gi bu-lon is used not only in general descriptions, but apparently to describe the quality of a particular loan, only the first or last of these three interpretations can be correct. And if it is indeed the first inter-pretation that proves correct, this ‘loan under the authority’ is not a direct loan from the Tibetan administration, but a loan between two parties where the administration has jurisdiction. This jurisdiction is exercised in the present document by deciding whether or not the interest on a loan can be decided by means of dice, and not according to the terms of the original loan contract. This is also apparent in the case of a debt incurred by a man when he loses horses and goods entrusted to him, apparently for corvée labour, as in clause VIII (ll. 286-303). The first part of the clause describes a situation in which a man has lost goods entrusted to him, and asks how he is to be punished. The first part of a long reply is as follows: [Answer:] According to the red dot (myIg-mar) [instructions], [the debt] is incurred by the messenger, and although according to the replies of the horse year the legal punishment for the debt from his loan"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 39 is decided by means of dice, according to the official law (bka’-khrIms) debts up until the present having been repaid (sbyang), if there is interest on something lost or destroyed, as it is interest on a loan under the authority (bla ’og), it is proper that it not be decided by means of dice. According to the reply made by the judge, concerning the so-called ‘there being nothing but that in the summary’ [statute], even if what is lost reappears (yong), it is not there [i.e., ‘it does not matter’] (ma mchis). Concerning the dead, even if it is given up by the waters (chab gyis ’tshal), or by the jackals (khyI lcang gIs ’tshal), and even if what is lost is there [present], whether there is interest or not on what is dead or lost, summarize it in what is to be repaid (sbyang-ba), but it is not necessary to investigate whether or not it is in the summary (mdo-ris). myIg mar las phor phog pa dang g.yar pe’i skyIn khrIn / rta’i lo’i zhu lan las shos gcad par ’byung / gIs gyang/ bka’ khrIms gyis skyin ba’i ’da’ bar ’byung pas sbyangste gum stordu gyur na / bla ’ogI bu londu ’gyur pas / shos myi gcad pe’i rIgs / zhal ce pas zhus pa las mdo rIs mchis mchIs pa ma mchIs zhes bya ba’ nI stor pa la nI yong yang ma mchIs / gum ba’ la yang chab gyIs ’tshal pa dang / khyI spyang gIs ’tshal pa dang / stor pa yang mchIs pa zhîg mchIs na / gum stordu gyur tam ma gyur pa’ nI spyang be’i nang du ’du bas mdo rIs mchIs ma mchis pa myI rma be’i rIgs / / (IOL Tib J 740, ll. 295-302). This is an interesting passage, as it demonstrates that the ‘official law’ (bka’-khrims) held precedence over the statutes of the dice edict. Here it is a matter of compensating someone whose goods and horses were lost after he entrusted them to a messenger. The application of the dice edict would allow the messenger the possibility of not having to repay his debt, but the ‘official law’ effectively prevents that, and therefore sides firmly with the complainant. Here the refusal to use dice may be due to it being a ‘loan/ debt under the authority’, namely, as administration-sponsored corvée labour over which the authorities wished to exert full legal control. This meaning is also supported by the opening to clause IV: ‘Where it is said that interest on those loans that come under the authority (bla ’og) is not decided by means of dice.’ (supra, 28). Of course that decision goes on to prescribe dice to settle the matter, but, as detailed already, the cases that make up this document are all by nature less than routine. In dealing with the man’s punishment for losing goods and horses, clause VIII specifically states that punishment applies even to cases where the loss is accidental: ‘concerning the loss, even if it was not"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"40 BRANDON DOTSON the fault of men.’ (stor lta bo myIs nongs pa yang ma lags. l. 291). This clause therefore serves as an example of how those providing corvée labour were held responsible for any losses of transport animals or merchandise, a practice echoed in early twentieth-century Tibet, where villagers carrying out corvée labour had to pay for any breakage or loss to the goods they carried (GOLDSTEIN 1971a: 17). The second paragraph of the reply, which applies a very literal and legalistic approach to the summary (mdo-ris) of the lost goods, seems to serve as a protection against messengers who steal the goods entrusted to them. Though this is a very difficult passage containing a few obscure metaphors, the meaning seems to be essentially this: once the legal proceedings concerning lost property have begun, no further evidence may be admitted, and the court will only consider the original claims. This appears to serve two purposes: it prevents the complainant from continuously adding to the list of lost goods, and, perhaps more importantly, it establishes that the case will proceed as before even if the man who initially lost the goods somehow finds them. The latter presumably occurred in a number of cases where men stole goods entrusted to them, and later, facing legal proceedings, succumbed to fear and handed them over. A passage in another Dunhuang document, PT 1290, also concerns the proper conduct of messengers and the types of seals that they employ. Both MACDONALD (1971: 325) and STEIN (1984: 263-64) analyzed this difficult passage and noted its relevance to the Tibetan Empire’s system for relaying information. Of particular interest to the above clause, the passage in PT 1290 states that messengers can be put to death (sod du rchugste) for misconduct (STEIN 1984: 263). The above clause and the passage in PT 1290 indicate that the Tibetan Empire operated a sophisticated system for relaying both information and goods. In summary, it appears from the clauses reviewed above that the Tibetan administration generally did not apply the dice edict to those cases where there was already a firm contract between two parties detailing the terms of the loan. In matters ‘under the authority’ (bla-’og) of the Tibetan administration, such as corvée labour, the judges, as one might expect, acted in the interest of the administration and the transportation network. Women and Marriage ‘Replies concerning the dice statutes from the tiger year dice edict’ contains two clauses that deal with women and marriage. The first,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 41 clause III (ll. 246-51), is short and particularly illuminating on the legislation of marriage. [Question:] According to previous dice edicts, when a girl breaks off a marriage (bag-rgod)44 and until now resides in her paternal home and stays there, and the husband (khyim-thab) asks that she not be sent [back], and the parents and [the girl] herself at first agree but it now comes about, however, that they do not agree and he requests that a substitute (glud) be given, how is it to be given?

His request for a substitute wife is analogous to an investor’s demand to be ‘made whole’ following an unexpected loss. The legal resol-ution—that his in-laws need not supply a substitute, but must return him his wife—suggests a ‘for better or for worse’ approach to marriage. This approach to a man’s wife as inalienable property is not so surprising, given that we have records from Dunhuang of marriage by sale (gnyen-tshongs) (TAKEUCHI 1995: 162-63). Among Tibetan nomads there are also legal customs that govern such situations. Describing legal customs among Tibetan nomads in Rdza-chu-kha, Mgo-log, Gser-thang and elsewhere, Nam-mkha’i Nor-bu notes the custom of ‘restitution for mo-sha’. This term, mo-sha, is used to refer to a situation where a girl breaks off a marriage and returns to her parents, generally after three days. Nor-bu attributes this mainly to the nomadic custom of arranged marriage, which leads to situations where the bride and groom have never met before their marriage. As recompense for mo-sha, the bride’s family   44 This meaning is not entirely certain, but is suggested by the context.

This is one of the most difficult clauses in the text, and it should be stressed that the translation is provisional. A major part of the clause concerns ’tsho and ’tshos-pa, which I have rendered in terms of its sexual denotation, and not as ‘livelihood’, or any of its other possible meanings.47 From a supplement (yan-lag) to the dice statutes: decision in response to a petition dispatched (dgyigs) from the place [seat] of the exterior minister to the place of the judge[s] (zhal-ces-pa) of the court retinue: in previous dice edicts, if a married woman is stolen or captured by another, as regards her sexual activity (’tshos-pa) up to the present, is she returned to the care of her previous husband (bdag-po), or, not being separated from her [present] sexual activity, is a human loan to be given (myi skyin stsal)? How do you command? According to the replies concerning the dice statutes of the horse year, if the woman’s husband and owner are unable to secure her sale, and the thieves and abductors and so forth are unable, the judicial punishment of her present defilers (’tshos-pa rnams)48 will be decided by means of dice. As for the woman herself, do not subsequently separate her from her sexual activity, but leave her with her defilers. There are no dice for men, fields and houses, but (gyis) if they give a human loan (myi skyin na), they must each give one that is commensurate.   46 Nor-bu’s work is excerpted in BSOD-NAMS TSHE-RING 2004: 381. 47 For the range of meaning of ’tsho and related words, along with examples from Old Tibetan texts, see STEIN 1973: 422-23. 48 While ‘defilers’ is an unfortunate translation due to the considerable baggage it carries, ‘sexual partners’ ignores the fact that the woman has been kidnapped, and ‘rapists’ would be indicated by another Tibetan term, byi-ba. This may be a case where vulgarity is not a failure to communicate, but an accurate translation of the Tibetan. In point of fact, another Old Tibetan document, a wooden slip from Miran, reveals that there was a law for punishing rape committed by soldiers, and that justice was administrated directly by the general (dmag-pon) and the ‘inspector’ (spyan). The slip reads, ‘rapist dispatched to the general and inspector to try according to the great law’ (byi ba bgyis pa khrims che la thug pa // dmag pon dang/ spyan gis dbyongs dkyigs [la] gsol cig.

Pragmatically, perhaps, the judges do not attempt to forcibly reclaim the woman for her husband, as he has already failed in this. They hold out the possibility of a repayment in kind, a ‘human loan’, as recompense for the husband. Incidentally, this type of practice was also followed in early twentieth century Tibet when a man and a woman belonging to different lords were married. In such a case, if the woman went to live with the man, the man’s lord was expected to give her lord one of his own female bondservants in return as a ‘human trade’ (mi brje) (GOLDSTEIN 1986: 106). I know of no such examples, however, where such a ‘trade’ between lords resulted from a marriage by capture. The second part of the clause is more interesting, as it deals with unmarried women who are captured, and therefore appears to stand witness to the practice of marriage by capture at an early stage in Tibetan history. This type of marriage is known today in many parts of the Himalayas among Tibetan ethnic groups.58 The second part of the clause is not as clear as the first part, and the translation is uncertain. One of its most striking aspects is the apparent concern it   55 Read dbang. 56 Read zhus-lan. 57 Read dbang. 58 See, for example, VINDING 1998: 225-27, and KIND 2002: 285."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 45 shows with chastity, where dice are prescribed to resolve a dispute of this nature. The mention of a woman being forcibly kidnapped and sold is echoed in other Old Tibetan documents concerned with marriage. One famous document, PT 1083, contains a sealed, official reply to a petition by the Chinese residents of Sha-chu requesting that the Tibetan and Sum-pa ministers no longer take Chinese women as brides (mchis-brang du ’tshal-ba), particularly because they take them under false pretexts (snyad-bthags) and make them serve as bondservants (bran). The Chinese express a desire to be like the Mthong-khyab people, and ‘not allow their women to marry others’ (i.e., maintain racial endogamy) (mthong khyab gyi bu sring lta bu / gzhan du gnyen ’tshal du myi gnang ba dang sbyar zhing. PT 1083, ll. 5-6). The Tibetan minister contemptuously rejects the request, and the title on the back of the dispatch reads, perhaps sarcastically, ‘the seal [of the dispatch] granting the Chinese good marriages’.59 Beyond showing how women could be horribly mistreated after marriage, this document paints a fascinating picture of interracial marriage relations in Sha-cu under Tibetan rule. It reveals that the Mthong-khyab, an ethnic group identified perhaps with the Tongjia people (RONG 1990-1991), practiced racial endogamy. It also reveals that there were marriages between Tibetan and Sum-pa men and Chinese women, and that the Chinese were uncomfortable with this arrangement, and particularly with the servitude of their women to their new overlords. The clauses in ‘Replies’ that concern the legal status of women partly confirm the approach to women found in Old Tibetan marriage by sale documents. A man’s wife was viewed, legally at least, as his property, and he was referred to as her owner (bdag-po, dbang-po). It appears from clause III that a woman did not have the right to break off a marriage without her husband’s consent. Further, should she wish to break off the marriage and return to her natal home, it was incumbent upon her family to provide the husband with a suitable replacement (glud). In the case of a married woman being kidnapped, she is literally ‘robbed’ (phrog) or ‘stolen’ (brkus) from her husband. This case is parallel with the last in that the husband is due a replacement, but this time as a ‘human loan’ from his wife’s captors. In addition, the captors face legal punishment, decided by means of dice.

The Legal Status of Religious Estates Clause IX (ll. 303-20) concerns not only the legal status of loans made by a monastic estate, but the legal status of religious estates and their subjects in general. The clause is quite remarkable, as it demonstrates that the Buddhist monastic estates and temples enjoyed little, if any, legal protection over and above that accorded to other Tibetan subjects. As this clause necessitates a rethinking of the Tibetan Empire’s approach to monastic estates, it will be useful to first review the state of our knowledge on the imperial legislation of Buddhist monasteries and temples. Our most reliable knowledge about the legal and tax status of the Buddhist community in imperial Tibet comes from inscriptions. The most important of these is of course the Bsam-yas Pillar inscription and the documents that accompanied it. These were composed by Khri Srong-lde-btsan (742-c. 800) around the year 779, after the foundation of Bsam-yas Monastery. The pillar inscription itself is very brief, and on the topic of government support for the temples of Ra-sa and Brag-mar and so forth it only states: ‘as to the provisions allotted, they will be neither reduced nor diminished.’ (yo byad spyard/ pa’ yang/ de las myi dbrI myi bskyung bar bgyI’o/) (LI AND COBLIN 1987: 188, ll. 7-9). The specific nature of these provisions is explained in the first of the two edicts (bka’-gtsigs) that accompanied the Bsam-yas Pillar. This is essentially a more detailed version of the carved inscription on the pillar, and lists the names of those who swore to uphold the edict. The passage in question states: The estates (rkyend) allotted to provision the three jewels at those temples are of a suitable amount, and having been bestowed by the authority (bla), they will be neither reduced nor diminished. (gtsug lag khang de rnams su dkond mchog gsum gyi yo byad sbyord ba’i rkyend kyang ran pa ’ong par dpags te bla nas phul ba las/ nam zhar kyang mi dbri mi bskyung bar bgyis so/ KhG: 371).60   60 See also the translation in RICHARDSON 1998 [1980]: 92."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 47 As is most often the case with Old Tibetan texts of this nature, there is little detail about how the monasteries were actually supplied and administrated. This, however, is elaborated in post-dynastic sources, in particular the Sba bzhed. The system for supporting the religious estates (lha-ris), according to the Sba bzhed, was set up almost entirely by Ye-shes Dbang-po, the first Tibetan abbot of Bsam-yas Monastery. In fact, the narrative suggests that the abbot went too far in his support of the nascent monastic community, stating that he fled to Lho-brag because of opposition to his plans for reform. Among the reforms we find those listed in the following passage: Thereafter, through Ye-shes Dbang-po’s foresight, and in order to establish the supports of the church (dkon-mchog) in perpetuity, one hundred subject households were allotted to the church, and three subject households to each monk. The subjects of the religious estates (lha-ris) were no longer controlled by the authority (bla), but control over them was entrusted to the sa\u0005gha.

The passage is somewhat clearer in the form in which it is preserved in KhG, however, so I will quote this passage here instead.62 [Ye-shes Dbang-po] requested that two hundred subject households be allotted to the Three Jewels, and three subject households be allotted to each monk, and that authority being entrusted to the sa\u0005gha, the subjects, men and fields of the religious estates should not be controlled by the authority (bla), and that this should be so in perpetuity... Considering from whom the subjects of the religious estate should be taken—the military (rgod), autonomous fiefs (rang-rje),63 those in possession of an internal tax document (khab-so nang-yig can),64 close   61 See transcription in STEIN 1961b: 53-54. See also the translation in HOUSTON 1980: 66. 62 For a rough translation and commentary on this passage in the Dba’ bzhed, see WANGDU AND DIEMBERGER 2000: 75-76. 63 This reading of rang-rje follows Wangdu and Diemberger’s reading of rang-rje’u (WANGDU AND DIEMBERGER 2000: 75, n. 278). 64 The term khab-so appears to refer in general to the tax office/revenue office (khab-so) and its functionaries (khab-so-pa, khab-so dpon-sna) (LI AND COBLIN"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"48 BRANDON DOTSON relatives (thugs-gnyen)65 or the good estates—[they decided] that the lord’s estates (rje’i-zhing) were suitable, and the overseer (gnang-chen),66 ’Bri Khri-’jam Gung-ston, took it in sections and completely divided it. dkon cog gsum la ’bangs khyim nyis brgya gang zag ban dhe re la ’bangs khyim gsum gyi thang du gcad de dbang dge ’dun la bskur nas lha ris kyi ’bangs mi zhing la bla nas dbang mi mdzad par bgyis na nam du yang brtan zhing legs zhes gsol ba dang. . . rkyen ris kyi ’bangs ni rgod dang rang rje dang khab so’i nang yig can dang thugs gnyen dang gzhi bzang po ’tshal las su sa bzung/ rje’i zhing ni gang zag do ’tshal las gnang chen ’bri khri ’jam gung ston gyis bus bzung ba bzhin du bcad/ (KhG: 382, ll. 6-10, 12-15). This passage suggests that the religious estates enjoyed functional legislative autonomy under Khri Srong-lde-btsan, and also states that their land grants issued from the emperor himself. The fact that the monasteries enjoyed legislative autonomy tells us little, however, about the legal and tax status of the monastic estates. The Skar-chung Pillar and accompanying edict, which are essentially Khri Lde-srong-btsan’s ratification of his father’s Bsam-yas edicts, offer further insight. They both appear to date to the latter half of his reign (c. 800-815),67 and RICHARDSON (1998 [1977]: 71)     1987: 123-25). The present clause, therefore, refers to one in possession of an internal document (nang-yig) issued by the revenue office. Such document would presumably exempt its bearer from unwanted ad-hoc taxes and tithes such as those in support of establishing a monastery. 65 Thugs-gnyen, literally ‘heart relative’, perhaps refers to the hereditary aristocracy, or more explicitly to the near relatives of the Tibetan Emperor, but its definition is far from certain. The phrase khab-so’i thug-nyen appears in the entry for 722 in the Old Tibetan Annals (BACOT et al 1940-46: 23, 46). 66 Translating the Prophecy of Sa\u0005ghavardhana, Thomas renders gnang-chen ‘important personages’ (TLTD1: 60, n.6). In this case, however, it clearly refers to a specific position or post. The spelling and abbreviation make it doubtful that this refers to the great minister of the interior (nang-blon chen-po), and the name ’Bri Khri-’jam Gung-ston appears nowhere in the list of ministers of the interior in the Bsam-yas edict preserved in KhG. The Dba’ bzhed, however, clarifies the term considerably. In a passage where Ye-shes Dbang-po dissuades Khri Srong-lde-btsan from allotting seven households to each monk in favour of three, he argues that ‘some gnang-chen would be abandoned by their sne-bran’ (WANGDU AND DIEMBERGER 2000: 75). Reading sne-bran as a type of bondservant, it is clear that the worry is that they would abandon their estates. As seen from the passage above, the estates are managed by the gnang-chen, but owned by the emperor. Therefore ‘overseer’ seems an adequate translation. 67 On the dates of his reign and the chronology of events surrounding his succession, see DOTSON forthcoming c."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 49 proposes c. 812 as a likely date for the inscription. The following passage is from lines 48-51 of the Skar-chung Pillar inscription. According to the custom upheld by my forebears and my descendants of neither debasing nor destroying the estates designated for the Three Jewels, they are administered according to what appears in the earliest (mgo-nan) register of households (// yab mes dbon sras gang gI ring la yang rung ste/ dkon mchog gsum gyI rkyen bcad pa’i rnams kyang ma dma’s ma zhIg pa’i chos su// lha rIs kyi khyIm yIg gI mgo nan las ’byung ba bzhIn du chis mdzad do//)68 This passage suggests that the religious estates were subject to government administration (chis),69 but that they enjoyed a discount in as much as they were administered according to their original allotment of subject households and not the current tally, which would presumably include a greater number of households. In this way they seem to have enjoyed a privileged tax status in that their growth was not factored in to their tax obligation. The passage also reveals that estates kept records of their subject or tenant households, and that these records were called ‘household registers’ (khyim-yig). The Skar-chung Edict, preserved in KhG, goes into considerably more detail regarding the status of the Buddhist clergy and their property. Monks shall not be awarded as the bondservants (bran) of others. They will not be punished with suppression, and [if] they are involved in a household’s legal punishment (khrin), the charge (gyod) shall not include them. We, the father and the son, have indeed so granted to those officiant-donees (mchod-gnas).70 Never will we eschew or renounce the offerings and the established supports of the Three Jewels at the emperor’s court. Never will they not act as officiant-donees. In short, in the emperor’s court and in the realm of Tibet, there will never be any manner of renouncing or going without the Three Jewels, whether in the reigns of my ancestors or my descendants. Never will those estates (rkyen) allotted to the Three Jewels deteriorate, be des-troyed or not practice the Dharma.   68 From transliteration in LI AND COBLIN 1987: 320, ll. 48-51.

Further, it reveals a certain level of legal immunity on the part of monks in that they were exempted from legal punishments (khrin) involving their houses. This passage is also interesting because it suggests that monks did not necessarily live only in monasteries, but could, and indeed did, live as householders. The Lcang-bu Inscription, issued by Khri Lde-srong-btsan’s son, Khri Gtsug-lde-brtsan (reigned 815-841), is essentially a charter for Lcang-bu Temple. On the topics of legislation and tax, the edict states: He arranged for four monks to reside there and fully apportioned servants of the estate, fields and pastures, religious accoutrements, wealth, cattle and so forth. It serves as a perpetual gift of Khri Gtsug-lde-brtsan. Even the name of this temple was given by the Btsan-po’s order. He attached it to the back of his tutelary temple, ’On-cang-do, and ordered that it be administrated by the authority (bla). The wealth and subjects of the religious estate will not be taxed, and they are not subject to fines, punishments and so forth.

It demonstrates that the religious estate was tax-exempt (khral myi dbab), and enjoyed immunity from fines (khwa) and punishment (chad-ka). This may be due to its status as a particular class of religious estate, namely a ‘great religious estate’ (lha-ris chen-po), though this connection is not made explicitly in the edict. The ‘Inventory of Yu-lim Gtsug-lag-khang’, in PT 997, contains a ‘record’ (thang-yig) of the religious estate’s holdings. Records such as these were deposited in an inventory (dkar-chag), which was copied and kept by various authorities (RICHARDSON 1998 [1992]: 280-82). PT 997 also reveals that Yu-lim Gtsug-lag-khang, and presumably other religious estates, fell under the jurisdiction of a number of petty functionaries, and that while the temple received gifts (yon), it also received fines (khwa), punishments (chad-ka) and reprimands (bla-snon) (RICHARDSON 1998 [1992]: 280-82). This obviously contrasts with the ‘great religious estate’ of Lcang-bu, and suggests that there was a hierarchy of privilege concerning religious estates. Having reviewed these sources on the legal and tax status of religious estates in the Tibetan Empire, it is evident that the general picture is that the church was heavily supported by the emperor, and through this support enjoyed a certain degree of administrative autonomy, tax exemption and immunity from fines. The evidence from ‘Replies concerning the dice statutes from the tiger year dice edict’ generally complicates this picture. Clause IX (ll. 303-20), like all of the clauses in the text, reflects a legal decision made by a judge at the Tibetan court (pho-brang). [Question:] In earlier dice edicts, legal punishments determined in judgments pertaining to the wealth of the church (bkon-mchog) were decided by means of dice.

As for accrued interest, decide by means of dice. The articles of a monk and subjects of the religious estate are [liable to be] decided by means of dice just like common subjects. Legal punishments (khrin), from legal cases or otherwise, concerning the church on downwards, are decided by means of dice. Concerning loans (bskyIs-pa) from the wealth of the church (lit. ‘Three Jewels’) and interest on a loan (bun-skyed), the ‘gift’ (btang) itself is not decided by means of dice.

Here it appears that the interest can be decided by means of dice. The statement that according to the texts of the Dharma it is inappropriate to apply the dice edict to the loan itself is particularly interesting. On the face of it, it may seem that the sa\u0002gha is strictly against making a profit from such loans. However, the next sentence states that interest will be decided by means of dice. As mentioned already, the divination manuals used for mo divination in IOL Tib J 740 reflect a bon-po or bon-po-friendly milieu. Is it possible, then, that the sa\u0002gha objects to having their cases decided in such a manner? If so, the authorities have ruled against the sa\u0002gha, since the clause goes on to state that in the event that the church is punished due to a legal case or another matter, the punishment is decided according to dice. These considerations, however, are secondary. The clause also states unequivocally that the property and subjects of a monk are treated in exactly the same way as those of a commoner. This is in full agreement with Uray’s observations, based on separate documents, that not only the subjects of a religious estate, but the monks themselves, were subject to military service (URAY 1961: 229).75 It is difficult to resolve this with the information from the edicts and other sources reviewed above. One possibility is that the edicts record only those most privileged of religious estates—the temples of the nobles and the personal projects of emperors—and that they therefore enjoyed a tax and legal status quite separate from common religious estates. This is hinted at in Khri Gtsug-lde-btsan’s designation of Lcang-bu Temple as having the ‘rank of a great religious estate’ (lha-ris chen-po’i thang). It appears to be the case, therefore, that there was a stratified system whereby monastic estates, like imperial administrators, carried gradated ranks to which certain benefits were attached. In conclusion, we must revise the simplified narrative popularized by later histories such as the Sba bzhed. According to this narrative, Dba’ Ye-shes Dbang-po dissuaded Khri Srong-lde-btsan from allotting seven subject households to the support of each monk by   75 See also BECKWITH 1987: 169-70, n. 174."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"54 BRANDON DOTSON arguing that it would lead to the destruction of Buddhism in Tibet and the degradation of the royal lineage. Within the narrative, this serves to foreshadow the disastrous consequences brought on by Ral-pa-can’s overzealous allotment of seven households to each monk roughly half a century later. As we can see from the above analysis, there was far more nuance to the Tibetan Empire’s approach to monastic estates. There were probably various ‘ranks’ (thang) of monastic estates, with the ‘great monastic estates’ (lha-ris chen-po) enjoying the greatest benefits. These were the personal projects of the Tibetan Emperors or the temples of those with favour at the court. Lower rank temples and monasteries presumably did not enjoy the same type of lavish support, exemption from fines and so on that these great monastic estates did, and so were subject to the types of procedures detailed in clause IX above. The Provisioning and Conscription of the Tibetan Imperial Army Beyond being the period in which Buddhism first took root in Tibet, the Tibetan Empire is perhaps best known as the time of Tibet’s greatest military prowess. During this age, Tibet vied with China for control of the Silk Route, did battle with the Turks, the Türgis, the Arabs, the Nanzhao Kingdom and the Uighurs. To do so, they required a massive army and a system for requisitioning and supplying their soldiers. While numerous articles have been written about the structure of the Tibetan military, and contribute greatly to our understanding of the Tibetan Empire, none to date have shown how the Tibetan army was constituted and supported. Our only knowledge of how troops were levied comes from one terse statement in the Old Tang Annals that states: ‘For collecting warriors they use gold arrows.’ (BUSHELL 1880: 440). The longest and most detailed clause in ‘Replies concerning the dice statutes from the tiger year dice edict’, clause XI (ll. 331-59), concerns precisely the conscription and provisioning of troops, and describes the system in some detail. It reveals how the Tibetan army was levied and supported, and how provisions were effectively distributed to the troops. The clause, which becomes an enlightening discourse on the policies of imperial Tibet’s army, arises out of a dispute concerning provisions, specifically on what is to be done with the surplus bales of provisions sent by an estate-holder for his bondservants who were conscripted as soldiers.

Concerning soldier punishment itself, it also arises from the statutes of the dice edict that no legal punishment is meted out. Concerning provisioning soldiers to war, a separate soldier having received [the provisions] (dmag god thob), when they are gathered afterwards and the provisions are given, are they [still] given, or are they given back [to the estate holder]? [Answer:] According to the red notch [instructions], have the minister of the exterior dispatch [a letter] asking whether gathering them like this is permissible or impermissible. [Answer:] According to the red dot [instructions], if one adheres to the manual/ code (rtsis-mgo) for gathering soldiers (mun-dmag) and the pronouncements of the authority (bla’i bka’-gsung-ba), all other soldiers are gathered. Concerning their provisioning through planting the harvest, and their provisions falling to someone else, they are put in bales (ltang-bu bab), and, under the soldiers of the thousand-district (stong-sde so’i ’og), they become internal affairs (nang-srid). They then go to be sent as provisions by the group of ten (bcu-tshan) and the tally group (khram-tshan). Now, as for pursuing the soldiers’ provisions by deciding the soldier fines by means of dice, generally many are also like this. As for the military fine, though his own punishment itself is decided by means of dice, concerning the provisions sent by the estate holder (gzhi-bu), according to the law, the soldiers own them. From when they were first levied from the estate and given in perpetuity (gtan-du stsal), they were the soldiers’ possessions (nor). Although this was so even before the dice edict was issued, when the military punishment (dmag chad) is death or banishment, the judicial punishment extends to one’s entire family (bu-smad kun), but [if] the estate holder does not evade (bda’) provisioning [his soldiers], and if this accords with what is seen (rmyig), interest does not accrue on the loan either. Since an estate holder who up until now evades [provisioning soldiers] will anger all subjects, it is fitting to proceed by deciding by means of dice the provisions as well. If one proceeds by deciding by means of dice in accordance with the above request, an estate holder’s soldiers’   76 ‘Horse’ (rta) was crossed out and replaced, below the line by sta, presumably for tiger (stag)."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"56 BRANDON DOTSON [provisions] would not be used up elsewhere (god du ma chud-pas), and whatever of the [estate holder’s] servants (bu-bran) who are suitable to be levied will indeed become soldiers. The provisions will also be gradually paid back, and whether they lose or win, concerning the military punishment, which is like the official punishment, banishment and death and serious legal punishment will be resolved by means of the dice edict. The crop fields (rkya) being resolved by means of the dice edict as well, is it permissible or impermissible not to add [soldiers] to the crop fields? [Answer:] According to the red notch [instructions], do not grant the military punishments to separate crop fields, but add the soldiers to the estate. Concerning the provisions, do not decide by means of dice the interest on the loans, but return them to the estate holder.

When the Tibetan army came to levy troops from an estate for official duty (rje-blas) as soldiers, the estate holder (gzhi-bu) was not only forced to allow his bondservants (bran) to be taken as troops, but was also expected to provision them with the crops from his fields. A certain amount was likely required for each bondservant, and it is this that was sent to his thousand-district (stong-sde) in a bale. There, the ‘group of ten’ (bcu-tshan) and the ‘tally group’ (khram-tshan) recorded its receipt and sent it along. Holding the individual estate holders responsible for the provisioning of bondservants conscripted from their estates as soldiers meant that, theoretically, every soldier would be provided for. Further, as the system would not work unless enough bondservants were left to work the fields, it seems, on the surface at least, to be a sustainable model. The clause also reveals that it was not uncommon for estate-holders to evade the conscription tax, and that punishment for doing so was the death or banishment of an estate-holder’s entire family. This implies that the tax was viewed as an onerous one, and that it depleted the estate holder of valuable labour. The system of troop conscription and provisioning described in this document is highly sophisticated and goes some way towards explaining how Tibet managed to levy and support such a large and successful army. Without the requisite bureaucratic infrastructure, and without the threat of official punishment for those evading these taxes, such a system would have been impossible. PT 1089, a Dunhuang document dealing with the order of rank (gral-thabs) in Sha-cu (Shazhou ᥗ☴, i.e., Dunhuang), lists several officials who presumably would have been involved in these and other affairs. These are the great minister in charge of pastoral estates of the upper and lower regions (stod smad gyI phyug-ma’I gzhIs-pon chen-po) (l. 37), the great tax official (khral-po[n] chen-po) (l. 38), the inspector official of estates (gzhIs-pon spyan) (l. 41), the deputy official of estates (gzhIs-pon ’og-pon) (l. 42), and the tally official (khram-pa)"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58 BRANDON DOTSON (l. 43). The document also names the appointment of one man as both district tax official and as official in charge of estates’ provisions (gzhi-rdzongs), a combination of offices that makes per-fect sense given that provisioning, as demonstrated by clause XI of IOL Tib J 740, can be regarded as an onerous tax.80 The document also sheds some light on the nature of the administrative units stong-sde and tshan, which have been discussed by URAY (1961, 1982), UEBACH (1994) and TAKEUCHI (1994). Particularly, the clause above confirms that thousand-districts (stong-sde) were not concerned only with military matters, and cannot be regarded as brigades. They levied provisions, processed them and sent them along. Further, these tasks were assigned to units within the thousand-district, in this case the ‘group of ten’ (bcu-tshan) and the ‘tally group’ (khram-tshan). In his study of tshan as the subordinate units of the thousand-districts, TAKEUCHI (1994: 856) distinguished two types of tshan: the twenty subordinate units of a thousand-district made up of about fifty households each, and the various types of ‘compound tshan’ units. The former unit, Takeuchi argued, was the equivalent of the Chinese unit jiang ㍸. Among the latter, Takeuchi identified dog-tshan, khram-tshan, brgya-tshan and dar-tshan. He was not entirely clear of the relationship of these latter types of tshan to the former subordinate unit tshan, and stated that it ‘may be the case that these units in compound terms were selected and formed from the members of each tshan for particular purposes’ (TAKEUCHI 1994: 855). Among these functions, he noted that the khram-tshan and brgya-tshan seem to own property.81   80 ‘Cang mdo tse was appointed tax official of one district and [official in charge of] estates’ provisions (gzhi-rdzongs).’ (cang mdo tse sde gcIg gi khral pon dang gzhi rdzongsu bskos so. PT 1089, l. 59; LALOU 1955: 177-78, 182-84). 81 Takeuchi arrived at this conclusion based on the appearance in numerous Old Tibetan boundary documents of phrases such as ‘to the west it borders on the juniper field of the khram-tsan of Da myi bong tshe’ (nub da myi bong tshe khram tsan kyi shug zhing la thug. IOL Tib J 1410; TAKEUCHI 1994: 854). If we proceed with the generally safe assumption that the Tibetan ruler enjoyed at least nominal ownership of all the land, then these tshan groups cannot be regarded as landowners, but must be seen as usufructuaries. Alternatively, it is possible that these boundary documents list neighbouring fields not by their usufructuaries, but by those whose authority they fell under in terms of thousand-district accounting. The latter possibility would make sense in the context of an official document dealing with the jurisdiction of the tally."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 59 The explicit mention in IOL Tib J 740 of a ‘group of ten’ (bcu-tshan), along with the ‘tally group’ (khram-tshan), and the dog-tshan, brgya-tshan and dar-tshan mentioned by Takeuchi, suggest how these ‘compound tshan’ units differed from the ‘standard tshan’ units of fifty households. Though also subordinate to the thousand-district, the compound tshan units were made up of various numbers: we have seen already the ‘group of ten’ (bcu-tshan) and the ‘group of one hundred’ (brgya-tshan). This indicates that tshan in these compounds does indeed mean ‘group’, or ‘team’. Whether or not members of these groups came also from the same ‘standard tshan’ or jiang ㍸ is probably secondary, though in the case of a team of one hundred, this is obviously impossible. This partly resolves the relationship between the ‘standard tshan’/jiang ㍸ and the ‘com-pound tshan’ teams or groups.82 CONCLUSIONS The Old Tibetan document IOL Tib J 740, comprising a mo divination text and a legal text entitled ‘Replies concerning the dice statutes from the tiger year dice edict’, is of great importance for a number of reasons. The connection between the divination text and the legal text reveals that local magistrates employed divination dice and divination manuals to decide legal disputes. In doing so, the method by which cases were decided overlapped significantly with ritual technologies employed by ritual specialists for healing and prognostication. Whether such ritual specialists indeed had a role in the administration of legal justice in these and other cases is unclear. The content of the divination text reveals a truly ‘imperial’ pantheon of deities from whose mouths the prognoses come, in that the text names territorial deities of several different regions. This reveals the creation of a pan-Tibetan pantheon of divinities called into existence by the Tibetan Empire’s expansion and its administrative centralization.   82 This essentially confirms one of Takeuchi’s reservations: ‘we still have to hold as a possibility that tshan in these compound terms have no direct connection with the administrative units tshan and was simply a common word meaning ‘group’, because there is a case where tshan was apparently used as a common noun...’ (TAKEUCHI 1994: 860, n. 32)."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"60 BRANDON DOTSON While in modern Tibetan legal practice it appears that dice, ordeal and chance were employed as a last resort when the facts of a case were disputed or unclear, this is not the case in the clauses of ‘Replies concerning the dice statutes from the tiger year dice edict’. It is evident from the repeated references to earlier dice edicts, such as that of the horse year, that the government issued norms for how to employ dice in legal cases. The clauses of IOL Tib J 740 arise from issues that were not covered by these norms and required clarification. They plainly include instances where dice decided not only disputed facts, but the final outcome of the case, and the punishment of a guilty party. The use of dice was therefore not a desperate measure, but a standard practice codified by legal manuals. Whether recourse to dice in such decisions is interpreted as revealing the will of the gods or being simply a matter of chance, in either case the dice act as an accepted authority exterior to the disputants and the court itself. In this, the will of the gods or the luck of the dice stands over and above the legal process itself. This def-lects the burden of agency from the officials of the court and presumably diffuses the conflict between the disputants. The sets of questions and answers found in ‘Replies concerning the dice statutes from the tiger year dice edict’ expand our understanding of several facets of the social history of the Tibetan Empire. In both form and content, ‘Replies’ emphasizes the centralization of the Tibetan Empire. Faced with legal cases that were not covered by the various legal manuals at their disposal, local magistrates brought their problem to the minister of the exterior (phyi-blon), who in turn sent the matter to the judges of the court retinue. The judges then dispatched either a full decision or a set of guidelines for deciding a case, as in the many instances in the text when the judges instruct that a case should be decided by means of dice. The numerous clauses dealing with debt, loans and interest reveal the extent to which the individual was beholden to the legal, fiscal and bureaucratic machinery of imperial Tibet. The clauses dealing with marriage, separation and kidnapping or marriage by capture further reveal important aspects of Tibet’s social history. The long clause on the legal status of religious estates reveals that monastic estates, the clergy and their subjects were legislated in virtually the same manner as other Tibetan subjects and estates. This leads to the conclusion that the status of monastic estates, like the status of individuals in imperial Tibet, was highly stratified, and that only the most important monastic estates enjoyed the special treatment that came with royal patronage. The final clause of the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"DIVINATION AND LAW IN THE TIBETAN EMPIRE 61 document reveals how the Tibetan army was levied and provisioned, thus partially solving one of the great mysteries of Tibet’s success as a major military force. Taken together with other Old Tibetan legal and bureaucratic documents, IOL Tib J 740 contributes to our understanding of the manner in which the Tibetan Empire constituted itself socially and politically. With a greater understanding of Tibet’s social history, we can move beyond simple platitudes about the rapid growth of the empire, and be far more precise in charting the expansion of the empire and its reach into nearly every aspect of Tibetan life. Such inquiries into imperial Tibet’s legal and bureaucratic culture, along with research into its military and religious traditions, move us towards a social history of Tibet. Such a history will add some nuance and detail to our understanding of the dynamic processes by which a small kingdom in Yar-lung grew to become one of the dominant empires in the history of Central Eurasia.

In the case of Central Tibet we mainly rely on very scattered information derived from Tibetan religious sources—in written and pictorial form—which mostly post-date the period with which we are concerned. Chinese sources on Central Tibet from this era apparently do not even exist. However, the prospects for research are slightly better with regard to the Tibetan or Tibetanized areas at the periphery, such as the tribal confederation of Tsong kha to the north-east of Central Tibet. Concerning its history, for example, we possess a fair amount of Chinese documentation pertaining to the eleventh and twelfth centuries, supplemented by later sources. In the case of the general history of eleventh-century Central Asia, there exist, apart from fragmentary Chinese literary sources, a variety of contemporary local materials. These include written and pictorial religious and non-religious documents on paper or silk, as well as coins, steles and stake inscriptions. However, these sources are not abundant and do not pertain evenly to all the different polities in Central Asia. Furthermore, they are difficult to study because of the great diversity of languages and cultures involved. With regard to the Silk Road states, most of the available sources originate from or concern the areas of Turfan/Gaochang ㉹≗, Dunhuang 㤓䐣/Sha-zhou ᥗᚖ and, to a lesser extent, Khotan. These had all been important realms at certain times, and archaeological research in these areas has been more intensive than in other regions. By   \u0002 This chapter is based on a paper presented at the conference ‘Institutions religieuses, civiles et militaires du Tibet: Documents d’Asie Centrale, de Dunhuang et de Mustang’ at the Collège de France in Paris in May 2005.

Rarely, if ever, do Central Asian sources refer to Tsong kha, so far as I know. Thus, even though it may be fragmentary and sometimes even misinformed or misleading, it seems worthwhile to study the Chinese material referring to our topic. The reason why Chinese historiography took an interest in Tsong kha is related to its strategic value for the Song ᢂ dynasty in the latter’s conflict with the Tangut Empire of Xixia ᝱⤅. Thus, with regard to eleventh-century Tsong kha, the neighbours that figure most prominently are, of course, Song China and Xixia. Since these relations have already been studied in other publications,1 this chapter will focus on the little known examples of interactions bet-ween Tsong kha and the former Silk Road states such as Gaochang, Khotan, Kucha, Ganzhou ᖆᚖ and Liangzhou \fᚖ. Suzhou \rᚖ, Guazhou ᖄᚖ and Shazhou ᥗᚖ will also be mentioned. How-ever, I would like to stress that since our knowledge of the history of these ethnically and culturally very diverse oasis states is still very limited, this chapter aspires to provide no more than a general overview. INTRODUCTION TO TSONG KHA Geographically, Tsong kha designates a region in northeast A mdo (in present-day northeast Qinghai ␥ぇ and southwest Gansu ᖆ\u0011) that is traversed by the Tsong (chu) River,2 including its valley and tributaries.3 In the eleventh-century historical context, however, it indicated the area under the control of the Tsong kha confederation that extended east/west roughly from present-day Lan jo (Ch.   1 See, for example, ZHU 1988, DUNNELL 1994, IWASAKI 1974, 1975, 1986 and HORLEMANN 2004. The research is almost entirely based on Chinese sources. It seems, in fact, that very little information has been transmitted in either Tibetan or Tangut sources.

At the end of the tenth and the beginning of the eleventh century C.E. several tribes east of Lake Qinghai (Mtsho sngon po) formed a confederation that, during the eleventh century, was ruled by Jiaosiluo \u0014\u0015and his offspring. Tsong kha’s polit-ical centre was located in Qingtang ␥⡸ near today’s capital of Qinghai Province, Xining. The confederation played a vital econ-omic, political and military role in relation to its neighbours Song China, the Tangut Xixia Empire and the oasis states of the Gansu Corridor. (See figure 2: Tsong kha and its Neighbours.) Tsong kha not only controlled the southern trading routes between Central Asia and the Song Empire, but it was also an important breeding area for horses that were much sought after by the Chinese military. Furthermore, sharing borders with the rival empires of China and Xixia and with the small oasis state of Liangzhou lent Tsong kha special military and strategic significance and made it an attractive potential ally. Even the more distant Liao \u0017 Empire entertained relations with Tsong kha.7 Surprisingly, information on the ties between Central Tibet and Tsong kha, which presumably were quite close, hardly exists.8   4 Ch.

This connection appears, however, rather questionable (HORLEMANN 2005). We also know that Tsong kha played a vital role in the revival of Buddhism in Central Tibet during the tenth century when Dgongs pa rab gsal (c. ninth-tenth centuries) and his disciples were teaching the Dharma in this area. Apart from this, information on the tenth- and eleventh-century Tsong kha region in Tibetan sources is scarce.

Regarding the general nature of contacts between Tsong kha and the Silk Road states, our information is mainly restricted to military affairs, marriage alliances and trade or tribute relations. 1. Liangzhou \fᚖ (Modern Wuwei ⊑┘)9 Liangzhou is situated at the eastern end of the Gansu Corridor and on the spur of the Qilian ⍡\u001b mountains, just north of Tsong kha. It has a long history as a major trading post on the Silk Road and as an important Buddhist centre that dates back to at least the fourth century C.E. Since the mid-tenth century Liangzhou had been ruled by a confederation of different tribes; first under the leadership of the Zhebu ᤩ遑 chieftains and later under the leadership of the Zhelong ⍱\u001f chieftains. These tribes seem to have been ethnically diverse and probably consisted of Uighurs/Huihe ᙧ!/Huigu ᙧ\", Qiang ⍩, Wenmoᕱ/Hunmo %ᕱ10 and Tibetans. Furthermore, Liangzhou also had Chinese inhabitants.11   9 Formerly also called Xiliangfu \t᥉刲. 10 According to the Xin Tangshu the Chinese term Wenmo (also: Wumo, variant: Hunmo) designates groups of people who had been enslaved by the Tibetans in the seventh to ninth centuries and who worked the fields and tended the animals in the newly conquered areas of the Tibetan Empire; Xin Tangshu 216b: 6.108. THOMAS (1946: 516) reconstructed Wenmo as Tibetan *(d)mun (d)mag, a reconstruction that RICHARDSON (1998 [1990]: 173) also adopted, whereas URAY (1988: 517, n. 6) suggested *’od ’bar without further explication; it seems that Uray refers to HAMILTON 1955, but I could not find ’od ’bar in HAMILTON, although he has a rather detailed note on the Wenmo on pp. 30-31 as well as on pp. 129-30. According to Brandon Dotson, whose understanding is based on several different Dunhuang texts, mun dmag simply designates ‘soldiers’, possibly ‘conscripted soldiers’, since estate holders were obliged to provide a certain number of their bondservants as soldiers for the Tibetan army; see DOTSON, in this volume. Thus we might consider ‘Wenmo’ as a collective term for former serfs of estate holders within the Tibetan Empire who were drafted as soldiers and who, after a military campaign was terminated, served again as farm hands on the newly established estates in the conquered areas. Their ethnic background remains unclear, but most likely the Wenmo were ethnically diverse depending on where and how they became serfs in the first place. However, the Chinese character ‘hun 覗’ in Hunmo, which is the same as in ‘Tuyuhun ┲\u000e覗’, one of the Chinese terms for the ’A zha people, might indicate a connection between these two. This supposition is further supported by the fact that after the collapse of the Tibetan Empire the Wenmo are found all"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" THE TSONG KHA CONFEDERATION 85 At the beginning of the eleventh century some tribes that later belonged to the Tsong kha confederation were close allies of Liangzhou in its fight against the Tanguts, which started around 1003. Chinese sources specifically mention tribes from Kangu &’, Lanzhou and Zongge III⢂.12 When Liangzhou, which was further unsuccessfully attacked by the Tanguts in 1008 and 1015, finally fell around 1032, a large part of Liangzhou’s population seems to have fled to the Tsong kha region. The sources speak of about 100,000 people, but this number is most probably inflated.13 2. Ganzhou ᖆᚖ (Modern Zhangye *㑅) Ganzhou had been dominated by the Uighurs at least since the early tenth century.14 In the second half of the tenth century, Ganzhou’s sphere of influence included not only the oasis of Ganzhou itself, but most likely also the areas of Suzhou \rᚖ (near modern Jiuquan ㉘☲), Guazhou ᖄᚖ (near modern Anxi ᚒ᝱) and probably even Shazhou ᥗᚖ.15 The relationship of Ganzhou to the Uighur Empire of Xizhou ᝱ᚖ remains obscure; it seems possible that Ganzhou had been Xizhou’s vassal. Nevertheless, Ganzhou acted fairly     over Gansu in former strongholds of the Tuyuhun, where they appear to have formed new socio-political entities that became quite influential, with Liangzhou being one such example. 11 For a more detailed account on the history of Liangzhou, see, for instance, IWASAKI 1974 and 1986, as well as the early nineteenth century work by Zhang Shu, the Liangzhou fuzhi beikao. 12 Zongge and the other tribes helped to pursue and punish six former Zhelong tribes that had changed sides from Liangzhou to the Tanguts. See Songshi (compiled in the early fourteenth century) 40: 14.157. 13 See the eleventh-century work Longpingji 20: 10r. 14 For a more detailed account of Ganzhou’s history see PINKS 1968 and HAMILTON 1955. 15 Ganzhou and Shazhou had struggled for supremacy over the western Gansu Corridor since the early tenth century. In 977, the Ganzhou ruler styled himself Gan-, Shazhou Huigu Kehan Waisheng \u000f蠓偂㉐\u001218.蝇, the ‘Uighur Khan of Gan- and Shazhou, the nephew/son-in-law (of the Chinese emperor)’, when sending tribute missions to the Chinese.

Furthermore, the Liao Empire also encroached on Gan-zhou’s territory north of Suzhou/modern Jiuquan. At the beginning of the eleventh century, Ganzhou offered a military alliance to Song China against the Tanguts, but the Chinese court was hesitant because of its ongoing conflict with the Khitan Liao Empire. Thus the Ganzhou Uighurs depended on their immediate neighbours, Liangzhou and the newly-established Tsong kha confederation, for help. Tsong kha was not only already an ally of Liangzhou in its fight against the Tanguts, but it also offered alternative trading routes to China bypassing the Tanguts south of the Qilian mountains. Therefore, the Ganzhou qaghan was interested in improving his ties with Tsong kha and so offered a marriage alliance in about 1012/1013. However, the Tsong kha ruler Jiaosiluo refused to pay the bridal price for the Uighur princess and the planned marriage did not take place. Thereafter, Tsong kha also blocked the trading routes for Ganzhou, which caused the qaghan to implore the Song court in 1015 to urge Tsong kha to reopen the routes.17 One Chinese source claims that between 1016 and 1018 the succeeding Ganzhou ruler renewed the offer of a marriage alliance and that thereafter a Uighur princess was married to one of Jiaosiluo’s three sons.18 However, we lack more specific inform-ation about this and the source might have confused this marriage with that of either Jiaosiluo’s son or grandson to a Kuchean princess, which probably occurred around 1060. (See figure 3: Rulers of Tsong kha and Marriage Alliances.) Nonetheless, Ganzhou resumed its tribute missions to the Chinese court around 1018 and continued to do so until circa 1028.19 Starting in 1026/27, the Khitan and the Tanguts staged frequent assaults on the greater Ganzhou region. Liao put pressure on the western area and the Tanguts attacked from the east. In Chinese   16 See Songshi 40: 14.114-14.116.

See Ganzhou fuzhi 1: 180-81."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" THE TSONG KHA CONFEDERATION 87 sources, news of the Ganzhou Uighurs stops around 1028, but it might have been a few more years before the Tanguts successfully conquered Ganzhou, since only in 1035 did a great number of Ganzhou Uighurs (approximately 10,000) flee to the Tsong kha territory. Furthermore, only in 1035 did the Tanguts officially incorporate the Ganzhou area into their realm as ‘Zhenyijun’ /ᙸ1.20 The sources do not mention where in Tsong kha the Ganzhou Uighurs settled, but it seems likely that they took refuge in the area south of the Qilian mountains and north of lake Qinghai. This is the area where we find the so-called ‘Yellow Head Uighurs/Huangtou Huihe 23ᙧ!’ starting from the second half of the eleventh century, as well as the ‘Dada 4偘/Tartars’.21 When the Chinese court considered enlisting the military help of the Dada and the Uighurs against the Tanguts in the 1080s, they probably referred to these Yellow Head Uighurs and the Caotou Dada ㆕34偘.22 An ethnic group called Sarig Yugur, ‘Yellow Uighurs’, still exists to this day.23 According to Chinese sources, Uighur tribute missions also occurred in the years 1068, 1073 and 1074; thereafter, the Uighurs rarely sent tribute.24 However, from these sources it is not clear whether these Uighur tribute missions came from the Yellow Head Uighurs or from the Uighurs of the realm of Xizhou.25   20 See Longpingji 20: 10r, Songshi 40: 14.161 and Ganzhou fuzhi 1: 183. 21 The latter are said to have sent tribute missions to the Chinese court together with the Ganzhou Uighurs as early as 996, and then again with Tsong kha and the Uighurs starting from about the second half of the eleventh century. See YANG 2003: 34 and Xu zizhi tongjian changbian 341: 3.171.

Suzhou \rᚖ (Near Modern Jiuquan ㉘☲) and Guazhou ᖄᚖ (Near Modern Anxi ᚒ᝱) Neither Suzhou nor Guazhou is specifically mentioned in connection with Tsong kha, and this can be interpreted as further evidence that the two were not independent oasis states but probably belonged to the realm of the Ganzhou Uighurs as already mentioned above.26 Suzhou came under attack from the Khitan in about 1008 and later also from the Tanguts.27 We still do not know when and by whom it was finally conquered. According to the Historical Atlas of China, the Suzhou area had become part of the Tangut Empire by 1038.28 Guazhou came under attack by either the Khitan or Tanguts at about the same time as Suzhou and probably also fell in the 1030s.

Shazhou ᥗᚖ/Dunhuang 㤓䐣 According to Chinese sources, the Shazhou rulers had sent ‘tribute’ to the Chinese court and received ‘gifts’ and ‘titles’ in return since the beginning of the Song Dynasty in the mid-tenth century. Tribute missions from Shazhou are mentioned up to the mid-eleventh century.30 Although Shazhou is not specifically mentioned in connection with Tsong kha, this, again, might be an indication that at the beginning of the eleventh century Shazhou was not an independ-ent oasis state, but was part of the realm of the Ganzhou Uighurs, or was at least closely affiliated with them.31 For instance, in 1014 the Shazhou ruler styled himself the Shazhou Huigu Dunhuang junzi ᥗᚖᙧ\"㤓䐣ᠳ፧, or the ‘lord of Dunhuang of the Shazhou Uigh-urs’.32 Another source speaks of the Gan-, Shazhou Huigu kehan waisheng ᖆᥗᚖᙧ\"ᔡᜨᕂ䀧, the ‘Uighur Khan of Gan- and   26 Refer to n. 15 above. 27 See Ganzhou fuzhi 1: 179 and the early twentieth century Gansu xin tongzhi 46: 6. 28 See Tan Qixiang, vol. 6: 36-37. 29 See IWASAKI 1986: 103 and Gansu xin tongzhi 46: 7. 30 According to URAY (1988: 516), the last tribute mission is mentioned in 1052.

It is usually assumed that Shazhou was conquered by the Tanguts in the 1030s.35 Thus the change of title might have occurred in connection with the new Xixia overlordship. b. Shazhou might have become fully independent after the fall of Ganzhou and before it was conquered by the Tanguts. c. It might have fallen under the influence of the encroaching Liao Empire. d. It might have become associated with the Xizhou Uighurs. e. Or Shazhou might have come under the influence of the Yellow Head Uighurs.36 It seems most probable, in fact, that Shazhou was associated with the Xizhou Uighurs after Ganzhou had been seriously threatened by the Tanguts.37 We know, for instance, that Shazhou allied itself with Kucha in 1037 to send tribute to the Song court. Although the Shazhou area (including Guazhou and Suzhou) was repeatedly attacked by the Tanguts starting from 1030, Shazhou still sent seven tribute missions to the Song between 1034 and 1049.38 The final conquest of Dunhuang itself apparently did not occur before 1052/53.39 In fact, only in the 1070s do we find definite evidence of Tangut presence in Shazhou.40 Thus, assuming that Shazhou was never really independent during the eleventh century, having been first dominated by Ganzhou, then by Xizhou and later by the Tanguts, it is not surprising that we find no evidence of any military or marriage alliances between Tsong kha   33 See Songshi 40: 14.114. 34 See URAY 1988: 516. 35 See, for example, HAMILTON 1996: 136 and DUNNELL 1994: 179. 36 For the Yellow Head Uighurs see the Ganzhou chapter above. 37 See KY\u0002ANOV 2004: 155 who, however, refers to Moriyasu in this matter. 38 See Songshi 40: 14.123. 39 See URAY 1988: 516. 40 See DUNNELL 1994: 179 and 1996: 36."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" THE TSONG KHA CONFEDERATION 91 and Shazhou.

Gaochang ㉹≗/Qocho/Jiaohe ᘒ⌂/Xizhou ᝱ᚖ (Near Modern Turfan/Tulufan ᙕB䀰) The area of Gaochang came under Uighur domination in the mid-ninth century and was apparently the centre of Uighur power in the Tianshan ᐴ፴ area during the tenth and eleventh centuries. However, it remains uncertain how far Gaochang’s sphere of influence actually extended at given times.41 Unfortunately, Chinese sources are somewhat confused when they refer to the different Uighur realms. The Songshi, for example, has different sections on Gaochang, the Uighurs in general and on Kucha, with the Gan- and Shazhou Uighurs mentioned in the general Uighur section. Furthermore it often refers to the so-called ‘Xizhou Uighurs’, who are supposed to be equivalent to the Kucha Uighurs,42 although ‘Xizhou’ was one of the old names for Gaochang during the Tang Dynasty and is thus usually associated with this area.43 To make things even more complicated, during the Song Dynasty the name ‘Xizhou’ apparently also referred to the area of Yanqi 㕣ᅫ/Kara-shahr, near today’s Korla/Ku’erle HI㌈, which is roughly midway between Kucha and Gaochang.44 It is usually assumed that the formerly independent realms of Gaochang and Kucha had been united sometime during the tenth century and remained so until the eleventh century.45 However, we might also consider the possibility   41 In 1001 the Uighurs claimed that their realm extended from the snow mountains in the west, i.e., the Tianshan, to the Yellow River in the east; see Songshi 40: 14.115. A similar claim is made in a Uighur stake inscription found in Qocho that obviously also refers to the early eleventh century (HAMILTON 2004: 122). Furthermore, we find also the expression Gaochang zhu guo, ‘all the coun-tries/principalities of Gaochang’ in Songshi 40: 14.161, which seems to imply that the realm of Gaochang consisted of several subordinate principalities. See also TIAN 2003: 13. 42 See Songshi 40: 14.123. 43 However, the Chinese military unit that was also called by the name of ‘Xizhou’ not only moved its seat to Kucha, but also repeatedly changed its name during the seventh and eighth centuries. 44 See Qinding huangyu xiyu tuzhi 3: 16v, 5:7. Thus, the centre of Uighur power might have shifted at different times and it appears possible that at some point Yanqi was in fact the capital of the united Uighur realm and not Kucha or Turfan/Gaochang proper, but this needs to be examined further. 45 Our knowledge of the history of the relations between Gaochang and Kucha from the eighth to the twelfth/thirteenth century is still very limited, as is apparent"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"92 BIANCA HORLEMANN that Gaochang and Kucha remained separate, though closely assoc-iated political units until Kucha became part of the realm of the Muslim Qarakhanids sometime during the latter part of the eleventh century.46 According to the 18th century geographical work Qinding huangyu xiyu tuzhi, general references to ‘Gaochang’ in Song Chinese sources might also refer to the former capital or summer residence of Beiting ᔑᢘ/Beshbaliq, about 150 km north of modern Turfan, and not necessarily to the area of Gaochang proper.47 A unique, but important reference to Tsong kha in this connection concerns its first ruler Jiaosiluo, who, according to some Chinese sources, was supposed to have come from a place named ‘Gaochang Moyuguo’ ㉹㌨嘃䎂=.48 I have not been able to identify Moyuguo 嘃䎂=, but I presume that it does not designate a guo =, namely a ‘Kingdom or Principality of Moyu’, but that Moyuguo was the Chinese rendering of a Uighur place name in the realm of Gaochang.49 Thus, ‘Moyuguo’ might, for example, represent the Turkish ‘Murtuq’, a village not far from where the famous Buddhist grottoes of Bezeklik are situated.50 If we presume that Jiaosiluo’s place of origin was in fact in the Turfan area, this would mean that Jiaosiluo was born in a locality under Uighur rule.51 However, we do not automatically have to consider him a Uighur, since Gaochang, like Tsong kha, had a multi-ethnic population.52 Although it appears     from more recent publications. See, for example, TIAN 2003, PETECH 1992, UMEMURA 1996: 365 and TROMBERT 2000. 46 On Kucha, see paragraph 6 below. 47 See the map and notes in Qinding huangyu xiyu tuzhi 3: 10-11. 48 See, for example, Songshi 40: 14.160 and Longpingji 20: 9v. 49 According to Chinese custom, the name of the bigger territorial unit precedes the smaller unit, e.g. Zhongguo Beijing. Therefore, with regard to Gaochang Moyuguo, Gaochang should refer to the kingdom or principality whereas Moyuguo designates the smaller locality, e.g. a village or oasis. 50 Another location called Moyu 㜈\u001a, albeit with different Chinese characters, is found near Khotan where a great hoard of mainly Song coins, but also including a few Qarakhanid coins, has been unearthed in 1992. See BIRAN 2001: 80. However, this Moyu is most probably not related to Gaochang Moyuguo. 51 The Turkologist MALJAVKIN (1983: 80) explicitly maintains that Jiaosiluo was born in Turfan. 52 The population of Tsong kha probably consisted of remnants of the formerly dominant ’A zha people (Ch. Tuyuhun ┲\u000e覗) and of the Qiang \u001b, Central Tibetans who had remained after the disintegration of the Tibetan Empire in the ninth century, Tanguts (who were actually multi-ethnic as well), Uighurs, other Turkish people like the Shatuo 蠓\u001c, and last but not least, Chinese who stayed in and around former Chinese military garrisons established during the Tang Dynasty."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" THE TSONG KHA CONFEDERATION 93 that the majority of the population was either Uighur or Chinese, there is evidence of friendly Tibetan-Uighur relations in Gaochang during the tenth century when Jiaosiluo was born. Furthermore, Gaochang might still have had a small community of Tibetans remaining from the time of the Tibetan domination during the eighth and ninth centuries, or a community of Tibetan merchants.53 However, since the origin of Jiaosiluo still remains obscure, we also have to consider the possibility that the above-mentioned Chinese sources that refer to Gaochang Moyuguo are misleading or mistaken.54 6. Kucha/Guici PQ (Quci XQ/QiuciᒃQ)/Anxi ᚒ᝱/Modern KucheHT The Uighurs dominated the Kucha area at least since the late ninth century. The area of Kucha proper is called Guici (variants: Qiuzi, Jiuci), or Anxi in Chinese. However, when the Song Chinese referred to the greater realm of Kucha, they also called it ‘Xizhou Huigu ᝱ᚖᙧ\"’, ‘Xizhou Guici ᝱ᚖPQ’, and ‘Guici Huigu PQᙧ\"’.55 Thus, the ruler who was usually designated as the ‘Xizhou Huigu kehan/Khan of the Xizhou Uighurs’ by the Chinese might have been the khan of Gaochang proper (the former Xizhou), Kucha proper, or of a united Uighur realm of Gaochang and Kucha, with the latter alternative being the most likely.56 In 981, for example, the Uighur ruler was styled Xizhou waisheng shizi wang Asilan han ᝱ᚖᕂᖇV፧ᑸ␙\u0014\u0012X.57 The waisheng ᕂᖇ, or ‘foreign born’ in the      Some evidence seems to suggest that the majority of the Tsong kha population led a nomadic or semi-nomadic life and was organized in tribes according to Central Asian patterns. They coexisted with a small settled population of farmers, traders and monks living in and around fortified villages that also served as ‘residences’ for the tribal chieftains. For a more detailed study of Tsong kha’s population see HORLEMANN 2004: 174-88. 53 See VON GABAIN 1973: 27-28. 54 One Chinese source provides ‘Wusanmie 蔆\u001e⚅’ as the place of origin of Jiaosiluo. This, however, could be the Chinese rendering for Dbus Bsam yas, a famous place in Central Tibet. For more information, see HORLEMANN 2005. 55 See Songshi 40: 14.123. 56 See the paragraph on Gaochang above. The history of the relations between Kucha and Gaochang from the eighth to the twelfth or thirteenth century still remains obscure, as may be seen in recent publications; refer, for example, to LIU 2004: 180-82, GENG 2004: 95-96, TIAN 2003, TROMBERT 2000, and PETECH 1992: 10-11. Concerning the title of the ruler, see Songshi 40: 14.123. 57 See Songshi 40: 14.110.

Shizi V፧ is to be considered as a misprint for shizi Y፧, ‘lion’, a duplication of Asilan (han), i.e. Arslan (khan), the ‘lion (khan)’, apparently a frequently recurring name among Gaochang rulers.58 Furthermore, in 1018 we hear of a Guici guo kehan wang Zhihai PQ=ᔡᜨᑸ㤥ぇ, ‘Zhihai, the khan and king of the realm of Kucha’, who seems, however, to be identical with the Gaochang ruler.59 Thus it seems that Kucha and Gaochang—at least at certain times—were governed by one and the same individual, who is sometimes referred to as the ruler of Xizhou and sometimes as the ruler of Kucha. Apparently Kucha sent tribute missions to the Song court on a rather irregular basis starting from 962 onwards. The Songshi mentions missions in 962, 965, between 968 and 976, 98160 and 1013, as well as between 1023 and 1038.61 After a gap of more than three decades, three more tribute missions from the Kucha Uighurs are documented for 1071, 1072 and 1096. Tribute goods in this last mission also included one or more Buddha statues made of jade.62 The absence of missions between 1038 and 1071 might have been due to the unstable situation in East Turkestan caused by the advance of the Tanguts to the east and the Muslim Qarakhanids to the west. It still remains uncertain when exactly the Kucha area was conquered by the Qarakhanids and how tightly it came under Muslim rule. According to Arabic sources, it appears as if Kucha was already under Qarakhanid rule by the mid-eleventh century.63 If this holds true, then the Muslim ruler must have been exceptionally tolerant with regard to symbols of non-Islamic religions such as the jade Buddhas presented to the Chinese in 1096 as mentioned above.   58 For other Uighur rulers called ‘Arslan’ among their multiple names and titles see, for example, SUNDERMANN 1992: 66 and UMEMURA 1996: 365-68. 59 See Songshi 40: 14.117 and TIAN 2003. For possible identifications with Uighur rulers according to Uighur sources see also UMEMURA 1996. 60 In 981 the Chinese sent a mission to the Xizhou Uighurs that probably returned in 984, and which gave a rather detailed report to the Chinese emperor.

Her Chinese name reads Qingyi Jiemou ␥VIe᜹, or Qingying Jiemou ␥␆e᜹, where ‘Jiemou e᜹’ is probably a phonetic rendering of the Tibetan rgyal mo, ‘queen’.65 (See figure 3: Rulers of Tsong kha and Marriage Alliances.) Later on, this Kuchean princess probably became the wife of the new Tsong kha ruler, Aligu ␙⁂㉸, the successor and adoptive son of Dongzhan.66 The Kuchean princess is last mention-ed in 1099/1100, when, together with the Khitan and Tangut princesses, all surrendered to the Chinese army that attacked the Tsong kha residential seat in Qingtang.67 Kuchean tribute or trade missions also seem to have continued until the end of the eleventh century, since the Songshi mentions a mission in 1096 that travelled as far as Taoxi ♒᝱, the area west of the Tao River in Tsong kha, although this territory was by then partly under Chinese rule.68 If Kucha was indeed under Qarakhanid rule by the mid-eleventh century, this would mean that Tsong kha also entertained relations with a newly converted Muslim area. 7. Khotan/Yutian ፔl/Near Modern Hetian TELᖐ The realm of Khotan is generally considered to have been conquered by the Muslim Qarakhanids in about 1006,69 although some scholars assume that the influence of the Qarakhanids did not become apparent before the mid- or even late eleventh century.70 For in-   64 See the eleventh-century work Lequanji 22: 24r. 65 See Lequanji 22: 24r. 66 Aligu apparently exercised the levirate, taking the wife or wives of close deceased male relatives as his own wives. It seems that the former Khitan wife of Dongzhan as well as the former Tangut wife of Dongzhan’s son also became Aligu’s wives.

In 1063, however, a Chinese source explains that the self-designation of the Khotan ruler Hei han 䉅p stands for qara (= hei 䉅, black) and khan, which apparently points to the domination by the Qarakhanids at least by that time.72 Khotan maintained tribute relations with Song China starting from the mid-tenth century and often sent monks on these missions. It seems that Khotan also joined with Kucha from time to time to send tribute missions to China, and that they used to travel along the Gansu Corridor passing Guazhou and Shazhou before this route was blocked by the Tanguts. According to the Songshi, the missions stopped altogether between 1025 and 1063.73 Three missions sent between 1068 and 1081 did not return to Khotan for reasons unknown.74 Perhaps these missions had been intercepted by the Tanguts. Starting from 1081 onwards, Khotan sent its tribute missions to China via Tsong kha, which provided guides to the Khotanese as well as living quarters for the Khotanese merchants in the Tsong kha capital Qingtang.75 However, these activities prob-ably came to a halt in 1099 when the Chinese started to attack Qingtang. In 1093 the Khotanese are supposed to have asked the Song court for assistance against the Tanguts, but in vain. In 1097, Khotan reported to the Chinese that the Khotanese themselves had attacked the Tanguts in Shazhou, Suzhou and Ganzhou.76 If Khotan was in      Muslim religious life apparently pertain to the late twelfth, or early thirteenth cent-ury (private communication). Thus eleventh-century Khotan might have had some kind of vassal status with regard to the Qarakhanids instead of having already been fully incorporated into their realm. However, the conquest and incorporation of Kashgar, approximately 400 km northwest of Khotan, by the Qarakhanids in the second half of the tenth century is undisputed. 71 See DUNNELL 1994: 179. 72 Although the Khotan ruler is already mentioned as heihan in 1009, it seems to me that this title only slipped into the fourteenth century work Songshi in retrospect; see Songshi 40: 14.107. Concerning doubts that the Chinese heihan is a proper rendering of the Turkish qara khan, see JIANG 2001. 73 See Songshi 40: 14.108. 74 See Songshi 40: 14.109. 75 See Songshi 40: 14.109 and the late eleventh/ early twelfth century work Qingtanglu in Shuofu 35: 12r. 76 See Songshi 40: 14.109. Tangut attacks on Khotan, unfortunately without dates, are also confirmed by the Qingtanglu in Shuofu 35: 12r, which even refers to a complete conquest of Khotan by the Tanguts.

This might also shed new light on the question of why and when the so-called Dunhuang documents were hidden in a sealed cave at the Mogao Grottoes near Dunhuang/Shazhou.78 Apparently, the relations between Tsong kha and Khotan intensified after the Tsong kha ruler Dongzhan (1032-1083; reigned 1065-1083) had taken a Khotanese woman named Zhangmou Xiabu 㢑᜹剡遑 either as his servant or his mistress.

FINAL REMARKS The picture that has been drawn here of the relations of Tsong kha to its neighbours on the Silk Road still remains sketchy due to the scarcity of sources. Hence, only a few general observations seem warranted: 1. Tsong kha played a vital strategic role during most of the eleventh century and thus continuously entertained political, military and economic relations with its many neighbours, of which the intensity varied according to the actual geopolitical situation.   77 See nn. 69, 70. 78 It is usually assumed that the cave was closed in or before 1035 in order to protect the documents from the advancing Tangut troops. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the cave served as a deposit for ‘sacred rubbish’. For summaries of the different theories, see HAMILTON 1996: 136 and RONG 1996: 23-24. However, according to Rong, the cave did not serve as a deposit for ‘sacred rubbish’ but was the storage room of the former Sanjie Monastery. Furthermore, he assumes that the cave was closed in the early eleventh century when Khotan was attacked by the Qarakhanids (RONG 1996). In my opinion, advancing Muslim troops seem more likely to have precipitated the concealment of these documents than the advent of the Buddhist Tanguts in the 1030s. However, the question of when the cave was actually sealed, at the beginning or maybe only towards the end of the eleventh century, requires further research. 79 See HORLEMANN 2004: 86."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"98 BIANCA HORLEMANN 2. Hardly any information is available on religious and cultural exchange. However, we can presume that this lack of information is mainly due to the fact that we must rely on official and semi-official Chinese sources. These are known to be preoccupied with political affairs and to neglect religion and culture. 3. At first glance, it seems surprising that our sources do not mention ties between Tsong kha and Shazhou/Dunhuang. However, this might further support the hypothesis that during most of the tenth and eleventh centuries Shazhou was not an independent pol-itical entity but probably part of the Uighur realm of either Ganzhou or Xizhou, and later under Tangut control.

As Tibetan studies advanced, the more complex reality of the religious situation in ancient Tibet began to emerge. The first important step was to note that Bon was only one element of the religious world and that the Bon pos were only one category of priests of ancient Tibet. It was therefore necessary to dissociate the properly indigenous elements from those that were foreign, and group them together under the designation of ‘nameless religion’ (STEIN 1962: ch. IV, ‘Religion et Coutume’). A further step was undertaken in the article of Madame Ariane Macdonald, ‘Une lecture des Pelliot tibétain 1286, 1287, 1038, 1047 et 1290: Essai sur la formation et l’emploi des mythes politiques dans la religion royale de Sro\u0002-bcan sgam-po’, published in 1971. In this article she proposed a different, though still fragmentary, vision   \u0002 Dedicated to Ariane Macdonald, who in 1971 opened a new perspective on the religious history of ancient Tibet. 1 This is a revised English version of my thesis at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, IVème Section, Paris, which was published in 1981 under the title Histoire du cycle de la naissance et de la mort: Étude d’une texte tibétaine de Touen-houang (Genève/Paris: Librairie Droz). I have taken into account several publications that have appeared since then in order to correct and ameliorate several passages in the original and include new materials, in particular the article of J.W. de Jong, ‘Le Ga\u0003\u0004avy\u0002ha et la Loi de la naissance et de la mort’, which improves the interpretation of several passages of the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra. However, my original argument of 1981 remains essentially unchanged. I heartily thank Ms. Susan Taponier of Paris, a long time friend, for kindly checking my English translation of the French original.

(For a critical review, see STEIN 1985.) With the help of the Tibetan manuscripts from Dunhuang—the only documents contemporary with the period under study (seventh to tenth centuries)—she identified the fundamental features of the ancient pre-Buddhist religion, which she believed was designated by the term gtsug, or gtsug lag. She further proposed that it was on the basis of gtsug/gtsug lag that the theory of the sovereignty of the ancient kings was founded. Although this is not the place to summarize her arguments, which has been done with clarity and concision by Mme A.M. Blondeau (1976), it is helpful to recall the theory of life and death of this pre-Buddhist religion and the rites that are tied to it, because they directly relate to our study, which also concerns a Tibetan text from Dunhuang. Let us first examine the notion of time, of which the pre-Buddhist theory of death and survival is a part. Time is conceived in the form of great chronological cycles. The first, happy period, which starts with the creation of the world, is called ‘the good period when the gods and the human beings are not separated’. This ‘golden age’ is said to have lasted ten thousand years, and to have ended the day when a demon, imprisoned in the underworld, appeared on the earth. The second, ‘bad period’, is divided into three sub-periods, each one worse than the previous one. It is the period of the gradual degeneration of the tenets of the gtsug, the loss of human attachment to proper religion and the abandonment of its practices. The third and last period is ‘the age of calamities’. This is the worst one of all. It will be followed by ‘the good period of the gods’, which is the beginning of a new cycle marked by the reanimation of those who practised gtsug. On the other hand, according to the conception of survival in this religion, there were two countries for the deceased: one to be avoided and one to be attained. These are ‘the country of miseries and suffering’ (nyon mongs sdug pa’i yul) and ‘the country of joy and happiness’ (dga’ dang skyid pa’i yul), respectively. The latter is the celestial country of the dead (gshin yul) where the deceased await resurrection at the beginning of a new cycle. This explains the fact that the funeral rituals are aimed essentially at sending the deceased persons, guided by psychopomp animals on a perilous journey, to the country of the Dead (gshin yul), where they live happily until their resurrection.2   2 As Mme A. Macdonald has noticed regarding the theory of Time (MACDONALD 1971: 357) and the conception of gtsug lag (376-86), it is probable"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" THE CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH 107 Buddhism, which made its way towards Tibet from India and China as well as from Central Asia, found itself confronted with the ancient indigenous religion. This religion was the foundation of the sovereignty of the ancient kings and the vehicle for concepts and practices that were fundamentally different from and incompatible with those of Buddhism. During the several centuries that followed the introduction of Buddhism, Buddhist disseminators struggled against indigenous religious representations and the followers of the ancient religion who resisted the Buddhists with a philosophy and literature of their own. At the end of this conflict, about which we have no exact knowledge for lack of authentic documents, the elements of the pre-Buddhist religion were absorbed into Buddhism as well as into Bon, which was established as an organised religion from the eleventh century. This process of assimilation was so successful that even the name (if it ever existed) of the ancient religion disappeared from later Tibetan literature. The Dunhuang text that is the subject of this study allows us to witness the first efforts of the disseminators of Buddhism in Tibet. INTRODUCTION 1. The manuscripts Among the Dunhuang manuscripts kept at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris3 and the British Library in London,4     that there are foreign influences (Indian as well as Chinese) in the formation of this ancient religion of Tibet. It is, however, beyond the scope of the present study to look for them, because we are concerned only with the comparison of this pre-Buddhist Tibetan religion as it existed at the end of the eighth century with Buddhism, the newcomer to Tibet. 3 This collection has been catalogued in M. LALOU 1939-61. 4 We think it is useful here to make a brief survey of the manuscripts, in particular the Tibetan manuscripts that concern us directly, which were brought back by Aurel Stein from his second (1906-08) and third (1913-16) expeditions to Central Asia. The total collection was divided in an artificial way into two parts: the mainly “Chinese” collection in the British Museum and the “Tibetan” collection in the India Office Library. Both collections are now preserved in the British Library. We owe to TAKEUCHI Tsuguhito (1998: xv-xxviii) a fairly comprehensive survey of the Tibetan collection in the British Library. There are also Tibetan texts written on the verso of Chinese texts preserved at the British Museum. They have been listed with a short notice of two or three words for each by GRINSTEAD (1963: 36-37). The famous manuscript of the Tibetan Annals"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"108 YOSHIRO IMAEDA there is a story written entirely in verses of seven syllables, which we have designated in this study by the title History of the cycle of birth and death. We have decided on this title after taking into account, on the one hand, the term skye shi’i lo rgyus ‘history of birth and death’, a term employed here and there in the manuscripts to designate the principal subject of the text, and on the other hand, the title which is found at the beginning of two manuscripts: Skye shi ’khor lo’i chos kyi yi ge le’u ‘Chapter of the treatise of the law of the wheel (=cycle) of birth and death’ (PT 220), and Skye shi ’khor lo’i le’u bstan pa’// lha bu rin chen lag (= lags) cis (= gis) dris pa, ‘Chapter of the cycle of birth and death exposed at the request of the son of the gods named Rin chen, “Jewel”’5 (IOL Tib J 345). To date, we have discovered nine copies of this text, all of them incomplete. Although none of the copies contains the complete text, we have been able to establish an almost integral text of the History by collating them. First, here is a brief description of each of the copies.     under the number Or. 8212 (187), which was edited and translated by F.W. Thomas in DTH: 53-75, is among them. As for the Tibetan collection of the India Office Library, its inventory does not seem to have been done in a systematic way. First, a certain number of manuscripts have been published with a description, a transcription of the text, and an annotated translation by THOMAS (1935-55 and 1957). Then, LA VALLÉE POUSSIN (1962) treated almost the entire collection in his Catalogue, giving each manuscript a serial number. More recently, the research team of the Toyo Bunko (Oriental Library), Tokyo, has published a more exhaustive list in Toyo Bunko. In this study, we use the abbreviation IOL Tib J followed by the number of the Catologue to designate the manuscripts in this collection. As for the manuscripts that were not inventoried by La Vallée Poussin, we have systematically designated them by the abbreviation I. O., followed by the number of the volume and the number of the folio in which they are currently preserved. 5 The name of this principal person of the History appears as Rin chen (or cen) in two syllables, or as Rin chen (or cen) lags (or lag) in three syllables. The third syllable is used when it is necessary to add a syllable to achieve the verse in seven syllables of our History. STEIN (1983: 179) suggests that the name is Rin chen lags and that it is a translation of Shancai, the Chinese name of Sudhana, the main character in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, which inspired Chapter II of our History. However, we think that the name of our character is Rin chen and that lags is an emphatic syllable. Furthermore, even if one accepts that the name Rin chen lags is inspired by, even if not translated from, Sudhana of the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, there is no particular reason to assume that it is a translation from the Chinese name Shancai, because Rin chen lags may as well be an older rendering of the Indian name Sudhana, as Nor bzangs is the later canonical rendering: Rin chen = nor = dhana; lags = bzangs = su."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" THE CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH 109 PT 218 The manuscript has thirty-five folios. The sheets used for the present manuscript measure approximately 10 cm by 33 cm and have one or sometimes two holes in the middle. They are pieces (probably halves) of larger sheets measuring approximately 20 cm by 33 cm, of which we see half of the encircled hole. Illustration (1) As for the number of holes perforated in the folios for the string used to keep them together (except the half-hole originating from the original large folio), it seems that at the beginning there was only one hole, made before writing. Then, so that the hole enlarged by use would not interfere with the writing, another one was sometimes added nearby. One notices this on the following sixteen folios: kha to da (10), ba to ja (5) and ya. The folios have six or seven lines on each side (recto and verso), and eight lines exceptionally on the recto of folios pha and tsa and the verso of folio zha. The text of our History seems to end on the verso of the last folio khma, at the second, rather abraded line, which reads as follows, after the actual end of the text of the History: // lha rin cen (one illegible syllable) rdzogs (two or three illegible syllables) chos dbyangs gyis bris te zhus bs..on (two illegible syllables) ..s // This is the colophon of the manuscript, which may be translated as follows: ‘End [of the treatise exposed at the request of] Rin chen, [son of the] gods. [The manuscript has been] copied and revised by Chos dbyangs...’ The name of this copyist does not appear in other Tibetan manuscripts from Dunhuang and therefore we cannot know his identity. There are two syllables at the beginning of the third line: bsngo’ ba’ //. The remaining part of the verso is devoid of text. Did the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"110 YOSHIRO IMAEDA copyist start a new text? The presence of these two syllables poses a crucial problem for the interpretation of the History. We will come back to this question later. Instead of the usual pagination which consists of putting the serial number of folios in the left margin of the recto using Tibetan numbers either in figures or written in letters, this manuscript is paginated by the letters of the Tibetan alphabet. In later Tibetan texts, the letters of the alphabet are normally used only to designate one volume of a collection, or to distinguish different texts within a single volume. It is most probably this unusual pagination that prompted Marcelle Lalou to ask if the manuscript was ‘coherent’ at the end of her description (Inventaire, I: 62). In fact, the analysis of the text allows us to establish the order according to the Tibetan alphabet: kha, ga, nga ... ha, a, kna, khna, gna, ngna, kma, khma. The pagination of the last six folios, which consists in writing another letter under each letter of the Tibetan alphabet (in this case na and ma), is also employed in other Tibetan manuscripts from Dunhuang, such as PT 291, 1336, 1337, 1349, 1343, 1480, IOL Tib J 67 and 382. Among them, PT 291, in particular, consists of seven folios that do not follow one another. However, the four folios marked respectively kna, khna, gna, and ngna can be read as a whole. This is the same system of pagination used in our manuscript.6 Our manuscript is missing only the first folio, the marginal pagination of which should be ka. Marcelle Lalou took folio kna to be the first one of the manuscript and labelled it ‘Pelliot tibétain 218’, which, as a rule, should appear only on the first folio. This error is understandable given that the first folio was, and still is, missing. Three irregularities can be observed in the make-up of the folios: 1. In its original state, the manuscript included two folios cha and da, each with a text on recto and verso. But, unlike the others, each of these folios was composed of two folios pasted together, one with the text of the recto and the other with that of the verso. The restoration department of the Bibliothèque Nationale separated the two folios and found that the folio that contains the text of the recto also has a text on the verso, but written in the direction opposite to normal reading. Therefore, in the cases of folios cha and da, we find a folio (a) with a text of the recto and the verso, and a folio (b) with   6 For other pagination systems found among the Tibetan manuscripts from Dunhuang, see Catalogue, Pagination: xv-xvi."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" THE CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH 111 only a text on the verso and its empty side pasted to the verso of folio (a) in normal reading order. The text on the verso of folio (b) is identical, except for a few variants, to that on the verso of folio (a). We think that the copyist of folios cha and da was mistaken twice in the writing direction of the text of the verso and judged it preferable to write the text of the verso on a new folio—leaving the recto of this folio devoid of text—which he later pasted in the correct direction on top of the verso of folio (a), deleting in this way the verso of folio (a) to obtain a normal layout for the reading of the text. In the photographic reproduction of the manuscript given in IMAEDA 1981, we have placed the verso of folio (a) of folios cha and da in the normal direction to facilitate reading. However, this is how folios cha and da actually look: Illustration (2) 2. On the recto of folio nya, there are five lines of text in the normal direction and two lines and a syllable written in the reverse direction (that is, upside down) and crossed out by a line. The part of the text written in this way (the lower part of the folio is mutilated, as we shall see later) corresponds, except for a few spelling variations, to that written in the normal direction. In the present state of the folio, we cannot understand the reason for this anomaly. There may have been an important error in the lost part of the text written upside down, which the copyist noticed after starting the third line, forcing him to delete what he had already written and to start writing the same text again on the other side of the folio without throwing away the folio already begun."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"112 YOSHIRO IMAEDA 3. The passage which extends from folio a, recto, l. 6, to folio kna, verso, l. 1, is only a repetition of the preceding passage which goes from folio ha, recto, l. 3 to folio a, recto, l. 6. The explanation for this anomaly seems to be the unusual system of pagination of the manuscript: the copyist went in the ordinary manner to the beginning of line 6 of folio a, recto—the last letter of the Tibetan alphabet—where the discourse by the teacher Rgya mtsho’i rgyal mtshan ends and that of the Buddha \u0003\u0004kyamuni is announced. At this point, the copyist copied a passage from line 3, folio ha, recto to line 6 of the verso that precedes folio a in order to fill the remaining part of folio a, recto and its entire verso. There is no logical reason for this repetition. Then, just at the beginning of folio kna—the first folio with a pagination composed of two letters of the Tibetan alphabet—from the recto to the verso, l. 1, one again reads the announcement of the account of the Buddha \u0003\u0004kyamuni by Rgya mtsho’i rgyal mtshan, just as it was written between folio ha, verso, l. 6 and folio a, recto, l. 6. The copyist may have thought that readers might make a mistake by misunderstanding his pagination system and so start reading the manuscript from folio kna. In this case, readers would start by reading the announcement of the story of the Buddha \u0003\u0004kyamuni and then go on to the story itself, which ultimately can be considered as a unified entity. Besides this, the lower parts of nine consecutive folios from cha to pha have been mutilated by a tear. This makes it impossible to read the text of the torn part. Except for this, and the fact that the margins of certain folios and the verso of the last folio khma are rather worn, the manuscript is quite legible on the whole and more complete than the others. We have therefore taken this manuscript as the basis for our study. PT 219 Concertina of six folios. One finds in this manuscript two passages of the History.

Merely reading this analysis raises a number of fundamental questions concerning the composition of this History, its titles, its sources, the identity of its author, the date of its composition and the religious context to which it belongs. Let us first examine the problem of titles. Our History has two, one in (Tibetan-transliterated) Sanskrit, and the other in Tibetan. Sanskrit title Only IOL Tib J 345 (l. 5) gives the Sanskrit title: rgya gar gyi skad du sang gra dar ma de, ‘In the language of India, Sangradarmade’.8 The unusual presence of the particle gyi between rgya gar and skad, the strangeness of the compound ending in de, which does not make much sense in Sanskrit, and above all, the literary form of the History that we are going to examine, suggest that the Sanskrit title is a fictional one invented to give our History the appearance of being the translation of a Sanskrit text to give it greater authenticity. Tibetan title PT 220 (l. 1): skye shi ’khor ba’i chos kyi yi ge le’u, ‘the chapter of the treatise on the law of the cycle of birth and death’. The compound skye shi, ‘birth and death’, is attested in another Dunhuang manuscript, IOL Tib J 710 (see DEMIÉVILLE 1970: 46), where it renders the Sanskrit sa\u0005s\u0004ra, which, according to the Buddhist terminology fixed in 814, is normally rendered ’khor ba (Mvp, nos. 797, 2165).9 The successive enumeration of the two compounds skye shi and ’khor ba in our title therefore seems in a   8 For EIMER (1981: 561), this is sa\u0006kramadharmade\u0007an\u0004, and for DE JONG (1985: 8) it is sa\u0006s\u0004radharma. 9 TUCCI 1958: 48 and YAMAGUCHI 1979: 12."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" THE CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH 117 sense redundant. The author no doubt wanted to express in a concrete manner the Buddhist notion of sa\u0005s\u0004ra ‘transmigration’, which was not yet familiar to his Tibetan readers. Further, the terminology was probably not yet fixed. The term chos kyi yi ge is also attested in another Tibetan manuscript, PT 92 (Inventaire I: 30): thard pa chen po phyogsu rgyas pa’i chos kyi yi ge, which is the abbreviated Tibetan title of a Buddhist text translated from Chinese. This Tibetan translation is incorporated into the current Kanjur (P no. 930): ’Phags pa thar pa chen po phyogs su rgyas pa ’gyod tshang kyis sdig sbyangs te sangs rgyas su grub par rnam par bkod pa shes bya ba theg pa chen po’i mdo. We can see that the term chos kyi yi ge ‘religious writing’ corresponds to mdo, a Tibetan term usually used to translate the Sanskrit word s\u0002tra. It seems, then, that before the term mdo was adopted to translate the term s\u0002tra, compounds like chos kyi yi ge, or dar ma (the phonetic rendering of the Sanskrit dharma ‘law’, see PT 33, 735, 1003, 1005 etc.) were often used to designate this same word.10 As for the word le’u, it generally designates a ‘chapter’, or ‘part’ of a work. Is our History itself a part of a larger work? We will come back to this question later. IOL Tib J 345 (l. 5 to 6): skye shi ’khor lo’i le’u bstan pa’ // Lha bu rin chen lag (=lags ) cis (= gis ) dris pa’ // ‘Chapter of the cycle of birth and death, presented at the request of the son of the gods named Rin chen’. It is evident that the term ’khor lo ‘wheel’ (Skt. cakra) is used here in the same sense as ’khor ba in the preceding title. I. O. vol. 69, fol. 17. The only remaining part of the first line of the fragment 1 reads as follows: ... dun te // lha bu rin ... The second line, again very fragmentary, contains a passage corresponding to the text of the last two syllables of line 7 and the first three of line 8 of IOL Tib J 345. A comparison of this fragment with the other two contained in PT 220 and IOL Tib J 345 leads us to believe that the first line must have been part of the title of our History. It must have been different from that of IOL Tib J 345, at least the part that precedes lha bu rin (chen), but the manuscript is too fragmentary to allow us to reconstruct the whole title.11   10 Cf. RICHARDSON 1977 and STEIN 1983: 175. 11 Refer to the collated transcription of Chapter I given below."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"118 YOSHIRO IMAEDA Now let us tackle the problem of sources by quickly reviewing the plot of the History. All of Chapter I seems to be the original composition of the author, inspired by canonical sources. It relates the sudden death of the king of the gods, King of Blazing Light, the confusion of his son Rin chen, and finally, the departure of Rin chen in search of the remedy against death following the advice of ’Phrul chen Dutara. This introduction is of paramount importance for understanding the entire History. It should be noted, first of all, that Dutara’s epithet, ’phrul chen, ‘great ’phrul’,12 had a well defined and important meaning in pre-Buddhist Tibetan religion. In fact, ’phrul was one of the two supernatural faculties, with byin, characteristic of the divine nature of Tibetan kings. The term ’phrul designated first a set of magical powers, and in particular, the ability to move between the sky and the earth. It also designated a mental and intellectual capacity superior to that of ordinary human beings. Rin chen, upset by the unexpected death of his father, and hoping that his father will return to life and become as before (slar ’ong sngon bzhin yod du re), asks Dutara what he must do in order for his father to live again, so that it will be possible to encounter him (ji bgyis slar mchi ’phrad par rung), and further, what he must do to ensure his father’s peace and happiness (ji bgyis bde bzhin skyid par ’gyur). Dutara replies, ‘Although I know that birth and death exist, I do not know what to do to remedy it (skye shi yod par ’tshal du bas // de la ci phan bdag ma ’tshal).’ As he himself is unable to give a satisfactory reply, Dutara advises Rin chen to go in search of other teachers who might know the answer. So, fearing that his deceased father might not reach the place of peace and happiness (bde skyid gnas), Rin chen departs on a pilgrimage in search of the law of birth and death, a pilgrimage which occupies all of Chapter II of the History. Expressions such as ‘to be at peace and happy’ (bde zhing skyid pa), and especially ‘the place of peace and happiness’ (bde skyid gnas) immediately recall dga’ skyid yul ‘the country of joy and happiness’, which characterises the country of the Dead to which the funeral ritual of the pre-Buddhist religion was intended to send the   12 Although this name seems to be a Tibetan transcription of a Sanskrit name, it is difficult to reconstruct the original name. Is there any link between Dutara and Dh\u0002tar\u0004ja, the name of a bodhisattva attested in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra? (EDGERTON 1970: 286). We owe this reference to Mme A.M. Blondeau."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" THE CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH 119 deceased person.13 The author of our History does not use the literal expression employed in the indigenous pre-Buddhist religion, but changes dga’ ‘joy’ to bde ‘peace, comfort’. However, it is obvious that they are one and the same country, not only in the intention of the author but also in the eyes of the readers—followers of the ancient religion to whom our History is addressed. On the other hand, the word phan (pa), which appears in Dutara’s reply, and which we have translated ‘to remedy’, is used in Tibetan Buddhist terminology to translate the Sanskrit term hita ‘benefit, beneficial’ (Mvp, no. 2871, etc.). It is also employed the compound phan yon, which translates the Sanskrit anu\u0007a\u0006s\u0004 ‘merit’ (Mvp, no. 2626). However, we should recall that the same word, phan (pa), was used in the pre-Buddhist religion as a technical term to desig-nate, in the context of funeral ritual, the success (phan) or the failure (ma /mi phan) to ‘cure’ or revive the deceased.14 In this context the response of Dutara can be better translated, ‘I don’t know what to do to bring the deceased back to life.’ It is therefore clear, except for some minor terminological variations, that the attitude of Rin chen in this situation represents exactly the approach to death that one would assume held sway based on a reading of pre-Buddhist funeral rituals. However, the organisation of this beginning can be compared with that of the Purification of All Evil Destinies (Sarvadurgati-pari\u0005odhanatantra), which is discussed at the end of our History.15 In this Buddhist text, the god named Vimalama\u0003iprabha (Nor bu dri ma med pa’i ’od) ‘Pure Jewel Light’ suddenly passes away and falls from the assembly of Thirty-three Gods into the great hell of Av\u0005ci. In this unexpected situation, the gods, starting with Indra, ask the Buddha, ‘O Lord, where is he reborn? Is he experiencing happiness or sorrow? ... O Blessed One, how can he be saved from such a succession of suffering? How can he be freed from accumulation of suffering? Save O Lord, save O Blessed One.’16 The similarity of the situation, the presence of the element ’od ‘light’ in the names of both personalities, and the confusion raised by their deaths among their retinues suggest that the framework of our History may have been modelled on that of the Sarvadurgatipari\u0005odhanatantra, which,   13 STEIN 1971: 497, n. 52. 14 STEIN 1971: 501, 512, 522, 524, 526 etc. 15 This has been suggested by KAPSTEIN (2000: 206, n. 20). 16 SKORUPSKI 1983: 5."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"120 YOSHIRO IMAEDA judging from the number of Dunhuang manuscripts related to it,17 had become well-known in Tibet by this time. We will return to this question later. Turning now to Chapter II, we can state from the outset that it is a much abbreviated adaptation of the famous pilgrimage of Sudhana (Nor bzangs) in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra (Sdong po bkod pa).18 This s\u0002tra, which was widely disseminated, occupies a substantial part of the work entitled Buddh\u0004vata\u0006saka (Sangs rgyas phal po che). Its Sanskrit text has been edited twice, by SUZUKI AND IZUMI (1934-46, 1949), and by VAIDYA (1960), and has been translated into English from the Chinese (CLEARY 1984-87) We will base our study on the Tibetan version (P no. 761, chapter 45; vol. 26, pp. 117-315), consulting the Sanskrit original (in Vaidya’s edition) as necessary. It goes without saying that the best way to demonstrate that our History depends on the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra would be to detail the cor-responding passages in both of them. However, because the Ga\u0002\u0003a-vy\u0002has\u0002tra is very voluminous and, as we shall see later, of limited interest for our study, we are not going to undertake such a   17 We have a large number of manuscripts from Dunhuang in various forms concerning this canonical text. First, we have a folio that has the abbreviated fundamental formula (rtsa ba’i rig pa) used in this tantra, PT 419. This formula is found in a text entitled Dug gsum ’dul ba ‘Taming of the three poisons’: IOL Tib J 420, 421 (complete), 720 (fragment) and PT 37 (incomplete at the beginning). This text recommends as a remedy against the three poisons (see n. 65) the following three formulae: 1) that of Sarvadurgatipari\u0005odhana, 2) that of a deity who we cannot identify for the time being, and 3) that of Avalokite\u0006vara. The last one is the famous formula in six syllables Om ma\u0003i padme h\u0002\u0005, which is usually absent from the Dunhuang manuscripts. Cf. IMAEDA 1979. We find also in PT 389 one of the ma\u0003\u0004alas presented in this tantra, which has the Buddha \u0003\u0004kyamuni in the centre. LALOU (1936), in publishing this manuscript, did not identify this ma\u0003\u0004ala. For the iconographic detail, see P no. 116, vol. 5, pp. 88-4-8 to 88-5-4, and no. 3451 (commentary by Buddhaguhya), vol. 76, pp. 34-3-5 to 35-3-5. See also SAKAI 1969 and UJIKE 1975. Finally, we have two rituals concerning this ma\u0003\u0004ala: 1) IOL Tib J 439-712 (these two are in fact a single manuscript) which seem rather detailed and 2) PT 37, 67, 298 and IOL Tib J 440, a ritual to perform at the four gates of the ma\u0003\u0004ala. 18 Refer to RENOU AND FILLIOZAT 1953: no. 2012 (Sanskrit text), no. 2037 (Tibetan text) and no. 2112 (Chinese version). On the other hand, the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra is one of the nine most popular texts among the Buddhists of Nepal; see Hodgeson 1874: 13. The pilgrimage of Sudhana, which is the main theme of the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, gave birth to various artistic works (FONTEIN 1967). According to the Sba bzhed, the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra was also adapted to illustrate the wall of Bsam yas, the first monastic complex of Tibet (STEIN 1961: 37). The story of Nor bzangs (Sudhana) also illustrates the eleventh-century monastery of Tabo in Western Tibet (STEINKELLNER 1995)."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" THE CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH 121 demonstration here. We will simply point out certain significant differences between the two versions, which we think are sufficient to illustrate the peculiar features of our History in comparison with the available Sanskrit version. First of all, from a stylistic point of view, the prose text of the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra is rendered in verses of seven syllables in our History (a feature that we have of course not been able to retain in our translation). Furthermore, at the end of each visit of Rin chen to the teachers he encounters, three onomatopoeias—pu ru ru, si li li and ti ri ri19—are added, which are absent from the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002ha-s\u0002tra. The presence of these onomatopoeias, which are usually found in songs, and the style of our History written entirely in verses of seven syllables to facilitate memorisation, suggest that our History was at least partially sung. Secondly, while in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra Sudhana visits a total of fifty-five teachers, from Mañju\u0006r\u0005 at the outset to Samantabhadra at the end, with Avalokite\u0006vara in the middle (twenty-eighth), Rin chen in our History visits only twenty-seven teachers, counting Dutara as the first and \u0003\u0004kyamuni as the last. Apart from these and other mod-ifications, moreover, we should point out that the author of the History used only the first half of the itinerary of Sudhana’s pilgrimage. As for the volume of the text, which comprises 195 folios of large format in the s\u0002tra, it is considerably reduced to 30 folios of small format in our History. To show the manner and the extent to which the author of the History abridged the text of the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, here is the passage recounting Sudhana’s visit to the wandering ascetic Sarvag\u0004min (Thams cad du ’gro ba) ‘One who goes every-where’20 (no. 21 of list B of the teachers given below), corres-ponding to the visit of Rin chen to Kun tu ’gro ba, ‘One who goes everywhere’, here qualified as tshangs pa21 (no. 20 on list A of the teachers). First, the passage from our History:   19 Two of them are attested in another manuscript from Dunhuang, DTH: 116: si li li and pu ru ru. See, too, STEIN 1956: 397, and HELLFER 1977: 386-87. 20 P vol. 26, pp. 187-2-4 to 188-4-4; VAIDYA 1960: 137-39. 21 In the Tibetan translation of the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, this teacher is described as an kun tu rgyu (parivr\u0004jaka) ‘wandering ascetic’ and named Thams cad du ’gro ba (Sarvag\u0004min) ‘One who goes everywhere’. However in our Dunhunag text, he is described as a tshangs pa named Kun tu ’gro ba ‘One who goes everywhere’. It may be that, at the time of the writing of our History, before being used in classical Buddhist terminology to translate the Indian deity Brahm\u0004 (Mvp, 3088 etc.), the term tshangs pa designated in the pre-Buddhist terminology a category of religious"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"122 YOSHIRO IMAEDA (folio za, verso) Then, after having crossed many countries, Rin chen, son of the gods, climbed the mountain Shin tu rnyed pa ‘Well found’.

His splendour and his virtues were blazing and he was encircled by a retinue of ten thousand tshangs pa. Rin chen, son of the gods, prostrated himself at the feet of Kun tu ’gro ba and joined his hands to say, ‘O tshangs pa, deign to look upon me with compassion. I came here to ask you what I do not understand. I am plunged in an ocean of indescribable suffering. I pray you, tshangs pa, instruct me.’ He beseeched him in this way with numerous pleasant words. Kun tu ’gro ba replied, ‘What do you want to ask me, good man? I, Kun tu ’gro ba, have found the door of luminous knowledge (ye shes snang ba’i sgo). I instruct all creatures using various means suitable to their respective vocations. These are my personal virtues. What do you want to ask me, good man?’ (folio ’a, recto) Rin chen responded, ‘My father is named ’Od ’bar rgyal. As his life has been transferred (tshe ’phos), and he has changed bodies (lus rjes),22 what must I do so that he will return [to life] (slar mchis), and so that it will be possible to encounter (phrad) him again? What must I do so that he will be at peace and happy (bde zhing skyid pa)?’ Thus he asked. Kun tu ’gro ba replied, ‘It is the law (chos) of birth and death. The history (lo rgyus) of birth and death is extremely profound. I do not understand its principle (chos tshul). Good man, go and ask Utpala, the head of the merchants, the history of birth and death.’ Having listened to these instructions, Rin chen prostrated himself respectfully, and, in search of the doctrine (chos tshul) of birth and death, continued his journey with his suite to encounter Utpala, the head of the merchants; divine tiara [vibrating] pu ru ru, jewel cymbals [sounding] si li li, and various harmonious drums [resounding] ti ri ri. Now, here is the parallel passage from the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra: (pp. 187-2) Then, Sudhana, son of the head of the merchants, remembered clearly Acal\u0004 (Mi g.yo ba), the ‘Immovable’, the     person or indigenous that which we cannot determine with certainty today. We have kept the Tibetan term tshangs pa in our translation because it is peculiar to our text. 22 The first part of this expression designates death and the second part rebirth in another life. This expression is used later in Tibetan Buddhist terminology as a synonym for transmigration (sa\u0005s\u0004ra)."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" THE CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH 123 woman who had taken the five vows (up\u0004sik\u0004, dge bsnyen ma) and her instructions—what she had taught, well taught, promulgated, explained, said, well said, expressed, analysed, declared and widely taught.

When he arrived at the top, where a bright light was blazing, he saw from afar Sarvag\u0004min. This ascetic was more brilliantly coloured than Mah\u0004brahma (Tshangs pa chen po), and was surrounded on all sides by ten thousand Brahmas (Tshangs pa). Sudhana went up close to him and prostrated himself. Then, he walked around him a hundred thousand times, keeping Sarvag\u0004min on his right, and then stood in front of him and said, ‘O Saint! Although I have already made the decision to attain the unequalled bodhi (anuttarasamyaksambodhi), I do not yet know what the practices and obligations of the bodhisattva are.

The extract from Chapter II of our History is a versified and much abridged version compared to that of the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, which is in prose and much lengthier. This is the reason why it is difficult, if not impossible, to understand our History without referring to its source. However, it is not simply an abridged and versified version. While the questions Sudhana asks in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra concern exclusively the practices of the bodhisattva, in our History Rin chen asks each teacher, ‘What must I do so that my father will return [to life], and so that it will be possible to encounter him? What must I do so that he will be at peace and happy?’ The reasons for the two pilgrimages are therefore completely different: our History uses the motivation of Sudhana’s pilgrimage only as a framework for Rin chen’s enquiry concerning the law of birth and death. Thus, in our History, there is almost nothing left of the content of the doctrinal discourses of the teachers as they are developed in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002ha-s\u0002tra; these discourses have but a secondary importance and are only versified skeletal extracts from the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra. If the author of the History chose the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, it was, however, not merely out of interest in the plot of Sudhana’s pilgrimage, which was so well suited to the History. In fact, the most important element of the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra that subsists in our History from Dunhuang is without doubt the notion of ‘means’ (up\u0004ya, thabs), which is brought out as we have noted in the passage cited above; in order to convert beings to Buddhism, the bodhisattva employs a wide variety of means. During his pilgrimage, Sudhana encounters many teachers who are quite different from one other. But, in spite of the differences of doctrinal discourse, they are all ‘benevolent guides’ (kaly\u0004\u0002amitra), who allow Sudhana to advance in the steps of his career as a bodhisattva; and it is this that is essential. The notion of ‘means’ (up\u0004ya, thabs), so clearly expressed in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, probably gave the author of our History a certain amount of freedom and allowed him to use and even modify the canonical texts to achieve his objective, which was to convert the Tibetans to Buddhism. Now let us take a look at other modifications that the author of the History has brought to the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra. To account for them, we have drawn up lists of the teachers whom Rin chen of our History (A) and Sudhana (Nor bzangs) of the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra (B) respect-ively visit.

As for the following three teachers, while their dwelling places remain the same in the two versions, their names have changed completely. This change deserves closer investigation. The expression khams gsum, which is in the name of the teacher Khams gsum ’phrul pa lha’i rje ‘Lord of the gods who has magic power in the three worlds’, is usually indicative of a Buddhist con-text, and this is indeed the case in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra. The three worlds of the well-known Buddhist cosmology are the K\u0004madh\u0004tu, comprising the three evil destinies (durgati) and the four continents on the earth and the first six stories of the gods, the R\u0002padh\u0004tu in"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"130 YOSHIRO IMAEDA space and the \u0006r\u0002pyadh\u0004tu on top of it. However, because of the expressions sa ’og in Sa ’og lha ’dre rje ‘Lord of the underground diabolical deities’, and bar snang in Bar snang dbang chen ‘Great powerful one of the intermediate world’ that follow, it seems more likely that khams gsum in our History refers to a tripartite division of the universe as the ether, the earth including the underworld, and the intermediate realm (= the atmosphere). Since ancient times, these are the three stages which constitute the Tibetan universe, which is vertically divided into three parts: the gods (lha) above, diabolical divinities like the klu below, and humans in the middle.32 In this way, following just the etymology of the names of these three teachers of the History, and not those of their dwelling places, which remain the same as in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, we adduce that Rin chen, leaving his divine country (situated without doubt in the upper sphere), goes first to the place of the Lord of the gods who has magic power in the three worlds and who also probably resides in the upper world. Then he descends to the lower world, to the place of the Lord of the underground diabolical deities, and finally arrives at the intermediate stage where the human beings dwell. This signifies for Tibetans that his pilgrimage covers the entire universe. After the dialogue with the first four teachers, Rin chen follows on the whole the same terrestrial itinerary—though much short-ened—as does Sudhana in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra. The absence from list A of the teacher Lha’i bshes gnyen ma (26th in list B) may have been a mere oversight on the part of the author of our History, but the presence of the word lha ‘god’ in the name can also be considered as a reason for her omission from the History of Rin chen. For, as we have seen, starting with the fourth teacher, Bar snang dbang chen, they are all earthly teachers, with \u0003\u0004kyamuni as the last one whom Rin chen goes to see. It is probably the presence of the word lha ‘god’ in the name of Lha’i bshes gnyen ma (although the word is employed here to render the Sanskrit word vasu in the name Vasumitra of the Sanskrit original) which led the author of the History to exclude it. As for the change of order of Rgya mtsho’i rgyal mtshan from seventh position in list B to 26th position, just before \u0003\u0004kyamuni, in list A, it can perhaps be explained by the fact that among the countries of the teachers of the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, his is the only one which is specifically situated in Jambudv\u0005pa. The insertion of \u0003\u0004kyamuni of Magadha in Jambudv\u0005pa as the last of the teachers of   32 MACDONALD 1959: 419-20 and STEIN 1962: 22, 170."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" THE CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH 131 our History, in order to replace Avalokite\u0006vara (Spyan ras gzigs dbang phyug) in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, would have obliged the author of the History to place Rgya mtsho’i rgyal mtshan, also from Jambudv\u0005pa, just before \u0003\u0004kyamuni, which makes the itinerary of Rin chen more logical from a geographical standpoint. It should be noted, however, that all the teachers of the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra in fact are in Jambudv\u0005pa. This must have been obvious for someone familiar with Indian Buddhist cosmology. The change of order of the teacher Rgya mtsho’i rgyal mtshan in list A implies that the author of our History did not know Indian geography, and this is one of the grounds for the hypothesis which we will develop below, according to which the author was Tibetan. From what we have seen so far, we have here a fine adaptation of the pilgrimage of Sudhana in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, but with a fundamental difference between the two versions. In the Ga\u0002\u0003a-vy\u0002has\u0002tra, Sudhana’s visit to the various teachers is of paramount importance; each teacher contributes precious teachings concerning the practices of the bodhisattva, which is the main purpose of Sudhana’s quest. In our History, however, all of the teachers whom Rin chen visits, apart from \u0003\u0004kyamuni, despite their virtues, are incapable of answering the fundamental questions Rin chen asks about the law of birth and death. It is precisely their inability that is underlined over and over throughout the pilgrimage. After all, the pilgrimage of Rin chen, and therefore all of Chapter II, is only one element—quite interesting from a literary point of view but completely secondary in the end—in the organisation of our History. After Chapter II, in which the pilgrimage of Rin chen is narrated, what follows in the History is a description of \u0003\u0004kyamuni and of his country (Chapter III, 1), and the discourse on the inevitable nature of death (Chapter III, 2a). These are not taken from the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002ha-s\u0002tra and are original compositions of the author. He tackles the fundamental question of death, about which Rin chen had asked at the beginning of the History. The author has the Buddha declare that all beings, even the gods, die (Chapter III, 2b). He condemns certain funeral rites (Chapter III, 2c) and in the end recommends, without pronouncing it, however, the formula of U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005, as the remedy against death (Chapter III, 2d). It is likely that the author of the History is alluding here to pre-Buddhist religion, whose followers practised very elaborate funeral rituals in order to send the deceased to the land of the Dead, where they would live happily until their resurrection. In our History, the author declares these funeral rites to be useless and replaces them with rites centred on Buddhist formulæ."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"132 YOSHIRO IMAEDA Some of the passages that we have just surveyed are extracts from Buddhist texts. For example, in Chapter III, 2b, \u0003\u0004kyamuni reveals the number of years allotted to the various categories of beings, from human beings to the Naivasa\u0006jñ\u0004-n\u0004sa\u0006jñ\u0004yatana gods who reside at the top of the \u0006r\u0002pyadh\u0004tu world. This theory of the lifespan of beings is not alien to Buddhist cosmology, as it is discussed thor-oughly in the Abhidharmako\u0007a,33 and we even know a s\u0002tra entitled \u0006yu\u0004paryantas\u0002tra (Tshe’i mtha’i mdo, P no. 973)34 that deals exclusively with the subject. The list of our History is only an abbreviated and schematised version of this theory and even contains some errors (see below). As for the passage concerning the merits of the formula of U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005 recommended by \u0003\u0004kyamuni at the end of the History (Chapter III, 2d), it is in fact an abbreviated and reordered extract of the text which is found shortly before the end of the U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005-dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003 (P no. 198, vol. 7, pp. 167-5 to 168-4).35 The aim of this canonical text is, as the epithet of one of its Tibetan versions (P no. 198), Sarvadurgatipari\u0005odhana, Ngan ’gro thams cad yongs su sbyong ba, indicates, to ‘purify all the bad destinies (durgati)’ in order to allow its followers to avoid them.36 As is clear from this epithet, this dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003 has the same objective as the Sarvadurgati-pari\u0005odhanatantra. From what we have seen until now, we can say that our author must have used the composition of the Sarvadurgatipari\u0005odhana-   33 LA VALLÉE POUSSIN 1971, tome II: 171-74. 34 The passage that concerns us is found in P vol. 39: 62-3 to 64-2. 35 There are five different translations of this text in the current Kanjur: P nos. 197 to 201. As for the formula (dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003) itself, it is almost identical in all the versions. As far as the composition of the translations is concerned, we can divide them into two groups: 1) no. 198 in which the son of the Shin tu brtan pa (Suprati\b\thita) gods and Indra appear, and 2) nos. 197, 200 and 201 in which they are absent. No. 199 is a sort of combination of the two groups; it belongs rather to group 2 but an episode involving Shin tu brtan pa that is found in no. 198 is inserted in the middle of it in a completely abrupt and illogical way. No. 198 is the only ancient translation (translated by Jinamitra, Surendrabodhi and Ye shes sde), and is therefore the only one that is present among the Dunhuang manuscripts—PT 6, 54, 74 and 368. The formula (dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003) itself is present in PT 72, 73, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, IOL Tib J 322 (not in the Tibetan transliteration of the Sanskrit dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003, but in Tibetan translation), and 348 (?). The dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003 is also well represented among the Chinese Dunhuang manuscripts. Cf. FUJIEDA 1960. 36 The copyist of the PT 397, for example, copied the formula ‘in order to acquire merits, not to fall into the bad destinies (durgati), and to reach the dwelling of Amit\u0004bha’ (Inventaire, I: 99)."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" THE CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH 133 tantra, and that he has inserted into the History elements from other Buddhist texts and arranged them in an original way with some modifications. We have noted three instances of this: the pilgrimage of Rin chen, the theory of the lifespan of beings, and an extract from U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005-dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003. With regard to the first case, it is certain that the pilgrimage of Sudhana (Nor bzangs) in the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra served as the model. As for the second case, it is difficult to tell on which text the author of the History based his work, because the theory of the lifespan of beings is a part of Buddhist cosmology that is well attested in various Buddhist works. It is possible that further passages were inspired by, or contain quotations from other texts that we have not been able to identify. After this rapid overview of the History, we cannot help but notice with surprise that the formula of U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005, which should be the culmination of the text, is absent. Is this absence simply due to forgetfulness on the part of Chos dbyangs, the copyist of PT 218? We will come back to this question later.

The Lord of this world (de’i khams rje) was called ’Od ’bar rgyal, ‘King of Blazing Light’. The dwelling place that he occupied ...39 was made solely of light and shone dazzlingly bright. Everything above and below it was reflected in it as in a mirror. Both the sun and the moon decorated the ‘hole of the stars’ (skar khung).40 The feeling of well being and comfort given by this country was beyond description. Food and treasures appeared whenever one wished. Everything there was made of magical materials. The light emanating from the body [of ’Od ’bar rgyal] blazed like gold. His thousand sons, ten thousand parents and all his retinue had the same magical power (’phrul stobs)41 as he. Everybody hoped to remain thus forever (rtag du).42 2. One day the life of ’Od ’bar rgyal was exhausted and the moment of the fall arrived for him. His magical power (’phrul stobs), his indescribable virtues (yon tan) and the beautiful blazing light of his body disappeared (yal). He stopped speaking, moving or breathing.43 Everyone found it extraordinary and asked each other what was the fault and what was the law. Nobody knew the meaning of the law (chos don). His thousand sons, ten thousand parents and all his retinue were plunged into an ocean of suffering and, beating their bodies, showed the signs of the most profound sadness. They wished that the king would return [to life] and be as he was before (slar ’ong sngon bzhin yod du re). 3. There was among the gods a god named Dutara who was quite old and who had great magical power (’phrul chen). He came to the residence of ’Od ’bar rgyal and declared, ‘You are in error.

There, in front of the mah\u0004bodhi tree, the Buddha \u0003\u0004kyamuni was dwelling [by his supernatural ability] in the sky, at the height of seven t\u0004la trees. He was sitting on a throne of jewels, surrounded by many beautiful lights forming a rainbow. The [eighty] marks of excellence (anuvyañjana, dpe byed bzang po) were dazzling, and the thirty-two characteristics (lak\u0004a\u0002a, mtshan) adorn-ed his body. His parasol covered the ten thousand countries in the ten directions. The canopy, made of a net of jewels, was opened. The smell of excellent incense floated according to the movement of the wind, (folio khna, recto) and it was raining celestial flowers. In the air, numerous ascetics (\b\u0004i, drang srong) and ‘science-holders’ (vidy\u0004dhara, rig ’dzin) were flying here and there and were praising \u0003\u0004kyamuni with numerous and pleasant words. Bodhisattvas possessing magical power (byang chub sems ’phrul ba), all the gods of each stage between heaven and earth, human beings, non-human beings, ‘birds of prey’ (garu\u0003a, nam mkha’ lding), ‘serpents’ (uraga, lto ’phye), ‘sirens’ (ki\u0006nara, mi ’am ci), animals and the departed (preta, yi dags)—everyone was listening respectfully to his teaching (chos). \u0003\u0004kyamuni was truly turning the wheel of the Law (dharmacakra, chos kyi ’khor lo), and the Law that he was preaching was understood by all according to their capacity of understanding. Rin chen, good son (dge ba’i bu), was much intimidated and extremely frightened, and started to shiver and his hair began to stand on his head. He was unable to ask for the teaching (chos tshul).

The son of gods stood up in the crowd.

Joining his hands, and kneeling down, he asked respectfully, with his head down, ‘My father, a god possessed of form (gzugs yod lha), is called ’Od ’bar rgyal. As his life has been transferred and he has changed bodies, what must I do so that he will become like he was before, and what should I do so that it will be possible to encounter him? What must I do so that he will be happy (bde ba)?’ Thus asked Rin chen. 2a. The Bhagavat replied, ‘Is it the law (chos) that you want to ask me? Think this over well and listen to me attentively. In the three worlds (khams gsum), everything that is born dies. Birth is due to the power of acts (karma, las). Dying is also subordinated to acts. When the moment of the law of birth and death arrives, all the gods of each stage between the sky and the earth fall, and all who have great magical power (’phrul chen) and numerous powers (mthu) release them. Everything that exists in the three worlds dies sooner or later. As everybody dies in this way, there are at every moment more and more people in Hell.

All who are considered to be knowledgeable among the beings of this world do harmful acts in the hope that these acts will remedy (phan) [death.

Some who are ignorant and in error say that if one puts the corpse on the top of a trident (tri\u0007\u0002la), it remedies [death].83 Some say that if one realises the mantra (sngags) of the brahmans (bram ze), it remedies death. Some says that if one observes the four heretic (mu stegs) laws, and one makes offerings, (folio ngna, verso) it is good for death. Some say that if one practises the law of a ’gur ma (= ? a gur ma, “singers”) and one realises its meaning, it remedies death. Some say that if one practises the law of the god of the fire (Agni), it remedies death. Some say that if one buries together with the corpse all the objects that belonged to the deceased, it remedies death. Some say also that if one sacrifices a horse, a buffalo (ma he, mahi\u0004a), a goat and a sheep for the deceased, it remedies death.

All bad actions that one has committed in the past can be purified only by various good actions. An act such as killing others (pha rol) committed in the past can be purified by the practice (chos) of “not killing but nourishing”. All the erroneous practices are purified by the gift of the Law. All the passions, like desire (r\u0004ga, ’dod chags) and hatred (dve\u0004a, zhe sdang), are purified by the gift of the Law that leads to the other side. All the powers of the diabolical deities (lha ’dre) are subjected by the blessing (byin rlabs) of the Three Jewels (triratna). Thus, if one practises the law of good actions (dge ba’i chos), it remedies death. Furthermore, one can be born a god, move all the bodhisattvas, liberate oneself from all sin. Virtue is indescribable. The law that remedies death has clearly been preached by innumerable Buddhas of the past. (folio kma, verso) If one practises this law that remedies death, by practising the great formula (dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003, gzungs sngags), one can be born where one wishes. Here, therefore, is the formula of Gtsug tor rgyal ba, the “Formula of the victorious cranial protuberance”; for the deceased whose life is exhausted, one has to practise it according to the ritual.84 ‘The tantrist (sngags mkhan) wears a white cloth, recalls mentally the formula (dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003), and makes a square ma\u0003\u0004ala.

Thus, escaping from the three evil destinies (durgati)—hell, the destiny of the animals (folio khma, recto) and the world of the Lord of death, that is to say, the world of the departed (preta)—the deceased will be born in the superior sphere (svarga, mtho ris). ‘[Even if one cannot practise in such a complete way], all the practices concerning this formula are beneficial; writing, contemp-lating, reading, explaining [to others], reciting, offering and deposit-ing in a st\u0002pa. ‘[On the other hand] if one attaches the formula to the top of a standard, and one places the standard either on a high mountain or on the roof of the house, by the simple fact of seeing it, being touched   84 What follows is an abbreviated and reordered extract of the text found shortly before the end of the U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003 (P vol. 7, no. 198, plates 167-5 to 168-4). 85 Refer to DE JONG 1983: 224."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"166 YOSHIRO IMAEDA either by its shadow, by the dust that touched it, or by the wind that touched it, all the harmful causes are purified; hell is rejected, the passions (nyon mongs, kle\u0007a) are annihilated together with the sufferings of the worlds of the animals and those [in the world] of the Lord of death, that is to say, the departed (preta).

[The manuscript has been] copied and revised by Chos dbyangs. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HISTORY AND OTHER TIBETAN TEXTS FROM DUNHUANG As we have noted, the formula of U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005 that the Buddha \u0003\u0004kyamuni recommends and to which the whole History leads is absent from the text of the History. It is incomprehensible that the text seems to end here. About this, two hypotheses are possible. The first one would be to conceive of our History as a sort of Tibetan introduction to the Indian U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005-dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003, which was already well represented among the Tibetan manuscripts from Dun-huang (refer to n. 35 above). This hypothesis is not entirely satis-factory, because it does not explain the elements that we have noticed in the course of our study, namely, the presence of the word le’u ‘chapter, part’ in the title of the History (see p. 110), the two syllables bsngo’ ba at the beginning of the third line of the verso of folio khma of PT 218 after the colophon of the History (p. 112) and the presence of the Lha yul du lam bstan pa ‘Account of the way [which leads] to the country of the gods’, a text written twice on the verso of the text of our History, on PT 366-367 and IOL Tib J 151 (pp. 115-16). The second hypothesis is to understand our History as the first part of a more important whole at the end of which the formula (dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003) is presented. The two syllables bsngo’ ba, situated after the colophon of our History, could be the beginning of a new le’u ‘chapter’, which would be the second chapter of this larger work. As for the Lha yul du lam bstan pa, it would constitute the third and last"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" THE CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH 167 part of the same. Let us now examine the relationships between these elements and how they support this hypothesis. The Lha yul du lam bstan pa has been studied by LALOU (1938, 1949).86 The text written on the other side of the same manuscript, PT 239, designated by the term bsngo ba ‘substitution’, has been studied and translated into French by R.A. Stein.87 Finally, Madame Ariane Macdonald has studied both of them in a new perspective and demonstrated their close relationship (MACDONALD 1971: 373-76). The first phrase of the text of the Lha yul du lam bstan pa, ‘de nas gshin lam bstan pa’, ‘Then, the account of the way of the deceased’, and the fact that PT 733, the last folio and back cover for PT 239, furnishes the end title Lha yul du lam bstan pa rdzogs so ‘End of the Account of the way [which leads] to the country of the gods’, establish the reading order of these texts as follows: first the Bsngo ba and then the Lha yul du lam bstan pa. The first Bsngo ba, or ‘Substitution’ text, has six paragraphs. It is addressed directly to the deceased and indirectly to the living who perform the funeral rituals. At the beginning of each paragraph, the author indicates the pre-Buddhist term that should be ‘substituted’. They are the ring gur, ‘tent of the corps’, dbon lob ‘maternal relatives’, and the ’phru sangs, ‘pure grains’, terms the precise meaning of which we still do not understand. In addition, there are the skyibs lug, ‘sheep of shelter’, rta, ‘horse’ and gnyen sris g.yag, ‘yak, respect (part?) of relative’, which are the psychopomp animals used in the funeral rituals of the pre-Buddhist religion. The author condemns their use and recommends in their place Buddhist rituals, in particular the recitation of the formulae of the gods, lha’i sngags (mantra, dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003), without however specifying which one. We should recall that \u0003\u0004kyamuni in our History warns Rin chen against certain reprehensible practices like the sacrifice of animals   86 Up to now, we have identified five manuscripts (complete and incomplete) of this text: PT 37-III, 239, 366, 367 (these two fragments are counted as one), 733 and IOL Tib J 151. 87 STEIN 1970. In addition to the manuscripts already identified—PT 239 and IOL Tib J 504—we can add PT 37-V and I. O. vol. 56, fol. 25, which contain a part of the text. J.W. DE JONG (1983: 224) understands the word bsngo ba in a purely Buddhist context as ‘to transfer the merit’. However, our text is not written in an exclusively Buddhist environment, so such an interpretation is out of context, and does not take into consideration the religious situation of ancient Tibet. Our text is written in the climate of Tibet when it was undergoing the process of “Buddhicization”. In the context of funeral practices of the period, bsngo ba specifically means replacing one practice by another, as demonstrated by STEIN (1970)."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"168 YOSHIRO IMAEDA such as horses, buffaloes, goats and sheep (Chapter III, 2c, p. 169). It seems that the text develops this passage of our History so as to better adapt it to the religious context of ancient Tibet, and that it can be considered as a supplement to the History. Finally, in the second text, the Lha yul du lam bstan pa, the author presents three formulae whose recitation allows the deceased to avoid the three evil destinies (durgati): those of Avalokite\u0006vara, Gaganagañja and, above all, that of Durgatipari\u0006odhana, the import-ance of which we will explain in this context. At the end it presents the path to follow in order to arrive at the holy country of the gods, the place of perfect peace and happiness (bde skyid phun gsum tshogs pa’i lha yul dam pa). The formula of Durgatipari\u0006odhana, ‘Purifier of the evil destin-ies’, is in fact the fundamental formula (rtsa ba’i rig pa)88 presented in the Sarvadurgatipari\u0005odhanatantra, a text that is well represented in the Tibetan manuscripts from Dunhuang (see above n. 17). As the title clearly indicates, the aim of this tantra is to ‘purify all the evil destinies’, an aim it shares with the U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005-dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003 (cf. p. 135). Thus, it is not the formula of the U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005 announced in the History that we find at the end of the Lha yul du lam bstan pa, but the fundamental formula of the Sarvadurgatipari\u0005odhanatantra, which shares the same end. The copyist probably preferred the fundamental formula of the Durgatipari\u0005odhana, because, having a common purpose, it is far shorter than that of the U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005.

The formula announced by \u0003\u0004kyamuni in our History was later replaced by the fundamental formula of the Sarvadurgatipari\u0005odhanatantra, which, as we have noticed earlier (pp. 122-23), is plausibly the source of inspiration for the framework of our History. In the latter, as we have seen, Rin chen, son of the gods, is frightened by the sudden death of his father, ’Od ’bar rgyal, ‘King of Blazing Light’, whereupon he departs on a pilgrimage in order to find a solution to the situation. He asks a series of teachers, ‘What must I do so that my father will return to life, so that it will be possible to encounter him and so that he will be at peace and happy?’ In the Sarvadurgatipari\u0005odhana-tantra, it is a god named Vimalama\u0003iprabha (Nor bu dri ma med pa’i ’od), ‘Pure Jewel Light’, who dies suddenly, and it is Indra who then asks the Buddha, ‘O Lord, where is he reborn? Is he exper-iencing happiness or sorrow?’ (SKORUPSKI 1983: 5) In both texts, one is confronted with death and inquires about the whereabouts and the situation of the deceased. Given the thematic similarity between the two texts (even the presence of the word ’od, ‘light’, in the names of the deceased characters in both), we may propose that the author of the History might have used the Sarvadurgatipari\u0005odhanatantra as a source of inspiration and adapted it to his History. However, in the current state of our knowledge, we cannot consider the supposition of a trilogy consisting of our History, the Bsngo ba and the Lha yul du lam bstan pa as completely demonstrated, because no manuscript has yet been discovered that gives the three texts together and in the order that we have proposed. For these reasons, we are reduced to conjectures, though our working hypothesis seems to be the only theory that satisfactorily explains the designations written on the folios—Bsngo ba and Lha yul tu lam bstan pa—which are apparently independent of our History, as well as the word le’u ‘chapter’ in the title of the History, and finally, the mystery of the formula of the U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005 announ-ced but not presented in the History itself.

When the unexpected death of ’Od ’bar rgyal occurs, nobody knows how to remedy (phan) the new situation. Therefore, thinking of the sufferings (mya ngan) of his father, and fearing that he will not reach the place of happiness and peace (bde skyid gnas), Rin chen, the excellent son of ’Od ’bar rgyal, departs on a pilgrimage in search of the law of birth and death. Rin chen asks each teacher, ‘What must I do so that my father will return [to life], and so that it will be possible to encounter him? What must I do so that he will be at peace and happy (bde zhing skyid pa)?’ As we have seen (p. 122), the attitude of Rin chen in this situation is exactly the one that the pre-Buddhist religion recommended to its followers in the face of death and life after death. The response of the Buddha \u0003\u0004kyamuni is extremely interesting to analyse. After a brief discourse on the theory of the retribution of actions (karman), and on the inevitable nature of death for all beings, he condemns certain funerary rituals [including animal sacrifices] by saying, ‘Fools, the ignorant and those who are in error practise all the erroneous laws in the hope of remedying (phan) death. Be aware that everything they practise produces only harm and never remedies (mi phan) death.’ Then he announces, without actually revealing it, the formula of the U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005 and presents its rituals as the only reliable means to avoid falling into the evil destinies (durgati) and to attain the superior sphere, the place of peace (bde ba’i gnas). So ends our actual History, which relates the search for the means to remedy death from the Buddhist point of view. The Buddhists, in fact, found themselves face to face with a population submerged in the indigenous religion. It was impossible to impose new ideas on them in an abstract way and so it was therefore necessary to employ an appropriate ‘pedagogical method’. It is this that led to the creation of the story of Rin chen that, situated in a time qualified by the use of ‘formerly’ (p. 137), could be used as a ‘story of origin’, an example of the efficacy of Buddhism in the search for a remedy against death. Let us turn now to consider the author of our History. No manuscript provides any information on this subject. The colophon of PT 218—the only copy that contains the end of the History—mentions only the copyist. Aspects of the text, such as the presence of a Sanskrit title, its use of canonical sources of Indian origin and the anonymity of the author may give the impression that this is an Indian s\u0002tra translated into Tibetan. The analysis and the reading of"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" THE CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH 171 the History demonstrate, however, that it can only be the work of a person very familiar with the Tibetan milieu. The presence of the Sanskrit title does not, of course, suggest that our History might be a translation of a Sanskrit work. As we have seen, this ‘Sanskrit’ title does not make much sense and is most probably a fiction similar to those we find in the ‘apocryphal’ s\u0002tras. Furthermore, we have to remember that the History, together with all its canonical sources that were originally written in prose, was entirely composed in verses of seven syllables. In addition to this, we find typically Tibetan onomatopoeias of three syllables like pu ru ru, si li li and ti ri ri, literary flourishes that are rarely found in works translated from other languages. It appears therefore more probable that the History was written by a Tibetan-speaker who was also well read in the canonical Buddhist texts from which he derived some of his source materials. Furthermore, the History includes several additional elements that are undeniably Tibetan. We have already seen that, after the death of his father, Rin chen is concerned above all with his achievement of happiness in a new life, reflecting the attitude that the followers of the pre-Buddhist religion took when faced with death and life after death. This element of our History surely reflects the religious climate of ancient Tibet. The modifications that the author made to the passages taken from the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra that we have studied are also most significant from this point of view. The names of the first three teachers whom Rin chen encounters have been completely changed. Thus in our History they are respectively named Khams gsum ’phrul pa lha’i rje, ‘Lord of the gods who has magical power in the three worlds’, Sa ’og lha ’dre rje, ‘Lord of the underground diabolical deities’, and Bar snang dbang chen, ‘Great powerful one of the intermediate world’ (p. 133). The etymology of their names shows us that this change has been made so that their names cover the entire universe according to indigenous Tibetan conceptions. The other modifications that we have noticed (pp. 131-35) were also made in the same spirit, aiming to adapt the Indian sources to the Tibetan milieu. All these observations reinforce our hypothesis according to which the author of the History was a Buddhist Tibetan. Given the fictional title in Sanskrit attested in IOL Tib J 345, we can rightly consider our History as a kind of Tibetan ‘apocryphal’ s\u0002tra. As for the date of the text, we can only suggest a hypothesis, for want of substantial evidence. The actual state of our paleographical knowledge unfortunately does not allow us to establish a chronology of the Tibetan manuscripts from Dunhuang. They date from the"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"172 YOSHIRO IMAEDA seventh to the tenth century, but no dating from the material condition of the manuscripts is possible. Therefore, we rely on indications internal to the History itself. The author has used, as we have seen, several Buddhist texts of Indian origin, all of which were translated into Tibetan no later than 824, for the Ldan kar ma Catalogue of Buddhist texts compiled in this year mentions them all: the Ga\u0002\u0003avy\u0002has\u0002tra, no. 24; \u0006yu\u0004pary-antas\u0002tra, no. 284; the Sarvadurgatipari\u0005odhanatantra, no. 323; the U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005-dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003, no. 348; and the Abhidharmako\u0007a and similar texts, nos. 686-691.90 But, on the other hand, we have noticed that several Buddhist terms do not follow the Buddhist terminology laid down in 814 in the Mah\u0004vyutpatti (pp. 119-20). Taking these elements into consideration, we are probably not wrong in saying that our History was written in about 800, a period that follows the acceptance of Buddhism by the royal court of Khri Srong lde btsan and the foundation of Bsam yas Monastery, the first monastic complex of Tibet, events that did not, however, lead the Tibetans immediately to abandon their pre-Buddhist ancestral religion. CONCLUSION As we have seen at the beginning, there are in the Tibetan manuscripts from Dunhuang nine copies of our History, which is rather a large number for a single text, apart from some cases of canonical texts. It is evident therefore that our History, notwith-standing some inexactitudes from a purely doctrinal point of view, was well accepted in the Tibetan world of the period, and must have been intended for wide circulation. We will not reconsider the theme of the History, but in the eyes of the followers of pre-Buddhist religion, it demonstrated the efficacy of Buddhism in the search for a remedy against death. In the Bsngo ba, the ‘Substitution’ text that follows the History, the funeral rituals that had primordial importance in pre-Buddhist religion are rejected and substituted by Buddhist practices. Finally, the Lha yul du lam bstan pa, ‘Account of the way [which leads] to the country of the gods’, which forms the third and last part of the whole, demonstrates that, thanks to the three formulae to be recited, in particular that of Durgatipari\u0005odhana, the deceased avoids the   90 LALOU 1953.

This is exactly the country to which Rin chen, the hero of our History, wished to send his dead father; this was the aim of all deceased persons in the pre-Buddhist religion. We can therefore make two remarks: First of all, Rin chen, the protagonist of the History, is totally immersed in the pre-Buddhist religion and hence the Tibetans of the period could generally identify themselves with him. Then, like our History, the Bsngo ba and the Lha yul du lam bstan pa are situated in the transitional period, the first stage of the transformation of pre-Buddhist rituals into Buddhist practices, for we find in these texts Buddhist formulae whose recitation is prescribed in order to reach the holy country of the gods, the place of perfect peace and happiness that belonged to the pre-Buddhist religion. Skilfully, the Buddhists did not immediately seek to alter post-mortem aims, but left in place the goal of the indigenous religion in the mind of the Tibetans, without imposing upon them an overly abstract idea of ‘life after death’. They preferred first to tackle the rituals, the means employed by the old religion, as these seemed to them most reprehensible and in total contradiction with Buddhism, for they included the sacrifice of animals and even humans. At the same time, the Buddhists tried on the one hand to find in the terminology of the pre-Buddhist religion usages that accorded with Buddhist doctrine (for example phan), and, on the other, to transpose indigenous notions to more or less similar Buddhist concepts (replacing, for instance, dga’ dang skyid pa’i yul with bde skyid gnam or lha yul). Outside India, its land of origin, Buddhism was able to make itself accepted in many countries by responding to certain of the concerns and traditions of the various social groups that it encountered. This was the case in Tibet, where Buddhism first acclimatized itself and then overcame the indigenous religion, determining forever the destiny of the Tibetan people. It is extremely difficult to know which elements of Buddhism were advanced for this purpose by the first disseminators, because there existed in Tibet at this time extremely variable Buddhist trends—Indian as well as Chinese, Mah\u0004y\u0004nist as well as Tantric. In fact, the Tibetan manuscripts from Dunhuang demonstrate the extreme variety of the facets of Buddhism that were already translated into Tibetan. It will be therefore only when we have achieved a thoroughgoing, minute examination of the Dun-"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"174 YOSHIRO IMAEDA huang archive that we will be able to understand more clearly how Buddhism penetrated the Tibetan world. Nevertheless, the examination of the texts that we have analysed here already reveals a significant dimension of the story: because of the preoccupation of the followers of pre-Buddhist religion with death and life after death, and the common aim of the two canonical texts—the U\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0004avijay\u0005-dh\u0004ra\u0002\u0003 and the Sarvadurgatipari\u0005odhana-tantra—used in our Buddhist booklets directed against pre-Buddhist beliefs, we can say that one of the aspects of Buddhism on which the first disseminators insisted and to which the followers of the indigen-ous religion were very receptive was the comforting side of the theory of transmigration (sa\u0005s\u0004ra), that is to say, the prospect of being reborn as a god or at least to avoid the evil destinies. This is, from a doctrinal point of view, however, far from the supreme aim for the follower of Buddhism. COLLATED TRANSCRIPTION OF CHAPTER I Doubtful readings are given in italics.

"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" ORAL TEACHINGS AND WRITTEN TEXTS: TRANSMISSION AND TRANSFORMATION IN DUNHUANG Sam van Schaik THE WORLD OF THE MANUSCRIPT Manuscripts, far more than printed texts, can be born out of a variety of situations. A manuscript can contain anything from hastily scribbled notes to a fine copy of a revered scriptural text. Every manuscript is different from every other, differing in the circumstances of its creation and in the idiosyncrasies of its creator. Manuscripts, in their great variety, have much to tell us about the mutability of the text. The relative stability of printed editions leads us to think of textual changes as occuring at certain stages in the transmission of a text, generally when it is edited for a new printed edition. Manuscripts show us a much more fluid situation. While cataloguing the Dunhuang manuscript collection at the British Library, I have been struck by a number of manuscripts that are distinguished by a particularly poor quality of handwriting and orthography. It might be argued by those familiar with the Tibetan Dunhuang manuscripts that poor handwriting and wild orthography are the norm, rather than the exception. There is indeed a surprising degree of variation due to the differing circumstances of each manuscript’s creation, but this does not entail an orthographic free for all. The Tibetan Dunhuang manuscripts fall into identifiable groups, among which we might place at one end of the scale the thousands of carefully copied and corrected s\u0002tras which were the products of organized scriptoria working during the Tibetan imperial period. Here orthographic variations are at a minimum and have been eradicated as much as possible in the editorial process. In the middle of the scale are the manuscripts that have been copied carefully, but outside of the scriptorium and usually without revisions. Most of these would have been for personal use, and contain texts like short treatises, prayers and collections of spells. At the other end of the scale are the manuscripts I am concerned with here, noticeably more"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"184 SAM VAN SCHAIK scruffy in appearance than those that occupy the middle of the scale. The individual letters are poorly formed, as if by the hand of a child, and lines veer away from the horizontal. Orthography varies quite noticeably more than in the bulk of the Tibetan Dunhuang manuscripts, several different spellings of the same word sometimes appearing even within the same manuscript.1 The initial temptation is to leave these manuscripts well alone, and spend one’s time with more beautiful specimens. However, forced to confront them in my cataloguing work, I began to notice similarities between them that led me to think that they were not merely the discarded work of some novice in the Tibetan language.2 In this paper I will be exploring the theory that these manuscripts are artefacts of teaching situations, specifically when a student sits and takes down the words of a teacher. The teacher might be giving a general lecture, or reciting a text from memory. The student might be particulary quick with a pen, and copy nearly every word, or only manage general summaries. He or she might have been present at the teaching, but only written it down from memory when ink, paper and tranquility were available. But in any of these cases, there are certain things that happen that do not occur when a text is simply copied from another written text.3   1 The study of the palaeography of the Dunhuang manuscripts is very much in its infancy, and the paleographic analysis of the Tibetan manuscripts lags behind the work that has been done on the Chinese by Japanese and French scholars. Cristina Scherrer-Schaub has identified some of the general characteristics and laid down some provisional chronological guidelines with regard to the Tibetan collections from Dunhuang and Tabo (SCHERRER-SCHAUB 1999 and 2002). Yet studies of Chinese and Tibetan Dunhuang manuscripts still rely heavily on connoisseurship. While I must admit to basing my categorizations here on visual recognition of similarities stemming from my experience with a large number of manuscripts, I have been working with Jacob Dalton and Tom Davis to develop a more scientific system for handwriting recognition based on forensic handwriting techniques. See DALTON, DAVIS AND VAN SCHAIK forthcoming. 2 As well as the evidence presented below, it is interesting that in some of the manuscripts we seem to have examples of the writer switching between a hasty, scruffy hand and a neat, ‘fair copy’ hand (for example, see Or.8210/S.95). This, and some of the other manuscripts mentioned in this paper can be viewed online on the website of the International Dunhuang Project (http://idp.bl.uk). 3 There are other possible reasons for the poor quality of the writing that do not necessarily imply oral transmission, one of which is that the texts were written by a scribe or scribes who did not have Tibetan as a first language (and thus would most likely have been Chinese). Another possibility is that the poor hand indicates that the writer was not a professional scribe, and turned to writing only when the situation demanded it. Of course, neither theory excludes the possibility that the manuscripts are records of oral transmission."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"ORAL TEACHINGS AND WRITTEN TEXTS 185 TEACHING AND TEACHERS IN DUNHUANG To begin with, I would like to look at the evidence that teaching situations in which texts are transmitted and written down did occur at Dunhuang. Dunhuang was in its heyday one of the great centres of Buddhist practice, art, scholarship and translation. Situated on the edges of the Chinese and Tibetan cultural spheres, and at the eastern end of the Silk Route, it received a huge cultural input. From the eighth to the tenth centuries, Dunhuang contained resident monastic communities of Chinese, Tibetan, Khotanese and Turkic monks.4 There was also a steady flow of eminent teachers passing through Dunhuang. Chinese Buddhists would stay awhile as they began their pilgrimages to India, and Indians and Tibetans would stop off on their way into China. Evidence is found among the Dunhuang manuscripts of high-status Buddhist teachers travelling in both directions. For example, in the Stein collection we have a kind of passport for a Chinese monk who was on a pilgrimage to visit N\u0002land\u0002 in India. The manuscript contains a series of letters of introduction written in Tibetan, apparently in the tenth century. The Chinese monk passed through the Tibetan-ruled areas south-east of Dunhuang before arriving there.5 We also have the well-known Pelliot tibétain 849, a long scroll that ends with an account of the journey through Tibet to China of an Indian teacher called Devaputra. The main part of the scroll contains thematic glossaries in Tibetan and Sanskrit which, as Matthew Kapstein has suggested, were probably compiled by a local Tibetan with the help of Devaputra himself.6 A less well-known but equally fascinating manuscript is a phrasebook containing a series of bilingual conversations in Khotanese and Sanskrit. Among these conversations are some that speak of pilgrims coming from Khotan and India to see the bodhisattva Mañju\u0003r\u0004 in China.7 Another conversation mentions the arrival of a travelling Tibetan teacher. Most interestingly, one of the   4 See TAKATA 2000. 5 IOL Tib J 754. The letters in this ‘passport’ have been discussed in THOMAS 1927, and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper by myself and Imre Galambos. There are several other Duhuang manuscripts concerning pilgrimage routes, written in Chinese; for example Or.8210/S.353 and Or.8210/S.529. 6 Pelliot tibétain 849 was first transcribed and translated by Joseph Hackin in 1924. It was recently revisited in a study by Matthew Kapstein (KAPSTEIN 2006). 7 The destination would have been Wutaishan, famed throughout the Buddhist world as the dwelling-place of Mañju\u0003r\u0004."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"186 SAM VAN SCHAIK phrasebook’s dialogues contains a series of questions from Person A about which books Person B owns.8 ‘S\u0005tra, Abhidharma, Vinaya, Vajray\u0002na,’ is the answer, followed by the question ‘Which do you like?’ ‘I like Vajray\u0002na; teach it!’ comes the very definite response from Person A.9 It is not clear whether Person B, the one with the books, is supposed to be the travelling pilgrim or a local monastic librarian. In either case, we get from this phrasebook a sense of a place where Buddhist texts and teachings are frequently passed back and forth between travellers and the local population. We also get a sense that the newest genre of teachings, Vajray\u0002na, is in the highest demand. An immediately striking characteristic of those manuscripts that I am suggesting may be records of teaching situations is that many of them are recycled. The scribe has used a Chinese scroll and written on the blank verso side.10 One such scroll [see fig. 3] is written on the verso of an almanac composed for the year 956. The scroll would have been re-used after the almanac was no longer needed and before the library cave at Dunhuang was sealed sometime in the early eleventh century. This is persuasive, though by no means conclusive, evidence that most of the similar manuscripts that I will discuss here are also from the tenth century. Most of these re-used Chinese scrolls are incomplete Buddhist texts. We know that scrolls like these were collected by a librarian at the monastery in Dunhuang where these manuscripts originally came from.11 The scrolls were meant for repair, but it seems that they were also used as a stock of scrap paper for recording teachings. ORAL TRANSMISSION The study of oral traditions in the West has been a very productive field throughout the last century, and many of its insights can be profitably applied to Buddhist texts. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Francis James Child of Harvard University recorded hundreds of popular ballads that had been handed down   8 Book here translates p\u0002staka in Sanskrit, and pustya in Khotanese. From these words are derived the Hindi pothi and perhaps the Tibetan dpe cha as well. 9 Pelliot 5386: [l.29] s\u0002tra av\u0003darma v\u0003naya vajrray\u0004na / s\u0002ttra av\u0003darma v\u0003n\u0003va vajrray\u0004na [l.32] mama vajrray\u0004na k\u0005amatt\u0003 \u0006aik\u0005apaya / vajrray\u0004na k\u0005amai parya v\u0004 p\u0002\u0005\u0007ai. 10 The palaeographic term for this is opisthograph. 11 See RONG XINJIANG 2000: 260, 263."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"ORAL TEACHINGS AND WRITTEN TEXTS 187 orally through several generations.12 Several decades later, another Harvard professor, Milman Parry, developed a sophisticated structural analysis of oral poetry, taking Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey as his basic material. Parry developed the theory that oral texts rely on formulas. That is, they are composed of hundreds of prefabricated metrical phrases that the poet can stitch together.13 This lends a repetitive character to the text that will be familiar to anybody who has read a Buddhist s\u0002tra. After Parry’s death, the curator of his collection of oral literature at the Harvard College Library, Albert Lord, continued Parry’s work, adding his own research on the ballad singers of contemporary Yugoslavia.14 Lord found many of the characteristics of Homer’s texts in the ballads of these illiterate singers showed how the ballad singers did not memorize a text word for word, but as formulas arranged around conventional themes. And he showed that an oral text has no set length, but can be extended or shortened depending on the context of the telling. Lord’s research was based on individuals or cultures on which literacy had yet to have an impact. His method-ology was later taken up by anthropologists such as Jack Goody, who collected data and defined the characteristics of what came to be known as primary orality, that is, the features found in oral cultures where literacy has had little or no impact. There have been some moves to apply the oral-formulaic theory of Parry and Lord to the earliest phase of Buddhist literature, where primary orality may well be a relevant concept. Some have seen traces of oral composition everywhere in early Buddhist scripture.15 Others have questioned the wisdom of applying Parry and Lord’s theory to the Indic world, pointing out that Indic Buddhists seem to have applied a much more rigid memorization and transmission   12 The ballads were published in a series of volumes (the tenth and last published postumously) of English and Scottish Popular Ballads between 1882 and 1898. 13 This illuminates the etymology of the Greek word from which we derive our rhapsodize (rhaps\bidein: ‘to stitch together a song’). 14 Albert Lord’s seminal work is The Singer of Tales (LORD 1960). 15 The oral character of texts from the Pali canon was first discussed by Lance Cousins (COUSINS 1983), who has recently returned to the subject in the 2005 Numata lecture series at the School or Oriental and African Studies. The same topic has been further discussed in GOMBRICH 1990, COLLINS 1992 and GETHIN 1992. Donald Lopez has discussed the possible application of orality studies to early Buddhist literature, and suggested that the Mah\u0002y\u0002na s\u0002tras also display the signs of oral composition and transmission that have been identified in the Pali scriptures (LOPEZ 1996: 44-45)."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"188 SAM VAN SCHAIK structure than the improvising bards of European cultures.16 Some have attacked the very foundations of the Parry-Lord theory: Paul Griffiths’ Religious Reading offers a particularly robust and well-supported criticism.17 In any case, theories based on non-literate societies will be of limited use to the study of literate cultures like Tibet, where we want to examine the ongoing oral transmission of texts within a literate culture.18 There seems little use in debating the accuracy of a model that was designed for primarily oral cultures when we are dealing with the persistence of oral transmission within a context of literacy. I would argue that much more fruitful comparisons may be made with the literature and practices of medieval Europe, where oral transmission remained a strong element within a literate culture. José Cabezón’s comparative study of Tibetan and European medieval scholasticism, Buddhism and Language, made the case for common ground in terms of scholastic practice, and Cabezón has more recently applied the same comparative method to the concepts of authorship and composition in Tibet.19 A comparison of the practices of memorization and transmission would be equally illuminating. Without attempting any such thing here, I will occasionally point to comparable situations in the medieval European context. Most contemporary Tibetan teachers still insist on the necessity of a ritualized permission to read a text in the form of a recitation of the text by the teacher. Great importance is also attached to the oral commentary on any transmitted text. The persistance of orality in present-day Tibetan Buddhist education and scholasticism has been discussed in the context of Dge lugs pa scholasticism by Anne Klein   16 LOPEZ (1996: 32–41) has discussed the disjunction between the workings of oral cultures as proposed by followers of Lord and Parry’s theory like Jack Goody on the one hand, and the verbatim memorization that is thought to have been the method of transmitting the Vedas on the other. GETHIN (1992) has mentioned that the memorization of lists by Buddhist M\u0002tik\u0002s runs contradictory to modern theories of orality, which exclude list-making. And finally, WYNN (2004) has challenged the whole premise of Cousins by disputing the existence of textual evidence for improvisation in early Buddhist scriptural recitation. 17 GRIFFITHS 1999: 28–34. 18 In describing a culture as literate here, I do not mean to state anything about the extent of literacy, only that literacy was to be found among the majority of the scholastic and ruling classes. The extent of literacy in Tibet was briefly discussed in EKVALL 1964: 124, and recently in DREYFUS 2003: 80–82. It is also worth noting that some recent writers have argued that primary orality itself may be more of a scholarly construction than a reality. See FINNEGAN 1998: 139–74. 19 CABEZÓN 2001."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"ORAL TEACHINGS AND WRITTEN TEXTS 189 and George Dreyfus in their accounts of contemporary practice.20 And it is not only in the contemporary scene that oral transmission can be shown to play a vital role. Leonard van der Kuijp has argued for the importance of oral transmission throughout the history of Tibetan Buddhism, citing, among other interesting Tibetan sources, a passage from the fifteenth-century Sa skya master Go rams pa, in which the phrase ‘mere book’ (dpe cha tsam) is used to describe a text for which the oral transmission has died out. Van der Kuijp summarizes the relationship of oral transmission to written texts in Tibet in a paragraph that is worth quoting in full: As such, the text as a concrete and public manifestation of the tradition in question played a relatively subordinate role to the teaching and learning process, and only served as a point of departure, as a means and not an end in itself. Its life was given and sustained by a steady interaction between itself and these processes, regardless of whether the latter took place in a more or less continous fashion, or in solitary retreat with only infrequent interruptions. In this way then, it is clear that when a lineage that had been previously grounded in oral transmissions was for whatever reason no more, this interaction ceased and the pulse of the text came to an abrupt halt. It was only at this time that it became possible to reduce the lineage and the oral transmission inspired by it, to what it never was, to a ‘mere book’.21 A fascinating glimpse of early Tibetan attitudes to oral transmission is found in Bu ston’s Practical Guidance on the Five Stages, written in the fourteenth century. The passage concerns a vow laid upon Bu ston’s lama not to write down the oral precepts he received from his own lama. Bu ston writes: My lama said: ‘Writing down the precepts of the oral transmission is much like a king being brought down to the level of the masses and wandering through town.

And as for wisdom, your pupils will have the reputation for it without the reality: they will receive a quantity of information without proper instruction, and in consequence be thought very knowledgeable when they are for the most part quite ignorant.25 The parallels between the two passages are obvious. Most striking is the anxiety that the written text will become a substitute for true wisdom.26 Jacques Derrida used Plato’s words as a jumping-off point to explore the privileging of the oral over the written throughout Western intellectual history.27 Though van der Kuijp’s     pa’am grong du rgyu ba dang ’dra ste/ nyes dmigs che zhing gdams ngag mthu dang phan thogs chung ba yin/ yi ge ris de byung phan chod lag len gyi dmar khrid rtsad mi gcod par yi ge de thob pas shes rab byed cing / mjug tu bklag lung du ’gyur pas don la gdams ngag rabs ’chad du ’jug pa zhig ’dug / Thanks to Kurtis Schaffer for pointing out the translation of this passage in ROERICH 1949: 424, n. 5.

Without attempting to extend Derrida’s critique directly to the Tibetan scene, one can perhaps see parallels in Tibet to the distinction perceived in ancient European discourse between ‘good writing’ (wisdom represented by the book, ultimate reality by mantric syllables, and so on) and ‘bad writing’ (the ‘mere book’).28 The status of writing and of the text as physical artefact through Tibetan history is certainly a complex subject that deserves a proper study. In any case, I think we can say with some certainty that oral transmission has remained a vital aspect of Tibetan religious culture through most of its history. I now return to look at the impact that oral transmission has had on the texts themselves.   ERRORS OF HEARING I have been exploring a method for identifying instances of oral transmission that is based on the difference between manuscripts that have been copied from other manuscripts, and those which are records of an oral teaching. The difference is found in the errors of the scribe who wrote the manuscript down. This is because errors produced by mistakes of the eye may be distinguished from errors produced by mistakes of the ear.29 This has become clear to those who have attempted to process the vast amounts of ballad and folksong material collected by Frances James Child and his successors. The various different versions of a particular song that are found in this collection point to a ‘distortion complex’. The distortion comes about when either the performer or the scribe recording the performance attempts to understand what they have heard in terms of what they think they have heard. It should be possible in theory to distinguish the variations caused by oral transcription from the mistakes of the copyist. The most familiar scribal mistake is haplography, also known as eye-skip, the result of the copyist missing an entire passage because the next passage begins or ends with the same syllables. The complement to 28 DERRIDA 1981: 149. 29 I have chosen these terms in preference to W.E. Richmond’s scribal error and typographical error (RICHMOND 1961).

Neither of these errors should appear in a transcription from an oral source. The mistakes of the ear are transformations that seem to make most sense in an oral transcription, primarily mistakes caused by homophony. For example, Child collected several versions of a Scottish song called The Gypsy Laddie (a popular ballad which, incidentally, travelled to America as The Gypsy Davy and was recorded under that title by Woody Guthrie, among others). Version C of the ballad, which was recorded from a Scottish source, contains the line: As soon as they saw her weel-faurd face They coost their glamourye owre her. Here the word glamourye is an archaic Scottish term for a spell, clearly unfamiliar to later singers in England, where Version G was recorded: As soon as her fair face they saw They called their grandmother over.30 Admittedly this is an extreme example; other errors of hearing that are less amusing but still significant appear throughout the variant forms of the ballads.31 I believe that these forms of distortion or transformation may also be identified in our Dunhuang manuscripts.   30 This song is no. 200 of Child’s collection; the versions are C and G respective-ly. These lines are cited in RICHMOND 1961. 31 The same kinds of error have also been observed in European medieval manuscripts. See CHAYTOR 1945: 19–21. Chaytor uses these errors to argue that the scribe did have a manuscript to copy from but was affected by the habit of reading aloud, a habit that was almost universal in the medieval period. But this view (prevalent since the nineteenth century) has been disputed in CARRUTHERS 1990: 170–1. More recently, John Dagenais has set out a series of ‘registers’ to describe the way scribes change texts as they copy them. Among these are the linguistic register and the register of discourse, which in simplified terms refer to the tranformative effect of the scribe’s expectations regarding the language and subject-matter of the text (DAGENAIS 1994: 136–37). These registers cause transformations in copies made from manuscripts similar to those found in transcriptions of oral sources. However in the manuscripts discussed below the transformations are so much more pronounced than in most Dunhuang manuscripts that the explanation of oral transmission seems worth pursuing."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"ORAL TEACHINGS AND WRITTEN TEXTS 193 THE VERSIONS OF OVERCOMING THE THREE POISONS I began to explore the possibility of identifying errors of hearing in the Dunhuang manuscripts when I looked at three different versions of the same text that appear in three different manuscripts, all written in the scruffy handwriting that I mentioned earlier. The text, Overcoming the Three Poisons (Gdug gsum ’dul ba), is a prayer relating instructions for the moment of death. The prayer is best known for containing the earliest identified instance in Tibetan of the o\t mai padme h\u0002\t mantra.32 All three versions of the text are different. The differences may simply be due to the fact that the texts are derived from different sources, but I would like to tentatively propose that there is a preponderance of differences that indicate scribal mishearings. If so, this suggests that at least one version of the text was taken down from an oral source. To keep it simple I shall only compare two of the three versions here [see fig. 4]. Let us look at a short extract as it appears in these two versions: Version 1 IOL Tib J 421: 1v.1–5 Version 2 IOL Tib J 420: 1r.1–9 1 2 3 4 5 6 /sdus byas skya ma’I lnga phung bzhig/ /e ma myI rtag slu ba’I chos/ /gzha mtshon sgyu ma yod las myed/ /sprIn tshogs na pun snang las thIm/ /ngo mtshar rmad kyIs glub bar gyur/ /bden las rtsun gyI stan byang ba’/ /dus byas sgyu ma’i lnga phung zhig / /e ma myen tog bslu ba’i chos / /gzham mtshon sgyu ma yod las myed / /sprin mtshogsna bun snang las thim / /phon mtshan smad kyis glug bur / /bden las rtsun du sdun byung ba’i / Close Homonyms (Prefixes and Suffixes) The easiest error to make when writing down an orally delivered text is to mistake one homonym for another.

So the   32 See IMAEDA 1979."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"194 SAM VAN SCHAIK simplest differences we can identify are those where the prefixes and suffixes change. For example, in l. 1 of the two versions, the syllable sdus appears with its prefix sa in Version 1 and without it in Version 2. On the other hand, in l. 4 the syllable tshogs appears with its prefixed ma in Version 2 and without it in Version 1. Such differences in later Tibetan printed texts are often ascribed to variations in local dialect, or simply to the lack of standardized orthography. Regional variations at least are unlikely to be the culprit here; the similar form of the manuscripts (both are in codex or booklet form), the quality of the manuscript paper, and the fact that the manuscripts were found in the same bundle in the Dunhuang cave, make it most likely that we are dealing with two versions of the text produced in the same place at around the same time.33 The lack of a standardized orthography may be at fault, though the differences between these two versions are much more pronounced than one usually sees between two manuscript versions of the same Dunhuang text. In any case, the next kind of variation cannot be the effect of mere orthographic deviations. Distant Homonyms: Errors of Interpretation As well as variations on the level of the single syllable, we come across variations where the scribes have made a more interpretative error. Rather like participants in the party game ‘Chinese whispers’, they have heard one word as another. We can see this in l. 2 where Version 1 speaks of phenomena being delusory and impermanent, while Version 2 speaks of phenomena as delusory flowers. Here the scribe of Version 2 has probably misheard myi rtag (‘impermanent’) as myen rtog (‘flower’). On l. 5, the scribe of Version 1 has written the word ngo mtshar (‘wonderful’), and then the word rmad (‘marvellous’) which function here as adverbs. The scribe of Version 2 has written the word phon (‘bundle’) followed by the word mtshan   33 The Tibetan manuscripts in the Dunhuang cave were found in rather chaotic bundles mixed with manuscripts in other languages such as Khotanese or Sanskrit. Aurel Stein used his archeological ‘site numbers’ to number the manuscripts according to their original bundle. Unfortunately, Paul Pelliot, a brilliant textual scholar with little interest in archaeological procedures, did not number the manuscripts he obtained in the same way. The Stein bundles do seem to contain some coherent groups of manuscripts, and Tsuguhito Takeuchi has begun to explore dating the bundles using the few datable manuscripts in each bundle.

Some of the other major homophonic variations between the texts that make slightly better sense than this might well survive to be passed further along the chain of transmission. Our analysis of homophony does beg the question of how Tibetan syllables were pronounced in tenth-century Dunhuang. Unfortunately, the main evidence for this is the Dunhuang manuscripts themselves, so we are in danger of getting involved in a circular argument.34 Nevertheless, since we must begin somewhere, these homonyms do give us more clues than we have ever had before about how the Tibetan language was pronounced at this time (at least in Dunhuang). There are similarities to modern pronunciations, and little evidence for the theory that all prefixes and suffixes were pronounced in early Tibetan and only gradually became silent. The following are a few examples taken from various manuscripts: IOL Tib J 420, 421: khu equivalent to gru IOL Tib J 716, R1: thol for ’khrol IOL Tib J 716, V1: yogs for g.yogs IOL Tib J 37/2: gom pang for go ’phang IOL Tib J 384, throughout: -gs ending often changes to -s ending IOL Tib J 754, l. 1: ja corrected to bya; l. 27: ca corrected to phyags [see Appendix] Major Variations In some cases, the differences between the versions cannot be explained by a simple mishearing of homophones. I have taken the following extract as an example:   34 Steven Beyer has written insightfully on this topic, based on a limited group of previously transcribed manuscripts (BEYER 1992: 28-36).

One possibility is that these manuscripts were not after all written down at the same oral teaching, but derive from variant versions. The multitude of homophonic variations would still be enough to show that at some point at least one of the texts was transmitted orally. But we still should not rule out the possibility that the two manuscripts derive from a single teaching situation. The major variations between these texts usually occur, as here, at the end of a line of verse. If a scribe happens to be falling behind the recitation, it is the ends of the lines that are more likely to be lost. Most of us will be familiar with the difficult simultaneous practice of listening and recovering from memory that is required when taking down notes from an oral presentation. If anything is lost it is more likely to be the ends of phrases than the beginnings. Rather than leaving phrases unfinished, one inserts plausible words. We would expect that, unlike the mishearings discussed above, such substitutions should make some sense in the context, and the end of line variations in these manuscripts do generally make sense. A similar principle may be behind the variation we find in the famous six syllable mantra of Avalokite\u0003vara: Version 1 IOL Tib J 421: 12v.7 Version 2 IOL Tib J 421: 12v.7 o\t ma nI pad me hu\t myi tra swa h\u0004/ \b\t ma ma ni pad me / /hum mye/ It’s clear at first glance that neither of these versions is the simple six syllables of the famous mantra.

The mantra occurs towards the end of the text,"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"ORAL TEACHINGS AND WRITTEN TEXTS 197 and the scribe of Version 2 appears to have been succumbing to fatigue. He inserts some unecessary punctuation in the middle, and then falls behind and cannot catch the last part of the mantra. Mistakes like this would have been common among scribes who knew little or no Sanskrit, and this is likely to have been a frequent cause of variations in the transmission of mantras. COMPLEXITIES OF ORAL TRANSMISSION As mentioned earlier, there are three manuscript versions of the text of Overcoming the Three Poisons. How might they have come to be? The picture that first occurred to me is of three students sitting at the feet of the teacher, scribbling away as he speaks. We know that in medieval Europe, before the widespread use of the printing press, university students had no textbooks, and had to rely on their own written transcriptions of lectures. Surely monks and lay practitioners at Dunhuang, attending the lectures of visiting or resident teachers, would also have had to create their own copies of the text being taught.35 Visiting teachers in particular, who would not be travelling with a large personal library, would often be teaching from memorized texts. We know that Indian Buddhist teachers tended to rely on memorized rather than written texts in India through to the fifth century, based on the account of the Chinese pilgrim Faxian, who reported his difficulties in finding any written copies of the fundamental Vinaya texts that he wanted to bring back to China.36 That memorization continued to be greatly esteemed and revered in later centuries is shown by the Chinese pilgrim Yijing’s account of Indian teachers and students in seventh-century India.37 Furthermore, we know that the Indian and Central Asian teachers who brought texts to China often brought them in memory rather than as written books.38 And of course, right down to the present day, memorization continues to be central to traditional Tibetan monastic education, which conforms   35 The necessity for university students in medieval Europe to write their own manuscripts of texts, and their reliance on dictation is discussed in HAJNAL 1959: 65–68. 36 GILES 1956: 64. 37 TAKAKUSU 1896: 182–83. 38 See SANDER 1992: 141–42, and CH’EN 1964: 366–67."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"198 SAM VAN SCHAIK with most pre-modern educational cultures in the belief that texts must be made one’s own through the memorization process.39 Memorization in itself may account for some of the variations discussed in the previous section. As Mary Carruthers has noted in her major study of memory in medieval Europe, the memorization of texts unites written with oral transcription, and eye with ear.40 The memorized text may undergo changes in the mind of the one who has memorized it before he or she has even recited or written it down. Therefore, it is usually difficult to tell from the manuscripts whether a text had been transformed in the mind of the teacher, or by the hand of the listening scribe. One of my university professors in English literature once recited in class the first stanza of Robert Herrick’s On Julia’s Clothes thus: Whenas in silks my Julia goes, Then, then (methinks) how sweetly flows That liquefaction of her globes. On reading the poem a few days later I realized the last word of the stanza is actually clothes. The poem had undergone a minor transformation during its residence in the mind of the professor, and had I not had access to printed editions of the work I would have retained and perhaps passed on this subtly altered version of the poem. Note that, as in some of our examples from Overcoming the Three Poisons, the substituted word in this case retained the vowel sound of the original word. There is a further reason why textual variations are spread by travelling teachers teaching from memory: if the traveller soon moves on, there is little chance to revise the rough transcriptions of his teachings. Any fair copies would tend to replicate many of the mistakes of the rough drafts, and thus carry on the signs of oral transmission. I have found some plausible examples of fair copies from the rough drafts, in which it does appear that the scribe has attempted to correct the rough draft but has reproduced of some of the characteristic mistakes in the original.41   39 The best study of this is DREYFUS 2003: 79–97, who writes (p. 92): ‘Scholars must have an active command of the texts that structure the curriculum, not simply the ability to retrieve information from them. Knowing where bits of information are stored is not enough: the texts must inform one’s thinking and become integrated into one’s way of looking at the world’. 40 CARRUTHERS 1990: 122. 41 IOL Tib J 440 may be a fair copy of a text in PT 37. And IOL Tib J 420 (our Version 2 of Gdug gsum ’dul ba) may well be a copy from PT 37 as well."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"ORAL TEACHINGS AND WRITTEN TEXTS 199 A fair copy like this, ultimately derived from an oral teaching, might later be used in a teaching situation, and be transmitted orally once again.42 Thus the chain of textual transmission goes on, composed of a mixture of written and oral links. Even where there are clear signs of oral transmission, it does not necessarily mean that the actual manuscript we are studying is a direct transcription of an oral teaching. Studies of ‘orality’ as against ‘literacy’ in textual composition and transmission have progressed in recent decades to an acknowledgement that there is no theoretically clear distinction between these two modes in any society where both reciting and writing are practised. The authors of a study on medieval French Jongleurs have summarised this complexity very effectively: But it is also possible (and probably more common) for an extant manuscript to represent in part the effects of both written and oral transmission. For example, a written copy of a written copy of an oral performance of a written copy of an original composition could differ from another version of the same poem because of both scribal modifications and oral improvisation.43 As this kind of complexity has come to be recognized, in recent years the theoretical opposition of oral and literate transmission central to the earlier work of Marshall McLuhan and Walter Ong’s much-read introduction to the subject has been criticised at some length.44 All this is to say that, having identified the characteristics of oral transmission in a manuscript, we must not leap to the conclusion that the manuscript in front of us is directly derived from an oral teaching. The transcription of the oral teaching may only be just one link, and not the most recent one, in the chain of transmission.     Furthermore, PT 849, the record of the teachings of Devaputra, looks like a fair copy that has been made without the help of the teacher, who might have corrected many of the Sankrit renderings. 42 Such a situation in the context of Theravada Buddhism is described in COLLINS 1992: 129. 43 QUINN AND HALL 1982: 6. A similar point has been made by J.M. Foley in his survey of the field (FOLEY 1984: 5). 44 See for example, CARRUTHERS 1990 and FINNEGAN 1998. These recent developments in the study of oral traditions have been summarized in MILLS 1987."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"200 SAM VAN SCHAIK EXTENDING THE STUDY The method I have outlined is as yet experimental and will need to be applied to a much greater range of manuscripts if its usefulness is to be confirmed. A wider application of the method is theoretically possible. If we are to take the presence of homophonic variation as an indication of an oral source (if not actual proof) we can broaden our search to cases where we have one copy of a text. In several manuscripts written in the rough hand that I mentioned above, variant forms of the same syllables crop up, sometimes in their correct form, and at other times switching prefixes and suffixes or collapsing into a purely phonetic rendering. Unfamiliar sounds like foreign words are transcribed very eccentrically. In one interesting manuscript, which looks like notes taken during a teaching on how to construct certain ma\u0006\u0007alas (IOL Tib J 384), the first ma\u0006\u0007ala is said to have come from the country of Dravi\u0007a. This unfamiliar Indic word is written differently each time it appears: r10.1: ’dra byi tra r10.1: tra byid tra r13.1: ’dra byid tra The particular susceptibility of place-names to this type of error has been noted with regard to the Child ballads.45 Furthermore, elsewhere in the same manuscript we have a repeated use of the word bo de swat twa (a poor transcription of the Sanskrit bodhisattva) for a divine personage who features in a story about the origin of one of the ma\u0006\u0007alas. The reason for the use of this mistranscribed Sanskrit term (rather than the Tibetan byang chub sems dpa’, which is in general use throughout the Dunhuang manuscripts) may be that the teacher whose words are recorded here was using the Sanskrit term, which was taken by the scribe to be a personal name for this character in the story. The particular form in which the Sanskrit word is transcribed would have been affected by the teacher’s pronunciation. Poor transcription of Sanskrit terms is also a feature of Pelliot tibétain 849, as noted by Matthew Kapstein. As mentioned above, Pelliot tibétain 849 probably represents notes taken from an Indian teacher by a Tibetan who was unfamiliar with Sanskrit.46   45 RICHMOND 1961: 229–31. 46 KAPSTEIN 2006. As Kapstein notes, some of the apparent mistranscriptions are not in fact based on Sanskrit, but on a variety of early New Indo-Aryan."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"ORAL TEACHINGS AND WRITTEN TEXTS 201 The subject matter of the manuscripts in the rough hand that I have grouped together here is overwhelmingly tantric. As the phrasebook says, ‘I like Vajray\u0002na; teach it!’ Most of these teachings are in the class of Mah\u0002yoga, at that time the highest class of tantra. But there is also a significant group of texts that, like Overcoming the Three Poisons, draw upon a Yoga tantra, the Sarvadurgati-pari\u0006odhana.47 The main theme of this tantra is, as the title suggests, liberating beings from the lower realms. There are many differences between the two canonical versions of the text, one of which is from the earlier period of translation, and the other of which is from the later.48 The confusion surrounding the transmission of the tantra, which was discussed in Tibetan sources, suggest that the tantra and texts deriving from it were widely taught and transformed in the process of transmission.49 Why the prevalence among these oral transcriptions of material concerned with rituals for death and the post-death state? For one thing, this kind of practical ritual would have been in high demand, both by lay people and by monks who could make use of it in services for lay people. It is in the sphere of death rituals that Buddhism came head to head with the old religious practices of Tibet, and death rituals would have been the stock in trade of many Buddhist monks.50 It is interesting that Avalokite\u0003vara and his six-syllable mantra, a truly fundamental element of Tibetan popular Buddhism, also appear in these manuscripts.51 So these oral transcriptions quite probably represent the teachings that were up to date and in popular demand at the time they were written down.   47 As well as the Gdug gsum ’dul ba manuscripts, we have IOL Tib J 384, IOL Tib J 493, Or.8210/S.421, PT 37 (other texts which come after the Gdug gsum ’dul ba) and PT 296. 48 The two versions are found in the bka’ ’gyur (P. 116 and P. 117). They are discussed in WEINBERGER 2003, chapter two, and SKORUPSKI 1983. 49 VAN DER KUIJP 1992. 50 On the interaction between Buddhism and previous Tibetan religious practice in the sphere of death rituals, see STEIN 1970. 51 On the significant role of Avalokite\u0003vara in the Tibetan Dunhuang manuscripts, see VAN SCHAIK 2006. As well as the Amoghap\u0002\u0003a ma\u0006\u0007ala in IOL Tib J 348, there is a prayer invoking Avalokite\u0003vara in IOL Tib J 719. The prayer sets out a wrathful ma\u0006\u0007ala with Mah\u0002bala at the centre. The relationship between these two deities is not clear in this case, but Mah\u0002bala appears in a number of depictions of the Amoghap\u0002\u0003a ma\u0006\u0007ala from Dunhuang, including IOL Tib J 754, which also contains the monk’s passport mentioned earlier, and a Vajrak\u0004laya s\u0004dhana written in the scruffy handwriting under discussion here."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"202 SAM VAN SCHAIK THE PERSISTENCE OF ORALITY It has long been recognised that before printing became dominant in Western culture, memory and oral transmission played a crucial role.52 In a world of few books, one’s education had to be remembered, and texts were transmitted both with and without the support of writing. Although we understand that in traditional Buddhist societies memory and oral transmission continue to play an important role to the present day, we do not always follow the full implications of this fact. When one examines a large manuscript collection, one begins to see how unstable and mutable a text can be without the stabilizing influence of printing.53 It is arguably an inherent feature of manuscript culture that texts are often copied through oral rather than visual means. In a culture before print, there is no publication as we understand it. Dissemination of the text must be carried out through oral performance or teaching. As I mentioned earlier, even if the teacher is working from a written text, it would be very rare that all of the recipients of the teaching would already have their own copies. If they wanted a copy of the text, it would be necessary to make one, sometimes through the agency of sight, and sometimes through the agency of hearing. This was certainly the case in medieval Europe.54 Again in an analogy with Europe, the widespread adoption of printing technology in Tibet is likely to have limited the mutability of the text. Many later productions of Tibetan authors, which find their way quickly into print, are stablized then and there, and subsequently subject only to the errors of the copyist when one printed edition is superseded by another. Print technology certainly introduces more consistency and stability to the process of transmission. The traditional assumption that printing was not in general use in Tibet before the fifteenth century seems to be fairly accurate, even if printing technology was known to Tibetans before   52 For a recent and extensive study of this subject see CARRUTHERS 1990. 53 The great difference between the world of the manuscripts and that of printed texts has been discussed in a recent monograph on a European manuscript tradition by John Dagenais: ‘That manuscripts are different from modern printed editions is obvious enough, and yet when we have spent some time among manuscripts we being to realize just how powerful this difference is. Manuscripts are, in fact, a vital culture’. (DAGENAIS 1994: 36). 54 CHAYTOR 1945: 115–37."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"ORAL TEACHINGS AND WRITTEN TEXTS 203 that time.55 Therefore, the high level of textual transformation found in the manuscripts in this study must have continued to be a feature of textual transmission for several centuries after the period of the Dunhuang manuscripts. If there is a general conclusion to be drawn from this study, it is that the number of hands (as well as ears and eyes) involved in the formation of the text as it comes down to us is not limited to the initial period of creation, but increases at each stage of transmission. Some Buddhist texts are born into written form, and their subsequent transmission is well controlled within the monastic environment; these exhibit the least mutability.56 Others, such as Overcoming the Three Poisons, are either born into an oral setting, or achieve a popularity that propels them into multiple informal, often oral, transmissions. Dunhuang seems to have been an environment in which such informal transmissions were common, and surely it was not unique in this regard. This kind of text—popular and therefore subject to oral teaching and transmission situations—comes to us only after having passed through the agency of unknowable numbers of teachers and scribes. At each oral rendition and copying of the text, there is the opportunity for changes to be introduced by the teacher, and for further changes to be introduced, almost simultaneously, by the scribe. The older the text, the more significant this process becomes. These texts are often attributed within the tradition to the agency of a buddha or bodhisattva, and there is a temptation in the academic study of Buddhist scripture to treat this as a kind of mask hiding the face of the real, human author. Yet the fact that many such texts have passed through numerous stages of transmission, each one   55 Leonard van der Kuijp has addressed the issue of the earliest Tibetan printed manuscripts in two articles. With exceptions, which include the early 14th century Tibetan texts produced by Mongol sponsors (VAN DER KUIJP 1993) of Buddhism and reports of printed dh\u0004ra\u0003 sheets in the 13th century (VAN DER KUIJP 2003: 391), Tibetans seem to have been slow to take up the woodblock printing technology that had been in use in China since the 8th century. This seems quite within the realms of possibility when we consider that printing did not become widespread in India until the nineteenth century. 56 Thus the Indic Buddhist \u0006\u0004stra literature was relatively stable and produced few major variant texts, unlike the s\u0002tra literature. An exception that perhaps proves the rule is the Bodhicary\u0004vat\u0004ra, a \u0006\u0004stra which did circulate in widely variant versions, as witnessed by the many divergences between the canonical and Dunhuang versions (see SAITO 1993). It is likely that the immense popularity of the Bodhicary\u0004vat\u0004ra took it outside of the major monastic centres, where it became subject to more fluid transmission situations, oral as well as written."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"204 SAM VAN SCHAIK transforming them in some way, from the trivial to the profound, should make us wary of this assumption. Indeed, since the text comes to us at the end of a long chain of dependent origination, the empty forms of the buddhas and bodhisattvas may in fact be a better metaphor for agency than an imagined original human author. APPENDIX: SCRIBAL CORRECTIONS ON THE HOOF IN A VAJRAK\bLAYA S\u000bDHANA One feature of certain manuscripts, not mentioned above, is strongly suggestive of transcription from an oral source. The first syllable of the word is written erroneously, and the whole word needs to be written out again. The correction appears not in the margins or between the lines, but in the running text. Several instances of these corrections appear in IOL Tib J 754, a Vajrak\u0004laya s\u0004dhana.57 On l. 1, we see the crossed-out syllable ja followed by bya, which looks like a case of the mishearing of a homonym. Similarly, on l. 27 we see ca followed by phyags. This kind of error also occurs in PT 37, although here the scribe has not crossed out the initial erroroneous syllable. Examples are bya sbyong on f.5v and ga sgribs on f.6r. The Vajrak\u0004laya manuscript also contains corrections that may have been made after the initial transcription. The mantras, which are poorly transcribed, have also been partially corrected, perhaps later in consultation with the teacher (unlike the fair copies mentioned above): l. 18: kyi la ya kyi la ya corr. ki la ya ki la ya (k\u0003 heard as kyi) l. 19: bhug tsi ti corr. bhag tsi ta BIBLIOGRAPHY Manuscripts IOL Tib J 384: Notes on various ma\u0006\u0007alas IOL Tib J 420/1: Overcoming the Three Poisons (version 2) IOL Tib J 421: Overcoming the Three Poisons (version 1) IOL Tib J 754/1-5: Chinese pilgrim’s letters of passage IOL Tib J 754/7: Vajrak\u0004la s\u0004dhana   57 The s\u0004dhana has been discussed in MAYER AND CANTWELL 1994."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"ORAL TEACHINGS AND WRITTEN TEXTS 205 PT 37: Booklet containing several texts including Overcoming the Three Poisons (version 3) PT 849: Devaputra’s teachings Pelliot 5386: Sanskrit-Khotanese phrasebook A note on conventions for references within manuscripts: Poth\u0004 and booklets: Folio number followed by lowercase r (recto) or v (verso) to mark the side; e.g. 1r.1 Scrolls: Side in uppercase (R or V) followed by item number; e.g. R1.1 Concertinas: Side in lowercase (r or v) followed by number of panel; e.g. r1.1 Secondary sources BEYER, S.V. 1992.

Kapstein The present is the third (and presumably the last) in a series of articles consecrated to the study of Chinese traditions concerning the arhat Mulian, that is, Mah\u0002-Maudgaly\u0002yana (Ch. (Da)mu(qian)lian ፥ᖘ㊃㜩), as these are known in Tibetan sources. The first (KAP-STEIN 2001) offered an introduction to the subject, together with a transcription and translation of the Dunhuang manuscript IOL Tib J 686, in which we find a verse summary of the celebrated ‘transformation text’ on Mulian’s salvation of his mother from hell, the Da muqianlian mingjian jiumu bianwen ፥ᖘ㊃㜩⡡䈒㑳ᕴ昦ᑔ. This was followed by a more detailed study (KAPSTEIN 2007) that attempted to trace the influence of the Mulian tales in later Tibetan Buddhist literature. In both of these essays, I referred briefly to the existence of a Tibetan version of the well-known Chinese Buddhist apocryphon, the ‘S\u0003tra of the Yulan vessel’, Yulanpen jing (T 685), that had been translated during the early ninth century by the Dunhuang-based master ’Gos Chos-grub (Ch. Facheng ⌈ᜇ), who seems to have been also the author of the abbreviated retelling of the transformation text.1 Here, I present a more detailed account of the Tibetan text of the s\u0003tra, followed, in the appendix, by an improved edition of the abridgement of the bianwen given in IOL Tib J 686. The interest of the Tibetan Yulanpen jing stems in part precisely from the apocryphal status of the Chinese original.2 Though a thorough inventory of Chinese apocryphal scriptures in Tibetan translation has never been undertaken, it is safe to say that only a small fraction of such works was ever translated and that, for reasons that are not yet well understood, the Tibetans in general seem to have   1 On this figure see DEMIÉVILLE 1952, INABA 1977, UEYAMA 1983, and VERHAG-EN 1992. 2 BUSWELL 1990 provides as excellent survey of the apocryphal scriptures as a key issue in the study of Chinese Buddhism.

Although efforts were made to translate Buddhist literature from Sanskrit virtually in its entirety, the Tibetan project of translating Buddhist Chinese was remarkably restrained, so that it seems fair to ask of any given Chinese apo-cryphon that we find in Tibetan, just what may have motivated its translation? The question is easiest to answer with respect to relatively late translations, for instance, those of the Beidou jing (‘S\u0002tra of the Northern Dipper’, T 1307, Foshuo beidou qixing yanming jing\u0014ខ䦗ᔑᑕጦ▕↑Ω䔂) realized under the Yuan dynasty, or of the apocryphal \u0002\u0002ra\u0003gamasam\u0004dhis\u0002tra (‘S\u0003tra of the Heroic March’, T 945, Shoulengyan jing ⠤䍹捲䔂) and the Sishi’erzhang jing (‘S\u0003tra in Forty-two Sections’, T 784, ᕀፀጰ㝥䔂) both commissioned in the Qianlong era (1735-1796) during the Qing.3 In these cases, the interests of the court required the imperial promulgation of particular scriptures: the cult of the Northern Dipper came to play a role in Yuan rites of royal protection, while the last two scriptures mentioned occupied so central a place in the Qing-period conception of Chinese Buddhist teaching that their apocryphal origins were frankly unimaginable. For this reason, it was deemed necessary to incorporate them into the Tibetan scriptural corpus as well, as if they were authentic Indian s\u0002tras.4 The Tang-period translations are more difficult to assess. R. A. Stein has argued that some of the Tibetan translations of Chinese Buddhist works, including both Chan texts and various apocrypha, as well as certain Confucian writings, make use of a vocabulary (Stein’s ‘Chinese’ vocabulary) based on direct translation of Chinese that so closely resembles indigenous Tibetan usage that translations and   3 For the Tibetan versions of these three apocrypha, see, respectively, FRANKE 1990, STAEL-HOLSTEIN 1936, and FEER 1868. It may be noted that Stael-Holstein, while very much aware that the authenticity of the larger \u0002\u0002ra\u0003gamasam\u0004dhis\u0002tra is questionable, considers the work not to have been in toto a forgery, on the grounds that it incorporates some elements of Indian origin. Part of the larger \u0002\u0002ra\u0003gamasam\u0004dhis\u0002tra, moreover, had been translated into Tibetan already during the eighth or ninth century. As for the last mentioned s\u0003tra, Feer does not seem to have entertained the thought that the Sishi’erzhang jing might be inauthentic. 4 This is made quite explicit in the emperor’s preface to the \u0002\u0002ra\u0003gamasam\u0004dhi-s\u0002tra, translated in STAEL-HOLSTEIN 1936. In this connection, an amusing anecdote, for which I am grateful to Professor Raoul Birnbaum (UC Santa Cruz), relates that one of the later Lcang-skya khutughtus was asked by a Chinese devotee whether or not this s\u0003tra was to be considered an apocryphal work. Of course not, the hierarch replied, one finds it after all in the Tibetan Bka’-’gyur! (Though this work was included in the Snar-thang Bka’-‘gyur, the Sishi’erzhang jing, though published xylographically, seems not to have entered into any edition of the Tibetan canon.)"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" THE TIBETAN YULANPEN JING  213 autochthonous works may be on occasion confused.5 Though the evidence is unsure, tradition holds Chinese Buddhist and non-Buddhist works to have been first introduced during the time of Khri Lde-gtsug-btsan (r. 712-755), thanks to the influence of his Tang royal bride, the princess of Jincheng \u0002㒐ᡖ္ (d. 739). At the same time, however, it is certain that many of the extant Tibetan trans-lations from Chinese were produced far from the center, that is in Dunhuang, and date only to the first half of the ninth century. Contrasting with the ‘Chinese’ vocabulary, we often find in use here the standard ‘Indian’ translation lexicon, even in cases where the source language was in fact Chinese. Moreover, in some instances we find multiple translations of one and the same Chinese work—even examples in which versions using the Chinese and Indian con-ventions, respectively, are known—that were no doubt produced under differing circumstances and may have been destined for differing audiences.6 These and other variable factors caution us against hastily adopting any specific covering explication for Tang Sino-Tibetan translation. In the particular instance with which we are concerned here, however, we are in the fortunate position of being able to situate the work with relative precision, for the colophon is signed by the noted ninth-century translator ’Gos Chos-grub of Dunhuang. But, as the œuvre of this translator includes a related text, the summary of the transformation tale given below in the appendix, that was clearly intended for tibetophone Chinese use in the region of Dunhuang,7 it seems plausible that the translation of the Yulanpen jing was similarly conceived and so not in the first instance intended to augment the Tibetan translation canon at all.8 Just how it came to be transmitted to central Tibet, where it was in a sense canonized by its inclusion in the manuscript Bka’-’gyur-s as noted below, remains a mystery.   5 STEIN 1983: 209: ‘Le vocabulaire des traductions du chinois est souvent le même que le vocabulaire indigène traditionnel (archaïsant). Si le titre ou le sujet d’un texte donné n’est pas précisé, on ne peut pas dire avec certitude s’il s’agit d’un écrit indigène ou d’une traduction du chinois.’ 6 Particularly noteworthy in this respect is the Bayang jing (ጴ䈘䔂$\u0014T 2897) on which see STEIN 1983: 156-59 and passim; and EIMER 2002. 7 On the use of Tibetan by Chinese Buddhists as evidenced in the Dunhuang documents, see especially TAKATA 1994. 8 Refer to the ‘notes and comments’ on paragraph 28 below. Note, too, that our text is not mentioned in either of the surviving imperial period scriptural catalogues, the Ldan kar ma (LALOU 1953) and the ’Phang thang ma (RTA-RDO 2003)."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"214 MATTHEW T. KAPSTEIN TEXT AND TRANSLATION The Tibetan Yulanpen jing is so far known only from three of the manuscript versions of the Tibetan Buddhist canon, where it is entitled ’Phags pa yongs su skyobs pa’i snod ces bya ba’i mdo. It is text number 266 in volume 79 of the Stog Palace Bka’-’gyur manuscript,9 as catalogued by Tadeusz SKORUPSKI (1985: 144). Géza BETHLENFALVY (1982) lists it as Ulan Bator no. 314, and as Tokyo no. 266 following the handlist prepared by K\u0004jun Sait\u0004. As the Yulanpen jing was never included in the printed Tibetan canons, its occurrence in these three manuscripts (though no doubt there are others as well), all ultimately derived from the 14th or 15th century Rgyal-rtse Them spangs ma manuscript, raises some interesting questions in connection with Tibetan canonical transmission, especially in regard to the possibility that our text was to be found in the Them spangs ma itself. The reproduction of the Stog Palace manuscript is, however, the only one that I have actually been able to consult to date, so that my edition and comments are necessarily based on it alone.10 The Chinese text of the Yulanpen jing reproduced here follows the Taish\u0004 edition and my division of the work into numbered passages is strictly a matter of convenience, in order to facilitate the comparison of the two versions considered. While the punctuation of the Taish\u0004 has been left as is, it should be noted that this is often not reliable. The translation follows the Tibetan, though in one passage (no. 2), I translate also the Chinese, as the two texts are entirely independent of one another in this instance. The relationship between the Chinese and Tibetan texts, and the conventions adopted by ’Gos Chos-grub in his translation, will be discussed in the following section. For an English translation based on the Chinese text, interested readers may find it convenient to consult the work of TEISER (1988: 48-54). As STEIN (1983) has observed, Buddhist works were translated into Tibetan following two quite different types of conventions, which may be termed Indian and Chinese respectively. The former is of course better known, generally regarded as the standard, and its   9 In The Tog Palace Manuscript of the Tibetan Kanjur, Sherig Dpemzod Series (Leh, Ladakh: C. Namgyal Tarusergar, 1975-1980), 109 vols. 10 As Paul Harrison notes (correspondence, 5 February 2007), ‘Judging by the numbers of the Stog, Tokyo & Ulan Bator mss, this text must have been in Vol. Sa of the Shel dkar (London) Kanjur, which is unfortunately now missing.’"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" THE TIBETAN YULANPEN JING  215 lexicon, representing the Sanskrit Buddhist vocabulary, is in large measure canonized in the two great glossaries of the early ninth century, the Mah\u0003vyutpatti and its companion, the Madhyavyutpatti, or Sgra sbyor bam po gnyis pa. The Chinese translation conven-tions, by contrast, frequently deviate from Indian-inspired usage and appear to be less thoroughly standardized. Among Buddhist texts, this approach to translation is represented primarily in a variety of Chan documents, as well as apocryphal or popular scriptures, many preserved at Dunhuang but some known from the canonical collections as well. An additional feature of the old translations to which Stein called attention is of particular pertinence here: the so-called ‘Indian’ and ‘Chinese’ translation conventions do not strictly correspond, in the case of originally Chinese works, to the source language. In other words, some Chinese Buddhist texts were translated into Tibetan adhering closely to the ‘Indian’ system of conventions. This may be seen in certain well-known canonical works such as the Tibetan translation of Yijing’s version of the Suvar\u0005aprabh\u0003sottama-s\u0004tra (NOBEL 1958), to mention just one example.11 In some cases, as Stein also noted, we even find doublets, the same text being found in Tibetan in both ‘Indian’ and ‘Chinese’ versions, e.g., the Bayang jing, referred to earlier (n. 6). In connection with our present text, ’Gos Chos-grub’s translation of the Yulanpen jing, Stein’s findings permit us to specify that, while Indian conventions were quite closely adhered to throughout, lending to the work much the appearance of a s\u0003tra of bona fide Indian origin, at a number of key points concessions were nevertheless made to elements of characteristically Chinese usage.12 In one instance, the literal rendering of Ch. daoyan 䘤㘃 ‘eye of the path’ as lam gyi mig, this may reflect the translator’s hesitation over a term that seemed not to be part of the standard Indian Buddhist vocabulary. In another case, we find egui '㊂, equivalent to Skt. preta, translated as yi dags ltogs po. Here, though yi dags alone   11 Of course, in this case one might argue that the adherence to the ‘Indian’ conventions is fully warranted by the fact that the text in question is in most respects of genuine Indian (or, perhaps in some passages, Central Asian Indic) origin. While this is quite true, the point is rather that here and in other, similar cases, without regard to the question of authenticity, the translators of these works into Tibetan were entirely aware of the trilingual system of equivalencies, and so were quite capable of translating Buddhist Chinese so as to convey the look and feel of a text rendered directly from Sanskrit. 12 STEIN (1983: 160) remarks that ‘\u0005hos-grub ... emploie toujours le voc[ab-ulaire] ind[ien].’"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"216 MATTHEW T. KAPSTEIN would have fulfilled the normal requirements of translation, ltogs po ‘hungry’ has been added in order to retain explicitly the connotations of the Chinese term. Fuller reflections on these and other philological details will be found in the notes and comments given below. The transcription of the text that I provide here is by no means to be regarded as a critical edition. With only one of the three known manuscript versions of the Tibetan at my disposal, my aim has been only to reproduce its contents with accuracy.

NOTES AND COMMENTS 1. The Tibetan translation begins, surprisingly, with an ‘Indian’ version of the title, despite the clear indication in the colophon (no. 28) that the text is translated from the Chinese. The title as given, \u0007ryapari\bara\u0005ibhañjan\u0003ma-s\u0004tra, is clearly a calque, in Tibetan pidgin Sanskrit (e.g., pidgin bhañja for Skt. bh\u0003jana), of the Tibetan version of the title, ’Phags pa yongs su skyob pa’i snod ces bya ba’i mdo. There can be little doubt that a later copyist or editor was responsible for this addition and that only the Tibetan title was due to ’Gos Chos-grub’s original. The most important question raised by the title concerns Chos-grub’s treatment of the problematic expression yulanpen ⍔撔⚕, rendered here as yongs su skyob pa’i snod. As is well-known, the title of this s\u0003tra is based on a term, yulan or yulanpen, that does not make good sense in Chinese. Therefore, it has often been interpreted as a foreign—Sanskrit, Pali, or Iranian—loanword. The Sanskrit avalambana, ‘pendant, hanging down’, has been the most frequently suggested source, and is thought to refer here to rites for the"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"228 MATTHEW T. KAPSTEIN salvation of souls ‘hanging downward’ in hell.14 Indeed, it sometimes seems assumed that this explanation is so highly plausible, despite the absence of evidence supporting such a use of avalambana in known Indic contexts, that writers on East Asian Buddhism have on occasion written of ‘Avalambana’ as if it were an established fact that this is the true proper name of the ghost festival. The Tibetan translation of the Yulanpen jing is of interest to us in the first instance, therefore, because it provides some indication of the manner in which the title was understood by a prominent Tang-period translator in Dunhuang, who was familiar with both contemporary Chinese and Sanskrit Buddhist usage. Chos-grub’s rendering of the title may be translated The Sublime S\u0004tra entitled, The Vessel of Complete Protection. It seems quite clear that the derivation from avalambana in the meaning of ‘hanging down’ does not at all accord with this interpretation. Given the literalness with which Chos-grub translated the s\u0003tra overall, it seems implausible that he would have provided a paraphrase or approximate rendition of the title, if a Sanskrit term such as avalambana were clearly in the background. Though not therefore supporting the derivation of yulan(pen) from avalambana, Chos-grub’s interpretation of the title is nevertheless consistent with another of the proposed Indic etymologies, which holds that the source word might be the Pali and Buddhist Sanskrit term ullumpana, ‘saving, pulling out [of evil circumstances]’. (Scholars of Chinese Buddhism have often mistranscribed this as ullampana, ullambana, or even ullambhana, thereby avoiding the phonological problem posed by the replacement of the short u of the second syllable with the short a of yulanpen.) It is not at all clear, however, that Chos-grub was himself aware of this explanation; for the phrase yongs su skyob pa is used a total of four times in the text (in passages 11, 21, 24), twice as part of the phrase yongs su skyob pa’i snod = yulanpen, but twice (nos. 11 and 21) to render jiu 㑳\u0014‘to save, liberate, deliver (from distress)’. All in all, it seems more prudent to hold that ’Gos Chos-grub understood yulanpen as a set expression, referring to a vase or vessel used for rites of protection. Though this is semantically consistent with a hypothetical derivation from ullumpana, it does not confirm the fact of such a derivation. 2. The Chinese and Tibetan of the second passage are altogether independent of one another, as it is merely a question in both cases   14 See, e.g., EITEL 1981 [1888]: 185-186, sub ‘ullambana’."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" THE TIBETAN YULANPEN JING  229 of conventions used for introducing canonical scriptures. The Chinese attributes the purported translation of the work to the famous Dharmarak\u0004a of the Western Jin dynasty (265-317 C.E.), an attribution whose origins remain obscure. The Tibetan inserts the standard formula of homage to the buddhas and bodhisattvas that, following a convention said to have been adopted by the translation committees of the monarch Ral-pa-can (reigned 815-841), was to be used to introduce all Mah\ty\tna s\u0002tras. It is of course impossible to know whether it was Chos-grub or a later editor who added it in this case. 3. The opening nid\u0003na well exemplifies Chos-grub’s general strategy of employing standard expressions used for the translation of Indic Buddhist works to represent the Chinese. Thus, for instance, fo ខ ‘Buddha’ is rendered here as bcom ldan ’das ‘Bhagav\u0002n’ in accord with the usage generally adopted for the text as a whole (see also paragraphs 7, 8, 12, 17, 21, 22, 26), though there is some alternation with de bzhin gshegs pa as well (see §18 below).. Note, too, that if one strictly follows the Tibetan punctuation, which is not always a good idea, the beginning may be read ‘Thus have I heard at one time...’ It is out of place here to enter into the old dispute as to whether ekasmin samaye is better construed with the preceding or following phrase. 4. Similarly, the phrase de’i tshe ‘at that time’, though not at all found in the Chinese, is added at the beginning of the narrative apparently just in order to conform to normal stylistic conventions. So, too, Damuqianlian ፥ᖘ㊃㜩$\u0014Mah\u0002-Maudgaly\u0002yana, is granted the title tshe dang ldan pa ‘\u0007yu\u0004man’, as would be expected in a genuine Indic text. As mentioned earlier, a peculiar element in this passage is the expression lam gyi mig ‘eye of the path’, a precise rendering of Ch. daoyan 䘤㘃. In Indic Buddhist usage we might expect divyacak\bu\t in this context, Tib. lha’i mig. Chos-grub, however, chose not to interpret the text at this point and so favored instead an exact representation of the Chinese term. On the equivalence Ch. dao = Skt. m\u0003rga = Tib. lam, refer to STEIN 1983: 168. 5. Note that egui '㊂, Skt. preta, is here translated yi dags ltogs po, the final ltogs po/pa being unnecessary except insofar as it specifies the sense of the Chinese. Thus usage was adopted by Chos-grub throughout: see also passages 20 and 23. \u0014"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"230 MATTHEW T. KAPSTEIN 6. For Ch. ᑰ♡ ‘flaming coals’, Tib. freely translates me lce ’bar ba, ‘blazing tongues of flame’. 7. Ch. ₀㝕ᚅᜤ\u0014‘laid out everything as it had happened’ (TEISER 1988: 50). Tib. don ’di zhib tu ... gsol pa, ‘to present these facts ... in detail’. 9. We find here the first of five occurrences of the character xiao ᡷ ‘filial piety’ (cf. paragraphs 21, 23, 24), translated in all cases as sri zhu, for which I give ‘pious conduct’ in English, though ‘respect’ or ‘honour’ are equally satisfactory. Although the equivalence of Ch. xiao and Tib. sri zhu has been accepted for lexical purposes down to the present day (e.g., Bod rgya tshig mdzod chen mo, 2973, which gives xiaojing 䐁楶), it is clear that the Tibetan does not have the pronounced connotations of filiality that are regularly associated with the corresponding Chinese. Sri zhu pertains rather, to the proper behavior due to social superiors in general. Where Tibetan specifies filial piety in particular, some such locution as pha ma la sri zhu, ‘pious conduct toward parents’, is often employed. The translation of Ch. waidao ᕂ䘤\u0014by Tib. mu stegs can, ‘t\brthaka’, is typical of what STEIN (1983: 155, 187) holds to be the ‘Indian’ usage. In translations adhering to the Chinese conventions, we find mur ’dug pa (in later usage mur stug/thug pa), a distnction which gave rise, in Rnying ma pa literature, to two distinct types of ‘heretics’, mu stegs and mur stug. See, for example, DUDJOM RINPOCHE 1991: I.63ff. 11. This is the first occurrence of the phrase yongs su skyob pa’i chos, ‘doctrine of complete protection’ (Ch. 㑳堸᎒⌈) that no doubt supplies the basis for Chos-grub’s interpretation of the text’s title. See §1 above. 12. The Chinese and Tibetan translations of Prav\u0002ra\u0005\u0002, as ᝘⥖ and dgag dbye, respectively, though strictly synonyms, are interestingly different in their emphasis. The former, as TEISER (1988: 32) suggests, can be taken to mean ‘following one’s bent’, whereas the latter strictly denotes ‘separation from prohibition’. 13.

However, ‘hear preaching’ and ‘awaken to causality’ are perhaps best taken in this context as literal renderings on Teiser’s part of the Chinese terms for \br\u0003vaka and pratyekabuddha. For bo a\u0014= Skt. p\u0004tra, ‘bowl’, Chos-grub specifies dgag dbye’i zas, ‘food [offered] for the Prav\tra\u0005\t’.    14. The Tibetan omits Ch. ᐒ䢕噧摰 ‘six kinds of relatives’. 16. Ch. ᝘ᙱᐣᖇ\u0014‘born freely through transformation’ (TEISER 1988: 52), Tib. ji ltar ’dod bzhin du ... skye ba, ‘born as they desire’. The Tibetan recovers the sense of ‘transformation birth’ (ᐣᖇ) in the following rdzus te skye ba, ‘born miraculously’. 17. The first five characters of the Chinese text of this passage c/o䀄䆘ᤐ切\u0014are not at all represented in the corresponding Tibetan, as indeed they are not in the ‘Three Editions’ of the Song, Yuan and Ming dynasties, and in the Old Song Edition (1104-1148 C.E.) ‘belonging to the Library of the Imperial Household’ (Taish\u0004 n. 25). TEISER (1988: 52) rightly ignores the punctuation of the Taish\u0004 here and, construing this phrase with the preceding sentence, translates ‘and receive unlimited joy’. 18. For fo ខ$\u0014Chos-grub here uses de bzhin gshegs pa, ‘Tath\tgata’, instead of bcom ldan ’das. Interestingly, there does appear to be a precise semantic shift involved here, besides a mere preference for variation for stylistic reasons. The use of bcom ldan ’das appears to be restricted to occasions when the text is referring to the particular Buddha (i.e., \u000b\tkyamuni) who is Mulian’s interlocutor. De bzhin gshegs pa, on the other hand, as employed here (and in §§23, 24, 25) may be interpreted as referring to any Buddha. So, too, the two occasions (§§21, 24) on which fo is translated using the standard Tibetan rendering of buddha, i.e., sangs rgyas. These distinctions, of course, are not at all in evidence in the Chinese. 21. Here, and at §§23, 24, we find the only instances in which the expression ⍔撔⚕\u0014is actually used within the body of the text. Chos-grub translates it as yongs su skyob pa’i snod at the first and last occurrences, but uses snod alone at §23. In the present paragraph, the"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"232 MATTHEW T. KAPSTEIN second repetition of yongs su skyob pa (without the snod) expresses jiu 㑳\u0014‘to save’. 22. The Tibetan here is a paraphrase of the Chinese, not a precise rendering. TEISER (1988: 53) reads: ‘Excellent! This question pleases me very much. It is just what I would like to preach, so listen well!’ 23. ㍃ᑸᐶ፧ᑸ፧፥᝗ ⤤✀\u0014\u00145\u0014ፃᐔᝁV䒄\u0014ᕵ\u0014㐂\u0014ጱ\u00145\u0014ᝩᡷ䌡⍱\u00145\u0014‘Kings of states, princes, sons of kings, great ministers, counselors, dignitaries of the three ranks, any government officials, or the majority of the common people who practice filial compassion...’ (TEISER 1988: 53).

The first nine characters of the Chinese ខᠵ6䂃ᦔ፧䂃፦ጱ are not translated in Tibetan and, following Taish\u0004 n. 52, are absent from the same four editions of the Chinese Tripi\u0003aka mentioned in §17 above. TEISER (1988: 53) translates, ‘The Buddha told all of the good sons and good daughters...’ 26. The translation bcom ldan ’das kyis gsungs pa la mngon par bstod do, ‘they manifestly praised what the Lord had said,’ for 䤸ខ∠䦗ד教㠃ᝩ, ‘upon hearing what the Buddha preached ... [they] rejoiced and put it into practice’ (TEISER 1988: 54, italics added), probably illustrates once more Chos-grub’s effort to conform the work to relatively standard conventions for the translation of Indian Buddhist s\u0003tras, and not an actual variant in the Chinese text at this point. (The only variant recorded here, in Taish\u0004 n. 57, is the omission of the characters 䤸ខ∠䦗$ ‘upon hearing what the Buddha preached’, from the four editions mentioned earlier: §17, §24.) 27. Here, of course, there is no question of direct translation, but only of the respective Chinese and Tibetan formulæ for the close of s\u0003tra texts. STEIN (1983: 159-60) suggests that the Tibetan phrase meaning completed rdzogs so may be distinguished from a more archaic rdzogs s+ho, but, as he admits, the evidence is not entirely"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" THE TIBETAN YULANPEN JING  233 consistent. In any event, as our present text is so far known only from the late Stog copy, we cannot rely upon it for an exact record of the orthographical conventions of Chos-grub’s ninth-century text. 28. The translator’s colophon here follows the standard format and closely resembles Chos-grub’s usage elsewhere, e.g., at the close of the Yijing version of the Suvar\u0005aprabh\u0003sottamas\u0004tra: ‘zhu chen gyi mkhan po dang lo tstsha ba bcom ldan ’das kyi ring lugs ban de ’gos chos grub kyis rgya’i dpe las bsgyur cing zhus te gtan la phab pa’. (NOBEL 1958: II.334, with italics added to indicate the differences from our text.) The formal titles of mkhan po and, especially, bcom ldan ’das kyi ring lugs, reflect Chos-grub’s status in the monastic hierarchy recognized by the Tibetan imperial government and his role as a member of official translation committees. Does the absence of these titles in the colophon of the Yulanpen jing suggest, perhaps, that its translation was undertaken as an extracurricular activity? APPENDIX CHOS-GRUB’S SUMMARY OF THE TRANSFORMATION TEXT, IOL TIB J 686 The text of one folio given below is transcribed from a microfilm copy of the manuscript held in the Stein collection of the British Library. The original is written in a generally legible, but rather unattractive, cursive script. The reading of just one syllable (underlined and followed by a question mark in the transcription below) is doubtful. An additional syllable, intercalated in line a7, is printed here in small, subscript letters. The present transcription supercedes that given in KAPSTEIN 2001, the publication of which included a number of printing errors and did not distinguish gi-gu (‘i’) and reverse gi-gu (‘I’). As a translation may be found in both in the aforementioned article and in KAPSTEIN 2007, it is not repeated here. It is likely that the Chos-grub who composed this short verse summary of the transformation text on Mulian’s salvation of his mother is indeed none other than the translator of the Yulanpen jing, ’Gos Chos-grub. Although this suggests that he played a rather strong role in the transmission of the Chinese Mulian traditions to Tibet, it should be emphasized that this brief epitome was written on"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"234 MATTHEW T. KAPSTEIN behalf of a Tibetophone Chinese patron and that as yet we know very little regarding the place of the Tibetophone Chinese of Dunhuang in the transmission of Buddhism to Tibet itself. It would help if we had more precise knowledge than currently seems available concerning the circumstances of the translation and transmission history of the longer Tibetan versions of the transformation text, on which see TAKASAKI 1987 and KAPSTEIN 2007. However, the versions of that work which have become available to date offer no concrete indications regarding its provenance and the period of its composition. It seems most plausible that it is, like the present text, a mid- or late-Tang work from the region of Dunhuang.

The century following the disintegration of the Tibetan Empire (roughly 850 to 950) is usually described as the most obscure period of Tibetan history. Manuscripts recovered in the grottoes of Dunhuang at the beginning of the twentienth century, however, show a variety of religious practices that were in vogue during that time of political anarchy in Tibet. Since there was no central authority to control various religious speculations, different traditions sometimes syncretistically merged owing to doctrinal similarities. This may be seen to some extent in the teachings of Chan and of the Great Perfection (Rdzogs chen).2   1 This article is based on a preliminary version first presented at the 9th Seminar of the International Association for Tibetan Studies (Leiden 2000) and published as MEINERT 2002. It was originally prepared for publication in 2001, but during the intervening delay it was not possible to revise it as fully as I intended, owing to health problems since that time. I am grateful to Thub bstan Chos dar and to Dge bshes Padma tshe ring for their discussions of the manuscripts. 2 According to later Chinese historiography Chan Buddhism was brought to China in the sixth century by Bodhidharma and spread to Dunhuang and Tibet in the late eighth century. These developments are described further below. Rdzogs chen emerged during the early spread of Buddhism in Tibet in the eighth and ninth centuries and is transmitted down to the present as the pinnacle of the teachings within the nine vehicles (theg pa dgu) of the Rnying ma school, the ‘ancient school’ of Buddhism in Tibet. For an overview of Rdzogs chen as part of the Rnying ma system, see DUDJOM RINPOCHE 1991: 294-345; TULKU THONDUP 1997: 15-49. S. Karmay has already pointed out that similarities between Chan and Rdzogs chen led to misunderstandings about both traditions in the early period (KARMAY 1988: ix)."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"240 CARMEN MEINERT Within the corpus of Tibetan Dunhuang manuscripts we find among others two short documents demonstrating the early spread of Chinese Chan Buddhism and its Tibetan assimilation in the Sino-Tibetan border area during the early ninth through the early tenth centuries: the manuscripts IOL Tib J 689-1 (two folios) preserved in the collection of the British Library in London, and its commentary PT 699 (five folios) from the collection of the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. In 1979 Okimoto Katsumi first called attention to these two manuscripts in a short article that contained a transliteration of IOL Tib J 689-1 and identified PT 121-3 as another copy of the same text and PT 699 as a commentary on the root-text IOL Tib J 689-1.3 Even though K. Okimoto pointed out that these are important manuscripts in regard to the connection between Chan and the Tibetan teachings of Rdzogs chen, his research did not go into any further detail. In 2004, S. van Schaik and J. Dalton published an article in which they presented PT 699 as a Mah\u0002yoga commentary on a Chan text.4 The aim of the present chapter is to contextualize these two Dunhuang manuscripts in their historical and philosophical framework in order to shed new light on the relationship between Chan and Rdzogs chen thought in the ninth and tenth centuries in the Sino-Tibetan border region. I argue, first, that the root text IOL Tib J 689-1 is to be read as an instruction on the nature of mind as it is transmitted in the Chan tradition. Here, the teaching is described as ‘gazing at mind’ (Tib. sems la bltas, Ch. kanxin \u0004唧),5 and thus     For a comprehensive comparison of Chan and Rdzogs chen thought in the eighth and ninth centuries, refer to MEINERT forthcoming. 3 OKIMOTO 1992: 423-427. 4 Though VAN SCHAIK and DALTON 2004 advance a very different interpretation of these manuscripts, this demonstrates above all the fluidity of the categories of Mah\u0002yoga and Rdzogs chen prior to their codification as distinct paths to enlightenment. 5 The Tibetan past tense sems la bltas is intentionally translated in the present continuous form ‘gazing at mind’ as Tibetan Chan manuscripts from Dunhuang sometimes use sems la bltas instead of the future tense sems la blta (cf. PT 21: f. 2r, PT 823: f. 1.4). The Chinese original kanxin, for instance in P. chin. 4646: f. 135a, is clearly used in the present continuous tense (cf. DEMIÉVILLE 1987 [1952]: 43). See also n. 28 below. However, the phrase rang gi sems la bltas na/ (Lung chung: f. 115a.3) could also be translated as ‘if one has gazed at one’s own mind’ without changing the meaning in general. But because we are trying to deal with both the Tibetan translation and the Chinese original, one English translation for both terms is chosen here as a matter of convenience. I am aware of the difficulties surrounding this procedure."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"CHAN AND RDZOGS CHEN 241 pertains to the tradition of Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na,6 the Chinese advocate at the famous Bsam yas debate in the late eighth century.7 Second, I maintain that the Tibetan commentary PT 699 to the original Chan text IOL Tib J 689-1 may be seen as a reflection of the local religious situation in the area of Dunhuang. In particular, PT 699 discloses a Tibetan understanding of Chinese Chan Buddhism and provides an example of how Chan concepts were interwoven with elements from other traditions such as Rdzogs chen. Finally, this chapter will conclude with a look at how later Tibetan scholars criticized this syncretic current of Inner Asian Buddhism, which in their view appeared to be attempting to pass itself off as Rdzogs chen teaching. The great tenth-century work Bsam gtan mig sgron (The Torch of the Eye of Meditation, hereafter Torch of Meditation) by Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes,8 a treatise on dhy\u0002na and the four approaches to realization that were popular in ninth to tenth century Tibet,9 appears in its critique to be pointing exactly to the view expressed in the commentary PT 699.

Nonetheless, it had a lasting influence on the development of Buddhism in Tibet. For further references, see MEINERT 2002, 2006. 8 In dating the Bsam gtan mig sgron to the tenth century, I follow the research of KARMAY 1988: 102, who has discussed at length the Tibetan sources giving different dates for the life of Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes (loc. cit.: 99-103). 9 GNUBS CHEN 1974.

The SM is an exposition of the four following methods of realization: the gradual path (rim gyis pa) as it was advocated by Kamala\u0002\u0003la at the Debate of Bsam yas (chapter four: 65-118); the teachings of simultaneous entrance (cig car ba) as promoted by Kamala\u0002\u0003la’s opponent, the Chinese Chan Master Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na (chapter five: 118-86); Mah\u0002yoga (chapter six: 186-290); and Rdzogs chen (chapter seven: 290-494)."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"242 CARMEN MEINERT in Dunhuang in the ninth and tenth centuries. It is a palm-leaf-style manuscript which is, in respect to the paper, format and writing style, similar to other Chan manuscripts, for instance to two copies of a cycle of teachings by Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na, IOL Tib J 468 and IOL Tib J 709. These formal elements had been current since the Tibetan dominion over Dunhuang at the end of the eighth century.10 The short text given in IOL Tib J 689-1 is quoted three times in Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes’s Torch of Meditation. Here, in the chapter on the Chan school, designated as Cig car ba, our text is cited under the title Lung chung (Small Treatise),11 for which reason, following the Tibetan, I will hereafter refer to it by that name. The same chapter of the Torch of Meditation quotes another work under the title Rgya lung chen po (Great Chinese Treatise, hereafter referred to as the Great Treatise).12 This Great Treatise refers to a corpus of texts that report the teachings of Bodhidharma, the 28th Indian patriarch of the dhy\u0002na tradition, who came to be known as the first patriarch and forefather of Chinese Chan Buddhism. The title Great Treatise does not refer to a single text but rather to the contents of a series of texts.13 This is probably the reason why in Tibetan this corpus is given the general heading Great Treatise.   10 In the second half of the eighth century when the Tibetans conquered the Gansu corridor (Longyou dao 挹ᔣ䘤), moving westwards from the east, all means of communication between the central part of the Tang territory and Central Asia was cut off. As a result of that, Chinese influence, for instance, on the culture in Dunhuang diminished and was replaced by a strong Tibetan influence. Everyday items such as the thin Chinese paper were gradually replaced by items from the Tibetan cultural sphere such as the thicker Tibetan style paper. 11 SM: 144.4, 160.1, 172.2-3. 12 In the SM the Rgya lung chen po is cited four times: 130.2-3 (Rgya lung chen po), 173.5-176.5 (Ma ha yan gyi bsam gtan Rgya lung chen po), 177.5-178.2 (Rgya lung chen po), 179.1-3 (Rgya lung). 13 KARMAY 1988: 95 has earlier mistakenly assumed that the Rgya lung chen po is the title of a single text. However, what came to be known as the Rgya lung chen po in Tibetan may perhaps be identified with a collection of texts recovered from the Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang early in the twentieth century to which BROUGHTON 1999 has given the title Bodhidharma Anthology. This Bodhidharma Anthology is but one part of a larger corpus of ten texts presenting the teachings of Bodhidharma, itself in turn containing seven texts, which Broughton has named: 1. Biography, 2. Two Entrances, 3. First Letter, 4. Second Letter, 5. Record I, 6. Record II, 7. Record III (BROUGHTON 1999: 4-6). This corpus was first partly published by SUZUKI (1935) under the title Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices, and interpreted by him in SUZUKI 1936. It is preserved in different parts in the following Dunhuang manuscripts: Beijing su 99, S. chin. 2715, S. chin. 1880, S. chin. 3375, S. chin. 7159, P. chin. 2923, P. chin. 3018, P. chin. 4634, P. chin. 4795.

If so, it may not be a direct translation of a single original Chinese text, but rather a general title, indicating that this is a summary or abstract of a more comprehensive teaching or text. The question we should ask, then, is: whose teachings might be at issue in this Small Treatise? In fact, a careful comparison of frequently recurring expressions and phrases within the rather limited corpus of Tibetan Chan manuscripts reveals a great similarity between the Small Treatise and the teachings of Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na. A number of phrases referring to the method of ‘gazing at mind’ (sems la bltas, kanxin), at times even the exact words, occur in at least three other Dunhuang manuscripts attributed to Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na: (1) Bsam gtan cig car ’jug pa’i sgo (The Gate of Simultaneous Entrance into Medit-ation, IOL Tib J 468),14 (2) PT 2115 and (3) PT 823.16 Yoshiro Imaeda has shown that PT 823 is a Tibetan translation of parts of the famous Chinese account of the Bsam yas Debate, the Dunwu dacheng zhengli jue \u0006均㠵ၨ椱\u000b螂 (Ratification of the True Principle of the Mah\u0002y\u0002na Teaching of Sudden Enlightenment, hereafter called Ratification of the True Principle).17 On the basis of these manuscripts I will briefly outline the contents of the Small Treatise which provides a synopsis of Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na’s teachings,18 before turning to analyze and trace back the doctrinal     367-437.

The Contents of the Small Treatise In the Ratification of the True Principle, the most comprehensive text on the teachings of Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na, it is stated as a fundamental assumption that sentient beings are bound to sa\u0002s\u0002ra due to the ‘habitual tendencies’ (xiqi \u000e蚕) of ‘concepts of dis-crimination’ (wangxiang 㤨報).20 These habitual tendencies hinder their ‘original omniscience’ (benlai yiqie zhi 琤፰\u0014‑牆).21 Enlightenment, however, is achieved by nonattachment (bu quzhuo \u0017(1)\u0019) with respect to those deluded thoughts, regardless of wheth-er they arise or not.22 When the practitioner becomes ‘aware of their arising’ (qi jue\u001a\u001b), without grasping or abiding in them, each thought is liberation and prajñ\u0002.23 Judging from its contents, it is at this point that the Small Treatise can be linked to the teachings of Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na as exposed in the Ratification of the True Principle. The Small Treatise explains how ‘the principle of bringing about complete nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder of the aggregates’ (phung po lhag ma ma lus par yongs su mya ngan las bzla ba’i don)24 is to be realized. The meditation instruction, which also appears verbatim in the Ratification of the True Principle, 25 is as follows: Having reversed mind’s six faculties so that they do not engage in deluded objects,26 one gazes at one’s own mind (rang gyi sems la bltas, kanxin)27 and [realizes] that it has no reality whatsoever.   19 When the expression Dharma is capitalized, it is used to mean buddha-dharma, the ‘Buddhist teachings’; dharma with a small ‘d’ refers to ‘phenomena’. 20 ZLJ: f. 129b: 䀄⅒ᑈ䌣㙆〵 䌣\u0002\r∠ᒈ☶ぁᖇᜥ\rᎈ㐑䕴㙓\r; also f. 134b. 21 ZLJ: f. 134b: 䌣䘲⍱\rᄧ偓\u001cᖇᕩ⁤ጣᐘ㤥\r\u0002 22 ZLJ: f. 135a: ❡ᄧᎈ°C䄓ᖇᎈᖇ 䌣\r␳㐑䕴㙓\r 23 ZLJ: f. 135a:  䌣(労)'[...] 搦㝦'[...] ᎈ°Cᎈ᝶\r\u0002∂∂᠙▔䕴㙓㙡❡\r\u0002The equivalent Tibetan passage is PT 823: f. 2.2-3: myi bden ba’i ’du shes g.yos te tshor na/ [...] ma chags na/ sems thang re yang grol thar re re ste/ 24 IOL Tib J 689-1: f. 115a.1-2.

Because afflictions are not being minded, so nothing is to be conceptualized. In this way the objects of mind are completely purified and there is nothing to abide in.28   Through this practice of ‘gazing at mind’ the practitioner sees sa\u0002s\u0002ra and nirv\u0002\u0003a as no different: the ‘nature of primordial gnosis’ (ye shes kyi rang bzhin) is realized as being empty and even the concept of emptiness is seen to be insubstantial. Having gradually cleansed all the habitual tendencies of karma, all thoughts are ‘self-liberated’ (rang grol). By not ‘conceptualizing’ (myi rtog) the arising of thoughts, and ‘not abiding’ (myi gnas) in their non-arising, it is a meditation on the ‘inconceivable primordial gnosis’ (bsams gis myi khyab ba’i ye shes), which is ‘free from arbitrary thinking’ (bsam du myed pa).29 Thus, the essence of this teaching, which was handed down to K\u0002\u0002yapa and later to Bodhiharma, is as follows: Nonconceptuality is vividly clear, and [even this] lucidness is not conceptualized. This is the primordial gnosis of intrinsic awareness, which cannot be designated as ‘this’ [existing entity].30 Terminological Peculiarities Two phrases occurring in the Small Treatise are of con-siderable interest for their relevance in assessing the commentary PT 699 below: (1) the expression ‘reversing mind’s six faculties so as not to engage in deluded objects’ and (2) the phrase ‘to bring about complete nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder of the aggregates’.

P. Demiéville has already offered comprehensive remarks on the Chinese term fanzhao xinyuan, so we need only briefly recapitulate them here.34 Elsewhere in the Ratification of the True Principle the term fan yuan, ‘return to the source’, appears in a quotation from the larger \u0004\u0003ra\u0002gamas\u0003tra, a Chinese apocryphon that was spread in the beginning of the eighth century.35 The first commentary on it, by a certain Weique 㐵1, seems to date to the middle of the eighth century. Hence, Demiéville presupposed that Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na must have been familiar at least with the doctrine of the \u0004\u0003ra\u0002gama-s\u0003tra as it was transmitted in this apocryphon if not with the text itself.36 This apocryphal \u0004\u0003ra\u0002gamas\u0003tra holds that everything is ‘merely a manifestation of mind’ (wei xin suoxian ⠙唧慤$) and that body and mind are an actualization of the ‘miraculous mind’ (miaoxin 㥉唧), which is the ‘true essence of miraculous luminosity’ (miaoming   31 In translating this phrase, I follow the interpretation given in the Commentary (f. 2b.5), where ’khrul pa is interpreted as an attribute to yul, that is ’khrul pa’i yul (instead of ’khrul pa yul in the Lung chung).

If the practitioner is able to ‘return’ (fan ᐲ) all differentiation to its source, then he will experience non-dual suchness, the miraculous mind.37 The text further mentions the term fanyuan in connection with the liberation of the six faculties and asserts that if one faculty is turned to its source all six are liberated.38 Thus, if the original Chinese phrase ‘turning the luminosity [of the mind] towards the mind’s source’ (fanzhao xinyuan) is a gloss for the method called ‘gazing at mind’ (kanxin, sems la bltas),39 this method is meant to be an immediate return to mind’s source itself and might even be seen as a face-to-face recognition of the nature of mind. The Chinese Dunhuang manuscript Zhujing yaochao I䔂➂ᤕ (A Copy of the Essence of Various Canonical Scriptures) offers the following explanation that would seem to support this interpretation: In the Vajrasam\u0002dhis\u0003tra it is said: ‘Empty mind, being non-agitated, encompasses the six p\u0002ramit\u0002’.40 This [statement points out] the gate of the Sudden Teachings of Mah\u0002y\u0002na Buddhism.

I could not identify a similar passage in Kum\u0002raj\u0003va’s translation of the original. 38 For the Chinese, see n. 33 above. This passage seems to be wide-spread in the Chan materials from Dunhuang.

For a further discussion of the six faculties, see, e.g., Lengyan jing, T vol. 19, 123a.15-29. 39 This is clearly the way fanzhao xinyuan kanxin ␇䐙ᑈ䎗✂ᑈ has to be read in ZLJ: f. 135a. However, DEMIÉVILLE 1987 [1952]: 78 interprets the term zhao as ‘illuminer, refléter, regarder, connaître’ and gives the following French translation: ‘Retourner la vision vers la source de l’esprit, c’est “regarder l’esprit” ...’ On the contrary, in what is probably the most comprehensive research on the teachings of Heshang Moheyan in recent years, GÓMEZ 1983: 93, though paying close attention to Demiéville’s œuvre, interprets this very passage differently and proposes: ‘To turn the light [of the mind] towards the mind’s source, that is contemplating the mind’. Although I also follow Demiéville’s argumentation in my discussion, I do not agree with his interpretation of zhao in this context and prefer that of Gómez, whose reading of the teachings of Heshang Moheyan takes account of a number of texts attributed to him and on this basis argues for the translation ‘to turn the light’ for fanzhao. 40 The passage quoted is found in the Jingang sanmei jing xu pin di yi ␔⡰ፃ▓䔂ᢕ(17)㘙ጣ (Vajrasam\u0002dhis\u0003tra with preface, chapter one), T vol. 9, no. 273, 367a.14."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"248 CARMEN MEINERT out to sentient beings the path of seeing the original nature and becoming a Buddha. This Dharma is also called ‘return to the source’ (fanyuan), ‘return to luminosity’ (fanzhao), [...] ‘not originated’ (wusheng), ‘not defiled’ (wulou) and ‘not arising’ (wuqi) [...].41 If we now look again at the Small Treatise, the Tibetan rendering ‘reversing mind’s six faculties so as not to engage in deluded objects’ clearly does not have the same implications as the Chinese term fanzhao xinyuan in Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na’s teachings. Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na is directly pointing to the nature of mind, whereas in the Tibetan text, the Small Treatise, an antidote to counteract straying into any of the sensory objects of mind is given. At this point, we can only speculate as to why this particular Chinese term was translated as such. Perhaps the Tibetan translators were not familiar with the Chinese original texts of Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na, or maybe they had in mind the previously cited passage of the apoc-ryphal \u0004\u0003ra\u0002gamas\u0003tra which speaks about all six faculties being liberated instantly by the liberation of only one faculty. (2) The fruit of the meditation process, which is in the Small Treatise described as ‘bringing about complete nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder of the aggregates’ (phung po lhag ma ma lus par yongs su mya ngan las bzla ba), is a rather unusual expression in Tibetan Chan manuscripts. Tracing it back to the original Chinese equivalent might shed new light on the meaning of this term in the Small Treatise. For the Tibetan expression phung po lhag ma med pa’i mya ngan las ’das pa ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder of the aggregates’ the dictionary Mah\u0002vyutpatti gives the Chinese translation wuyu yi nieban (饳ጥ᎓遉肇).42 The use of this term is confirmed in the important eighth-century Chinese Dunhuang manuscript Dacheng ershier wenben ፥⠦ጰፀጰ㌰ᕩ (Twenty-two Questions on Mah\u0002-   41 T vol. 85, 1196c.14-19: ␔⡰ፃ▓䔂᎕\r⍤ᑈᎈ㌑₀ᐒ⌆扷\rᜤ፥⠦䙷㑴⌈␖\r♗ጣᐘ\u001cᖇᕩ⁤᝘᜘ខ−\rፙ䔂䒄卥፥፱⠦㑴ᑔᚇ‘䦗\r ᔳ╶\u001cᖇᕩ⁤−‖ᜇខ䘤\rᜤ⌈ᘓᙠᐲ䎗\rᘓᙠᐲ䐙\r[...]ᘓᙠ䀄ᖇ\rᘓᙠ䀄䠷\rᘓᙠ䀄(労)\r [...] 42 Honyaku my\u0004gi daish\u0003 /0┩2㠵3 (Mah\u0002vyutpatti), entry 1727 (3).

Such a relation may be presumed because Tankuang’s work was composed on behalf of the Tibetan King, Khri Srong lde btsan, as the analysis of W. Pachow has shown (PACHOW 1979a: 42-43). Before Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na was invited to take part in the Debate in order to defend the principles of the Sudden Enlightenment School, the Tibetan king had inquired about the Chinese standpoint. The many correspondences of this text with the Ratification of the True Principle have already been demonstrated elsewhere (PACHOW 1979a: 44-45; DEMIÉVILLE 1970: 34-35). In the preface Tankuang addresses his ‘Majesty’ (sheng 䔕) as follows: However, the principles involved in the questions are extremely profound and secret. [...] Regarding the questions of which I have comprehension, I shall explain them on the basis of concrete information, and regarding those which are new to me, I shall clarify them through general principles. I fear only that it may not meet with Your Majesty’s expectation, or that it may be a distortion of the original meaning.44 In the Twenty-two Questions on Mah\u0002y\u0002na the expression in question, ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder’, appears in a fourfold description of nirv\u0002\u0003a, as it is taught by Tankuang in accordance with the doctrines of the Chinese ‘Mind-Only school’ (weishi pai ⠙6襸). The third one in this list is indeed named ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder’ (wuyu yi nieban)45 and as such is mentioned by Tan-   43 Dacheng ershier wenben 㠵ၨᄠ⌥ᄠ (Twenty-two Questions on Mah\u0002y\u0002na), by Tankuang 猣獈, S. chin. 2674; reedited in T vol. 85, no. 2818, 1184a-1192c.

As they are all based on ‘suchness’ (zhenru '㤦) these four types of nirv\u0002\u0003a are not different from one another; however, in terms of their being freed from obstacles, the four are established to be distinct.47 In the Sudden Teachings, ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder’ is explained as follows: A bodhisattva is in a position to comprehend that everything is empty, and every dharma arises from mind. If the mind is not agitated, everything is in a state of suchness; [the bodhisattva] is [therefore] able to give up a conceptualizing and grasping mind. The discriminating mind will not arise if the true characteristics are understood. This is the wonderful principle of pure nirv\u0002\u0003a. Even though this principle [appears to] have been realized, however, there is nothing to realize; because one realizes nothing, one realizes everything. As one realizes nothing, one is freed from all obstacles of suffering. This is ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder’.48 Tankuang further elaborates on the differences between ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder’ and the other three types of nirv\u0002\u0003a. If one is striving for attainment and accomplishing merits, this is called ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a with remainder’ (youyu yi nieban); if sa\u0002s\u0002ra and nirv\u0002\u0003a do not abide anywhere, one attains to ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without an abode’; finally, because nothing is to be attained and therefore self-nature is not defiled, it is called ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a of the purity of self-nature’.49     す䠣), (2) ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a with remainder’ (youyu yi nieban ᜘យ′′′′す䠣), (3) ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder’ (wuyu yi nieban 䀄យ′′′′す䠣) and (4) ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without an abode’ (wuzhu chu nieban 䀄᝶㚀す䠣). 46 These are: question five (PACHOW 1979b: 43-45, 88; T vol. 85, 1185a.19-b.20); question seventeen (PACHOW 1979b: 59-61, 93; T vol. 85, 1188b.4-c.3); and question nineteen (PACHOW 1979b: 65-66, 95; T vol. 85, 1189b.21-1190a.12). 47 Dacheng ershier wenben, T vol. 85, 1185b.18-19: \u0002᠙ᕀすᆄ⚑′′′′©ᘅ\r㡉₁ᎈᙓ唥\r₁©ᚅ昹䀄⥅᠉▆\r\u0002PACHOW 1979b: 45, 88.\u0002 48 I generally follow the translation of PACHOW (1979b: 61), with some emend-ations.

If we return again to the Tibetan Chan manuscript Small Treatise two points can be made about the results of Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na’s practice of ‘gazing at mind’. First, it is a teaching that leads to the realization of a bodhisattva. As it is described in the Ratification of the True Principle it is ‘a practice that is no practice’.51 Through being completely freed from all conceptualizing, the luminosity of mind free from discrimination is realized.52 Second, however, the Small Treatise also states that sa\u0002s\u0002ra is nirv\u0002\u0003a and that one is ‘not abiding anywhere’ (ci la yang myi gnas). Is this statement not just the same as that which Tankuang had described as ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without an abode’, namely, the supreme nirv\u0002\u0003a of a Buddha? It may be, but it is apparent that the teachings presented in the Small Treatise are not very clear-cut as to the kind of attainment to which they ultimately lead. Finally, to attain a ‘nonconceptual’ state (rnam par mi rtog pa) is the object of any Mah\u0002y\u0002na Buddhist path. The Philosophical Treatment of ‘Gazing at Mind’ (kanxin) Having outlined the contents and some terminological problems of the Small Treatise, let us consider the central meditation instruction of ‘gazing at mind’ in more detail. J. Broughton has already pointed out a connection between Dunhuang Chan Buddhism and the Baotang School of Sichuan.53 As the Small Treatise itself asserts, the meditation practice described there was transmitted from K\u0002\u0002yapa to Bodhidharma. Two remarks found in the work Torch of Meditation also link the teachings of Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na to the teaching of Bodhidharma. First, it is said that the precepts transmitted to K\u0002\u0002yapa were passed down in a sevenfold lineage through   50 Dacheng ershier wenben, T vol. 85, 1185b.16-18: ᕀす䠣ᎉጣᐘ\u001cᖇ⚑᜘␃ጣ\rጰ⠦䀄唆⤰᜘⑙ፃ\r㌲ᤔᒀ㡇ᔡ‘ᕀ₀\r PACHOW 1979b: 44, 88. 51 ZLJ: f. 131 bis.b: [...]▔▆ᙠᝩጣᐘᝩ␦ᝩ.

Moreover, it will shed new light on the meditation method ‘gazing at mind’, which is to be seen as a further development of Bodhidharma’s teaching of ‘quieting the   54 SM: 15.1-3: de la rgyu’i theg pa bcom ldan ’das sku mya ngan las ’da’ kar ’od sgrungs la gdams ngag phog de dar m\u0004 dh\u0002 ra la sogs pa nas/ rgya nag por bdun rgyud tha ma ha shang ma h\u0002 yan la thug. SM: 24.5-6: /des brgyud pa’i tha ma ha shang ma h\u0002 yan gyi gzhung cig car ’jug pa [...]. The same information is given in the Bka’ thang sde lnga (Five Chronicles), f. 19a, revealed by O rgyan gling pa (1323-?): dpe don mang po ’od srungs nyid la gsungs/ de nas da mo tt\u0002 ra la sogs nas/ rgya nag sprul bdun brgyud pa brgyud pa’i tha/ Hwa shang ma h\u0002 y\u0002 na nyid la thug/ (cf. TUCCI 1958: 68). The great historian Ka\u0005 thog Tshe dbang nor bu (1698-1755) also discusses this sevenfold lineage and refers to the same quotation from the bKa’ thang sde lnga. See KA\u0006 THOG 1976-7 [1744]: 7b.2-6: /rgya nag bdun brgyud zhes bsgrang ba’i rgya nag bdun brgyud ni tsung men du grags pa ’di yi sde tshan kho nar nges la/ de yan slob dpon dha rmo tta ra ma bsgrang ba Hwa shang hu’i kho nas ma h\u0002 ya na’i bar [snying po] don brgyud gyi bla rabs bdun byung ba la sprul pa bdun brgyud du rnam par bzhag gam sems shing/ lo pa\u0003 bka’i thang yig las [...] /dpe don mang po ’od srung nyid la gsung/ de nas dha rmo tta ra la sogs nas/ rgya nag sprul bdun brgyud par brgyud pa’i tha/ Hwa shang ma ha ya na nyid la thug/. This sevenfold lineage of Chan Buddhism ending with Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na has to be seen as a regional phenomenon restricted to the Dunhuang area. The later standard Chinese historiography only acknowledged a six-fold lineage from Bodhidharma to Huineng. Thus, for instance, the Lengjia shizi ji 䍹ᔇ⥇䖙(三) (Record of the Masters and Disciples of the La\u0006k\u0002vat\u0002ra school [LJSZJ]), composedin 716 or 720 by Jingjue 㕕搦, T vol. 85, no. 2837, 1284c-1290c; yet it lists Shenxiu as the sixth patriarch. A similar regionalism can be observed in the Baotang School in Sichuan. Here Wuzhu (䀄᝶, 714-774) claimed that he was the seventh patriarch of Chan Buddhism as well (cf. DEMIÉVILLE 1979: 3-4). 55 SM: 173.5: ma h\u0002 yan gyi bsam gtan rgya lung chen po las [...]. This passage must be understood as being ‘from the Great Treatise, a dhy\u0002na treatise [transmitted by] Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na’s meditation [is based]. It is not very likely that the author of the SM, Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes, erroneously attributed the Rgya lung chen po to Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na (according to the reading: ‘the meditation of Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na in the Rgya lung chen po’), because Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes quotes extensively from the text we find preserved in Dunhuang manuscript PT 116, where the Rgya lung chen po is clearly attributed to Bodhidharma.

Therefore, Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes must have been aware that Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na was not the author of the Rgya lung chen po, yet nonetheless regarding him as in the tradition of Bodhidharma."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"CHAN AND RDZOGS CHEN 253 mind’ (anxin). But before analyzing how the concept of ‘quieting the mind’ developed into that of ‘gazing at mind’, I will present a brief outline of its treatment in the Great Treatise itself.56 ‘Quieting the mind’ (anxin) in the Great Treatise Two of the quotations from the Great Treatise given in the Torch of Meditation are translations of the Chinese original found in the Erru sixing lun ጰጳᕀᝩ卥 (The Treatise on Two Entrances and Four Practices).57 The first of these, in the Chinese version, reads as follows: If one rejects the false and reverts to the real and in a coagulated state abides in wall-examining, then self and other, common man and sage, are identical; firmly abiding without shifting, in no way following after the written teachings—this is mysteriously tallying with principle. It is non-discriminative, quiescent, and inactive; we call it entrance by principle.58   56 This outline of Bodhidharma’s teachings is indebted to the recent research on this topic by J. BROUGHTON (1999). In tracing back the possible development of the teaching of ‘quieting the mind’ (anxin) to that of of ‘gazing at mind’ (kanxin), I would merely like to point out the continuity of this central theme in Chinese Chan Buddhism. However, I am also aware of the risk involved in interpreting similar terms from different contexts along the same lines. My argument seeks only to demonstrate consistent usage with respect to similar topic, even though my research may fail to consider sufficiently the details of variance as well. 57 SM: 130.2-3, 173.5-176.5.

What are the four? The first is the practice of requiting injury; the second is the practice of following conditions; the third is the practice of having nothing to be sought; and the fourth is the practice of according with Dharma.59 Thus the central theme in the Erru sixing lun is an exposition of how to enter the ‘True Nature’ (zhenxing '嘧, yang dag pa’i ngo bo nyid), as it is named in Chinese Chan terminology.60 It is described as ‘non-discriminative’ (wu fenbie, rnam par rtog pa myed pa) and ‘quiescent’ (jingran, zhi) and is to be entered via ‘principle’ (li, don) or ‘practice’ (xingru, spyod pa la ’jug pa).

He stated, that ‘thus quieting mind is “wall-examining”’.61 This inter-pretation of Bodhidharma’s teachings by Daoxuan is noteworthy because it does not refer to ‘wall-examining’ as a mere physical posture and practice, that is sitting cross-legged in front of a wall. Rather, Daoxuan interprets it as an immediate recognition of ‘True Nature’ itself, as we shall see further below. The Tibetan interpretation of ‘wall-examining’ supports Daoxuan’s interpretation yet goes one step further. In the Torch of Meditation the Chinese term zhu biguan ‘abiding in wall-examining’ is rendered into Tibetan as lham mer gnas ‘abiding in luminosity’.62 The term lham me is synonymous with lhan ne and lhang nge meaning ‘clear, vivid and vividly resplendent’.63 The Tibetan rendering lham me for Chinese biguan is to be understood in this way. In the Torch of Meditation this very same sense of the luminosity (lham me) of mind is confirmed on a different occasion where a summary of the Rdzogs chen teachings is given. Here the term lhan ne lhang nge is used instead of lham me. The passage reads as follows: In the spontaneously perfected suchness of the supreme yoga, of Atiyoga, all dharma-s primordially self-radiate in the perfect and pure sphere of self-arising primordial gnosis. They are not separately sought as cause and fruition because they are spontaneously perfected. The Great Adept [lit. Great Soul] [realizes that] not [so much as] a moving particle can be named. What is there [then] to be meditated on in the clear and radiant (lhan ne lhang nge) primordial luminosity, which is intrinsic awareness, not to be expressed, unmovable, undefiled and not abiding.

According to the above-mentioned interpretation of Daoxuan, Bodhidharma’s ‘wall-examining’ has to be understood in a similar way: that it is through ‘wall-examining’ that the luminosity of mind is to be discovered. ‘Wall-examining’ equals ‘quieting the mind’. Therefore, we shall have to take a closer look at the meaning of ‘quieting the mind’ (anxin) in Bodhidharma’s teachings. From Bodhidharma’s ‘quieting the mind’ (anxin) to ‘gazing at mind’ (kanxin) in the Small Treatise In the tenth-century collection Zongjing lu III挤圗 (Record of the Mirror of the Thesis), the author Yongming Yanshou (ᕷ≠↑䜸, 903/4-976) proclaimed the essence of the One-Mind thesis. In the ninety-seventh chapter, the teachings of Bodhidharmat\u0002ra65are summed up in a quotation of one of his works named Anxin famen ᚒᑈ⌈␖ (Dharma Gate for Quieting Mind).

It clearly shows that in the teachings of Bodhi-dharma it was not merely understood as a practical meditation instruction, but as the realization of the absolute itself. ‘Quieting the mind’ is pointing directly to the nature of mind, which is beyond any limits of discrimination. This boundlessness of mind, of the absolute, is in Chan terminology expressed in the paradoxical phrase ‘mind is no-mind’. In a different work attributed to Bodhidharma this phrase is elucidated as follows: Because mind is no-mind, it is called Dharma mind. Today’s practitioners understand this as the destruction of all delusions. Mind is like space, indestructible, and therefore it is called the adamantine mind. Mind does not abide in abiding, nor does it abide in non-abiding, and therefore it is called the mind of prajñ\u0002. The mind nature is broad and great. Its operation is directionless. Therefore, we call it the Mah\u0002y\u0002na mind. The mind substance is penetrating, without obstacles, unimpeded, and therefore it is called the bodhi mind. Mind has no bounds. It is not localized. Because mind is without characteristics, it does not have limits. As it operates without defect, it is not unlimited. It does not have bounds nor is it unbounded, and therefore it is called the mind of the Reality Bound.69 As we can see from these passages, the absolute is not merely defined by the aspect of emptiness, but also by the aspect of knowing,70 as is evident in the description here of no-mind as the ‘mind of prajñ\u0002’. Indeed mind, according to Bodhidharma, is in its many facets co-emergent insomuch as it is empty and knowing, a   69 S. chin. 2715 in Dunhuang chanzong wenxian jicheng, 1998, vol. shang, 402.2-6: ᑈ䀄ᑈ▆ᙠ⌈ᑈ\rᐆ⦖ᝩ⍱ᒈᜤㄑጣᐘ㡩\rᑈᚅ䄨⍤ᎈᔡㄑ戣▆ᙠ␔⡰ᑈ\rᑈᎈ᝶᝶ᎈ᝶ᎈ᝶ᙠ⌆❡ᑈ\rᑈ−兂፥䘢ᖈ䀄ᑗ▆ᙠ全䅕➀ᑈ\rᑈ昹䈐㜧䀄偓䀄偓扢▆ᙠ䄂㤀ᑈ\rᑈ䀄㎆もᘓ䀄ᑗᙙ\rᑈ䀄䌣▆␦᜘挠\rᖈᝐᎈB▆␦䀄挠␦᜘偔␦䀄偔ᙠ♗䝖偔ᑈ\rThis passage is ‘Record I’, paragraph 48, in Broughton’s reading of the Bodhidharma Anthology.

Indeed, in the Lengjia shizi ji (Record of the Masters and Disciples of the La\u0006k\u0002vat\u0002ra school), (hereafter called the Record of the La\u0006k\u0002vat\u0002ra school),72 which is a record of the early Chan tradition, the first entry, which concerns Gu\u0007abhadra (ᥕ‹䅶␘扷, 394-468), divides ‘quieting the mind’ (anxin) into four different stages. The stages are differentiated by the degree to which one is able to realize the mind that has insight into ‘true reality’ or the ‘principle’ (lixin \u000b唧).73 Therefore, it is apparent that the early Chan movement spoke mostly about the principle and very little about the practice of Chan itself. Even the famous scholar-monk Zongmi (䑙䔆, 780-841) noted this very same point in the Chanyuan zhuquan ji duxu \u0002錖AB3C则 (General Preface to the Collection of Explanations of the Chan Source), a preface to a work that was, in its day, the most comprehensive collection of Chan writings in the Tang dynasty (618-906).74 Despite Zongmi’s critique of the lack of meditation instructions in the scriptures of the early Chan movement, we do, in fact, find an actual meditation instruction in the writings of the fourth Chan   71 See the quotation of SM: 60.2-6, cited at n. 62 above. 72 The Dunhuang manuscript LJSZJ represents a somewhat different account of the early transmission of the Chan movement than do the later ones such as DAOXUAN’S Xu gaoseng zhuan (Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks), mentioned above.

Therefore, it is said in the Vimalak\u0007rti-s\u0003tra: ‘Suddenly you regain original mind’.85 This teaching by the fourth patriarch, Daoxin, of ‘gazing at mind’ is the connecting thread between Bodhidharma’s ‘quieting the mind’ and ‘gazing at mind’ as it is described in our Dunhuang manuscript, the Small Treatise. On the one hand, it is obvious that Daoxin is indebted to Bodhidharma’s concept of ‘quieting the mind’, which points to the luminosity of mind itself. Yet, on the other hand, he further develops Bodhidharma’s ‘principle’ (li) into the ‘expedient means’ (fangbian) of ‘gazing at mind’. This very same meditation instruction, which later, in the Dunhuang materials, came to be renowned as Hwa shang Mah\u0002y\u0002na’s method, is also expressed in the Small Treatise, which we know is an instruction pointing out the nature of mind. Therefore, the Small Treatise may be seen as a continuation of a traditional theme in the early Chan movement in Central China, a movement that also flourished in the Sino-Tibetan border area. This development may be regarded as an extension in terms of the affinity of the essential teachings; although the direct lineage of transmission from master to disciple is not considered in   83 LJSZJ: T vol. 85, 1289a.18: 奵䀅妕㐑ᕩ−\r' 84 LJSZJ: T vol. 85, 1289a.20-21: ␃唆⍱⑙ᑗ␳ፒ\r 85 LJSZJ: T vol. 85, 1289a.13-18: ᑈᙰ≠㕕\r暈䝠ᐗ≠\rᐑᕂ⍤㕕\r᠙ᑈ−㍳䐀\rᚅ₁㍳䐀\r③䔕ᑈ昳ᦘ\r[...]┷晧ᎈ䢙\r㎖ᚈ᠙䀅\r▔ᙠខ−\r‖ខ−⍱\rᕷ憂ᖇᜥ\rᙠᔄᒀጱ\r▔▆䤰全䔂᎕\r奵䀅妕㐑ᕩ−\r'By and large, I follow CHAPPELL 1983: 119, but have made some emendations."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"262 CARMEN MEINERT the present chapter, it is treated elsewhere.86 Let us now turn to the Tibetan commentary PT 699 to see how it fits into the broader picture of Sino-Tibetan Buddhism and how this Chan instruction on the nature of mind was interpreted by Tibetans in the Sino-Tibetan border area. THE TIBETAN COMMENTARY PT 699 Text History The Tibetan commentary PT 699 to the Small Treatise covers five folios. I will refer to it as the Commentary hereafter. Like the Small Treatise, it is a palm-leaf-style manuscript, but is not as neatly drafted. It is written in the ’bru ma script, i.e., a mixture of dbu can and dbu med.87 The comments are arranged in a rather peculiar way and decrease drastically in length towards the end. For example, the commentary to the first passage of the Small Treatise covers more than one folio, that is, nine lines,88 whereas the concluding phrase of the Small Treatise is elucidated by just a single expression.89 From folio 1a.1 to folio 4a.3 the comments are written following immediately the quotation of the original text. They are also written in the same size as the cited root text. However, at folio 4a.4 the format of the explanatory comments changes suddenly to interlinear annotations written in letters half the size of the root text though in the same hand. We hardly know anything about the circumstances under which a text such as the Commentary might have been drafted. A comparison with the Small Treatise suggests, however, that the Small Treatise was probably copied earlier under different circumstances by a scribe, whereas the Commentary PT 699, as a   86 RAO 1964: 173-76. 87 S. Karmay identified the script of other similar Tibetan Dunhuang manuscripts as ’bru ma. Refer to KARMAY 1988: 59; also KARMAY 1985: 280. 88 The first phrase mtha’ yas pa’i sems can thams cad ‘limitless sentient beings’, despite its relative unimportance for the document as a whole, is explained in great detail with regard to the six classes of beings and the innumerable beings without form (PT 699: f. 1a.1-1b.2). 89 The very important closing line of the Lung chung—rnam par myi rtog sa le ba/ /sa le ba la rtogs pa myed/ /di ni rang rig ye shes ste/ /’di zhes gdags su myed pa’o/ / (‘Nonconceptualization is vividly clear, and [even this] lucidness is not conceptualized.

We may consider these points in turn. (1) Based on his codicological work, involving criteria such as types of paper, writing instruments, spacing of columns, and handwriting styles, the Japanese scholar Ueyama Daishun arranged about 140 of the most important Chan manuscripts from Dunhuang into three chronological strata.91 The first period dates to 750-780, when Chinese culture still exerted a strong influence on the remote Central Asian oasis. The second period, from the 780s to circa 860, roughly correlates with the period of Tibetan dominion over Dunhuang, which left a strong Tibetan cultural impact. Finally, the third period, continuing into the 900s, is associated with the restoration of Chinese power over the Dunhuang area through the regime of the Guiyi jun 恶䔒➒ (‘Return to Righteousness Army’), though this third period did not result in a complete reestablishment of cultural identity with Central China. In accord with this scheme of three periods, Ueyama proposed that in the first period high-quality Chinese paper was used, whereas in the second period coarse paper and palm-leaf style manuscripts appeared. As a result of the Tibetan dominion over Dunhuang, when Dunhuang was cut off from China proper, Chinese writing brushes were eventually replaced by local products such as wooden pens introduced by the Tibetans. Ueyama further remarked that in the third period coarse paper and writing utensils brought by the Tibetans continued to be in use. The manuscripts of that period are often characterized, moreover, by unskilled calligraphy.92 With regard to this general information, these points can be made about the Commentary. Judging from the palm-leaf style paper, it   90 The first few lines of folio 4b give the impression that the root text was copied first and the interlinear notes added later. However, line nine of folio 4b shows that this was not the case throughout.

Moreover, even though it is unclear how much later than the Small Treatise the Commentary was composed, we might tentatively date it to the second half of the ninth century, when knowledge about Chinese Chan Buddhism, though probably still rather fresh, had already begun to be combined with elements from other traditions as well. It was a time when neither the Tibetans nor the Chinese exercised complete control over the Dunhuang area. The assumption of the late ninth century as the date of composition of the text is also supported by the following argument. (2) If we look at names and other works mentioned in the Commentary (PT 699) we are brought to the time around the reign of king Khri Srong lde bstan (755-c. 800). An enumeration of names includes Gnubs Nam ka’i snying po, Rlang Su ga ta go ba, Lang ’gro Dkon cog ’byung nas, Dbu na A nang,93 ’Brom Za Sril pa and Mar Kong za Rin cen.94 Even though not all names can be identified clearly, at least two of them are renowned, in later traditional sources, among the twenty-five disciples of Padmasambhava, namely Gnubs Nam ka’i snying po and Lang ’gro Dkon cog ’byung nas.95 According to these late sources, Gnubs Nam ka’i snying po is said to have received initiation from Padmasambhava in the late eighth century and thereafter travelled to India to study the doctrines of \br\u0003 Heruka (yang dag he ru ka) under H\u0003\tkara.96 After he had returned to Tibet he collaborated on many translation projects together with the great late eighth-century Rdzogs chen masters Vimalamitra and Vairocana.97 Nam ka’i snying po is believed to have later concealed many ‘treasures’ (gter ma).98   93 He is perhaps to be identified with ’Bu na A na mentioned in PT 44 as a Vajrak\u0004la adept. See KAPSTEIN 2000: 158. 94 PT 699: f. 2a.7-b.1.

As a sign of this, he is reputed to have been able to hurl mighty thunderbolts like arrows in the sky (DUDJOM RINPOCHE 1991: vol. 1, 536). 100 Lang ’gro Dkon cog ’byung nas is quoted twice in the Cig car ba chapter of SM: 150.6-151.6 and 169.1-170.1.

Therefore, this second line of argument also suggests that the Commentary might have been composed in the second half of the ninth century.

It lists in great detail various matters such as the six realms of sentient beings (f. 1a.1-5), the eight kinds of suffering (f. 1b.4-6), the four streams from which suffering originates (f. 1b.6-7), and the meaning of the net of ignorance (f. 1b.7-2a.6).

The main body of the Commentary is a lengthy exposition of how to settle the mind in meditation,107 a meditation interpreted as a practice of ‘nonconceptuality’ (myi rtog par bsgom), which is to be attained by first observing instructions on the bodily posture: Letting one’s vision drop [to the floor] in front of the tip of the nose, the objects of sight are cut off. Pressing the tongue against the palate, concepts are cut off. Placing the right hand into the left, [the duality] of grasper and grasped is cut off. Crossing the right leg over the left, the coming and going of perceived objects is cut off. In brief, [this is] how to meditate on nonconceptuality.108 This meditation is further described as a gradual process. When one is not distracted by the objects of the mind’s six faculties, one is ‘gazing at mind’, which is here understood as a ‘method’ (thabs) to utterly deconstruct the eight aspects of existence and non-existence of mind.109 ‘Gazing at mind’ is seen as a step-by-step analysis of mind based on ‘reasoning’ (gtan tshigs) and ‘discriminative awareness’ (shes rab). Finally, mind’s ‘ultimate principle’ (don), which one has comprehended, is ‘intrinsic awareness’ (rang rig) that is beyond any designation.110 Therefore, the gradual approach is completed by a sudden realization of intrinsic awareness. Further-more, the process of ‘non-mentation’ (yid la myi byed pa) and ‘non-conceptualization’ (myi rtog pa) is explained in terms of ‘three precepts’ (lung gsum),111 ‘three quintessential instructions’ (man   107 PT 699: f. 3b.7: Sems gzhag pa’i thabs bstan pa. 108 PT 699: f. 2b.3-4: dmyig sna gong du dbab/ pa ni lta ba’i yul bcad pa yin la/ lce rkan la gnan pa ni/ smra bsam gi yul bcad pa yin la/ lag pa g.yas kyi g.yon bnan pa ni gzung ’dzin gi yul bcad/ rkang pa g.yas kyis g.yon bnan ba ni/ ’ongs gro gnyis kyi yul bcad pa yin no/ spyir bsus (= bsdus) na rnam par myi rtog par bsgom mo/. 109 PT 699: f. 3a.2: rang gi sems la bltas na ni/ thabs yin la/ de tsam la myi gnas pa ni/ sems yod myed rnam pa brgyad do/ sems rnam pa brgyad kyis gtan tshigs kyis gtan la phab la/.

The concluding remarks of the Commentary on the meditation instructions discuss the fruition of this practice. Mind is permanently to be tamed in order to disclose that it is without any reality; how-ever, it is to be internalized as nonconceptuality.114 As dharmat\u0002 is unmistakably realized by means of discriminative awareness, suffering and enlightenment do not exist apart from one other.115 The subsequent explanations of the understanding of emptiness do not provide any further information, but merely paraphrase the root text. However, the interpretation of the following passage—that having gradually cleansed all karmic habitual tendencies, [thoughts] are ‘self-liberated’ (rang grol)—is of utmost interest. The Comment-ary says: When the antidote to the \u0005r\u0002vaka’s [one-sided] quiescence [which is detrimental to the realization of Buddhahood] is internalized, even the movement [of mind] is equipoised simply in [the syllable] A.

These ‘three quintessential instructions’ together with the following ‘three seeds’ appear as the main instructions of Chan master Wuzhu (饳ጕ714-774) of the Sichuanese Baotang school (ᑗ➈) in the important Dunhuang Chan scroll, Dunhuang PT 116: part IVb, f. 165.4-166.1.

A terminological analysis of certain expressions in the Small Treatise reveals that the meditation method of ‘gazing at mind’ is meant to be a direct recognition of the nature of mind, which leads to the highest realization of a bodhisattva or even to that of a Buddha. The Commentary, however, frequently applies a terminology that differs somewhat from that of the Chinese Chan tradition and there-fore provides a novel interpretation. Five examples will be consid-ered in turn. (1) As noted above, the expression ‘reversing mind’s six faculties so as not to engage in deluded objects’ (sems kyi sgo drug ’khrul pa’i yul la myi ’jug par bzlog) is a rendering of the Chinese phrase ‘turning the luminosity [of the mind] towards the mind’s source’ (fanzhao xinyuan), and is thus understood as a definition for the meditation method called ‘gazing at mind’ (sems la bltas, kanxin). Moreover, it is meant to be an immediate return to the minds’ source itself. However, the commentator only indirectly connects this expression to the meditation method of ‘gazing at mind’, but instead to regard it still as a preliminary practice similar to that of taking the right bodily position. Just as sitting upright brings the body into the   122 PT 699: f. 5a.1-3: ’od srungs che la chos gtad pa/ rgya gar gi mkhan po nyi shu rtsa brgyad khungs brgyud pa’i mtha’ ma dar ma ta la gtad do/.

It functions as an antidote for any sensory distractions of mind. The author then provides a literal explanation of the phrase ‘reversing mind’s six faculties from not engaging in deluded objects’ and clarifies how each faculty goes astray. 123 Summing up, if the practitioner continues to be engaged in delud-ed objects that distract the mind, then he is also not reverting from the path of reflection and analysis (rtog dpyod lam). The process of further leads to a complete deconstruction of any concept of the existence or non-existence of mind. Thus, beginning with the analysis of the six sense objects, the Commentary provides a step-by-step explanation of how the ultimate goal of the meditation process is to be obtained. Nevertheless, the commentator acknowledges, in accord with the Small Treatise, that finally the meaning of a complete recognition of the ultimate principle, and therefore an ‘instantaneous’ (skad cig la) attainment of Buddhahood, is ‘intrinsic awareness’ (rang rig).124 (2) In the Small Treatise, the ultimate attainment is described as ‘bringing about complete nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder of the aggreg-ates’ (phung po lhag ma ma lus par yongs su mya ngan las bzla ba). According to Chinese sources it is understood as the realization of suchness and therefore as a state of mind freed from any discrimination.125 The Commentary is, at least in part, very close to this interpretation. It says: If no more dichotomous habitual tendencies remain in the conscious-ness, it is called ‘[nirv\u0002\u0003a] without remainder of the aggregates’.126 However, we must also consider the aforementioned list of accomplished ones, who are given as examples of having attained such a realization. This enumeration includes Gnubs Nam ka’i snying po and Lang ’gro Dkon cog ’byung nas.127 In referring to   123 One example (from PT 699: f. 2b.6) reads as follows: ‘The nose goes astray if it follows smell.

In his comprehensive study of the early Rdzogs chen movement, S. Karmay first brought attention to a passage in the Torch of Meditation discussing nirv\u0002\u0003a with and without remainder.128 There, in the chapter on Mah\u0002yoga, it is said that if the defilements of the aggregates are exhausted, one becomes a vidy\u0002dhara ‘with bodily remainder’.129 There follows a quotation from the Questions and Answers of Vajrasattva (Rdo rje sems pa’i zhus lan), a text that we have seen cited elsewhere in the Commentary.130 It reads as follows: What is the meaning of accomplishing Buddhahood within one lifetime? It means that with a body having remainder [of the aggregates] one may realize the accomplishment of a vidy\u0002dh\u0002ra, who has the power over life. And through just this life as a vidy\u0002dhara [one] may become the unsurpassed [Buddha] Samantabhadra.131 Then the Torch of Meditation lists, as does our Commentary, the names of masters who accomplished this goal. Among them we also find Gnubs Nam ka’i snying po, who is said to have passed away escorted by \t\u0002kin\u0007.132 If we return to the Commentary, two points can be made in terms of the Tibetan interpretation of the phrase ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder of the aggregates’ in general and about Gnubs Nam ka’i snying po in particular. First, in its Tibetan usage we can see an extension of the Chinese concept, which did not take the expression in its literal sense, but in the philosophical sense of attaining the state of a bodhisattva or even that of a Buddha.133 Second, the comparison   128 KARMAY 1988: 191-92. 129 SM: 277.1: phung po’i zag pa yang zad nas/ da ltar gyi rnam par smin pa lhag ma’i lus ’dis tshe la dbang ba’i rig ’dzin ’grub/. 130 See above, nn. 101 and 117. 131 SM: 277.2-3: sangs rgyas tshe gcig gis ’grub pa’i don ji lta bu lags/ /lhag mar bcas pa’i lus nyid kyis/ /tshe la dbang pa’i rig ’dzin ’grub/ /rig pa ’dzin pa’i tshe nyid kyis/ /bla med kun tu bzang por ’gyur/.

Gnubs Nam ka’i snying po is presented as an example of one who accomplished the state of Samantabhadra, the supreme \u000bdi-Buddha of the Rdzogs chen teachings, the realization of the dharmak\u0002ya itself. In the description proffered by the Torch of Meditation, a progression may be observed from exhausting the defilements of the aggregates, through becoming a vidy\u0002dh\u0002ra ‘with remainder of the aggregates’, and finally to becoming Samanta-bhadra himself, who is beyond any designation and remainder of the aggregates. In this sense, the expression ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder of the aggregates’ might be taken in its literal meaning. This is exemplified by Gnubs Nam ka’i snying po, who abandoned common bondage to the coarse bodily form and passed away escorted by \t\u0002kin\u0007s. However, there is no textual evidence that his accomp-lishment might be taken as a ‘rainbow body’ (’ja’ lus), literally understood as designating the complete disintegration of the body and at the same time the supreme realization within the Rdzogs chen teachings.134 (3) The Commentary explains that all the habitual tendencies of karma are purified through the ‘adamantine sam\u0002dhi’ (rdo rje lta bu’i ting nge ’dzin), which is defined as the co-emergence of serenity and insight.135 The term ‘adamantine sam\u0002dhi’ is used in the causal philosophical vehicles (rgyu mtshan nyid theg pa) to describe the final removal of ‘cognitive obscurations’ (shes bya’i sgrib pa) before attaining the eleventh bh\u0003mi of a Buddha.136 Here, the metaphor of a diamond as an ‘indestructible material’ (rdzas kyi rdo rje) symbol-izes the ‘indestructibility of primordial wisdom’ (ye shes kyi rdo rje), which is to be realized in sam\u0002dhi.137 In the eighth-century Tibetan translation by Ska ba Dpal brtsegs of the Mah\u0002y\u0002nas\u0003tr\u0002la\u0002k\u0002rak\u0002rik\u0002 (Verse Ornament of the Mah\u0002-y\u0002na Stras), usually attributed to Maitreya, the realization of the   134 On the ‘rainbow body’, see now KAPSTEIN 2004. 135 PT 699: f. 4b.2-3: zhi nas lhag mthong cha snyoms pa las rdo rje lta bu ting nge ’dzin. 136 ‘Emotional obscurations’ (nyon mongs pa’i sgrib pa) are purified on attaining the first bh\u0003mi of ‘great joy’ (rab tu dga’ ba). In progressing from the second to the tenth bh\u0003mi, the ‘cognitive obscuration’ is cleansed. The tenth bh\u0003mi is threefold, and the complete purification of the third part of the tenth bh\u0003mi is accomplished by means of the ‘adamantine sam\u0002dhi’. Then all obscurations are purified and the eleventh bh\u0003mi of a Buddha is obtained. 137 Furthermore, the vajra as a ritual object carries the same meaning: the five-pronged vajra symbolizes the union of the ‘five wisdoms’ (ye shes lnga)."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"274 CARMEN MEINERT adamantine sam\u0002dhi is described in terms of the five paths to enlightenment: If [the fourth path] of meditation is completed, one attains to the final [path] of meditation.138 Then the bodhisattva, who is empowered [in the highest stage], obtains the adamantine sam\u0002dhi, which is not to be destroyed by discursive thoughts.139 The commentary of ’Ju Mi pham Rin po che (1846-1912) on this passage elaborates further the meaning of the expression ‘adamant-ine sam\u0002dhi’ in relation to the path of no-more-learning: Then the bodhisattva attains to abiding on the final tenth bh\u0003mi.

This explanation entirely accords with that of ‘nirv\u0002\u0003a without remainder of the aggregates’ discussed above. Moreover, this passage directly leads us to what Mi pham Rin po che calls the ‘eleventh bh\u0003mi of no-more-learning’ (sa bcu gcig pa mi slob pa’i sa). The Commentary, however, uses the expression the bh\u0003mi of ‘all-encompassing light’ (kun du ’od), to the meaning of which we now turn. (4) The locution ‘bh\u0003mi of the Buddha, [that of] all-encompassing light’ (sangs rgyas kyi sa kun du ’od) is a distinctive appellation for the attainment of the eleventh bhmi. In Mi pham Rin po che’s com-mentary on the Man ngag lta ba’i ’phreng ba (Quintessential Instruction [Called] the Garland of Views), an early Rdzogs chen text attributed to Padmasambhava, the term ‘all-encompassing light’ is traced back to its original source in the system of the causal philosophical vehicles. Mi pham Rin po che argues as follows: Spontaneously entering into the ‘bh\u0003mi of the great accumulation wheel of the [seed] syllables’, which is the fruition [of the Rdzogs chen teachings],141 is according to the general causal philosophical vehicles named the bh\u0003mi of a Buddha, that of ‘all-encompassing light’. By means of emanating a great amount of light, those who are to be tamed are made into a suitable vessel. This is the reason why [the attainment of this bh\u0003mi] is so-called. In the general vajray\u0002na it is renowned as the thir[teenth] bh\u0003mi of a Buddha.142 Here, ‘all-encompassing light’ means that the dharmak\u0002ya, which is without characteristics and naturally illuminating, is all-pervading.143   141 The original passage in PADMASAMBHAVA (attr.), Man ngag gi rgyal po lta ba’i ’phreng ba, in P 83, no. 4726, f. 418b.4 reads: de ltar tshul ’di ni rdzogs pa chen po’i mthar phyin pa’i don/ yi ge ’khor lo tshogs chen gyi sa la lhun gyis ’jug pa ste/. 142 Here, for the third bh\u0003mi read the thirteenth.

This last term yi ge ’khor lo (‘wheel of the seed syllables’) has to be understood as the ma\u0007\fala of the central seed syllable A, which is, in the Rdzogs chen teachings, a symbol of \u0005\u0003nyat\u0002 and the essence and origin of all.144 In the commentary of Klong chen rab ’byams pa (1308-1363) on the Guhyagarbhatantra (Rgyud gsang ba snying po), the seed syllable A is defined as follows: In the ’Jam dpal mtshan brjod (Mañju\u0005r\u0005n\bmasa\u0002g\u0005ti, the Litany of the Names of Mañju\u0005r\u0007), it is said: ‘A is the supreme letter.

The nature of A is the self-nature of mind, completely beyond all existents and non-existents’.145 Let us recall again the passage in question in our Dunhuang manuscript, the Commentary. Here it is said that the bh\u0003mi of ‘all-encompassing light’ is attained after the antidote to the \u0005r\u0002vaka’s one-sided quiescence is fully comprehended and one has accomplished the adamantine sam\u0002dhi. It is further said that all movement of mind is equipoised simply in A.146 We know that the author of the Commentary at least came into contact with early Rdzogs chen thought as it was transmitted, for instance, in the Dunhuang manuscript of the Questions and Answers of Vajrasattva.     theg pa spyi las sangs rgyas kyi sa kun tu ’od ces bya ste/ ’di ltar ’od zer mang po bkye bas ’dul ba’i ’gro ba snod du rung bar mdzad pa’i phyir de skad ces grags so/ /rdo rje theg pa spyi las ni sangs rgyas kyi sa gsum du grags te/ /de la kun tu ’od ni chos kyi sku mtshan ma med pa rang bzhin gyis ’od gsal bas kun la khyab pa’o/. 144 Geshe Pema Tsering (Dge bshes Padma tshe ring), in his oral explanation, confirms this interpretation of the seed syllable A in regard to the Rdzogs chen term yi ge ’khor lo. 145 KLONG CHEN RAB ’BYAMS PA, Gsang snying ’grel pa, f. 65a.3-4: mtshan brjod las/ a ni yig ’bru kun gyi mchog/ /khong nas ’byung ba skye ba med/ [...] mdo las/ rab ’byor yi ge ni don dam par ma skyes pa ste a’i ngo bo nyid do/ a’i ngo bo nyid gang yin pa de ni sems kyi rang bzhin te dngos po dang dngos po med pa thams cad las yang dag par ’das pa’o/. 146 PT 699: f. 4b.2: ’gyur ba yang a tsam du cha bnyam/.

Finally, the attainment of the ‘bh\u0003mi of all-encompassing light’, which is used here to mean the result, is also affirmed in a tantric text and not only in the s\u0003tras, as Mi pham Rin po che has stated. For instance, in Klong chen pa’s commentary on the Guhyagarbhatantra, it says: The fruition, the omniscient Buddha, abides on the eleventh bh\u0003mi of ‘all-encompassing light’ and effortlessly accomplishes the two aims [of oneself and others].148 (5) The Commentary concludes the last sentence of the root text, which confirms primordial gnosis of intrinsic awareness, with the pithy expression i ti yin no.149 The term i ti, which in its Sanskrit transcription is not very common in the later Bka’ ’gyur and Bstan ’gyur literature—it is usually represented instead by the Tibetan equivalent ces bya ba—is, however, found in early Rdzogs chen texts.

His understanding is in the first instance indebted to a Chinese conception of Buddhist immediacy, but he explains the method of ‘gazing at mind’, which was meant to be a direct recognition of the nature of mind in the Chinese context, more in terms of a gradual process of realization. Here, he relies on the ceaseless investigation of any movement in the mind and on the practice of ‘serenity and insight’ (zhi gnas dang lhag mthong). However, the author of the Commentary does not adhere solely to the supremacy of the gradual path, for he acknowledges an ‘intrinsic awareness’ (rang rig) whereby he returns to the teaching of immed-iacy once more: it is simply in understanding the intrinsic awareness of primordial gnosis that the supreme eleventh bh\u0003mi of a Buddha is accomplished. In this sense we might regard the Small Treatise as being interpreted here from the perspective of the omniscience of mind, an interpretation that is also confirmed by Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes in his Torch of Meditation. It is in the chapter on the exposition of the Chan standpoint that he refers to the Small Treatise in connection with Lang ’gro Dkon cog ’byung nas, who, as we have seen, is also mentioned in the Commentary as an accomplished one.156 In the Torch of Meditation, this same figure is quoted as stating that by virtue of ‘discriminative awareness’ (shes rab) one reaches to the ‘natural sphere’ (ngo bo nyid kyi dbyings nyid) beyond   154 Ibid.: vol. 5 (Mar pa bka’ brgyud skor), 69: thugs kyi nying khu/ i thi/. 155 PT 699: f. 5a.5.

Therefore, the question arises, what might have been the connecting thread that enabled the author of the Commentary to conjoin elements of Chan meditation with Rdzogs chen? I propose looking again at the final line of the Small Treatise which he sealed with the expression i ti yin no. It reads: Nonconceptuality is vividly clear, and [even this] lucidness is not conceptualized. This is the primordial gnosis of intrinsic awareness, which cannot be designated as ‘this’ [existing entity].160 ‘Nonconceptuality’ (rnam par mi rtog pa) is the essence of the Chan Buddhist teaching as it is presented both in the Small Treatise and by the author of the Commentary. It is an oft-repeated matter of discussion in other Chan manuscripts from Dunhuang as well. For instance, the most important Tibetan Chan scroll, PT 116, elaborates in great detail (part VIa, f. 146.2-163.3) the coincidence of non-conceptuality with twenty-three key concepts of Mah\u0002yana Buddh-ism. Nonconceptuality is the main theme running through additional Dunhuang manuscripts, too. For instance, we find among them three translations of the \u000bry\u0002vikalpaprave\u0005an\u0002madh\u0002ra\u0003\u0007, one in Chinese (Foshuo ru wu fenbie zongchi jing ខ䦗ጳ䀄ᐗ᠉夈╳䔂, jiang 奂 23) and two in Tibetan (’Phags pa rnam par mi rtog par ’jug pa’i gzungs, IOL Tib J 51 and 52).161   157 Lang ’gro Dkon cog ’byung nas is quoted in a passage discussing the ‘faults of conceptualizing’ (rtog skyon). Refer to SM: 169.1-170.1. 158 SM: 170.3-4: dang po nas thams cad mkhyen pa nyid la cig car zhugs pa ste/ de ni bslab pa med pa’i bslab pa zhes bya’o/. 159 SM: 170.2-3: lung chung nas gsungs pa ltar/ sems g.yung du ’gyur zhing sdug bsngal nyid byang chub la/ ’khor ba mya ngan las ’das par ’gyur ro/.

To whatever extent profound nonconceptuality appears as an object of the intellect, the experience of this profound nonconceptuality is an experience and not reality itself.162 Moreover, if we look again at the important testimony regarding Buddhist currents in ninth- and tenth-century Tibet, which we find in the Torch of Meditation, its author clearly emphasizes his aim as being ‘to comprehend thoroughly the expositions of noncon-ceptuality according to each vehicle’ ( i.e., Rim gyis pa, Cig car ba, Mah\u0002yoga and Atiyoga).163 Therefore, we might conclude that in the Dunhuang area a regional Buddhist current developed, far removed from the Buddhist mainstreams of both Central Tibet and Central China. This tradition did not identify itself so much in terms of a lineage transmitted from master to disciple within only one tradition; rather, it seems to have developed more around a particular theme, the topic of ‘non-conceptuality’ (rnam par mi rtog pa). One result is the syncretic tradition we have just reviewed. THE TIBETAN CRITIQUE OF THE SYNCRETIC TRADITION The Tibetan dominion over Dunhuang between roughly 786 and 848 triggered an exchange of different Buddhist currents that developed apart from mainstream Tibetan or Chinese Buddhism and incorporated ideas and terminology dervied from the Chan as well as the Rdzogs chen traditions. Our Commentary exemplifies this trend.     SHIU forthcoming.

The most comprehensive source for our knowledge of these developments is still the tenth-century Torch of Meditation by Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes. Though the author has only a moderate opinion of the Chinese Chan standpoint, acknowledging it to be an authentic Buddhist path and not a heresy, nevertheless, he does deem it inferior to the Rdzogs chen teachings.164 This type of gradation of the teachings may even remind us of Zongmi’s system of classification (panjiao ᠐㑴) of the various Chan schools in Tang-dynasty China, which he introduced in his General Preface to the Collection of Explanations of the Chan Source (Chanyuan zhuquan jidu xu) written in 833.165 I propose to regard our Dunhuang manuscript of the Commentary as an example of the syncretic teaching Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes might have had in mind when writing his Torch of Meditation. He himself states: On the occasion [of writing] the Torch of Meditation, I have explained in detail [the Cig car ba tradition], because it might mislead one as it is similar to the Rdzogs chen teachings.166 In fact, the targets of his critique were those who, in his view, understood clear neither the principles of Chan, nor those of Rdzogs chen. He argued that while some, perhaps even the author of the Commentary, claimed their own erroneous views to be the authentic Rdzogs chen doctrine, they were, in fact, mixing together elements of two distinct traditions. Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes went so far as to buttress his argument with a citation from one of the early texts of the Sems sde bco brgyad (Eighteen [Teachings] of the Ment-al Class), the Spyi bcings (General Outline [of the Rdzogs chen Doctrine]):   164 The different levels of the understanding of ‘nonconceptuality’ (mi rtog pa) in the four systems (Rim gyis pa, Cig car ba, Mah\u0002yoga and Rdzogs chen) are ranged like the rungs of a ladder. See SM: 60.6-61.1: de dag gi khyad par skad [= skas] kyi gdang bu bzhin te/ dper na skad [= skas] gdang la mtho dman yod par dang ’dra ste/ mi rtog pa ’di bzhi yang khyad par yod (ston tsen mah\u0002 a ti)/. 165 See above n. 74. 166 SM: 186.1-3: rnal ’byor mig gi bsam gtan gyi skabs ’dir/ ston mun dang rdzogs chen cha ’dra bas gol du dogs pa’i phyir rgyas par bkod do/."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"CHAN AND RDZOGS CHEN 283 [...] However, there are still those who do not understand the view [of Rdzogs chen]. They have neither confidence in the view nor a genuine transmission of the quintessential instructions. Merely being versed in the lower [teachings] they say: ‘By virtue of intrinsic awareness one does not realize the [true] nature of dharmat\u0002, wherein the empty unborn, called “thusness”, is not taken as an object. Hence, neither is it an object of primordial gnosis, and when perceived is non-dual. That actually is [the view of] the Great Perfection (Rdzogs chen), beyond activity and beyond seeing’. These people claim it to be Rdzogs chen, yet they rely on the meditation of the Madhyamaka [system]. The [Rdzogs chen] Spyi bcings167 says: ‘Merely relying on the meditation of the Ston men [Chan school], they claim it to be the supreme Rdzogs chen teachings. This is like a prince descending to become a subject and so contradicts the scriptures’. [...] To these people, their own erroneous views appear as Rdzogs chen’.168 To conclude, we have seen how the Small Treatise as an authentic instruction on the nature of mind within the Chinese Chan tradition was translated into Tibetan in Dunhuang, yet due to the translator’s terminological choices the meaning underwent a slight transformation even during its initial journey from Chinese to Tibetan. Subsequently, when the teachings of the Small Treatise were interpreted by a Tibetan scholar in the Commentary, they were further transformed and also commingled with elements of the Rdzogs chen doctrine. A century later the resulting syncretism became a target of criticism for Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes, who sought to clarify the distinctive qualities of Chan and of Rdzogs   167 The original passage from the Spyi bcings in the Rnying ma rgyud ’bum (Ancient Tantra Collection) could not be identified.
