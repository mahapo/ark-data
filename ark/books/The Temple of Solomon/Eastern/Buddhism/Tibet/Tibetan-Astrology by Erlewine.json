Part of this attraction may be due to the fact that Tibetan astrology is inextricably bound to Tibetan Buddhism. With few exceptions, the primary practicing astrologers in Tibet have for centuries always been and are today Buddhist monks. The word for astrology in Tibetan is “Tsi,” and astrologers are called Tsi-Pa, those who practice “Tsi.” In Tibet to learn something about astrology is to learn something about the dharma and Buddhism, and usually vice versa. Tibetan Buddhist monks all use astrology. I found out early on that I could not just skim the astrology off the top of the Tibetan Buddhism. In order to understand Tibetan astrology, I had to learn something about the Buddhist psychology in which it is embedded. I doubt that I am alone in this. In other words, it is impossible to separate Tibetan astrology from Tibetan Buddhism, so it is important for readers to understand at least something about the Dharma and how it relates to the astrology of Tibet. To best prepare for what follows, here are several concepts that you may need to better understand this material, so please bear with me. First, let’s examine what it is to learn any astrological technique, Tibetan or otherwise."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 28 What is Astrological Technique? Most traditional astrological techniques are originally the residue of a particular insight or astrological realization that someone, somewhere, had. After the initial fire of the original insight is gone (the realization passes), what remains is what we can remember led to the experience, whatever caused us to have the realization in the first place. This is what ritual is all about, trying to recreate a sacred experience – to realize it again. Therefore, most astrological technique amounts to a method to capture or recreate that realization experience, a method or technique realize an experience or insight again, if possible. In our day-to-day work, many of us are given and use techniques for which we have never had realization and in which we have not been fully empowered. We are lucky if we get realization on even several of the many astrological techniques that we use. Unfortunately, that's just the way it is. To realize a technique in the truest sense, we somehow have to do just that, make it real, re-member or actually recreate it. And to do that, ultimately, we must become empowered in that technique through having the actual experience that caused it to arise in the first place or through the guidance of someone who has that realization. This is why I like to study with master astrologers, if I can find them. They have the experience and therefore the capacity to empower us. In short, many of us hope that with the help of a good book or a teacher (and a lot of concentration) we will sooner or later find our way to the experience itself and actually have that experience, the one that originally gave rise to the astrological technique in the first place."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 29 If we can manage that, we can begin to use the technique in something more than a rote or mechanical fashion, for we have ourselves \"realized\" it. It has become part of us; we understand what it is about and how it works. This is even truer when it comes to a whole new kind of astrology such as that which the Tibetans use. We need a guide. Don’t worry; I am not suggesting that I am a teacher in this subject. I am just a fellow traveler, but I am pointing out here that the best guide to Tibetan astrology I know is learning something about its root, the dharma. In the end that is what I had to do. Since it may save you making some of the same mistakes I did, let me briefly tell you how I got into all of this. The Swans and the Lake In the 1970s the head of the Tibetan Karma Kagyu lineage, His Holiness the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa, was asked why he had come to visit America. His answer was: “If there were a lake, the swans would go there.” And so it has been, for the last 25 years or so. Many of the great Tibetan teachers have come to America to visit and to teach the dharma. My interest in all of this stretches back to the 1950s and the beat movement – Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsburg, etc. These writers helped to introduce Buddhism to many of us at that time. Writers like Allan Watts and D.T. Suzuki (who wrote and spoke on Buddhism) educated a whole generation on the subject, but back then it was mostly theoretical. In the late 50s and very early 60s, Buddhism appeared to me as one interesting philosophical view among many others such as Existentialism and the Beat movement itself. Buddhism at that time (of the Allan Watts variety) was necessarily very intellectual and philosophical –"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 30 something to think about and have words over. After all, we were just hearing about it. We would sit up until late at night, smoke cigarettes (I am sorry to say), drink lots of coffee, and talk about such things until the sun came up. It was all very heady. Few of us made the connection that Buddhist thought was not just something else to think or philosophize about, but rather a path or dharma, a method, something to do – a way of action. We knew little of methods. This came much later. It is important to make clear that (as I understand it) Buddhism is not a religion in the ordinary sense of that word. Although I have worked with it for many years, I have never considered myself as particularly religious. Going to church once a week, as most Americans do, is not going to solve many of my problems. I need something I can do all week long. What I was interested in back then was psychology – the human psyche and the mind itself. In fact, my interest in astrology itself can be traced to an interest in the psyche -- how the mind and all of its experiences work. How does the mind work? In the early 70s, Buddhism took the next step to being understood as a practical path when the work of a young Tibetan lama Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche became available. His book \"Cutting through Spiritual Materialism\" is perhaps the best example of what I am pointing toward, a practical Buddhism – mind practice. With Trungpa came the end of Tibetan Buddhism of the through-a-glass-darkly and sit-and-talk-about-it variety. Previous to Trungpa’s appearance, most insight into the inner or astrological side of the Buddhism of Tibet came through writers like Alexandra David-Neal, T. Lobsang Rampa, T. Evans-Wentz, and other early writers on"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 31 what has been called “esoteric Buddhism,” people like H.P. Blavatsky and C.W. Leadbeater. Even then, there was little or no mention of Tibetan astrology per se. These writers were Westerners who could not help but put their own spin on the subject of Buddhism. Trungpa ended that. Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche made it very clear to us that Buddhism was not only a philosophy to think about, but above all a life path to walk, something very practical to put into practice in day-to-day life. He pointed out that Buddhism was primarily a way of handling our experience in this world we live in – a dharma path. I can remember that this came as almost total news to those of us brought up on the intellectual Buddhism of the late 50s and 60s. I met Chögyam Trungpa early in 1974 when I helped to bring him to Ann Arbor, Michigan to speak. I designed the posters for his event and ended up as his chauffer for the weekend. From the moment I picked him up at the airport, suffice it to say that I quickly got a very different take on Buddhism, which leads me to the other main point that I must present before we can discuss Tibetan astrology, and that is meditation. Prior to meeting Trungpa, I had the (quite common) idea that meditation was a method to relax around, a way to get away from the chaos of day-to-day life – a form of stress management. I had never found the time nor interest for it. The whole idea was boring to me. I was way too active to sit still. No sooner had I brought Trungpa Rinpoche back from the airport than he took me into a room with him, closed the door behind us, and proceeded to introduce me to my own mind. Looking back, I realize he was showing me how to meditate, although he didn't call it that. In"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 32 fact, he never named it. And there was no prologue. He did not announce what he was about to do. He just jumped in. At the time I don't believe I was able to grasp all of what was going on. It was only years later that I realized what really happened on that day. What I experienced through his instruction (and in his presence) were some real answers to questions that had always tortured me – big questions, questions about death, about letting go, about actually living life – things like that. Most of all, Trungpa pointed out and demonstrated what real awareness looked and acted like. My response was a simple: “Oh, now I get it.” I watched him enjoying and using his mind in a multitude of ways that I had never considered as possibilities. It was a pure case of monkey see, monkey do, and I wanted to be like he was being. Where I was used to sitting around, twiddling my thumbs, and waiting for the next thing to happen, Trungpa Rinpoche was all over the place, peering, poking at, questioning, and mostly enjoying and investigating every moment and every thing. I wanted to kick myself that I had never thought to make use of my own time like this. Trungpa demonstrated before my eyes that the mind and our awareness could be worked with – practiced. Intuition or true insight could be developed. All you had to do was to try and do it. The mind could be trained. What a thought! My original idea of meditation as at best a way to relax, and at worst a big bore was giving way something much more active. I began to see that meditation had to do with my developing insight and intuition, learning to use my own mind to connect within myself and the taking"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 33 possession or advantage of our current situation – whatever it happens to be. From that day in February 1974, I began to connect more with myself and to explore the so-called outer world in a somewhat different way. Once you see someone do something for real, you know that you can probably do that too. I had seen something done and I wanted to do that too. What I am getting at here is that the primary tool for learning astrology in the Tibetan system is not a set of ephemerides, a series of calculations, and lots of research in books. Instead, it involves establishing this inner connectivity – call it insight, intuition, meditation, mind practice, mind training, whatever you want to call it. When I first saw it, I had no words at the time, but I got the idea. It leapt inside me. I had grown up here in the West where learning astrology is often centered on memorizing the various correspondences between terms, like: Aries relates to Mars, relates to the Ascendant, relates to the first house, and so on. If you can't get into learning about astrological correspondences, then you are going to have real difficulty grasping classic western astrology as it was taught in the 19th and 20th centuries. In Tibetan astrology, the primary educational tool is your own mind and learning to use it and your intuition in a direct and practical way. Tibetans call this \"mind practice\" or most often just “meditation.” Of course they have a dozen or so words for meditation. My point here is that if you approach the Tibetan lamas, you may not find easy access to their astrological teachings without some very basic mind training, not because they won’t share it with you, but because your mind (and probably your life) is a little too chaotic and rushed to get a"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 34 handle on it. You don’t have time for insight. You have to make time. Time is also something we make. And this lack of access to the teachings is not because these matters are in any way secret, but rather because we may lack the one essential tool for grasping them – mental awareness and an active intuition. In this sense, many of these astrological concepts are what have been termed self-secret. The sheer simplicity, openness, and directness of the subject is closed to us because of our own inherent confusion and complexity – our internal white noise. What to do? I can well remember my first meeting with a Tibetan lama at which I asked about the Tibetan astrological tradition. I was just after Christmas and we had driven 800 miles during the coldest day of that year, and with my entire family. As we reached the top of a mountain in upstate New York where the lama’s monastery is located, we could only see out of the car by scraping a tiny spot on the frosted windshield. It was that cold. Having arrived at the monastery in the dark of night, we were ushered into a small room for a very brief interview. We waited. In time, the rinpoche came in and welcomed us. He did not speak a word of English, but he did have a translator. I then explained through the translator my interest in astrology and the fact that I had worked for so very many years in this field and was even somewhat known for my astrological work. Secretly I was hoping somehow to be able to skip a few rungs, perhaps like that boring \"Meditation 101,\" and enter one of the more interesting advanced practices that I had imagined must exist. The lama listened patiently to me and then began to speak very slowly. Very kindly, he said that although he could see that I had never harmed anyone with my"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 35 astrology, still, in this area of working with the mind, it was best for me to start at the very beginning point with meditation. He explained what I should do. And then he was gone. I was deflated. I left the monastery in somewhat of a daze and that night my family and I were sheltered nearby in a tiny motel room with one small wall heater. The night was bitter cold. We were 800 miles from home. And it was in that moment that I felt I had to decide to accept his advice and start at the very beginning or follow my pride and refuse to admit that, after all my years of spiritual work, I knew little to nothing about the mind and meditation, and would have to start at the beginning like anyone else. I am forever grateful that I was able to admit to myself that I knew nothing about mind practice and would just have to begin at the beginning. When we got back home to Michigan, my wife and I went and got instruction on how to meditate properly and, very slowly, began to learn about mind practice. That has to be one of the key decisions made in my life. My point is that here in the West we have so much going for us technically and educationally, with so many tools at our fingertips, but there is one topic that for the most part is not taught here and about which we know little to nothing, and that is about the nature of the mind itself. And I am not talking about philosophy or psychology. I am talking about our personal skill at looking at the mind itself. For example, look now at who is reading this page. Who is that? Where does that “who” reside? Is he or she in there somewhere? If so, just where? You get the idea. We seldom (if ever) inquire, much less set out to learn about the mind."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 36 That is what mind training is all about and most of us in this culture have yet to begin that training. That being said, here is something a little more traditional on the topic of the astrology of Tibet. This is not primarily a book about the history and culture of astrology in Tibet. My motivation for writing here is to share with you what I have learned on this subject over the last thirty years or so. Hopefully you will come away with at least some idea what Tibetan astrology is actually all about and how it compares to Western astrology. For there, you can decide if you would like to learn more. However, some brief comments on the origin of Tibetan astrology is warranted. The Astrology of Tibet Although Tibetan history is ancient, its records are largely symbolic before somewhere around 600 A.D. The tradition states that the Tibetan civilization started somewhere in the fertile Yarlung Valley along the great Tsangpo River in the south-central part of Tibet. Tibet’s cultural relationship with China over their long history has always been fairly constant and mostly somewhat difficult. Even though Tibet was small compared to China, this did not mean that Tibet always had little influence. During one of the better periods (around the Yuan dynasty -13th century), the Chinese rulers actually adopted Tibetan Buddhism and there ensued a period of great cultural exchange. In particular the 8th Tai Situ Rinpoche, Chökyi Jungne, traveled extensively in China and was very active as an astrologer. It is speculated that the Chinese Princess Wen-Ch’eng’s move from China to Tibet in 641 A.D. involved bringing with her the Yi-Ching and other philosophical and perhaps geomantic texts. This was probably a"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 37 watershed event intellectually. It is written that she brought with her 360 works on divination, although that number itself seems symbolic. The point here is that the geomantic and astrological roots of China were transmitted and mixed into Tibetan culture somewhere around that time, if they were not already present. In particular geomancy and astrology were important to the Bön-po, the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet as part of their interest in the Lords of the Earth, the Sa-Dag, literally: Earth Lords. These same topics are spread throughout all the major lineages of Tibetan Buddhism today. Tibetan Buddhism, astrology, and the geomantic practices are intertwined, although distinct. Along with the Yi-Ching came the Lo-Shu or Magic square, and the eight Parkhas or trigrams. The Magic Square is a square made up of nine numbers arranged in a square, in which any three numbers add up to 15. More about this later. Kar-Tsi and Jung-Tsi: The Two Streams The astrology of the Tibetans stems largely from two sources, India and China, and this fact is clearly reflected in the Tibetan astrology system, by the words Kar-Tsi and Jung-Tsi, which translate to \"white astrology\" and \"black astrology.\" Kar-Tsi (white astrology) comes from India and represents the dharma, the actual teachings of the Buddha, and things mostly having to do with the calculation of ephemerides, and so forth, while Jung-Tsi (black astrology) comes from China, and includes the geomantic and divinatory aspects of the Tibetan tradition, the trigrams, the five elements, and so forth. Black and white here refers to colors only, and carries no suggestion of good and evil. The Chinese divinatory sciences, astrology in particular, are said to have arisen in an area in China called Wu-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 38 Tai Shan, which consists of five sacred mountains, four mountains arranged in the form of a square with a central mountain in the middle. From the area of these five mountains (so it is written) arose an emanation of the Buddhist bodhisattava Manjushri, the deity especially connected to astrology. Manjushri arose as a youth and from his head issued a golden tortoise, from which emanated a vast number of teachings (84,000) that relate to astrology. Humankind, so it is written, soon took to the astrology, even to the point of ignoring the actual dharma teachings of Lord Buddha. Manjushri, who was displeased by this, is said to have then hidden the astrology teachings on the eastern side of the Wu-Tai Shan mountains as what is called terma or hidden dharma, and from that point astrology was lost to humankind. Without astrology, mankind was unable to guide itself through the obstacles of life, and so suffered greatly. However, after a time (and at the suggestion of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, who pitied mankind’s suffering) Guru Rinpoche (perhaps the greatest Tibetan saint) petitioned Manjushri to please restore the astrological teachings and to teach him the tradition, so that he could share them once again with the Tibetan people. In his petition to Manjushri, Guru Rinpoche made it clear that although astrology and the divinatory practices are not a part of the dharma as taught by Buddha, nevertheless they are of great importance to mankind on a relative, if not an absolute, basis. I can testify to this view myself. When I approached by own teacher, a Tibetan rinpoche, as to the validity of astrology, he affirmed its usefulness, but said this: “Astrology is one of"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 39 the limbs of the yoga, but not the root.” The dharma teachings of Buddha are the root. My point here is that until such time as we can develop full awareness, astrology can be useful to us on a relative basis in guiding us through life’s obstacles. In other words, in the confused world we often find ourselves in, bewildered by our own ignorance of what is real, and stumbling around, astrology and the other divinatory practices can help to point the way through the confusion to greater clarity. Beyond that, as I understand it, astrology has no particular merit. Astrology is one of the relative truths, but not the absolute truth. This explanation made immediate sense to me and is typical of the kind of wisdom I have come to expect from Tibetan dharma teachers."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 40 Summary The Tibetan system of astrology is a combination of Indian and Chinese methods, the greater and most essential (meaning) part being taken from the Chinese, and with the technical (calculation) element tending to come from the Indian system. Of course, the Buddhist dharma itself came from India. The Indian or technical part (ephemerides, lunar tables, etc.) is called Kar-Tsi and the Chinese or spiritual part, is called Jung-Tsi. The Tibetans, who were short on calculation ability, originally borrowed whatever planetary tables they use from the Indians, and don't depend upon these planetary ephemerides for much of their system. They make great use of the 12-year cycle of the animal signs plus the five-fold element sequence as used in the various forms of Chinese astrology (Jung-Tsi). The Kar-Tsi came from the Indian system along with the dharma and the Kalachakra Tantra. The quintessential portion of the Indian system of value to the Tibetans is the division of the lunar month into 30 equal parts, called \"tithis\" in the Indian system. Tibetan astrology is lunar-based, with the Sun (and all the planets) taking a secondary position to the Moon. As proof of this, witness the fact that your Tibetan birthday is not your solar birthday (or yearly return), but the lunar phase-angle day on which you were born. Thus you would celebrate your birthday on that 25th (or whatever) day of the lunar month you were born in. Note: not the 25th calendar date (which is solar), but the 25th lunar day as measured from the previous New Moon. Astrologers in general seem to love to manipulate cycles and numbers. The Tibetans (even lacking planetary calculations) make up for it with the manipulation of the various cycles they do use. In"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 41 Tibetan astrology, numbers are counted forward, backward, and around in many different combinations. It is just complicated enough so that not everyone can do it. It requires an astrologer, a Tsi-Pa. In fact, it is ironic that astrology, East and West, seems to be just complex enough that the average person can't do it for themselves and requires some expert to do it for them. I guess that is how we make a living. Although my experience with the system is not that great, it is enough to assure me that the net result of the Tibetan calculation methods is quite similar in effect or portent to Western methods. After all, the point of any kind of astrology is to provide some kind of personal direction, perhaps to establish a dialogue between the individual and the cosmos – an oracle. Astrology is a complex oracle. In other words, the amount of information or life direction (if you will) is of the same caliber (and quantity) as similar material here in the West. The chief exception to this generalization is the use of the lunar cycle in day-to-day life. It is here that the Tibetan system excels and has a great deal to offer Westerners. Here in the West the awareness of the lunar cycle has been lost or trivialized. It is interesting to note that although few high lamas I have met make that much use of the cycle of the animal signs, elements, Parkhas and Mewas that I shall present (some do), they all seem to depend upon the cycle of the lunar days for creating their practice and teaching calendars. In other words, much of Tibetan astrology is considered non-essential or of secondary (lesser) importance to the formal Buddhist practitioner. However, this opinion does not extend to the lunar cycle, which is accorded much attention."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 42 To sum up this very, very brief discussion of how Tibetan astrology as we know it today originated, Tibet took from both India and China, but primarily (aside from the dharma teachings), in its heart essence, it is the Chinese influence that governs the meaning of Tibetan astrology, the Jung-Tsi. In other words, concepts like the Parkha (eight trigrams), Mewa (Lo-Shu numbers), animal zodiac, and so forth, were taken from China and are precious to Tibetans. Vedic (Indian) astrology and its meanings did not take root, outside of the 30-day lunar cycle, which cycle is crucial to the Tibetan approach. Of course the dharma and the Kalachakra Tantra came from India. Remember that the dharma is the root or heart of the astrology. These two streams of influence mixed together historically and the Tibetans assimilated them, changing, modifying, and above all incorporating them. They made them their own, and in many cases re-wrote history as if they originated these concepts. In some cases, perhaps they did. In particular, as a matter of course, Manjushri was considered the origin of all the astrological teachings, whether or not they originally came from China. Manjushri is the deity from whom these kinds of concepts are in essence born. It is clear from writings from the 18th century onward that Tibetans were skilled in all manner of the divinatory arts, not just astrology. This included divinations based on mirrors, dreams, casting lots, arrows, malas (prayer beads), yantras, lamps, stones, drums, bones, bowls of water, cards, medical examination, and of course, mediumistic oracles, to name a few. Astrology and most of the other forms of divination were performed by Buddhist monks rather than lay people,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 43 although it seems that all lay people follow at least some of the indicators, such as the various element combinations. For the most part, monks handle not only the dharma rituals, but also astrology and the other forms of divination. Even the highest rinpoches often practice what is called “Mo,” a form of divination, and it is common practice to approach a Tibetan lama with a burning question and ask them to do a “Mo” on that question. Some lamas don’t do divination, and the Nyingma lineage (as a whole) is probably the most oriented to these forms of divination. When asked to do a Mo, a lama may do it on the spot for you or ask you to come back later or the next day to receive the answer. And the answers to Mo questions are seldom very mysterious, but usually very matter of fact, like: “Yes, do go back to school,” or “No, don’t travel there.” As mentioned earlier, astrologers are called “Tsi-Pa” in Tibetan and every monastery has a Tsi-Pa, almost by default, just as here in the West there is almost always someone who knows a little astrology, and astrological questions inevitably fall to that person. It is the same in Tibet, although monasteries always require some astrology to set up their schedule for group practice, since it is based on the lunation cycle."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 44 Where I Came In My own background in learning about Tibetan astrology started around 1974 when I met the Ven. Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and the 16th Gyalwa Karma, Rigpe Dorje, and with my asking just about every rinpoche I encountered about astrology. Surprisingly, most of them knew (or claimed they knew) very little, and often their only interest seemed to be reading the small Tibetan practice-calendar books, looking for dates for this or that kind of practice. As an student who was trying to studying Buddhist psychology and also learning about mind training, I continued to be fascinated by Tibetan astrology. My reasoning went something along the lines of: if their psychology is so powerful (which it indeed is), their astrology must also reflect this as well. I read through the various Buddhist scholarly works in which astrology was even mentioned, finding only an occasional few"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 45 words and the odd diagram here or there. There was no sense of any comprehensive understanding. I then met John Reynolds, an American who was studying Tibetan Buddhism and who also had an interest in Tibetan Astrology. He spoke and read Tibetan fluently. I set up a workshop here in Big Rapids, Michigan and John came and gave a seminar on Tibetan astrology. This was in the early 1980s. I learned a lot from meeting Reynolds, but most of all I remember these words of John’s to me. He said that in order to learn Tibetan astrology, you have to learn the Buddhist psychology around which it was based. He confided to me that the Buddhist psychology was much more interesting to him than the astrology, and that he had become fascinated with that, leaving the astrology somewhat unfinished. “Interesting,” said I. Sange Wangchuk My next step was to invite Nepalese Sange Wangchuk and his wife Tseten to come and reside at our center here in Michigan in 1985. Wangchuk, a former monk, skilled calligrapher, and artist was fluent in seven languages, including Tibetan, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Hindi, Pali, and Sanskrit. Today Wangchuk is director of the National Library of Bhutan. Sange Wangchuk spent 2 1/2 years with us and, during that time, we translated"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 46 a lot of Tibetan astrology from the original manuscripts, mostly the works of the 3rd Gyalwa Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje. This really helped me fill in many of the blanks. I was finally learning. By now I was also working on learning what meditation practice was all about. But like John Reynolds, I was becoming increasingly seduced by the Buddhist psychology at the expense of the astrology. There is no doubt about the fact that if it is personal results you are interested in, the Tibetan Buddhist psychological teachings are the very essence of that of which astrologers dream. Or, as mentioned earlier: astrology is one of the limbs of the yoga, but not the root or trunk itself. Sooner or later you want to learn about the root. The Buddhist psychological or dharma teachings themselves are the root, and these profound teachings are deserving of the respect they inspire. They have value because they help an individual orient him or herself within their current situation and provide a method for them to take action of a clarifying and creative nature. By this time, our center here in Big Rapids had become one of the primary centers in North America for the translation, transcription, and publication of Buddhist texts of the Karma Kagyu tradition. We had become the Heart Center KTC (Karma Thedsum Choling), and affiliate of KTD (Karma Triyana Dharmachakra) Monastery in Woodstock, New York. For many years, we maintained a full-time publication staff, starting in 1986. During our time together, I worked with Sange Wangchuk translating from a number of astrology texts (he did the translating), and we put together an outline for Tibetan astrology, some of which was published by"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 47 Wieser in a book on Eastern astrology some years ago. Among other things as mentioned, Wangchuk translated some of the astrology teachings of the 3rd Gyalwa Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje. I also programmed most of the Tibetan astrological techniques and released a program in May of 1998. A new and expanded version of that program has been released in 2007 and is available at StarTypes.com. In the summer of 1997 our center brought Dr. Drubgyud Tendar to our complex, the Heart Center KTC here in Big Rapids. Dr. Tendar was an accomplished Tibetan astrologer and Tibetan doctor, who had been trained at Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim in the Tsurphu tradition (the astrological methods used by the Karma Kagyu Lineage), originating from His Holiness, the 3rd Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje. Together we worked to reconstruct the calculations for the traditional Tsurphu calendar and thus try to preserve its integrity. In the late summer of 1997 my family and I traveled to Tibet and we were able to present our preliminary results to the head of the Karma Kagyu Lineage, His Holiness Urgyen Trinley Dorje, the 17th Karmapa. The Karmapa is the actual “Golden Child” after which the Eddie Murphy movie was based. I also traveled to Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim, the seat of His Holiness, Rigpe Dorje, the 16th Karmapa, where I met with one of the main astrologers at that monastery. While traveling in the East, I was also able to present our work to the Venerable Bokar Rinpoche and His Eminence, Gyaltsap Rinpoche. I continued to work with Dr. Drubjud Tendar through the fall of 1997 to complete the calculations we had been working on. In the spring of 2006, I met Khenpo Ugyen Tenzin, who was Senior Abbot at Nalanda Institute of Rumtek,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 48 Sikkim. Lama Ugyen had been thoroughly trained in the Tsurphu method of astrology and he was able to clear up some questions that had been troubling me. And lately I have been getting some help from Edward Henning, a translator of Tibetan and a scholar of Tibetan astrology. Henning, who in my opinion is doing the most important work in this field, helped to translate much of the material about the Tibetan Earth Lords, the Sa-Dak found in this book. I should also mention my main dharma teacher, the Ven. Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche, who has worked with me since 1983. Khenpo Rinpoche has been of invaluable help, far beyond any words I could possible write. In addition, Ven. Bardor Tulku Rinpoche has also been very helpful in many ways, including providing the verbal reading or instructions (Tibetan: Lung) for the Tibetan Mo form of divination. Lamas and rinpoches that have been helpful in my journey to learn something about Tibetan astrology are many, and they include Lama Karma Duldul, Lama Yeshe Gyamtso, Ven. Thrangu Rinpoche, Ven. Bokar Rinpoche, His Eminence Gyaltsap Rinpoche, His Eminence Jamgon Rinpoche, His Eminence Shamar Rinpoche, His Eminence Tai Situ Rinpoche, and of course His Holiness the 16th Karmapa, Rigpe Dorje, and His Holiness the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje. You would think that with all this help I would know a lot by now, but I am still just learning the essentials. Much of this is due to the fact that to learn the Tibetan astrology system, you have to first learn and practice the dharma, and that has been much more difficult to learn and do than the astrology part of it. I am still working on that."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 49 Astrology is Astrology is ...

The net result is that the Tibetan system of astrology is a somewhat complex system that, like its Western counterpart, allows so much interpretation that hard and fast conclusions can seldom be drawn. As far as I can determine, one can't predict the stock market with either Tibetan or Western astrology, at least I can’t. If I could, our center here would be much larger.

For it to be any use to us, we must be able to listen. Astrology as an Oracle We probably can agree that astrology is a somewhat complex and intricate oracle. There is another factor in Eastern astrology that deserves general comment. It has been the view of Western observers that the East has a tendency toward fatalism and resignation to whatever fate has delivered to them. I was always somewhat surprised that most of the Tibetan lamas and teachers that I met (outside of using the lunar cycle to plan and time events) were not all that interested in the astrology. Perhaps astrology may have a number of more secret uses in Tibetan Buddhism, which are not presented to the general public, and of which I am not aware of. One thing I can report is that Tibetans are not interested in the kind of astrology of personality so popular here in the West."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 51 To the Buddhist mind, our personality makeup is not really all that important. Unlike Western astrology, Tibetan astrology is not an astrology of personality. For, no matter what our personal makeup, good or bad, the remedy remains the same from the Buddhist point of view: mind practice of one form or another. In fact, throughout the East, you do not find the interest in personality psychology that we have here in the West. The reason is clear to anyone who has studied Eastern philosophy. They have no need to flirt with the deeper areas of the mind, but have long ago been introduced to matters of psychology, and assume them as a matter of course, rather than as a novelty. Here in the West we are just beginning to learn about the training of the mind. Psychology here is still new to us. Remember that reincarnation is the accepted belief system in both India and Tibet and, for that matter (in sheer numbers of people), the greater part of the world. They have, as a standing belief, what we have as yet to accept – the continuity of consciousness beyond death. They are the majority, we the minority. Here in the West, this awareness of cycles or life beyond physical death is not self-evident to most of us. As astrologers, we may attempt to bring it to the public's attention. Yet as a society, we have yet to come to such a conclusion, much less push toward making this a part of our day-to-day beliefs. Buddhist countries, long trained in the analysis of emotions and desires, have little interest in re-examining emotional and personality issues, which have already been clarified in ancient times. Instead, the interest in expanding the awareness of the person (happy or sad) beyond such personal issues and focusing on the actual"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 52 root of our problems and sufferings is assumed. Everyone over there in Asia knows this from childhood. Any Western astrologer can easily check this out for himself by doing an astrological reading for an East Indian. They are not remotely interested in our psychological observations. Concepts that fascinate us here in the West like: soul, spirit, unity, are already their old friends. Their response to our psychological pap is \"Yes, yes, yes... please get on to something of importance, like exactly how many children will I have, and what will their sexes be?\" Or, \"How much money will I make this year and when?\" There is no point in hinting to a Tibetan or Hindu that consciousness may extend beyond this life or that he or she is somehow “one” with the creative forces. That is for them already a given, a fact upon which they have depended all of their lives. The psychological crib out of which we Westerners are just learning to climb (when it comes to the mind), the continuity of consciousness, and all that these thoughts suggest, is old news in China, India, Tibet, and most of Asia for that matter. The fact that the whole world is, in reality, our personal mandala and that everything that appears to us is a sign from the cosmos may be a revelation to a New Yorker, but not so for a resident of Katmandu or Delhi. While here in this country we continue to explore our psychological infancy, this holds little interest for those from the East.

I have tried to arrange it so that some of the main concepts and techniques are presented first, but it is really up to you. Of course, everyone knows about the twelve animal signs, and you may want to know what the element-animal combination for the year you were born is, like: “Year of the ??” While it can be read sequentially and this works pretty well that way, a better approach might be to browse the table of contents for something that interests you and check that out. Some sections are very general, while others offer step-by-step calculation methods. If you are just browsing, you may want to skip over the more technical stuff.

I would very much like to hear about them. Michael Erlewine June 2007 Michael@Erlewine.net "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 55 The Tibetan Calendar The heart of Tibetan astrology is the annual almanac or Tibetan calendar. Every lama and monk has one. Here we will go over what you might expect to find in the average almanac, but this is not the place (and I am not the expert) on all the subtleties of the Tibetan calendar system. I refer readers to the very excellent book by Edward Henning, “Kalachakra And the Tibetan Calendar,” which should be available by the time your read this. Here it will have to suffice to lay out the general characteristics, point out some of the problems involved, and mention how some students of the subject are dealing with them. I don’t know how many lamas and rinpoches I have approached with questions I have about the Tibetan calendar system, but it seems that most of them are not concerned with this kind of detail. They tend to use the Tibetan astrological calendar as it is handed to them, with no questions asked. The problem is that these small practice calendars (and there are quite a few of them) for the most part don’t even state what time zone the calendar refers to and, as any astrologer here in the West knows, you can’t list the time of the New Moon, without declaring the time zone it refers to. Is it India or New York? You need to know. Before getting too much deeper into this, it is crucial that you understand why this type of astrological calendar is produced in the first place, and that has to do with group dharma practice, for these are primarily practice calendars. If one is coordinating the practice schedule at a large monastery with perhaps several hundred monks, everyone has to agree on what calendar day and time"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 56 any group practice should convene. The various astrological indicators like the moment of the New Moon, the moment when the Moon changes lunar mansions, and so on are not so considerate. The natural astronomical phenomena change when they change and that’s that. That’s a given. If the Full Moon occurs at 3 o’clock in the morning, this is not a time when just everyone at a monastery is likely to be up and ready for practice. So, as a hedge against the natural order of things, the communal practice calendar was drawn up. It really is a compromise and goes against the grain of how one might imagine this astrological information ideally might be used. In other words, in some ways almanacs are counter-intuitive, trying to pigeonhole natural events, but it is easy to understand why these compromises are made. What the Tibetans have done with the practice calendar (in most cases) is to declare sunrise for a given day as the point to take the surrounding astrological temperature, so to speak. Somewhere around 5 A.M. is the time when Tibetan almanacs sample indicators like which lunar day it is, what Nakshatra (lunar mansion) is in play, which Karana, and so on. These indicators are listed in the astrological almanac for sunrise, even through the actual time most of these indicators actually began could be as far off as much as almost 24 hours. In other words, these calendars indicate where a given astrological factor is at 5 A.M., which says nothing about when it started. For example: If at sunrise on a given day, it is the 10th lunar day, that day could change to the 11th lunar day five minutes later, and so literally the entire calendar day would be in the 11th lunar day, but still be listed as the 10th day. You get the idea. Whenever we make up rules"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 57 like this, there is compromise and some information is lost. In this case, the information can be (in my opinion) quite important. It is understandable that for group practice, decisions have to be made that cut through the niceties of monitoring the actual changes that the sky offers us. However, something valuable is lost. Today, more and more dharma students (who are not engaged in group practice) are beginning to use astrological calendars in which the exact time of various astrological changes are listed. Instead of following the group listings for sunrise, these students note when the actual change from one lunar day (or whatever indicator they are using) changes and time their practice based on that. This only makes sense. If you use an astrological almanac or calendar, be sure to keep these thoughts in mind and to ask at least what time zone whatever time listings give are calculated in. Zodiacs: Tropical or Sidereal? As to which zodiac to use: this is an even thornier problem and I will not get into the long history of Tibetan zodiacs. Please consult Edward Henning’s book for more details. Let me just be very general here: There are two main kinds of zodiacs used by astrologers, the tropical and the sidereal. The tropical zodiac can be defined as one where the zero-degrees Aries) can be characterized as the point in the heavens when the transiting Sun reaches the vernal equinox. In the sidereal zodiac, the first point of Aries is measured not in reference to equinoxes or solstices, but from some key point or star out there in the heavens – nothing to do with the equinox or Earth."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 58 While there can be no argument as to the definition of the tropical zodiac, as you might imagine, sidereal astrologers have seldom agreed which star should be the starting point for their zodiac, although they do more or less agree on the general area of the heavens where this point should be found, somewhere in the constellations Aries to Pisces. This dispute has gone on for centuries and will not be elaborated on here. The tropical zodiac (the earth’s general frame of reference) is very gradually shifting, and this very slow shift is called precession, with the result that the zero-degree Aries point is drifting backward in the zodiac something just less than a minute of arc a year – some 50 seconds. A long time ago, around 1,500 years, the two zodiacs (tropical and sidereal) matched up, but since that time they have slowly drifted apart until today they are something like 30 degrees apart, thus the confusion. I will not go into more detail about the phenomenon of precession or the history and practice of these two zodiacs (tropical and sidereal) in the astrological tradition. There are many good books out there that handle this. What we want to know here is what system is used in Tibetan astrology? The main treatise on astrology in India is the Kalachakra Tantra, which came from India and literally translates as the “Wheel of Time.” The Kalachakra clearly uses the tropical zodiac, as Tibetan scholar Edward Henning points out in his book on that topic. However, most Indian astrology today is sidereal, so many assume that the Kalachakra would share this quality. It does not. The Kalachakra depends on the moment the Sun reaches the winter solstice, and this by definition is the tropical zodiac."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 59 The long and the short of all this, and it is bad news too, is that most Tibetan astrologers today use a zodiac that is neither tropical nor sidereal. It is somewhere in between. As Edward Henning so aptly puts it, it is “simply wrong,” a product of misunderstandings technically. As a student who has great respect for the lamas and the Tibetan dharma tradition, I found it very difficult to confront these few areas of knowledge which are not particularly enlightened, and where errors have been compounded and passed on for so long that they become hard to challenge or question. This is one of those areas. The upshot is that the Tibetans intended to use the tropical zodiac as indicated by the Kalachakra, but due perhaps to confusion when bringing the system into Tibet from India, something was lost along the way and they were left with a zodiac that is neither fish nor fowl, neither tropical or strictly sidereal. It is something of a red herring. Modern astrologers are simply tiptoeing around this problem. The Tibetans, in general, are deep into the concept of not throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and it is difficult to change anything, especially in the chaos that has threatened the entire system since Tibet has been in political upheaval. The Lunar Months We have a similar problem with the definition of the twelve lunar months as defined by the Chinese, the Phugpa tradition (Dalai Lama and Gelugpa Lineage) and the Tsurphu tradition (the Karmapa and Kagyu Lineage.) These three systems do not always agree on Losar, the Tibetan New Year, which marks the first month of any year. The one thing they all agree on is that the point of the New Moon marks the start of the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 60 year, but which New Moon? These three systems can be off from one another by an entire month, and sometimes are. The Phugpa system is the most divergent from the other two, with the Tsurphu system generally agreeing with the Chinese New Year, but not always. You and I are not going to solve this for the Tibetans and the Chinese, so the most we can do is note it and not be surprised if we discover that two different astrological calendars for the same year have the start of the New Year on different dates. Since so much depends on when the year starts, you can imagine the problems. The Lunar Days: Double and Omitted I have described the lunar month of 30 days elsewhere in this book. What I want to point out here is the existence of what are called double and omitted days in Tibetan astrological calendars. This concept is actually quite simple, and depends on the length of the solar or calendar day, which is measured from mean sunrise of one calendar day to mean sunrise of the next calendar day, approximately 24 hours. Since lunar days depend on the relation of the Moon to the Sun and the Moon goes faster in one part of its orbit and slower in another, the following takes place: it can happen that the Moon is in a particular lunar day at sunrise of one calendar day, and the Moon is moving so fast that it reaches the start of the next lunar day (not calendar day) BEFORE the next calendar day’s sunrise. In this case that short lunar day is not noted on either the first or second calendar day, but is simply omitted from the calendar. The reverse situation also holds. When the Moon is moving very slowly in its orbit, it can happen that the same lunar day is noted at the sunrise of two"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 61 contiguous calendar dates, thus effectively doubling that lunar date on the calendar. Please keep in mind that omitted or doubled days are only an artifice of the solar calendar. No lunar day is actually lost or doubled. They are all there. The Intercalary: Lunar and Solar Months We have mostly been describing the lunar months in this book, which are measured from the moment of New Moon to the succeeding New Moon. These months, as we have pointed out, do not neatly match up with the standard solar calendar month. We should differentiate between lunar months and the solar month or what are called the \"solar terms.” Solar months have to do with the passage of the Sun through the tropical zodiac, and the first solar term or solar month is called by the Chinese the “Beginning of Spring.” In Chinese and Tibetan astrology, it begins the moment the Sun reaches 15 degrees of the tropical zodiac sign Aquarius (15° Aquarius), which takes place somewhere around February 4th or 5th each year. From the Chinese point of view, the familiar vernal equinox (0° Aries) is the middle of spring, not the beginning. As mentioned, lunar and solar months do not neatly match, and the number of lunar months in a solar calendar year (Gregorian calendar) are more than the standard twelve calendar months we all know. The net result is that every 32.5 lunar months, these extra lunar days accumulate to the point that an extra (intercalary) month has to be added to that year’s calendar. Just as we occasionally add an extra day at the end of February in the solar, an extra month is added every few years."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 62 Another point to keep in mind is that the Tibetans use the mean longitude of the Sun for their calculations, and not the true longitude that astronomers would use. This has been a quick overview. I have tried here to point out a few of the calendar concepts that concern the Tibetan astrologer – some of the problems. It would take most of a book just to define what these problems are and how best to view them. Luckily that book exists in Edward Hennings “Kalachakra And the Tibetan Calendar.” Please see that book for a very thorough explanation of these matters. Solar Calendar Data Included in some Tibetan astrological calendars (often listed last) is what has been called the “solar data,” which term has nothing to do with the movement of the sun or any other astronomical calculations. Here, the term “solar” refers the solar calendar, which the entire world uses, where each year is divided into months and days, and we count through our calendar, day by day, just as we cycle through the days of the week in strict order (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.), although any connection to the planet for each weekday (Monday = Moon, etc.) is purely symbolic at this point. In the same way, the Tibetans cycle through a number of the principle astrological factors, including the twelve animals, the ten yogas (element combinations), the eight trigrams, and the nine Mewa. Each of these cycles is based on an epoch or starting day and continued forward. Edward Henning in his excellent book “Kalachakra and the Tibetan Calendar,” lists these positions for the New Moon on March 1, 1995 as: "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 63 Ten Elements 6 Iron 12 Animals 0 Hare Eight Trigrams 4 Khen Nine Mewas 6 4 Green Lunar Mansion Uttarabhadrapada (#25) The above are based on: 10 Elements Fire 1, 2 Earth 3, 4 Iron (Metal) 5, 6 Water 7, 8 Wood 9, 0 12 Animals Hare 0 Dragon 1 Etc. ...

If the result is “0,” then that is registered as a “1.” Both the Phugpa (Gelugpa Lineage) and the Tsurphu (Karma Kagyu Lineage) calculation results agree on these cycles.

This solar data is not based on any astronomical principles, per se, but is derived, much like our day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) from a simple counting through the cycle. This is true for daily elements, animals, lunar mansions, trigrams, and Mewa. This solar data is most used by dharma practitioners using the Tsurphu calendar, in particular the lineage known as the Karma Kagyu."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 65 The Twelve Animal Signs The wheel of the animal zodiac is ancient, arising somewhere in central Asia and later incorporated by the Chinese. The calendar used by the Chinese is said to have entered Tibet in the year 642 AD by the Chinese Princess Kong-jo, who married the first Buddhist King of Tibet. The Tibetan wheel of twelve animals, with its twelve-fold division, reminds us of its Western counterpart, the familiar zodiac. Unlike the West, where your astrological Sun sign is determined by the solar calendar, in the East your sign is determined according to which year you are born in. The cycle of twelve animals rotates in strict succession from year to year. The order of the animals is Mouse, Ox, Tiger, Hare, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Bird, Dog, and Pig. Each animal sign has its own qualities, which are well-known to the general Asian public, just like most folks know"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 66 something about Sun Sign astrology here in the West. What sign are you? However, please note that these years are not measured from either your birthday or from January 1st of any year. Instead, they are measured from the beginning of the Tibetan New Year, a fluctuating point that (in general) marks the New Moon that is nearest to the beginning of February. It is important to note that on occasion, the start of the Tibetan and Chinese New Years can differ by an entire month! Even the two Tibetan-style calendars covered here, the Tsurphu (Karma Kagyu Lineage) and the Phugpa (Gelugpa Lineage) can, on occasion, differ by one month! The animal of one's birth year is central to both the Tibetan and Chinese systems of calculation, and is the most common form of counting time. The twelve-year animal cycle repeats itself from year to year. Just as we might inquire about a person's Sun sign, in the East they want to know what element and animal sign were you born under. There is also an element-animal combination for each month, each day, and each double-hour."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 67 Your Animal Year It will be important for you to know the animal year you were born in. For most, it will be as simple as looking at the charts on the following pages, finding the year of your birth and noting which Element-Animal combination you were born under. For example, I was born in July of 1941. Looking at the charts, I can see that I was born in the year of the Iron-Snake. The Tibetan year is measured from Tibetan New Year to Tibetan New Year, and the date of the New Year depends on when a particular New Moon occurs somewhere between January and March. So, if you were born in those months, you will need to take an additional step and consult the Year-Change Charts on the pages following the first three diagrams to determine which Tibetan year you belong to. On these additional pages, you will find a list of years from 1900 to 2050. Look up the year you were born and on that row or line is the month, day, and time of the New Moon which marks the exact beginning of that Tibetan year. The time is given in Greenwich Mean Time, which is five hours ahead of New York, which is on Eastern Standard Time. You may have to adjust for your time particular zone. When that is done, if you were born at or after that date and time, then use the element-animal combination for that year. If you were born BEFORE that date and time, use the element-animal combination for the previous year. Also note that two calendar systems are listed, the Tsurphu system, which is that of Karma Kagyu lineage (The Karmapa) and the Phugpa system, which is that of the Gelugpa lineage (Dalai Lama). The last column in each list tells whether there was an eclipse on that day,"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 68 Annular, Total, or Partial. As to which system to use, this depends upon the Tibetan Buddhist lineage you are affiliated with. Most use the Phugpa system, since that belongs to the Gelugpa Lineages and His Holiness the Dalai Lama. I use the Tsurphu system, since that belongs to the Karma Kagyu lineage and His Holiness the Gyalwa Karmapa.

The 12 animals rotate in strict sequence, while each of the five elements persists for two years, and then rotate to the next in the element series. These 60-year Tibetan cycles are measured from the year 1027, the year that the Kalachakra teachings are said to have come to Tibet, although the similar cycle from the Chinese version of this cycle marks the year 1024 as the start. The difference is three years and that is why the list above starts with the year of the Female Fire-Hare, rather than the Male Wood Mouse. In any case, the difference in starting points does not change what animal-element combination goes with which year. At the close of each sixty-year cycle, the entire cycle begins again. Below are all sixty animal-element combinations along with an Astro*Image and interpretive text. These are translations directly from the Tibetan. Please not that some of the statements appear very matter of fact, like that you will live 75 years, etc. Tibetans take these with a grain of salt and understand them to be general statements that give a flavor of what this combination is all about.

In the West we ask questions like: “What is your Sun Sign?” or “What is your birthday?” Our calendar is solar or Sun based. In Tibet and many other Asian countries, although the Sun is also important, it is the Moon that rules and the cycles of the Moon. In Tibet they don’t celebrate birthdays as we do here. However, Tibetans might want to know on what lunar day you were born. In other words, Tibetan months should not be confused with months as we have them in calendars here in the West (January, February, etc.). In Tibet, a month means a lunar month, and a lunar month is measured from New Moon to New Moon. Tibetans have a year of twelve or thirteen lunar months, and the starting and ending times and dates for these lunar months (their New Year) is not fixed. They vary. As mentioned earlier on, Tibetans have special lunar almanacs to keep track of this. The Tibetan New Year (which is called “Losar”) does not start on January 1st as does the Western calendar year. Instead, the beginning of the year in Tibet is a fluctuating point that (in general) starts with the day after the New Moon that is nearest to the beginning of February. But even that is not written in stone. For example, the Tibetan and Chinese New Year celebrations can differ by an entire month! Even the two Tibetan-style calendars covered here, the Tsurphu (Karma Kagyu Lineage) and the Phugpa (Gelugpa Lineage) can, on occasion, differ by one whole month! It can only differ by an exact lunar month because no"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 152 matter which system you use, the Asian year begins on the day following a New Moon. For those of us used to calendars being absolute, this can be very confusing. How can New Year be off by an entire month? Months and Elements Each of the twelve or thirteen Tibetan lunar months is assigned one of the sixty element-animal combinations, such as, for example, a month might be called the “Water-Tiger” month. Here again I must point out that there is not complete agreement among Tibetans as to just how this should be done. In fact, there are several schemes for assigning elements and animals, and the differences are much too complicated to go into here. I suggest anyone who wishes to study these differences see the book “Kalachakra and the Tibetan Calendar” by Edward Henning. One established method of naming the Tibetan months is where the animal for the first month of the year is always the Tiger, and the rest of the months follow in the standard order of the Tibetan animal cycle (Tiger, Hare, Dragon, etc.). As for determining the element that goes with the animal or branch for each month, again there are differences. The Phugpa tradition states that the element that goes with the first month is always the son of the element of the year. For example, using the sexagenary cycle, I was born in 1941, the year of the Iron-Snake, so Iron (metal) is the element for the year 1941, and the son or child or Earth is the element Water. In this method the son of the element of the year is the element of the first month, the son of the element of any month gives the element of the first day of the month,"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 153 and the son of the element of that first day gives the element of the first double-hour. Each element holds for two months, and the order of the element is in the standard order: iron (metal), water, wood, fire, and earth. To recap: the son of the element of the year is the element of the first two months (Tiger and Hare). Then, the son of the element used in the first two months becomes the element used in the third and fourth months, and the son of that element (third and fourth months) becomes the element for the fifth and sixth month, and so on for the rest of the year. However, according to Edward Henning, the above-described method is not that much used in almanacs. What is used is the following method, based on the animal-gender combination (the stem) for the current year. Year Stem First Month Element Wood (male) Fire-Tiger (male) Earth (female) Fire-Tiger (male) Wood (Female) Earth-Tiger (male) Iron (male) Earth-Tiger (male) Fire (male) Iron-Tiger (male) Iron (female) Iron-Tiger (male) Earth (male) Wood-Tiger (male) Water (female) Wood-Tiger (male) Fire (female) Water-Tiger (male) Water (male) Water-Tiger (male) For example, I was born in 1941, the year of the Iron-Snake (female), so the animal-element combination for the first lunar month of 1941 would be the Iron-Tiger, and therefore the second month would be Iron-hare."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 154 Remember that the animal signs go in order, one for each month, but the elements are doubled. After these first two, we follow the rule given earlier that the son of the element used in the first two months becomes the element used in the third and fourth months, and so on. For 1941, the third month would be the Water-Dragon, and the fourth the Water-Snake, since Water is the son of Iron. And so it goes. The Lunar Month For starters, as mentioned, it is important to understand that Tibetan astrology is lunar based (the Moon), rather than solar based like the calendar we are used to here in the West. What is of interest to Tibetans is the lunar month, which is (on average) 29.5 days in length. The lunar month is based on the solunar angle, which is the ever increasing (or decreasing) angle between the Sun and the Moon, as the Moon makes its monthly journey around the earth from New Moon to the next New Moon. Tibetans divide the 360-dgree lunar cycle into 30 days, each day lasting for the time it takes for the solunar angle to increase by 12 degrees of arc. Because the Moon moves in an ellipse (going faster or slower at different parts of its orbit), some lunar days take less time to cover those 12 degrees, while others take more. They do not measure an even 24 hours, like conventional clock time. This varying speed of the Moon allows for the double and omitted lunar days in the Tibetan almanac or calendar."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 155 The Phases of the Moon The phases of the Moon have been observed for ages. The Moon, from a Sanskrit term for measure, is still the primary means by which the majority of the people in the world (even in this 21st century!) measure time and the events in their own lives. I am referring here to the Asian countries, where astrology is an accepted part of society. Although measuring time and life by the Moon is ancient, it is not just some primitive sort of clock. The very sophisticated concept of lunar gaps springs from centuries of painstaking psychological observation by the lamas of Tibet and the Hindu sages. They practice it today with the same vigor and intensity as they did a thousand years ago. Unlike many other traditions, where the line of successors (lineage) has been broken due to various events, the dharma and astrological tradition of Tibet remains pure and unbroken to this day. Although much of the Tibetan dharma tradition requires dedication and intense practice, learning to use the Moon's phases and the concept of lunar gaps is easy to get into. The theory is simple. It involves the ongoing relationship between the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth – the monthly cycle of the phases of the Moon. We already know about the Moon cycle, and can even walk outside at night and see which lunar phase we are in. We are always in the middle of the lunar cycle. This is not the place (and I am not the expert) to describe to you either the very complicated astronomical motions these three heavenly bodies produce, or the profound theories of what all of this motion means in a"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 156 philosophical sense. What is quite accessible is the concept of lunar gaps. As we know, the Moon cycle goes through its phases from New Moon to Full Moon, back to New Moon in a cycle of about one month, some 30 days. This is seen as an ongoing cycle of activity – endless in extent. It goes on forever. However, although the Moon cycle is unending, it does have distinct phases, such as the Full Moon, New Moon, the quarters, and so on. In Tibet and India, the monthly lunar cycle is divided into 30 parts called lunar days. There are thirty lunar days (cumulative 12-degree angular separations of the Sun and Moon) starting from the New Moon (considered the 1st day), counting through the waxing half of the Moon cycle to the Full Moon (start of the 16th day) and on around through the waning cycle, back to the New Moon again. What is interesting about the Tibetan view of this 30-day cycle is that the 30 lunar days are not considered all of equal importance. Here in the West, we note difference between New Moon and Full Moon, at least some folks do, but not much else. To the Tibetans, the monthly lunar cycle has many more event points within it other than those of the Full and New Moons. These lunar gaps or openings that occur in each 30-day moon cycle are opportunities waiting to be observed and perhaps taken advantage of. It is at these lunar gaps or openings in this endless cycle that it is often possible get a glimpse or some insight into various areas of our own life or to have certain kinds of experiences. In fact, the Tibetans take full advantage of these very regular lunar gaps to perform very specific practices. In other words: certain lunar days have proven themselves to be auspicious for"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 157 particular kinds of activities and others perhaps should be avoided. In the East, they speak of mental obscurations that tend to cloud our minds, but that can sometimes clear up, just as the Sun comes out from behind the clouds. These moments of clarity are the gaps in the clouds. From a reading of the Eastern literature on this subject, one gets the sense that (in general) life is perceived as being filled with the noise of our own problems (obscurations), making clear insight often difficult for us. These obscurations can be many and their accumulation amounts to the sum total of our ignorance – that which we at present ignore. Therefore, in Eastern countries, these articulation points or lunar gaps (windows in time/space) are very much to be valued. They amount to opportunities for change. In fact, the Eastern approach is to analyze the lunar cycle in minute detail in order to isolate these moments (gaps in time/space) where insight into our larger life situation can be gained. Much of the day-to-day practice in Eastern religions amounts to a scheduling of precise times for personal practice or activity around the natural cycle of the moon – lunar days. In its own way, this is a very scientific approach. In the East, they have been astute observers of the mind for many centuries. Here in the West, we are no stranger to clear days in our mind. We have those too! The only difference is that we tend to believe that these so-called clear days appear randomly – every now and then. The more sophisticated (and ancient) psychological analysis of the East has found that these clear days are (for the most part) anything but random events. They have their own internal ordering, and often times this ordering can be associated with the phases of the Moon."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 158 In summary, there are times each month when it is more auspicious or appropriate to perform or be involved in one kind (or another) of activity. There come gaps in the general obscuration or cloudiness of our mind when we can see through the clouds – when penetrating insight into our own life is possible. Most of us could benefit from that insight. I know I need it. As noted, the times when one can see without obscuration (see clearly) are very much valued in the Tibetan dharma tradition. These are viewed as real opportunities for insight and the subsequent development such insight generates. Knowing when and where to look for these insight gaps has been the subject of study and research in Tibet and Asia for centuries. Before studying Tibetan astrology, I didn’t even understand these lunar gaps existed. It gives a whole new meaning to the British phrase “Mind the gap.” And this is not just academic research. Lunar gaps are used to plan a wide variety of events in the Tibetan calendar, everything from finding a time to perform a simple healing ceremony to full scale life empowerments. Aside from knowing when these lunar gaps can be experienced, the other major thing to know about this subject is what to do when the gaps occur. As you might imagine, there are a wide range of practices, depending on the particular lunar gap (phase) and the personal needs of the practitioner. However, in general, these lunar gaps are times to be set aside for special observation. Tibetans observe these days with great attention and care. In fact, in many Eastern countries they don't have Saturday and Sunday off. Instead, New and Full Moon days are"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 159 considered holy days (holidays), and normal routines are suspended at these times. These are days that are set aside for observation of our own mind. In the Western tradition, holidays are observed, but not astronomical moments. This word \"observation\" is worth mentioning, for this is what takes place at these times. In the West, we might use the catch-all word meditation. In Tibet there are many words that come under the general concept of meditation. The word \"observe\" is a lot closer to what happens during these lunar gaps. Observe the nature of the day. Observe your mind at these times. Be alert, present, and set that bit of time aside just to examine yourself, your mind, the time – what-have-you. It is while being present – observing these seed times – that the so-called lunar gap can present itself, that we can glimpse or see through that window in time. Many great dharma teachers have pointed out the existence of gaps in our life, moments when clarity and real insight is possible. And lest we get too far afield, sitting there waiting for a gap in time or space to occur, let me restate: The gap that appears is a gap in our particular set of obscurations, our own personal cloudiness. When such a gap takes place, there can be an intense insight into some particular aspect of our life situation, the effects of which may stay with us for a long time. One moment of real insight or vision can take weeks or months to examine in retrospect. Each time we bring such an insight experience to mind, its richness is such that it continues to be a source of inspiration. This is what lunar gaps are all about. At this point, it is hoped that you have some general idea of what lunar gaps are and how you might go about"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 160 taking advantage of them. It remains to give you a schedule of when they will occur. The solunar angle between the Sun and Moon is the basis for much of Tibetan astrology and the key to measuring the start and end of each of the 30 lunar days. The Tibetan month begins at the moment New Moon, which is the start of the 1st lunar day. When the angle between the Sun and the Moon reaches 12 degrees, it is the start of the 2nd lunar day and so on. Each successive 12-degree arc of angular separation marks succeeding lunar days...on to the end of the 30th day, which is the next New Moon. However, the celebration or listing of the event may occur on the following day. One source of possible confusion to keep in mind (mentioned earlier in this text) is that Tibetan practice calendars are geared for group practice, which means that if the moment of the New Moon is at 2 A.M., the group will most likely be asleep and not able to gather. For convenience purposes, the lunar day of the month at sunrise (about 5 A.M.) is usually listed as the lunar day for that calendar date, even if the beginning of it occurred many hours earlier on the preceding day. For example, Losar, the Tibetan New Year is celebrated on the day following the day on which the actual New Moon occurs. In contrast, the Chinese celebrate the New Year on the actual calendar date on which the New Moon occurs. The point here is that most Tibetan almanac or calendars are geared for group practice. Here in the West, many solitary practitioners keep to the lunar calendar and observe the time when the actual lunar day changes. "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 161 Below you will find a list of the major lunar days in the Tibetan practice calendar and what they are about. There are still further divisions that we have not included here, to keep this simple. These are the days observed by most Tibetan lamas in one form or another. These lunar opportunities are sometimes referred to as gaps or openings in the otherwise continuous stream of our lives – windows in time. The Tibetans conceive of these gaps as articulation points, much like an elbow is where the arm is articulated. They are natural joints or gaps in time/space upon which time and space turn and through which it is sometimes possible to gain access to information about the larger, dynamic life process that already encapsulates us. In other words, we can see beyond our personal obscurations at these times. The idea here is that we are each in the midst of our lives, surrounded by the cloud of our own personal obscurations. As one Tibetan rinpoche put it to me: those of us living today are the ones who through all this time have never managed to get enlightened, the hard cases. Surrounding us, but ignored by us until now, are all the hints, teachings, suggestions, pointers, etc. on how to clear up our mind and become more enlightened. We have managed to ignore almost every opportunity for insight. Therefore, the fact that these lunar gaps or openings exist should be welcome news to us, opportunities for us to see more deeply into our condition and get a better handle on things. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 162 Major Practice Days Let’s go over briefly some of the more important lunar days that are observed to give some idea as to the kind of practices performed on those days. Dharma Protector Days Both East and West lunar traditions agree that the two or three days preceding the moment of the New Moon can be difficult ones, days which require special observation and care. In the West these days have been called the dark of the Moon, or devil's days – days when the so-called darker forces are said to have power. Both traditions affirm that we sort of survive these final three days each month. We wait them out. Check it out for yourself. The three days before New Moon can be a hard time.

In particular, the 29th day (the day before New Moon) is called Dharma Protector Day. It is a time given over to purification and preparation for the moment of New Moon. Ritual fasting, confession of errors, and the like are common practices. Purification Days In a similar vein, the days just prior to the Full Moon (the 13th and 14th) are also days of purification, days in which the various guardian and protector deities are again invoked, but in a somewhat more restrained way. For example, the 14th day is often given over to fire puja – a ritual purification. In summary, during days prior to Full and New Moons, there is usually some attempt at purification, both physical and mental, in preparation for those auspicious events."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 164 The Full and New Moons It is clear from the Tibetan literature that the times of the New and Full Moon are considered of great importance. In fact, these days are set aside for special rituals and worship. As pointed out, Full and New Moon (Full more than New) are times of collective worship and public confession. In many traditions, the monks and priests assemble for a day of special observance. In the East, the Full Moon celebration and the entire waxing lunar fortnight are oriented to the masculine element in consciousness, what are called the Father-Line Deities. The New Moon and the waning fortnight are given over to the Mother-Line Deities and the feminine element. The Full Moon completes the masculine, or active, waxing phase of the cycle, and the New Moon completes the feminine, waning phase of the month. To my knowledge, this kind of analysis does not exist in the West to any real extent."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 165 It is quite clear from the Eastern teachings that the moments of Full and New Moon are times when the various channels in the psycho-physical body are somehow aligned. This is not to say the New or Full Moon days are days of peace and quiet. It is taught in the East that, although a New or Full Moon day may tend to be wild or hectic, any patience or forbearance we can muster at that time will be much rewarded. In other words, there can be deep insights available to us at these times. That is why they are set aside for observation; they are observed."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 166 Solar and Lunar Eclipses According to these same teachings, an eclipse at the Full or New Moon is even more auspicious. In the teachings it is said that during these very special events that the winds and the drops, both male and female energies (the inner channels), are in simultaneous alignment – the ultimate opportunity for observation. As you can gather, the lunar cycle and its effects and opportunities have been analyzed in great detail in the Eastern teaching."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 167 Tsok: Feast Days Aside from the New and Full Moons, the two most auspicious lunar days in the East are the 10th and the 25th lunar days. The 10th day (120° of angular separation), called Daka Day, is considered auspicious for invoking the Father-Line Deities – the masculine. The 25th day (300° of angular separation), called Dakini Day, is given over to the feminine principle and the Mother-Line Deities, in general. These two days, the 10th and the 25th, are formal feast days, days of observation when extra offerings are made and increased attention is given to what is happening. There is some sense of celebration at these points in the month, thus the feast or Tsok. In many respects, these two days even rival the New and Full Moon days in importance. The fact is that these four days (New, Full, 10th, 25th) are the primary auspicious days as practiced in many Eastern rituals. They are observed religiously."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 168 Healing Days There are many other days of lesser importance which might also interest Western astrologers. Health and healing are important in Eastern ritual, and the 8th and 23rd days of the lunar month are auspicious for this purpose. It is these days that straddle the first and last lunar quarters. The 8th day (96° of separation) is often called Medicine Buddha Day. Again this occurs in the male, or father-line, half of the month. The 23rd day (276° of separation), occurring in the feminine half of the month, is dedicated to Tara practice. Tara is the female deity connected to health, long life, and healing in general."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 169 More Protector Days Earlier we mentioned the days given over to purification, are most prominently the 13th and the 29th. In addition, on a lesser scale, the 9th and the 19th days are also noted as days when the protector deities should be invoked and kept in mind. These, too, are days of purification. And there are more, still finer, subdivisions that are made. This brief overview should give you a general idea of how the monthly lunar cycle is broken up into days during which certain kinds of activities or observances are appropriate.

A Karana is one half a lunar day (tithi) or six degrees of solunar angular separation. Keep in mind that a lunar day is the time it takes the Moon to travel (in relation to the Sun) 12 degrees of arc. There are thirty lunar days in a month and thus sixty Karanas. There are eleven types of Karana, four of them occur just once a month and are called the Fixed Karanas: Kintughna, Chatushpada, Sakuni, and Naga. The other seven are movable and follow one another in strict rotation: Bava, Balava, Kaulava, Taitila, Gara, Vanija, Vishti Each of the Karanas is said to have a particular influence and interpretation, with “Vishti” being the most inauspicious of the group. Nothing of importance is done during the half lunar day of Vishti. In the Tibetan almanacs the Karana is usually listed for each day as it exists at sunrise, about 5 A.M. of the current calendar day.

The Moon moves through the 360 degrees of the zodiac in the course of one month and spends about one day in each of the Nakshatras. A Nakshatra is simply the familiar zodiac divided into 27 parts, each 13-degrees 20-minutes of angular arc. We all know that the zodiac most familiar to us is divided into 12 sections, one for each month the Sun spends in that sign. With the Nakshatras, the zodiac is divided into 27 sections and it is the Moon that we watch move through these areas of the sky. We could say that the Nakshatra you were born in is another kind of Moon sign. The Nakshatras are ancient and are used by virtually all Vedic/Hindu astrologers in many different ways. The Nakshatra in which you were born is an important key to your character. The lunar mansion or Nakshatra is typically calculated at daybreak (about 5 A.M.). Whichever Nakshatra the Moon is in a daybreak is considered the one to use for that day. However, it is also important to note when (during that 24-hour day) the Moon moves into the next subsequent Nakshatra. That Nakshatra and the time it is entered are usually listed in most Tibetan calendars. Each lunar mansion has its own flavor and interpretation, just as the familiar zodiac signs have their meaning. In Tibet, the tropical zodiac is used to measure the lunar mansions or Nakshatras."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 257 The 27 Nakshatras or Lunar Mansions Tibetan Sanskrit  Element 00 Ta-Kar Asvini Wind 01 Bhya-Nnye Bharani Fire 02 Min-Druk Krittika Fire 03 Nar-Ma Rohini Earth 04 Go Mrgasira Wind 05 Lak Ardra Water 06 Nap-So Punarvasti Wind 07 Gyal Pusya Fire 08 Kak Aslesa Water 09 Chu Magha Fire 10 Dre Purva-Phalguni Fire 11 Wo Uttar-Phalguni Wind 12 Me-Shi Hasta Wind 13 Nak-Pa Chitta Wind 14 Sa-Ri Svati Wind 15 Sa-Ka Visakha Wind 16 La-Tsem Anuradha Earth 17 Nron Jy estha Earth 18 Noop Mula Water 19 Chu-Do Purva Ash adha Water 20 Chu-Me Uttar Ash adha Earth 21 Dro-Shin Shravana Earth 22 Non-Dre Dhanistha Water 23 Non-Dru Shatabhisa Earth 24 Drum-To Purva Bhadrapada Fire 25 Dru-Me Uttara-Bhadrapada Water 26 Namdru Revati Water "},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 258 Nakshatra 00: Healing The Healer.

Their interrelationship creates the eight trigrams, any two of which can be used to form the six-lined hexagram, found in the I-Ching. The active yang force is symbolized by an unbroken line, while the passive yin force is a 2-section broken line. These are then placed, one above the other to form the eight possible combinations or 3-lined trigrams.

In Tibet there is constant reference to the Three Times (past, present, and future) and the Ten Directions. The ten Directions were, of course, East, South, West, North, and the four intermediate directions S.E., S.W., N.W., and N.E. To these were added the directions above and below. Perhaps the center or non-direction should be added to this, to give 11 directions! In ancient China, and it is also true today, the future is said to always come to us from one of these directions, so the pairing of the five elements with the four compass directions (and center) took place very early on in history. We either get up and go in a particular direction, or something appears from a direction, coming our way."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 365 Certain directions were favored, like the southern direction, since (at least in the Northern Hemisphere) that was the direction from which the most light and warmth came – the direction of the Sun each day. The South - Element Fire The direction of the Sun appears always to make a large arc through the sky each day toward the South. The Sun's rays come from the South and cast shadows toward the North. Since the Sun is where all warmth, light, and life comes from, that direction has always had a special importance. It is obvious that the Sun reaches its maximum heat and strength in the summer, so summertime became associated with heat, brightness, the color Red, and, of course, Fire. The Fire Element is associated with the direction South."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 366 The North - Element Water If South represents summer, heat, and dryness, then north (its opposite) represents winter, cold, and wetness. The North corresponds to the element Water and its traditional color is black (darkness) or a deep blue (indigo). If the front door and windows of houses in the Northern Hemisphere all tend to point to the south, then the north side of homes tend to be closed and windowless. Literally, the north side of a house never sees the rays of the Sun, but is always shrouded in shadow. If the South is welcomed, then the North is to be avoided. If the South brings the harvest and plenty, then the North points to mean times and death."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 367 The East - Element Wood The direction East is where the Sun rises, where morning comes, and where things revive and start moving for the day. In most cultures the direction East is considered a very auspicious direction. For one, East is associated with spring and the return of life and green to the world once again. Everything is revitalized and grows, takes fresh form, and has new renewed life, after the harshness of winter. Spring is associated with the Wood Element and, naturally enough, with the color green."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 368 The West - Element Metal The West is where the Sun sets, where day ends, and night comes forth. If East is associated with springtime, then West is associated with autumn, with the gathering of the harvest and the preparing for winter – husbanding things inside. In the Eastern culture, the direction West is associated with death and dying, and burial. Amitabha, the Buddha of the West direction, oversees the setting sun, death and burial – preparing us to transition to the bardo or intermediate states. Unlike here in the West, where the color of death is always black and we dress in black for funerals, in China the traditional color of death is white, and white cloth indicates the dead and funerals.

The Combination Yogas are usually numbered from “0” to “26,” although they are sometimes referenced from”1” to “27.” The Tibetan combination or yoga is arrived at by the simple addition of the Sun and Moon (Tropical zodiac), with no additional sum added to that result. Using a modulus of 27, the combined sum of the Sun and Moon is reduced to a number from 0 to 26, which amounts to dividing the zodiac into equal 27 13-degree 20’ segments. Modern astrologers may want to use the exact positions of the Sun and Moon at birth, but Tibetans tend to be more concerned with determining the Yoga for a particular day, having group practice in mind. Usually the longitude of the Moon is calculated for daybreak, but the longitude of the Sun is frequently used for the time during the previous lunar day (tithi) ended. In other words, there can be at times a considerable discrepancy between the time that the longitudes for the Sun and Moon were calculated. Modern students of Tibetan astrology are trying to sort things out. I prefer to know the instantaneous position of the Sun and Moon – which yoga is right now.

I must admit that it was somewhat disheartening when I sat down one day and did all the calculations and then integrated them into a single list of “bad” years. There were very, very few good years left. But that is the way it is. Below are a number of the most well-known of the so called “portents.” Chief among them is Lo-Khak, the most important of the critical year warnings, Dun-Zur is second and so on, in order of difficulty. Lo-Khak Every 12th year, whenever the animal sign for the current year is the same as your birth year, is considered Lo-Khak - inauspicious. This is the most feared of the inauspicious-years techniques. You might expect that a year which has the same sign as your birth year would be lucky or auspicious. Not in the Tibetan system. If your birth sign and the current year sign are the same (every 12 years) then this, as mentioned, is an example of LO-KHAK, which is very inauspicious. For men, the year before a LO-KHAK (termed NANG-KHAK) is a little more difficult than the LO-KHAK itself, for women, it is the year after LO-KHAK (termed CHI-KHAK) that is difficult."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 411 Lo-Khak Years 12 to 13 years age 24 to 25 years of age 36 to 37 years of age 48 to 49 years of age 60 to 61 years of age 72 to 73 years of age 84 to 85 years of age 96 to 97 years of age During a Lo-Khak year, there are reputedly six months of particular danger when you are most vulnerable : Bird Month 2nd half very bad Dog Month 1st half very bad Pig Month Passable Mouse Month 2nd half very bad Ox Month 1st half very bad Tiger Month Passable Hare Month 2nd half very bad Dragon Month Entire month very bad Snake month 1st half very bad Horse month Passable Sheep Month 2nd half very bad Monkey Month Entire month very bad Bird Month 1st half very bad If the current year sign is the 7th or opposite of the birth sign, this is called Dun-Zur and is also bad.

(2) Then combine that element with the animal sign Tiger (for men) or Monkey (for women) to form one of the sexagenary pairs, and element and animal combination.

Count through the sexagenary pairs until you reach the current age and stop. (4) The animal of the pair where you stopped is your current Log-Men. If the current Log-Men is the animal sign Dog, this is called Nam-Go, the \"Sky Door.\" If it is the animal sign of the \"Pig,\" it is Sa-Go, the \"Earth Door.\" On \"Sky Door\" years, one must be careful of high places, while on \"Earth Door\" years, one must be careful of underground places.

The subject is also covered in considerable detail in Gurme Dorje’s \"Tibetan Elemental Divination Paintings” and Edward Henning’s book “Kalachakra and the Tibetan Calendar.” I refer you to those works for more complete details. The concept of Tomb Signs is something almost unique to Asian astrology, but it does have a distant cousin in Western astrology. First, let's understand it. To understand it, we need to know that the twelve Asian animal signs (like the Western zodiac signs, in this respect) have a traditional order in which they are displayed, based on the compass directions and the five elements. They form a cycle or circle."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 417 The element \"Wood\" (or air) is always shown on the left (toward the East), the element \"Iron\" on the right (toward the West), the element \"Fire\" at the top (to the South), and the element \"Water\" at the bottom (to the North). That takes care of four of the elements, leaving only the element \"Earth\" to place. The element \"Earth\" is placed not in a single spot. It is considered to be placed in the center (we all stand on earth), but also on all four corners of the wheel, what are called on the compass, the intermediate directions: S.E., S.W., N.E., and N.W. In Western astrology, these would be the 45-degree angles or \"Semisquares,\" if we were considering aspects. On the Tibetan wheel of the animal signs, these are called the “Four Tomb Signs,” and are considered inauspicious. They are called Tomb Signs because they are of the \"Earth\" element and because our bodies are eventually buried in the earth. The similarity with Western astrology, as pointed out, is that the tomb signs and the Semisquares are both 45-degree angles, which to many astrologers (including this one) are more \"Square\" than the 90-degree squares, when it comes to interpretation."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 418 Each of the 12 animal signs has an associated element and direction.

There are different methods of examining the tomb signs and the years in an individual's life which they affect. I will list some of them, but I refer you to Edward Henning’s book “Kalachakra and the Tibetan Calendar” for complete details. I also have programmed them in my software for the PC, “Tibetan Astrology.” The Eight Trigrams This is a method of progressing the trigrams, and there is a different method for men and women. The technique is based on determining the trigram that is associated with the corresponding tomb sign. (1) Starting with the birth year, use the trigram Li for men, and the trigram Kham for women. (2) Determine the Life Element for the year of birth. The table for this is located elsewhere in this book."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 419 (3) Given the Life Element for the birth year, use this table: Life Element KEY Tomb Sign Iron KEY Trigram Gin Tomb Sign of Ox Water KEY Trigram Zon Tomb Sign of Dragon Wood KEY Trigram Khon Tomb Sign of Sheep Fire KEY Trigram Khen Tomb Sign of Dog Earth KEY Trigram Zon Tomb Sign of Dragon (4) Count from the birth year as “Li” for men and “Kham” for women.

The net result is that these years marked are considered inauspicious. Method: (1) Note your natal Mewa, the Mewa for the year you were born. (2) Look up the years after the birth when the same Mewa number occurs that was present at birth. These are considered inauspicious.

The starting point depends on the animal sign for the year of birth, and then counting continues until the tomb sign for the natal power element is reached, which amounts to the age of nine for each of us. To do this calculation, you will need a list of the sexagenary Element-Animal cycle, the 60 combinations, which can be found elsewhere in this book. (1) First note the Animal for the year you were born. In my case, 1941 (Iron-Snake), my animal is the Snake. (2) Next, locate your birth Animal in the following table: Animal: Mouse, Pig, Ox, Dragon, Sheep, Dog: KEY: Start with the Wood-Mouse year. Animal: Tiger, Hare: KEY: Start with the Fire-Hare year. Animal: Horse, Snake: KEY: Start with the Iron-Horse year. Animal: Bird, Monkey KEY: Start with the Water-Bird year. (3) In the sexagenary list of element-animal combinations (60-year cycle), go to the KEY Element-Animal combination as derived in step #2, and begin to count BACKWARD, making sure to count the Key Element-Animal combination as #1. (4) Count BACKWARD to the ninth pair, which will be the tomb sign for the natal Power Element.

In this case, the first of the twelve numbers will be the element-animal pair following the result of step #5.

From the very beginning these five elements were not seen as static states, but were considered phases or stages in the ongoing cyclic process of life. They were said to produce one another, to exhaust one phase and turn into the next. This is what is called the Production Sequence of the five elements, and it takes the order of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water, each changing into the next as follows: Wood burning produces... Fire, which in the end leaves ... Earth, as ashes, from which we derive... Metal, which can be melted down to flow like ... Water, which nourishes ... Wood, and so on."},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 508 The Destruction Sequence At the other extreme is what is called the Destruction Cycle. For each element, there is one other element which is particularly adversarial, and \"enemy,\" so to speak. The Destruction Cycle or sequence is: Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, and Metal, and is often explained: Wood absorbs or eats... Earth, which drinks up and removes... Water, which puts out ... Fire, which melts ... Metal, which cuts up... Wood, etc. In fact, in terms of explanation, the destruction sequence makes more immediate sense than does the production sequence. In comparison to the production sequence, the destruction cycle is simply every other element, in strict rotational order."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 509 In the production cycle, the element that produces the second element is said to be the \"mother\" of that element, and the element that is produced is said to be the \"child\" of the mother element. Therefore, the mother element in every combination is considered very important to the health and welfare of the child element. The child element looks to the mother for nourishment and support, just as a human child depends on its mother. It should not surprise us to learn that when any element is attacked or threatened by the destruction or adversarial element, increasing the strength of the mother element of that element under attack will strengthen and protect it. In fact, as you will soon learn, each of the five elements has a direct and identifiable relationship with each of the other four. From this stems much of the familiar feng-shui remedies, which consist of strengthening or weakening the various elements in order to arrive at a functioning harmony of the elements. When all is said and done, many of the techniques used for elements have to do with examining the elements relating to the various compass directions, determining their strength or weakness, and adjusting or weakening the strength of one element or another."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 510 The Production Cycle Sometimes there is a need to enhance or make an element stronger, to somehow make or produce more of that element, and this is called the Production Cycle. The Production Cycle reveals which element is the mother (or producer) of any given element, and this is what is called the Production Cycle, one element is the mother of or produces another. Here is that cycle: Wood produces Fire Fire produces Earth Earth produces Metal Metal produces Water Water produces Wood There are a number of explanations why a particular element is the mother on another, and some seem more logical than others. One of the more popular ones goes like this:"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 511 Burning Wood produces Fire Fire produces ash or Earth Earth contains ore and therefore produces Metal Metal, when cold, produces Water on its surface Water produces Wood or plants There are several variations on how the production cycle of the Five Elements may be derived. While these might be helpful aids to memorize the sequence, they (or parts of them) require stretches of credulity that I find hard to make. Easier to handle is declaring that these five elements are linked together in a cycle. Once that is known, then the phases of any cycle have to be similar, like the cycle of the breath or the heartbeat - expansion and contraction, and on around. This cyclic sequence places Wood at the direction East, Fire toward the South, Metal toward the West, and Water to the North. The element Earth is placed in the center of the diagram."},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 512 The Destruction Cycle On the other hand, sometimes an element is just too strong, overbearing, or too dominant. It needs to be removed, and thus the Destruction Cycle. For each element there is a nemesis or anti-element that will destroy it and cause it to go into decline. Here is the list. Water destroys Fire Fire destroys Metal Metal destroys Wood Wood destroys Earth Earth destroys Water"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 513 The Reduction Cycle Sometimes you don't want to out-and-out destroy an element, but just weaken or deemphasize that element. Each element has another element that reduces or weakens that element. This is called the Reduction Cycle, and it is the exact opposite of the Production Cycle. This cycle is also called the Control Cycle, because any element can be controlled (reduced) through invoking a second element. For example, in the production cycle we know that Water produces (is the mother of) Wood. In the reduction cycle, therefore, Wood weakens Water, by the fact that it drains it in order to make the Wood grow stronger. For every element there is another element that drains or reduces it. Here is the list: "},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 514 Earth reduces Fire Fire reduces Wood Wood reduces Water Water reduces Metal Metal reduces Earth"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 515 The Masking Cycle The Masking Cycle, which is the same as the Production Cycle, is not as frequently mentioned as the other cycles, and has to do with supporting or propping up an element that, for one reason or another, is being destroyed or harmed. Using the Masking Cycle, we apply an element to shore up or support the element being destroyed or harmed. The Masking Cycle is: Wood produces Fire Fire produces Earth Earth produces Metal Metal produces Water Water produces Wood"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 516 Two Diagrams So there are two major diagrams that are used to illustrate the sequence of the five elements and, unfortunately, each has flaws. In the one on the left, we see the production sequence clearly, but there is no convenient way to line up five elements with the four seasons, the four directions, and so forth. With the diagram at the top left, we see how four of the elements line up with the four directions and four seasons, but the Earth element is out of sequence. It is in the center. The diagram at the lower right shows how the Chinese tradition integrates the Earth element into a five-seasonal approach.

Although they have many similarities, they are not the same."},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 523 Natural Elements And let's not confuse the Chinese/Tibetan Element \"Fire\" with the fire in a campfire or the element \"Earth\" with simple soil, although there is obviously some correspondence. In the chemist's Periodic Table of Elements, elements refer to physical states like iron, nickel, copper, and so on. The Greeks and others refer to elements as static qualities that make up our universe - things or states. The earth is made up of these elements. The astrological elements Fire, Air, Earth, and Water are also states or qualities."},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 524 Process and State The Chinese elements are not so much \"things\" or states as they are simultaneously both processes and states. In other words, think of the Chinese/Tibetan Five Elements as active and always in motion – pure energy in flux. These five elements mark the kind of changes going on around us all the time, rather than something permanently there and static. It may be more helpful to think of the Five Elements as reminders or pointers as to the phase or kind of change going on around us rather than something in themselves. When we refer to the element Wood, we are pointing to the act of starting forth and initial growth. Wood is not a place or a state, but a state of change or a way something is changing, in this case developing or growing. That is the general idea."},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 525 Process of Change When all is said and done, these five elements are of critical importance to Tibetan Astrology and feng-shui-style analysis as they constitute one of the principal forms through which astrology is used by the lay person and through which feng-shui remedies can be applied. In the cycles of change going on in the life around us, everything is constantly turning into its opposite and back around again – transformation. One thing leads to the next, and then turns into the next, and so on. The Five Elements mark distinct phases or ways of changing in the endless cycles of life."},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 526 Element Remedies Elemental remedies are key to understand, if you want to work with feng-shui. Without grasping the theory of the five elements and how to balance them, most of the modern traditional of feng-shui will remain a mystery to you. So, although this type of theory can at first appear to be difficult to understand, you will be much better off if you just bite the bullet and learn it now. Otherwise, you will close the door on most of what feng-shui remedies are all about. I know this from experience, because I tried to ignore or put it off for a long time, and finally had to return to the beginning and just learn it. It really helps."},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 527 Remedies – Mother and Child The most important elemental relationship may be that of mother and child. In the standard elemental sequence Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water, when considered in a clockwise rotation, the element clockwise to any other element is the child. The element counterclockwise to any other element is the mother. The mother produces the child and is capable of providing or withholding nourishment and strength. In fact, any particular element is positioned between its mother and its child, each of which are capable of affecting its health and strength. Manipulating the mother and child of an element is a standard way to increase or decrease its strength and power. If an element is too strong and that increased strength is causing problems in the feng-shui analysis, one remedy"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 528 is to simply decrease its strength using either its mother, its child, or both. By removing or decreasing the mother element, you automatically cut of the supply of nourishment to its child, the element that is getting out of hand. On the other hand, by increasing the strength of the child element to the element that is too strong, it automatically demands more nourishment and strength from its mother, and decreases its strength accordingly. So an element can be controlled by increasing or decreasing its mother, its child, or both."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 529 Destroying Element An even more aggressive approach to toning down an unruly element is to invoke the element that destroys it. For each element, there is one other element that is its destroyer. Looking at the standard production sequence for any element, its destroyer element is always that element that is two elements back, that is the third element counterclockwise to the element you are considering, given that the element you are seeking to control is the first element. This destroying element is also called the Grandparent of the element that needs to be controlled, in other words: the parent of the parent of the element you are looking at. This is the destroyer. By increasing the strength of the destroyer element, you automatically decrease the strength of the element you wish to control. This is about as aggressive a measure of control as you can leverage."},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 530 Of course, in many or even most cases, you don't need to go to the extreme of invoking the destroyer element. Often just backing off the strength of the parent or increasing the strength of the child is enough to temper and tone down the element that needs some adjustment. The only other measure that can be undertaken is to increase the strength of the element called the \"grandchild,\" which is the third element forward from the element that needs toning down, counting that element as number one. By increasing the grandchild element, which is automatically under attack from the element you want to tone down, it draws strength away from your element, thus contributing to decreasing its strength."},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 531 Helping an Element The reverse process is also true. Sometimes what is needed is to strengthen an element that is weakened, one that needs a boost. There are several ways to do that, as well. You can increase the strength of its parent, so that it receives more nourishment and protection. You can decrease the strength of its child, so it does not pull so much strength from its mother, the element you are considering. By the same token, you can decrease the strength of its destroying element, so that it does not impinge on your chosen element, and lastly, you can decrease the strength of the grandchild element, so that it takes less strength to attach. You get the idea. The Chinese concept of the Five Elements and feng-shui for that matter is all about balance and harmony. To show what I would consider a perfect example of the difference between Eastern and Western philosophy:"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 532 Looking at the elemental balance from a Western perspective, if you are missing an element, you are said to lack that quality. However, in the Eastern view of the fiv e elements, when you are missing an element, this element is termed your \"Luck Element,\" because only when you add it or come across it can you ever be balanced.

Remember that Wood is the natural enemy of Earth. A common remedy is to increase the strength of Wood's enemy, which as it turns out is the child of Earth, Metal. In fact, the enemy of your enemy will always be your child. In this sense, the child comes to the aid of the parent.

It represents the life strength or elan vital – how you hold your life. Then comes the power element, how you overcome obstacles, and achieve goals. This is of special interest for women. The function of power is spontaneous, instantaneous – you must have it now. Bodily health, physical health or sickness is important for all. The luck element, also called Lung-Tha or \"Wind Horse,\" is special for men, while soul, which is somewhat similar to the life force but more concerned with the emotional or psychological state, is not used very much. The Soul or “La” element is the spirit in the body. It can be dislodged to sickness or shock and become separated from the physical.

Each of these factors already has an established meaning for its various members, and the Tibetans draw on that meaning.

The concept of mind practice is not yet well known here in the West. How many people do you know who consciously practice using their mind for its own sake, anyway? Most of us assume that the mind is quite usable just as we find it, and does not require any special exercise or training. In many Eastern countries, mind practice is not only acknowledged, it is considered an essential part of an education. This is true for countries like Tibet, Nepal, much of India, and parts of China and Japan, where it is understood that the mind, by nature, is unruly and hard to manage. In these cultures it is assumed that little can be accomplished in life without first learning how to use and work with the mind. In short, mental preparation or"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 587 mind practice, as it is called, is an important part of life in most parts of Asia. Why has mind practice as understood in the East never caught on in North America? In part, this may be due to our whole take on the term “meditation,” and what we think that is. Meditation here in the West has come to mean something almost like relaxation therapy, a way to relax and get away from the worries of the world, perhaps in the contemplation of some inner landscape. This approach to meditation, although valid in its own way, shows little resemblance to its Eastern counterpart, which is not primarily concerned with various methods to relax and get rid of tension. The Tibetan or Zen Buddhist concept of meditation or mind practice involves very intense use of the mind. It is unfortunate that here in the West these more active forms of mind practice have been subsumed under the general label of meditation. Having pointed this out, it may be helpful to clarify and describe what it is that Tibetan Buddhists (and other groups) do when they meditate. In general, if you ask what happens on the cushion, the answer is \"practicing\", or \"sitting.\" Indeed, that is what takes place. Physically, we sit. The most striking difference between sitting practice (mind practice) and relaxation/meditation as understood in this country is that Tibetan mind practice is anything but relaxing or passive. It is very active."},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 588 Shamata Meditation This basic form of Buddhist meditation, called shamata, is practiced not only in Tibet, but also by many Eastern countries. Zen Buddhist Zazen meditation is very similar. Shamata is a Sanskrit word meaning peace or calm-abiding, and, although the final result of mind practice is a more peaceful you, the process (at least for beginners) is not exactly what most of us would recognize as peaceful or in any way “fun.” What all forms of shamata share is an emphasis on being present or trying to, just sitting and observing the mind. In this practice, there is no attempt to go anywhere else in the mind other than this present moment. Just sit and observe the mind. Often some object of concentration is selected as the primary focus of attention – home base so to speak. This can be the simple act of breathing itself. Whenever thoughts or distractions occur, and are recognized (day dreaming,"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 589 for instance), this is noted and the mind is gently brought back to the breath – just breathing. Whatever the diversion, the attention is always brought back to the present moment. The distraction is noted, not dwelled on, and the mind returns to the task at hand – sitting. With practice, the mind is trained to be aware of what is happening, without as many excursions or escapes. It might seem that having nothing to do but sit would be easy enough. However, for most of us, it is anything but that. Confronting restlessness and the endless need for entertainment or escape can be both humbling and frustrating. It is hard for us to sit still for even five minutes much less for the longer sessions usually recommended. Another common misconception is that the time we spend in mind practice, sitting or meditating, is itself the purpose or goal of practice, that is: one looks forward to the meditation session as an oasis of reverie in the middle of an otherwise hectic day. For the majority of practitioners, mind practice sessions are far from that – representing some of the more challenging moments in the daily schedule. As mentioned earlier, daily shamata practice seldom results in a more peaceful mind or time out from life, at least in the beginning stages. The results of sitting do not appear at once, sitting there on the cushion, so to speak. Instead, these results show up during the rest of our day in the form of insights and increased awareness as to how to handle whatever comes our way. By learning to calm the mind, it is possible be aware of what happens in the mind."},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 590 In fact, the main result of mind practice is an increased awareness of our own mind and all that goes on in it. With regular sitting practice, we are better able to observe what happens. We begin to catch ourselves being carried away, and can more easily bring our attention back to the task at hand. What we learn on the cushion gradually transfers itself into our daily life. When we begin to catch our distractions in our day-to-day life, the result is an enhanced concentration and ability to handle situations that present themselves. This kind of result is of far greater practical value than a few peaceful minutes in an otherwise frenzied world. In essence, we learn to train our mind just as we train our body for sports or any learned skill. In summary, there are two ideas that have been pointed out here regarding meditation or mind practice as used in the East. First, it is anything but a quick escape, and seldom relaxing in the common sense of that word."},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 591 Rather than a time for reverie, sitting practice is, at first, very hard work. And second, the purpose or result of mind practice is not some relaxed state to be experienced while sitting on the cushion, although this may be the case for advanced practitioners. I wouldn’t know. Instead, beginning mind practice results in perfecting our eventually being able to grasp real-life situations and, in general, awareness of what is happening to us. The result of sitting meditation or mind practice is an enhanced ability to deal with the world around us with awareness and skillful means. It is this increased ability to respond to whatever presents itself that is the sign of successful shamata meditation. We become peaceful because we are able to handle our lives in a more practical manner. Once the mind is calmed, a second stage of mediation practice can begin, which is called Vipassana (Lag-Ton), and this involves increasing awareness of what takes place in the mind, and in particular, the actual nature of the mind itself.

It has been described in various books, but it is worth going to the trouble of getting this instruction from someone who is authorized to give it – who has practiced it. In this way, you are assured of an authentic connection handed down in an unbroken line reaching back at least 1000 years.

In general, the twelve phases are grouped as follows: \"Ignorance\" (ignoring the actual truth) has caused us to create... \"Karma,\" which has resulted in our current state of existence. The next seven phases describe life as we know it: Consciousness, Name & Form, The Six Senses, Contact, Feeling, Craving, and Grasping represent the processes we go through in an endless cycle.

Without his help, this material would not have been possible. Over the forty years or so that I have been studying astrology, I have been particularly interested in whatever relates to the space directly surrounding me, my local area. I developed an astrological technique in the early 1970s that is now used by astrologers all over the world, called “Local Space.” Local Space is primarily used today as a relocation technique, but I always used it for much more than that in counseling. So it should come as no surprise that I am fascinated by the concept in Tibetan astrology of the Sa-Dak, the spirits that surround and protect a particular place and land, the lords of the land – Earth Lords. Particularly, in these times in which so much wide-scale destruction to nature and the land has taken place, one cannot but wonder about the consequences. In general, modern society has adopted as a world view the very materialistic concept that land and sea are just dirt and water, so many atoms, and have in themselves no innate essence or “soul.” But the Tibetans and the Chinese don't feel this way at all. They respect the land and everything about it. This is why Feng Shui is so popular in these countries and much consulted. These Tibetan Earth Lords are similar to Feng Shui, but they have to do not so much with where and how things are positioned, but with the very energy of a place and the respect shown to it – how it is treated. Let me explain:"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 608 According to the Tibetan and the Chinese, every place – that is, every mountain, stream, and canyon – is something more than just the sum of its physical parts and whatever beauty it may or may not possess. There is some kind of force or energy connected to the way things have come together in this spot to make it what it is. In other words, there is such a thing as an energy or indwelling nature spirit – whatever you want to call it. From this point of view, locations are not just atoms of rock and water, but there is some subtle and perhaps indescribable energy that makes a particular valley or forest \"beautiful,\" a place where you can sense of a power or presence that takes our breath away, if only for a moment. We intrinsically sense that some places as special. What makes them special? The Tibetans tell us that these special places (and most places are special to someone) are power places, and that to wantonly destroy or deface them is not without consequences to us. If we mess with these power points, the energy bound there can be unleashed and perhaps react to harm us. Of course, I am tip-toeing around here a bit, trying to describe all of this in as \"scientific\" and abstract a way as possible, while the Tibetan and Chinese just come right out and say that many places are governed and cared for by a variety of spirits who protect them. The Earth Lords protect the land against any form of disrespect or harm. There you have it. So, in considering these Earth Lords, please keep the above in mind. The Earth Lords or Sa-Dak, as they are called in Tibetan (in Sanskrit: bhumipati = Master of the Land) are an important part of geomancy as practiced in Tibetan Buddhism. The Earth Lords are literally that, the lords and spirits of the local space or soil surrounding"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 609 any area, and they need to be consulted and kept in mind when planning anything to do with building, relocation, marriage, health, death, and the like in their area, that is: on their turf. From the Tibetan point of view, we humans don’t “have” turf. We only share the earth at the kindness of the Earth Lords, and they are anything but kind if provoked. The history of Earth Lords goes back to antiquity and they are said to have arisen from the subtle vapor of the Cosmic Turtle, at the very origin of Tibetan astrology. The main text which contains the Earth Lord descriptions is the “Gathering of All Precious Elements.” There are an almost infinite number of Earth Lords, and at least 1000 are said to be defined, of which around 500 are commonly consulted in relations to their activity in the current year, months, days, and hours. Here we will detail a little over 100 Earth Lords, the ones that are said to be always present around us. In general Earth Lords are organized by their various elements, the areas they rule, and their outer, inner, and secret aspects. According to Gyurme Dorje there are 102 lords that are ever-present, plus some 500 that are connected to the years, months, days, and hours. These Earth Lords are said to have various levels of enlightenment, ranging from ignorance on up, and they are said to experience happiness and anger depending upon how they are treated – how the land or space they protect is treated. One group of Earth Lords rule the current year, while others rule the month, day, and hour, with some overlapping. The Earth Lords governing the current year, some 45 of them include the 26 chief ministers, together with their offspring. These are the Earth Lords"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 610 given in the various yearly diagrams. There are, in addition, twelve hidden Earth Lords, and a pair of male and female Sky Dogs. The Earth Lords governing the months number some 124, with almost 80 main ones, and 34 component Earth Lords. Also: another twelve hidden ones. As for the Earth Lords that rule the days, these are some 81, of which we are tracking perhaps 40 or so here. As for the hours, there are about 37 Earth Lords connected to these. As you can see, they are many, not few. How the Tibetan astrologers keep track of them all has to do with four different diagrams, one for the current year, and similar ones for the current month, day, and double hours (Tibetan astrology divides the day into twelve double hours, measured from 11 P.M. of the night before). These diagrams are similar to the standard astrological chart wheel, in that they show twelve or sixteen houses, each representing a specific compass direction, a band 22-30 degrees wide. Actually, what is charted on these diagrams are the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, and west), and the four intermediate (45-degree) directions: N.E., N.W., S.E., and S.W. The Tibetans are very aware of the power of these 45-degree compass directions, and in the cycle of the animal signs or \"branches,\" these four intermediate directions are called the “Tomb Signs,” marking them as having some degree of difficulty. It is important to point out that this quite vast series of Earth Lords, while not openly hostile to mankind (they don't hunt us down!), don't like to be disturbed, and if offended, will in fact create major and minor problems for us. This is where the diagrams are helpful, for they"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 611 show where (in what compass direction or sector) at any time (year, month, day, and hour) the particular lords happen to be positioned. And before we get into details, let me make it very clear that we are talking about Tibetan years here, which are made up of 12 or 13 lunar months, and which start on the Tibetan New Year, which is called Losar. For months (and we are talking about lunar months), we are measuring the time from New Moon to New Moon. For days, we are speaking of from sunrise of one calendar date (or thereabouts) to sunrise of the following calendar date, and for hours, we are using the Tibetan system of 12 double hours, starting from around 5 A.M. day. To sum it up, whatever compass direction contains one of the Earth Lords, these are not a good direction for human beings. In other words, one should avoid whatever direction the Earth Lords are in, and seek out those directions which are empty of them, where they are not. That is the general idea of how to deal with Earth Lords. In fact, in both Tibet and China, one does not ever face the direction where the main Earth Lord(s) are, in particular the king – King “The-Se.” The Chinese call him the \"Grand Duke.\" It is fine to have your back toward him (he will even protect you), but any direct facing or confrontation will anger him and bring consequences. There are many kinds of spirits, not only of the land, but of the water and air. The Earth Lords are mostly connected with fields, agriculture, land, AND houses. They are irritated when they are disturbed by our digging the ground, excavating, cutting down forests,"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 612 and so forth. In the same way, other similar spirits respond to air and water pollution. It is best not to confront or offend the Earth Lords, but in practice this may be very difficult to do. The Tibetans and the Chinese have a wide variety of rites and practices that they use to pacify and heal infractions to the Earth Lords. The tradition of Earth Lords is also very prominent in Chinese Astrology, but there it is called \"Tai Sui,\" or more commonly just the \"Grand Duke,\" and is an integral part of Feng Shui. To \"offend the Grand Duke\" is to have the animal of your birth year (or its opposite animal) the same as the animal for the current year. Here we are talking about the 12-year cycle of animals in the Chinese \"zodiac.\" The Grand Duke is a cycle through the 12 animal signs, one for each year, and has been said to be loosely correlated with the 12-year Jupiter cycle. Not so much is said (in Chinese astrology) about the Grand Duke's retinue, and but it is said that you walk with the Duke or against him. For any given year, the Grand Duke is said to be in one direction or another, and one does not \"confront the Duke\" by walking or travelling in that direction – where he stands. Again, the direction that the Grand Duke for any year is a 30-degree sector of space (directionally) which should not be disturbed. Disturbance includes working or digging in the ground in that direction, also renovation, major repairs, etc. The Chinese put off such work until the following year, when the Grand Duke has shifted to another sector. \"Awakening the Grand Duke\" can result in financial problems or ruin. It even comes down to not working (during your daily work) facing the Duke, the direction he is in. Turn your"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 613 back and work facing the opposite (or some other) direction. Don't face the Tai Sui. This is the Chinese tradition. The great emperor of the Sa-Dak, the spirit that owns this entire planet until such time in the future that it will be destroyed is King The-Se (in Tibetan) and called the “Grand Duke” in Chinese terms. The principle Sad-Dak for America is female. Every country and locality has its own Sa-Dak and there are many kinds and species. It is up to us to get along with the Sa-Dak in our area or suffer the consequences. For example, before any major war or fighting, first the Sa-Dak of the two regions fight one an another, and the result of that fight determines the outcome of the war. One lama (a rinpoche) tells the story of his uncle who was a great practitioner of the Chöd practice. He was so sensitive that he could see the Sa-Dak preparations in Eastern Tibet with the Sa-Dak of China for the great invasion of Tibet by China in 1950. This man actually took part in the great council, listened to the Sa-Dak and even gave advice to the leader of the Tibetan Sa-Dak, a Nagini or female Naga. They discussed how to fight the Chinese, using lightning and other weapons. When the uncle returned to his family, he was in tears and everyone wanted to know what was affecting him."},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 614 Geomantic Layout Geomantic Layout for Years and Days For the Tibetans, the Grand Duke is King The-Se, and his entire retinue includes literally hundreds of Earth Lords. As pointed out earlier, this is handled by astrologers and almanacs by a chart diagram with 12 or 16 sections laid out like a map, with compass directions. In these sections the Earth Lords are positioned, often in groups. The above diagram is the kind used for chart the Earth Lords for the current year and for the current hours. In this chart, as you can see, there are twelve directional"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 615 houses, very similar to our Western horoscope of the twelve houses. Only here, the accent is not the zodiac or ecliptic, but on the particular direction. The familiar eight directions (North, South, East, West, N.E., N.W., S.W., and S.E.) and augmented by dividing the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) each into two parts, one before the cardinal point and one following it. The net result is a 12-house system of directions. Notice that one of the twelve animal signs is placed in the center, in this case the Ox. To calculate the directions of the Earth Lords for any given year, consult the tables at the end of this book for the animal sign for the current year. For example, 2007 is the year of the Dog, so we would place the dog in the center of the wheel and access the tables to see which Earth Lords are in which houses for the year of the Pig."},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 616 The Geomantic Layout for Months and Hours In the case of months and hours, the above chart style is use, in this case divided into sixteen division of directionality.

Otherwise the procedure is the same: look in the tables for months and hours and place the Earth Lords that belong there in the appropriate houses. In the case of the wheels for the months (hours follow the arrangement for years and days), there are no"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 617 empty houses and thus no open passageway as we find in the years and days. Instead, certain of the houses have special markers that say “Open Passageway (00) .“ These are the houses where safe passage is guaranteed. On the reverse side, certain houses are marked “Double Negative (--) ” and these houses should be especially avoided as they are very dangerous. Observing the Houses In summary, some of the houses are empty (or specially marked) and these are the ones recommended for use – safe directions for building or travel. The rest are not safe. In other words, avoid any direction where Earth Lords inhabit the house, and take and use any direction that is open or empty, what is called a \"doorway of opportunity.\" The Earth Lords move through the house wheels, some in clockwise motion and other in counter-clockwise motion and they each arise or appear at different points in time. For example, the most important Earth Lord, King The-Se, the one who controls the current year, arises at the summer solstice and proceeds to move in a counter-clockwise direction. The main group of monthly Earth Lords, 64 Earth Lords of inauspicious nature, all appear on the first day of each month, and so on. All of this gets quite complex, and I refer you to Gyurme Dorje’s excellent book on this subject. The twelve or sixteen houses themselves, whether or not they contain an Earth Lord, also are considered in various aspects, and each direction has its own particular drawbacks in relation to a particular month of the year, just as the astrological houses here in the West have certain qualities."},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 618 With the Earth Lords of the days, those animal signs that are square or 90 degrees from one another are considered “black” days – inauspicious. For example, during the Dragon month, the days of the Sheep and Ox would be considered black days, and so forth for the rest of the signs. The same is true when it comes to hours. When it is a Dragon day, the hours of the Sheep and Ox would be black hours. Practical Uses In Tibet, the Earth Lords are part of what we would call geomancy, one of many forms of divination the Tibetans routinely use to allow the universe to speak to them. Earth Lords are consulted for a variety of purposes, in particular anything having to do with land and its disturbance. This would include building roads, houses, clearing trees, selecting burial sites, and so on. There exists a whole hierarchy of steps that need be considered, including not only the structure, shape, and orientation of any new building, but everything about the land and environment surrounding any building or site. This can include things as subtle as the effect of moonlight, rainfall, the affluence (or lack thereof) of the owner, and so forth. All manner of rituals exist for compensating for problems discovered in the inspection process. As mentioned earlier, what is being sought out are the geographic directions where the Earth Lords are NOT present, that is: humans are to avoid disturbing the Earth Lords in whatever directions they currently inhabit. According to author Gurme Dorje in his wonderful book “Tibetan Elemental Divination Paintings,” the origin of the Sa-Dak or Earth Lords is ancient, stemming from the time that the Bodhisattava Manjushri first emanated the Cosmic Tortoise at Mount Wu-Tai Shan in China. It is"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 619 said that Manjushri cut the cosmic turtle with his “sword of contemplation” and from it the Earth Lords arose. It is said that King The-Se emerged from the crown of the turtle, his minister Tsang-kun emerged from the heart, his astrologer Se-Wa emerged from the right lung, the Queen Mother The-Chim from the left lung, the Queen Hang-ne Hang-Pen emerged from the right arm, the royal bodyguard Se-Shar from the left arm, the kings royal mount Se-Wwa from the right leg, the royal timekeeper Se-Ja from the left leg, the royal treasurer Se-Ji at the tail, the royal dog Hal-Chi from the humours, the serpent-spirit lTo-Phye from the skin, the monthly spirit lords from the forehead, the daily spirit lords from the right hip, and the hourly spirit lords from the left hip. Gyurme Dorje also points out that the a number of lesser spirits emerged from the belly, such as The-se Drum-bu, Druk-Lha from the small intestine, the Dröl-Bé Lha-Nga from the heart , the Nyen Chen from the limbs, and the Sil-Mé Sa-Dak (minor spirit lords from the turtle's minor channels).    This subject is quite complex and those of us learning about Tibetan astrology in the West are only now beginning to get a handle on this fascinating topic. This brief description here is but an attempt to draw attention to the existence of the Earth Lord concept in Tibetan geomancy and to provide a short introduction. In putting this introduction together, I have drawn on two primary sources: The book by Gurme Dorje “Tibetan Elemental Divination Paintings” is very highly recommended, although it too is quite incomplete as regards all the details of the Earth Lords and represents an excerpt from still larger traditional Tibetan sources."},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 620 This book is a reproduction of a 17th century text by Sange Gyatso, a treatise on astrology and divination, known as “The White Beryl.” This work is an 18th century illuminated manuscript that is reproduced, translated, and commented upon by Dr. Gyurme Dorje, a skilled translator and authority on Tibetan culture. I should warn readers that this book weighs in at about 35 pounds and cost $500 or more. It is filled with various methods of Tibetan astrology and geomancy and is highly recommended. My second source is the fine work of Tibetan translator and scholar Edward Henning, which can be seen at his website at WWW.Kalachakra.org. Also very highly recommended is Hennings book “Kalachakra and the Tibetan Calendar (Treasuries of the Buddhist and Indic Sciences),” which is available through Amazon.com and should be available by the time your read this. Edward Henning, as far as I am aware of, is the most important western scholar of Tibetan astrology. He was kind enough to help translate the brief descriptions of the various Earth Lords given in this book and has been very patient in answering my many questions. Well, there you have it. I hope this short introduction has been at the very least helpful. The inclusion of the descriptions of the Earth Lords and the tables for placing them for any given year, month, day, or hour should make it possible for you to calculate any of these charts for yourself.

Each table is organized by the twelve traditional animal signs (Mouse, Ox, Tiger, Hare, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Bird, Dog, and Pig). To used these tables to plot the positions of the Earth Lords for the current year, take the animal for that year. For example, 2007 is the year of the Fire-Pig, so we would look under the “years” section for the table for the Pig. In that table, you will find a list of each of the houses or compass directions, and under each direction a list of the names (can numbers) of the Earth Lords that appear in that direction for the year. The same procedure is used for months, days, and double hours. You need the animal for the particular month, day, or hour. Then select the section for month, day, or hour and proceed to note the list of Earth Lords for time period. If you find this too tedious, I have released a program that does this automatically for the PC. You can read about it at StarTypes.com, where you just follow the links to any of the programs and look up the one on Tibetan Astrology."},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 724 Earth

In general, much of this research may be summed up and is expressed in the combined solunar gravitational force. This unique measure includes both terrestrial and solar gravitational influence in a single indicator, incorporating the effects of the accelerated orbital motion of the Moon and the closeness of the separation-interval at perigee-syzygy, the consequence of a coincident Sun/Moon alignment in celestial latitude or declination, and the perturbed motion of perigee subject to increased solar gravitational force when perigee-syzygy occurs near the time of perihelion. In brief, this is the most accurate single indicator for lunar gravitational forces that we have been able to locate. This tidal force indicator may be helpful in indicating the relative strength of any lunar day from a geophysical point of view. The indicator is listed as a percentage of the force, ranging from zero to 100%, with 100% being the strongest tidal force. There is not room here to include tables of the Tidal-Force factor, but it is available as part of the PC program “Tibetan Astrology,” available on StarTypes.com."},{"pageNumber":848,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 848 References Some material in this book is the result of personal discussions with a number of very distinguished lamas in the Karma Kagyu Lineage, including His Holiness Ogyen Trinley Dorje, the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa, H.E.

Most of the information used to create this program came from four Buddhist practitioners or scholars, each with a wide knowledge. In order of my meeting them, they are: John M. Reynolds A remarkable student of the dharma, Reynolds is as much a yogi as he is a scholar. We met in the early 1980s and Reynolds gave a 2-day seminar on Tibetan Astrology at the Heart Center, here in Big Rapids, Michigan. He provided background information on the history of Tibetan astrology as well as the techniques. In 1978, John Reynolds published a detailed Tibetan astrological calendar, perhaps the first document (in English) of its kind.

With the permission of Khenpo Karthar, Rinpoche, abbot of KTD, I invited Wangchuk to come and reside with us in Big Rapids, Michigan, where he spend over 2 1/2 years. During that time, we worked to translate and understand the basics of Tibetan astrology, both that inherited from India (Kar-Tsi) and that from China (Jung-Tsi). Sange Wangchuk was a rare individual, with a knowledge of not only Tibetan, but also Sanskrit, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Hindi, and several other languages. He also was an expert graphic artist and calligrapher, not to mention his vocal skills in the songs of Milarepa, Tibet's greatest yogi. Wangchuk put on a workshop at our center on Tibetan astrology and worked with me to document the basic elements of their astrology. Dr. Drubgyud Tendar In 1997, at the prompting of the Ven. Dzogchen Ponlop, Rinpoche, We invited Dr. Drubgyud to come to our center for an extended stay. The purpose was to attempt to document the basic algorithms of Tibetan astrology used by the Karma Kagyu Lineage, in particular the Tsurphu tradition initiated by the 3rd Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje. The Tsurphu tradition was in danger of being lost because very few practitioners remain, after the Chinese forced many Tibetans to flee for their lives, when they occupied Tibet.

He went on to interview many dozens of performers. Much of this interviewing took place at the Ann Arbor Blues Festivals, in 1969 and 1970, the first electric blues festivals of any size ever held in North America, and than later at the Ann Arbor Blues & Jazz Festivals. With their extensive knowledge of the blues music, Erlewine and his brother Daniel were asked to play host to the score or so of professional blues musicians and their bands. They were in charge of serving them food and (of course) drink. Michael went on to interview most of the performers in these early festivals, with an audio recorder, and later on with video. The interviewing led to more study and ultimately resulted in Michael founding and developing AMG, the"},{"pageNumber":859,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 859 All-Music Guide, today the largest single database of music reviews and documentation on the planet. Erlewine started from a one-room office, and the reviewers and music aficionados of the time laughed at his attempt to cover all music. But he persisted, and the all-Music Guide appeared as a Gopher Site, before the World Wide Web even existed-a database of popular music for all music lovers. Over the years AMG grew, and the All-Movie Guide and All Game Guide were born, and also flourished. Later, Erlewine would create ClassicPosters.com, devoted to the history and documentation of rock n' roll posters, some 35,000 of them. These guides changed the way music was reviewed and rated. Previous to AMG, review guides like the \"Rolling Stones Record Guide\" were run by a few sophisticated reviewers, and the emphasis was on the expertise of the reviewer, and their point of view. Erlewine insisted on treating all artists equally, and not comparing artist to artist, what can be important, Michael points out, is to find the best music any artist has produced, not if the artist is better or worse than Jimmie Hendrix or Bob Dylan. Erlewine sold AMG in 1996, at which time he had 150 fulltime employees, and 500 free-lance writers. He had edited and published any number of books and CD-ROMs on music and film. During the time he owned and ran AMG, there were no advertisements on the site and nothing for sale. As Erlewine writes, \"All of us deserve to have access to our own popular culture. That is what AMG and ClassicPosters.com are all about.” Today, AMG reviews can be found everywhere across the Internet. Erlewine's music collection is housed in an AMG warehouse, numbering almost 500,000 CDs."},{"pageNumber":860,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 860 Heart Center Meditation Room Michael Erlewine has been active in Buddhism since the 1950s. Here are his own words: “Back in the late 1950s, and early 1960, Buddhism was one of many ideas we stayed up late, smoked cigarettes, drank lots of coffee, and talked about, along with existentialism, poetry, and the like. “It was not until I met the Tibetan lama, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, in 1974 that I understood Buddhism as not just Philosophy, but also as path, a way to get through life. Having been raised Catholic, serving as an altar boy, learning church Latin, and all that, I had not been given any kind of a path, other than the path of faith. I hung onto that faith as long as I could, but it told me very little about how to live and work in this world., “I had been trying to learn the basics of Tibetan Buddhism before I met Trungpa Rinpoche, but the spark that welded all of that together was missing.

I didn’t even understand what I was learning. All that I know was that I was learning about myself. “After that meeting, I begin to understand a lot more of what I had read, but it was almost ten years later that I met my teacher, Khenpo Karthar, Rinpoche, the abbot of Karma Triyana Dharmachakra Monastery, in the mountains above Woodstock, NY. Meeting Rinpoche was life-changing. Heart Center Symbol “It was not long after that we started the Heart Center Meditation Center here in Big Rapids, which is still going today.

Some years ago, Rinpoche surprised my wife and I by telling us we should go to Tibet and meet His Holiness the 17th Karmapa, and that we should go right away, that summer, and I hate to leave the house! That trip, and a second trip that followed some years later, turned out to be pilgrimages that were also life changing. Our center in Big Rapids has a separate building as a shrine room and even a small Stupa; pictures are shown below. I can never repay the kindness that Khenpo Rinpoche and the other rinpoches that I have taken teachings from have shown me."},{"pageNumber":863,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 863 Music Career Michael Erlewine’s career in music started early on, when he dropped out of high school and hitchhiked to Venice West, in Santa Monica, California, in an attempt to catch a ride on the tail end of the Beatnik era. This was 1960, and he was a little late for that, but right on time for the folk music revival that was just beginning to bloom at that time. Like many other people his age, Erlewine traveled from college center to center across the nation: Ann Arbor, Berkeley, Cambridge, and Greenwich Village. There was a well-beaten track on which traveled the young folk musicians of the future. Erlewine, who also played folk guitar, hitchhiked for a stint with a young Bob Dylan, and then more extensively with guitar virtuoso and instrumentalist Perry Lederman. Erlewine helped to put on Dylan’s first concert in Ann Arbor. He hung out with people like Ramblin’ Jack Elliot, Joan Baez, The New Lost City Ramblers, and the County Gentlemen."},{"pageNumber":864,"pageContent":"Tibetan Astrology 864 In 1965, the same year that the Grateful Dead were forming, Michael Erlewine, his brother Daniel, and a few others formed the first new-style band in the Midwest, the Prime Movers Blues Band. Iggy Pop was their drummer, and his stint in the band was how he got the name Iggy. This was the beginning of the hippie era. Michael was the band’s lead singer, and played amplified Chicago-style blues harmonica. He still plays. Erlewine was also the manager of the band, and personally designed and silkscreened the band’s posters, one of which is shown below. The Prime Movers became a seminal band throughout the Midwest, and even traveled as far as the West Coast, where the band spent 1967, the “summer of Love,” playing at all of the famous clubs, for example, opening for Eric Clapton and Cream, at the Fillmore Auditorium. As the 60s wound down, and bands began to break up, Erlewine was still studying the music of American Blacks, in particular blues. Because of their knowledge of blues and the players, Michael and his brother Dan were invited to help host the first major electric blues festival in the United States, the 1969 Ann Arbor Blues Festival. They got to wine and dine the performers, and generally look after them. Michael interviewed (audio and video) most of the players at the first two Ann Arbor Blues Festivals, they included: Big Joe Turner, Luther Allison, Carey Bell, Bobby Bland, Clifton Chenier, James Cotton, Pee Wee Crayton, Arthur Crudup, Jimmy Dawkins, Doctor Ross, Sleepy John Estes, Lowell Fulson, Buddy Guy, John Lee hooker, Howlin’ Wolf, J.B.
