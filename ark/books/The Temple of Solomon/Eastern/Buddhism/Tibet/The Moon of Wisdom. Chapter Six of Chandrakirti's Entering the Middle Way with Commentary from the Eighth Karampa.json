Some five centurieslater, the noble protector Nagarjuna, in his seminal text The FundamentalWisdom of the Middle Way,1summarized these vast teachings of the Bud-dha and used logical reasoning to prove the validity of the Buddha’s words.Entering the Middle Way is the glorious Chandrakirti’s2explanation ofthe meaning of Nagarjuna’s work. Its sixth chapter, which constitutes themajority of the text, has four main sections: an explanation of how in gen-uine reality phenomena do not truly arise; a refutation of the Mind- Only(Sanskrit: Chittamatra) School’s assertion that mind truly exists; a refuta-tion of the true existence of the personal self; and an explanation of the six-teen types of emptiness taught by the Buddha in the TranscendentWisdom sutras.In the course of his treatise, composed in succinct verse form, Chan-drakirti clarifies the ultimate meaning of the Buddha’s Transcendent Wis-dom teachings. The Eighth Karmapa, Mikyö Dorje, one of the mosterudite and prolific scholars of the Karma Kagyü lineage of Tibetan Bud-dhism, elaborates on the meaning of these verses in a commentary that heproclaims to contain the key to gaining the realization achieved by all theenlightened masters of the past, present, and future.Our guru, the pre- eminent Kagyü master Khenpo Tsültrim GyamtsoRinpoche, directed each of us to translate one of the four sections of theverses in Entering the Middle Way’s sixth chapter, along with the key por-tions of Mikyö Dorje’s commentary that explain the verses’ meaning,3andto publish our translations in this book, to which he gave its title. Whenwe were preparing our translations for publication, Rinpoche instructedus to use our own individual translation styles and choice of terms in eachof our sections, so that readers could see how different translators analyze,choose words, and write in different ways. Rinpoche also instructed us toMoon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"include the Tibetan text,4for the benefit of Western students learningTibetan and Tibetan students learning English, and also so that readerscould examine the translation against the original Tibetan text and give ustheir comments and corrections, so that we might be able to improve thetranslation in subsequent editions.Khenpo Rinpoche, who spent the first part of his life studying, medi-tating, and teaching in the caves and monasteries of Tibet, India, andBhutan, has been teaching extensively throughout the world since 1977.5Wherever Rinpoche goes, the consistent focus of his teachings is the Bud-dha’s most profound descriptions of the true nature of reality, which Rin-poche explains are the essential key to transcending confusion andsuffering, and to performing compassionate activity that is of meaningfulbenefit to others. Rinpoche notes that the education that modern peoplereceive gives us an excellent advantage as we approach these profoundteachings; from an early age we have trained in developing the analyticaltools we need to study and understand them. Since these teachings are soimportant and modern students have the ability to put them into practice,Rinpoche says that it is the ideal time for works such as Entering the Mid-dle Way to be translated, published, and studied.Although the teachings on the true nature of reality may seem difficultto understand at first, Rinpoche explains that if students approach themin a series of graduated stages, it is much easier to progress in gaining under-standing and experience. Therefore, Rinpoche’s advice to the readers ofThe Moon of Wisdom is that it would be of great benefit to your under-standing if you read his books The Progressive Stages of Meditation on Empti-ness6and The Sun of Wisdom7before you begin to study this volume.Furthermore, following the tradition of studying the classic texts on pro-found topics, it is beneficial to consult more than just one commentary onthe root text in order to clarify difficult points. Jamgön Mipham’s com-mentary on Entering the Middle Wayis one that Rinpoche has taught fromwidely, and he recommends that you consult its translation, published inIntroduction to the Middle Way,8along with whatever other translations andtranscripts of different teachers’ explanations of the text you can find. We are grateful beyond measure to Khenpo Rinpoche, whose teaching,inspiration, and blessing are what made this book possible.

They should be taught the truth of genuine realitybecause as a result they will gain the qualities that will now be described.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section A 23Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- /A, .J- =- .J- ;A- eJ?- ?- :PR- 2:A- ;R/- +/- :L%- ,, 5%g$- +- 5=- OA3?- ;%- .$- ]%?- /?- $/?- 0<- :I<,,.A/- 0- $+R%- 2<- :I<- 8A%- ~A%- eJ- 2!J/- 0<- LJ.,,29R.- 0- |R3- LJ.- .J- ;A- .$J- 2- L%- (2- +,,:PR- 2- .PR=- 2<- L- KA<- ;R%?- ?- 2}R- LJ.- &A%- ,, 6mR$?- 0:A- L%- (2- ?J3?- .0:- i3?- =- $?- 0<- LJ.,, 7 ! */- 0R- .J- =- .J- 2!/- 0?- .R/- 3A/- 3A- 2*J.- 0<- 3- 9., 2!/- .R/- .J:A- eJ?- ?- :PR-2:A- ;R/- +/- ,3?- &.- :L%- 2<- :I<- <R, ,.J?- /- (R?- 5=- :.A- =- $+J<- fJ.- 0-v<- .J- 3A- *3?- 0:A- (J.- GA- ;R/- +/- :.A- i3?- 2!J/- 0<- LJ.- .J, g$- +- 3A- .$J- 2-3,:- .$- %R%- 2:A- 5=- OA3?- ;%- .$- ]%?- /?- $/?- 0<- :I<- +J, 5=- :(=-IA?- %/- :PR<- *J?- /- !R%- *A.- GA- v- 2- o/- (.- 0:A- KA<, ;%- .A/- 0- $+R%- 2<-:I<- 8A%- !J- 5=- OA3?- GA?- 2.J- :PR<- I<- G%- .2=- /- 9?- ?R$?- :5S- (?- z<-LJ.- 0?- !R%- *A.- GA- v- 2- o/- (.- 0:A- KA<, ;%- ~A%- eJ- 5.- 3J.- 0- 2!J/- 0<- LJ.-.J, !R%- *A.- GA- v- 2- ~A%- eJ?- 9A/- 0?- :5%- o- 2<- LJ.- GA, $8/- IA?- 3- ;A/- 0:A-KA<, ;%- 29R.- 0- |R3- 0<- LJ.- .J, OR- 2?- %/- :PR<- :PR- 8A%- #- .R$- %/- 0<-:I<- =, nJ/- .J?- :1$?- 0- 3- 3*J?- /- $.3?- 0- 3A- ,R2- 0?- !R%- *A.- GA- v- 2-(.- 0:A- KA<, ,;%- ?J3?- .0:- .J:A- .$J- 2- ,3?- &.- :PR- 2- 3- =?- 0- L%- (2- +-21=- 2:A- KA<- ;R%?- ?- }R- 2<- LJ.- &A%- !J, .J<- 3- 2}R?- 0:A- .$J- 2- /A- ?%?- o?-GA- o- :V?- 3- (.- 0<- :L%- 2- &/- 3- ;A/- 0:A-KA<, ;%- mR$?- 0:A- L%- (2-?J3?- .0:- i3?- =- $?- 0<- LJ.- .J, ?J3?- .0:- =?- $8/- 0?- gJ/- :L%- !R/- 24The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 24"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"2.2.1.2.The benefits of explaining emptiness to such individualsAll the good qualities following from that will arise within them.

Therefore, they regard this system ofDharma as a newfound precious treasure, and rely on the following qual-ities in order that it should not diminish:They always practice pure ethics that avoid all forms of nonvirtue. [122]The reason for this is that if as a result of corrupted ethics they take birthin the lower realms, the continuum of their view of emptiness will be cut.They give generously, because even if through proper ethical conductthey take rebirth in the higher realms, if they are poverty stricken, they willhave to put so much effort into obtaining food and other means of liveli-hood that the continuum of their view of emptiness will be cut.They practice immeasurable compassion, because when the view ofemptiness is embraced by compassion, this produces the enlightenmentof the buddhas, and nothing else can do so.They cultivate patience, because anger brings rebirth in the lower realmsand an ugly color to one’s face, and if their anger displeases the noble ones,they will not receive the noble ones’ teachings and the continuum of theirview of emptiness will be cut.[122.13] Furthermore, these bodhisattvas completely dedicate all ofthis virtue so that all wandering beings without exception may be liber-ated in enlightenment. They do this because virtue that is not so dedicatedwill not produce the uninterrupted development of the causes and resultsthat culminate in enlightenment.They also respect the perfect bodhisattvas because no one other thanthe bodhisattvas can explain dependent arising.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section A 25Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"3A- /?- 0:A- KA<,$*A?- 0- /A, 92- &A%- o- (J:A- 5=- =- 3#?- 0:A- *J- 2R?- /A,,<A3- IA?- <2- +- .$:- 2:A- ?- /A- :,R2- :I<- 2?,,.J- /A- .R/- .- $*J<- 2?- =3- :.A- 3*/- 0<- IA?, 7 #$% ;/- <A%- 2<- 3J.- .- .$J- 5S$?- 2?$?- /?- !R%- *A.- 92- &A%- .A/- ?R$?- o- (J-2:A- 5=- =- 3#?- 0:A- *J- 2R?- /A- 5S$?- .R<- 2PR.- /?- <A3- IA?- <2- +- .$:-2:A- ?- /A- ,R2- 0<- :I<- 2?, <2- .$:A- ?- .J- /A- .R/- .- $*J<- 2?- :(.- :I<-IA- =3- :.A- 3*/- 0<- IA?- >A$- $R, $?3- 0- =- 2.$- 3J.- $*A?- GA- |R- /?- 2>.- 0- .%- , !R%- *A.- 2&- S$- $A- |R-/?- 2>.- 0:R, ,.%- 0R- =, 2.$- 3J.- $*A?- ?R- ?R<- 2>.- 0- .%- , .R/- 2#-2:R, ,.%- 0R- =, (R?- GA- 2.$- 3J.- .%- , $%- 9$- $A- 2.$- 3J.- 0:R, ,.%- 0R- =,=%- .%- <A$?- 0- $*A?- =?, 26The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 26"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"2.2.2.

(8ab) In the above quotation in which the Buddha teaches of the ten types ofequality, the first eight describe the equality of all phenomena from theperspective of actual and genuine truth; the ninth, by means of the sevenexamples of illusions and so forth, describes equality from the perspectiveof relative truth; and the tenth describes equality from the perspective ofboth the two truths. It is the case that from among these ten, when first,the equality of no arising is explained using the path of reasoning, the othernine are easy to describe.[125.19] Thus, four assertions of no arising are first enunciated andthen proven to be valid with logical reasoning. These assertions are as fol-lows: (1) There is no arising from self, because as it is said, “it does not orig-inate from itself.” (2) There is no arising from other, because if somethingdoes not originate from itself, “how could it originate from somethingelse?” (3) There is no arising from both, because if something does not arisefrom self and other individually, “it does not arise from self and othertogether” either.

Arising from self is contrary towhat is renowned in the world and would be endlessIf it were, as you think, that something already arisen should arise again,Then the sprout and what follows it would never have a chance to arise,And the seed would continue to arise again and again until the end ofexistence.How could something destroy its very self when it comes into existence? (9)[220] If it were possible, as you Samkhyas think, that a seed that has alreadyarisen should arise again, then in that situation it would follow that thesprout, stem, plant, and so forth—all the results that follow the seed—would never have a chance to arise themselves, because from the seed, theseeditself would arise, over and over, and with the earlier instances of aris-ing never ending, the later instances could not occur. “The seed will juststop arising all of a sudden, and then the sprout will arise,” you may claim,but that would be illogical, because with no obstacles to its arising fromitself, the seed would never stop arising from itself.Furthermore, the seed would continue to arise again and again until theend of existence, in other words, until samsara is empty, because if some-thing arises from itself, the conditions necessary for it to arise are alwayscomplete, and thus, without any obstacle to prevent it from arising, itwould be impossible for the seed to stop arising.You might say: “There is no pervasion,13because the cooperative con-ditions for the arising of the sprout, like water, time, and so forth, trans-form the actual cause, the seed, and produce the result, the sprout.Furthermore, the sprout does not exist at the same time as that which pro-duces it, and therefore, the sprout destroys the seed and comes into being.14Therefore, the supposed illogicality of the seed arising until the end of exis-tence in fact does not exist, and at the same time, since the seed and sproutare not different substances, arising from self is established.”How could it be, though, that the sprout—of the same entity of theseed—could destroy that seed whose very essence is none other than itsown? It could not do so, because the seed and the sprout are not differentsubstances. It is just as the seed is with its own nature.

Analysis of whether thecharacteristics of a cause and of its result are differentor not shows arising from self to be logically untenableAccording to your tradition, the sprout could never haveShape, color, taste, potency, or ripening different from those of its cause,the seed.If what was there earlier disappears and changes into something else,How could the earlier one become the later one? You say they are both thesame thing! (10)[221] If the seed and the sprout were one in nature, then in your Samkhyatradition the sprout could never have a shape, color, taste, potency, orripening that was different from any of these five qualities of the seed thatproduced the sprout. The reason for this is that the seed and the sproutare, according to you, one substance with one identity. If you agree withthe statement that the seed’s and sprout’s shape and so forth are not dif-ferent, then just as we do not see the seed’s shape and so forth, so we shouldalso not see the sprout’s shape and so forth. Since it is not like that, how-ever, it is logical that the sprout’s shape and so forth are different from theseed’s shape and so forth, just as a banana tree’s sprout is different from agarlic seed.The Samkhyas may counter with the following argument: “There is nopervasion, because the sprout gains its shape and other qualities after theseed’s shape and other qualities are abandoned.” If the seed and sprout arethe same substance, meaning that they are not different things, however,how could the earlier one become the later one? For if the seed’s shape andso forth, which existed earlier, disappeared and changed into somethingelse, namely the sprout’s shape and so forth, at that time what existedwould be the opposite of the entity of the seed. The Vaisheshikas15might assert, “Just because the seed’s and sprout’sshapes and other qualities are different does not mean that they cannot bethe same substance, and therefore there is no pervasion.” However, it isillogical to posit the existence of such a substance that would be differentfrom the seed’s and sprout’s shapes and other qualities, because it wouldbe illogical for that substance to be perceivable while its qualities of shapeand so forth were not.

[223]The reason for this is that since everyone in the world sees the result eventhough its cause has ceased, no one claims that a cause and its result areone and the same.

Since no characteristics canever possibly establish any phenomenon as truly existent in either genuineor conventional reality, how could any of the entities of these causes andconditions possibly exist? The Transcendent Conqueror did not teach“arising from other” as an expression of the definitive meaning, because hetaught that the appearance of arising is merely dependent arising.The otherBuddhist schools that claim that the four conditions’ existence is estab-lished by their own specific characteristics, and on the basis of that go onto assert arising from other, do not express the Transcendent Conqueror’sintention, because such assertions are contradicted both by the Buddha’sown statements and by logical reasoning. [227] If a thing arose from something different from itself, the conse-quence would be that pitch darkness would arise from a fire’s flames,because these two are different things. Furthermore, one cannot assert thatthis occurs, because our direct experience dispels both the original asser-tion and its consequences.[227.9] Everything—all results that are concordant with specificcauses, as well as things that are not—would arise from everything—allcauses of those specific results, as well as things that are not. Why is that?The reason is that, for example, things that are not the producers of a ricesprout, like fire, coal, and so on, would be equally different from a ricesprout, and these all would be just as different from the rice sprout as a riceseed would be. If someone should say, “I accept this!,” how could they? Itis refuted by our own direct experience, so how could it be possible?The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section A 51Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 51"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- =, *J?- %R%- $A- =/- .%- , .J- .$$- 0:R, .%- 0R- /A, <2- +- L- 2<- /?- 0- .J- KA<- :V?- 2<- %J?- 2eR.- &A%- ,,$%- 8A$- .J- *J.- /?- 0- .J- /A- $8/- /:%- o- ;A/- =,,o.- $&A$- $+R$?- .%- *J.- 0<- LJ.- =?- *J- 2- .J- ;A- KA<,,?- =:A- M- $- /?- =- ?R$?- =?- .J- v- 3A/- 8J- /,, 15o- :V?- $8/- ;A/- G%- ,3?- &.- =?- ,3?- &.- 3A- :L%- !J, o- :V?- %J?- 0-3,R%- 2:A- KA<, o- $%- $A?- <2- +- :V?- 2- 2*J.- 0<- L- 2<- /?- 0- .J:A- KA<-.J?- .J- 2*J.- 0- /A- .J:A- :V?- 2<- %J?- 0<- 2eR.- &A%- , :V?- 2- $%- 8A$- .J-2*J.- 0<- /?- 0- .J- /A- :V?- 2- =?- $8/- ;A/- /- ;%- o- ;A/- =, .J?- /- $8/-H.- 0<- &/- #R- /?- o- .%- :V?- 2<- :I<- IA, $8/- .- I<- 0- ,A- 43- o<-29%- /?- $8/- 0:A- ,A- wR$- $A?- :V?- 2- ,3?- &.- 2*J.- 0<- /A- 3- 5?- >A%- ,.J- ;%- ?- =:A- M$- v<- o.- $&A$- $+R$?- .%- :V?- 2- {.- &A$- *J.- 0<- LJ.- 0-{.- &A$- 2<- 3- (R.- 0:A- o- =?- *J- 2- .J:A- KA<- ?- =:A- M- $- ?R$?- /?- GA- ?- 2R/-?R$?- =?- :L%- 2- .J- v<- 3- ;A/- /R- 8J- /,,52The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 52"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.A rebuttal of opposingarguments2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.

(15)You, the opponent of the Middle Way, say : “A cause and its result are dif-ferent from each other, but that does not mean that everything arises fromeverything else, because we can see that the relationships between causesand their own specific results are definite. Whatever cause it is, it has theability to produce its own specific result, and therefore it does indeed pro-duce that result—it is therefore certain as to what its result will be. And,that thing that has the ability to produce that result is indeed the cause,even though it is different from the result. “Therefore, only specificdifferent things can be in a cause- result rela-tionship with each other; we do not claim that in general anything can bea cause that can in general produce everything that is in any way differentfrom itself. [228] In the case of the rice sprout, for example, the cause andthe result are in the same continuum and the instant of the result arisesfrom the instant of the cause that immediately precedes it, without any-thing coming in between.

Only one of them exists at atime. (19a- c)In the actual situation being examined, the cause’s cessation and the result’sarising are not simultaneous. The reason for this is that the sprout beingborn is only approaching birth, meaning that its birth is still in the futureand so it does notexist now, whereas the seed’s cessation is happening inthe present and so it doesexist now—it is still only approaching its disap-pearance. Therefore, when we assert the situation to be as such, there hasbeen no transformation into the result, meaning that the result has notarisen and so it does not exist now. On the other hand, the cause does existnow—it is in the process of ceasing, rather than being something that isonly approaching birth. Thus, how could the cause’s cessation and theresult’s arising be like the higher and lower arms of a scale? The two situa-tions are not equivalent, because the present simultaneous movement ofthe two arms of the scale is in fact the result of the past cause of removingthe measuring weight from one of the scale’s sides, whereas the activity ofthe cause’s cessation and the result’s arising cannot possibly occur at thesame time.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section A 61Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 61"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- /A,*J- 2- :.A- /A- LJ.- 0R- 3J.- 0<- <A$?- 0:A- %R- 2R:%- 3A/,, 19 %?- M$- $A- (R?- .$- .?- 3A- 3*3- ;%- *J- :$$- $A- L- 2- .?- 3*3- 3R- 8J- /, 3A- <%-!J, L- 2- (R?- =?- ,- ..- 0<- 3- P2- 0:A- KA<, $8/- ;%- M- $- *J- 2:A- L- 2- :.A-/A- LJ.- 0R- M- $- 3J.- 0<- ?- 2R/- :$$?- 0:A- 5K- (R?- &/, ;R.- 0<- <A$?- 0:A- %R-2R:%- 3- ;A/- +J, *J- 2:A- L- 2- LJ.- 0- 0R- M- $- /A- 3- :R%?- 0- ;A/- 0?- 3J.- =, .J-3J.- /- gJ/- LJ.- 0R- 3J.- 0<- 2gJ/- 0- L- 2- ;%- 3J.- 0:A- KA<, *J- :$$- $A- L- 2- .?-3*3- 0<- 3A- :P2- 2R,,62The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 62"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"[235]2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.2.2.The rebuttal of anattempt to answer the reason just givenFurthermore, “birth” in the absence of the one being born makes no sense at all. (19d)You might say, “The phenomena of the seed and sprout do not existsimultaneously, but the activities of their respective cessation and aris-ing do.” That would be illogical, however, because phenomena’s activi-ties do not exist apart from the phenomena themselves. We could alsoput it this way: The sprout’s activity of arising—occurring at the sametime as the seed is ceasing, and therefore at the same time that the sproutthat is the actor in this activity of arising does not exist—is an activitythat makes no sense at all, because the sprout that is supposedly doingthe arising is not present! The actor performing the activity is the sup-port for the activity being performed, and if the actor does not exist, theactivity does not exist either. Therefore, the activities of arising and ces-sation do not occur simultaneously.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section A 63Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 63"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- /A, $=- +J- 3A$- $A- ]R- =- <%- $A- *J.- LJ.- .?- $&A$- 0,,3A$- =- ?R$?- .%- z/- &A$- :L%- 2- :.- >J?- =- ?R$?- =?,,$8/- *A.- ;R.- /- ;R.- =- :L%- 2?- .$R?- 0- &A- 8A$- ;R.,,&A- !J- .J- 3J.- &J- /- :.A- =- *J?- 0- 2>.- 9A/- +R,, 20LJ- 5- ?R$?- o- :V?- .?- 3*3- :.R.- 0- .$- $A- 2?3- 0- =, ?- M$- $&A$- &<-3J.- /- $8/- *A.- 3A- :P2- 0?- *J- 2<- 3A- <A$?- =, $%- .- $&A$- &<- ;R.- 0- .J<-$8/- *A.- ;R.- 0?- *J- 2- ;R.- 0<- :I<- +J, .0J<- /- 3A$- $A- i3- >J?- .%- , .J-.%- z/- &A$- :L%- 8A%- 35%?- w/- IA- 5S<- ?R$?- ?J3?- L%- ,3?- &.- 1/- 5/-.?- 3*3- IA- o- :V?- ;A/- 0- v- 2:R, ,3A$- .%- $9$?- .%- 5S<- ?R$?- z/- &A$-:L%- 2- i3?- .?- 3*3- #R- /<- 3A$- $A- i3- >J?- 2*J.- 0- 28A/- .- 3A$- ?R$?-.%- ?J3?- ?R$?- G%- .?- 3*3- #R- /<- 5S<- ?R$?- i3?- GA- nJ/- .- :I<- <R- 8J-/, $=- +J- :V?- 2- 3A$- $A- ]R- =- <%- $A- *J.- LJ.- <%- .%- .?- $&A$- 0:A- 3A$- .%-$9$?- =- ?R$?- .%- , <%- .%- z/- &A$- :L%- 2:A- :.- >J?- =- ?R$?- ?J3?-?J3?- :L%- i3?- 3A$- $A- i3- 0<- >J?- 0- =?- $8/- *A.- .- ;R.- /- 3A$- $A- >J?-0- .J- ;R.- .$R?- +J, 3J.- /- .J- =?- $8/- .- :)R$- +- 3J.- 0:A- KA<, :.R.- /- :V?-2<- P2- 0:A- ;R.- 0- =- ;%- :L%- 2?- .$R?- 0- &A- 8A$- ;R.- .J- 3J.- 0<- ,=, *J?-9A/- 0:A- ;R.- 0<- I<- /- 3A$- .%- :.- >J?- ?R$?- *J.- LJ.- .- .R/- 3J.- 0:A- KA<, 64The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 64"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"[235.19]2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.2.2. Entities existingsimultaneously cannot arise from each other, so arisingfrom other in that situation is untenable If the eye- consciousness exists at the same time as what produces it—The eye and the other conditions, as well as the co- appearingdiscrimination that occurs—Then what need is there for this already existent eye- consciousness to ariseagain?If you say that it does not so exist, the faults in that view have already been explained. (20)[236.10] The Particularist School18and others assert that cause and resultexist simultaneously. According to them, if seed and sprout did not existat the same time, there would not be different entities existing, and there-fore for something to arise from something different than itself would belogically impossible. If they did exist simultaneously, however, then sincethere would be two different things, arising from other could in fact occur,as is the case with the eye- consciousness and all its co- appearing and con-comitant mental formations, such as feeling and so forth—these aremutual and simultaneously existent causes and results. Thus, the Particu-larists’ argument runs as follows: “The eye, form, feeling, and the other co- appearing factors produce the eye- consciousness that occurs simulta-neously with them, and at the same time, this simultaneously occurring eye- consciousness is a condition for their existence as well.”If, however, the eye- consciousness existed at the same time and as a dif-ferent entity from those that produce it—the eye, form, and so forth, aswell as discrimination and the rest of the primary minds and mental for-mations—and the eye- consciousness would have to so exist, because if itdid not, it could not be posited as being different from its causes, then thequestion is, why would this already existent result of the eye- consciousnessneed to arise again? The answer is that it would not, because it would bean existent entity that would have finished arising, and thus the eye, dis-crimination, and so forth that existed simultaneously with it would not inany way fulfill the function of being its producing causes.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section A 65Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 65"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"&A- !J- *J- 2- 3J.- 0<- 3A- :.R.- 0?- 3A$- $A- i3- >J?- .J- 3J.- .R- 8J- /, .J- {.- 5- 2- :.A-=- ;R.- 0- 3- ;A/- 0:A- ]R- =?- 3A$- =- ?R$?- 0- i3?- $8/- 3- ;A/- /R- 8J?- *J?- 0-2>.- 9A/- +R, ,.J?- /- i3- 0- ,3?- &.- .- $8/- =?- *J- 8J?- 0:A- 2eR.- L:A- .R/-IA?- !R%- 0:A- 1- 43- :2:- 8A$- =?- 0<- 9.- .J, .?- 3*3- 0- v- 2- =- $8/- YA.-.- ($- G%- *J- 2- 3A- YA., .J- 3A- YA.- 0?- $*A?- !- 3A- YA.- &A%- , }- KA- v- 2- $*A?-=- *J- 2- YA.- .- ($- G%- $8/- 3A- YA., .J- 3A- YA.- 0?- $*A?- !- 3A- YA.- 0:A- KA<, $?3- 0- /A, *J.- 0<- LJ.- 0- 2*J.- L- $8/- *J.- 0- .J- o- ;A/- /,,;R.- 0:3- :R/- +J- 3J.- .%- $*A- $- $*A?- V=- 8A$- *J.- P%- ,,;R.- /- *J.- LJ.- &A- .$R?- 3J.- =:%- .J?- /A- &A- 8A$- L,,$*A?- *A.- =- .J?- &A- L- $*A?- .%- V=- =:%- .J?- &A- L,, 21o- :V?- $*A?- =?- :V?- 2- o- =- 2vR?- 0:A- .?- ;R.- 0- 3A- ;A/- /R- 8J?- 0- /A,*J.- 0<- LJ.- 0- $%- $A?- 2*J.- L- <%- =?- .R/- $8/- *J.- 0<- LJ.- 0- .J- o- ;A/-0<- P%- /- 2*J.- L- ;R.- 0:3, :R/- +J- 3J.- 0- .%- $*A?- !:3- $*A?- !- .%-V=- 2- 8A$- 2*J.- P%- , ,.J- v<- /- ;R.- 0- *J- 3A- <A$?- +J, ;R.- /- *J.- LJ.- &A-.$R?- +J- *J?- 9A/- a<- ;%- *J- 2<- 3A- <A$?- 0:A- KA<, 3J.- 0- *J- 2<- 3A- <A$?- +J,2*J.- L- 3J.- 66The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 66"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Not wanting to assert that there is no arising, some might say, “All rightthen, the eye-consciousness does not exist in that way.” This would mean,however, that the nonexistent eye- consciousness could not be differentfrom the eye and so forth, and the faults in this view of arising from otherhave already been explained.Thus, in all its possible permutations, the view of “arising from other”is just an expression of empty sounds devoid of any real meaning, andnothing more than that.

All the faults inherent in the first two views aboveaccrue to this one. Furthermore, existence and nonexistence are twoentirely different states—one cannot possibly exist within the other, andtherefore it is impossible for there to be an entity that both exists and doesnot exist at the same time. Therefore, such an entity cannot be an objectproduced by causal conditions.[239.2] (4) It would be illogical for a product that was neither existentnor nonexistent to arise, for what would the causal conditions’ functionbe in that situation? A result that is neither existent nor nonexistent doesnot exist. Furthermore, when both refuted possibilities of existence andnonexistence are impossible, that which refutes them, the possibility ofneither existence nor nonexistence, is also impossible. [239.10] This verse demonstrates that not only the arising of a resultfrom something different than itself is illogical in each of the four possi-ble scenarios, but also that the arising of a result in any of these fourinstances from self, from both self and other, without cause, from the“principal,” Ishvara, or anything else, would also be logically unfeasible.Thus, dependent arising is explained to be free of the fabrications of thesefour possibilities.

Since even ordinary beings know that a thing arises from something different than itself,What need for reasonings to prove arising from other?” (22)You say, “Whatever logical reasonings we have put forward to prove aris-ing from other have burned away without a trace in the flames of yourintelligence, like firewood doused in oil. Enough, then—we do not needto supply you with any more kindling of logical reasonings to make theflames of your wisdom blaze any higher than they do at present.“Thus we cannot prove our position with logic. There is another wayfor us to accomplish our aim, however, because whatever reality is acceptedin the world cannot be controverted by logic—whatever is directly seen bythe world is too powerful for logic to deny. [240] Worldly beings do notpay attention to what might be logical or illogical, they simply follow theirown experience. On the basis of that they decide whether to engage withor reject a particular object, and having done so they are able to achievetheir goal. This is what causes us to assert that ordinary beings’ own expe-riences are direct valid cognition, and therefore, in our explanation of whyarising from other is tenable, why do we need to formulate logical reason-ings to prove our point? We do not need to do so, because ordinary beingsknow from their own direct perceptions that results arise from causes thatare different from themselves, and in this way the existence of arising fromother is established without needing to rely on logical reasoning. In thissituation, therefore, it is not necessary for us to exert ourselves in the for-mulation of reasonings. If something were not directly visible then itwould be appropriate to explain it with logical inferences, but when some-thing is directly visible, as is the case here, then it is inappropriate to uselogic to make inferences about it.” The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section A 71Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 71"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- =- $8/- *J- P2- G%- .J- #R- /- *A.- ,R.- 0:A- {2?- ?- 3A- $/R.- 0- .%- ,$8/- =?- *J- 2- :)A$- gJ/- 0- =- ;%- 3- P2- 0:R, ,.%- 0R- =, 8<- L%- 2.J/- 0-$*A?- GA- i3- $8$,.G?- 3- :)A$- gJ/- IA?- 3A- $/R.- 0<- 2!/- 0:R, ,.%- 0R-=- 2.J/- $*A?- GA- .LJ- 2- ,A<- 2!/, ?R- ?R:C- %R- 2R- o?- 0<- 2>.- 0:R, ,.%- 0R-=- .%R?- .%- , 8<- =- 3,R%- 2- 2m/- 0:A- .LJ- 2- 2!/- 0:R,, 72The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 72"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.2.Refuting the opponents’ position2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.

The actual explanationThere are two ways of seeing every thing: the authentic way and the falseway.Therefore, every thing found holds two natures within.The Buddha taught that authentic seeing sees reality’s precise natureAnd false seeing sees relative truth. (23)There are those people who do not understand the meaning of the treatisethat describes the profound topic of dependent arising.19With the habit-ual tendencies of clinging to things as being truly existent ripening in theirminds, they fixate on things. Not having heard that things’ very essence isempty by nature, while they sleep in this ignorance they mutter incom-prehensibly that arising from other exists in the world and that the ideathat it does not is contravened by the world’s direct valid cognition.If the fixation of those who mutter incomprehensibly in this way is tobe dispelled, two things must be explained to them: the way in which theterms false and true are respectively used to describe the occasions in thisworld of either being under the influence of confusion or not, and the waythat the precise nature of reality cannot be expressed as being either trueor false. [241]In order to teach, among other things, the distinctionbetween when worldly direct valid cognition controverts arising fromother and when it does not, the Transcendent Conqueror explained howthe two truths relate to all phenomena. When he explained things fromthe perspective of the two truths, he could illuminate for his disciples thedistinction between when something is a controvertible object and whenit is not.Thus, the Transcendent Conqueror presented the two truths withrespect to all inner and outer things, like sprouts and everything else. Gen-uine truthis described as being simply the authentic object of the nobleones’ original wisdom that sees what is authentic and true; there is no iden-tity actually established there for conceptual mind to find.

Within false see-ing as well there are classifications of authentic and false, and in order todescribe the perceived objects and perceiving subjects in each one of theseclassifications, the Buddha asserted that false seeing has two aspects. First,when no inner or outer causes of confusion (such as cataracts or jaundice)are causing any impairment, the six faculties are clear, and a consciousnessarising from such a faculty is renowned in the world as a correct perceiver.Second, when some cause of confusion is corrupting the six faculties, theyare said to be flawed. In dependence upon there being a consciousnessoccurring with uncorrupted, properly functioning faculties, the con-sciousnesses of an individual whose faculties are flawed are called mistakenconsciousnesses.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section A 77Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 77"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- =, ;=- =- 2.J/- 2m/- $*A?- ?- ,A<- .LJ- 2- .%- , ;=- 2m/- 0:A- .LJ-2- LJ- V$- +- 2>.- 0:R,, .%- 0R- /A, $/R.- 0- 3J.- 0:A- .2%- 0R- S$- i3?- GA?,,$9%- 2- $%- 8A$- :)A$- gJ/- IA?- gR$?- +J,,:)A$- gJ/- *A.- =?- 2.J/- ;A/- z$- 3- /A,,:)A$- gJ/- *A.- =?- =R$- 0<- i3- 0<- 28$, 25:)A$- gJ/- 0:A- 3,R%- 2- =- KA/- &A- =R$- 3- =R$- $*A?- ;R.- 0- v<- ;=- =:%- ;R.-.R- 8J?, KA- /%- $A- 2a.- 0?- $/R.- 0- 3J.- 0:A- .2%- 0R- S$- i3?- GA?- 29%- 2<-L- 2- $%- 8A$- :)A$- gJ/- IA?- gR$?- 0- !J, .J- /A- :)A$- gJ/- *A.- =- 2.J/- 0- ;A/- +J,:)A$- gJ/- IA- %R<- .J<- $%- =- 2.J/- 0<- 8J/- &A%- ,- ~.- .- 3A- 2a- 2:A- KA<,:1$?- 0- =- /A- .J- 2.J/- 0- 3A/- +J, 3*3- $8$- +- :$:- ;%- 3- $9A$?- >A%-eJ?- ,R2- +- .J- v<- $%- 2- /A- :O=- 0<- 2eR.- 0:A- KA<, z$- 3- .2%- 0R- $/R.-2&?- GA- ;=- .- $%- 2- /A- :)A$- gJ/- *A.- GA- 2.J/- 2m/- =- 2vR?- /?- =R$- 0<-i3- 0<- 28$- !J, :)A$- gJ/- 0- .$- .J- v:A- ;=- =- =- =- $%- 2- ;R.- G%- 2.J/-8J/- 3J.- =, =- =- 2.J/- 8J/- ;R.- G%- $%- 2- 3J.- 0?- ,/- 3R%- $A- ]%- .R<- IA- ;=-.- ,- ~.- 3A- LJ.- 0:A- KA<,78The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 78"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.2.1.2.The perceived objects2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.

It is they alone who say these things are real, because from the world’sperspective these things appear, are believed to be truly existent, and con-ventionally are undeceiving. These things are not real for noble beings,because they are not seen at all during the noble ones’ meditative equipoise,and because during the noble ones’ post- meditative stage of subsequentattainment things that appear in this way are called confused appearances. Everything else, meaning the objects that appear to impaired faculties,in reliance upon the world’s own understanding of what is true and whatis false, the world labels as mistaken. This is because some worldly beingsperceive the appearances of these objects but do not cling to them as beingreal, whereas others cling to true existence but do not perceive theseappearances—thus, they are not labeled as common objects to be acceptedor rejected.

Similarly, those immature beings whose cor-rupted and confused minds reject stainless wisdom and perceive insteadthe activity of arising from other cannot invalidate the stainless minds ofthe noble ones.

(28)Having stated that all things are of the nature of the two truths, worldlyrelative truth will now be described.Bewilderment is that which causes sentient beings to be ignorant aboutthe abiding nature of reality. Alternatively, it is that which imagines theabiding nature of reality to be something other than what it actually is andin this way obscures the view of its true nature. Such a phenomenon iscalled relativefor the reasons that have been explained. This relativeobscurer, whose nature is bewilderment, believes thatthings that have no inherent nature are in fact truly existent. It thereforedoes not engage in genuine reality. Instead, it imagines that these fabri-cated entities truly exist, and the dependently arisen power of doing thiscauses these entities to take on the appearance of truth. That, the MightyOne explained, is relative truth. [277.last] Moreover, shravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvashave abandoned afflicted ignorance and see composite phenomena asbeing similar in the quality of their existence to reflections and so forth.For them, therefore, the relative is of a nature that resembles fabricatedthings rather than being something true, because they do not wronglyassume it to be true. Relative truth deceives immature beings, but the nobleones know it to be illusory, merely relative, and of the essence of depend-ent arising.

(29)Having thus described the first truth, now in the teaching on the second,since it cannot actually be conceived of or expressed, Chandrakirti usesan example that is in accord with ordinary individuals’ experience toexplain it.For a person whose eyes are stricken by disease, the power of that ail-ment makes him imagine that falling hairs and other false entities exist inhis eating bowl. Wishing to be rid of this difficulty he turns the bowl upsidedown, but in vain. Along comes a person with flawless eyesight who, notseeing the falling hairs in the first place, has no concepts of any qualitiesthe falling hairs might have, like whether they are things or an absence ofthings, whether they are falling hairs or not, or whether their color is bluelike a gemstone or not. Then, when the person with flawless eyesight tellsthe person with faulty vision that there are no falling hairs in the bowl, shedoes not commit the fault of denying the existence of something actuallythere. The quality of the falling hairs in the bowl as seen by the one withflawless eyesight is their actual nature precisely; what the person with faultyvision sees is not the hairs’ actual nature at all. Similarly, in the context of this analysis of the two truths, the followingdistinction can be made: When ignorance does not see the precise natureof reality, the aggregates and other phenomena that it does perceive are therelative. [285] As the person with flawless eyesight does not see the fallinghairs, so the perfect Buddha, free of the disease of ignorance, does not seethe aggregates and so forth, but instead sees their true nature. This is howyou should understand genuine reality to be.

In fact there would be no need for the noble beings,because worldly beings would see the precise nature of things as it wasestablished by their own valid cognition, and in this way they would aban-don ignorance on their own.[289.7] You might wonder, “Even though worldly beings see the pre-cise nature of reality, wouldn’t they still need to listen to the teachings onskillful means and to rely on the noble path of ethics and so forth?”What, however, would listening to, analyzing, or practicing the teach-ings of this path accomplish? All that discipline would not lead to anyworthwhile result, because worldly beings’ eyes and so forth wouldalready be validly realizing the precise nature of reality, and since realiz-ing that is enough to achieve liberation, all other “noble paths” would beunnecessary.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section A 89Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 89"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":";%- :)A$- gJ/- 0:A- 5.- 3?- .J- *A.- 3,R%- ;%- 3- <A$- 3- %%?- 0?- :1$?- 0<-3- I<- +R- 8J?- .R$?- /, :R- /- 3- <A$- 0?- ]/- 0R<- I<- 0:A- ]R- 5.- 3- <A$?- 0:%-3- ;A/- /R- !J, ;=- $%- =- ;=- &/- $%- 3- gR$?- 0- .J- 5.- 3- 3- ;A/- 0:A- KA<,/R<- 2- 3#/- 0R- 3A/- 0?- /R<- 2- 3A- >J?- 0- 28A/- /R,,$*A?- 0- /A, i3- !/- :)A$- gJ/- 5.- 3A/- .J- ;A- KA<,,.J- *A.- {2?- ?- :)A$- gJ/- $/R.- 0- 3J.,, 31 !#.J- #R- /- *A.- i3- 0<- .JR.- 0:A- {2?- ?- :)A$- gJ/- IA?- $/R.- 0- 3J.- .J, .J:A- o-35/- .J- *A.- .JR.- {2?- ?- i3- !/- :)A$- gJ/- 5.- 3- 3- ;A/- 0- .J:A- KA<, :O=->J?- GA- 3,R%- 2?- 3- :O=- 2:A- 3,R%- 2- =- $/R.- 0- 3J.- 0- 28A/- /R,,90The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 90"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Still, you might have the following doubt: “Worldly beings’ valid cog-nition may see the precise nature of reality, but if they have not abandonedignorance, they will not transform into noble beings.” If that is the case,however, then for their minds, having been made foolish by ignorance, tocognize validly would be illogical.

(31cd)You might ask, “Well then, exactly when would the world be able to con-trovert something?” The answer is that if worldly objects themselves aredenied, then since these objects are renowned in the world, worldly beingscan controvert such denials. For example, someone might say, “A substanceof mine was stolen!” Someone else may ask, “What substance?,” to whichthe first person would reply, “A vase!” If the second person attempts to faultthis statement by saying, “A vase is not a substance because it is an objectof comprehension, like a vase in a dream,” then worldly beings can con-trovert that. This is the case because first of all, worldly beings assert thatvases in the waking state truly exist, whereas they do not assert that vasesin dreams truly exist, and therefore the example of the dream that the sec-ond person offered is not equivalent to the actual situation that the firstperson experienced; and second of all, because worldly beings do notbelieve in subtle logical analysis. When one relies on the vision of the nobleones, however, and takes the cognition of the wise to be valid cognition,at that time worldly beings cannot controvert anything. Knowledgeable individuals will apply this thesis to other situations aswell. For example, someone might say, “Whatever cannot see itself cannotsee something other than itself; for example, a vase. The eye cannot seeitself, either.”22Someone else may reply by saying, “It is commonly knownin the world that the eye sees things other than itself,” or something sim-ilar to that, but all such cases of taking worldly renown to be valid cogni-tion cannot controvert the enlightened vision of the noble ones.

(32)[299] Followers of the Middle Way express things in harmony withworldly convention and modes of perception, but even so, the world doesnot controvert the refutation of arising from other. Leave aside the possi-bility that things arise from other in the precise nature of reality; there isnot even any arising from other in terms of what beings in the worldbelieve. The reason for this is that just from planting a seed in the mother’swomb, later when a male child is born, worldly people say, “I producedthat boy!” And, just from planting a mango seed, later when a mango treegrows, they think, “I planted that tree!” They do not, however, view theseed and the result to be entities made of different substances.Furthermore, the father does not extract his child from his own bodyand place it in the mother’s womb, nor when planting a seed does a per-son put an entire tree complete with branches and leaves into the ground.Therefore, worldly beings do not believe that cause and result are the samething, either.Since they do not assert arising from other, worldly people say thingslike, “I produced that boy” and “I planted that tree.” If it were otherwise,however, and they did assert production from other, they would never saythings like, “That’s my boy” and so forth.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section A 95Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 95"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- =, gJ/- :VJ=- g$- (.- 3J.- 0<- P2- 0:A- ;R/- +/- 2!/, %R- 2R<- P2- /-!R%- *A.- {<- :.J2?- ?- :I<- 2:A- *R/- 2!/- 0:R,, .%- 0R- /A,$%- KA<- M- $- ?- 2R/- =?- $8/- 3A/,,.J- KA<- M$- 5K- ?- 2R/- 8A$- 0- 3J.,,$%- KA<- $&A$- *A.- ;R.- 3A/- .J- KA<- ;%- ,,M$- 5K- ?- 2R/- ;R.- &J?- 2eR.- 3A- L,, 33:.A<- ?- M$- $8/- 0<- I<- /- (R?- &/, M- $- *J?- 0:A- 5K- /- ?- 2R/- o/- (.- 0<-:I<- +J, $8/- ;A/- 0:A- KA<, 2- 3J/- ;R.- 0?- 2- =%- >A- ;%- 2- =%- o/- 3- (.-*0<- 3A- :I<- 2- .%- , ?R- *J- ;R.- 0?- :1$?- 0- M- %/- =?- 3- :.?- 0- 3- ;A/- 0-28A/- /R, ,.J?- /- M- $- *J?- 0:A- 5K- ?- 2R/- 8A$- &A%- o/- (.- 0- 3J.- .J, $%- KA<-M- $- ?- 2R/- =?- $8/- 3A/- 0- .J:A- KA<- 5=- .J?- (.- 0- %%?- 0- ;A/- /R, ,M$- 5K-?- 2R/- ;R.- &J?- 2eR.- 0<- 3A- L- !J, $%- $A- KA<- ?- M$- $&A$- *A.- .- ;R.- 0- 3-;A/- 0- .J:A- KA<- <R, ,5=- .J?- g$- 0- i3- 0<- %%?- 0- ;A/- /R,,96The Moon of Wisdom* With Khenpo Rinpoche’s approval, this phrase, which appears in the manuscript of the textas 2- =%- >A- ;%- 2- 3J/- o/- 3- (.- - - - has been corrected to read the way it appears herein.Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 96"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.

For example, the existence of a wild ox does not prevent a cow’scontinuum from being cut when the cow dies, nor does the existence ofan ordinary individual prevent a noble being from passing into nirvana.Therefore, when the sprout arises, the seed does not cease and its contin-uum is not cut, because the sprout is not different from the seed. In thisway, this mode of explanation abandons the extreme of extinction. [300] Nor is it expressed that the seed exists at the time of the sprout,because seed and sprout are not the same thing.

(34)Thus, it is definitely necessary to assert without doubt that things do notarise by virtue of their own specific characteristics. If it were not like that—if all phenomena from form through omniscience were not mere concep-tual imputations, but rather, if in dependence upon causes and conditions,their specific characteristics arose in essence—then since emptiness wouldimply that things have no inherent nature when in fact they would haveone after all, emptiness would therefore be a destroyer of things.

Therefore, analyze relative phenomena if you havethe precise nature of reality in mind, but since worldly beings posit the rel-ative without analyzing it, then you should not analyze the world’s con-ventional truth, either.Thus, when worldly beings without analyzing say, “When this thing Isee here exists, then this other one will arise,” it is appropriate to followafter them in merely this type of description, because one must dependupon the activity of accepting and rejecting within that conventionalrealm in order to enter the precise nature of reality.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section A 101Moon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 101"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- /A, .J- *A.- {2?- ?- <A$?- 0- $%- 8A$- $A?,,2.$- .%- $8/- =?- *J- 2- <A$?- 3A/- 0:A,,<A$?- .J?- ,- ~.- .- ;%- <A$?- 3A/- 0?,,HR.- GA- *J- 2- $%- $A?- ;A/- 0<- :I<,, 36.%R?- 0R- =- 8J/- v- &/- .$- .%R?- 0R<- P2- 0- ,3?- &.- 2.J/- 0- $*A?- !<- ;R.-0- i3- 0<- .J.- 0- =- :)A$- gJ/- (.- GA- .R$?- 0?- VJ.- .J- :#R<- :.?- .%- !/-/?- *R/- 3R%?- .%- , i3- L%- $A- o<- I<- 0:A- m?- GA- %R- 2R<- P2- 0:A- (R?- >A$-;R.- .R- 8J?- 5- /, .J- v<- ;R.- .R- 8J?- 5B$- +- 5?- G%- $/?- 5S.- =- :P2- 0- 3-;A/- 0?, .R/- .3- .J- #R- /- *A.- .JR.- 0:A- {2?- ?- )A- {.- 2>.- 0:A- <A$?- 0-$%- 8A$- $A?- .%R?- 0R- i3?- 2.$- .%- $8/- =?- *J- 2- <A$?- 0- 3- ;A/- 0<- P2-0:A- <A$?- 0- .J?- ,- ~.- .- ;%- 2.$- $8/- =?- *J- 2- ?R$?- <A$?- 0- 3- ;A/-0?- HR.- GA- 2.J/- 0- $*A?- !<- *J- 2- $%- $A- ;A/- 0<- :I<- +J- *J- 2<- 3A- :P2-2R,,102The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_1J 6/30/09 10:03 AM Page 102"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"[310.19] 2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.2.

[315] The result that is itself not real, the mere sem-blance of a result, is posited in dependence upon causes and conditions;however, the causes and conditions themselves are not real, either. It is justas is the case that in a mirror or somewhere else the focal condition of areflection or some other phenomenon that is empty of inherent nature isa cause from which a result arises, namely a subject perceiving that focalcondition, a consciousness beholding the image of that reflection.

Therefore, from the perspective of conventional real-ity, which is false and deceiving, it is neither impossible nor untenable fora composite karmic result to arise from an unarisen, unceasing, undecay-ing noncomposite. Therefore, even though no alaya or any other entitythat might be a support for karmic causes and results truly exists, karmicresults can still arise in the future from karmic actions committed in thepast. Sometimes, a long period of time elapses after the action has ceased,but no matter—know that its fully ripened result will most certainly arise,and there is absolutely nothing contradictory about its doing so. [351.10] 2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.3.1.2.Proving this with anexampleHaving seen objects in a dream, Desire for them arises in fools even after they awake.In the same way, even though karmic actions have ceased and have noinherent nature,Results are still fully able to arise from them. (40)Someone may say, “If in genuine reality it is illogical for karmic results toarise from actions that have no inherent nature, and in relative reality it isillogical for results to arise from actions that have ceased, then how muchmore illogical would it be for a result to arise from an action that both lacksinherent nature and has ceased.” As a reply, the point expressed in the lastverse will now be explained by means of an example.Fully ripened results still arise from karmic actions even though thoseactions have ceased a long time ago and have no inherent nature, becausefor example, when a fool dreams of desirable objects and of having inter-course with a beautiful woman, when he wakes up that dream woman canstill be a cause for desire arising within him even though she does not trulyexist and even though she ceased when the dream ended. The situationhere with karmic cause and result is equivalent to this example. In Chan-drakirti’s own commentary on the text, he quotes the Buddha’s extensiveexplanation of this example and its meaning from the Transference of Exis-tence Sutra.

Although empty,karmic causes and results are nevertheless individuallycertain and inconceivableTherefore, we see that the causes of negative results are nonvirtuous actionsAnd only positive results ripen from virtuous actions.Those who realize that there is neither virtue nor nonvirtue gainliberation;The Buddha stopped the analysis of cause and result. (42)The above example not only demonstrates that the full ripening of karmicactions into results is definite; it also shows that their specificity is definite,because even though the falling hairs have no inherent nature, they defi-nitely appear to one suffering from that specific eye disease. Therefore,even though virtuous and nonvirtuous actions have no inherent nature,we see that the cause of a negative and unpleasant ripened result is pre-cisely a nonvirtuous, negative action, whereas only positive and pleasingresults ripen from positive, virtuous actions. We do not see, however, pos-itive results arising from nonvirtuous actions. Furthermore, when wiseindividuals have the acuity to realize that neither virtuous nor nonvirtu-ous karmic actions have any inherent nature, they gain liberation.This way in which karmic actions lacking inherent nature give rise toresults and how it is that the specificity of those fully ripened results is cer-tain is very difficult to realize. The Transcendent Conqueror therefore toldthose ordinary individuals who, if they tried to definitively analyze karmiccause and result, would deny its existence and then become frightened thatthe relative world would disintegrate, not to engage in such analysis. “Howit is that results ripen from karmic actions is inconceivable,” the Buddhataught, and thereby stopped immature beings from analyzing the con-nections between actions and their results. He did this because ordinarybeings do not have the capacity to understand the precise connectionsbetween causes and results implicit in statements like, “From this action,that result will arise.” For how it is that karmic actions and results do notinherently exist but nevertheless appear in a way that is specific, unde-ceiving, and seemingly truly existent is something that can only be knownthrough the power of the precise knowledge arising from listening, reflect-ing, and meditating.

Thus from those individuals’ perspective the alaya can-not be said to be completely nonexistent, because the teachings about it,which are not to be taken literally and therefore have a hidden intention,the Buddha gave to those who needed to be tamed in that particular way—he taught them that the alaya exists.

The Buddha was refer-ring to emptiness alone when he described the existence of a thing calledalaya, because emptiness is the all- pervading true nature of everything.24Thus, whenever in the sutras the Buddha taught that the alaya- consciousness is the support of karmic actions and results; whenever hetaught the particular disciples to be tamed that the individual also exists,as he did when he stated:Bhikshus, the five aggregates are the burden, And the individual is the one who carries this burden;and whenever he taught to some others that the aggregates absent the selfare alone what exist, the reason he did so was that those who have the viewthat things truly exist could not immediately understand emptiness, themost profound nature of reality. [355] In order to help these disciplesengage in the teachings gradually, the Buddha taught them that the alayaand so forth exist, because later, when they could understand the mean-ing of the Buddha’s perfect speech in an unmistaken way, they could giveup their attachment to the alaya and so forth as well. This manner of giv-ing teachings is only the source of qualities and is not flawed in any way,because whenever one of the Buddha’s teachings is explained, the time inthe aeon that the teaching was given and the state of the mindstreams ofthe disciples who received it must be determined and taken into account.

The third of those verses sets the coursefor the refutation that follows:Therefore, an other powered entityServes as the cause for things that exist as designations:It arises in the absence of external, apprehended objects,Exists, and exists as a nature that is not an object for all elaborations.In verses 48 through 83, Chandrakırti disassembles the assertion of an otherpowered entity that serves as the cause for things such as visible forms. Asthis other powered entity has three qualities—cognition that neitherrequires nor involves external objects, substantial existence, and freedomfrom the elaborations—Chandrakırti addresses each of these in turn.He asks his opponents to provide an example for cognition in theabsence of an object external to consciousness. They offer three: dreams,the strands of hair that are seen by those whose eyes are diseased, and theskeletons imagined by a yogin or yoginı immersed in meditation uponugliness. Chandrakırti replies to those suggestions in verses 48 to 53, 54 to68, and 69 to 70, respectively. In verse 71, he considers a fourth example,the pus seen by hungry ghosts where human beings see water. In this seriesof verses, Chandrakırti refutes the possibility of cognition in the absenceof external objects.The substantial existence of the other powered entity serving as the basefor other phenomena is analyzed and rejected in verses 72 to 76.

In verses 78 to 80, he studies the asser-tion of a causal relationship tying this other powered entity to the con-ventional phenomena that conceal suchness. He finds this assertion to bedefensible neither from the perspective of the world’s customs nor fromthe perspective of the two truths.Having concluded his refutation of the tenets set forth by the Propo-nents of Perception, in verses 84 to 97 Chandrakırti offers alternatives totheir explanations of the passages in scripture upon which they rely, a mis-understanding of which has driven them to invent a system of tenets thathe finds to be deeply flawed. Here Chandrakırti explores the meaning ofthe phrase mind onlyand introduces the difference between a definitivemeaning and a meaning that requires interpretation.

Similarly, a like-ness of the forms of objects dawns for a consciousness but is not differentfrom the consciousness.32The Refutation of the Proponents of Perception 199Moon of Wisdom_2J 6/30/09 10:11 AM Page 199"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":",$?3- 0- /A,,kA- =3- /- /A- $9$?- .R/- $8/- 3J.- 0<,,<%- /?- (A/- =?- .J- ;A- i3- &/- ?J3?,,:L%- 2- )A- v- .J- 28A/- ?.- =:%- :.A<,,KA- <R=- 3J.- 0<- ;A.- /A- ;R.- &J- /, 64,:.A<- ?.- 0:A- $/?- {2?- =:%- KA- <R=- 3J.- 0<- ;A.- GA- i3- >J?- /A- ;R.- 0-;A/- +J, .0J<- /- kA- =3- /- /A- $9$?- ?R$?- .R/- $8/- 3J.- 0<- <%- .%- eJ?- ?-3,/- 0:A- /?- 0- (A/- 0- =?, $9$?- ?R$?- ;=- .J:A- i3- 0- &/- IA- ;A.- GA-?J3?- :L%- 2- )A- v- 2- .J- 28A/- /R- 8J- /,,$*A?- 0- =- $/R.- LJ.- ;R.- 0- .%- , 12- LJ.- 3J.- 0- $*A?, .%- 0R- =- /?- 0-=?- i3- >J?- *J- /- =R%- 2- =- 3A$- >J?- *J- 2<- ,=- 2- .%- , kA- =3- /- ;=- .2%-;R.- 3J.- 35%?- 0- $*A?,200The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_2J 6/30/09 10:11 AM Page 200"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"2.1.1.2.2.2.1.3 Showing with an example (431:4)They may say, “In dreams, without other objects, [such as] forms,Through the ripening of its energy, a mind having their aspectarises.Just like that, also when we are awake here,Without the external, there is mental [consciousness].” (64)They may say, “Also when we are awake here, there is mentalcon-sciousness without the external.

In a nonmistaken, which is to say nonpolluted, perspective, nei-ther appears to exist.422.1.1.5 Summary of the topic (447:2)In brief, understand this meaning: “Just as the object of cognitiondoes not exist,Like that, awareness also does not exist.” (71cd)In brief, understand this meaning: “Just as the object of cognition doesnot existinherently, like that, awarenesshaving its aspect also does notexistinherently.” This is because they are posited by way of mutual con-tingency.43The Refutation of the Proponents of Perception 215alas, karmaMoon of Wisdom_2J 6/30/09 10:11 AM Page 215"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":",$*A?- 0- =, 12- LJ.- 3J.- 0?- $*A?- 3J.- GA- $8/- .2%- ;R.- 0- 3A- :,.,<%- <A$- $A- 12- LJ.- .$$- 0- $*A?,.%- 0R- /A,,$=- +J- $9%- 3J.- :6B/- 0- *A.- V=- 8A%- ,,$*A?- GA?- !R%- 0:A- $8/- .2%- .%R?- ;R.- /,,:.A- ;A- ;R.- 0- $%- $A?- >J?- 0<- :I<,,3- 29%- 2<- ;%- ;R.- &J?- L<- 3A- <%- , 72$=- +J- $9%- 3J.- :6B/- 0- *A.- V=- 8A%- , $9%- :6B/- $*A?- GA?- !R%- 0:A-$8/- .2%- $A- .%R?- 0R- .R/- .3- 0<- ;R.- /- :.A:A- ;R.- 0- *A.- ;=- &/- $%- $A?->J?- 0<- :I<- 8J?- .R$?- 0- 2a%- /?, <%- *A.- GA?- :6B/- 0- /A- 3A- :,.- .J,<%- $A?- <%- =- L- 2- :$=- 2:A- KA<, 3J?- <%- $A- 2.$- *A.- 3A- YJ$- 0- 28A/,>J?- 0- }- 3- ?R$?- >J?- 0- $8/- IA?- :6B/- 0- 3A/- +J, <%- $A- P2- 3,:- .%-:$=- 2:A- KA<- +J, i3- <A$- $8/- 8A$- i3- <A$- $A- ;=- ;A/- /- i3- <A$- 0- 43-*A.- .R- 8J?- 5?- 0- *3?- 0<- :I<- 2:A- KA<, ;=- &/- :$:- 8A$- $A?- 3- 29%-2<- ;%- ;R.- &J?- L<- 3A- <%- !J, @- &%- ,=- 2:A- KA<,216The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_2J 6/30/09 10:11 AM Page 216"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"2.1.2 Refutation of a nondual other powered that issubstantially established (447:6)This has two parts:1 With nothing establishing it, the existence of a nondual other pow-ered is not feasible2 Refutation of the establishment of a knower of itself2.1.2.1 With nothing establishing it, the existence of anondual other powered is not feasible (447:6)Were there an other powered thing lacking an apprehended,Free from apprehension, and empty of duality,What would cognize its existence?“Although not apprehended, it exists,” may not be claimed.

Similarly, whatever is asserted to be the creator—mind, or the prin-cipal and so on—it is not reasonable to refute form, as it is needed and, solong as it is not analyzed, does exist conventionally.67The Refutation of the Proponents of Perception 259Moon of Wisdom_2J 6/30/09 10:11 AM Page 259"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"$?3- 0- =, $*A?- !- 2.J/- $*A?- ;R.- 3J.- 35%?- 0- .%- , 2.J/- $*A?-2>A$?- /?- m?- 3A- :P2- 0- .%- , .R/- 2#- 2- $?3, .%- 0R- =, <A$?- 0-.%- , =%- $A- 12- LJ.- 35%?- 0- $*A?, .%- 0R- =, *J?- :1$?- $*A?- GA- ]R-%R<- 35%?- 0- .%- , .J.- 3- .J.- .- 35%?- 0- $*A?,.%- 0R- /A,,:)A$- gJ/- 0- ;A- .J- *A.- =- $/?- =,,1%- 0R- :)A$- gJ/- P$?- +J- s- (<- ;R.,,.J- *A.- ;J- >J?- :(<- 2<- :.R.- 0- /,,i=- :LR<- 0- =- .J- s- :L%- 3A- :I<, 91,KA- .R/- 3J.- =- /%- >J?- 0- ;R.- 0- /A- LA?- ]R- =?- ;A/- /3- :1$?- 0:A- $9A$?- %R-/?- ;A/, .%- 0R- v<- /- .J- %R<- .J- s- &<- ;R.- .J, $R%- .- 2!/- 0- v<- ]R- :)A$-gJ/- 0- ;A- 3,R%- 2:A- .J- #R- /- *A.- =- $/?- 0- =- /A- 1%- 0R- s- (<- ;R.- 35%?- ?-:)A$- gJ/- =- P$?- 0- !J- .J- *A.- GA- KA<, $*A?- 0- v<- /- i=- :LR<- 0- =- .J- %R<-s- &<- :L%- 2<- 3A- :I<- +J, .J- *A.- gR$?- 0:A- ;J- >J?- :(<- 2<- :.R.- 0- /- !J-gR$?- 0- /- 3R?- 35/- ,3?- &.- *J- 2<- 8A- 2:A- KA<,260The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_2J 6/30/09 10:11 AM Page 260"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"2.2.2.1.3 Showing that form and mind are equally existent ornonexistent (484:5)This has three parts:1Both are equivalent in the existence or nonexistence of the two truths2A substantial entity will not be established when the two truths havebeen demolished3Summary of the topic2.2.2.1.3.1 Both are equivalent in the existence ornonexistence of the two truths (484:6)This has two parts:1In reasoned proofs, they are equivalent2In scriptural proofs, they are equivalent2.2.2.1.3.1.1 In reasoned proofs, they are equivalent (484:6)This has two parts:1They are equivalent for the perspective of the awareness of ordinaryand superior persons2They are equivalent when analyzed and when not analyzed2.2.2.1.3.1.1.1 They are equivalent for the perspective of theawareness of ordinary and superior persons (485:1)For those who abide in worldly suchness,The aggregates customary in the world, all five, exist.When the wisdom of suchness is asserted to dawn,For a yogin, the five will not arise.

For example, since onesesame seed can produce sesame oil, then many seeds can produce a lot ofoil, but since one grain of sand cannot produce any sesame oil, many grainsof sand together cannot produce any oil either.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section B 295Moon of Wisdom_3J* 6/30/09 10:13 AM Page 295"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"28A- 0- =, %R- 2R- *A.- 5- 2- .$$- 0- .%- , ?J3?- 0- :L%- 2- =?- I<- 0- .$$- 0-$*A?, .%- 0R- =, 2.J/- 0- $*A?- &<- .- .$$,.3A$?- ?- 3A- <%- 2:A- :,.-0?- .$$- 0- $*A?, .%- 0R- /A, $=- +J- o- 3J.- #R- /<- *J- 2<- v- >A$- :I<- /- /A,,.J- 5K- 3,:- .$- g$- +- ,3?- &.- =?- G%- *J- :I<- 8A%- ,,:V?- :L%- (J.- .- :)A$- gJ/- :.A- ;A- ?- 2R/- =- ?R$?- /A,,2o- U$- .$- $A- |R- /?- #.- 0<- LJ.- 0<- ;%- 3A- :I<,, 99$=- +J- KA- /%- $A- .%R?- 0R- ,3?- &.- o- 3J.- #R- /<- *J- 2<- v- 8A$- :I<- /- /A, .J-5K- :V?- 2- 3,:- .$- .?- g$- +- o- ;A/- 3A/- ,3?- &.- =?- G%- *J- 2<- :I<- +J,)A- v<- 2- /- ?:A- >A%- .J- >A%- ,R$- $A- o- 3A/- 0- =?- *J- 2- v<- A- W- ?R$?- G%- o-3A/- .J- =?- *J- 2<- :I<- 2:A- KA<- +J, o- 3- ;A/- 0<- :S- 2:A- KA<, .J- 28A/- .- A-W- ?R$?- (A/- 0- .?- GA- H.- 0<- =- 2vR?- 0- .J- ;%- .?- g$- +- ;R.- 0<- :I<- +J,.?- =- 3A- 2vR?- 0:A- KA<, .J- 28A/- .- k- L- k- L:A- 3.R%?- GA- o- 3A/- 0- 28A/- L-<R$- =- ;%- k- L:A- 3.R%?- ;R.- 0<- :I<- <R, ,.J?- /- :PR- !/- ;=- .?- ,3?-&.- .- *J- /- .J- ;%- ;R.- 0- 3- ;A/- /R,,296The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_3J* 6/30/09 10:13 AM Page 296"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.4.The refutation of causeless arising 2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.4.1.

Forexample, just as banasa fruit would arise from the banasa tree, which wouldnot be the banasa fruit’s cause, so banasa fruit would also arise from non- causes like mangoes and so forth, because they would equally be non- causes of the banasa fruit as its own tree. Furthermore, mangoes and allother fruits that ripen only at particular times would always ripen, becausethey would not need to depend on time in order to do so. Similarly, pea-cocks would not be the causes of the eyes on peacock feathers, and ravenswould have such eyes on their feathers as well.

It is just as when they assert thetrue existence of the elements of earth and so forth, which in actuality donot exist.

(103)[450] Someone who has not abandoned or even given rise to doubts aboutthe view that the elements of earth and so forth truly exist might say, “Theabove example, that the body is equivalent to being the basis of the mis-taken view that the elements truly exist, is not established as valid.” How-ever, we do not need to prove that this concordant example of the elementsbeing unborn and lacking in true existence is valid, because we have alreadyexplained how it is that the elements lack inherent existence. We explainedthis above with the universal refutations of the arising of any and all things,whether from self, other, both, or without cause. Since the validity of aris-ing from self and so forth was universally refuted in this way, no elementsthat are exempt from these refutations exist. The elements therefore haveno inherent nature, and the view of them as being truly existent has notthe slightest ground on which to stand. In this way, the example is estab-lished as valid. [452.2] 2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.The conclusion to draw from therefutation of arising: phenomena have no inherent natureSince things do not arise from self, other, both, nor without cause,They have no inherent nature at all. (104ab)Thus, if arising that actually existed were possible, it would have to be con-ceived of as arising from one of the four extremes—nothing else would bepossible. Thus, one may assert arising from Ishvara or anything else, butit must be arising from one of the four extremes—no fifth extreme exists. Therefore, things have no inherent nature at all, because they do notarise from self, other, both, nor without cause.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section B 305Moon of Wisdom_3J* 6/30/09 10:13 AM Page 305"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- =, 3,R%- 2- .%- :$=- 2- %%- 2- .%- , <%- 28A/- 3J.- /- ,- ~.- .- ;%-;R.- 0<- :$=- 2:A-lR.- 0- %%- 2- $*A?, .%- 0R- =, $+A- 3$- $A- .2%- $A?- 3A-3#?- 0?- 3,R%- 2:A- 5=- .%- , 3#?- 0- =- 3A- $%- 2:A- 5=- $*A?, .%- 0R- =,.%R?- 0R- .%- , .%R?- 3J.- 3,R%- 2:A- :$=- %%- $*A?, .%- 0R- /A, $%- $A?- 3A/- 5S$?- .%- 35%?- $+A- 3$- !$- 0R- :)A$- gJ/- =,,;R.- 0- .J?- /- ;=- i3?- =R$- 0- .$- +- $%- 2<- :I<,, 104 $%:R- /- }R/- 0R- ?R$?- GA- .%R?- 0R- 3- *J?- >A%- ;=- .- 3A- :I<- 2?- 3- 29%- /- ;%-;%- .- 3./- /- $%- 2- .J- &A- 8J- /, ;=- i3?- 3,R%- 2- /A- <%- 28A/- )A- v- 2- 3- ;A/-0<- 3%R/- 8J/- &/- i3?- =- KA/- &A- =R$- 0- .$- +- $%- 2<- :I<- 2- ;A/- +J, $%-$A?- /3- 3#:A- <%- 28A/- 1A2- LJ.- GA- (<- 3A/- IA- 5S$?- .%- 35%?- 0:A- $+A-3$- $A- 3/- 0- 3,$- 0R?- /3- 3#:A- }R/- 0R:C- <%- 28A/- !R%- 0- *A.- 3,R%- 2-IR$?- /?- $/?- 0- :)A$- gJ/- 0- =- ;R.- 0- .J?- /:A- KA<,306The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_3J* 6/30/09 10:13 AM Page 306"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"2.3.1.1.1.2.1.2.The rebuttal of arguments opposing the refutation of arising2.3.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.

To thosewho cling to things as being truly existent, things appear in a mistaken way,for just as a mass of dark rain clouds obscures the true nature of the sky, sothe thick darkness of worldly beings’ bewilderment blocks their vision ofemptiness, the true nature of the blue in the sky, and they abide in thatstate of darkness.The Refutation of Arising from the Four Extremes—Section B 307Moon of Wisdom_3J* 6/30/09 10:13 AM Page 307"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- =, .0J- .%- .R/- $*A?, .%- 0R- /A,)A- v<- <2- <A2- 3,- ;A?- :$:- 8A$- 0- >.- ^- $*A?- .%- ,,k- L:A- 3.R%?- .%- 4%- 3- =- ?R$?- =R$- 0<- :6B/- LJ.- 0,, 105 !# $+A- 3$- $A- 1A2- .2%- $A?- .J- *A.- 3A- 3,R%- 2<- :I<- 2- =- <$- 3R., KA/- &A-=R$- +- )A- v<- 3,R%- 8J- /, 3- <A$- 0:A- .2%- $A?- .J- 3A/- =- .J- v<- $%- %R- 8J?-.0J:A- |R- /?- 2!/- 0- /A, )A- v<- <2- <A2- 3,- ;A?- <2- <A2- &/- :$:- 8A$- =-;R.- 0- 3A/- 0:A- 0- >.- .%- ^- $*A?- .%- k- L:A- 3.R%?- .%- 4%- 3- =- ?R$?- 0-i3?- 3- *J?- 0:A- <%- 28A/- ;A/- .- 9A/- G%- .%R?- 0R- *A.- .- =R$- 0<- :6B/- 0<-LJ.- 0- ;A/- /R,,$*A?- 0- /A, .J- 28A/- .- /A- $+A- 3$- *R/- IA- .2%- $A?- 3A- 3#?- 0?,,:.?- L?- v- 8A$- $- 5S$?- ]R- PR?- GA?- /A- gR$?- 0<- :I<,, 105 $%.0J- .J- 28A/- .- /A- :PR- 2- i3?- G%- $+A- 3$- $A- *R/- IA- .2%- $A?- <%- 28A/- 3-3,R%- !J, 3A- 3#?- 0?- 2?R.- /3?- .%- , 2?R.- /3?- 3A/- 0- .%- , 3A- $;R-2:A- =?- 2?$?- /?- :#R<- 2:A- $R.- 2&.- GA- :.?- L?- :.A- v- 8A$- $- 5S$?- 0-;R.- 0<- ]R- PR?- GA?- /A- gR$?- 0<- :I<- <R,,308The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_3J* 6/30/09 10:13 AM Page 308"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"2.3.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.2.Why there is no contradiction inperceiving non- things2.3.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.2.1.

Why there is no contradiction between the Middle Way and the Buddha’s statements2.3.1.1.1.2.1.2.2.2.2.1. Why there is no contradiction betweenthe Middle Way and logical reasoningJust as the identity of the child of a childless woman Arises neither in genuine nor worldly reality,So it is that all things do not arise in essence,Either genuinely or in the world. (111)Thus, there is no opportunity for you to challenge us, the proponents ofthe Middle Way, because we do not refute the arising of forms and soforth in genuine reality while asserting that they do inherently arise inrelative reality. For just as the identity of the child of a childless womandoes not arise either in reality’s precise nature, meaning genuine reality,or in worldly conventional reality, so it is that all things, forms and every-thing else, do not arise in essence either in genuine reality’s precise natureor in the relative reality of the world. This is the case because when oneanalyzes, one finds that both of the two truths transcend conceptual fab-rications. If something actually arose in essence, that would mean that its arisingwould not depend on conceptual mind, but rather, that it would arise byvirtue of its own specific characteristics. Such arising does not occur ineither of the two truths, because if all the causes and results of samsara’sbondage and nirvana’s liberation had any essence or nature of their own,they would not be created or made by anything, they would not dependon anything else, and they would not change into anything else.

(113)Our own Particularist (Vaibhashika) and Sutra (Sautrantika) schools9can-not challenge the Middle Way position by saying, “If things do not existin genuine reality, they necessarily must not exist conventionally either.”The reason for this is that the followers of these schools themselves assertthat vases, forests, and so forth are relative imputations, and therefore theydo not exist in the precise nature of genuine reality at the same time thattheir existence is renowned in the world. As is stated in the Abhidhar-makosha:10When things are destroyed or mentally dissected,Nothing remains for mind to know. Such things, like vases, water, and so forth, exist relatively,And what exists genuinely is something different.Thus, just as these schools assert coarse things to exist as conceptual impu-tations, so it is that when forms and all other things are analyzed they arefound not to exist, while at the same time from the perspective of howthings are renowned in the world—the unanalyzed, superficial way thingsseem to be—all these things appear. Therefore, that things do not exist inthe precise nature of reality does not mean that they are, like the child ofa childless woman, completely nonexistent in conventional reality as well.

(118ab)In his treatise on the Middle Way, the master Nagarjuna presented a vastand thorough analysis through the use of a great collection of logical rea-sonings. He did not do this out of a fondness for debate, or of putting oth-ers down. What was his motivation, then? It was the following aspiration:“Would it not be wonderful if through my presentation of this vast analy-sis that explains the precise nature, all wandering beings could realizeessential reality and gain their freedom!” Thus, he taught his treatise inorder to help ordinary individuals attain perfect liberation. 2.3.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.Rebutting opposing argumentsIf, however, when the precise nature of reality is perfectly explained,Other views collapse, there is no fault in that. (118cd)Someone may claim, “You refute all of your opponents’ analyses, and sinceyou debate with them in this way, you cannot posit the mere reversal ofconcepts as the only result of your treatise.”This statement is incorrect, because Middle Way analyses are not pre-sented for the purpose of debating others. However, no one could preventa rock mountain from being destroyed by an adamantine vajra, and simi-larly, when the precise nature of reality is perfectly explained by means oflogical analysis, if others are unable to prevent their views from collapsingbecause those views are illogical, we are not at fault.

[If this were the case,] the Teacher would not havesaid, “There was a period during which I was called ‘King Mandhatri’,”because that would involve asserting that the self of the king would havebeen destroyed, just as the body was, and that another body [and self ] wereproduced.

During a future birth, which comes after the self who was the previouskarmic agent would have disintegrated, the self who was the support [forthat future life] would no longer exist and, because of that, the actions sup-ported upon it as well as their consequences would not exist either, becausethe self would be just like the skandhas in that it too would be producedand then disintegrate and cease.Furthermore, the results of the karmic actions accumulated by onewould be experienced by another, because the results produced by actionsduring an earlier instant are experienced during a later, and the self of theearlier and later instants would be different; hence, what was gathered byone would be tasted by another. If the opponent concedes this point, itwould further mean that results of actions committed could get lost andresults of actions not committed could be encountered. To say this is to indicate that the Madhyamikas do not fall into theabsurdity in this proposition where it would be a different [producer ofthe] cause and [experiencer of the] result, because we make no claims what-soever with regard to the sameness or difference of the actions and theirresults, an earlier and later person, and so on.The Absence of Personal Self 357Moon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 357"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- /A, .J- *A.- .- o.- ;R.- /- *R/- 3J.- /,,}<- i3- .J.- 5K- o.- =- *J?- 2>.- 9A/,, 129 !#*R/- .J- 3A- :)$- !J, {.- &A$- }- KA:A- 2.$- $8/- ;A/- G%- o.- $&A$- 0:A- KA<-~3- /, .J- #R- /- *A.- .- o.- ;R.- 0<- I<- /, .J:A- *R/- 3J.- /- ;%- }<, L3?-0- *J<- &?- =- 2gJ/- (R?- i3?- /A, 8J?- ?R$?- ?- o.- =- i3- 0<- .J.- 5K- {.-&A$- }- KA- i3?- o.- $&A$- ;A/- 0- =- *J?- 0- 2>.- 9A/- +R,,$?3- 0- /A, .J- KA<- 1%- 0R- .%- ?J3?- 2.$- 3A- <A$?,, 129$<A$?- 0?- $/R.- 0- .J:A- KA<- 1%- 0R- i3?- .%- ?J3?- 2.$- ;A/- 0<- 3A- <A$?-?R,,$*A?- 0- /A, :)A$- gJ/- 3,:- w/- =- ?R$?- 3J.- KA<- <R,, 129 %?%?- o?- 0:A- #J- 0- .$- 2+R/- 0:A- =%- 3- 2!/- IA- v- 2- 2&- 28A- /A, :)A$-gJ/- 3,:- .%- w/- 3A- w/- ?R$?- 28A- .%- , :)A$- gJ/- g$- 3A- g$- ?R$?- 28A-.%- , .J- 28A/- $>J$?- 0- PR%?- 1/- (.- ;R.- 3J.- ?R$?- 28A- .%- , =?- YR$-$&A$- ,- ..- 0- =- 2gJ/- 0- $*A?- .%- 2&- 28A- 0R- :.A- /A- 3,:- $&A$- +- 5- 3A- /?-0?- 2&R3- w/- :.?- GA?- =%- 3- 2!/- 0<- i3- 0<- 28$- $R,, 358The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 358"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"[509] The second, the refutation of the response that attempts to disprovethis as a fallacyIf you say, “It is in fact a continuum and thus we are not in error,”Earlier analysis has shown the continuum to be faulty.

Their mere presence does not providethe experience of sweetness; whereas, if the hummingbird tastes the nec-tar, sweetness is experienced, but this does not reverse the craving for it.Similarly, merely seeing an imputed lack of self is not the realization of “noself.” The skandhas and so on are still mistakenly seen as a self, so desireand so on are not corrected.The Absence of Personal Self 365Moon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 365"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- =- KR$?- }- 3- 2eR.- 0- .%- , .J- .$- .$$- 0- $*A?, .%- 0R- /A, $%- KA<- !R/- 0?- 1%- 0R- 2.$- $R- 8J?,,$?%?- 0- .J- KA<- 1%- 0R- 2.$- :.R.- /,, 132 !##R- 2R- &$- =%- 5.- 3<- LJ.- 0?- gR$- $J:A- 5.- 3?- $/R.- 0- 3A/- 0- $%- $A- KA<- !R/-0?- .$J- aR%- %3- V3- 9J- $%- ?- .$- &A$- 2.$- $R- ~3- .- ;%- .$- 0<- eJ?- ?- v-2- .J- .$- /A- *J- 2<- =J/- 0:A- 1%- 0R- s- 0R- :.A- .$- #R- /- =- ;%- .$- 0<- eJ?- ?-2v:R,, 8J?- 1%- 0R- i3?- #R- /- 2.$- $R- 8J?- $?%?- 0- .J:A- KA<- 1%- 0R- 2.$-+- :.R.- &J- /, $*A?- 0- =, =%- $A- .$R%?- 0- 1%- 0R- 2.$- 3- ;A/, 1%- 0R- 2.$- ;A/- G%-5S$?- 0- 2.$- +- 3A- <%- , =J/- 0- 0R- *J<- =J/- .- 3A- <A$?- 0- .%- $?3, .%- 0R-=- 2!/- 2>.- $*A?, 366The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 366"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"The second, the refutation of what is given as a proof, has two parts:1) The statement of the opponent2) The refutation of that positionThe first of theseThe Teacher said, “The skandhas are the self,”So we assert the skandhas to be the self.

This isbecause he distinctly taught that what are imputed to be a self are the oper-ative phenomena comprising primary mind and mental factors—whichare based on the eighteen activities of mind: the six activities of a happymind, the six of an unhappy mind, and the six of indifference [all of whichThe Absence of Personal Self 379Moon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 379"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"*J- 2<- 29%- /?- 2.$- +- 2+$?- ?R- 8J?- %J?- 0<- $?%?- 0- .J:A- KA<, 2.$-.J- /A- (R?- .J- i3?- .%- $8/- 3A/- 0:A- .J- *A.- 3- ;A/- =, .J- .$- 5S$?- 43- *A.-G%- 3- ;A/- +J, (R?- .J- .$- 2.$- +- 3A- <%- 2- .J:A- KA<- (R?- .J- i3?- =- %<- :6B/-0:A- ]R- .J- <A$?- 0- 3A/- /R,, .J?- /- 1%- 0R- .%- .J- =?- $8/- .- %<- :6B/- IA- ;=-3- .3A$?- 0?- i=- :LR<- 0?- 2.$- .%- 2.$- $A- ;R.- 0- 3A/- 0<- >J?- /?- 1%-0R- s:A- o.- 2&.- /?- =J/- 0- 3J.- 0<- M%- :.?- ?- :I<- 2?- 2.$- 3J.- 0<-.J.- 0- :.A- (J?- 36K?- ?R,,$*A?- 0- =- :VJ=- 3J.- %%- $*J/- .- 3A- <A$?- 0- .%- , .J- .0J:A- |R- /?- 2?=- 2-$*A?, .%- 0R- /A, 2.$- 3J.- gR$?- 5K- g$- 0:A- 2.$- %R%- 8A%- ,,:.A- /A- %<- :6B/- gJ/- .:%- 3A- :.R.- 0,,.J- KA<- 2.$- 3J.- >J?- 0?- 2.$- v- 2,,.JA?- G%- :LA/- 8J?- 5- 2- >A/- +- 35<,, 140 2.$- 1%- $&A$- +- :6B/- &A%- KA?- 3,R%- =3- ,R2- 0- /- ;=- &/- %%?- >A%- ;=-3- %%?- 0<- :.R.- =, ;=- 3- ;A/- 0- 3- !J$?- 0:A- 2.$- %%?- 0<- 5- 2:A-3%- 2!<- 2- $%- $A- KR$?- .J- v<- /- )A- YA.- .- 1%- 0R- o/- 3- (.- 0- .J- YA.- .- %<-:6B/- :)$- !J, 2.$- :6B/- IA- $8A- 2.$- 2^R$- 0<- 3- L?- 0:A- KA<- +J, 1%-0R- .J- *A.- 2.$- ;A/- 0:A- KA<- 8J?- 2>.- 0- /A, i=- :LR<- 0?- 2.$- 3J.- gR$?-5K- 1%- 380The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 380"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"occur in relation to] the six objects (forms and so forth). Self is not iden-tical with29[each of ] these phenomena [separately], and yet it is not theirwhole collection either. These phenomena could, therefore, not be a selfand to conceive of them as being one is illogical.Thus, no objective grounding for the idea of “I” is ever observed,whether it be the skandhas or something other than them. For this reason,yogis understand that neither “I” nor “mine” exists. This in turn enablesthem to cut the continuum of the five skandhas and, in no longer incor-porating these, to attain nirvana. This is the great beauty of this analysisof the absence of self.[519] The second, a summary concluding this section by stating the con-sequence [that those who hold the Buddhist views just refuted30] do notabandon the view of self; this has two parts:1) The breach of logic involved in there being no connection between thefactor to be abandoned and its remedy2) Clarifying this point through an example The first of these“On realizing no self, clinging to permanent self is relinquished,” you say;But you do not even assert such a self to be the basis for notions of “I.”And therefore, to say that comprehending the lack of existence of such a selfFinally brings the view of self to an end, is quite an amazing statement! (140)There are those who assert that the one who conceives of “I” and the skan-dhas as being one and then later achieves the path of seeing has eliminatedthe subject but not its object. This corresponds to the position of the Sam-mitiyas, who claim that, [when the lack of self is realized,] what is elimi-nated is the [imputed] self posited by the Tirthikas, not its reference point,[the skandhas]. For as long as this is maintained, the continuum of theskandhas will remain uninterrupted. And for as long as that is so, the ideaof an “I” is maintained, because one has not corrected the [instinctive] ideaof self, which is the very basis of ego clinging; and that in turn is becauseone [still has the notion], “The skandhas are me.” The Absence of Personal Self 381Moon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 381"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"0R- =?- .R/- $8/- 0:A- g$- 0:A- 2.$- 3J.- >J?- 0?- 1%- 0R:C- ;=- &/- IA- 2.$- +-v- 2:A- ?- 2R/- .JA?- G%- :LA/- &J?- 5- 2- >A/- +- 35<- +J, 1/- 5/- :VJ=- 0-3J.- 0:A- KA<- +J, HR.- GA?- 1%- 0R- =?- .R/- $8/- .- 2+$?- 0:A- g$- 0:A- 2.$-%R%- 8A%- 3J.- 0<- :)A$- gJ/- $%- $A?- _R3- ;%- 1%- 0R- =?- .R/- $8/- g$- 0:A-2.$- :.A- /A- :)A$- gJ/- 0- i3?- GA- %<- :6B/- IA- gJ/- .:%- 3A- :.R.- 0?- :)A$-gJ/- 0?- %<- :6B/- IA- gJ/- .- I<- 0:A- 1%- 0R- =- 2.$- v- wR$- 0<- 3A- /?- 0- .J:A-KA<- <R,,$*A?- 0- /A, <%- HA3- lA$- 1$- 4=- $/?- 3,R%- 28A/- .,,:.A- /- \\%- (J/- 3J.- &J?- .R$?- 2?=- +J,,4=- IA- :)A$?- 0:%- %R%- 2<- LJ.- 0- /A,,GJ- 3- $8/- IA- $/3- 0R<- :I<- *A.- .R,, 141 .0J<- /- :$:- 8A$- $A?- <%- HA3- IA- lA$- 1$- /- 4=- $/?- 0- 3,R%- 28A/- .- :.A-/- \\%- 0R- (J- 3J.- &J?- 4=- IA- :)A$?- 0:A- .R$?- 0- 2?=- +J- 4=- IA- :)A$?-0:%- %R%- 2<- LJ.- 0- /A- GJ- 3- $8/- IA- $/3- 0R<- +J- .JR.- w/- .$- $A- 28.- $.-GA- $/?- ?- :I<- 2- *A.- .R- !J, .J- v<- 4=- 3J.- .R- 8J?- 2$- 1J2?- 0<- $/?-0:A- *J?- 2- .J- =- 4=- IA?- 9A/- /?- 3- <%- 2<- LJ.- 0- 28A/- g$- 2.$- wR$- G%-1%- 0R:C- ;=- &/- IA- 2.$- v- 3A- wR$- 0?- :#R<- 2- *A.- .- =?- *R/- IA?- :#R<-2<- :I<- <R,,382The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 382"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"In light of this explanation, to say that yogis and yoginis, on realizingthere is no self, comprehend that there is no [imputed] self that could bepermanent and have an existence extraneous to the skandhas and therebyutterly relinquish [the instinctive notion of “I,” namely] the view of selfthat derives from experiencing the skandhas, is quite an amazing state-ment, since the two are not connected.31Another reason for saying your statement is quite amazing is that foryou [realizing no self means] giving up the permanent self imputed [in thecontext of philosophical dialectic] to exist as a fact extraneous to the skan-dhas, and yet even you do not assert this permanent self with objective exis-tence separate from the skandhas, which is of no concern to beings in theirnatural setting, to be the basis for their [instinctive] notion of “me.” So[realizing there is no self separate from the skandhas] could not correct the[instinctive] view of self as being the skandhas, a view that is the basic ingre-dient of the notion of “I” entertained by beings in the world.[521] The second, clarifying this point through an exampleIt would be like saying that someone who sees that snakesAre nesting in a crack in a wall of their homeCould avoid any panic and cast off their fear of the snakesBy saying, “At least no elephants live in there!”I’m sorry, but people would find this rather amusing. (141)Take, for example, someone who has discovered that a hole in one of thewalls of their home is a snake’s nest and, to avoid panicking and to get ridof their fear of the snakes, says, “Well, at least there are no elephants inthere!” I’m sorry, but when others with a little common sense got word of this,they would find it rather amusing. And it would definitely not be the wayto get rid of the snakes so that the residents could rest assured they weregone.

If some self were to exist as a substantially con-stituted thing, it would necessarily be comparable to any other thing and,like mind in relation to body, its being the same as or different from otherthings would not be inexpressible.The Absence of Personal Self 391Moon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 391"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"$*A?- 0- /A, $%- KA<- HR.- 23- .%R?- 0R<- 3- P2- 0:A,,%R- 2R- $9$?- ?R$?- =?- 2eR.- 3J.- :I<- 2?,,2.$- $%- 1%- 0R- =?- 2eR.- 3J.- :I<- +J,,<%- $A?- ;R.- 0<- P2- 0<- gR$?- 3A- L,, 148 .J- *A.- .%- $8/- .- 2eR.- .- 3J.- /- 2+$?- ;R.- ;A/- +J, $%- $A- KA<- HR.- 23- 0-.%R?- 0R<- 3- P2- 0:A- 2+$?- ;R.- 43- ;A/- =, o- 35/- .J?- 23- 0:A- %R- 2R-$9$?- ?R$?- =?- .J- *A.- .%- $8/- 0<- 2eR.- .- 3J.- 0<- :I<- 2?- .J- 28A/- .-2.$- $%- 1%- 0R- =?- .J- *A.- .%- $8/- 0<- 2eR.- 3J.- .- :I<- +J, 2.$- <%- $A-%R- 2R- *A.- GA?- m?- ?- ;R.- 0<- :P2- 0<- 3A- L- 2<- 2+$?- ;R.- .- gR$?- 0:A- KA<, $?3- 0- /A, HR.- GA- i3- >J?- <%- 2.$- =?- $8/- /A,,3A- :.R.- $9$?- ?R$?- =?- $8/- .%R?- :.R.- &A%- ,,.%R?- =- i3- 0- .J- $*A?- 3,R%- :I<- 2,,.J- KA<- 2.$- 3J.- .%R?- (R?- .%- V=- KA<,, 149 HR.- GA- 2.$- m?- ;R.- i3- >J?- <%- $A- 2.$- *A.- =?- $8/- /A- 3A/- 0<- :.R.- =,$9$?- ?R$?- =?- $8/- IA- .%R?- 0R<- :.R.- 0- v<- 2.$- /A- <%- =?- $8/-3A/- &A%- , $8/- =?- ,- ..- 0<- :I<- 2:%- 3- ;A/- /R,, .J?- /- 2.$- /A- m?-?- 3J.- .J, .%R?- 0R:C- (R?- .%- V=- 2:A- KA<- +J, m?- ;R.- GA- .%R?- 0R- =- .J- .%-$8/- i3- 0- .J- $*A?- ?- 3,R%- 2<- :I<- 2- .J:A- KA<- 23- ?R$?- 28A/- /R,, 392The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 392"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"[527] The second, the presentation of self as an imputationFor you, a vase does not exist as a thing:Its essence cannot be expressed with respect to its form.So, if self cannot be expressed in terms of the skandhas,It cannot be understood to exist per se.

The reason is, its essential makeup would be inexpressible as beingthe same as or different from its form and so forth. And along these samelines, a self would be inexpressible as being the same as or different fromthe skandhas, because the self cannot be established as existing per se,40thatis to say, substantially, and must therefore be understood to be an impu-tation.The third, the impossibility of there being a self existing, due to its lack-ing the qualities of a thing Consciousness for you is not distinct from its own nature,And yet you assert it to be a thing which differs from form and so forth.A functional thing is observed to exhibit both of these properties;And therefore there is no self, since it lacks these qualities of a thing.

And, because of this, it is not supportedon something that arose in the bygone past.54As explained in the treatise[The Knowledge Fundamental to the Middle Way55]:To say it arose from something in the past56Is not a viable explanation;That which arose in bygone timesIs not the same as what’s here now.If you think it would be the same as itself,It would differ from what it incorporates.But, except for what it incorporates,What could your self possibly be?The Absence of Personal Self 419Moon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 419"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"}R/- 3- L%- 2- =?- L%- 2:A- 3A- 2gJ/- 0- *A.- G%- 3A/- +J, 2!/- 2&R?- =?,3- L%- 2- =?- L%- 3A/- +J,,:.A- =- *R/- .- ,=- 2<- :I<,,2.$- /A- L?- 0<- I<- 0:3,,:L%- 2- o- 3J.- &/- .- :I<,,8J?- ?R,,2.$- :.A- /A- *J- 2- .%- :)A$- 0- ;%- 3A/- +J,,*J- 2<- =J/- 0- 2.$- 3- ;A/,,.J- :L%- 2- .%- :)A$- 0- ;A/,,*J- 2<- ]%- 2- )A- v- 2<,,*J- 2<- =J/- 0R- ;A/- 0<- :I<,,8J?- ?R,, :.A- =- g$- 0- *A.- .%- 3A- g$- 0- =- ?R$?- 0- 28A- ;%- ;R.- 0- 3A/- +J,g$- .%- 3A- g$- =- ?R$?- 0,,8A- 2- :.A- =- $- =- ;R.,,3,:- .%- 3,:- 3J.- =- ?R$?- 0,,8A- 2- :.A- =- $- =- ;R.,,$%- $A?- .J- 28A/- $>J$?- ;R.- &J?,,:6B/- 0- !$- 0R?- 29%- I<- 0,,.J- /A- M- %/- :.?- 0- =,,3J.- &J?- i3- gR$- gR$- 0<- LJ.,,420The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_4J* 6/30/09 10:17 AM Page 420"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"The self is not something unsupported57either, that arose from somethingthat did not arise earlier.

[This idea, “mine,”is] applied to whatever comes under the jurisdiction of this “self ” or servesas a focal referent with respect to which the imputation of the self is enter-tained. This includes the eyes and so forth as interior possessions [of a sup-posed self ]. It also applies to whatever these experience, such as forms,sounds, and so forth, as the exterior [possessions].

(165)You might ask, “Why would it follow that, if there is no ‘I,’ there is no‘mine’ either?” Without a potter, a vase is not possible; i.e., without a cre-ating agent, there is no creation, because something is designated “a cre-ation” where there is a creating agent producing a frame of reference.58Andtherefore “mine” does not exist, because there is no “I” as the creatingagent. Because of this, the skandhas can be seen to be empty of an “I” and“mine.” When samsara is no longer what is seen, yogis and yoginis gainfull liberation. When forms and so forth are no longer the focus, attach-ment to them and other kinds of thoughts will not occur, and because ofthis, Shravakas and Pratyekabuddhas attain nirvana, where there is nograsping.

(169)If a result is inherently produced, is it produced through contact59[withits cause] or without contact with it? The first possibility is, as suggested here, that a cause produces a resultthrough merging with it. If that were the case, the cause and result wouldshare an identical factor,60like a river meeting an ocean, so there would beno difference in what you were calling the producing cause and the pro-duced result. And, if that were the case, the result would not be producedby the cause.If, on the other hand, causes and results did not meet like this but existedas separate, discrete [entities], either a result would not be produced (justlike the cause of rice, which has no connection with barley and does notproduce it as a result); or anything—regardless of whether it were a resultor not—could be produced by anything, regardless of whether it were itscause or not, because all would be equivalent in not linking up with eachother. There would, therefore, be no difference between what is or is nota cause. But this is not what you were proposing. But, were causes and results to exist with a makeup of their own, pro-duced and producer would have to either meet or not.

(180)The twenty types of emptiness mentioned here are all taught in the Sutraof Eight Chapters. Relying on that, Vimuktasena and the master Hari bha -dra list the types of emptiness as twenty. However, the Eight Thousand Verse[Prajnaparamita] and the tantras teach sixteen types of emptiness. Basedon that, Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremesand [Haribhadra’s]Digest of the Eight Thousand Verse Prajnaparamitaset the number of typesof emptiness at sixteen. In the Sutra of Many Chapters, [the Buddha] ini-tially teaches sixteen types of emptiness and again, separately, teaches four.According to Vimuktasena, Nodjom Khenpo, and others, these four areto be included within the sixteen. They consider them to be containedwithin the emptiness of an inherent essence in the nonexistence of enti-ties. Here, however, the master [Chandrakirti] sees the Buddha’s intentionin first explaining sixteen and then again four in the sutras as a way of firstgiving an expanded explanation and then a concise.The Sixteen Types of Emptiness 457Moon of Wisdom_5J* 6/30/09 10:19 AM Page 457"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"<2- :LR<- $8/- ;%- L%- (2- ?J3?- .0:A- ,J$- 0- (J/- 0R- /A-:.A- v- !J, /%- !R%- 0- *A.- .%- , KA- !R%- 0- *A.- .%- , KA- /%-!R%- 0- *A.- .%- , !R%- 0- *A.- !R%- 0- *A.- .%- , (J/- 0R- !R%- 0-*A.- .%- , .R/- .3- 0- !R%- 0- *A.- .%- , :.?- L?- !R%- 0- *A.-.%- , :.?- 3- L?- !R%- 0- *A.- .%- , 3,:- =?- :.?- 0- !R%-0- *A.- .%- , ,R$- 3- .%- ,- 3- 3J.- 0- !R%- 0- *A.- .%- , .R<- 2-3J.- 0- !R%- 0- *A.- .%- , <%- 28A/- !R%- 0- *A.- .%- , (R?-,3?- &.- !R%- 0- *A.- .%- , <%- $A- 35/- *A.- !R%- 0- *A.- .%-, 3A- .3A$?- 0- !R%- 0- *A.- .%- , .%R?- 0R- 3J.- 0:A- %R- 2R- *A.-!R%- 0- *A.- .R,8J?- 3R?- 0- .%- 2&?- 0<- !R%- 0- *A.- 2&- S$- +- 2>.- /?, <2- :LR<- $8/- ;%- .%R?- 0R- /A- .%R?- 0R?- !R%- %R- , .%R?- 0R-3J.- 0- /A- .%R?- 0R- 3J.- 0?- !R%- %R- , <%- 28A/- /A- <%- 28A/-IA?- !R%- %R- , $8/- IA- .%R?- 0R- /A- $8/- IA- .%R?- 0R?- !R%- %R-,8J?- 3.R<- 2#?- +J- a<- ;%- !R%- *A.- 28A<- 2>.- &A%- , !R%- *A.- *A- >- 0R- .J- .$-/A- ,J$- (J/- IA- =3- .- 28J.- 0- ;A/- +J, >J?- 1A2- GA- $*J/- 0R<- (R?- GA- 2.$- 3J.-o?- 0<- 2!/- 0- ;A/- 0:A- KA<,458The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_5J* 6/30/09 10:19 AM Page 458"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"The following is presented in the Ashtadashasahasrikaprajnaparamita -sutra:Subhuti, you of perfect resources!

The same empty nature is valid for the ears and the nose, for thetongue and body and also for mind.

It isneither present in a lasting fashion nor does it perish and, therefore, it is theemptiness of what is called the imperceptible.The Sixteen Types of Emptiness 503Moon of Wisdom_5J* 6/30/09 10:20 AM Page 503"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"2&- S$- 0- /A, nJ/- =?- L%- KA<- .%R?- i3?- =,,:.?- 0- 0- ;A- %R- 2R- 3J.,,:.?- 0- 0- /A- .J- *A.- GA?,,!R%- *A.- .%R?- 3J.- !R%- *A.- .R,, 218o- .%- nJ/- =?- L%- 2:A- KA<- .%R?- 0R- i3?- =- :.?- 0- =?- L%- 2:A- 5S$?- 0:A-%R- 2R- 3J.- =, :.?- 0- =?- L%- 2- .J- /A- *A.- GA- <%- %R?- !R%- 0- *A.- /A- .%R?- 0R- 3J.-0:A- %R- 2R- *A.- !R%- *A.- .R,,$*A?- 0- =- .%R?- 0R- .%- , .%R?- 0R- 3J.- 0- .%- , <%- $A- %R- 2R- .%- , $8/- IA- %R-2R- !R%- 0- *A.- .%- 28A:A,.%- 0R- /A, .%R?- 0R:C- 1?- /A- 3.R<- 2#?- /,,1%- 0R- s- i3?- 2eR.- 0- ;A/,,.J- i3?- .J- ;A?- !R%- *A.- $%- ,,.J- .%R?- !R%- 0- *A.- .- 2>.,, 219 .%R?- 0R- 8J?- L- 2:A- 1- /A- 3.R<- 2#- /- 1%- 0R- s- 0R- i3?- =- 2eR.- 0- ;A/- IA, .J-i3?- .J:A- !R%- *A.- $%- ;A/- 0- .J- /A- .%R?- 0R- !R%- 0- *A.- .- 2>.- .R,,504The Moon of WisdomMoon of Wisdom_5J* 6/30/09 10:20 AM Page 504"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"16)The emptiness of an inherent essence in the nonexistence of entitiesSince entities arise from causes and conditions,They are assembled and lack essential makeup.That which is assembled is empty of being just thatAnd this is the emptiness of the nonexistence of entities.

For example, “hot and burning” are the defining char-acteristics to which the name “fire” is given. 6 This means that all phenomena are naturally peace—open, spacious, and relaxed.7 Meaning that phenomena’s true nature cannot be conceived of as existent, nonexist-ent, permanent, extinct, something, nothing, or any other label that thoughts can fab-ricate. 8 The reflection of the moon appearing in a pool of water.9 The sixth bodhisattva ground has two names: the Manifest and, as appears above inverse 1, the Approach.10 Since this ancillary explanation is not a commentary on any specific root verse, it is nottranslated here.11 The Samkhyas, or Enumerators, are an Indian non-Buddhist philosophical school. 12 Pervasionis a technical term of Buddhist logic. If there is pervasion in a logical reason-ing, it means that a certain consequence necessarily follows from the reason given. Forexample, in the statement “Where there is smoke, there is fire” pervasion exists, but inthe statement “Where there is smoke, there is a sandalwood fire” there is no pervasion.Here specifically, the Middle Way points out that since a sprout that arose from itselfwould be arising from a sprout that already existed in the seed, at the same time, theseed should also arise again from itself. That the Samkhyas might accept the reason butnot the pervasion, the necessity of this consequence, means that they might accept thatthe sprout arises again from the sprout that existed in the seed, but not the consequenceof that belief, which would be that the seed would also arise again. 13 Meaning that the Samkhya School does not accept that if things arose from themselves,it necessarily follows that causes would arise again and again until the end of existence.14 The Tibetan literally translated reads, “Therefore that cause destroys the seed and thesprout comes into being.” However, Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche explains that theTibetan rgyu, translated as “cause,” should be read as rgyu mtshan, meaning “reason,”and the reason refers to the sprout itself.15 The Vaisheshikas, or Differentialists, are an Indian non-Buddhist philosophical school.16 Not translated here.17 The four conditions that appear to come together and produce a result in conventionalreality are: the causal condition, the empowering condition, the focal condition, andthe immediately preceding condition. In the case of an instant of eye-sense-conscious-518The Moon of WisdomMoon_NotesJ* 6/30/09 10:47 AM Page 518"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"ness, its causal condition is a preceding moment of consciousness, its immediately pre-ceding condition is the cessation of that preceding moment of consciousness, its focalcondition is the object perceived by the eye-sense-consciousness, and its empoweringcondition is the eye-sense-faculty.18 The Particularist School (Sanskrit: Vaibhashika) is a Buddhist philosophical tenetsystem.19 This treatise is Nagarjuna’s Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way.20 A tirthika is someone who desires liberation and uses reasoning to analyze the natureof phenomena in search of it, but who does not use proper analysis or come to an accu-rate understanding. See shes bya kun khyab mdzod, The Treasury Which is an Encyclo-pedia of Knowledge, Padma Karpo Translation Committee electronic edition (Nepal,2000), vol. 2, pp. 168-169.21 According to Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, the two types of ignorance are “afflictedignorance,” corresponding to the afflictive obscurations (nyon mongs pa’i sgrib pa), and“unafflicted ignorance,” corresponding to the cognitive obscurations (shes bya’i sgribpa). 22 This is the logical reasoning that Nagarjuna uses to prove that the eyes and the othersense faculties do not truly perceive outer objects in The Fundamental Wisdom of theMiddle Way, Chapter 3, verse 2: “The seer does not see itself. How could that whichdoes not see itself ever see something else?”If the seeing eye were truly existent, it would have to exist independent of causesand conditions. It would therefore exist independent of there being a focal conditionof any outer object to see. If that were the case, the eye would have to see itself. Sinceit does not see itself, however, its seeing exists only in dependence upon causes and con-ditions, and therefore it does not truly see anything else. 23 The next three verses (34-36) are Chandrakirti’s refutation of “validly established con-ventional reality” (tha snyad tshad grub). Those who believe in validly established con-ventional reality assert that relative phenomena have objective existence; that theyvalidly exist from their own side, by virtue of their own specific characteristics. Chan-drakirti shows how this is not the case; he demonstrates that phenomena in relativereality have no valid, objective existence, but are merely conceptual projections, justlike phenomena in dreams.For Khenpo Rinpoche’s extensive explanation of these three verses, please see “Likea Dream,” Bodhi Magazine, Volume 6, Issue 3 (December 2003), pp. 14-25and pp. 40-43.24 Khenpo Rinpoche explains that this reason could alternatively be read to mean,“because he described it in the way that he did in order to get his disciples to enter intothe true nature of all things.”Notes to Part II1In preparing this translation, I have relied primarily upon the edition of Karmpa MikyöDorje’s commentary that was published by the Sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa,Rangjung Rigpe Dorje.

The numbers given with the headings indicate thecorresponding page in the edition published by the Sixteenth Karmapa.Khenpo Rinpoche asked that we translate only those portions of Mikyö Dorje’scommentary that bear directly upon Chandrakırti’s verses. For that reason, I have omit-ted the Karmapa’s discussion of other topics, however interesting they may be. A noteat the end of each section identifies the point at which the translation begins and alsothe point at which it ends.

Chandrakırti puts it this way:A rope can be mistaken for a snake; without the contingent reason, this wouldbe unsuitable. Earth and so forth can be mistaken for a vase; without the con-tingent reason—earth and so forth—such would not arise with respect to theelement of space.This comment appears in Chandrakırti’s Explanation of the “Entrance to the Mid-dle Way”at 88:7-89:1 of the edition published by the Sixteenth Karmapa. In MikyöDorje’s commentary, I now move from 411:3 to 412:2, omitting the intervening lines.6412:2-37413:2-48413:5-69415:3-510415:5-416:411419:4-612420:1-313422:5-423:114423:2-415This refers to the reason that concludes the previous section: “This is because, in theabsence of an object, a cognition possessing an object is not established.”16This refers to the consequence that Chandrakırti has just drawn from the assertion ofcognition in the absence of objects, which can be stated in this way: It follows that thosewhose eyes are not affected by disease would also see strands of hair.17423:4-618424:1-419424:4-5520The Moon of WisdomMoon_NotesJ* 6/30/09 10:47 AM Page 520"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"20424:5-425:221425:4-522425:5-426:223426:2-524426:5-427:125Both Chandrakırti’s verse and Mikyö Dorje’s commentary emphasize that the two con-sciousnesses are mutually other, and they do so by qualifying each consciousness as“other” in relation to the “other” consciousness. In English, this sounds odd. Reluc-tant to modify the texts that I am translating, I have stayed with the letter of the orig-inal, despite the awkward and potentially confusing result. The meaning of the passagemay be expressed in a simpler form: If a consciousness arises from the energy of anotherconsciousness, then it arises from what is other than itself.

Its proponents assert that the physicalelements are the causes of consciousness and everything else constituting sentientbeings. The Charvakas therefore do not assert past and future lives or karmic causesand results, because they claim that when sentient beings are born, they simply arisenaturally from a combination of the elements, and when they die, this combination ofthe elements falls apart, and they dissolve back into nothingness.From the Middle Way’s perspective, this assertion that the mind arises anew fromthe elements is an assertion of causeless arising, because it is an assertion that the firstmoment of mind in the present life is not preceded by its cause—the last moment ofmind in the past life.6 In other words, the Charvakas believe that future lifetimes do not exist because whenthe truly existent physical body that they posit ceases to exist, that cessation is final andabsolute, and so at the same time that this occurs, the consciousness that they claimarises from the body also experiences a complete and final cessation. As the Middle Waypoints out, however, the physical body does not truly exist, nor does it truly arise orcease. Rather, it is a dependently arisen mere appearance, and, therefore, the causes forthe appearance of a physical body are freely able to come together in all future lifetimesto come.Thus it is not the Middle Way proponents of emptiness who are nihilists, but ratherthe Charvakas who are, because they assert that this physical world truly exists now,and after it ceases, there is nothing. Since the Middle Way, in contrast, describes appear-ances as dependently arisen and empty of inherent nature, appearance-emptinessundifferentiable, the Middle Way transcends both extremes of permanence and extinc-tion (see verse 33). 7 In other words, this conclusion that things would be nonexistent conventionally doesnot necessarily follow from the fact that they do not truly exist.8Ratna-megha-sutra, dkon mchog sprin gyi mdo9 Both the Particularist and Sutra schools are Buddhist philosophical tenet systems;specifically, they belong to the Shravaka Vehicle. 10A Treasury of Abhidharma(Tibetan: chos mngon pa mdzod) by Vasubandhu (Tibetan:dbyig gnyen) Notes to Part III 523Moon_NotesJ* 6/30/09 10:47 AM Page 523"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"Notes to Part IV1This bracketed number refers to the page number of the Tibetan text used (see Trans-lators’ Preface, n. 4), as do all of the following that occur throughout this section of thetext at regular intervals as left-hand line headings, from [499] to [572].

The self is the one who experiences what prakriticreates.8For example, that the self is described by the Samkhyas as being inactive does not cor-respond to the instinctive notion of self.9These two lines of verse in Tibetan expand to four lines of verse in English.10“Some of our own systems” means some Buddhist schools, in this case the Sammitiya,mang pos bkur ba, one of the eighteen Vaibhashika schools of the Hinayana. Theseeighteen can be categorized in terms of four main schools, one of which is the Sammi-tiya. 11“Primary mind,” gtso sems, means the sixfold collection of consciousness, the five sen-sory and the rational. The school referred to here is still the Sammitiya, some of whomsay that all five skandhas are the basis for the view of self, others that only the skandhaof consciousness, or primary mind, is such a base. 12Even though these three subdivisions are not listed in this edition of the EighthKarmapa’s commentary, later numbering in the outline of this work and the inclusionof these three in Rendawa’s commentary strongly indicate their presence in an earlieredition. They have, therefore, been included here.

In Mikyö Dorje’s commentary it is phung po ‘di(“theseskandhas”). The translation here follows the former version.15In other words, the self would be just as perceptible to an eye consciousness as the colorblue. 16This refers to the Vatsiputriyas; see n. 19.17I.e., during the first turning of the wheel of Dharma.524The Moon of WisdomMoon_NotesJ* 6/30/09 10:47 AM Page 524"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"18The “others” here refers to non-Buddhists who claim the self to be an internal agentthat is different from the skandhas.19The Vatsiputriya, gnas ma bu, is one of the eighteen schools of the Vaibhashika and asubschool of the Sammitiya (see n. 10). Some of the essentials of their position emergein the following pages.20I.e., the relationship imagined between self and skandhas.21A kindred cause, nye bar len pa’i rgyu, is one whose result is the “same continuum ofthe same substance,” rdzas gchig rgyun gchig; e.g., a sprout belongs to the continuumof the seed and is of the same substance. In other words, the sprout and seed are of thesame nature or makeup, in that the seed is the material out of which the sprout is made.The point here is that skandhas and self could not be of the same essential makeup,because they do not involve this type of cause-effect relationship. 22Chags pa, translated “manifesting as”; it seems the term could not here have its othermain sense of “desiring,” because, for a self to desire a form, it would have to be differ-ent from the form, but that was what was refuted by the earlier sutras. The point hereis the refutation of self as identical with the skandhas. 23A collection does not exist substantially but only as a generalization expressed underone name.24The term ming bzhi,here translated as “the... four [operations providing the namesof things] referred to as ‘the naming-skandhas,’ ” is equivalent to ming gzhi‘i phung po,which occurs in the commentary to verse 144, there translated as “the skandhas whichare bases for naming.” See n. 35.25This point traces back to the outline preceding verse 127. It means, as indicated in thecommentary to verses 138 and 139, that self is an imputation relative to the dhatus,ayatanas, and eighteen activities of mind which the Buddha is here cited as equatingwith the person. This point is taken up again in the outline preceding verse 150d, whereit is elaborated on in much greater detail.26Since the root text translation has been rendered in meter, it sometimes exhibits theterseness typical of metrical expression. Brevity has been taken to such lengths in theoriginal Sanskrit works and their Tibetan translations that they are virtually, and some-times entirely, unintelligible without the commentaries. A similar degree of brevity hasnot been adopted in the English translation of the root text here, but some clarifica-tion of syntax may occasionally be required.The first two lines of verse 139 state the reason for the statement made in 138, whichexplains why 138 ends with a comma. To paraphrase these six lines, the Buddha taughtthat the “self” is just a name applied to the six capacities and six supports for contact,since he clearly taught that it, i.e., the idea of self, comes from apprehending the phe-nomena of mind and mental events. 27Sutra of the Meeting of Father and Son (Pitiputrasamigama-sutra; yab dang rsas mjal ba’imdo).28Sanskrit, dhatu; Tibetan, khams; “elements” or, more specifically, “potentials,” or, asin this verse of root text, “capacities.”29“Not identical with,” lit. “not something that is not different from.”30This point, with its two subdivisions, concludes the section refuting the position thatthe skandhas literally comprise a self. “The Buddhist views just refuted” refers to thevarious ways the skandhas are held to be a self, as described and refuted in this section.Notes to Part IV 525Moon_NotesJ* 6/30/09 10:47 AM Page 525"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"31In other words, realizing that there is no self as self is defined in non-Buddhist schoolsof philosophy cannot eliminate the instinctive idea of self, since the latter is not pro-duced by the former. 32“Body,” gzugs, lit. “form.”33I.e., it would not make sense here to speak of “having,” since the two would be one andthe same thing.34In this context, one could take the body of someone as exemplifying “the objectobserved”; and thinking it is a self, that there is a self that possesses it, etc. are the ideasone has about it. 35This term,ming gzhi’i phung po, “the skandhas which are bases for naming,” is synony-mous with the four mental skandhas: feeling, discrimination, karmic formation, andconsciousness.36“Agent,” byed po, also translates as “creator,” depending on context. 37In brief, as Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche summarized it, “The Vatsiputriyas say that,although the self cannot be expressed, it is substantially existent because all of its sub-stantial functions can be seen.” 38“This person is not actually perceptible itself,”gang zag de rang gi ngo bos shes bya min,translates more literally as “this person is not knowable by way of its own essence.” Theinexpressible person described in this verse is essential to personal self as defined by theVatsiputriyas. 39The Tibetan for “knowable” or “object of knowledge” is shes bya, which more literallymeans “an object of consciousness.” The same term is also translated here as “percep-tible.” 40“Per se,” rang gi ngo bo nyid kyis, translated literally as “by virtue of its very own essence.”41This traces back to the extensive section of outline preceding verse 121.42Of the three main points comprising this entire subject, the absence of personal self,this is the third. See outline preceding verse 120. 43“Function,” bya, can alternatively be translated as “the action performed.”44“A whole,” yan lag can, lit. “part possessor.”45This means that the two preceding points, the refutation of the parts and the refuta-tion of the proposition that there could be a whole without parts, are both includedunder the two points that follow, namely, the refutation of the mere collection and thegeneral refutation of the shape. A separate explanation of the second point, the refuta-tion of a whole without parts, is nevertheless given below.46This is another way of saying “the refutation of the whole,” as is borne out by verse152cd.47Here, “whole” is tshogs pa can, lit. “the possessor or bearer of the collection.”48This is a reference to the Vaibhashika system, which claims the true existence of theouter, physical world by positing the existence of rdul rdzas brgyad, here translated as“eight-particle substances.” Although each of the eight particles is claimed by propo-nents of this school to be partless, they further state that wherever one of the eight ispresent, all eight are automatically present, forming a gong bu, a globule or atomic unitsaid to be the gzhi or basis of all matter experienced in the desire realm. Though each526The Moon of WisdomMoon_NotesJ* 6/30/09 10:47 AM Page 526"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"of the eight is said to be partless, these eight are nevertheless said to comprise the partsof the globule. The internal contradictions in this position are exposed and the basicposition refuted in various ways by higher schools, but here the Madhyamikas, repre-sented by Chandrakirti, refute any supposed true existence of such a basic atomic unitby referring to the seven-point analysis. That is to say, the same argument that appliesto a carriage and its parts would apply equally to a globule and its parts, thus exclud-ing any substantial existence of either, leaving both with mere imputed existence. 49To restate the argument here briefly, since parts and a whole and so forth only exist rel-ative to each other, it would be illogical to claim that the parts exist but the whole doesnot. For the same reason, to demonstrate the lack of substantial existence of the wholeis to demonstrate the lack of substantial existence of the parts. Other reasons for thenonexistence of both have also been presented above. Nevertheless, to indiscriminatelyproclaim this lack of existence, which is in contradiction to common consensus, is ill-advised, due to the risk of generating nihilistic views. 50I.e., the parts, when analyzed with prajna, would be detectable as existing with a sub-stantial makeup of their own, but that is not the case.51That is to say, without the whole there would be no parts.52This traces back to the section of outline preceding verse 151.53An alternate translation of “supported and unsupported” as used here would be “sta-ble and unstable.”54Alternatively, “And because of this, it is not something stable that arose in the bygonepast.”55This refers to Nagarjuna’s major text (Mulamadhyamakakarika, rtsa ba’i shes rab), ofwhich our present work is a commentary. It is referred to above as The Treatise on theMiddle Wayand elsewhere as The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way. Any cita-tion in this work that quotes “the treatise” refers to this text.56Alternatively, “To say that it arose in the past....” 57Alternatively, “The self is not something unstable either.”58The “frame of reference,” ‘jug yul,for a farmer is a field with its soil, seeds, moisture,fertilizer, warmth, etc. Given that as the frame of reference, or environment, the farmercan produce a crop. When the skandhas, with their consciousnesses, faculties, objectsof consciousness, etc., are thought of as “mine,” they are the‘jug yul, or frame of refer-ence with respect to which the “I” creates “mine.”In other contexts, such as that of inferential valid cognition,‘jug yul translates as“object of engagement” or “engaged object.” When smoke is seen, one infers fire. Here,fire is the object engaged or referred to, i.e., experienced, through the medium of infer-ence.Considering both of these cases together, ‘jug yulapplies both to the object engagedand the medium or environment through which it is engaged. 59The Tibetan here is phrad, which literally means “to meet” or “make contact.” Theterm, however, is used throughout the following verses with a variety of meanings, notall of which translate idiomatically with either of these terms. Here, for example, theargument is that cause and result, to be tenable, must either merge (lit. “meet”) in thesense of having some common meeting ground, some shared identical factor, or not.They are demonstrated to do neither and this is how the process of cause and effect ishere invalidated as having any substantial existence.Notes to Part IV 527Moon_NotesJ* 6/30/09 10:47 AM Page 527"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"60“Identical factor,” nus pa gcig pa, more literally translates as “same potential.”61The criterion for a necessary meeting or lack of it would only apply where true exis-tence is being asserted for the refutation and what is being refuted, or any other pair offactors. Since the Madhyamikas do not assert this, the consequence mentioned doesnot apply to them. 62I.e., by the sun’s literally coming down into the water.63An example of their being out of touch due to some other substance would be a bodyof water covered by clouds or a container of water covered by a lid. If the reflectioncould occur without sun and water meeting, it could occur in such cases. 64This means that, although reasoning belongs strictly to conventional truth that accordswith common consensus at the unexamined level, it is able to refute and eliminatewrong views and afford correct understanding of the subject under investigation. 65“Others” here refers to the Madhyamikas, whose views are “other” than those of theProponents of Truly Existent Things, or Realists.66In certain cases, a proof is established on the basis ofrtags, “evidence,” also translatedas “sign.” “And so on” refers to the other types of reasons that can constitute a proof.Notes to Part V1This corresponds to section 2.3.1.2 in the outline given near the beginning of Part I ofthis book.2This corresponds to section 2.3.2 in the outline.3Here Mikyö Dorje is criticizing the Jonangpas for clinging to the concept of the bud-dha nature as the emptiness that is the true nature of reality, and the Gedenpas forclinging to the concept of a nonaffirming negation as the emptiness that is the truenature of reality. By asserting the existence of emptiness, Mikyö Dorje claims, thesetwo schools miss the point of this fourth of sixteen emptinesses, which is that empti-ness itself is also empty of any essence; that emptiness itself is empty of being able tobe described by any concept of what it might be.4Rinpoche explains that “the direct access to everything possible” means “the directknowledge of everything possible.” 5The definition of form, Tibetan gzugs, is here translated very literally, but could alsobe translated “anything taking physical appearance.” In general, “form” refers eitherto the skandha of form, the physical world, or to the outer ayatana of form, any objectfor an eye consciousness. In the first case, “form” covers the five senses and their objects:the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, forms, sounds, smells, tastes and bodily sensations.However, since the Sautrantika School defines a variety of phenomena, vows for exam-ple, as being physical entities which enter and make up the body, the more literal trans-lation has been chosen.6In Chandrakirti’s autocommentary, “ the entity that is otherwise” is “other” in that itis 1) always existing; 2) that which is realized by wisdom; and 3) transcending samsara.Relative phenomena are none of these things.7This corresponds to major point 3 in the outline at the very beginning of Part I of thisbook.528The Moon of WisdomMoon_NotesJ* 6/30/09 10:47 AM Page 528"}]
