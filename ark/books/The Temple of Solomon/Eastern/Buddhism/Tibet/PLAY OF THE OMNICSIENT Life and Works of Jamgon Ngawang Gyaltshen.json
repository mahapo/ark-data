They serve as role models for our spiritual work, and spur us on to make greater efforts than might generally result from our reading a moral dissertation or hearing a sermon. They show us that it is the actions of such saints - that is, the practical applications of their theoretical principles - that prove the truth of their teachings. Such is the case with the biography of the Drukpa master Jamgon Ngawang Gyaltshen (1647-1732). It depicts the socio-religious milieu of our country in his time, his spiritual pursuit, and his ultimate triumph of attaining enlightenment. Sakya Rinchen's biography of this great Drukpa master, composed largely in collaboration with the subject during his lifetime, is a seminal reference source for religious and social historians. However, being written in the language and style of the period, its readership is somewhat limited nowadays. The National Library is to be praised for choosing Jamgon's life and work as a research topic and for bringing out such a new and reader-friendly translation of this important work.

The plethora of footnotes attest to the high level of scholarship of the authors, who seem to have left no stone unturned in seeking out and explaining details of Jamgon's interesting life. This new book makes a significant contribution to meeting the growing need for further and accessible reference materials on our history, culture and traditions. Accordingly, I commend this work to all Bhutanese seeking to know more of their country's history, both as seekers of general knowledge and - more particularly -as students of Bhutanese history. It may be especially valuable to Bhutan's younger generation who have been raised in such a very different world from that of their elders.

Whether in the field of Buddhist scholasticism, or in that of esoteric ritualism and devotional liturgy, or in arts and crafts, Drukpa School masters have regularly emerged as outstanding masters, earning great fame and reputation not only within Bhutan but also beyond its borders. One such master is jamgon Ngawang Gyaltshen (1647-1732), a most important religious figure in the history of 17th and 18th century Bhutan. His life and work was chosen as a research topic under the joint research programme between the National Library of Bhutan and The Royal Library of Denmark within the framework of \"Institutional Strengthening of the National Library of Bhutan.\" The present study remained a work in progress for much longer than its authors would have wished, due in large part to the wide scope of the subject matter and also to the authors' other professional commitments at their respective places of work. Now it is with great pleasure that they present the results of their years of research in this modest book, entitled \"Play of the Omniscient. \" We have incurred debts of gratitude from numerous spiritual luminaries and scholars not only in Bhutan, but also abroad -Derge (Kham) and Ladakh, along the trail we followed in order to trace vestiges of this great historical figure or offered other vital leads. Among them, foremost, we thank the following key persons related to the Project: Stig T.

We deeply appreciate their continuing support and enthusiasm for our wor~ despite its sluggish progress, and we express our hemtfelt gratitude for their patience. We must also express warmest gratitude to our former Minister for Home and Cultural Affairs, Jigmi Y. Thinley who gave us unstinting support and encouragement during the process of our research. We initially planned to bring out this book during his tenure, but unfortunately were unable to do so. Similarly, we express gratitude to Dasho Penden Wangchuk, Secretary for Home and Cultural Affairs for his support and interest in this project. Abroad, we owe debts of gratitude to Khenpo Kalden Tshering, abbot of Lhiindrubteng Monastery in Derge (Kham) and to a Khenpo at Changra Monastery, Derge who provided guidance and help during our visit to Derge. Indispensible was the help received from His Eminence the 4th Takna Rinpoche, Ngawang Donyod Dorje, head of the Southern Drukpa Kagyud in Ladakh, who shared his precious time with us at his wonderful sanctuary, Tiger's Nose Monastery (Takna Gonpa) in Ladakh. His Eminence most patiently answered our numerous queries and also generously permitted us to photograph several of his antiquities during our visit to Ladakh. Besides, numerous other anonymous monks unstintingly provided help for which we now express our gratitude. At home, we owe special thanks to His Eminence Triilku Mipham Chokyi Nyinjed (the 6th Amorimu chOje) and to Khenpo Karma Tshering, the former principal of Seula Shedra for permitting us to make two visits to their ancestral monastic seat of Seula ChOkhor Dorjeden, and for their unflagging interest in our research topic.

We must also thank two internationally known Tibetologists with a continuing interest in Bhutanese culture, John Ardussi and Fran~oise Pommaret, for their interest in our chosen subject, and for their continued support and encouragement. Many pictures have been incorporated in order to add life to the book. Most of the pictures, however, were taken \"on the run\" by the researchers themselves as they journeyed (within time limits imposed by other commitments) throughout parts of western and central Bhutan while searching out materials related to Jamgon's name and activities. We must also sincerely thank Zoe N. Cheung for setting many things right in earlier drafts of this work. Most of all, many thanks to Felicity Shaw for her meticulous proof reading and copy editing of the final draft, and for compilation of a glossary to assist the readers. For remaining typos and mistakes, the authors hold full responsibility. Until now nothing about the life and works of this great spiritual luminary has been published with full research.

Importance of the Subject The biographies of saints and great masters are principally designed to serve as sources of inspiration and imitation. The very name of the genre for biographies in indigenous Tibetan and hence also Bhutanese literature is an indication of this: they are generally called namthar (or poetically rtogs brjocl), literally \"complete liberation\" (vimok~a), essentially providing the potential readers and devout followers with an inspirational guide to be followed for achieving ideal conduct of life. In content, they were life blueprints to be followed by the readers, with the central characters of such narratives being true spiritual role models. By nature, such narratives often were designed to instruct and uplift the reader morally or intellectually (principally morally) but they are quintessentially immensely imaginative and allusive. Such biographies were most often compiled for ideological or pious reasons. They should never be regarded as critical discourses which might be subjected to any overly critical-analytic mode. They depict the worldly or supramundane struggles and ultimate victory of a selective group of persons whose individual lives were, for various reasons,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2 Play of the Ominiscient considered worthwhile or essential to narrate. But these were never· stories or narratives for the sake of the story alone. Influenced by the sensibilities of the era and the political conditions prevailing ai the time of compilation, the saintly portraits -the word hagiographies is often used - thus remain selective reconstructions or subjective filterings of past events. Mostly ideologically tainted, and limited in time, scope and concept, they allow the reader or researcher ample space to question and to inquire into the motives behind the compilation of such works. Looking further into the narrative writings of the Bhutanese world, it can also be maintained that entire narrative settings and plots encountered in the kindred literature are reminiscent of similar narratives that commonly vex medievalists of European or East-Asian historiography when confronted with historical events of the past, where modes of perception and techniques of argumentation in retelling the past often differ from contemporary conventions and norms. Historical narratives and episodes conveyed and transmitted in written sources often remain contextually or culturally incomprehensible to an outsider. Bhutanese historical and biographical narratives . (and doubtless the written traditions of other cultures) contain numerous examples of the transformative power of rituals that interacted with politics within an historical context. These often imply the involvement of cultural symbols and signs - in other words the language of rituals - which were not insignificant for the establishing and consolidation of dominance. It is commonly argued that the true hallmark of power is the construction of reality, and on this account rituals here become all the more important. Throughout most of its first three hundred years, Bhutanese society remained unstable politically. With shifting political alliances, numerous symbols and human symbolic acts took on diverse or ambiguous meanings, on account of the changing nature of society or due to revalidated identities. In Bhutan (as in Tibet) political actions were highly ritualized and MaI).ipulative, and their implementation remained essential for the functioning of the tiered, hierarchical order of society."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction 3 Biographical writing, like the historiographical geme, broadly defined, commonly draws a fundamental distinction between objective history, that is, as it was or as it happened (\"the facts\") and the subsequent subjective historical reconstruction of these events conducted by historians and biographers, or in other words, the facts as historical events vis-a-vis the reconstruction of those events of the remote or recent past. History as concept encompasses both modalities. The attempted construction of what constitutes historical meaning and sense and its interpretation, moreover, operate within the spheres of both \"the facts\" and later reconstruction of the events, with the latter's immensely broader operational domain. A proper historical narrative mode commonly attempts to deal with the former, and the non-historical imaginative narrative (including gemes such as legend and myth) with the latter. However, the blurred distinction between the two often constituted the context within which most historical narration evolved or was transmitted. The narrative mode regularly dominates much historiographical and biographical writing. It essentially focuses on a traditional retelling or portrayal of a story or successive stories, for instance such ones that delineate the genealogy and legitimacy of a person or entire families and clans, and thus often providing the rationale behind such legitimacy. The exemplary mode also is documented in many historical and biographical materials, where events are mostly represented in an imaginative and allusive style in conformity with the celebrated Latin proverb historia magistra vitae \"history is life's teacher\" which conveys the idea that the study of the past serves as a lesson for the future. As the exemplary mode is a format for displaying ideal activities, the episodes and incidents narrated in this particular mode can be seen as parables, and functionally served as examples to be followed by the reader in conduct of his own life. Bhutanese narrative literature is replete with such allusive discourses. Often, the narrative mode simply aims at teaching a lesson from history,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"4 Play of the Ominiscient by providing the reader with a good example to follow and a bad one to be avoided. In essence, the narrative mode is for the most part didactic and allegorical. The last major mode - the critical, or analytic narrative form -is by nature less anonymous and more reportative. Here the author's mind and personality often come to the fore and the story to be told is subjected to rigorous analysis. When events and incidents of the past are scrutinized, queried or challenged for validity, and arguments are tested against various interpretative patterns, or when reasoned explanations of events are offered, then the story itself transmutes into a certain kind of \"counter-story\" - an alternative reading of the events. The above modes are ubiquitously present in a plethora of biographies -whether Buddhist-clerical or secular -and in some ways these narrative discourses resemble similar forms found in other major historiographical traditions - in medieval East-Asian (Chinese), Indian and Perso-Islarnicate historiography as well as in medieval European historiography. They all seem to share a historical narrative discourse that was accentuated by the existence of an elaborate ideological mode of writing that both shaped as much as altered the way in which history was perceived. To medieval historians, the recording and writing of history was in the final analysis a selective reconstruction or subjective filtering of events of the past, with an intentional, often ideologically tainted approach. Seldom discussed, but immensely significant in this respect is an inquiry into the motive, the bare intention governing or impelling the writing of authored historical narratives (leaving aside anonymous writings, which could, however, be subjected to a similar inquiry) - that is, the author's reason for writing the work, the open or hidden agenda. Under these circumstances and constrained by the narrative\" discourse and modes described above, the following book sets out to nan\"ate the eventful life and fortunes ofjamgon Ngawang Gyaltshen, an important"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction 5 Drukpa master of Bhutan, who lived through the first unruly and unstable century of Bhutanese national independence. A man of noble birth, fine stature and dignified standing, he was a dynamic, able and, it appears, multi-talented scholar and ascetic, respected throughout Bhutan as well as further afield. Jamgon lived his life through the era that marked Bhutan's faltering and not unrisky steps towards statehood, a turbulent period, the chronicle and nan-ative of which is vividly brought to life in Jamgon's biography, an elegantly written nan-ative by the accomplished biographer, Sakya Rinchen. Jamgon's own personal saga, encompassing changes of circumstance, adventures, and changes of fortune, can be read also as the saga of Bhutan. Jamgon's legacy has proved enduring in numerous fields, such as religious arts and crafts, the art of chanting, religious dance, ritualism and religious practice, and also institutionally through his family-based incarnation line and his monastery, the ChOkhor Dorjeden (Seula) in Punakha district. His reputation and enduring legacy were to go beyond the borders of Bhutan to the wider northern Buddhist cultural area. He visited Ladakh in the early years of the 18th century during the reign of King Nyima Namgyal, and this visit helped reinforce and deepen existing ties between the two realms. On a personal scale, albeit himself untainted and unsc3lTed by the lingering conflicts, nonetheless he paid a dear price as his father was assassinated and his mother and siblings banished under han-owing circumstances. The lifelong trials of his close relatives and the suffering endured by family members who had been marginalized and alienated from society were the cause of great agony in his life. Politically not cut out for the intrigues and plottings of worldly affairs, he basically remained powerless in the face of his family's tragic fortunes at the hands of reckless foes."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"6 Play of the Ominiscient The portrait of J amgon offered by his devout pupil Sakya Rinchen, despite being intimate and generally attentive to detail, does n9t reflect upon a series of issues of a political or personal nature. The depiction of Jamgon staying aloof from the political machinations of his days may have its origin in the simple circumstance that Jamgon was Sakya Rinchen's Root-Lama. Customarily, it was deemed inappropriate to provide telling details that might taint or challenge the desired saintly portrayal of the protagonist. In the face of the humiliation and seemingly unjust treatment accorded his family by its foes, it remains a matter of conjecture as to what extent the stance taken by Jamgon (which was not dissimilar to that taken by the 4th Druk Desi, Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye during the same vexing period, arguably for similar reasons) was spurred by genuine religious sentiments urging or dictating him to abstain from involving himself in political or worldly affairs. While it readily corresponds to the stance expected to be taken by a true spiritual and pious master who advocated a neutral, non-violent and non-partisan stance, it is nevertheless inconceivable that he at no time organized any notable resistance or sought allies to counter, or at least to relieve, the suffering of his kin. His striking passivity or apparent indifference may have been rooted in fear, intimidation or timidity, but we can have no way of telling what sentiments haunted him. 2. Source Materials It was customary in Tibet and Bhutan that one of the master's principal pupils would put together a written account of the life and feats of his master and teacher. Therefore it can be no surprise that Sakya Rinchen took up the noble commitment of writing a biography of Jamgon, his Root-Lama. Although Sakya Rinchen wished the task to be ~arried out, he felt that he was utterly unworthy and unprepared for it himself. He was uncertain about his ability to take up this challenging assignment, and he was wondering how to go about it."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction 7 J amgon reportedly was initially reluctant to have his life story recorded in writing. He considered his life's activities unworthy of being committed to writing in the form of a biography, a stance routinely reported in such texts, arguably to underpin the protagonist's natural humility and modesty. However, he finally yielded to the repeated requests of his brother Ngawang Pekar (also known as Chung Rinpoche) and other disciples to have a written account prepared. Sakya Rinchen knew that J amgon actually wanted his life story penned, although he did not receive from him any direct instruction to do so. After experiencing visions and dreams in which Jamgon indicated he would like his life story to be recorded, Sakya Rinchen took these to signify that he himself should undertake the mission. The visionary experiences he had undergone evidently boosted his confidence and morale, and served as the catalyst which enabled him to put pen to paper. Ngawang Pekar already had a short written account of Jamgon's life, noted down as narrated by J amgon himself during his long acquaintance with his brother. Sakya Rinchen, too, had noted down what was told to him by Jamgon while he was serving as his attendant, and also what he had heard from others about his master. Using this source material to underpin the biography, he began to write. Sakya Rinchen (1710-1767), who was later to become the 9th Je Khenpo of Bhutan, composed his biography of Seula jamgon N gawang Gyaltshen in Punakha, during the years 1733 to 1735. This major work is rightly considered as one of the most informative and rich historical reference sources concerning l?h and 18th century Bhutan, offering us rare insights into both the personal career of the protagonist and into political developments unfolding in Bhutan during an eventful period in its history.

It was Jamgon's nephew, chaje Ngawang Thinley (1712-70), head of Seula Monastery, who was the driving force behind its publication, and no doubt he also underwrote the cost of production. We know that manuscript wliting was completed at Punakha Dzong, on the Twentieth Day of the Third Month, but the year is not mentioned.

Setting the Scene After the revival and nascent growth of religious schools in Tibet in the 1ph and 12th centuries Bhutan, then known as Lhomon (the pre-Bhutan designation of the region prior to its mid-17th century formation as a state), gradually became a suitable locale for the religious activities of various sages and ascetics. From the end of the 12th century to the beginning of the 17th century, continuous visits were made by these Tibetan itinerants, predominantly to the western part of the country. Through their activities on repeated visits, they brought to bear profound spiritual and cultural influence on Bhutan. Regardless of which school they belonged to, they were basically attracted' to Bhutan either by the great pilgrimage sites of Padmasambhava or by the search for local patronage and recognition, while some intruded into the sacred valleys of Bhutan to escape from the turmoil of Tibetan politics, caused by incessant rivalries between different schools. Once they arrived in Bhutan, they moved around seeking the support of affluent and generous local patrons, which enabled them to establish"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"1 2 Play of the Ominiscient hermitages as well as suitable places for founding their monastic seats. Through the centuries, a number of influential local gentry families and hereditary religious lineages (ch6je, zhengo) holding both religious and secular power became established in the region, in particular the diverse family lines that boasted descent from Phajo Drukgom Zhigpo (l184?-c.l251) -another early Drukpa pioneer -who held sway over large stretches of the remote and isolated western valleys, such as Paro, Thimphu, Punakha and Wangdti. They kept up close ecclesiastical bonds as a spiritual lifeline, but also maintained marital ties with the ruling heads of the Drukpa mother-seat of Ralung in Tibet. The pre-1600 abbatial throne succession in Ralung had followed .-as dictated by tradition -a familiar uncle-nephew arrangement, and the influence of many families at the court of the Drukpa hierarchs must have been considerable. More than one Ralung throne-holder in fact had a mother descended from those local families. The concomitant support, extensive monastic patronage and marital alliances of these families altogether proved to be far from insignificant for the enduring prosperity and coherence of the Drukpa School itself. The success of an ascetic or religious master in the mundane world largely hinged upon to what extent he was able to garner necessary support from his local patrons, as well as the degree to which he proved himself capable of any involvement in worldly activities. A dynamic man could acquire and wield not just immense religious authority, but also gain a fair amount oflocal temporal power, thereby enhancing the political importance of his particular religious school. In due course of time, some religious schools slowly gained primacy over laymen in dealing with secular matters.l Among various Buddhist emissaries, ranging from representatives of the Nyingmapa to those of the Sakyapa creed, adherents of the Drukpa School are the first documented propagators of Buddh}sm to have sought shelter in the remote and largely uncharted territories of western Pornmaret 1997: 186.

Judging from the number of followers and the importance of their activities,2 between the 12th century and the early years of the 17th century the Drukpa School gradually emerged as a powerful and influential presence, especially in the western part of Bhutan. The Drukpa School's success in establishing itself so firmly can be ascribed principally to the loyal patronage and support offered to it by the descendants of Phajo Drukgom Zhigpo. Ties between the descendants of Phajo in pre-17th ceutury Bhutan and the Drukpa mother-seat of Ralung in the eastern Tsang province of Tibet were maintained through religious and matrimonial links with the Drukpa rulers of Ralung. The traditional uncle-nephew (khu dbon) arrangement for ascent to the religious throne (as in most other schools in Tibet) thus ensured that in Ralung a number of the successive throne-holders and heirs were born of women who had been raised in the valleys of the Southern Lands (i.e. Bhutan).3 These contributory factors aided greatly in the Drukpa School's rapid rise to prominence in western Bhutan. By the end of the 16th century, at least five Drukpa lineages were securely established there: the descendants of Phajo Drukgom Zhigpo reigned in Paro, Thimphu, Punakha and Wangdu districts; the Tshamdrak chaje family in Chukha; the Obtsho in Gasa; the Zarchen in Paro; and Drukpa Kunley's lineage in Thimphu.4 The support of these family lineages had far-reaching consequences for the creation of a unified country. It was surely due to their unswerving and loyal support that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal (1594-1651), the legitimate but hapless prince-abbot of Ralung, was able to build his state after arriving in Bhutan in 1616. 2 Aris 1979: 165-81; Dargye and S0rensen 2001; Dargye 2001: 56-113. 3 During the late 15th century when the ruling principal seat of the 'Brug-pa school shifted to succession by reincarnation, the tradition of marital ties between the 'Brug-pa hierarchs in Rva-Iung and Bhutanese families especially those boasting descent from Pha-jo 'Brug-sgom zhig-po ceased. 4 LeB-II 97ff.

Their monastery was one of the oldest Drukpa foundations in Bhutan. It is duly recorded that the family had been the trusted patron of the successive prince-abbots of Ralung. One of the key figures of this period from Obtsho was Tenzin Drukgye (1591-1656),6 a contemporary of the Zhabdrung. Before the Zhabdrung's flight to Bhutan, Tenzin Drukgye served both as 'treasurer' (chagdzd, phyag mdzod) and as precentor or chanting master (umze, dbu mdzad) -responsible for civil as much as for ecclesiastical matters (an administrative model to be continued later in Bhutan) -at Ralung monastery, a proof of the great trust which the Zhabdrung had placed in him and his family. It was when in Tibet proper his relations with the Tsang Desi Phiintshog Namgyal 0597-1621) had taken a tum for the worse, following a number of set-backs in the wake of heated conflict regarding the then still unresolved dispute over reincarnation of the Drukpa founder Tsangpa Gyare, that the Zhabdrung began to think about fleeing either to Mongolia or to the Southern Land of the Four Approaches, as Bhutan was then commonly known.

Since we have enough religious estate there, please comeF . The Zhabdrung also received a letter of invitation from an Obtsho Lama requesting him to come to the South. Alhough the historical records do not identify the lama, it seems quite likely that Tenzin Drukgye was behind the bestowal of this invitation, while at the same time in Ralung he must have influenced the Zhabdrung in his decision to seek refuge in Bhutan, knowing that he would be wannly welcomed there by Tenzin Drukgye's own family members. The Zhabdrung accepted the offer and, escorted by the Obtsho lama fled towards the South [Bhutan]. On arrival, he was ceremonially welcomed by the family members of the Obtsho chOje as well as by others. 8 On a larger scale, Zhabdrung's flight to Bhutan proved to be a turning point, a landmark event and the birth-hour of the new nation-state to be known as 'Drukyul' or Bhutan. Following his gradual attempts to unify the isolated and disparate autonomous districts, Zhabdrung's efforts were strongly opposedby both external enemies and internal opposition. Externally, he was attacked by Tibetans on many occasions; internally, he was resisted by leaders of other religious schools in the area.

Setting their origin within a similar mythical narrative frame - the rGya progenitor also being caretakers of the celebrated J owo statue - the highly influential rGya lineage of Tibet is more easily traceable in the earliest period: it was an imperial-time clan which in the 9th-11th century is recorded to have held sway over large stretches of land and estates (part of a royally bestowed appanage grant (dbang ris) no doubt due to their service to the Tibetan kings in Myang-stod of the gTsang province towards lHo-mon; cf.

Without going into a lengthy discussion, another far more viable origin of the rGya (\"the clan from \"China\"), however, may indicate that it represented the imperial-time and indigenous rHya clan of ancient Tibet.

As a master calligrapher, he is believed to have mastered three hundred scripts (said to be current in Central Asia and beyond). To him is attributed the first composition of a distinctive Bhutanese cursive writing today known as mgyogs yig (Jogyig).

In Tibet, a founder's descendants and relatives regularly served as patrons and supporters, they often intermarried locally, and thus expanded the properties and territories in their possession. These descendants as hereditary family patriarchs and clans often assumed the title of chos rje or \"religious lords.\" Then, during the 15th century, the 8th incumbent Seng-ge rgyal-mtshan of 'Obs-mtsho directly took a wife in order to preserve the family line, after which the rule of celibacy on the throne temporarily ceased to function. 29 The dge bsnyen [chen po] was a generic name for several local deities in the greater Himalayan region; see e.g. Rene de Nebesky-Wojkowitz (1998: 222-23). dge bsnyen chen po Jag-pa Me-len later was the chief local prot~ctor in western Bhutan.

It was therefore in utmost secrecy that they took their son to zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal at Punakha Dzong to receive his blessings.

The campaign this time was on a larger scale than the earlier warfare which had taken place in 1644. The Tibetan and Mongol troops this time marched as far as Thimphu, Punakha [i.e. Gan area] and Paro. There, they laid siege for several months.46 In the midst of these warring skirmishes, the young family was compelled to flee their village and seek refuge in Punakha, in a small hamlet called Gongmo47 not far from Punakha Dzong.

Naturally, the biography at this stage repeatedly stresses that it was due to Jamgon's karmic predisposition that he realized that by leading a religious life he would be able to release himself from the agony and distress of worldly affairs. Another standard feature of his otherwise overly regulated childhood which displays his predestined disposition, was that it is reported that when he did play with his fellow comrades, he would behave as though he was superior to them, assuming the role of a religious teacher, sitting on an elevated seat. He also used to imitate a yogi in meditation and at times he behaved as if he were bestowing religious instruction and empowerment. This behaviour is said to have so highly impressed his playmates that they used to gather around him and treat him with great respect. He was predestined to become a great lord of Dharma. It was around that time that Jamgon expressed the desire to wear a monk's robe and to take up religious practice formally. He consequently went to his parents to request their permission for him to wear the saffron-coloured robe. His parents, however, were unwilling to give their consent.

Warring Conflict with the Tibetans and Internal Strife Around 1675, the Tibetan Government dispatched a considerable number of troops to invade Bhutan and the country once again was confronted by hostile alien intruders.s3 This incident caused great concern to Jamgon. A peace agreement between the two countries - again locked in combat - was proposed, but in vain. The invaders attacked from different routes - one contingent of troops camped and besieged \"The Cliff of the Dead Horse\" (rta shi'i brag) in eastern Bhutan, a second contingent captured Jakar Dzong in Bumthang in a surprise foray, and another large group made an incursion through Lingzhi. Confronted thus, people panicked, and many were in despair. The Government of Bhutan finally dispatched a strong force to deal with the invaders, ordering that all the local administrative seats, mountain paths and precipices, passes and valleys, as well as bridges should be protected by all available means. As Jamgon's father Ngawang Rabten was regarded as highly competent in military matters, Desi Mingyur Tenpa assigned him as military commander in the eastern districts (i.e. Bumthang region). Ngawang Rabten promptly took up this new responsibility. As commander, Ngawang Rabten led the troops to the central region, where Jakar Dzong had already been captured by the Tibetan troops.

Around the same period, the Dzongpon (district administrator) of Wangdii Phodrang, Gediin ChOphel, was dispatched to the Lingzhi region to command the Bhutanese troops there. It is reported that he was extremely disheartened when his troops proved unable to repel the foe. One day he led a battle at a site called Zangpolog. He lost the battle and many of his men were killed. He was close to being captured, but Jamgon's younger brother Ngawang Phiintshog came to his rescue, taking him into safety. The enemy seized the strategic site known as Masang Drubdey85 and set up a cairn (spir lcog) there. The enemy hailed bullets down on the Bhutanese army, forcing them all to take hasty refuge in the Dzong [i.e. perhaps Lingzhi Dzong]. As the conflict now worsened in the Lingzhi region, Ngawang Rabten was immediately summoned back from Bumthang. His superior leadership during the battle in Bumthang had earned him a great reputation. The Desi expressed his extreme appreciation and gratitude to Ngawang Rabten for bringing peace to the central region, and instructed him to now go to Lingzhi and confront the invaders there. It was hoped that he would be able to do better in the fight than the previous commander. The Desi promised to repay him later as a sign of gratitude, and we find that when Ngawang Rabten returned from Lingzhi the post of State Minister (nang blon) was bestowed upon him. Ngawang Rabten proceeded to Lingzhi to lead the remaining Bhutanese forces of the Gon area. It is recorded that he was a successful commander. Again, our sources almost routinely remind us that any progress on the Bhutanese side was due to a combination of the commander's military skill and the successful mediation and intervention of Bhutan's protective deities headed by Mahakala. It was this fortunate union that enabled the Bhutanese to expel the invaders. The sources record that 85 This site is located north of Gling-bzhi.

N gawang Rabten harvested rewards and ample recognition from the Desi for his victorious command whereas conversely the hapless Dzongpan Gedtin ChOphel was severely reprimanded for his envious behaviour and incompetence during the war. Ngawang Rabten was rewarded with the prestigious post of State Minister in recognition of his service to the govemment. The Dzongpan felt humiliated and embarrassed on account of both the reprimand and his own infamous battlefield failure: these events sowed the seeds of rivalry between Ngawang Rabten and the mediocre Dzongpan, leading to the first significant crisis for the Obtsho family. Dzongpan Gedtin ChOphel was close to capture or death during the battle at Zangpolog and it was Ngawang Rabten's son Ngawang Phtintshog who had come to his rescue. Yet instead of showing any gratitude, he harboured a deep-rooted grudge against Ngawang Phtintshog's father for this rescue which had resulted in subsequent humiliation and exposure as a failure and a broken reed. Jamgan's biography draws attention to this, commenting aptly that the Dzongpan most unfairly \"was repaying a treat of ambrosia by serving poison\" (bdud rtsi'i Zan du dug zos pa bzhin).

Frustrated with the machinations of worldly life, Jamgon decided to go into retreat at Cheri monastery that same year,88 at the place where Zhabdrung Rinpoche had been in retreat. In this connection, the biographer presents a beautiful and detailed description of the architectural lay-out and interior decoration of Cheri monastery, and of the surrounding landscape.

There can be little doubt that the diplomatic mission was initiated in order to strengthen the already close ecclesiastical bonds which prevailed between the Drukpa and the Sakyapa, whose support for the Zhabdrung was long established. In the 1680's, Derge was a semi-independent province, a \"kingdom\" in the Dokham region of eastern Tibet, ruled by a hereditary dynasty, and the present King was the powerful and pious ruler (sa skyong) Sangye Tenpa (d.l71O), III believed to be the reincarnation of the imperial era master Nanam Dorje Dtijom.ll2 The biography depicts his country 111 Sangs-rgyas bstan-pa (rg. ca. 1675-1710; ca. 1639-1710) was, like his entire family lineage, originally no more than rdzong dpon of sDe-dge district, nevertheless they were customarily addressed as \"King\" (sa skyong), actually a titulary form of address, indicating a petty ruler; he was in this respect regarded as the 10th King of Derge (his line was an offspring of the imperial-time mGar clan); for the pedigree, see DGR. Simultaneously he held the position of 4[h abbot of the 10callHun-grub-steng monastery traditionally adhering to the Sa-skya order (mKhan-po sKal-bzang tshe-ring, HGLG, passim). The establishment of the rdzong dpon position as the rulers of Derge owed much to the Sa-skya-pa and their former presence there. The fascinating and still widely untold history of the sDe-dge ruling house seems to have originated with a local branch lineage of the mGar clan. In the 13[h century -as recounted in prevailing histories like the DGR -a member of this family clan (himself regarded as the 29[h generation from the. progenitor, the famous minister mGar), namely dge slong rdo rje 'dzin pa sGom-ston bSod-nams rin-chen dpal-bzang-po, had followed in the entourage of 'Phags-pa Bla-ma (1235-1280) as a disciple, serving him as head attendant and as gsol dpon or \"chief servant\" For his loyal service, he was to become the recipient of the position as stong dpon or \"chili arch\" of mDo-smad district in Khams. He was granted the appropriate diploma ('ja' sa), seal with tiger-head button. The position was hereditary and his sons would continue as local chiliarchs.

In the presence of an emissary from Kham and senior monks, Gyalse Rinpoche told Jamgon that the King of Derge had sent several letters requesting the government to send a Drukpa lama, and that today he had been appointed as Bhutan's representative, since he was deemed the most suitable candidate taking into consideration his noble family background, his experience and his knowledge in both spiritual and secular matters. Gyalse Rinpoche expressed the hope that Jamgon would serve all the monastic centres, the monks and the patrons of Kham with dedication in order to spread the teachings of the Drukpa School there. Upon leaving, his travelling company consisted of nine attendants and eighteen horses.131 They set out from Thimphu very early in the morning -just as the roosters were beginning to crow, so the biographer confides to us - on the astrologically auspicious Twenty-Fifth Day of the Seventh Lunar Month of the Earth-Male-Dragon Year, cOlTesponding to 1688. Jamgon was then forty-two years of age. Jamgon and his entourage evidently took the route along Cherichu upstream through the Zatola pass. They had to climb up steep mountains before they reached the nomadic area of Lingzhi. Jamgon and his entourage (which included his two brothers, Ngawang Phiintshog and Ngawang Pekar, who had accompanied him thus far to see him off) were here respectfully greeted and welcomed by the local Dzongpon. 131 Upon leaving, it is recorded that bsTan-' dzin rab-rgyas officially retumed most of the land and estates (sa gzhis) formerly sequestered by the govemment.

They arrived at a village called Samthang (Sram-thang), where they secretly halted at the house of a pious householder named Gewa who was a devout follower ofthe Drukpa Order. Jamgon became seliously sick at his host's house, due to the high altitude and the change of environment. They still had a long journey to make before they would reach their destination, and J amgon was also worried that the secrecy of their mission might be compromised in the situation in which they now found themselves. During his rest at Samthang, two men - a father and son from Gonyul - arrived to collect a debt owed by the owner of the house. Jamgon immediately rushed inside on catching sight of the guests, and his host politely asked the two men not to enter as he had a seriously ill patient in his house that day. Although Jamgon gave them 10 tramkas [i.e. currency in coin] hoping to dissuade them from entering, they did not accept the money and tried to force their way inside. The host and others in the house were confused and did not know what to do. At that point, Jamgon made prayers to his protective deity. Suddenly the two debt collectors left without making a further move inside the house, saying that they might lose their things which they had hidden on the way. The biography informs us at that point that it was Jamgon's prayers to his protective deity Damchen Gomo and to the Triple Gem that put an end to the impasse. After his recovery, Jamgon and his entourage took up their journey again. With renewed vigour, they trekked across a vast plain without even the trace of vegetation. A razor-sharp frosty wind blew over the plain carrying fragments of stones and dust particles into their faces, irritating their eyes.

They spotted many attractive and magnificent temples and scattered hermitages decorated with victory banners raised aloft on the rooftops, and Jamgbn was now able to glimpse the residential seat of Pbchapa,132 but although he strongly desired to visit it in person, he dared not do so. Bypassing Ralung to keep their mission secret, they instead kept on the move, passing by the foot of huge snow-clad mountains where the sacred mountain-site ofNorjin GawaZangpo (Nor-sbyin [= gNod-sbyin] dGa' -ba bzang-po) was situated and then travelling along the shores of Yamdrok Yumtsho Lake (Ya[r]-'brog gYu-mtsho). They crossed Gampola (Kam-po-Ia), from where they could see the entire valley of Central Tibet D (dBus) spread out below them, with the Tsangpo River flowing through it from west to east. The entourage did not take the route through Lhasa, but instead passed through Chuwori (Chu-bo-ri) and travelled along the foothills past the monasteries of Sera and Drepung, proceeding towards Taktse of Kyishod (sKyid-shod sTag-rtse).133 They used a ferry to cross the Tsangpo River and arrived at a village called Yulchung (Yul-chung) where they rested for four days in a house provided by a certain householder named Zangpo. There they were put up in a new house which did not have proper roofing, and consequently at night the rain leaked through the roof, dropping onto Jamgbn's bed, which made his stay quite uncomfortable. 132 The 5th Rva-1ung throne-holder Seng-ge Rin-chen alias sPos-skya-pa (1258-1313) was the younger brother of rDo-lje gling-pa Seng-ge shes-rab (1236/38-1279/80), both sons of the 4th Rva-1ung abbot Nyi-ma seng-ge (1251-1287).

Alhough there was no proper arrangement for ,holding the ceremony, Jamgon conducted the empowerment of Hayagnva, whereupon the householder and his family members became even more devoted; they offered him a large amount of meat, butter and parched barley flour as a gesture of their reverence. The householder was a follower of the Drigung Kagyudpa, and he extolled the greatness of Drigung masters. He said that the Drigungpa masters had been receiving offerings daily of around 230 horses, and in any case no fewer than ten horses daily. The entourage continued on its way, passing below the Drigung monastic seat, yet again daring not to visit, lest members of the group might be detected and thus jeopardize the mission. Futher on, they arrived at Jang Mechung (Byang Me-chung), a nomadic area under the jurisdiction of Kham province. Proceeding further, they passed by a hermitage called Serjachung (gSer Bya-khyung), and arrived at a large monastery called Chamtsa (ICam-rtsa), which had earlier housed Bon tradition adherents but later had been transformed into a monastic institution following the Gelukpa tradition. Though the people at the monastery did not know who the new arrivals were, they provided them with good help. They encountered great hardship on their journey thereafter, as they slowly ran out of rations. Although a horse was sold to supplement their provisions, it did not fetch a good price. They now were compelled to beg alms of turnips on their way, which they had to eat with only a small amount of parched barley flour and salt. Eventually, they reached the monastic institution of Taklung (sTag-lung) in Kham Riwoche.134 They visited the various temples and shrines of the monastery where priceless sacred objects and scriptures were housed, including the images of successive reincarnations of the Taklung Triilkus.

The monks provided them with a guide book which included information concerning the seven days' journey towards their destination. 3. Reaching Derge and His Services to Religion After leaving Chamdo, Jamgon and his entourage now negotiated a pass called Takzila (sTag-gzigs-la), and from this point the lands through which they would pass were under the formal jurisdiction of Derge province. Arriving within their royal host's territory, they were warmly received with tea and chang by the attendants of the King who had been waiting there to welcome them. After two more days of travel, they arrived at Rigo (Ri-mgo), evidently a district of Derge Province, where they were warmly received by Dzongpon Dondrub Phel. They rested there for half a month enjoying his warm hospitality. Jamgon bestowed upon him the empowerment of Guru in its Wrathful Aspect. Setting out again, they travelled to Yen Dzong (Ye-na, or Yen rDzong) 136 where they were warmly welcomed by Dzongpon Tshering Wangchuk and stayed there for ten days, being recipients of his boundless hospitality. The next station on their route was Rabten Gonpa.137 On the request of patrons and followers at the Gonpa, Jamgon bestowed upon them long-life empowerment.

Jamgon was requested to sit on a triple-tiered seat with a table in front of it while the king himself took a seat on a thin and lower seat and offered him and his retinue sumptuous tea and other items amidst a grand zhugdrel (formal welcoming) ceremony. The King first inquired about J amgon' s health and about his journey, and then introduced himself to Jamgon by speaking about his clan origin and successive descendants who had ruled the kingdom of Derge. The King confided: Although in Tibet there are many Lamas of different sects - Sakyapa, Ngorpa, Kargyud and the Northern Drukpa, we have come to know that Ngawang Namgyal of the Southern Drukpa is a unique holy person benefiting whoever encounters him; he cannot be compared with any other Lamas, and therefore, you [JamgonJ have been invited here. Now, may I request you to stay here as long as I remain alive!139 At their very first meeting, the King gained unshakable faith in J amgon, and undertook to serve him and fulfil his every request. J amgon later related that the King was a prudent, devout and noble man, who never transgressed the confines of his noble demeanour. 138 The king usually resided in his palace or residence of ICags-ra (\"Iron-walled Enclosure\") which commonly is listed concomitant with its attached or adjacent monastery (Pho brang khag dang dgon po 'dabs 'brei), as custom dictated the structures in mDo-khams.

He too inquired about Jamgon's health and his strenuous journey, Zhabdrung Rinpoche's 140 More probably must be altered to dNgul-mda' or \"Silver Valley\" or even sNyan-mda'; DGR 15. It appears that it is the very name of the valley where Derge town presently is situated. 141 The nephew, later succeeding Sangs-rgyas bstan-pa as the 11th King of sDe-dge and as the 5th tlu'one-holder of lHun-grub-steng monastery, was like his predecessors jointly religious abbot-lord and secular ruler (bla dpon), following the traditional convention prevalent in Tibet of having a theocratic head of the dual system of secular and ecclesiastic rule. He was son of Sangs-rgyas bstan-pa's older brother, U-rgyan bkra-shis. His principal teachers are listed as mKhan-chen Sangs-rgyas pbun-tshogs and bZang-po rgyal-mtshan. Most famously, perhaps, is the record that in the wake of the assassination of the 6th Dalai Lama Tshangs-dbyangs rgya-mtsho in 1706 (he was poisoned on way to the Qing court and buried in Dolon Nor), lHa-bzang Qan attempted to install his own son, Ngag-dbang Ye-shes rgya-mtsho as the successor to the deceased 6th Dalai Lama. When lHa-bzang Qan got wind of the birth of another candidate, born in Li-thang, he dispatched one of his generals, Er-khe-ju to assassinate the candidate, and when the Derge ruler bSod-nams phun-tshogs was informed about this, he too dispatched a contingent of troops from Derge to assist and protect the favourite candidate, the rightful 7th Dalai Lama bsKal-bzang rgya-mtsho (1708-1757) inviting him and his retinue to lHun-grub-steng in around 1714. For this rescue service, bSod-nams phun-tshogs afterwards received from the later 7th Dalai Lama an edict addressed to the people of Derge in general, proclaiming the Hierarch's gratitude to the Derge bla dpon; it also granted exemption from taxes. Another verison of this tale recounts that it was lHa-bzang Qan's emissary, mda' dpon Nor-bu dngos-gnib who in Li-thang traced the birth-house of the rightful candidate and questioned the parents to establish whether the rumour that the new-born son of the house was the rebirth of the deceased 6th Dalai Lama or not; when the parents candidly confirmed that this was indeed the case, the mda' dpon told them bluntly that they could say whatever they wanted, but the decision that their son was not the appropriate candidate had already been taken. Fearing now for the life of their son, they secretly fled to Derge district, where the Derge rdzong dpon, i.e. the 12th King (and simultaneously the 6th Abbot of lHun-grub-stengs monastery) bsTan-pa tshe-ring (nephew of King Sangs-rgyas bstan-pa, incidentally) received them with the greatest hospitality.

Sonam Phtintshog counselled J amgon and supplied him with some useful advice on how to deal with the local people, and recommended him to communicate directly with the people, in an open and patient manner. He finally offered Jamgon horses, tea and other daily necessities. Jamgon returned to Changra Palace.

In Kham area, many living Buddhist traditions such as Sakyapa, Ngorpa, Kathokpa, Dechen ChOkhorpa, Karmapa and Bonpo co-existed, and usually no individual patron would discriminate or differentiate between the different traditions and denominations: for the patrons, all traditions or sects mostly carried equal weight. When people of noble descent died, the relatives would usually invite lamas and monks of different traditions to perform funeral rites together, in accordance with their individual traditions. The high ranking lamas would each receive two riding horses, while the lower ranking lamas would receive one horse each. The monastic community in general would receive female and male yaks; and those lamas who carried out the rites for the deceased persons by burning the name inscription would each receive a horse in addition to other things.

Jamgon accordingly explained to him in detail the meaning and significance of Genyen Chenpo Jagpa Melen. Following his coherent explanation, the Kings' faith in the deity now strengthened even further, and the King built a temple at the Palace of Changra, in which Jamgon installed a man-sized image of Jagpa Melen, dressed in a coat of mail bedecked with criss-crossed ribbons, and wearing intricately worked precious metal adornments, seated on his horse and sun-ounded by his retinue.147 A 146 rMe-shod formerly was a district under a gling dpon or disttict chief called Du-se.

It was said that when all the monks had gathered, there would be over two thousand of them present. Eight hundred monks were permanently living there, far more than at anyone single monastic institution of Bhutan, as Jamgon remarked. On one occasion, the King showed Jamgon all his excellent personal relics including the kapiila (skull-cup) of Kadampa Desheg Dilpa;148 a crystal chorten relic measuring the length of a hand wherein was enshrined a nail-sized bone-relic of Jowo Atisa, modelled on a Drepung Chorten; also a club once belonging to Vairocana, measuring more than an arm-length; a lado (bla rdo) or \"soul stone\" of his thukdam protector deity once belonging to Chogyal Phagpa (1235-1280) measuring two palm-lengths and made of a tliangular black stone; and a three-sided ritual dagger (phurpa) blessed by lopon Hmpkara made from acacia wood (seng ldeng, acacia catechu), and also other items.

He also advised the nomads on how to avoid natural calamities in the future by propitiating the local naga-spirits. On one occasion, a monk fled after having stolen some objects from the palace of the King at Changra. The King issued the following command to Jamgon's two Bhutanese attendants, Gomchen Sherab Dargye and Drungtsho Bothrug: \"You followers of the Drukpa! I heard that you have a great reputation for magic and power. You must arrest the monk immediately.\" The two disciples submitted humbly: \"If we succeed in arresting the thief, may we pray that Your Majesty set him free without being punished!\" They thought as to what they could do to fulfil the King's command since J amgon was not present to advise them. And so they prayed to their Lama and to the protective deities Damchen Garno and Jagpa Melen, entreating them to help them arrest the monk. Through the power of the deities as well as through the blessing of their Lama, within an instant the monk-thief suddenly returned to the Palace, speedily chased by two ravens. When the King's attendants were about to punish the man, a woman told them that J amgon' s two disciples had earlier appealed to the King to set him free without punishment.

At that time, everyone remarked: \"If even his disciples possess such miraculous power, what can be said of the power of their Lama [i.e. Jamgon]!\" This incident was reported to Jamgon upon his return, and he remarked that this incident was like a saying: \"If one is able to pray to the Lord, that will do even if one is unable to practise Dharma and practise meditation.\"154 On another occasion, J amgon was invited by Dzongpon Khamukpa (Kha-mug-pa) to visit the Palace of NeushO (sNe'u-shod) to insert zung 154 JGNT-JI93b5: rje la gsol ba btab nus nal chos ma nus kyang de kas chog I sgom ma nus kyang de kas chog."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Foray into Unknown Territory 107 scrolls in a gilded copper chOrten and then to consecrate it.

After Jamgon's return from this pilgrimage, a lama from Rodam Gonpa (Ro-sdam or Ru-dam dgon-pa)156 passed away. Before his passing away, the lama had made a will that Jamgon should be invited to preside over his funeral service. Upon receiving the invitation, Jamgon duly went to Rodam Gonpa and performed the funeral rites, and the followers of the lama in return offered him a considerable number of gifts.

At the hill called Yagze (gYag-ze), two streams were flowing, one bigger and the other smaller, between which there was a pleasant meadow said to be the tent of Shechang Drogmo (Shes-spyang 'brog-mo). Over the smaller stream, there was a bridge said to have been built by Akhu Throtum (A-khu Khro-gtum) which was called Throtum Zampa after its builder, and the valley or province was called Throtum Lungpa (Khro-gtum lung-pa). In the upper part of the valley, there was a tsan-spirit called Pholha Gandzod Nyingpo (Pho-lha Gan-mdzod snying-po) said to be the father of King Gesar, which had to be propitiated through the performance of yearly ritual offerings and the hoisting of flags dedicated to it. At one point, Jamgon had to settle a matter of some controversy. Two seemingly eligible candidates had been found for recognition as the reincarnation of a Karma Kagyud lineage of Chobdrak monastery (lCob-brag), a reincarnation lineage known as Chobdrak TrtiIku, and the followers of this lineage now requested Jamgon to explain the reasons for this. J amgon offered them valuable advice and detailed instruction on how to proceed with the selection process. The real incarnation proved to have more faith in J amgon, and displayed more respect and requested for teachings; Jamgon bestowed upon him long-life empowerment. This incarnation was under the control and protection of Mongolia (sog po), so the young rebirth was enrolled into the monk body of a Gelukpa monastic institution at an early age. Though outwardly a Gelukpa, he remained a Kagyudpa adherent in practice, and in particular followed the teachings of the Drukpa tradition.

Jamgon reported to the King that he had received a letter from the ruler in Bhutan, instructing him to return home. Unhappy and dejected on hearing this news, the King responded: We cannot find a Lama like you even by searching with a torch lit during daytime; now that we have finally found you, how can we possibly let you leave? [We cannot!] You must stay here until I die.158 The King argued that he could not countenance being separated from J amgon and that therefore J amgon must remain in Derge until the King himself had passed away. Jamgon spoke again with the King, saying that to prolong his stay would go against the command of his country's ruler, and that it would be improper for him to disobey the command. He further argued that his old mother would not live for much longer and that the state of her health worried him a lot. He therefore pleaded most emphatically with the King to be permitted to take leave. The King attempted to remain adamant, but seeing the strength of Jamgon's determination, he then replied: Had you been some other Lama, I would have the right to stop you from leaving, but since you and I are bound by sacred commitments, I cannot bear going against your request.159 The King finally gave his consent.

This time, upon a renewed request, he agreed to bestow the empowerment, and conferred upon the King the four complete empowerments of Mahakala as well as detailed explanations of tantric commitments (vajrasal11aya), including the common and specific commitments. Jamgon then went to Nyobrang Gonpa where he donated rich presents to the seat and gave religious counsel to his followers and patrons alike. He remained there for some time and since he apparently had been serving as a sort of lama of the temple, he finally handed over the charge of the temple properties to his successor. The King also came to the temple to make offerings, and afterwards visited J amgon there. After returning to Changra Palace, the King invited Jamgon, who was still at Nyobrang Gonpa, to join him there. At a farewell ceremony, the King formally presented Jamgon with many valuable gifts including riding horses and pack mules, tea, high-quality woollen cloth, gold, silver, and rolls of silk brocade, as well as Chinese pots and so forth.

As Bhutan and Tibet, even at that time, entertained no proper diplomatic relationship (gtan 'ching,s mecl), the journey back to Bhutan would be by no means easy; fearing that the Tibetans might come to know of his presence, he dressed himself as an ordinary Tibetan, and then decided to make the return journey following the routes that passed through Rongpo and Dam which he had used when travelling up from Bhutan. Custom taxes were usually required to be paid at Nagchula, the pass which crossed through the N agchu nomadic area, and this was where tea taxes also were usually collected. Intending to visit Jowo Slikyamuni, Jamgon seized the opportunity to join some Ngorpa monks of Sakya to pay tea tax there. When the first view of Lhaden Tsuglagkhang (i.e. the Jokhang in Lhasa) came within his sight on the journey, instantly stirred by faith, he made prostrations towards it. Arriving finally at Lhaden Tsuglagkhang, he halted for four nights at the house of one caretaker of wood (shing gnyer), and then for one night at a small hamlet, and during this time he paid a visit to each and every shrine of Lhaden Tsuglagkhang, including the sacred shrine-room of Jowo Rinpoche. Jamgon then continued on his journey until he reached Tshurphu of TOlung (sTod-lung) where resided the 11th Zhanag Karmapa Yeshe Dorje (Ye-shes rdo-rje; 1675-1702), who was renowned in the three realms.

Jamgon requested Karmapa for a spiritual connection (chos 'brei) and the Karmapa bestowed upon him the meditation manual of A valokitesvara. Karmapa inquired whether Jamgon was a diligent Dharma practitioner, and asked where he came from.

Although Jamgon was asked to stay on for a few days, he was able to remain one night only as he was worried about his long journey back to Bhutan. He received sacred pills called Karma Rilnag Thum (karma ril nag thum), protecting-threads, and a fragment of cloth from the garment of the Karmapa. The biographer avers that he himself had later seen how Jamgon constantly wore the blessing pills around his neck, and kept the thread and the piece of cloth rolled up in a small pouch, and that he would often make profuse praise to the Karmapa, with hands folded. Jamgon now continued his journey via Yangpachen (Yangs-pa-can), over the Nyenchen ThangTha (gNyan-chen thang-la) mountain chain and on reaching Zhikatse (gZhis-klia-rtse) he again paid tea tax.

For this reason, Jamgon spent the winters down at Chunglung (Khyung-lung),168 where he used Chunglung Gonpa as his winter residence. At each of these Gonpas -Dolung and Chunglung -he pursued meditation.

Thinking that the custom would discourage those who had a serious interest in going into retreat, Jamgon banned this costly system of making offerings. As a result, the number of people genuinely wanting to pursue meditation increased dramatically. He similarly ruled that patrons of the Gonpas should not make large and ostentatious food offerings as this brewed competitiveness amongst patrons vying for prestige and fame. He permitted only the supply of a meagre amount of food provisions just enough to sustain the livelihood of those residing at the Gonpas. Upon the request of the patrons and other devout followers, Jamgon introduced annual MaJ.li Drubchen (Ma l}i sgrub chen) sessions at Chunglung Gonpa. As a gesture of respect for him, the devout patrons offered him some lands. He in turn donated these lands to the Gonpa as religious estates (mchod / chos gzhis), the cultivation of which would provide revenue and endowment for sponsoring the annual MaJ.li Drubchen rites. A hermit named Marzhongpa (Mar-gzhong-pa) who had over many years remained in mountain retreat and who had gained sufficient meditative practice once came to see Jamgon. With skilful questioning, Jamgon tested the hermit's knowledge. The hermit proved to have gained good experience in samatha (breathing meditation) practice, but still had not comprehended the nature of mind and therefore had not realized the true nature of mind itself. On the contrary, the hermit was overconfident, thinking that his mind already rested in the sphere of the 'Great One-tastedness' of mind (gnas cha la ro gcig chen po yin). Jamgon, however, corrected his errors by imparting to him dharma talk, and introduced him to the unconstructed natural state of mind, by differentiating expelience and realization.

During that period, while he was bestowing the empowerment of Samvara, a vajra fell from his hand onto the floor; it was said that a clear imprint of the vajra was left on the floor. On one occasion, while Jamgon was giving the Hayagnva Longevity empowerment blessing, King Nyima Namgyal and his ministers arrived to attend the ceremony. Among the King's attendants was a yogi who tried to challenge Jamgon by way offalse argument in debate. Jamgon without any sense of arrogance defeated him with soft words in accordance with the Dharma. The yogi now with great devotion and respect threw himself at Jamgon's feet. At one time, Jamgon, accompanied by Dung Rinpoche, set off for Rebag (Re-bag) towards Garzha (Gar-zha) having heard that there was a self-created blessings-bestowing Arya statue [i.e. Arya A valokitesvara] in the temple there. On reaching a pass, they were received by Dung Rinpoche's uncle Nono Chung (No-no gcung) who invited them to his residence. They finally arrived at Rebag, where the self-created Arya was located. The temple which housed the statue was made of stone with a measure of one fathom in length and it had a stone pillar inside and the entire layout was beautiful. When the entrance door was opened, one could see the white marble statue which had one head and six arms. On the hair-knot was an almond-eyed image of Amitabha, emitting rays of light. Jamgon made prostrations several times in front of the sacred image. Concerning the origin of this particular self-created A valokitesvara -according to the legend - it was said that in the upper part of that region, there were one hundred and eight streams flowing white lik~ milk from which seven brothers (sku mched bdun) were born.

That head is said to be the one now in the Temple of Gandhola. At the one end of the valley, there was another temple called Makhu (Ma-khu = Mar-khu; the \"Oil Temple\"), where Jamgon saw a statue of a blessings-bestowing VajrayoginI made of cast metal (li sku). There was an oily black square-shaped stone (also called makhu) said to be the thumb of VajravarahI, which even the strongest man with all his might would not be able to lift and carry around the smaller temple more than two or three times; but Jamgon himself took it on his head and circumbulated [the entire temple complex] once while making extensive prayers. Thereafter, he visited the temple called Ghandhola where he saw the head of the last brother. Taking it in his hands, he made prayers, whereupon shimmering drops of nectar dripped from its neck. While on their pilgrimage throughout the Garzha area, they arrived at a village called Kardang (dKar-dvangs),195 where Jamgon saw the foot-print of Gotshangpa Gonpo Dorje (1189-1258).196 There had been no rain in that area for three years, the fields lay parched, no crops Were ready for harvest, and as a result the people had been suffering from hunger.

The King, as always, was very impressed and pleased with his court chaplain. Although the King personally wanted to receive further empowerments and dharma instruction directly from Jamgon, it seemed that this was somehow prevented by the ministers. In a conversation between the King and his ministers, the view was expressed that to be a court priest, it was not enough to be a virtuous monk and come from a noble family: one should also be able to display miraculous powers. This conversation was overheard by one of Jamgon's attendants, who reported it to him. To this implied criticism, Jamgon merely responded: Signs of spiritual accomplishments [or miracles} depend upon the size of merit that one's disciples have accumulated. If the disciples have no pure vision and faith, it would not have any benefit even when they meet Buddha in reality. So, to be able to receive blessings, it is extremely important that one should have devotion and faith with pure vision. In reality, lamas of today and spiritual friends (dge ba'i bshes gnyen) are all MaJ)ifested Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and although they produce an incessant flow of signs of accomplishment, the reason why one does not see them is that the vision of ordinary people is usually obscured by wrong views.197 The attendant was amazed at his master's reply, and merely stood reflecting upon his master's unfathomable mind.

Snow fell incessantly, the palm-sized snow flakes coming from all directions, and people and horses almost sank into the snow. This is precisely what happened as the team struggled along now. All the attendants became agitated and extremely frightened, and they cried out in their terror.

In the middle of the hall there was a square stone floor, in the centre of which was a small pond from which water spouted upwards. The hall had four annexes opening off it. Entrance to each annex was via a brick-lined doorway which led into a pillarless circular vestibule, shaped like a lotus flower. Each annexe was topped with a golden pinnacle. Although formerly a thriving monastery, the complex now had been taken over by heretics and had become a place for their worship.

Subsequently, that man became a very famous yogi and later on even came to Ladakh to see Jamgon. They arrived at Achig ChOkhor (i.e. Alchi)203 which had been founded by lotsawa Rinchen Zangpo (lo-tsa-ba Rin-chen bzang-po; 958-1051)204 and which had one storey high images of each of the Buddhas of the Three Times. The wall pqintings depicted one thousand Buddhas, and printed on the robe of each Buddha were one thousand Buddhas, and on the walls of the corridors, there were also one thousand Buddhas. Then they came to Babgoikha (Babs-sgo'i mkhar),205 where they saw a temple which contained the Seven Buddhas (Sangs-rgyas Rab-bdun)206 installed upon one single seat with the main statue being a two storey high Buddha Maitreya. They finally arrived back at Takna Gonpa where J amgon stayed for some days and then went to the palace of Leh, where he was again received with great honour by the King. As per the King's command, Jamgon thereafter went to Shelkar Palace and practised longevity sadhana for the King and the Royal Family, and Mru;rifested great powers, so that the holy water vase overflowed of its own accord. The King was fully confirmed in his faith together with his ministers. 203 A-cig chos-'khor is today commonly known as Alchi. It is located west of Leh. This temple is one of the largest and most famous temples built by Lo-tsa-va Rin-chen bzang-po. 204 He was a great translator, writer and builder of temples and was universally acknowledged as the founder of the New Tantras (i.e. the Later Spread of the Doctrine or bsTan pa phyi dar), and brought a period of great reformation and renaissance to Buddhism in Tibet in the 10th and ll'hcentury. 205 Babs-'go'i mkhar, today commonly known by Ba-sgo, is located 42 kms west of Leh. The castle is known as Ba-sgo Rab-brtan lHa-rtse-mkhar. It was built by La-dvags king 'Jam-dbyangs rnam-rgyal and his son Seng-ge rnam-rgyal.

Religious Rituals and Pilgrimage Gradually, Jamgon became renowned, and gave Drukpa Kagyud teachings to many of the population including the King and his ministers. On the request of the King and his ministers, Jamgon conducted an initiation ceremony which consisted in bestowing empowerments and delivering different religious instructions. During the construction of a house for Kalon Sonam Lhtindrub, a scarcity of rain prevailed, and it was impossible to dig into the earth. They needed rain to soften it, so his wife Numo Trashima (Nu-mo bKra-shis-ma) came into the presence of Jamgon with tea and requested: \"0 Lama, although we are trying to build a house, since the sky is cloudless, the earth is very hard to dig, please assist us to produce rain.\" Without replying, he performed the ritual and immediately a huge shower of rain fell. On another occasion, she again came into his presence, serving him tea and entreated: \"The bricks will become loose, therefore, please again help us and this time stop the rain.\" Immediately, Jamgon stopped the pouring rain. He produced and stopped rain on request on many occasions, and his mastery in controlling the flow of rain was such that it was as if the rain was curled around his fingertips (phyag mdzub la dkres pa ltar). Once, a sister of Kalon was possessed by a spirit. Drigungpa and Sakyapa lamas, lamas of Hemis Dung, and Gelukpa lamas were all invited and performed various rituals, only to be unable to control the spirit. Jamgon was now invited and he uttered mantric spells (ljags sngags) followed by a ransom ritual that relieved her from the spirit. Likewise, those people who still had not recovered from illness now asked for Jamgon's blessing, and they too were relieved. By then, J amgon had received a reply from Druk Rabgye, the 8th Desi of Bhutan to a letter he had written earlier, requesting permission to return to Bhutan. Reading it, he found that he was allowed to return if he had successfully completed his mission in Ladakh as stipulated in the letter: \"You may come back if it is in accordance with the wishes of the King and ministers and if your obligations are fulfilled.\""},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"1 66 Play of the Ominiscient He showed the letter to the King and requested that he be allowed to return to Bhutan. The King with many words of respec~ however requested: \"0 Lama Rinpoche, please have mercy on us, the King, ministers and the people of Ladakh and remain here.\" The King pleaded with him strongly and J amgon, unable to reject the wish of the King, for the time being had to remain in Ladakh. Still, Jamgon repeatedly submitted requests to the King to be allowed to return to Bhutan, and in particular he stated that he had an old mother and he was anxious about her health, and he said: \"It would not be proper to disappoint my parents, who had given birth to my mind and body, this time I really must go.\" This time, the King and ministers could not refuse Jamgon's request. They reluctantly gave their consent for his return to Bhutan. However, Lonchen Kunga who possessed a good judgement proposed: If we do not fulfil the Lama's wish, our practice of the Dhanna will be meaningless. On the other hand, if we do not fulfil the wish of the King, this also would not be proper, so if you by all means want to go, I at least request you to stay this year for the benefit of King and people, then after that there is no way that we can refuse your wish. The proposal was discussed, and both the King and Jamgon accepted this condition and the latter remained in Ladakh for one more year. During the course of the year, the King learnt more about the prevailing relations that had prevailed between Bhutan and Ladakh during the time of King Senge Namgyal and zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal. Jamgon submitted a request to the King: In former times, there existed a close patron-priest relationship between Zhabdrung and your great grandfather Senge Namgyal, during which time your Uncle Gyalpo Tenzin (rGyal-po bsTan-'dzin Nor-bu) came to Bhutan and served as Dzongpon of Wangdti Phodrang. He rendered great service to the teachings of Buddhism, and I now request you, too, to send one of your brothers to B~utan. If you kindly allow this, it would be greatly beneficial to Buddhism. The King agreed, and it was decided that his younger brother Ngawang Tenzin Norbu should go to Bhutan. However, there was great anxiety"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Dutiful Mission 167 and worry among the King and the ministers that the journey to Bhutan would be risky, due to the lingering conflict between Bhutan and Tibet. The King hesitated to agree to his brother's departure, but Jamgon reassured him, 'predicting that all would go well on the journey and giving his personal guarantee. To ensure this, before Ngawang Tenzin Norbu and his entourage left, Jamgon presented the royal Ladakhi prince with a protective amulet, with sacramental substances, presents that would ensure their safe journey. He also issued a command to the protective deity, entreating them to help making the journey.safe. The Royal party then set off and subsequently reached Bhutan without having encountered any obstacles whatsoever on the way, Ngawang Tenzin N orbu served as a Lopon in the Central Monastic Body. He later became the 6th Chila of Rinpung Dzong in Paro and eventually rose to become the 8th Je Khenpo of Bhutan (rg.l738-44).207 Jamgon decided again to undertake a pilgrimage trip, this time to Zangskar (Zangs-dkar), where Nampa formerly had accomplished the recitation of the seven-syllable mantra of Sarp.vara 100,000 times. Once when they had lost their track, two pigeons surprisingly appeared and guided them for the length of a day's journey. Finally, they arrived at Patumkhar (dPa' -gtum-mkhar), the palace of the King of Zangskar, where they were given a very warm welcome by the Queen and Princes, who served them with high veneration. As requested by the royal family members, Jamgon conducted rituals meant to dispel obstructing spirits and bestowed longevity empowerment upon the King, royal family members and ministers.

The chOrten was made purely of precious cast metal called dzikshim211 with a measure of four elbows in height. The ground in front of the chOrten was paved with white stone, and the local people called this area the \"Fire of the Cemetery\" or Durme, and it was said that one could see burning flames coming up through the paving stones. They spent that night there and the next day while proceeding along the mountainside they came to a deep cave, inside which it was said there was a \"soul stone\" of the Twelve Female Protectors212 having the shape of a protruding breast. Thereafter, they arrived at the meditation cave of Naropa. Inside they found a Drukpa 208 It is a 'Brug-pa bka' -brgyud monastery in Zangs-dkar and served as a branch monastery of sTag-na Monastery in La-dvags. 209 It is believed that Naropa's mortal remains were preserved in this stupa.

Accordingly, J amgon and his entourage set off accompanied by a host of attendants including the King, ministers and Dung Rinpoche. After travelling for five days from Ladakh, they arrived at a sacred site where a self-created A valokitesvara image was found. Here J amgon told the King and ministers to take leave, and with great sadness bade them farewell: they entreated Jamgon to continue to look upon them compassionately in all their successive life-times. Jamgon recited prayers for them and then blessed each of them by placing his hand on their heads.

They rested there for seven days and during their stay they visited sacred mountain sites in the vicinity. They spent a night at Zuthrulphug (rDzu-'phrul-phug). Recollecting the inconceivable devotion and faith he harboured for jetsiin Milarepa, Jamgon here made many prayers. He paid a visit to the mountain site, particularly to see the footprints of Sugata which were visible on a rock known as \"Immutable Nail\" (mi 'gyur ba'i gzer) located in the four directions of Kailash. He made a copy of one footprint on a piece of cloth, making the imprint with the help of saffron water. The biographer claims that he had himself seen this later. Then they returned to the seat of Dorzin where they were served with great respect. Jamgon and his party continued their journey.

When they halted overnight at the upper part of Samthang (Sram-thang), two good horses were taken away by robbers in the night. Having noticed their disappearance, the attendants tried to look for them by following their hoof-plints, but in vain. Jamgon, on learning about this, kept quiet for sometime in contemplation; afterwards a clear neighing sound was heard from a distant pass. Hearing it, the attendants became very happy, and the horses suddenly appeared galloping, completely exhausted and panting heavily, and everyone was taken by surprise.

Jamgon was not permitted to move further on from there and was put under strict detention in one of the Dzongs. Due to the contaminated water at this place, he became severely ill, his entire body was swollen, and he was unable to take his meals. However, he never stopped his devotions, and the local people were fascinated by him.

In the Tibetan Government, there was a far-sighted dapon (mda' dpon, bligadier) named Sarnlingpa (bSam-gling -pa). Hearing of J amgon' s repute, out of devotion and deeming that the well-being ofthe Buddhist teaching and living beings of Bhutan and Tibet might be adversely affected if Jamgon was in danger of losing his life, the Dapon immediately appointed a physician to treat Jamgon's illness.

Though Jamgon desired to resign from secular responsibilities, the government did not allow him to do so. During his long absence, not only had his own mother passed away without their reunion, but also many of his friends with whom he had spiritual connections had also died while others of them had gone for retreat. Now, he only had one thing in his mind, and that was to lead a secluded life devoted to meditation. He went to a place called Bardzong (Bar-rdzong) where he remained in strict meditation. After the completion of his retreat, he went to Punakha. Even there, he continued his meditative practice. At that time, there was a widespread occurrence of disease in the area and even the monks including Zopa Thinley (bZod-pa 'phrin-Ias), the 5th Je Khenpo (1707-24)221 had to seek a secluded place to avoid being affected.

The Punakha Dzong also swayed back and forth and seemed in imminent danger of collapse, prompting the monk community including the Je Khenpo to move out of the Dzong and to seek shelter on the ground outside. All the people panicked and did not know what to do. Wondering what would be the best means to repel the bad omens that had translated into earthquakes, Desi Druk Rabgye sought a timely solution by way of divination and received the following advice: A void the ten non-virtuous deeds and make the law of the land strict; religious practitioners must vigorously practice meditative approach and accomplishment (sevasadhana; bsnyen sgrub).

Still the Desi did not relieve him, and so he was compelled to take the responsibility upon himself and thus proceeded to Paro. As Jamgon's appointment coincided with the warring skirmishes between Bhutan and Tibet, most of the food provisions held in the treasuries of Paro Dzong had been exhausted. During the conflict, J amgon had to replenish the treasuries and oversee the entire administrative process, delegating the various responsibilities to different trusted men. As Chila, he proved so dedicated to his work that he would not allow misuse or embezzlement of any kind; placing, as the biographer writes, the interest of others above his own, he would collect provisions for the storehouse and, even though he was entitled to receive a traditional share of provisions as personal recognition or award (bdag rkyen, adhipatipratyaya) to be used for his private purposes, a share equalling that of Zhabdrung Rinpoche and his son, he would not keep anything for himself, but would deposit his share in the government treasury. He strictly controlled the taking of evening meals by monks who had taken full monastic vows, and any breach of discipline he considered theft against the government. As a matter of fact, he found the creeping degeneration of monastic discipline most distressing. He attempted to give counsel on these issues, entreating each and every monk to strictly adhere to pure monastic conduct. Accompanied by the chiefs of the different regions under Paro [district], J amgon visited Punakha to attend the Dromcho ceremony.

Performing Miracles and Delivering Teachings At one time, a village headman from a certain village called Drangchu (sBrang-chu) came to meet Jamgon saying: \"0 Lama Rinpoche, since there has been no rain in the entire Thed region in general and in my village in particular, we are not able to carry out fanning, therefore may 1 request you to make rain fall.\" Jamgon replied: \"1 am not the one who gained control over the elements; I do not even possess magical power, so how can 1 be able to produce rain? Hence, it is better you request other masters.\" Since the man repeatedly pleaded, \"It cannot be misleading if we pray to the Triple Gem,\" saying thus, Jamgon started making a propitiation ritual to the protective deity Pelden Lhamo, and instantly the sky became overcast, and as soon as torma were thrown into the fire, rain began 240 A stiipa in the shape of khang gzugs mchod rten stands in front of the entrance to the main Chos-'khor rdo-lje gdan monastery, enslnining the sku gdung m\"chod rten said to be that of bSod-nams 'od-zer.

The whole landscape which had earlier been grey and dry now tum~d lush and green and the people were very happy, saying 'what a heavy downpour this year!' Jamgon was once invited to consecrate a temple of Nyizer Lhakhang (Nyi-zer Iha-khang),242 near Wangdti Phodrang after its renovation had been completed. He consecrated the temple with a ritual ceremony dedicated to Vajradhara and gave the empowerment of longevity to all the people gathered there. He then went to Wangdti Phodrang where he was most respectfully received by the Dzongpon. He gave empowerment of Aksobhya to those residing in the Dzong. He visited all the sacred objects inside the central tower and made offerings and aspiration prayers. Invited by devotees, he thereafter went to a village which was constantly afflicted by death and curses. Transforming himself into Wrathful Guru, he performed a ritual to dispel obstructing forces through the wrathful intent of the contemplative state and then gave the empowerment of longevity, whereafter it was said that the village was not affected by misfortune anymore and it prospered. At Punakha, he met with chOje Ngawang Pekar (chos rje Ngag-dbang pad-dkar) from whom he received the vows of the Seven Branches of a Bodhisattva (byang sems kyi sdom pa yan lag bdun pa), the Three Kinds of Discipline (tshul khrims gsum), and the ritual pertaining to the Three Stages of a Practice (sbyor dngos rjes).

From that time onwards, year after year, many monks would assemble at his residence to receive teachings, and to all of these he gave teachings according to their level of understanding and devotion. He explained to his disciples the following: In general, the lineage of our precious Kargyud tradition is the quintessence of all; in particular, the main characteristic practice of the glorious Drukpa, the exclusive devotion to our Lama being our main principal approach, a great number of ascetics and saints therefore appeared [in our tradition] as numerous as stars in the sky and as dust-particles on earth; moreover, due to the certainty that it has been said [once in one source]: \"Naropa, bless the Northern Direction [i.e. Himalaya]!\" the entire Snow-capped Region [i.e. Tibet] became a proper vessel for the activities of the glorious Drukpa School.

An anecdote is recounted claiming that he gave a conch-shell (dung dkar), drum (rnga) and bell (dril bu) to his three disciples, and sent them to different places to practise meditation. One received a bell and the other two received a conchshell and a drum. The two disciples who received a conchshell and drum preserved them, and did not make use of them, thinking that those were gifts from their Guru. The one who received the bell was gTsang-pa rgya-ras. Thinking that whoever hears the sound of a bell [the Dharma sound] would be freed from the lower realms, he slung the bell on a vulture which was residing nearby his meditation cave. Frightened by the sound of the bell while taking to its wings, the vulture went on flying for eighteen days, which was seen as an auspicious portent. gTsang-pa rgya-ras accordingly would spread his teachings ['Brug-pa Teachings] to a distance covered by a vulture in about eighteen days (bya rgod po nyin lam beo brgyad tsam du khyab pa grags), whereas the other two disciples could spread as far as the sounds of a conchshell and a drum could reach.

Founding of Seula Chokhor Dotjeden: Turning the Wheel of Dharma Jamgon now gradually began to gather many disciples around him; he not only had disciples coming from the two principal monastic seats - TrashichOdzong and Punakha, but also from other parts of the country. He continued delivering numerous teachings beginning with· preliminary practice to the highest level of teachings which included pith instructions, precepts, and initiations of the Drukpa Kagyud system. After the disciples had been fully trained in the theoretical part of the teachings, Jamgon had them undergo practical training in meditation. The honing of yogic or meditational skills, he contended, was the most important part of the Buddhist practice. Since Jamgon's hermitage at Seula (Se'u-la)248 was very small, the hermitage faced a problem in accommodating disciples while providing 248 The name of Byams-mgon's main monastic seat Se'u-la - mig.

The residence-cum-monastery was now extended by his most devout disciples and loyal followers and the consecration ceremony was performed in a most consummate manner, for three full days, during which locl~en Ngawang Sonam offered long-life prayers according to thePadma Lingpa system of Invoking the Dakinls (mkha' 'gro gdan bzhugs). The place was ceremoniously named Chakhor Dorjeden, or the \"Vajra Seat for Turning the Wheel of Dharma.\"249 At Ch6khor Dorjeden, Jamgon gave four complete empowerments250 of Cakrasarp.vara to a large gathering of monks headed by Chung Rinpoche Ngawang Pekar, and to lochen Ngawang S6nam. He gave them detailed explanations about observance of the samaya-vows, saying: Nowadays, due to the general degeneration of practice, there are many who transgress the Threefold Vows, and so it is very important that you yourselves strive to acknowledge your own transgressions and rid yourselves of impUlities; even if you cannot accomplish that, you should at least recite the One Hundred-Syllable Mantra (yig brgya) dedicated to Vajrasattva no less than twenty-one times daily, in whichever way is convenient to you; in particular, make confession by reciting the Root Verses of Downfalls (rtsa ltung) regularly, at least one time a day. Not only has this Confession of Downfalls been commended by the great master Lingrepa Perna Dorje (Gling-ras-pa Padma rdo-rjeJ51 as being greatly beneficial, but is also said to be of profound help as a counter measure in purifying the root and branch samaya that are to be observed. 249 The year offoundation is stated to be 1715. 250 The four-fold empowerments are the 'vase empowerment' (bum dbang), the 'secret empowerment' (gsang dbang), the 'primordial-wisdom empow~rment' (shes rab ye shes kyi dbang), the 'word empowerment' (tshig dbang). 251 Gling-ras-pa Padma rdo-lje was a senior disciple of Phag-mo-gru-pa.

The tradition of the D.agpo Kargylid which at one time became renowned like the sun and the moon is not like a cover or husk [of com or rice], but represents the quintessence of all that is essential, and this tradition is still floUlishing without impairment. Not fearing or shying away from the hardship and taking upon yourselves all the sufferings, pursue your practice with great endeavour in order to direct your life to the sublime stage. Whenever there are challenging and terrifying experiences at night, remain steadfast, free from the extremes of hope and fear and with complete trust in your mind. Keep your mind free of false ideas.

The master Tenpa Gyaltshen (bsTan-pa rgyal-mtshan) accompanied by his attendants arrived in the presence of Jamgon. Jamgon urged the master: Compared to earlier days, the precious Teachings of Buddha now are in a state of degeneration and in particular, although kunkhyen Pemakarpo has written many important expositions on quintessential instructions, precepts, and liturgical subjects, due to the ill fortune of sentient beings, most of these writings have already been lost and now exist only in fragmentary form. Hence the tradition of the Drukpa is also on the verge of becoming merely a name. It seems that a Sakya lama who now lives in Shar Phangyul [i.e. referring to Shar Dargye Gonpa] is very learned in all fields. Even though it may be fatiguing to you, if you can receive empowerment, transmission and precepts of Hevajra including its complete texts, and also other teaching and empowerment including the Kalacakra and Guhyasamaja Tantra as it may suit you, it would be extremely beneficial for you.

At that time, Jamgon also conducted a ritual dedicated to Buddha Aksobhya, including the performance of the fire puja two thousand times, and then satisfied all the ritual performers (cho ga pa) with a large amount of gifts of both cash and in kind. At times in the midst of delivering teachings, Jamgon gave essential religious instructions. He said: Our Dagpo Kargyud Tradition is the lineage of practice and blessing, so whatever the activity of a Lama may be, do not question it and believe always that whatever the Lama does is for the sake of the disciples. It is necessary to pray to your Lama with the utmost devotion while thinking that he is the embodiment of all the Buddhas; and whatever you do, repose your complete trust and faith in the Lama while seeking refuge. Again, at another time, after having remained quiet III meditation, Jamgon said: On occasions when you are overwhelmed with uncontrolled thinking, leading to dismay, anger, imaginings and so forth. You should visualize that in your heart is a fully opened eight-petalled lotus, in the centre of which is a precious lion-throne decorated with vcuious silken cloths. On top of this is the seat of the lotus, the sun and the moon, upon which your Root -Lama rests with a smiling face, emitting rays of blessing. Pray to him with devotion from the bottom of your heart, recollect his kindness and think that the Lama and your mind cu\"e an inseparable unity. Leave your mind in equanimity! Also, he counselled his disciples on religious matters: To be able to enter into Buddhist practice, you should make a spiritual pledge and commitment; this is the tradition to train your mind towards Bodhicitta. Although it is necessary to practise pure Dharma without intermingling with worldly affairs, due to great obscuration caused by ignorance and habitual tendencies, it is hard to be mindful and conscientious. Nevertheless, it is very important that the outer discipline and behaviour should be in confonnity with the vows of Pratimok~a. As it is said, \"Just as the earth is the foundation of everything in the world, so also moral discipline is the foundation of all virtues.\" The training of moral practice is the basis of all good qualities, so nurture it with determination.

Since the difference between the greater and smaller vehicles rests with the unique Generation of the Mind [towards Enlightenment] ([byang chub] sems bskyed), it is important to persevere in the practice of the precious Bodhicitta, yet it will be of no benefit if you do not know how to practice it by way of the threefold concepts.253In this connection, Gyalwang Je Kiinga Penjor said that if one's practice is in accordance with the outer discipline (phyi 'dul ba) and inner mantra (nang gsang sngags) tradition, its essence will be naturally comprehended.

At Punakha, he requested the monk community to perform the ritual ceremony of Vajra-Aki?obhya - the Mal)c:lala for purifying the lower realms. For three days, he served the entire monk community tea and dishes in a consummate manner. At the end of the ritual ceremony, he made offelings in cash liberally. He also presented many gifts to the ruling hierarchs. To all the temples, he made abundant offerings in cash, and also presented incense and butter lamps. At that time, the people were attracted by material donations rather than Dharma. Just then, the spiritual master Tenzin Dondrub who was in the capital came to meet J amgon. Through indivisible pure vision, they expressed to each other their feelings of delight and discussed religious matters. The spiritual master was not able to speak clearly since he had a sore throat, so J amgon was not able to hear properly what he said. With great regret, Jamgon returned to his residence and shed tears.

Continuing Dharma Activities, and Illness The 9th Desi, geshe Ngawang Gyamtsh0257 issued an order for the fabrication of a huge silk brocade thongdrol (mthong grol), a wall-thangka of A valokitesvara for the Punakha Dzong. When the thongdrol had been successfully completed in the early winter, the 9th Desi sent his messenger to invite Jamgon for the consecration ceremony. Having accepted the invitation Jamgon, accompanied by Sakya Rinchen, proceeded to Punakha where he met the ruling hierarch.258 During conversation over tea, some of the monks submitted a request to J amgon: \"Lama Khenchen259 intends to invite you to his residence tomorrow.\" 256 It was in 1725-26, during the reign of the 9'\" Desi Ngag-dbang rgya-mtsho that Bhutan invaded Sikkim due to lingering border disputes (during the reign of 'Gyur-med rNam-rgyal, the 4th Chos-rgyal of Sikkim).

Subsequently, Gyalse Triilku accompanied by jetsiin Ngawang Thinley and their attendants arrived at Seula. Jamgon extended a warm welcome to them and taught the ritual intonation of the MaI).qala rituals to Gyalse Triilku andjetsiin Ngawang Thinley. Gyalse Triilku returned to Punakha. Soon afterwards, Jamgon was invited to Punakha by the government. It was at that time that Jamgon consecrated the newly built Stapa of the Type for Repairing Schisms (dbyen zlum, antaryana) which had been erected outside the Dzong. He continued to give teachings to Gyalse Triilku and others; he again became severely ill due to food poisoning, the illness exacerbated due to his advanced age. Worried about how very ill Jamgon was, Gyalse Triilku offered prayers for his long-life involving extensive material offerings. Slightly recovered, Jamgon left for his retreat residence at Seula. He performed the Vajra-Ak~obhya -MaI).qala for purifying the lower realms one thousand times, and the ritual of Guru Worship involving aspiration prayers and fire puja, after which he fully recovered and was able to return to Punakha. In the presence of sacred images in the temple at Punakha Dzong, Gyalse Triilku took the Pratimok~a and novice monk vows with J amgon acting as the preceptor in 1729.

At that point, the time again had come for the great monk community along with the Je Khenpo to move to their summer residence, TrashichOdzong in Thimphu. Although Jamgon wanted to leave for his retreat residence, on the command of Gyalse Triilku, he had to follow the monk community to Thimphu, ahead of the entourage of the hierarchs (gong sa mchod yon; [presumably the two incarnate brothers D. The hierarchs and their retinues were not able to proceed to Thimphu, turning back on receiving news of political strife in Thimphu and Paro. For the time being, the two incarnate brothers went instead to Wangdii Phodrang. Later on, when Thimphu Dromcho278 was imminent, Thritul Rinpoche Mipham Wangpo proceeded to TrashichOdzong. There he met with Jamgon, who offered to Thritrul Rinpoche in great detail the empowerment and instruction of Wrathful Kilaya envisioned by kiinkhyen Pemakarpo, the Black Hayagnva according to the system of Myangral Nyima Yozer, Vajrabhairava according to the system of Rva Lotsawa (rva lugs), and the authorization teaching of Lhamo Diisolma and so forth. Jamgon went in the company of Je Khenpo Ngawang Thinley to Rinpung Dzong in Paro for reconciliation, but they had to return abruptly to Thimphu, since the political strife had grown worse. Feeling extremely compassionate towards both the perpetrators of bad actions and those who had suffered ill treatment, Jamgon spoke of many issues related to worldly renunciation and his weariness of worldly life. At that time, the author Sakya Rinchen was also in Jamgon's presence reading the Kanjur, and Jamgon related to him the benefits of perfect reading and the defects of imperfect reading, particularly speaking of cause and effect as gleaned from the Sutra of the Confession of Kausika (Ka 'u-shi-ka 'i bshags mdo )._ 278 Drornchoe [= sgrub mchocfj at bKra-shis chos rDzong, Thim-phu, is specifically dedicated to dPal-ldan lha-rno (SrI DevI), and was first introduced by Kun-dga' rgyal-rntshan (1689-1713), the 1\" incarnation of 'J am-dpal rdo-rje (1631-1681), son of Zhabs-drung Ngag-dbang mam-rgyal."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The Final Years: Handing on the Torch 239 Once, looking at the biographical thangka of Jowo Naropa, Jamgon told S akya Rinchen with tears in his eyes: \"We must all follow the same ideal life pursued by Naropa; to allow ourselves to sink down in the muddy swamp of indolence is simply too embarrassing.\" Sakya Rinchen was regularly attending upon his Lama with ardent faith. Once he is said to have taken a cup full of water with which Jamgon had washed his face, and as a result of this all his discursive and wild thoughts were said to have instantly become calm, so that he could comprehend the ultimate nature of conceptual thought as the true nature of reality. 2. Final Activities At that point, Bhutan again was invaded by the Tibetans, and Gyalse Triilku, together with the monk community led by Je Khenpo Ngawang Thinley, left for their winter residence at Punakha, while Jamgon still remained in Thlmphu. The entire Thimphu valley is said to have been flooded with invading troops, and temples and monasteries were destroyed, and many chortens and meditation centres vandalized.

Concerned about this development, a number of Tibetan leaders proposed to Pho-lha-nas that there should be a truce.

When the hostilities subsided, he, too, went to Punakha where he was welcomed with high honour by the two incarnate brothers of Gyalse Trlilku and Thritrul Rinpoche. J amgon' s younger brother N gawang Pekar who was residing at Chokhor Dorjeden suddenly fell sick. Since his condition turned to the worse, he thought that he was about to pass away; he therefore made offerings at Namgyaltse and Ngodrubchu Drubdey (dNgos-grub-chu sgrub-sde). He received a letter of acknowledgement concerning the gold that he had sent earlier to be offered to the Jowo Statue of Lhasa. He subsequently passed away. A 'merit-dedication request' (bsngo zhu) for the deceased was immediately brought to Jamgon; and was also offered to all lamas of Bhutan. J amgon himself conducted the dedication and aspiration prayers for his deceased brother; he made many offerings to the monk community and served them tea. Presided over by the Je Khenpo Ngawang Thinley and other senior monks, funeral rites for Ngawang Pekar were performed, including ritual prayers dedicated to the Buddha Ak~obhya. Many additional ritual services were performed in memory of Ngawang Pekar. When Ngawang Pekar was still alive, he had begun to make copper statues of Guru Padmasambhava and of drubchen Terkhungpa but the work had not been completed before his sudden demise.280 This task was now taken up by Jamgon who was able to complete it in a perfect manner, enshrining inside each statue many precious relics.

On the Fifteenth Day of the First Month of the Iron-Female-Pig Year, corresponding to 1731, Gyalse Trillku Jigme Norbu finally received his full ordination with J amgon acting as his preceptor in the presence of a congregation of monks. He then assumed the highest post in the country as the Gyaltshab of Bhutan. The occasion was celebrated with the making of elaborate offerings to the monk community. In the years following his full ordination, Gyalse Trulku' s faith in and respect for the Je Khenpo, the Lopons and the monk community became even more profound. Gyalse Trulku commissioned the erection of an exquisite Buddha image two cubits high (i.e. measuring twice the length from elbow to tip of the middle fmger), as well as a four-armed Mahakala image made from copper which was one cubit high. To ensure completion of this noble undertaking, J amgon also contributed thirteen zho (weight of a gold coin) of gold.

Although J amgon wished to meet the Karmapa and the Zhamarpa in person, he was unable to do so on account of illness. Through one of his attendants, he therefore sent a silver cup and other presents to the two visiting guests.

Gyalse Triilku could not think of separating himself from Jamgon, as he felt he was like a son to Jamgon, who had proved to be as affectionate and generous to him as his own father; nonetheless with high respect, he accepted that Jamgon would leave. Gyalse Triilku invited Jamgon to visit him at his residence before he left. When Jamgon arrived, Gyalse Triilku seated him on a decorated throne and then made numerous offerings to him in including the Seven-chaptered Prayer of Longevity which he chanted with folded hands. Jamgon left Punakha and arrived at his retreat residence where he remained in constant meditation. At this time he offered a silk brocade robe intricately patterned with golden dragons and a silk canopy to the Buddha image in the Eight-Pillared Temple (ka brgyad lha khang) in Wangdii Phodrang Dzong.

J amgon said: \"I am not only very old but also visually impaired; earlier I had no' problem. Whatever it may be, I shall try my best to carry it out.\" Having spoken thus, he offered the reading transmission of the Bhadrakalpika-satra and the Lalitavistara-satra (rGya cher rol pa; Sutra of the Vast Display), Noticing Jamgon's remarkable reading speed, Je Khenpo Ngawang Thinley briefly commented: \"Now [it seems that] you have restored yourself to a younger age for the benefit of sentient beings.\" Jamgon replied: \"Earlier, when I read Dharma texts, I would never fall asleep, but now I do; it seems that now the time has arrived for me to die.\" Then, as an auspicious sign, Jamgon said that he would begin with reading transmission of the 'Ka' Section [ofthe Kwjur]. He spoke thus because he had a premonition that he would not be able to complete the reading transmission of the entire work before he passed away. Due to his spiritual maturity, his countenance became brighter and he looked more healthy; some of his hair, which earlier was grey, now turned black; formerly he had not a single tooth [in his mouth], but now, two pearl-coloured teeth shaped like a chorten appeared in his mouth; while giving transmission, though earlier he could not read more than one hundred pages in a day as he became tired, miraculously he could now accomplish one hundred pages within a short span of time. To many people, this was a sign that he would not pass away soon. The disciples requested Jamgon to prolong his life and continue to work for the well-being of sentient beings, to which Jamgon replied: I do not know whether my activities have benefited sentient beings or not dming my life; now of my life span there remains only this much, even if I live long, so it will be difficult to [further] benefit sentient beings. You therefore should not let yourselves be influenced by disturbing emotions; since Dharma without meditation will not help in attaining enlightenment, carryon with your practice assiduously.
