There are many commentaries on the Treasury. The great Chim Jamyangs commentary and the Eighth Karmapa Mikyo Dorjes commentary, The Springtime Cow o f Easy Accomplishment are very clear and good, but they are too long. W hen new students study them, they are unable to find a way into them. In order to help such students, the N inth Karmapa W angchuk Dorje composed a commentary that is very clear and concise. Students who read it are able to develop definite comprehension of the abhidharm a in general, and within that, clearly understand the points taught in the Treasury o f Abhidharma. T hat is why it is so beneficial that the N inth Karmapa Wangchuk Dorjes commentary on the Treasury has been translated.Among the three baskets of Buddhist teachings, it is im portant to under­stand the abhidharma teachings. There are three main trainings: the superior training in discipline taught by the vinaya, the superior training in samadhi taught by the sutras, and the superior training in full knowing taught by the abhidharma. O f these three trainings, the prim ary one for destroying the afflictions and attaining the ultimate result is the superior training in full knowing. Developing this training depends mainly on the pitaka of abhidharma, and that in turn depends mainly on the treatises of abhidharma. O f all these treatises, the easiest and clearest is the Treasury o f Abhidharma, so if you study the Treasury, it will bring great benefit.Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche Sarnath, India February 17 , 2008"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"1Translator’s IntroductionEnglish-speaking students of Buddhism are very fortunate these days: there are more and more books on Buddhism, and in-depth study o f Buddhist philosophy and practice is becoming possible in an English medium. Im por­tant texts from all Buddhist schools and traditions, in particular the Indian and Tibetan, are becoming available in excellent, clear English translations that are understandable and beneficial for general readers and specialists alike. Since many students of Buddhism are primarily interested in meditation, many o f the texts initially translated focused on m editation. But in order to receive the full benefits of m editation practice, it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the views o f Buddhist philosophy. As Master Vasubandhu says in the Treasury ofAbhidharma:W ith conduct, listening, contemplation,Completely train in meditation.In other words, in order to achieve results in our meditation practice, we must first m aintain the conduct of good discipline and then develop the prajna or “full knowing” born of listening and contemplation through study of the Buddhas words and the treatises that explain them. W ithout study we are like blind people trying to climb a cliff, it is said, but with the proper understand­ing that comes from thorough study and contemplation, our meditation will improve and we will be able to enjoy its fruits.O f all the subjects to study, masters in all Buddhist traditions consider the abhidharma to be one of the most important. Abhidharma is like an encyclo­pedia of Buddhism: it pulls together the teachings the Buddha gave in many different sutras and discourses and presents them in a systematic way. Studying"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"translator’s introductionit gives an understanding o f what things are and why they are called by the names they are given. It provides a solid foundation for further study because other treatises often refer to concepts and phenomena that are covered most thoroughly in the abhidharma. But most important, it gives answers to such pressing questions as, what are the natures of our bodies and minds? How are we born? How do our minds work? How does karma work? W hat causes suf­fering? How do we free ourselves from suffering?Although the Buddha himself said that his teachings could be divided into the three baskets of sutras, vinaya, and abhidharma, it would be difficult to pinpoint a specific set of his discourses that could be called abhidharma. Rather, Shariputra, Kátyániputra, and other arhats collected and systematized the teachings the Buddha had given on many disparate occasions in many su­tras and the vinaya, compiling what are called the seven treatises o f abhidharma. As the different schools of Buddhism developed, each school also developed its own tradition of interpreting and explaining the abhidharma, and so there came to be several distinct presentations of the abhidharma.T he basis for the study o f abhidharm a in the northern Buddhist tradi­tions that spread to Tibet, China, Korea, and Japan was provided by Master Vasubandhu’s Verses on the Treasury o f Abhidharma (often called the root verses) and his accompanying Explanation o f the Treasury o f Abhidharma (usu­ally called the autocommentary). Written in the fourth century, these brilliant works eclipsed earlier treatises on the abhidharm a to such an extent that Tibetan translators did not even consider most of the treatises it was based upon necessary to translate. W ithin the Tibetan tradition, Vasubandhu’s Treasury is considered one of the five great works of Buddhist philosophy. The root is especially prized for the way in which it condenses an immense topic into clean concise, and memorable verses. Several of the verses are so often quoted in works on other topics that they are among the most com­monly quoted lines in Tibetan Buddhism. W hen studying abhidharma, stu­dents memorize the root— in some m onastic colleges, gathering every m orning to recite the verses aloud from beginning to end. The meter of the verses makes them easy to recite and remember, so that as students recite them over and over, passages that at first seem impenetrable become clearer and clearer. Eventually they become reminders that flow easily over the tongue, bringing to m ind the meaning described in the commentaries.For a student new to the abhidharma, however, Vasubandhu’s work on its own is difficult. The root verses are like a key that opens the gate to a vast field of knowledge, but they are too terse to understand without explanation. O n the other hand, the autocommentary is imposing for beginners. N ot only is it lengthy— one English translation was published in four volumes— it"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"translator’s introductioncovers many doctrinal disputes between different Buddhist schools in such detail that beginners m ight find it difficult to discern what is im portant. O ther points are given only cursory explanation, as if it is assumed that the reader already knows the point or that a master will explain it.For these reasons among others, many Indian and later Tibetan masters wrote commentaries on either the root verses, the autocommentary, or both. Among these, the N inth Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje’s explanation of the root verses entitled Youthful Play is especially useful for those who are new to the abhidharma. About a third the length of the autocommentary, its explana­tions o f the root verses are succinct and clear; its synopses of the disputes between different schools outline the m ain points w ithout providing so m uch detail that a new student might get confused; and it fleshes out several topics covered only briefly in the autocomm entary. Youthful Play gives a thorough overview o f the abhidharm a for those who wish to study it but cannot do so exhaustively and provides a basis for those who wish to delve further into abhidharm a studies.W hen most students o f Buddhism first learn about the abhidharma, at first it seems as if it is a set of scriptures— one of the three baskets or pitaka of the Buddhist canon. However, this is only one aspect of what the word abhidharma refers to. In Vasubandhu’s presentation, there are three types of abhidharma: ultimate abhidharma, path abhidharma, and scriptural abhid­harma. Ultimate or genuine abhidharma is the stainless, undefiled full know­ing that correctly discerns what is and what is not, as well as the five undefiled aggregates which accompany it. The name abhidharma is also given to the defiled full knowing and treatises through which one can achieve stainless wisdom. The defiled full knowing of individuals on the path is path abhid­harma, and treatises such as the seven treatises o f abhidharm a and this Treasury are scriptural abhidharma.The reason it is im portant to study the abhidharma is that only this unde­filed full knowing can liberate us from the suffering of samsara. Ordinary sen­tient beings lack this full knowing and are unable to properly distinguish what is from what is not. This confusion leads to greed for the things one wants and aversion toward things one finds unpleasant. This in turn leads to the ac­tions which on a longer timeframe bind us to the cycle of rebirth, but in the short term as well lead to the difficulties of our lives. One only has to look at how many of our everyday problems— whether major or petty, real or imag­ined— result from misunderstandings or misplaced hopes and fears to see how im portant it is to develop the wisdom that sees what is as it is. As Vasubandhu says near the beginning of the Treasury:"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"translator’s introductionW ithout full discernment of dharmas, there is not Any m ethod to totally quell the afflictions.Because of afflictions, the world wanders the seas of existence.Although the necessity for studying the treatise is to realize the undefiled full knowing that correctly discerns dharmas, the actual topic is all defiled and un­defiled dharmas— in effect, all dharmas, as there are no dharmas which are neither defiled nor undefiled. As Wangchuk Dorje notes in his commentary, the reason to divide dharmas into these two categories is to indicate which dharmas we need to give up and which dharmas we need to adopt in order to bring ourselves to liberation and happiness. Defiled dharmas are those dhar­mas in relation to which our defilements or afflictions can occur and are pri­marily the dharmas included in the two truths o f suffering and origin. Undefiled dharmas include the truths of cessation and path— those dharmas, which when we understand them correctly, either are liberation or bring us to liberation.Following a brief overview that identifies defiled and undefiled dharmas, the Treasury then presents eight areas or chapters.1 The first area, “Teachings on the Elements,” gives an overview of the classification of all phenomena into the aggregates (skandha:), sense bases (,dyatana:), and elements (<dhatu). It then further classifies dharmas by what realm they are present in; whether they are virtuous, nonvirtuous, or neutral; how they are produced; and so forth. The second area, “Teachings on the Faculties,” presents an overview of the sensory and other faculties, mental factors, nonconcurrent formations, and causes, re­sults, and conditions. Taken together, these two areas provide a general cate­gorization of all phenomena and demonstrate how phenomena relate to one another as perceiver and perceived, cause and result, and so forth.The next area, “Teachings on the World,” gives a presentation of sentient beings and the world that contains them. Although many Western texts call this “Buddhist cosmology,” Tibetan commentaries say that this is a presenta­tion of the truth of suffering: by understanding what possible rebirths there are, how one is reborn, and the places one can be reborn, one can see how none of these transcend impermanence and suffering. The first half of the area describes the different types of wanderers, or sentient beings, and explains how they take birth, what sustains them during their lives, and how they die. This includes a thorough explanation of the between or bardo state and the twelve links of interdependence. The second half of the area presents the arrangement o f the outer world with M ount M eru surrounded by rings o f mountains, oceans, and continents, including detailed descriptions of the god realms above and the hell realms below.xiv"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"translator’s introductionThis area is one of the most fascinating for Tibetans and non-Tibetans alike, not least because the description of the outer world does not match our m od­ern understanding of the physical universe. M any modern Tibetan khenpos and scholars explain that this is because our common perceptions of the world arise out of our shared karma. Since beings today have different karma than those of Vasubandhu’s time, the world naturally appears quite differently to us today. Another possible explanation is that the Buddha and later scholars including Vasubandhu needed to teach in ways that the people of their time could understand, and therefore they described the world according to the prevalent beliefs of their times. However we reconcile ourselves to this, at the very least this area is rich with descriptions of the mountains, seas, and places that provide much of the imagery of Buddhist literature.The fourth and fifth areas then present the causes for the world as we know it to arise: karma and the afflictions, which are the two parts of the truth of origin. The fourth area, “Teachings on Karma,” explains all the different as­pects of karma: what the virtuous and nonvirtuous actions are, what gives them their karmic strength, and how their results are experienced. The fifth area, “Teachings on the Kernels,” analyzes all the different aspects of the afflic­tions, focusing on the afflicted kernels, the subtle seeds of the afflictions within our beings that can flare up into full blown afflictions— the defilements, floods, yokes, and graspings also described in this chapter. This area describes in detail what the kernels focus on, how they tie us to samsara, how they de­velop into manifest afflictions, and so forth. As Vasubandhu says, “The root of existence is the kernels,” so fully understanding them is critical to under­standing why we remain in samsara and how we can free ourselves from it. For this reason, it is not uncom m on to hear Tibetan scholars say that this is the most im portant area in the Treasury. The fifth area also discusses how to abandon the kernels and the result of abandoning them, the perfect knowings that are the truth of cessation.2The truth of the path is taught in the first part of the sixth area, “Teachings on the Paths and Individuals,” which describes the meditations one follows from the beginning stages of the ordinary individual through the paths of see­ing and meditation. The four parts of the path of joining— the precursors to clear realization— and the path of seeing are described in particular detail. The area also describes the qualities and results that arise on the path, the results of the spiritual way, and the different types of noble individuals in the listener vehicle.The last two chapters, “Teachings on W isdom” and “Teachings on Absorp­tion,” describe the wisdom and deep meditation that arise in different indi­viduals, presenting the qualities of the Buddha and arhats. Knowing aboutxv"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"translator’s introductiontheir qualities helps create enthusiasm for practicing the path: If we do not feel that there will be any benefit to listening, contemplating, and meditating, it will be hard to motivate ourselves to make the necessary effort. But if we understand what kinds of qualities we can attain, then we will have joy at the prospects of following the path to liberation.Thus the eight areas collect the Buddhas teachings into a treasury that we can use and enjoy. It covers a vast scope— the natures of phenomena, the na­tures of our minds and bodies, why we exist as we do, and how we can free ourselves— but as Wangchuk Dorje says, Master Vasubandhu is “skilled in concise and simple words, and composed a text with few difficult words.” To­gether with the Karmapas clear explanations, it truly is what Wangchuk Dorje calls a “feast for those with intelligence and interest.”The translation of these works has occupied me intermittently over the last few years since 2005, a period one could argue is not really long enough to fully penetrate a topic some scholars spend decades studying. Yet I hope that by these efforts English speakers will be able to begin an exploration of the abhidharma. May they be able to bathe in the cooling waters of the oceans of abhidharm a and cleanse themselves o f the stains of misunderstanding and wrong view. May they develop the confident full knowing born of study and contemplation and then progress down the paths of meditation. May all who read these words soon be free of all the sufferings and difficulties of this life and live within the greatest ease and contentment. Sarva mangalam!xvi"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"A T^ote on the ‘Translation o f the Tgot TersesO ne of the peculiar qualities of Vasubandhus Verses on the Treasury o f Ahhidharma is its extreme concision, both in the original Sanskrit and in the Tibetan translation. T he root verses do not give full explanations of most points. Instead, they give short reminders— sometimes only a short phrase or a single word— that help the student organize and remember the large body o f knowledge presented in the commentaries. As such, they are brilliant and helpful both during the process of studying the abhidharma and later for re­membering it, but difficult to penetrate at first.For this reason, many contemporary translators of texts such as this take the approach of filling in the root verses to make them more understandable— adding words or phrases from the commentaries so that it can be understood on the first pass. This can certainly be helpful, but if one were to insert enough extra language to make every line of this particular text immediately clear, the resulting translation would read more like a prose commentary than the orig­inal verses; it would lack the concision and rhythm that make the Tibetan so memorable.This translation takes a different approach, following— albeit imperfectly— the example set by the Indian master Jinamitra and the great Tibetan translator Bande Kawa Paltsek in the Tibetan translation. It is an attempt to match both the structure and content of Vasubandhu s verses as closely as possible in Eng­lish. Where Vasubandhu is concise, this translation is similarly concise. Where the antecedents of pronouns are not specified in the original, they are left un­specified here. Just as the original is metered verse, this translation is also set in meter in order to make it easier to remember and recite. In Vasubandhus original and in the Tibetan translation there are many lines that only make"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"A NOTE ON THE TRANSLATION OF THE ROOT VERSESsense after one looks at a commentary, and readers will find this English trans­lation similar in this regard as well. T hat being said, I have also tried to avoid being too literal in the translation, as in many passages too strict an adherence to the Sanskrit and Tibetan grammar and versification would have rendered the English unnecessarily opaque. For this reason the meter of the English translation is less regular than the original, some stanzas have extra lines, and other liberties have been taken.People reading abhidharma for the first time may find it helpful to compare the root text as they read it to Wangchuk Dorje’s commentary, which explains all the words of the root in the order they appear in the verses. Students who are studying the text in-depth may want to recite the root verses aloud and consult the other commentaries available in English. I hope that as students grow more familiar with the verses and their explanations, they might have moments such as I had studying this text in Tibetan, when passages that had seemed inscrutable suddenly became clear and the beauty of Vasubandhu s argument and manner became apparent.xviii"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CAcknowledgmentsI am deeply grateful to Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, who has supported, encouraged, and helped me in all ways while I have been translating this, and to Khenpo Losal of the Vajra Vidya Institute, who taught the class in which I first studied these texts and later helped clarify many points.

For that reason, I have attained some slight bit of ability to comment on the thought of the buddhas, bodhisattvas, heroes, yoginis, and masters of practice.W hether you classify the True Dharma as explaining, debating, and com­posing, or as listening, contemplating, meditating, as a cause to practice the Dharma it is necessary to have as one’s master someone who has received the instructions passed down from the Lord Buddha in an unbroken stream through the liberated holders of the lineage. W ithout this, one can practice, but as the stream of the teachings has been broken, blessings will not arise.

According to the tradition passed down from the great Ngok Lotsawa, it is not necessary to explain the lineage from the perfect Buddha to the earlier masters. Why? you ask. Master Vasubandhu listened to all the vehicles of the dharma from his elder brother Noble Asanga, and he from Lord Maitreya, who listened to them from perfect Buddha— a very short lin­eage.

The Buddha, for example, is both, and those other than them are neither.To say a few words to elaborate on this, there are three points: i) Identifying the Teacher who is the object of homage; 2) Obscurations that hinder attaining buddhahood; and 3) The antidote to abandon those.First, identifying the Teacher who is the object o f homage: The one who is the Teacher here is the complete perfect Buddha. To recognize his nature, it is the dharma body alone, which is the truth of the path with the five undefiled ag­gregates. The schools9 do not say that this body supports the form bodies of enjoyment or emanation. The schools also do not agree that the bodily support on which the amrita nectar of enlightenment has been attained, such as the flesh of Prince Siddharta, is a Buddha, because it is the full ripening of karma and afflictions. Similarly, a bhikshu, too, is posited to be the bhikshu vows, not the individual who holds them. Likewise, learners, nonlearners, and nobles are said to be the truth of the path, not the individuals. To call the individual a buddha or bhikshu is to call that which is supported by the name of that which supports it. It is like, for example, the designations “goldsmith” and«1 »horseman.The Sutra school says that one can assert that the form body is characteris­tically the buddha. One does this optionally in situations where one does not wish to distinguish the path from the individual, or else when positing that the Buddha as he is generally thought of is merely the one to whom one goes for refuge. They do not, however, accept that this is the actual Buddha, be­cause in their school the form body is posited as something to discard and as defiled.Second, obscurations that hinder attaining buddhahood: The word “darkness” in the verse is a metaphor for the obscurations, because just as darkness hinders97"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY # AREA Iseeing, the obscurations also hinder seeing the correct meaning. There are two types of obscurations here: afflictive obscurations that primarily obscure lib­eration, and nonafflicted obscurations that primarily obscure omniscience. The first is held to be the six kernels10 that are the root of existence, the cog­nitions that are concurrent with them, and their attainment. The Sutra school proposes that liberation is a no-negation,11 the mere absence of that which cre­ates suffering or obscures omniscience, but here it is presented as a thing. In this situation, it cannot be said to be either material or cognitive.The second, nonafflictive obscuration, is primarily the mental factor delu­sion that is an impediment to all-knowing. It has the characteristic of cognitive obscuration and has four types: i) not knowing because the Buddhas qualities are profound and subtle; 2) not knowing by being fully removed from the ob­ject; 3) not knowing by being fully removed from the time; and 4) not know­ing because the classifications of meaning are infinite. Shariputra, for example, has the first and third; Maudgalyana, for example, has the second; and Noble Rahula has the fourth. From the commentary:12In this way, they are extremely removed from the Buddhas qualities, object, and time, and they have nonafflicted unknowing of the infinite classifications of meaning.Well then, do the listeners and self-buddhas conquer the darkness taught here or not? If they do that darkness could not be proven to be something only the Buddha abandons. If they do not, they would not have made an end to suf­fering. This is because it is said in a sutra:If I did not clearly know, did not completely know one dharma, I would not say I have made an end to suffering... If I did not completely know and discard one dharma, I would not say I have made an end to suffering...So you might say. These two faults cause no harm, because listener and self- buddha arhats conquer nonafflictive darkness, but do not conquer it entirely. This is because it is said in the commentary:O f course we agree that they conquer the darkness to ail, but not entirely.Here we do not assert the presentation of cognitive obscurations as the concept98"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"TEACHINGS ON THE ELEMENTSof perceived and perceiver explained in the Great Vehicle, but we must assert the designation cognitive obscuration because there are both scriptural and logical proofs. First, the scriptural proof: with regards to the verse, “At once, there are never two, like Buddhas,”13 Purnavardhana explains, “They are free of afflicted obscurations, so they are equal, but they are not equally equal because they are not free o f cognitive obscurations.” Second, the logical proof: holding the coarse and the continuum as substantial, obscurations that hinder refining faculties, holding dharmas o f exclusion as not empty of their essence, holding the aggregates and so forth to be wholes, obscurations to the six perfections, obscurations to the attainm ent of final absorptions, and the four causes of unknowing are posited to be cognitive obscurations, because they are cognitions that are deluded about the nature but are not afflicted cognitions.The schools also do not reject the selflessness of phenomena and thatness, because they assert the four seals that proclaim the view, and the thatness of things. However, they do not assert the selflessness of phenomena pervaded by emptiness of perceived and perceiver that is renowned in the Great Vehicle.Third, analyzing the antidote: The actual antidote that discards the four causes of unknowing is asserted to be the nonlearners wisdom of the ten pow­ers, because previously on the learners paths there is no full knowing that per­ceives in a way that is exclusive of their essence.14Well then, the Buddha may have abandoned the four causes of unknowing, but he has not abandoned their attainm ent, which he must still possess, you say.15 This is not a fault, because the arising of the future wisdom of the Buddha and the cessation of the present attainm ent of the four causes of un­knowing are simultaneous— when the wisdom arises, the attainm ent of the four causes ceases, just as when you light a lamp, darkness is dispelled.2.

In the autocommentary:99"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA I“Full knowing” is full discernment of dharmas. “Stain­less” is undefiled. “Along with its following” includes what accompanies it, the five undefiled aggregates. This is what is taught as abhidharma. At this point, this is ultimate abhidharma.Path abhidharma is that by which one attains it, the ultimate abhidharma, or that which is clearly directed toward its realization. From the auto­commentary:Because it is clearly directed toward the characteristics of dharmas, it is abhidharma.W hat is meant here by “that which” is the full knowing of nonnobles on the path: the defiled full knowing of listening, contemplating, and meditating, along with its following of the other aggregates that are associated with it. This can either arise from training or be attained upon birth.The treatises that teach those topics by which one gains it, stainless full knowing, is textual abhidharma. In the Prince’s commentary17 it says, “Others say that what is called the ‘Treatise’ is Jndnaprasthdna. ..T he m eaning o f the title: W hy is this treatise called The Treasury o f Abhidharma? Since this treatise collects them, the essential points of the seven treatises of abhidharm a including the ocean of expositions, com pletely in m eaning, or else since they, the seven treatises of abhidharma, are its, this treatise’s, base, it is called The Treasury o f Abhidharma. The meaning is taught here through the examples of a base and a treasury.3. Teaching the necessity and purpose3. W ithout full discernment of dharmas, there is not Any m ethod to thoroughly quell the afflictions.Because of afflictions, the .world wanders the seas of existence. That is why the Teacher taught this, they claim.All treatises have a topic, necessity, vital necessity, and connection. The topic of abhidharma is explicitly taught by the word dharmasy which is explained as all that is defiled or undefiled. Alternatively the principal meaning of the topic is full knowing that is full discernment of dharmas. The necessity is to easily realize this full knowing that is full discernment of dharmas.The text teaches the vital necessity in the negative; the actual, positive vital necessity is implied. W ithout what is necessary, the full knowing that is fullioo"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"TEACHINGS ON THE ELEMENTSdiscernment of defiled and undefiled dharmas, there are afflictions which can­not be abandoned. W hy is that? Because without that full knowing there is not any m ethod to totally quell the afflictions. Because o f the afflictions, the worldly beings accumulate karma and w ander the great seas o f existence. They do not achieve freedom, and that, helping them attain freedom, is why the Teacher taught this abhidharma.And so here, from among the four of the topic, necessity, vital necessity, and connection, the first is principally full knowing that fully discerns defiled and undefiled dharmas. The second is to easily realize that full knowing on the basis of this treatise. The third is to attain nirvana on the basis of that re­alization. The fourth is that the latter are attained through the former. The way they are taught in the treatise is as follows: “Dharmas” teaches the topic. “Full discernment” teaches the necessity. “W ith o u t...” and “there are afflic­tions” teach the vital necessity obliquely. The connection is implicitly taught.Well then, who first taught this abhidharma? you ask. In the tradition of the Great Exposition school, the seven treatises of abhidharma were first spo­ken in sections by the Teacher in various lands and to various individuals. Later, seven arhats collected them into treatises. For example, it is like the Uddnavarga, a collection of verses spoken by the Teacher at different times and compiled by the m onk Dharmatrata. The seven treatises are Jndnaprasthdna by Katyaniputra, Prakaranapada by Vasumitra, Vijnanakdya by Devaksema, Dharmaskandha by Shariputra, Prajnaptisastra by Maudga- lyayana, Dhatukdya by Vasumitra, and Samgitiparyaya by Mahakausthila. Purnavardhana lists it alternatively as “Samgitiparyaya by Shariputra.” If the abhidharma were not the words of the Buddha, even though it says in the sutras, “Bhikshus, these are the three baskets,” the three baskets would be incomplete.The phrase “T hey claim” is a skeptical phrase from the Sutra school: in these treatises there are various wrong positions such as the proposition that noncomposites are substantial. As the Teacher did not say anything erro­neous, these are the fabrications of the masters who assembled the abhidharma, they say.4. Explaining the actual body of the treatise. This has two topics: a. Present­ing the body, and b. Extensively explaining the limbs.a. Presenting th e body. This has two topics: i. An overview, and ii. An explanation.IOI"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA Ii. Overview4a Defiled and undefiled dharmas:Having said that dharmas are the topic of this treatise, what are they? you ask. The presentation “Defiled and undefiled dharmas” teaches everything con­cisely as a mutual exclusion.18 This is an actual exclusion, because there is no third possibility. Well then, it would be logical to recite, “Composite and non­composite are dharmas” you say. This is not a fault, because saying “defiled” teaches what is to be rejected and “undefiled” teaches what should be mostly taken up, so it is recited in this way to teach that.Here, the undefiled is not set forth as a no-negation, a mere absence of de­filements, because a mere absence cannot be a thing, so it does not hold its own characteristics. W ithout holding those, it is not appropriate to be a dharma, because a dharma is characterized as that which holds its own essence. Dharmas are pervasively19 things, and things must be either composite or noncomposite. Dharmas are pervasively things, because as it says in the auto­commentary:T he Sutra school says there are no noncomposites among things, and in the Abhidharma also it says,“W hat are dharmas that are not things, you say? They are noncomposite dharmas.” But the Great Exposi- tionists say that is not what this means. Well then, what does it mean? you say. There are five types of things: natural things, focused things, possessed things, causal things, and completely grasped things. In this passage, the term causal thing is meant. Therefore non­composites are solely substantial, and they also have neither causes nor results.This explains noncomposites to be things and substantial. Noncomposite dharmas are also able to perform a function, because although they cannot perform the function of producing a result, they are able to perform the func­tion of supporting.If something is composite, it is not pervasively arisen, because there are fu­ture composites. N ot only that, it is not pervasively going to arise, because one must assert that there are future nonarising phenom ena.20ii. The explanation. This has two topics: (1) Explaining the defiled, and (2) Explaining the undefiled.102"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"TEACHINGS ON THE ELEMENTS(1) Explaining the defiled4 b -d Except the truth of path, composites Are defiled since defilements can Develop in relation to them.Except for the truth of the path, composites are defiled. Saying this eliminates the possibility that the Truth of the Path and noncomposites could be defiled. All that is other than those is only defiled. Why? you ask. Since defiledments21 and near afflictions can develop in relation to them , the composites except for the path, in terms of either focus or concurrence.22 Therefore, the charac­teristic of the defiled is a dharma on which defilements can develop through either focus or concurrence. Its character base23 is composites except the truth of the path. If something is defiled the defilements do not pervasively develop in relation to it in those two ways. For example, even though arhats have aban­doned defilements they still have a defiled body, but the defilements do not develop in relation to their bodies.(2) Explaining the undefiled. This has two topics: (a) Overview, and (b) Spe­cific explanation of noncomposites.(a) Overview5a—c The undefiled is the truth of pathAnd the three noncomposites, too,W hich are space and the two cessations.T he character base of undefiled dharmas is the tru th of the path and the three types of noncomposites. Their characteristic is a dharma on which defilements cannot develop through either focus or concurrence. The word “too” means that just as composite has classifications and dharmas can be counted as either defiled or undefiled, noncomposite dharmas also can be counted as three: they are space and the two cessations.Some say that this text does not teach that noncomposite dharmas are defi­nitely divided into three. This is not logical: from the Prince’s commentary:“W hat are the three types of noncomposites? you say,” is a question posed because the answer is not universally known. To say “three types” is to identify them as just these three. Some— those in the school of Vatsiputra— say, however, that the only noncomposite is nirvana.103"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA IThe Particularists24 propone noncomposite atoms and many such noncomposites. In order to refute their scriptural traditions, noncomposites are identified to be just these.25(b) Specific explanation of noncom posites. This has three points.(i) Space5d Space is that which does not obstruct them.O f these three types of noncomposites, according to the Exposition school the characteristic of space is that which is a noncomposite thing that does not obstruct them , those phenom ena with form, and that opens the gate to the arising. Among the three, virtue and so forth, its essence is unobscured neutral.26(ii) Analytic cessation6ab Cessation that is analyticIs a removal. They are distinct.Cessation that is analytic is cessation attained by the power of analyzing suf­fering and the other noble truths with full knowing. Its essence is a cessation that is a removal of defiled dharmas. 27The classifications of analytic cessation: Is the cessation of all defiled dhar­mas one or separate? you ask. They, the different analytic cessations, are dis­tinct: there are just as many substances of removal (cessations) as substances that had been possessed. There are five separate classes of discards28 and there are five separate classes of antidotes. Therefore, there are five separate analytic cessations.(in) Nonanalytic cessation6 cd The other cessation blocks arising Forever; it’s nonanalytic.The essence of nonanalytic cessation is a cessation that is other than analytic cessation and blocks the arising of the future composite that is negated for­ever. To explain the term, it is set forth as cessation attained by power that is no t analytic full knowing: it is not attained by the power of individually104"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"TEACHINGS ON THE ELEMENTSanalyzing the aspects of the four truths but rather is attained by the power of conditions not being met.For example, when your m ind is distracted by some other form, if there is a crow behind you where you cannot see it, a cognition that perceives the crow does not arise. Later when you are no longer distracted and the cognition could arise, the crow has flown off someplace else. Therefore the eye conscious­ness that sees the crow has become a future nonarising dharma base.b. Extensively explaining the limbs. This has two topics: i. An overview of the eight areas, and ii. Teaching the meaning of each area.i. An overview of the eight areas. This has three points.(1) Establishing the numberThe first two areas give a general presentation of defiled and undefiled dhar- mas. Following that, the middle three areas give specific explanations of defiled all-afflicted dharmas. The last three areas present specific explanations of un­defiled perfectly pure dharmas. This presents everything defiled and undefiled that individuals must focus on as they progress through the paths, and what­ever is not included in earlier chapters is taught in the later. These completely explain the necessary meaning, and thus the num ber of chapters is established as eight. Generally, by dividing the topics into eight chapters, the different topics can be combined into a coherent whole.(2) Establishing the orderThe order and connections between the areas was explained extensively by Narthangpa Sherdrag, who composed the verses that begin, “Just this desire for liberation,” and continue until the lines, “The treasury that teaches ab- sorption/Is taught after that.”29The order can be known from these, but to summarize in brief, the primary topic of abhidharma— the presentation of aggregates (skandha)y elements (dhatu)y and sense bases (dyatana)— is explained first in the treasury that teaches elements. T hat ends with a m ention o f the word faculties, so next there follows an extensive explanation of those in the treasury that teaches fac­ulties. That chapter mentions the names of the three realms, so an explanation of those follows in the treasury that teaches the world. O ne might wonder whether these various worlds arise without a cause. They do not. In order to explain that they arise out o f karma, next comes the treasury that teaches105"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA Ikarma. Karma can only produce a fully ripened result if there are afflictions, so to explain that, next comes the treasury that teaches the kernels. As Purnavardhana says:The childish ride the chariot of birth,W hich has the wheels of karma and afflictions,But without the one wheel of the afflictions,The single wheel of karma cannot turn.This chapter also explains that when the afflictions are abandoned, perfect knowings arise. In order to explain that the afflictions are abandoned by paths and individuals, next is the treasury that teaches the paths and individuals. This chapter explains dharma knowing and subsequent knowing alone, so in order to give an extensive presentation of all ten knowings, next comes the treasury that teaches wisdom. That treasury explains the Buddhas unshared qualities, and so in order to explain the qualities of the absorptions and so forth shared in common with learners, next comes the treasury that teaches the absorptions. Elaborating on the final statement, “All those who want free­dom, be careful,”30 the Commentary then explains the logic refuting the indi­vidual self in a ninth area.(3) What topic is taught in which areaThis is known from each individual area.

The character base of composites7 ab Composite dharmas are the five Skandhas of form, et cetera.In the above verse, “Except the truth of path, composites,” the character base for the composites m entioned is composite dharmas that are made by many causes and conditions coming together and meeting. They are the five skand­has of form, et cetera— the aggregates of feeling, conception,32 formation, and consciousness.B. Synonyms7cd Just these are time, the bases for talk,Emancipatible, and grounded.All the teachers of abhidharma explained and systematized the sutras.

All composites.” W hat is the meaning of these? you ask.Just these composites are called time, or adhva. The word adhva means either “time” or “path.” In the meaning of “path,” composites are like the paths by which an individual went, is going, or will go to the market. In the meaning of “time,” the composites of the three times are called “time” because they have ceased, are ceasing, or will cease. Alternately, as they are consumed by imper­manence, they are called “time.”Composites are either directly or indirectly the topic of speech, so they are called the bases for talk. They are called emancipatible, because if one tran­scends these composites, nirvana will be attained. A nd they are also called grounded because they have causes.C.

The defiled is the aggregatesO f grasping and is disputed, too.They re suffering, origin, and the world,Locus of views, existence, too.Among these composites, that which is explained as defiled is the aggregates o f grasping, because grasping is afflicted, and the aggregates possess grasping in three ways: i) Grasping is the afflictions, by which one accumulates karma107"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY f r AREA Iout of which the aggregates arise, so calling them the aggregates of grasping is like saying “grass and a hay fire.” 2) Because the aggregates produce the afflic­tions, it is like saying “flowering tree” or “fruit tree.” 3) The aggregates are ob­tained by engaging objects under the power of afflictions, so it is like saying “the King’s men.”They are called disputed, too: afflictions, just like worldly disputes, harm oneself and others, so they are disputes. Because the aggregates increase those, they are disputed.As they possess the three sufferings and are incompatible with nobles, they are also called suffering. Nobles see that the third suffering, the suffering of formation that pervades all composites, is ultimately suffering.As suffering originates from these, they are also called the origin. As they are supported on something that disintegrates, they are called the “disinte­grating support” or w orld.33 As views develop by focusing on them, they are called the locus o f views. From beginningless time, in the way of causally com­patible cause and result they have been born without interruption and arise again, they are also called existence, so they are called by these synonyms, too.II.

Overview9ab The skandha of form: five faculties,Five objects, the imperceptible.Above where it says, “the five / Skandhas of form, et cetera,” the skandha of form mentioned is the five faculties of eye and so forth, the five objects of form and so forth, and the imperceptible form34 to make exactly eleven.These dharmas, the eleven dissimilar things, are called form and character­ized as the same with the characteristic of appropriate for form. The meaning of this is set forth as “able to be damaged.” The meaning of that in turn is that they can be destroyed or conquered. This in turn means that through the in­ternal collision of forms, they become dissimilar to the previous form— they are susceptible to the damage of production. Alternatively, the meaning of ap­propriate for form is obstructive.Well then, should not atoms be inappropriate for form, you say? Atoms are either substance or sense base. O f these two, in the first case, the particles of the eight substances and so forth are not simultaneously assembled in a single atom. However, when they do assemble, being appropriate for form itself makes them into something that can be damaged, so they are included within form. Well then, if these atoms of substance are form, then are they not the object of eye consciousness and so forth, you say? In general, they are not, be­cause as explained in the autocommentary:A single atom of the faculties or atom of an object does not produce a consciousness.Therefore, if you include these atoms of substance in an aggregate, it has to be form. However, when they are considered a sense base, they are not in­cluded in the sense base of form, because they do not actually produce an eye consciousness that perceives them. This means the same as the passage in the Compendium ofAbhidharma35 that talks of “those of the five forms of the sense base of dharmas,” so it is included in the forms of the sense base of dharmas. Therefore, not all the forms included in the sense base of dharmas are imper­ceptible, and the eleven classifications of form are not all included in the ag­gregate of form.Well then, are they permanent or impermanent, you say? Some say that these are what is meant in the explanation of noncomposite empty particles from the Kalachakra, so they are permanent. O f course you might say so, but that is nothing more than talk that does not go anywhere. If that were so, our own position becomes the same as the assertion by the extremist36 Particularists109"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA Iand others. Their assertion that atoms are permanent is a position that the Master37 shreds. From the Prince:The Particularists propose many things such as non­composite atoms and so forth, and this is to refute their scriptural tradition.Because it has been established that there are only three noncomposites and because permanent composite particles have been refuted, you should be more careful. Therefore, in this Great Exposition presentation, atoms are proposed to be impermanent only. Otherwise, it would be logical to describe them as noncomposite substance, and they are not described as such.In the second case of atoms as sense base, when they are combined, atoms become something showable that can obscure and obstruct made out of the particles of the eight substances. This can be demonstrated through the ex­ample of a vase.38 As will be explained:In Desire, atoms without soundO r faculties: eight substances.39ii. The explanation.

The shapes of each of the faculties from the eye faculty to the body faculty are in succession flax, a knot of birch, a copper needle, a half-moon, and fur that is soft to the touch. The male and female faculties are like a thumb and the inside of a drum, respectively.(2) Explaining the five objects.

Distracted, and mind-free as well,Virtue or non, continuous,And caused by the great sources: this Is called the imperceptible.The imperceptible form of a vow or so forth41 follows the being who possesses it (i.e., the person who took the vow) even when he is distracted from the m ind state that motivated him when he attained the vow. It also follows the stream of a being who is in one of the two mind-free absorptions. It follows the continuum of someone whose mind is not distracted as well. Impercepti­ble form is definitely only virtue or nonvirtue, because neutral minds are weak and so cannot motivate one to attain an imperceptible form. This excludes the eyes, ears, and so forth, which are neutral.Continuous means that the imperceptible form remains in one’s continuum until that which forfeits it arises. Therefore, it is continuously present in times of distraction and so forth. This distinguishes it from mere perceptible forms or perceptible speech. The continuum of the attainment42 of a vow is also pres­ent both when the m ind is present and not, is either virtuous or nonvirtuous, and is connected to a being’s stream of being, but it is not an imperceptible form. Imperceptible form is distinguished from the mere attainment of a vow because it is caused by the great sources, the elements of earth and so forth.Imperceptible form is by nature form and action, but whereas others can distinguish an individual’s motivation when they perceive perceptible forms112"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"THE AGGREGATES, ELEMENTS, AND SENSE BASESsuch as body and speech, others cannot discern an individuals motivation from imperceptible forms. This is what is called the imperceptible, to teach the Masters opinion.The Master Sañghabhadra says there are some faults in this presentation:It is incomplete and contradicts the treatise.It undermines, implies what is not must be,And states an extra “as well.” It fails To distinguish where it should distinguish.These six faults and their refutation are thoroughly explained in the Kartik, so refer there.(b) Its cause, the four sources. This has four points.(i) The sources' classifications12ab The sources are the elementsO f earth and water, fire and air.W hen it says above, “And caused by the great sources,” what are these sources? you ask. T he sources43 are the elements o f earth and water, fire and air. From beginningless time they have never been known not to arise and they are the source that makes the form of the result arise, so they are called sources. They are the greatest of the causes of the resulting forms and form the greater part of their functions, so they are great. As they hold their own characteristics and the form of the result, they are called dhatu44 or elements.(ii) Their functions12 c Their functions are to hold, et cetera.The function of earth is to hold from falling down, et cetera: water has the function of cohering w ithout spreading; fire, ripening w ithout rotting or de­caying; and air the function of making things increase further and further.(iii) Their characteristics12 d They are hard, wet, and hot, and moving.Earth is hard and solid. Water is wet and liquid. Fire is hot and burning, or113"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA Iheat. Air is moving a continuum from one place to another. Respectively, these are the characteristics of each of these elements.(iv) Dispelling doubts13. According to the worlds conventions,Color and form are considered earth,Water, and fire. The atmosphereIs the element itself, and like those, too.Well then, what is the distinction between earth and the element of earth? you ask. The elements of earth and so forth must fulfill the above character­istics, but earth and so forth do not, because according to the world s con­ventions, color and form are considered earth. For example, it is like saying earth is a yellow square. In the same way water and fire are too: water is said to be a white circle and fire a red triangle. T he atmosphere is also in common parlance the element of wind itself.Alternatively, earth and the others are like those, so their color and shape are called thus, too. It is said that the mandala of wind is a blue arc, but this last is said to be inconsistent with the Treatise.45in. How the form aggregate is presented as elements and sense basesI4ab Only these faculties and objectsAre called ten bases and elements.The Master is skilled in concise and simple words and composed a text with few difficult words. He teaches that this very aggregate of form itself is ele­ments and sense bases. By saying the identifying words, “O nly these five fac­ulties and five objects,” he teaches that imperceptible forms are not included. W hen designating the five faculties and five objects as sense bases, they are called the ten sense bases that have form, and when designating them as ele­ments, as the ten elements that have form.b. The aggregates, sense bases, and elements of feeling, conception, and formation. This has four points.i. Feeling14c Feelings experience.The essence of the aggregate of feeling is to clearly experience in dependence114"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE AGGREGATES, ELEMENTS, AND SENSE BASESby the manner of engaging help or harm. To classify feeling, there are the six from feeling that arises from contact assembled by eye up to feeling that arises from contact assembled by mind. Alternatively, there are also pleasant, suffer­ing, neutral, mentally pleasant, and mental unhappiness.ii. Conceptionl4cd ConceptionIs the perception of attributes.The essence of the aggregate of conception is when one focuses on one of the six objects, to say, “These aspects are blue, and these are yellow,” discern­ing the individual fine distinctions. Thus in essence, it is the perception of attributes. To classify, there are the six of conception that arises from contact assembled by eye and so forth.iii. Formation15a Formation differs from four skandhas.The essence of the aggregate of formation is composites that differ from the four skandhas or aggregates: the previous three and consciousness that will be explained. Here, nonconcurrent formations46 are proposed to be substantial. By saying “composites,” noncomposites are excluded.If you classify formations concisely, there are two types: mental factors and nonconcurrent formations. If you classify them extensively, there are 73 mental factors and 14 actual nonconcurrent formations and their compatibles. The Teaching the Ten Area.i47 also presents seven hundred classifications.iv. Teaching these as the sense base and element of dharmas15b-d These three and imperceptibles And noncomposites are called theSense base and element of dharmas.These three— feeling, conception, and formation— and imperceptible forms and the three noncom posites, when presented as sense bases, are called the sense base of dharmas, and when presented as elements, the element of dharmas.c. The aggregate, elements, and sense base of consciousness. This has four115"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA Itopics: i. The essence of consciousness, ii. Presenting it as a sense base, iii. Pre­senting it as elements, and iv. A specific explanation of the element of mind.i. The essence of consciousness16a Consciousness is distinctly knowing.The essence of aggregate of consciousness is distinctly, or by its own power, knowing the focus, object, and aspects, the bare meaning. By saying “its own power,” mental factors are excluded, because they do not know by their own power, and by saying “knowing,” the other three bases of the knowable48 are excluded, because they are not cognition. Several methods of classifying con­sciousness are proposed, such the Great Vehicle’s and so forth, but in this tra­dition only the six from the eye formation to the m ind consciousness are proposed.ii. Presenting consciousness as a sense base16b The sense base of m ind is also that,W hen presenting it as a sense base, the sense base of m ind is also that, these six very collections of consciousness.iii. Presenting consciousness as elements16cd And also seven elements—Six consciousnesses and the mind.Consciousness itself is not just presented as the sense base of mind, it is also seven elements, because it is proposed as the six consciousnesses from the eye consciousness to the m ind consciousness and the element of mind.iv. The specific explanation of the element of mind. This has two points.(1) Identifying the character base17ab Six consciousnesses that have just Immediately past are mind.W hat is this m ind element that is different from the six collections of con­sciousness? you ask. O f course, there really is not any such thing. However, the six collections of consciousness that have just immediately past, without1 1 6"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE AGGREGATES, ELEMENTS, AND SENSE BASESany other cognition occurring in between, provide the support for the next m ind consciousness, so they axe called the sense base of m ind or the element of m ind. Saying “six” indicates that it is in ail six consciousness. Saying “past” makes the distinction with present consciousness: the present is taught as con­sciousness and the past as the faculty of m ind or the element of mind. Saying “immediately past” indicates that it is the m ind that has recently passed.The explanation here of the mind element as immediately past is in relation just to the m ind consciousness that it supports. It is not pervasively in the ac­tual past, because it is said in the autocommentary that each of the eighteen elements has three times.49 From the autocommentary:If that were not so, the element of m ind would be past only and would not be either future or present, but all eighteen elements are also proposed to have three times.(2) The proof17cd To establish the support of the sixth,We posit eighteen elements.Well then, the six elements of consciousness and the element of m ind can each be included within the other, so in substance there are only seventeen or twelve, you say. In substance, it is so. However, in terms of characteristics, they are not the same. Just as the five sense consciousnesses each have a dom inant condition as support,50 the m ind consciousness also needs a supporting dom ­inant condition. The sixth m ind consciousness has no other support, so in order to fully establish the supporting dom inant condition o f the sixth consciousness, the six consciousnesses are divided into past and present parts, and the past part is presented as the so-called m ind element. Thus we posit eighteen elements: the six faculties as support, the six consciousnesses that are supported, and the focus of six objects.2. Teaching them in consolidation. This has two points.a. The actual consolidation18ab One aggregate, one sense base, and One element include them all.Is there also a consolidated presentation of the aggregates, elements, and sense bases? you wonder. There is. The one aggregate of form includes the ten senseii 7"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA Ibases that have form, the ten elements that have form, and imperceptible form. The one sense base of m ind includes the aggregate of consciousness and the seven elements of cognition. The one element of dharma includes the aggre­gates of feeling, conception, and formation and the sense base of dharma. It also includes imperceptible form. Thus three categories include them, all dhar- mas.b. The manner of consolidation18cd Its by their nature— they do not Possess another’s entity.Is this consolidation a characteristic consolidation where what is included is the same as what includes, like made and impermanent, or is it a nominal consolidation like the four means of magnetizing51 or the fourfold assembly,52 where what is included is different from what includes?It is not a nominal, but a characteristic consolidation where what is included is the same as what includes, because it is by their own nature that what is in­cluded is contained within that which includes. This is because that which is included possesses the specific characteristics of that which includes. They do not possess the characteristics of other dharmas’ entities. Being included by something different is only an occasional or temporary inclusion, so that is only nominally an inclusion.533. Dispelling doubts19. O f course there are two eyes, et cetera,But since their type, sphere, consciousness Are similar, they’re just one element.To beautify, they come in pairs.Well then, there are two eyes, two ears, and two nostrils, so should there not be twenty-one elements? you ask. O f course there are two eyes, et cetera, but since their type, being merely eyes and so forth, and sphere, or the type of object they perceive such as form and so forth, are similar; and because they produce and support the same type of eye consciousness and so forth, they are similar, so therefore they are proven to be just one element. The phrase “et cetera” means that the ears and nose should be known to be the same.Well then, it is therefore unnecessary for two to arise, you say. Here in order to beautify the body support, they come in pairs. Well then, why is it that owls and so forth have two eyes but are not beautiful? you say. This is because118"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE AGGREGATES, ELEMENTS, AND SENSE BASESthey are by nature not beautiful; it is not that having two eyes makes them not beautiful. If they only had one eye, they would be even uglier, so for that reason two only is beautiful.B. The reason they are given the names aggregate, sense base, and element20 a-c The meaning of aggregate is heaped,Sense base means the gate for arising,And element means family.From a sutra:Any form at all, whether past or future or present, in­ternal or external, coarse or subtle, base or sublime, that is far away or near, these are all included in one: they are counted within the form aggregate...The sutra continues in the same way up to the aggregate of consciousness. As is said, the m eaning of the term aggregate is many things of the same type such as form and so forth heaped together; sense base means the gate for the arising and expansion of mind and mental factors; and element means the origin of later things of the same family.54Well then, noncomposites would therefore not be an element because they are permanent and produce no future noncomposites, you say. Noncomposites have no similar class, but because they are the source for m ind and mental factors by way of being their focus, they are designated as an element.C. The reason for teaching three dharmas. This has three points.1. Actual20d-f Delusions, faculties, and interests Are threefold, so the three are taught:The aggregates, et cetera.W hy did the Lord Buddha teach the three dharmas of aggregates, sense bases, and elements? you ask. The delusions of holding mental factors, form, and both form and mind to be a whole self, and the distinctions of the three sharp, middle, and dull faculties, and the three types of interest that seek concise, medium, and extensive explanations are all threefold, so the three are taught: the aggregates, et cetera, including sense bases and elements.119"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY i* AREA I2. The reason for teaching feeling and conception as separate aggregates2 1 . Because they are the root of quarrels,And cause samsara and the order Feeling and conception are taught As different aggregates than factors.W hy are both feeling and conception presented as separate aggregates from the other mental factors? you ask. Because they are the root o f the quarrels among both householders and monastics, they are presented separately. Ffouse- holders dispute water, fields, and so forth, and the root of these disputes is feelings: they want pleasure for themselves and suffering for others, so they quarrel. Monastics conceive of their own and others’ views as good or bad and then prove and refute them. Because the root of these disputes is erroneous conceptions, the aggregate of conception is presented separately.Alternatively, as they are the principal cause of samsara, they are presented separately. By clinging to feelings, out of mistaken conceptions one views ego­lessness as the self, and the four erroneous conceptions55 become the support for many afflictions, so the wheel of samsara turns. This means that these aggregates are the root of all faults and problems, and therefore should be abandoned.Alternatively, they are the cause of the order in which the five aggregates are taught, which will be explained below.56 Feeling and conception are taught as different aggregates than the mental factors.3. The reason for not teaching noncomposites as an aggregate22ab Since noncomposites do not suitAggregate’s meaning, they are not taught.W hy are noncomposites presented as elements and sense bases but not as ag­gregates? you ask. There is a reason that noncomposites are not presented as an aggregate: since noncomposites cannot be destroyed, demolished, or so forth, they do not suit aggregate’s meaning. A separate so-called “aggregate of noncomposites” is inappropriate: because they are not many things aggre­gated, they are not taught as aggregates.This fault does not apply to presenting atomic substances as aggregates. From the autocommentary:In that case, if the meaning of aggregating were the m eaning o f aggregate, the aggregates w ould have nominal existence,57 because they are many substances120"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THE AGGREGATES, ELEMENTS, AND SENSE BASESgathered together, like aggregating or an individual, you say. It is not so, because even a single atom of sub­stance is an aggregate. In that way, as a single unit has no aggregating itself, do not say that the meaning of aggregating is the meaning of aggregate.As this explains, the aggregates are not pervasively many things aggregated, but the aggregates are appropriate to be many things aggregated.D. The orders of the three dharmas. This has three points.1. The order of the five aggregates22 cd The order is by coarse, all-afflicted,The pot and so forth, the realms’ meanings.T he order of the five aggregates is presented by the order of coarseness, the order in which the all-afflicted arise, the order of the pot and so forth, and the order of the three realms’ meanings.Because form is obstructive, it is the coarsest of all, so it is taught first. Next, feeling is coarse because it is variable. Next, conception is also coarser than the final two: it delineates attributes and so is easy to know. Next, formation is by nature to clearly formulate, “I must make myself happy; I must not make myself unhappy.” As consciousness is merely focusing, it is the subtlest of all. This teaches the order from coarse to subtle.Also the order can be taught through the order in which all-afflicted dhar­mas such as greed and so forth arise. First, males and females have lust for each others’ bodily forms, and that creates desire for pleasant feelings. From that come mistaken conceptions, and from those, formation comes under the power of the all-afflicted. T hat makes consciousness afflicted as well.Alternatively, they are comparable to the pot and so forth— food, flavorings, cook, and eater. Form is comparable to a pot, feelings to food, conceptions to flavorings, formation to the cook, and consciousness is comparable to the eater.Alternatively, it is also taught by comparing it to the order of the Desire, Form, and Formless realms, and the Peak of Existence,58 or the three realms. Desire is differentiated by form, the Form realm by feeling, the first three Formless realms by conception, and the Peak of Existence by formation. Con­sciousness is present in all, so it is taught last. This is like the order of a field, seeds, shoots, and so forth.121"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA I2. The order of the six faculties23. The object is present, so first five.The object is source-derived, so four.Since at great distance or since quickly,O r else in order of location.They are easy to realize as the object they perceive is in the present— the ob­jects of form and so forth— so first the five that have form— the eye and so forth— are taught. M ind is the subject that perceives objects of the three times and noncomposites that are not included in the times, so it is difficult to re­alize, like for example realizing that all dharmas are egoless. For that reason, it is taught last.Among the five, the four from eye up to tongue are subjects that perceive only the object, forms of source-derived that are results of the four sources,59 so those four are taught first. Body is not necessarily like that because it is a subject that perceives both the sources and the source-derived.Among these four, there is a reason that eye and ear are explained first, be­fore the nose and tongue. Since the eye and ear perceive form and sound with­out contacting the object, they can engage an object at a great distance. O f these two, eye can engage an object at a much greater distance, so it is m en­tioned first. For instance, you can see a river from far off but not hear its sound. The nose and tongue both engage what is near, but since the nose engages the object more quickly than the tongue, it is explained first. It is like when the tongue does not yet taste the food, but the nose smells its aroma.O r else the faculties are taught in the order of the height of their location or position. M ind is supported by them and does not stay in a location, so it is taught last.Establishing the order o f the six faculties also establishes the order of the objects and the consciousnesses. For example, it is just as when the ranks of six kings are established, the ranks of the queens and princes are also established.3. An aside to dispel a doubt24. One is specific and the main,And one has many dharmas, the highest,So one is called sense base of form,And one is called sense base of dharma.If the first ten sense bases are all form, why is only the object of eye the sense122"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"HOW EVERYTHING IS INCLUDED IN THREE DHARMASbase of form? And if all twelve sense bases are dharmas by nature, why is only the object of mental cognition the sense base of dharma? you ask.The reason for the first is the one object of eye has no other name, so it is designated by applying the general name “form” to the specific sense base. One says, “This is it,” to indicate something, and in common usage that is known as form. And others say that the sense base of form is the main or prin­cipal form for three reasons: i) because form is coarse as it has twenty types; 2) because it is the sphere of the fleshly eye, the divine eye, and the eye of no­bles’ full knowing; and 3) because it is obstructive and showable.The reason for the second is that the one object of m ind has or includes m any dharmas— the three middle aggregates, imperceptibles, and noncom ­posites— and that the sense base of dharma includes the highest of dharmas, the analytical cessation of nirvana. So in order, the one object of eye alone is called the sense base of form, and the one object of m ind alone is called the sense base of dharma.III. Teaching how everything is included in three dharmas. This has three topics: A. How the aggregates of Dharma are included, B. Including other dharmas in the aggregates, elements, and sense bases, and C. Additionally teaching the essence of two elements.A. How the aggregates of Dharma are included. This has two topics: 1. Ac­tual, and 2 . The size of the aggregates of the Dharma.1. Actual,25. The eighty thousand aggregatesO f Dharma the Sage taught are all Words or are names, and thus they are Included in form or in formation.In the sutras where it says, “The eighty thousand aggregates of Dharma,” how are these included within the five aggregates? you ask. The eighty thousand aggregates o f Dharm a that the Sage, the Buddha, taught are all, according to the Sutra school, words or sound, or according to the Great Exposition, they are names that are the object of mind by nature. Thus they are included in the aggregate of form or in the aggregate of form ation respectively, it is proposed.123"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA I2. The size of the aggregates of the Dharma. This has two points.a. Refuting other positions26ab Some say their length equals the treatise,O r depends on aggregates, et cetera.W hat is the size of each of the aggregates of Dharma? you ask. Some schools say that their length equals the length of treatise composed by Shariputra, which has six thousand stanzas. Other schools propose that the size of each aggregate of Dharma depends on how long it takes to teach the aggregates, faculties, sense bases, et cetera completely, but there is not a fixed number of verses.b. Presenting the Master's own position26cd But aggregates of Dharma taughtCorrespond to antidotes for conduct.But in the Master’s own position, the size of the aggregates of Dharm a taught, such as meditation on repulsiveness and so forth, correspond to the number of afflictions. They are taught as antidotes for sentient beings’ conduct moti­vated by the three poisons and the eighty thousand afflictions of pride and so forth. The word “but” is explained as indicating that this is the Master’s own position: there are twenty-one thousand as antidotes for each of the three poi­sons and twenty-one thousand as antidotes for conducted motivated by the three poisons mixed in equal parts for a total of eighty-four thousand. This is explained in the Retention o f the Jewel TalaGo and other texts, it is said.B. Including other dharmas in the aggregates, elements, and sense bases27. Likewise the other aggregates,Sense bases or else elements:Examine their own characters;Include them in what has been explained.Just as the eighty thousand aggregates of Dharma are included in the five ag­gregates, likewise the various other dharmas named aggregates, sense bases, or else elements should be thoroughly examined on the basis of their own characteristics. Then include them in what has been explained, the five ag­gregates, eighteen elements, and twelve sense bases.The five undefiled aggregates taught61 are included in the five aggregates124"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"HOW EVERYTHING IS INCLUDED IN THREE DHARMAStaught here as follows: the aggregate of discipline is included in form, and the last four are included in formation.Among the ten all-encompassing sense bases,62 the eight sense bases of earth, water, fire, air, blue, yellow, white, and red are also collected in nongreed, so they are included in the sense base of dharma. Including all that is associated with them, they are the five aggregates, and they are included in the sense bases of m ind and dharma. The eight overpowering sense bases63 are, as the above, included in the sense bases of m ind and dharma. All-encompassing sky and consciousness, and the four sense bases of the Formless64 have four aggre­gates, so they are included in the sense bases of m ind and dharma.Also in the sutras there are said to be the six elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. The first four are touch, the fifth is form, and the sixth is included in the seven elements of mind.In brief, within the eighteen elements there are three groups o f six, one group of four, six groups of three, and two groups of two: they are grouped in forty-four. The Great Tikd65 explains this expanded manner o f grouping them, so refer there.C. Additionally teaching the essence of two elem ents. This has two points.1. The elem ent of space28ab Openings are the elementO f space— they’re light and dark, it’s claimed.The characteristics o f earth and the other three have been explained, and the characteristics of space and consciousness have also been explained. But the characteristics of the elements of the latter two have not been explained. Are thus space and consciousness themselves those two elements? you ask.They are not. They say that the openings in doorframes, smoke holes, mouths, and noses are the element o f space. The Great Exposition school posits that this is because in the daytime they are mostly light and at nighttime they are mostly dark. “It is claimed” is a skeptical word from the Sutra school. The Sutra school posits that space itself is the element of space.2. Consciousness28cd The element of consciousnessIs defiled consciousness, arising’s basis.125"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IT he element o f consciousness is defiled consciousness because those six ele­ments themselves provide the basis of arising from rebirth-linking (the m o­m ent of conception) to death and because undefiled consciousness is unsuitable for that.Therefore earth and the other three are included in the element of touch. The element of space is included in the aggregate of form. The element of consciousness is included in the seven elements of consciousness.IV. The complete classification of the aspects of elements. This has seven topics: A. Classifying in two categories, B. Classifying in three categories,C. Differentiating them by what they possess, D. Classification of those with form, E. Three modes of production, E Distinctions o f attainm ent, and G. Classifying as external, internal, and so forth.A. Classifying in two categories. This has two points.1. Showable and unshowable29a The showable here is form alone.Well then, among these eighteen elements, how many can be shown and how many cannot? you ask. The showable here in this discussion of the eighteen elements is the element of form alone, because phrases such as “It is here” or “Someone has it” indicate it to another. The remaining seventeen are not showable.2. Obstructive and unobstructive29b The obstructive is the ten with form.How many of the eighteen elements are obstructive, and how many are un­obstructive? you ask. The obstructive are those that block: only the ten with form are appropriate for form and are obscuring and obstructive.There are three types of obstructiveness: resistance, contact of object, and contact of focus. In the first, when there is one obstructive thing in a particular location, that thing blocks the arising of another obstructive thing in that same location. For example, if there is a hand somewhere, another hand cannot arise there, or where there already is a stone, another stone cannot arise.Contact of object is when the subject, the eye and so forth, contacts its ob­ject of form and so forth. The Treatise on Designation gives four possibilities of12 6"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASPECTS OF ELEMENTSeyes that contact their object when in the water but not when out, and four possibilities of those that contact their object at night but not day.Contact of focus is when the concurrent dharmas66 contact their focus.B. Classifying in three categories. This has two points.1. Categories of virtue and so forth29cd Eight neutral are just those exceptFor form and sound. The others are threefold.Well then, of the eighteen elements, how many are virtuous, nonvirtuous, and neutral? you ask. O f the eighteen elements eight are solely neutral. They are just those that have been explained as obstructive except for form and sound. They are neutral by their very nature. T he ten that are other than those eight are threefold— virtuous, nonvirtuous, and neutral. Form and sound can be­come virtuous or nonvirtuous by the power of virtuous or nonvirtuous moti­vation. The eight unobstructive elements— the seven of consciousness and the element of dharma— can be virtue, nonvirtue, or neutral.2. Categories of the three realms30. They all are in the Desire realm.The Form realm has fourteen: except The elements of scent and taste,And the nose and tongue consciousnesses.3 lab The Formless realm has elementsO f mind, dharma, m ind consciousness.Well then, how many of the eighteen elements are in the realms of Desire, Form, and Formless? you ask. They, the eighteen, are all in the Desire realm, because in the Desire realm one is not detached from their nature and craves them, making them one’s own.The Form realm has fourteen. W hich ones? you ask. All those except the element o f scent, and the element of taste, and the element of the nose con­sciousness and the element of tongue consciousness. In the Form realm, there is no scent or taste because scent and taste are food and only those who are free of desire for food are born there. Therefore, there are neither nose nor tongue consciousness because their objects, scent and taste, do not exist.Well then, there should not be an element of touch because there is no food,127"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA Iyou say. There is no touch that is food, but the element of touch is presented because those in the Form realm wear clothes and so forth. Well then, there should not be faculties of nose or tongue either, you say. These two are pre­sented because they beautify the bodily support.T he Formless realm has the three elements o f m ind, dharma, and m ind consciousness. The remaining are not there, because one is free from craving for form, so the ten that have form do not exist there, and therefore the first five consciousnesses that arise from them do not exist either.C. Differentiating them by what they possess. This has three points.1. Whether or not they have defilements3 led Those three are defiled or undefiled.And those remaining are defiled.Well then, of these eighteen elements, how many are defiled and how are many undefiled? you ask. Those last three elements of mind, dharma, and m ind consciousness have both defiled or undefiled aspects. The defiled aspect is that which is included in the first two truths. The undefiled aspect is that which is included in the truth of path and noncomposites. Those fifteen remaining are solely defiled. The ten with form are the truth of suffering, and the cog­nitions of the five sense gates look outward, so they are not on the level of equipoise and are thus discards of meditation. Also, “defilements can / Develop in relation to them.”672. Whether or not they have consideration and examination32. Those which consider and examine:Five elements of consciousness.The final three are of three types.Those which remain are free of both.33. The nonconceptual have no thoughtsThat recognize or that remember.These two distract the m ind s full knowing O r are all memory in mind.Well then, of the eighteen elements, how many have both consideration and examination? Flow many have examination but not consideration? How many have neither consideration nor examination? you ask.128"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASPECTS OF ELEMENTSO f the eighteen elements, those which consider and examine are the first five elements o f consciousness, because they are coarse as they look outward and because they are on levels that are connected with consideration and ex­amination.T he final three elements of m ind and so forth are o f three types: they can have both consideration and examination, or no consideration and just ex­amination, or neither consideration nor examination. T he first type is the mental factors of the last three elements that are included in Desire and the mere first dhyanas actual practice except for consideration and examination themselves, because they are on levels that are not detached from consideration and examination. The second type is the mental factors of the last three ele­ments that are in the special dhyana except for examination, because these have abandoned consideration and are on a level that is concurrent only with examination. The third type is the nonconcurrent of those three elements in Desire and the first dhyana, and the last three elements of the second dhyana and higher. In the second dhyana and higher, they may be concurrent, but they are on levels where consideration and examination have been abandoned.Examination in Desire and the actual practice of the first dhyana does not fall within any of these three categories because it is concurrent with consid­eration but not with examination. That is because examination has no second examination.Those elements which remain, the ten with form, are free of both consid­eration and examination, because they are not concurrent.Well then, if the five collections of consciousness have consideration and examination, that contradicts the sutras’ explanation of them as nonconcep- tual, you say. According to the Great Exposition school, there are three types of thoughts: essential thoughts, thoughts that recognize, and thoughts that re­member.68 The eye consciousness and other four do have essential thoughts, but they are nonconceptual because they have no thoughts that recognize or thoughts that remember. For example, it is like saying a horse with only one foot is a horse with no feet. Essential thoughts will be explained below. These two, thoughts that recognize and thoughts that remember, by their nature re­spectively i) distract the m in d s full knowing when the m ind is not in equipoise, and 2) are all m em ory in association with mind, whether the m ind is in equipoise or not.3. Whether or not they have a focus34ab The seven elements of mindAnd half o f dharma, too, have focus.129"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IWell then, how many of these eighteen elements have a focus, and how many do not? you ask. O f these eighteen elements, the seven elements o f m ind al­ways have focus. And not only those but the mental factors that are half of dharma, too, have a focus. The remaining ten elements with form and the portion of the element of dharma that is nonconcurrent have no focus.D. Classification of those with form. This has five points.1. Classification of appropriated and nonappropriated34cd The nine are not appropriated:Those eight and sound. Nine others: twofold.Well then, of these eighteen elements, how many are appropriated and how many are not? you ask. The meaning of appropriated is that which is suitable to be the support for the arising of pleasure or pain when helped or harmed by contact with something with form. The opposite is nonappropriated. In this context, of the eighteen elements, nine are solely not appropriated. They are those eight explained as having focus, with the second half of the element of dharma also added to make the whole element of dharma. These eight are not in the collection of faculties, so they cannot be either helped or harmed. And sound can be connected with the one’s stream of being, but it is not in the collection of faculties, so it cannot be helped or harmed. Therefore it is not appropriated either.The five of eye and so forth and the four of form and so forth— the nine other elements are different from those that are not appropriated. They are twofold because they can be either appropriated or nonappropriated. The five faculties of the present are appropriated. Form, scent, taste, and touch that are of the present and not separate from the faculties are appropriated. Those external elements that are separate from the faculties and not included in the stream of one’s being— including hair, body hair, teeth, and nails with the ex­ception of their roots— are not appropriated. All that is past or future is solely not appropriated.2. Classification of source and source-derived35a-c Touch has two types. The other nine W ith form and part of the element O f dharmas, too, are source-derived.Well then, of the eighteen elements, how many are sources? How many are130"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASPECTS OF ELEMENTSsource-derived? you ask. The element of touch has two types of source and source-derived. Earth, water, fire, and air are the sources. Soft, rough, heavy, light, cold, hunger, and thirst are source-derived. T he other nine w ith form— the eye and so forth— are source-derived, and likewise part of the element of dharmas, too— imperceptible form— is solely source-derived. These are source-derived because they are derived from the cause of the four sources, which act to produce them. The remaining that do not have form are proven to be neither sources nor source-derived.3. Classification of conglomerated and nonconglomerated35 d The ten with form, conglomerates.Well then, how many of the elements are accumulated, and how many are not? you ask. O f the eighteen elements, the ten elements w ith form are con­glomerates, because they are solely collections or conglomerations of atoms. The definite article “the” is for emphasis: the elements that are unobstructive are proven not to be conglomerated.4. Classification of cutter and that which is cut36ab The cutter and that which is cut Are four external elements,How many of the elements can cut and how many can be cut? you ask. O f the eighteen elements, the cutter, such as an axe, and that which is cut, such as wood and so forth, are the four external elements of form, smell, taste, and touch. Thus it is determined that these four elements can be both cutter and cut; the others are proven to be neither.5. Classifications of burning and weighing36cd As are the burnt and that which weighs.The burner and weighed are disputed.Well, how many of the elements can be burned? How many are measurers? you ask. Just as the cutter and cut are the four elements, the wood and so forth which is burnt and that which weighs, scales and so forth, are also the four external elements. The faculties are neither because they are lucid, like light rays. Because it has no continuum, sound is also not that which is burnt, that which burns, that which is weighed, nor that which weighs. T he burner and that which is weighed are disputed by earlier masters. Some say the four131"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA Iexternal elements only are that which burns and that which is weighed. Some say that which burns is the element of fire alone, and that which is weighed is heaviness alone.E. Three modes of production. This has two points.1. General37. The five internal are producedBy ripening and development.Sound is not ripened. The compatibleAnd ripening produce eight unobstructive.38a Others are threefold.Well, how many are produced by full ripening, development, and compatible cause? you ask. O f the eighteen elements, only the five internal faculties of the eye and so forth are produced by full ripening and produced by develop­ment. They can be produced by full ripening because the faculties of the lower realms are produced by the full ripening of nonvirtue and those of the higher realms are produced by the full ripening of virtue. They can also be produced by development through the four causes of food, sleep, fine conduct, and samadhi.Sound can be either produced by development or produced by compatible cause but is not produced by full ripening, because it is the manifestation of one’s desires. Well then, it says in the Treatise on Designation:69Now listen well to how a Tathagata Attains his qualities of voice and speech:Fully abandoning harsh words and chatter Will bring the marks of a Tathagata.Is this not contradictory, you say? It is not contradictory. The meaning of this passage is that abandoning harsh words and chatter produces the fully ripened result of a fine throat. The throat produces the melody of Brahma,70 but that melody is not itself a fully ripened result.Those elements that the compatible cause and full ripening produce are the eight unobstructive elements. O f those eight, those that are produced by a cause o f same status or universal cause are produced by compatible cause. Those that have are produced by a cause of full ripening are produced132"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASPECTS OF ELEMENTSby full ripening.71 They cannot be produced by development. By essence they are not aggregations of particles and they are unobstructive, so they cannot be developed.T he others, the four that remain— form, scent, taste, and touch— are three­fold: they have all three modes of production.2. Particulars38ab One has substance.The last three are a moment.O f the eighteen elements, noncomposite dharma alone has permanent, stable substance.T he last of the eighteen elements, the three undefiled elements of mind, dharma, and m ind consciousness when assembled on the first m om ent of for­bearance of knowing dharmas of suffering72 are a m om ent that is not produced by compatible cause, because prior to that there is no undefiled path compat­ible with them.This teaches particular points of the lines, “The compatible / And ripening produce eight unobstructive.” The m ind and so forth of the first undefiled m oment and the noncomposite portion of the element of dharma are not pro­duced by any of these three modes of production.The m ind concurrent with dharma forbearance of suffering is the element of m ind and the element of m ind consciousness. This presents it from the point of view of its function. All that is concurrent with this; its attainment; its arising, abiding, and perishing; and the undefiled vows attained at that mo­m ent are the element of dharma.F. Distinctions of attainment3 8 b -d The eyeAnd element of consciousness:Gained singly or together, too.Does someone who newly attains the eye element also newly attain the eye consciousness? you ask. To distinguish how the eye and the element of con­sciousness can be gained singly, there are four alternatives. The four are i) newly attaining the eye but not newly attaining the eye consciousness, 2) newly attaining the latter but not the former, 3) or attaining both together or simul­taneously, and 4) not newly attaining either. The first is like dying in the Form­less realm and taking birth in any one of the second, third, or fourth dhyanas.133"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA IThe second is like taking rebirth in Desire from the second dhyana. The third is like taking birth in Desire from the Formless. The fourth is taking birth in the Formless from the Formless. The word “too” additionally includes these following:The ear And element of consciousness:Gained singly or together, too.The others are similar.G. Classifying as external, internal, and so forth. This has seven topics: 1. In­ternal and external, 2 . Active and inactive, 3. Discard of seeing and so forth,4. W hether or not it is view, 5. W hich element is the object of which con­sciousness, 6 . Permanent/impermanent, and 7. W hether or not they are fac­ulties.1. Internal and external39 ab Twelve are internal, except form And so forth.Well then, of the eighteen elements, how many internal and external elements are there? you ask. O f the eighteen elements, twelve are internal: all except the external elements of form and so forth.2. Active and inactive. This has two points,a. Actual39bc Dharma must be active.The remaining are inactive, too—O f these, how many are active and how many are inactive? you ask. O f the eighteen elements, the element of dharm a m ust be solely active, because the object of the action of the m ind consciousness of either nobles or ordinary in­dividuals is definitely pervasively active.73 This tradition, which does not assert a self-aware cognition, proposes that this is because the cognition that thinks, “All dharmas are egoless,” has everything as its object except for itself and the assembly of mental factors that is coemergent with it. If one posits self-aware­ness, then the cognition itself also becomes its own object, but not positing that is a tenet of the Great Exposition school.134"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASPECTS OF ELEMENTST he remaining seventeen elements are inactive. The word “too” indicates that they can also be active.b. The meaning of inactive39 d That which does not perform its function.W hat is the distinction between active and inactive? you ask. Any element which does not perform its own function is inactive, and the opposite of that is active. The eye is active when it looked, looks, or will look at form. It is the same for the other faculties up to the body. The eye is said to be inactive in four instances: when it does not see form and has ceased, is ceasing, will cease, or is a nonarising dharma base. So say the Kashmiris, but the Westerners say that some nonarising dharma bases possess consciousness and some do not, so there should be five. The five external elements of form and so forth are also the same. The seven mind-elements can be either active or inactive.The six elements from the eye up to the m ind are specific to one individ­ual— it is impossible that two individuals could look with the same eye and so forth. Therefore, whichever of those is active or inactive for one individual is active or inactive for all. The five elements from form to touch are common to multiple individuals. Furthermore, it is possible that one individual might watch a dance, for example, whereas another individual might not watch that dance. Therefore these five elements are active in relation to those who are watching or so forth, and inactive in relation to those who are not watching or so forth. Therefore, since the eye and so forth are specific to one being, they are presented as either active or inactive in relation to one being. Since form and the other four are common to many individuals, they are presented in relation to many beings.The action of the six internal elements is to provide the subject of the object and the support for consciousness. The action of the six elements that are ob­jects is to be the object of the faculties and the focused object of the conscious­nesses. The action of the six elements of consciousness is to be supported by the faculties and to provide the subject for the objects. Therefore when these perform these functions, they are active, and when they do not, they are inac­tive. W hen these are nonarising dharma bases, they are inactive, and when they have arisen or will arise, they are active.In the abhidharma tradition of the Great Vehicle, only the five faculties are divided into active and inactive; the others are not.3. Discard of seeing and so forth. This has two points.135"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA Ia. Actual40ab Ten are discards of meditation.Five also. The last three, three types.Well then, how many of these are discarded by seeing? How many by medi­tation? How many are not discarded? you ask. The ten with form are solely discards o f m editation, and the first five consciousnesses are also discarded by meditation. These fifteen are discards because they are defiled, but they are not discarded by seeing because the former ten have form, and the latter five look outward. The last three elements are all three types, because the eighty- eight afflicted kernels, what is concurrent with them, and their attainment are discarded by seeing; everything else that is defiled is discarded by meditation; and the undefiled parts are not discarded.b. Refuting the VatsiputrTya's position40cd Seeing does not discard the unafflicted,N or form, nor what is not born from the sixth.According to the Vatsiputrlyas,74 ordinary individuals and the body and speech karma of the lower realms are discards of seeing, because when the path of seeing is attained, they are blocked, they say.The path of seeing does n ot discard ordinary individuals, because they are unafflicted, unobscured neutral. Ordinary individuals are proven to be un­afflicted neutral because they are neither virtuous nor afflicted. If they were virtuous, then there could be no nonvirtuous ordinary individuals and the roots of virtue could not be severed.75 If ordinary individuals were afflicted, then someone who had become detached through a worldly path would not be an ordinary individual. Since neither of these are the case, ordinary indi­viduals are proven to be unobscured neutral. Something that is unobscured neutral is pervasively not a discard of seeing, like a vase, for example. Discards o f seeing are definitely afflicted.N or does the path of seeing discard the body and speech of those in the lower realms, because they have form.Here there are four alternatives of being free of something and discarding it. The first, being free without discarding, is like the status of an ordinary in­dividual when the path of seeing is attained. The second is like the arhat s fac­ulties that have form— the arhat has abandoned them but is not free of them. The third is like discards of seeing when the path of seeing has been attained. Fourth is all the undefiled paths not included above and noncomposites.13 6"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASPECTS OF ELEMENTSN or does seeing discard the consciousnesses of the five gates and their as­sociations, because they are on a level that is not born from the sense base of mind, and because they look outward.

T he active part of the eye and part o f the element o f dharm a— the five afflicted views, the correct worldly view, the learner s view, and the nonlearner s view— are views: they are eightfold types of view. The other sixteen elements, the inactive eye, and the remaining portions of the element o f dharma are not views. The five afflicted views will be explained below.76 The correct worldly view is presented as a virtuous, defiled full knowing that is concurrent with mental consciousness. The latter two are set forth as the undefiled views of learners and nonlearners.b. Elaboration. This has six topics: i. Refuting the full knowing of faculties as view, ii. Proving that the eye is view, iii. Distinctions of the faculty perceiving the object, iv. Ascertaining the time of the support, v. The reason for supporter and supported, and vi.

The five virtuous minds or full knowings that arise in concurrence w ith five consciousnesses of the sense gates, since they are not thoughts that have the volition to recognize the object, are not view.ii. Proving that the eye is view. This has two topics.13 7"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA I(1) Actual42a The eye sees formWell then, since the eye is also nonconceptual, it should not be a view, you say. Because the active eye sees form, it is view.(2) Dispelling doubts. This has (a) Examining whether all eyes see, (b) Ex­amining whether it is eye or eye consciousness that sees, and (c) Examining whether both eyes see.(a) Examining whether all eyes see42a when it is active.Well then, do all eyes see? you ask. W hen it is active, the eye sees, but the in­active eye does not.(b) Examining whether it is eye or eye consciousness that sees42b—d Supported consciousness does not,Because a form that is obstructed C annot be seen, or so they claim.Well then, it is not the eye that sees, it is the eye consciousness it supports that sees, you say. T hat which sees is the eye. The supported consciousness that the eye supports does not. W hy is this so? Because that consciousness is un­obstructive. If it were to see, it would have to see a form that is obstructed by walls and so forth, and those cannot be seen.“O r so they claim” is the Masters skeptical word for the Great Exposition school: Later Great Expositionists thought that the eye consciousness sees and that the faculties do not see. They spoke of many faults in the faculty of eye seeing and so forth.The Sutra school explains that on the basis of eye and form, the eye cogni­tion arises. There is a conventional label of “seeing form,” and following this convention, one says, “The eye sees, the consciousness knows,” as a manner of designation, but one should not be attached to this label, they explain.(c) Examining whether both eyes see43ab Both of the eyes can see, as well,Because they both can clearly see.138"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASPECTS OF ELEMENTSDoes one eye see, or do both see? you ask. Both of the eyes see, as well, be­cause if one eye sees, it sees unclearly, but if one opens both eyes, they both can see more clearly than before. The phrase “as well” means that either one of them is capable of seeing.¡¡i. Distinctions of the faculty perceiving the object. This has two points.(1) Meeting or not meeting43cd The eye, ear, and m ind do not meetTheir objects. Three perceive elsewise.Well then, do the six faculties perceive their objects by meeting them or not? you ask. Three— the eye, ear, and m ind— do not meet their objects when they perceive them. This is because both the eye and ear see or hear forms or sounds that are far off, and as the m ind has no form, it is impossible for it to meet anything. T he three— nose, tongue, and body— perceive elsewise from not meeting: they perceive by meeting their object, because without inhaling, scent is not perceived, and it is proven that far-away tastes and touches are not perceived. The meaning of meeting and not meeting is proposed as particles striking and joining or not.(2) Equal or unequal44ab The nose and other two perceive An object that in size is equal.Do the eye and so forth perceive objects that are equal or unequal to them ­selves in size? you ask. As the nose and other two, the tongue and body, per­ceive an object that they meet, it is proposed all three perceive an object that in size is equal. They perceive just as much of the object as meets the faculty. The eye, ear, and mind, however, do not necessarily perceive things that are their own size. The eye perceives things that are larger, equal to, and smaller than itself; the ear hears sounds that are large, medium, and small; and the m ind is not corporeal, so there is no determination of its size.iv. Ascertaining the time of the support44cd The last s support is past. The five Arise together with them, too.139"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY H- AREA IThe object of the eye consciousness and so forth is always present, but the ob­ject of the m ind consciousness can be in any of the three times. Are their sup­ports the same? you ask. They are not. T he support o f the last of the six elements of consciousness, the m ind consciousness, is the immediately past mind only; it is not the present or future mind. The supports of the first five elements of consciousness, the eye and so forth, are present because they arise together w ith them , the five consciousnesses. The word “too” means, “The immediately past m ind supports them, too.”v. The reason for supporter and supported. This has two points.(1) The reason for designating just the faculty as support45ab Because when those change, they change, too,The eye and so on are the supports.If the consciousnesses arise from both the faculties and the objects, why is it that only the faculty is designated as support? you ask. The reason for that is because when those, the eye and other faculties, change, they, the conscious­nesses, change, too. Benefit or harm to the faculties, such as pain and so forth, can help or harm the consciousnesses, or create pain or pleasure in them, or make them clear or unclear. If form and so forth is changed, however, it is not definite that such a change will arise in the consciousness. Therefore, the eye and so on are the supports for m ind consciousness.(2) The reason the supports distinguish the consciousnesses45cd Because of that and being specific,Those indicate the consciousnesses.Well, if both the faculty and object produce consciousnesses, why do we say “eye consciousness” but not “form consciousness”? you ask. They are called the eye consciousness and so forth because o f that reason given above that faculties alone are the supports of the eye consciousness and so forth, like say­ing, “The King’s men.”In addition, within a single individual’s continuum, form is a cause com­mon to both the eye and mental consciousnesses, but the eye is the specific cause of the eye consciousness only. Form can also be the cause of eye con­sciousness in other individuals’ streams of being, but the eye is the cause of consciousness for only one individual. Therefore, because they are specific,140"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASPECTS OF ELEMENTSthose faculties form the basis on which we indicate the eye and so forth con­sciousnesses. It is like saying “a shoot of rice” or “the sound of a drum .”vi. Ascertaining the levels of faculty, object, consciousness, and support.This has four topics: (1) The levels of the eye, form, eye consciousness, and support, (2) Teaching that the ear is comparable to that, (3) Ascertaining the nose, tongue, and body, and (4) Teaching the m ind as uncertain.(1) The levels of the eye, form, eye consciousness, and support46. The body can not have a lower eye.The eye can not see forms of higher.Neither the consciousness. Their forms,And two of body, too, on any.Well, what body supports the consciousness? W hen the eye sees form, are the body, eye, form, and consciousness on the same level only or can they also be on different levels? you ask. W hen someone in the Desire realm looks with his own eye at a form of the Desire realm, all four are on the same level. W hen that same Desire-realm individual looks at form of the Desire realm with the eye of the first dhyana, the body and form are both on the level of Desire, but the consciousness and eye are on the level of the first dhyana. W hen he looks at forms of the first dhyana, the form is also on the level of the first dhyana.W hen the Desire-realm individual looks at his own levels forms with the eye of the second dhyana, both the body and form are on the Desire-realm individuals own level, but the eye is on the level of the second dhyana, and the eye consciousness is on the level of the first dhyana, because there is no eye consciousness above the first dhyana.77 W hen he looks at the form of the first dhyana, the eye consciousness and form are on the level o f the first dhyana, the body is of the Desire realm and the eye is on the level of the second dhyana. In the same way, the others can be extensively known.This is determined as follows: The body of a higher level can not have or support a lower level’s eye, because one has the superior eye of their own level, so there is no need to manifest the inferior eye of a lower level. T he eye of a lower level can not have the power to see the forms of higher levels, because the eye of the lower is coarse and the forms of the higher are subtle. N either is the higher level’s eye consciousness supported by a lower level’s eye, because the superior consciousness of the higher is not supported by the inferior eye o f the lower, just as a clay jug does not hold lion’s milk.78 T heir— the higher, lower, and own levels’— forms of all types are visible to the eye consciousness141"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA Iof the first dhyana as its object.

T hat is in general. In specific, when perceiving the touch of the second dhyana and above, the consciousness of body is that of the lower first dhyana. W hen someone in either Desire or the first dhyana feels a touch, they perceive it with the consciousness of their own level.(4) Teaching the mind as uncertain47d M ind is indefinite.The m ind’s object, body, and consciousness are indefinite, because sometimes they are all on a comparable level and sometimes they are on lower or higherz42"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASPECTS OF ELEMENTSlevels.

Four over two, it’s claimed.The five and eight, over all-afflicted And over the utterly pure.In the first chapter, where it says “The internal twelve are faculties,”79 what are the faculties? Where it says, “Composite dharmas are the five.. .”8° what is the manner in which these composites arise? you ask. In order to explain the answers to these questions in depth, this second area is presented.The meaning of the word faculty is as explained in the autocommentary:W hat is the meaning of faculty (indriya')? you ask. The root idi signifies supreme controlling power. Exercising power over that, they are faculties. For that reason, ex­ercising power is the meaning of faculty.There are twenty-two faculties: the five sense faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body; the m ind faculty; the faculty of life force; the male and female fac­ulties; the five feelings of pleasure, suffering, mental pleasure, mental unhap­piness, and neutral; the five of faith, diligence, mindfulness, samadhi, and full knowing; and the three undefiled of producing all-knowing, all-knowing, and having all-knowing.O f these twenty-two faculties, which faculty exercises power over what? you ask. Except for the inactive faculties,81 the five faculties of eye and so forth ex­ercise their power over four meanings each: beautifying the support, protect­ing the body, producing the consciousnesses and their concurrences, and exercising exclusive power over the perception of their own object.The four faculties of male, female, life force, and m ind each exercise power over two purposes. The first two differentiate sentient beings and differentiate their specifics, such as shape, whether they have large or small breasts, and whether they have high or low voices. The faculty of life force exercises power over rebirth-linking in a likeness82 and correctly maintaining the likeness con­tinuum. The faculty of m ind exercises power over rebirth-linking in the next existence and harmonizing the other faculties with the m ind.83 The meaning of life force exercising power over rebirth-linking is as said:If at that time, a scent-eater84 has either of two minds— a m ind associated with affection or a mind associated with anger— become m anifest...1 4 6"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE FACULTIESThe meaning of the m ind exercising power over rebirth-linking is extensively explained in the sutra that says, “This world is led by the m in d ... ” “Its claimed” is a skeptical word from the Sutra school for the Great Exposition.The five defiled feelings and the eight faculties of faith, diligence, m ind­fulness, samadhi, full knowing, producing all-knowing, all-knowing, and hav­ing all-knowing exercise respectively power over the all-afflicted and over the utterly pure. The five feelings produce greed, hatred, and delusion. During the paths of accumulation and joining, the five from faith to full knowing are the cause of the utterly pure, and in the paths of seeing, meditation, and non­learning, the eight are utterly pure in essence.b.

Now to present their own tradition: There are six faculties from eye to mind. O f these, the five internal elements wield the power to focus on their own objects, and the m ind wields power over focus on all six objects of form and so forth. For that reason, there are six distinct faculties.For exercising power over that which defines femaleness, the female faculty is presented, and for power over that which defines maleness, the male faculty is presented. The body’s female and male faculties are presented as a part of the body faculty, from which they are not separate.For exercising power to m aintain one s own likeness, over the all-afflicted, and over the utterly pure, respectively the faculty of life force, the faculties of the feelings, and the five faculties o f faith and so forth are proposed.This defines the faculties o f producing all-knowing, all-knowing, and147"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIhaving all-knowing as faculties. To exercise the power to attain the high (all­knowing), the higher (having all-knowing), and nirvana without remainder, et cetera, in order there are the three faculties o f producing all-knowing, all­knowing, and having all-knowing, which are presented. The words, “as well” mean that just as the eye and so forth are faculties, these three are also faculties. The words “et cetera” indicate that these three faculties also exercise power re­spectively to abandon the discards of seeing, to abandon the discards of med­itation, and to reside blissfully in the visible— that is, in this lifetime.2. Establishing the number of faculties. This has two points.a. The Great Exposition tradition5. There are as many faculties asThe m ind’s supports, distinctions, and That which maintains, those which afflict,Gatherers, and the utterly pure.If exercising power is a faculty, there are many powers such as creating karmic formations out of ignorance, speaking with the mouth, and so on, so fixing the number of faculties at twenty-two is illogical, you say. This is not a fault. Those exercise some small bit of power but do not exercise exclusive power, so they are not presented as faculties.Therefore to provide the m ind’s support, there are the six faculties from eye to mind. To create distinctions in the bodily support, there are the female and male faculties. To m aintain one’s likeness in a similar body, there is the life force faculty. To make the consciousnesses all-afflicted, there are the feel­ings. Because they are the basis for gathering the utterly pure accumulations, there are the five of faith and so forth. And for power over the essence of the utterly pure, the last three faculties are presented. There are this many dharmas to exercise power over, and there are as many faculties as that, so their number is determined.b. The Sutra school tradition6 . O r as supports for entry, birth,Remaining, and enjoying there are Fourteen, and likewise for the reverse There are the other faculties.O r else one can alternatively establish the number of faculties as follows: as148"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE FACULTIESthey provide support for entry into samsara, there are the six from the eye to the mind. As they are the cause for b irth in samsara, there are the male and female faculties. As it leads to rem aining there, there is the life-force faculty. A nd as they are the cause o f enjoying or m aking use o f samsara, there are the feelings. Thus there are the fourteen faculties for the purpose of entering samsara.And just as the entry into samsara has faculties for its support, birth, re­maining, and enjoyment, likewise for the reverse of samsara as well, there are the faculties that exercise power over the support, birth, remaining, and en­joyment of the utterly pure. The support for the birth of the utterly pure is the five of faith and so forth. For power over the initial birth of the utterly pure, there is the faculty of producing all-knowing. For power over remaining in the utterly pure, there is the faculty of all-knowing, and for power over en­joying the utterly pure, there is the faculty of having all-knowing. These fac­ulties are other than those that enter samsara; they are faculties that reverse samsara.3. The individual characteristics of the faculties. This has two topics: a.

Here the five faculties of feeling and the three undefiled faculties will be explained.In this section, body is proposed to mean any of the faculties that have form.

O n third dhyanaThe m ind s is the faculty of pleasure.Any pleasant feeling associated with the sense faculties is the faculty of pleas­ure. Not only that, any pleasant feeling that arises in association with the m ind on the third dhyana is the faculty of cognitive pleasure. This is because the five sense-gate consciousnesses are not present on that level, so there is no bod­ily feeling. The joy of the first two dhyanas is mental pleasure, but on the third level one is free of attachment to joy, so the pleasure felt on the third level is also not mental pleasure. Therefore, the faculty of pleasure combines the bod­ily pleasure of the sense faculties and the cognitive pleasure of the third dhyana.ii. Mental feelings of pleasure and suffering. This has two points.(1) Mental happiness8a O n others, it is mental pleasure.O n levels that are other than the third dhyana— Desire and the first two dhyanas— any pleasant feeling that is associated with the mental conscious­ness, whatever it might be, is the faculty of m ental pleasure, because on those levels one is not free of attachment to joy. The distinction between cognitive pleasure and mental pleasure is that mental joy of the levels from Desire to the second dhyana is merely produced by thought and is unstable. T hat is mental pleasure. O n the third dhyana, the pleasant feeling in the m ind that remains stably is cognitive pleasure.(2) Unhappiness8 be Unpleasant feelings in the mindAre unhappiness,Any unpleasant feelings that arise in association with the m ind consciousness are the faculty of mental unhappiness.iii.

Neutral is both bodily and mental since the m iddling neutral feelings of both body and m ind are thought-free and born from within. The feelings of pleasure and suffering of both body and mind are not like that, so they are explained separately.b. The characteristics of the three stainless faculties9ab O n the paths of seeing, meditation,And of nonlearning, nine are three.O n the paths of seeing, m editation, and of nonlearning, the nine faculties of mind, pleasure, mental pleasure, neutral feelings, and the five including faith and so forth are called the three stainless faculties.

Those seven faculties with form, the faculty of life force, and the faculty of suffering are solely defiled, because they are discarded by meditation. The nine faculties including mind, pleasure, mental pleasure, neutral, and the five of faith and so forth are twofold— either defiled or undefiled— because when they are associated with the paths of seeing, learning, and no learning, they are undefiled, but otherwise they are defiled.b.

The faculty of life force is fully ripened only, because in the higher realms it is propelled by defiled virtue, and in the lower realms it is propelled by nonvirtue.In the great Tika there is an extensive discussion of whether life force is fully ripened or not, the distinction between life force and life, proposals by Venerable Ghosaka and others, the necessity for the Teacher to prolong or for­sake his life, and so forth. The Master’s explanation is in agreement with Ven­erable Ghosaka. From the autocommentary:Therefore, that life force [of an individual who has ex­tended his life through the power of meditation] is not fully ripened, but other than that, it [life force] is fully ripened.The necessity for an arhat to prolong or forsake his life is as said:W hen one has acted well with Brahmic conduct And meditated fully on the path,There will be joy at extinguishing ones life,As if it were like being free of sickness.Twelve faculties can be either of the two— either fully ripened or not.

Except the three stainless faculties, nineteen of the faculties are found in the Desire realm. Except the male and female faculties, and the mental and bodily sufferings, fifteen of the faculties are also found in the Form realm. Those four faculties are not found there for the following reasons: Because those in the higher realms are free of desire for sex, there are no male or female faculties. Because the body is extremely pure and the cause of bodily suffering, nonvirtue, is not present, there is no bodily suffering. Because one s continuum is moistened by tranquility meditation, and the nine causes of mental unhap­piness86 have been discarded, there is no mental unhappiness.O f those fifteen faculties, in the Formless realm there are none of the five w ith form, nor are there any bodily and mental pleasures, so there are the eight faculties of life force, mind, neutrality, and the five of faith and so forth.

This is because it is possible that some might attain the state of arhat, regress from the result over and over again,91 and then re-attain it with eleven faculties, so it is taught there as eleven. Here it is taught as nine faculties in terms of attaining arhat a single time.The manner in which it is possible to attain arhat by eleven is as follows: First one attains the state of arhat with the faculty of pleasure.

Faith, carefulness, and pliancy,Equanimity, shame, modesty,Two roots, and nonhostility,And diligence are with all virtue.Faith is the sincere purity of a mind that is free of the dirt of the afflictions and near afflictions. Carefulness is to value virtuous dharmas such as faith and to protect the m ind from the defiled. And pliancy is workability of the mind that can withstand aiming toward its focus. Between immeasurable equanimity and the formation equanimity, equanimity here is the latter: it is the mind that spontaneously engages without dullness or agitation. Shame and modesty are both presented from the aspect of abstaining from the inherently un wholesome. They will be explained below.95 The two virtuous roots of non­desire and nonhatred are the antidotes for greed and hatred. Nondelusion is designated as an aspect of full knowing, so it is included within the major ground of cognition and not mentioned here. Nonhostility is a loving heart, and diligence is a mind that is excited about virtuous actions. These ten are called the virtuous major ground because they are associated with all virtuous cognitions.164"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPOSITES ARISE(c) The afflicted major ground26a-c Delusion, carelessness, and laziness,Nonfaith, and torpor, agitation:W ith all afflicted.Delusion is not knowing about karma, cause and effect, and so forth. Delusion and ignorance are equivalent. Carelessness is the opposite of carefulness: it is a mind not habituated to virtue. And laziness is the opposite of diligence: it is not being excited about virtue. Nonfaith is the opposite of faith: it is impu­rity in the mind. And torpor makes the mind unworkable and hazy. Agitation is disturbance in the mind. These six are the greater afflicted major ground because they arise w ith all afflicted cognitions.(d) The nonvirtuous major ground26cd W ith nonvirtue,Immodesty and shamelessness.In association with all nonvirtuous cognitions, immodesty and shamelessnessmust always arise.(e) The major ground of minor near afflictions27. Aggression, grudge, deceit, and envy,Contentiousness, hypocrisy,Stinginess, pretense, arrogance, andHostility: grounds of minor afflictions.Aggression is to get angry with beings who might cause harm and fight with them. Grudges or resentment is to hold a grudge after getting angry. Deceit is a mind that does not accept faults to be faults and has the aspect of fooling, and envy or jealousy is not being able to bear it when someone else has some­thing desirable. Contentiousness is to embrace misdeeds as truly fine. As it is explained, “Contentiousness is attachment to misdeeds.” Hypocrisy is to hide one’s faults and keep them secret. Stinginess is not giving dharma or material things to others out of greed for them. Pretense is to contrive that one has qualities that one really does not out of greed for goods, fame, or so forth. Ar­rogance will be taught below,96 and hostility is to wish suffering upon sentient beings. These ten are called the grounds of the m inor near afflictions because the only root affliction they are concurrent with is ignorance, because they are discarded only by meditation, and because they only arise in association with165"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA IIcognitions in the mental consciousness that are discarded by meditation. Thus the companions they are concurrent with, their class of discards, and the sup­port they arise from are all minor.W ithin these five groups there are thirty-eight mental factors. These do not include the indefinite factors, which Vasumitra and Pürnavardhana list in their commentaries:Considering, examining,Regret, and sleep, and anger, greed,And pride, and doubt, so called: these eight Are taught to be indefinite.These eight are called indefinite because unlike the major grounds, they do not definitely arise with any particular cognition.Including these eight indefinite, there are forty-six mental factors. W hy are they not all mentioned here? you ask. Although they are not explained, they can be understood from the meaning. The definite ones are explicitly taught, and the indefinite are implicitly understood.In the Great Vehicle abhidharma there are said to be fifty-one mental fac­tors. W hy are they condensed into forty-six here? you ask. As five of the Great Vehicle s factors have only nominal existence, they are not included in this enumeration of those with substantial existence. The virtuous factor of non­delusion, the root affliction view, and the near affliction of nonawareness are designations given to different aspects of full knowing. The near affliction of distraction is a designation given to one aspect of samadhi. Forgetfulness is a designation for one part of mindfulness.97(2) Which mental factors arise in association with which cognition.

Specific28d Some are augmented by regret.Some virtuous cognitions of Desire have twenty-three associated mental fac­tors because it is possible that regret might arise in association with them, so the number of mental factors is augmented by one.

This is because the major ground of cognition, the afflicted major ground, the nonvirtuous major ground, consideration, and examination arise with these cognitions. If the cognition is associated with one of the four in­definite afflictions of greed, hatred, pride, or doubt; or one of the near afflic­tions such as aggression, et cetera; or regret, then there are twenty-one, because that affliction of greed or so forth is added to the previous twenty.(iii) W hat is associated with neutral cognitions.

Unobscured neutral cognitions30ab It’s saidW ith other neutrals, there are twelve.It is said that w ith the other neutrals, the unobscured neutral cognitions, there are twelve mental factors that arise, because in addition to the major ground of cognition, consideration and examination also arise.(iv) Sleep added as a clarification30cd Since sleep does not preclude any other,Whenever it occurs, it’s added.Since sleep does not preclude any other, in that it can arise with all cognitions, whether virtuous, nonvirtuous, or neutral, whenever it occurs, associated with a principal cognition, it is added.

This is because regret and sleep are incompatible with samadhi, and one s continuum has been moistened by tranquility, so there is no non­virtue.B.

Shamelessness is disrespect for qualities and those who have qualities169"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIsuch as one’s abbot, masters, and so forth. Immodesty is to view the unwhole­some, such as killing and so forth, w ithout fear.101(b) The distinction between affection and respect. This has two points.(i) Actual32c Affections faith; respect is shame.Affection is faith in qualities and those who have qualities, and respect is shame that honors qualities and those who have qualities. Faith and respect in either qualities or individuals can also be presented as having four possibil­ities.(ii) What realms these are in32d These two are in Desire and Form.Those two, affection and respect toward individuals, are found in the Desire and the Form realms, but they are not found in the Formless because in that realm individuals are not within each others sphere of perception.(c) The distinction between consideration and examination33ab Considering and examining Are coarse and fine.There is a distinction between considering and examining: they are respec­tively the coarse and fine mental factors that engage the aspects of the object’s essence and particulars.Well then, it is illogical that these both could arise simultaneously around a single cognition, you say. It is logical because by their combined power, the cognition becomes neither too coarse nor too fine. For example, if you were to put butter in cold water and then place it in the sun, by the power of both the water and the sun the butter would get neither too hot nor too cold. Some say that the explanation of both considering and examining arising in association with a single cognition is in terms of a continuum, but they are not simultaneous.170"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPOSITES ARISE(d) The distinction between pride and arrogance33b—d Pride is self-inflation.Arrogance is clinging to one’s featuresWhich then consumes the mind completely.Pride and arrogance are separate because pride is the self-inflation of thinking that one is superior to others in terms social standing and qualities, while ar­rogance is clinging to one s own features, such as social standing or body, which then consumes or uses up the m ind completely.(4) Teaching synonyms. This has two points.(a) Synonyms of cognition34ab Cognition, mind, and consciousness Are equivalent.In the sutras where it says, “Cognition, mind, and consciousness,” what is the distinction between these three? There are many assertions of distinctions be­tween these three in the Great Exposition, Sutra, and Yogic Conduct schools, but in our own tradition, the element of cognition, the sense base of mind, and the aggregate of consciousness are equivalent.The Great Exposition school proposes that as they distinguish between virtue, nonvirtue, and so forth, they are presented as cognitions. As they know form and so forth, they are mind. As they know distinctions in the object, they are presented as consciousness.(b) Parallels with mental factors34b -d The mind and factorsHave a support, a focus, aspects,Concurrence also that is fivefold.The m ind or mental factors are equivalent in having the eye and so forth as support, having a focus on form and so forth, and having an aspect such as thinking, “Blue!”The concurrence also between mind and mental factors is fivefold: there is concurrence of support, focus, aspect, time, and substance.171"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIb.

The first has two: getting something anew, such as the first undefiled moment, and getting after regressing, such as getting what one had previously regressed from when attaining the actual practice of the dhyanas and formless absorptions. The attainment of having also has two: possessing the continuum, such as the second moment of the vows of indi­vidual liberation where one possesses the continuum of the first moment, and172"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPOSITES ARISEpossession from the beginning, such as ordinary individuals who possess the afflictions of existence from the very beginning.(b) What they are of. This has two points.(i) General36cd Attainment, nonattainment are of W hat is in one’s streamAttainm ent and nonattainm ent are of composites that are included in one s own stream of being, not of what is included in another being’s continuum or not included in anyone’s continuum.(ii) Specifics36d or two cessations.The two noncomposite cessations are not connected with anyone’s continuum, but since that which they negate can be connected to beings’ continuums, there is attainment and nonattainment of the two cessations. Nonanalytic ces­sation is possessed by all sentient beings because it is said in the abhidharma:W ho possesses undefiled dharmas? you ask. Answer.All sentient beings.Analytic cessation is possessed by all nobles except those in the first moment who still have all the bonds.102 It is also possessed by certain ordinary individ­uals. There is no possession of space, so therefore there is no attainment of it either. If something cannot be attained, there is no nonattainment of it either, it is said in this school.The Great Exposition says that there are many scriptural and logical proofs that attainment and nonattainment are substantial. The Master makes many criticisms of this. From the commentary:Therefore this possession and nonpossession are in all aspects nominal dharmas, and they are not substantial dharmas.Some Great Expositionists reply, “You make many harmful logical criticisms, but we will not give up the position that possession, nonpossession, attain­ment, and nonattainm ent are substantial because it is the position of our173"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIschool.” So they say, but such is the speech of someone who cannot distinguish whether he is querying or replying. In this land of Tibet, too, such fools who cannot bear losing a debate say, “W hether or not this position of mine is com­patible with the sutras and tantras, it holds.” Many such people turn their backs and listen to the echoes of their own voices.The characteristic of attainment is a nonconcurrent formation that is the substance that makes one possess the dharma that is attained.(c) Distinctions. This has two topics: (i) Distinctions of attainment, and (ii) Distinctions of nonattainment.(i) Distinctions of attainment. This has six topics: A. Distinctions of time,B. Distinctions of essence, C. Distinctions of realm, D. Distinctions of learner and nonlearner, E. Distinctions of whether or not it is discarded, and E The particulars of the distinction of time.A. Distinctions of time37a Attainment of three times is threefold;The attainm ent of that which is attained, dharmas of the three times, is three­fold: there are past, future, and present attainments. The attainments are like the supreme bull or garuda in the fore, like the body and its shadow, or like a calf pulled behind.B.

The attainment of a Desire-realm dharmas is itself included in the De­sire realm. It is the same in the other realms.The attainment of what is not in a realm— the two cessations and the truth174"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPOSITES ARISEof the path— is fourfold. It can be included in Desire, Form, Formless, and not included in any of the three realms. The attainment of nonanalytic cessa­tion can be in any of three realms. The attainment of analytic cessation of Form or Formless attained by a worldly path is of either Form or Formless. The attainment of analytic cessation by a transworldly path and the attainment of the truth of the path are not included in any of the three realms.D. Distinctions of learner and nonlearner38a O f neither learner nor non, three;Learner means the undefiled paths of seeing and meditation, and nonlearner means the undefiled path of no-learning. The attainment of these two is, in order, learner and nonlearner. W hat is neither learner nor nonlearner is either defiled or noncomposite. There are three types of attainment of these two: the attainment of defiled dharmas or nonanalytic cessation and the attainment of analytic cessation by the worldly path are neither learner nor nonlearner. The attainment of these through the path of the learner is learner, and their attainment through the path of the nonlearner is nonlearner. Although it is on the path of learning, the path of no obstacles of the vajra-like samadhi forms the support for the attainment of removal that is the nonlearner path of liberation, so it is designated as nonlearner’s attainment.E. Distinctions of whether or not it is discarded38b O f what is not abandoned, twofold.The attainment of the discards of seeing and meditation are in order discards of seeing and meditation. The attainment of w hat is not abandoned by either seeing or meditation is proposed to be twofold: it is either a discard of medi­tation or it is not a discard. The attainment of nonanalytic cessation and the attainment of analytic cessation through worldly paths are abandoned by med­itation. The attainment of analytic cessation through noble paths and the at­tainment of the truth of the path are not discarded.F. The particulars of the distinction o f time. This has three points.1. The particulars o f unobscured neutral38cd Neutral attainment: at same time,Except clairvoyance, emanations.I75"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIThe particulars of “Attainment of three times is threefold” are as follows: Well then, must attainment definitely arise in all three times or not? you ask. Not necessarily. Unobscured neutral attainm ent arises at the same time as the at­tained dharma. It does not arise earlier or later because it does not have man­ifest action and is weak.However, not all attainments of unobscured neutral are simultaneous with the arising of the dharma. Excepted are the attainments of the two clairvoy­ances of divine eye and ear, and the neutral emanated mind. The attainment of these three arises in all three times because they are accomplished by specific training and therefore are strong.2. The particulars of obscured neutral3 9 a O f form of the obscured, as well.The attainment of the form o f the obscured neutral, as well, such as the per­ceptible form of Great Brahmas lips moving when he deceives his entourage, does not arise earlier or later but arises simultaneously because the motivation is weak and the form is material.3. The particulars of virtuous and nonvirtuous39b In Desire, of forms does not precede.In Desire, the attainment of the perceptible forms of virtuous and nonvirtuous conduct and of the imperceptible forms of vows and wrong vows103 does not arise preceding the dharma that is attained but does arise at the same time as or later than it.However, the attainment of the forms of the dhyana vows and the undefiled vows made manifest in the Desire realm is strong and follows the mind, so it is in all three times.(ii) Distinctions of nonattainment. This has five points.A. Distinctions of essence3 9 c Nonattainm ent is unobscured neutral;N onattainm ent is unobscured neutral only because those who have aban­doned afflictions and those who have severed the roots of virtue both pos­sess them, so they can be neither afflicted nor virtuous. Its characteristics are176"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPOSITES ARISEa nonconcurrent formation that is exclusive of attainment and unobscured neutral.B. Distinctions of time3 9 d O f past and unborn, it is threefold.The nonattainment of past and unborn future dharmas, it is threefold as ithas aspects of all three times. Present dharmas have no present nonattainment, because it is impossible for the attainment and nonattainment of a particular dharma to coexist simultaneously.C. Distinctions o f realm40a O f Desire, et cetera, and the stainless, too.The nonattainment of dharmas of Desire, et cetera, the three realms, are in­cluded in those same realms. And the nonattainment of the stainless, unde­filed dharmas can be in any of the three realms, too, because it is included within the continuum of the beings of those realms.D. No undefiled nonattainment40bc Paths nonattainment is asserted as An ordinary being.The undefiled paths nonattainm ent is nonattainment, and those who have it in their beings are asserted as an ordinary being. The reason is explained in the Treatise:104W hat is the ordinary individual itself? The nonattain­ment of the nobles’ dharmas.Another reason is because there is no undefiled nonattainment. Well then, is this nonattainment of the nobles’ dharmas set forth as the nonattainment of nobles’ dharmas in general or nonattainment of individual dharmas? you ask. It is set forth as nonattainment in general.Here there are distinctions and disagreements between the Great Exposition and Sutra schools, and the Master’s explanation is in accord with the tradition of the Sutra school. According to him, a stream of being in which noble dhar­mas have not arisen is an ordinary individual. A stream of being in which they177"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIhave arisen is a noble individual. He does not present ordinary individual as a dharma distinct from individual.E. Distinctions of the way they regress40cd It’s forfeitedW hen one attains that or shifts level.It, that nonattainment, is forfeited when one attains that, a noble dharma, or shifts level from lower to higher, such as from Desire to Form.Well then, is there the nonattainment of nonattainment and the attainment of attainment and so forth? you ask. Those do exist, but according to the Great Exposition tradition there is not an endless cycle of attainments of attainments of attainments, and so forth. From the autocommentary:Do the attainment and nonattainment of attainment and nonattainment exist? Reply. Both of both exist.Therefore, does it not follow that attainments become infinite? Because they possess each other mutually, they do not consequently become infinite. Included in the nature of dharmas, three arise: the dharma, its attain­ment, and the attainm ent of the attainment. Thus when the attainment arises, one possesses the attain­ment of the attainment, and when the attainment of attainment arises, only attainment is possessed, so for that reason it is not infinite.Alas, says the Master, in this tradition of infinite attainments, the attainments are having a grand feast. Fortunately, they are unobstructive so there is room to move, but were it otherwise there would not be room for a second living being in all of space. So it is explained.Nonattainment is finite.(2) Same status41 a Same status: sentient beings’ resemblance.Same status is what makes sentient beings be comparable to or resemble one another in conduct, nature, thought, and so forth. Its characteristic is a non­concurrent formation that is the substance that makes sentient beings resemble one another. To classify it, there are two: not separate and separate. The first is like all sentient beings, who merely by being sentient beings are the same178"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPOSITES ARISEclass. The second is like gods and humans, bhikshus and novices, and so forth, where the substances that create the similarity among them are separate from the beings themselves.(3) The explanation of nonconception. This has three points.(a) Identifying the character base41 be Conception-free stops mind and factorsO f beings in Conception Free.Conception-free is the substance that stops the m ind and mental factors of beings in Conception Free, gods who take birth there for five hundred great aeons.(b) Which of the four results it is4 ld Full ripening.It is the fully ripened result of the conception-free absorption because it has no compatible cause with separate substance, and because it is not produced by development as they have no form.(c) What level it is on41 d They’re in Great Result.They, these gods, live in one part of Great Result, the highest level of dhyana attainable by ordinary beings— their abode is not a different sort of place from Great Result. This is similar, for example, to the levels of Great Brahma and Brahmas Ministers, which are not different realms.The characteristic of a being in Conception Free is the result of the con­ception-free absorption that is the substance of cessation in the continuum of the long-lived gods.Do such gods have no consciousness at all? you ask. They do have some consciousnesses because consciousness arises at birth and death. The Master explains that because concurrences of body and mind have ceased, these are nominal, but they are not substantial.(4) The explanation of the two absorptions. This has two topics: (a) Explain­ing their individual essences, and (b) Teaching their supports together.179"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY AREA II(a) Explaining their individual essences. This has two topics: (i) The essence of conception-free absorption, and (ii) The essence of the conception-free absorption.(i) The essence of the conception-free absorption42. Likewise conception-free absorption.Last dhyan. From wishing for release.It’s virtue. Experienced on birth only.N ot nobles. Gained in one time only.Just as beings in Conception Free stop mind and mental factors, likewise the conception-free absorption also stops mental factors, because it is the cause of beings in Conception Free — it has such beings as its results.Its level is the last, fourth dhyana, because its fully ripened result ripens in Great Result. It is the contemplation of entering absorption from wishing for the definite release of liberation— the individual who enters it conceives of the being in Conception Free as liberated and the absorption that achieves that as the path. That individual strives for pure conduct through the wrong path. It, the absorption, is virtuous in motivation. That virtue is experienced on birth only105 because it causes one to take the existence of Conception Free in the next birth. The only ones who enter it are ordinary individuals; it is not entered by noble individuals, who see it as an abyss. It is never attained in the past or the future; it is gained in the one time of the present only, like the vows of individual liberation.Its characteristic is an absorption that stops mind and mental factors and that is included in the level of the fourth dhyana.(ii) The essence of the absorption of cessation. This has three points.A. Actual43. Cessation’s like that, too. Its purposeIs staying. Born on Peak, it’s virtue.Experienced in two or indefinite,The nobles attain it by training.The absorption of cessation is the cessation of mind and mental factors, just like that, the conception-free absorption, too. This absorption does not place attention on emancipation, but rather one enters it for the purpose of staying within the pacification of conceptions and feelings. The mental support it is180"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPOSITES ARISEborn on is the Peak of Existence, because it is easiest to stop the mind and concurrent mental factors right after that subtlest of subtle minds. W hat m o­tivates it is virtue. Its karmic ripening is experienced either on rebirth or in other lifetimes because it can be experienced in two instances: in the next life one is either reborn on the Peak of Existence or in the Form realm and then in the lifetime after that on the Peak. O r it can be experienced indefinitely because one could attain nirvana on the same support as one attained the ab­sorption. Its characteristic is an absorption that stops the concurrences and that is included in the level of the Peak of Existence. Only noble individuals can support it; the childish cannot. Even the nobles do not attain it merely by becoming detached; they attain it by training, which includes efforts that produce mental strength. Like the vows of individual liberation, it is only at­tained in the present; there is no past or future attainment of it.B. The specifics of how it is attained44a The Sage by awakening.The Sage’s absorption of cessation does not depend upon training; it is some­thing that is attained by acquiring awakening or the enlightenment that is the knowing of extinction and nonarising. It does not depend upon training, be­cause as is said in a sutra:You who are ultimate virtueHave nothing at all come from training.Whatever you wish for is certain:Just by the mere wish its obtained.C. The elaboration44ab N ot first,Since it was gained by thirty-four moments.Some Kashmiris in the Western school say that the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree and produced the path of seeing. Then he arose from that absorp­tion and entered the absorptions of the Peak of Existence and lower levels. Others respond that the Bodhisattva did not make those manifest at first, be­fore he attained the knowledge of extinction. This is since he produced the sixteen moments of clear realization of truth, the nine paths of no-obstacles of the path of meditation that are the antidotes for the Peak and the nine paths of liberation without interruption. After that it, enlightenment, was gained181"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY AREA IIby these thirty-four moments. Earlier when he was an ordinary individual studying with Arada and Udraka, the Bodhisattva had become detached from and abandoned all the discards of meditation of lower levels from Desire to Nothingness. In actuality, he did not need to abandon the lower levels afflicted discards of seeing.In the tradition of the Foundation Vehicle, ordinary individuals cannot pro­duce the absorption of cessation. However, the Kartik explains that according to the Highest Mantra ordinary individuals can have the samadhi of listeners’ cessation of absorption.(b) Teaching their supports together44cd Both have support of Desire and Form.Cessation is first among humans.Both of these absorptions have as bodily support the realms o f Desire and Form, but they do not have the Formless as their support. This is because be­ings in Conception Free are the result of the fourth dhyana, and because the absorption of cessation is made manifest by the body, but there is no body in the Formless realm.In general both of these absorptions have the two realms as support, but there is a distinction: when cessation has not previously arisen, it must be pro­duced first among humans, because the concurrences there are coarse, so one grows weary with them. In the Form realm, the concurrences are pacified, so there is no weariness, and for that reason one does not meditate on it there first. If one has previously attained cessation but regressed from it, it is pro­duced in the Form realm by the power of previous habituation. The concep­tion-free absorption does not come from such weariness; rather one enters it by the wrong view that conceives of it as liberation.Well then, if there is no mind while one is in these absorptions, where does the mind that arises from them come from? you ask. The Great Exposition proposes that the past mind also has substantial existence, so it arises from that. The Sutra school proposes that mind and body contain each others’ seeds, so the body that has faculties also has the seeds of the mind, from which the m ind arises. The M ind Only school proposes that when one is in either of these absorptions, the all-ground exists unceasingly, so the mind of arising is born from that.182"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPOSITES ARISE(5) The explanation of life force45ab Life force is life. It is that whichSupports one’s warmth and consciousness.The faculty of life force is the life of beings in the three realms. It, life, is that which supports or causes ones w arm th and consciousness to remain contin­ually. In the lower two realms, it provides the support for both of those, and in the Formless for consciousness only. Its characteristic is a nonconcurrent formation that is life.(6) The explanation of the characteristics.

There, in order to produce weariness among disciples, staying is taught only implicitly, which makes that teaching provisional.

It does not become endless. This is be­cause they engage eight dharmas or else one dharma: birth, for example, en­gages in the production of the three of aging, staying, and impermanence, the four of birth of birth and so forth, and one character base such as a vase, for a total of eight. The birth of birth engages in the production of the dharma of birth only. Aging and so forth are known to be the same.The characteristics of the four are as follows. A nonconcurrent formation that is the substance which makes the composite that is its character base pos­sess arising is the characteristic of birth. A nonconcurrent formation that is the substance which makes the composite that is its character base grow old is the characteristic of aging. A nonconcurrent formation that is the substance which makes the composite that is its character base remain is the characteristic of staying. A nonconcurrent formation that is the substance which makes the composite that is its character base disintegrate is the characteristic of im­permanence.(¡¡i) Refuting the logical absurdity46cd W ithout the causes or conditions,Birth cant produce what is produced.If future birth produces composites, then why do not the future composites arise all at once? you ask. According to this presentation, future composites will not arise at once, because w ithout the assembly of cause and the condi­tions, birth alone can not produce that which is produced.(7) The explanation of names, words, and letters. This has two topics:(a) Essence, and (b) Particulars.(a) Essence47ab Collections of names and so forth areCollections of names, speech, and letters.The “Collections of names and so forth, too... ” mentioned earlier are the collection of names,106 speech, and letters. The characteristic of a name is a nonconcurrent formation that tells merely the essence of the meaning. Its char­acter base is like saying, “Vase,” for example.Speech and word are equivalent, because it is said in the Commentary; “Speech is w ords...” The characteristic of either speech or word is a noncon­current formation that indicates the combination of the essence and particulars184"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPOSITES ARISEof the meaning.

This has four points.(i) Distinctions of level47c Desire and Form.These three collections are included only in Desire and Form, because they arise in dependence upon speech. Some say that there are words in Formless, but the Great Exposition says that is illogical. If you examine it further, how­ever, the three collections of names, words, and letters that are formations, both that with which the mind speaks and that which the mind says, are in the Formless, because as is said, “The melodious banner is heard in all three worlds.” So is it explained in the Kartik.(ii) Distinctions of whether they indicate beings47c Indicate beings.They arise from beings’ efforts and are in the collection of aggregates included within a stream of being, so they indicate beings; that is, they are included in a being’s continuum.(iii) Distinctions of sources47d CompatibleAs they are produced by a cause of same status,108 they are causally compatible only.

The Commentary explains it thus, but the Prince explains that these three have both virtuous and neutral aspects.

W hich is the virtuous? you ask. The perceptible speech of the Tatha- gata uttered with a virtuous mind. Which is the neutral? you ask. The perceptible speech of the Tathagata uttered with a neutral mind. Also, following this, “This which is called the Buddhas speech, what kind of dharma is it?” you ask.

Thus these are the six causes, it is proposed by the Great Exposition school.Well then, since the abhidharma is an explanation of the sutras, what sutra teaches the six causes? you ask. The Great Exposition says that the sutras that teach the six causes have mostly disappeared. However, they are explained in the treatise entrusted to Katyayana by the gods, they say.2.

The potent enabling cause, such as the eye producing the eye consciousness or a seed producing a stalk, is char­acteristic. The impotent is like noncomposite as the cause of a stalk, or hell as the cause of the Formless. The impotent enabling cause is a mere designation of that which does not block the arising of a result as a cause. It is, for example,187"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIas when a king does not oppress his subjects and they say, “This king makes us happy.”b. Coemergent cause.

These are presented as coemergent cause and result in terms of their mere isolate,110 and will be discussed thoroughly, below.(2) The manner in which they follow mind51 cd They follow mind in terms of time,Results, et cetera, virtue, et cetera.The manner in which they follow the m ind is in terms of being at the same"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"CAUSES, CONDITIONS, AND RESULTStime as mind, having the same results, et cetera, and being the same in virtue, et cetera. In detail, there are ten ways in which they follow mind: i) time in general; in particular, 2) arising, 3) staying, and 4) disintegrating; 5) the dom­inant, personal, or removal result; 6) causally compatible result, and 7) fully ripened result; 8) virtue, 9) nonvirtue, and 10) neutral. In these ten ways, they mutually follow each other and arise, making cause and result, it is said.The word same does not mean they are the same substance: if the principal mind is virtuous, then because the mental factors are similarly virtuous and comparable, they are said to be the same. Saying here that they follow by ten causes is not in terms of substance, but in terms of type. This is because virtue, nonvirtue, and neutral do not follow the same mind because it is impossible for neutral and undefiled minds to either have a fully ripened result or be the same, and because it is impossible for birth, staying, and disintegrating to be the same.There are many ways to count four possibilities or so forth of cause and caused, but I shall not say them.A few words here:Renowned as good, they cling to bad traditions of scholasticism;Pretending to be learned, they are shrouded in dark ignorance.While they’ve been sleeping in the darkness of a lesser mind,They who presumed to be delighting in the heavens of the scriptures Have now become old men, while those with young intelligence Teach themselves their own wonders.

Overview52a Same status cause is similar,The character base for the same status cause of is all past and present com­posites with the exception of the last aggregates of an arhat,111 because earlier ones produce and make possible later, similar ones. The virtuous five aggre­gates arise from a virtuous cause of same status, but within virtuous dharmas, defiled virtue and undefiled virtue are separate classes. They are similar to virtues within their own class, but merely being virtues does not make them similar. Otherwise it would follow that the first undefiled moment would arise from a cause of same status.Afflicted dharmas are similar to nonvirtue. The obscured neutral are similar189"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIto the afflicted. The obscured neutral and nonvirtue are mutually similar. The neutral is also similar to neutral.ii. The explanation. This has four points.(1) Similarities of the defiled52b Own class and level,The five classes of discards— four classes of discards of seeing, and one of dis­cards of meditation— and the nine levels of the three realms produce results of their own class and own, same level. These are same status, but when the class and level are different, they are not, because their status is unequal.(2) Distinction of time52b born before.Composites that are born before— the past and the present composites— are causes of same status of what has not been born, but the future composites are not, because there is no future cause of same status.(3) Particular explanation of the undefiled52cd Nine levels’ paths are mutual,O f equal or superior.Well then, must the cause of same status definitely be of the same level and class only? you ask. For the defiled, it definitely must be so, but the nine levels’ undefiled paths the may be m utual causes of same status even if not compa­rable in level. This is because the paths happen to be on those levels only cir­cumstantially and so do not crave the levels and make them their own. Therefore they are not included in the realms. However, they are not the same status cause of lower levels but of the equal or superior levels. Dharma for­bearance of suffering is the same status cause for equal, later dharmas of its own class, the superior dharma knowing of suffering, and the paths of seeing, meditation, and no learning.Similarly, the five faculties of faith and so forth, in terms of gradual purifi­cation, are the cause of same status for the six individuals: the pair of fol­lowers of faith and dharma, the pair of conviction through faith and attain­ment through seeing, and the pair of occasional and nonoccasional arhats.190"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"CAUSES, CONDITIONS, AND RESULTSAlternatively, they are the causes of followers of dharma, attainment through seeing, and nonoccasional arhats.112(4) Teaching how the worldly produced by training is comparable53ab Produced by training is just those two.From listening, reflecting, so forth.N ot only the undefiled, but worldly virtue produced by training is the same status cause of just those two, the equal and superior. For example, this is like qualities produced by training such as those arisen from listening and reflect­ing and so forth, those produced by meditation.The characteristic of the cause of same status is a cause that produces a result of a similar class as itself.d. Concurrent cause5 3 cd Concurrent cause is mind and factors W ith a support that is concurrent.The concurrent cause is m ind and the mental factors w ith concurrence only: they have a support, focus, aspect, time, and substance that are concur­rent.

Five.The universal cause is the common cause o f its afflicted results. It produces results on its own level. The universal cause arises prior to its result. Its char­acteristic is a discard of seeing that which is the specific cause of its afflicted results. The character base is the thirty-three universal kernels113 of the three realms and that which is associated with them except for their attainment. It is the common cause of the five classes of afflictions.114f. Cause of full ripening54cd Full-ripening cause can only be Nonvirtue or a defiled virtue.The cause of full ripening has a strong essence and the moisture of craving.191"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IINeutral dharmas have the moisture of craving, but are weak, like a rotten seed. Undefiled dharmas have strength but no moisture, without which they are like dried-up seeds. For that reason, the full-ripening cause can only be a non­virtue or a defiled virtue. Its characteristic is a nonneutral dharma that is a cause that produces the full ripening of its result.3. Identifying their times as a summary55 ab The universal and same statusAre in two times; three in three times.The universal and same status causes are in the two times of past and present only, and not in the future, because in the future there is no earlier or later. The three causes of coemergent, concurrent, and full ripening are in all three times, because they are recognized in all three. The enabling cause is in the three times. It can also be free of time because potent enabling causes are in­cluded in any one of the three times and impotent enabling causes are without time.B. The explanation of results. This has two topics: 1. Overview, and 2. Ex­planation.1. Overview55 cd Composites and removal areResults. Noncompounds don’t have those.All composites are results that have causes because they must depend upon causes. Analytic cessations and the removal of what is abandoned by the an­tidote, are results that do not depend upon causes. Because they are neither clearly desired nor something to accomplish, space and nonanalytic cessation are not results. For that reason, from the Treatise:W hat dharmas are results? you ask. All composites and analytic cessation.Here, because noncomposites are explained as results, they must have a cause, and because in the section on enabling causes they are explained as causes, they must also have a result. For that reason, it follows that they are composite, you say. There is a common ground between noncomposites and result, but noncomposites do not have a cause, because they do not have any of those192"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"CAUSES, CONDITIONS, AND RESULTSsix causes. This is because it is impossible for any of the six causes to be the cause of nonanalytic cessation, and it is impossible for the five results to be noncomposite. Well then, perhaps the path is the enabling cause of nonana­lytic cessation? you think. It is not, because analytic cessation is noncomposite and has no birth, and because at the time that analytic cessation is arising and exists, the path is not something that does not block it.2. Explanation. This has two topics: a. W hich result is of which cause, and b. The essences of the five results.a. Which result is of which cause56 Full-ripened result is of the last;The dom inant result, of first.Compatible: same status and The universal. Personal, two.Well then, what causes are these the results of? you ask. The fully ripened re­sult is the result o f the last cause, full ripening. The dom inant result is the result of the first, the enabling cause.How is it that an impotent enabling cause that merely does not hinder has power over a dominant result? you ask. It has the power of not hindering. For example, the five collections of consciousness have the ten sense bases as the enabling cause that produces them. The container of the world has karma as enabling cause. The ear also by continuum has the power to produce any eye consciousness, because from hearing something, the desire to look arises. Sim­ilarly, from grasping something, the desire to look arises and so forth.The causally compatible result is the result of both the same status and the universal causes.The personal result is the result of the two coemergent and concurrent causes. In the personal result, there is not necessarily a person who does the making; rather it is designating a mere dharma as a person, like calling a med­icine “crowfoot.” The actions and qualities of a mere dharma are not separate from the dharma itself, so its personal action is called merely personal. The re­sult of that is the personal result.b. The essences of the five results. This has five points.193"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA IIi. The essence of the fully ripened result57ab Fully ripened is a neutral dharma,Shows beings, not neutral, born later.The fully ripened result is a nonobscured neutral dharma, because if it were either virtuous or afflicted it would follow that neither individuals who have severed the roots of virtue nor arhats would possess them, and because if it were obscured neutral it would be illogical to enter the state without remainder from a mind produced by full ripening.The phrase, “shows beings” means that it is included within the stream of an individuals being, because if it were not included, one s particular karmic actions would be wasted or fall upon those who did not do them. Some results produced by development and causally compatible results are also included within beings continuums, but in contrast with those, the cause of the fully ripened result is not neutral. There are also absorptions in the dhyana and emanated minds produced by samadhi that are neutral, included in a beings continuum, and born from a not-neutral karma, but unlike those, the fully ripened result is born later than its cause— it is neither immediately following nor simultaneous.ii. The essence of the causally compatible result57 c Compatible is like its cause.The causally compatible result is like or similar to its cause, whether that cause is virtuous, afflicted, or unobscured neutral. If it is from a cause of same status, it must have a similar continuum and aspect. If it is from a uni­versal cause, the aspect is not necessarily similar, but it must be similar in terms of its continuum, level, and whether it is afflicted. Therefore, there are four possibilities of things that have a cause of same status but not a universal cause, etc.iii. The essence of the result of removal57d Removal is to mentally 58a Extinguish,Removal is attained by mentally, or through distinctive full knowing, extin­guishing or abandoning discards. Extinguishing is equivalent to cessation. It is said to refute that mere nonattainment is removal, Purnavardhana explains.194"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"CAUSES, CONDITIONS, AND RESULTSiv. The essence of the personal result58ab and the result bornFrom something’s power is personal.And the result born from or attained through something s power is similar to what is made by persons, so it is personal. The character base is all composites that have arisen from causes in that manner. From the autocommentary:For example, from a lower levels mind of training, the samadhi of the higher; from defiled, undefiled; from the mind of dhyana the emanated mind.There are four possibilities of causally compatible result and personal result.v. The essence of the dominant result58cd Composites that aren’t previous areThe dominant of composites only.Composites that have not previously arisen, prior to the cause itself—com­posites that arise at the same time or later than their cause— are the dom inant result of composite causes. The causes are different from the result itself and arise either earlier or at the same time only. The word “only” indicates that composites that arise later and noncomposites do not have the power to hold or issue results, so they are not presented as having dominant results.There is no result that is born prior to its cause, because that would render the cause meaningless. For example, it is impossible to first be a wheel-wielding emperor and later accumulate the karma that produces that result. Nor does one see shoots preceding seeds or other results preceding their cause.The distinction between personal and dom inant results is whether or not it is the result of a particular agent only. For example, a thing that is made is a personal result, and it is also the dominant result of all composites that are simultaneous or prior to it. There are also four alternatives of personal result and dominant result. The result of removal is a personal result but not a dom­inant result. Results whose cause has disappeared or been interrupted are dom­inant results but not personal. Simultaneous or immediately following composites are both. Space and nonanalytic cessation are neither.195"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIC. The explanation of dharmas common to causes and results. This has two topics: 1. Times when causes hold and issue results, and 2 . W hat results are produced by how many causes.1. Times when causes hold and issue results. This has two points.a. Holding59 a The five hold a result in the present.The five latter causes not including the enabling cause hold and attain the power to produce results in, among the three times, the present. This is be­cause they cease in the second moment, so there is no action of holding then, and the future is unborn, so there is no action in it. The enabling cause also holds its result in the same way, but as it does not necessarily produce a result, it is not mentioned.b. Issuing59 b—d Two causes issue in the present.Two present and past causes issue,And one past cause issues results.The two coemergent and concurrent causes, occur at the same time as their results, so they issue their result in the present, or pra- in Sanskrit, which is used in the meaning of first. As they issue their result from the first, holding and issuing are at the same time. Two types of present and past causes, the same status and universal causes, issue results.115 Some Tibetans explain that it would be better to translate this line as, “And two through the present and past.” And the one past cause of full ripening issues its result from the past only, because the full ripening does not arise either simultaneously with or immediately following its cause.2.

The afflicted, fully ripened, others,And the first noble respectively Arise from all except full ripening,Universal, those two, and same status.Well, how many causes is a dharma produced by? you ask. Here there are four types of dharmas: i) those that are afflicted, 2) those produced by full ripening,3) the others not included in the other three categories— unobscured neutral not produced by full ripening such as the paths of conduct, crafts, emanated minds; and virtues other than the first undefiled moment— and 4) the first noble or first undefiled moment. Respectively, the first type arises from all the causes except the cause of full ripening. The second is born from all except the universal. The third is born from all except for those two, the full ripening and universal. And the fourth is born all except for the same status. They are born from the rest of the causes not mentioned.They are not born from those causes for the following reasons. 1) The afflicted is not born from a cause of full ripening because it is afflicted. 2) The fully ripened result is not produced by a universal cause because it is not afflicted. 3) The third type is not produced by full ripening or universal cause because it is neither afflicted nor fully ripened. 4) The first noble moment is not born from same status because there is no prior undefiled of similar class.ii.

The explanation of conditions. This has two topics: 1. Brief overview, and2. Explanation.1. Brief overview6 lc There are four conditions, it is taught.Above where it says, “W ithout the causes or conditions,” what are the con­ditions? you ask.

The essence of each of the four conditions, b. W hich conditions operate at which time, c. Which things arise from how many conditions, and d. A specific explanation of the immediate condition.a. The essence of each of the four conditions. This has four points.i. Causal condition6 Id The one called causal is five causes.The one called the causal condition is any one of the five causes not including the enabling cause. It is something that benefits its result. Its character base is composite dharmas.198"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"CAUSES, CONDITIONS, AND RESULTSii. Immediate condition62ab The mind and factors that have arisen,But not the last, are immediate.The concurrent immediate condition is m ind and mental factors that have arisen in the past or present, but not the last mind and mental factors of an arhat. Other than that, all mind and mental factors are the concurrent imme­diate condition.As for concurrence, in a single being’s continuum, there can not be two si­multaneous cognitions of the same substantial type, so the concurrences are comparable to each individual mental substance.116 This condition may be sep­arated from its result in terms of time, but it cannot be interrupted by another cognition. Thus it is the condition of immediate arising.Form is not able to be a concurrent immediate condition because it arises in dissimilar classes interrupted by others. For example, right after the imper­ceptible form of Desire, the form of Desire realms vow of individual liberation, the Form realms vow of dhyana, or an undefiled dharma might all arise, which confuses the classes.Here there are four alternatives between being the concurrent immediate result of a cognition and immediately following a cognition, and also four al­ternatives between being the concurrent immediate result of mind and im­mediately following absorption. These are discussed at length in the Great Kartik, so refer there.iii. Objective condition62c The objective is all dharmas, andThe objective condition of an eye consciousness and so forth, including its concurrences, is its own object of defiled form and so forth, which is a present dharma. The objective condition of the mind consciousness is all defiled and undefiled dharmas of the three times, or that are not included in time. The objective conditions characteristic is a dharma that is suitable to be an object.W hy then, if all dharmas are the objective condition of mind consciousness, so are noncomposites. Therefore, noncomposites must be things, because they have the function of producing a result, you say.The Great Exposition agrees that noncomposites are things, but if they pro­duced a result, they would either produce it always or else they would never produce it because the school asserts they are permanent things. To sometimes produce and sometimes not produce is occasional, so they would become199"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIimpermanent. This would be a fault, they say. Master Jampal Gegpay De states that because noncomposites have no essence, they are merely the object of ob­servation but are not a condition that produces result. In the Kartik, this is stated to be untenable but I do not see any great discrepancy between the po­sitions of the Great Exposition and Jampal Gegpay De. Those of you who have powers of reasoning, scrutinize this.iv. Dominant condition62d The enabling is the dominant.The enabling cause is explained as the dom inant condition. Its characteristics are not hindering the arising of the result and being suitable to be a condi­tion.Well then, if ail dharmas are both objective condition and dominant con­dition, what is the distinction between the two? you ask. Those which are con­current and coemergent are dominant conditions but not objective conditions.Well then, above it explains all dharmas as the objective condition, but here it says that the coemergent and concurrent dharmas are not the objective con­dition. Is this not contradictory? Because this is in terms of general and spe­cific, it is not contradictory.117 Therefore, the dom inant condition is all dharmas other than oneself: from the Commentary, “‘All’ is all composites ex­cept for its own essence.”b. Which conditions operate at which time. This has three points.i. The time in which the coemergent and concurrent causes operate63ab Two causes’ function is directed Toward ceasing.In terms of the causal condition, the two coemergent and concurrent causes perform their function in the present, directed toward the ceasing of the re­sult. Their function is threefold: holding the result, issuing the result, and making use of the object.ii. The time in which the same status, full ripening, and universal causes operate63b The three toward arising.200"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"CAUSES, CONDITIONS, AND RESULTSThe three universal, same status, and full ripening causes perform their func­tion in the future, directed toward the arising of the result.iii. The time in which the immediate and objective conditions operate63cd The two conditions other thanThat are the opposite of those.First, the two concurrent immediate and objective conditions that are other than that, the causal condition, are the opposite of those above as they per­form their function in the opposite order. The immediate condition performs its function at the arising that begins an action, and the objective condition is perceived by the present cognition and mental factors, so it performs its func­tion on ceasing.c. Which things arise from how many conditions. This has two topics: i. General teaching, and ii. Specific explanation of things with form.i. General teaching. This has (1) Presenting our own tradition, and (2) Re­futing other traditions.(1) Presenting our own tradition. This has three points.(a) From four conditions64a Four produce mind and mental factors,The causal condition of mind and mental factors is all five causes. The con­current immediate condition is previous mind and mental factors that have not been interrupted by another cognition. The objective condition is any one of the five objects or all dharmas. The dominant condition is all dharmas ex­cept the cognition’s own essence and dharmas that arise later. In this way, these four conditions produce m ind and mental factors.(b) From three conditions64b And three, the two absorptions.And three, the causal, immediate, and dominant conditions, produce the two absorptions of freedom from conception and cessation. As those two are not cognitions that focus, they do not arise from the objective condition. The201"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA IIcausal condition in this context is the coemergent cause of birth and so forth and the same status cause of prior dharmas of comparable level. The mind of entry into absorption and its concurrences are the immediate condition, and the dominant condition is everything different from them that is previously or presently arisen.(c) From two conditions64bc OthersArise from two,The others, the nonconcurrent formations other than the two absorptions and that which has form, arise from the two causal and dominant conditions. They do not arise from the concurrent immediate or objective conditions, be­cause they are not concurrent.(2) Refuting other traditions64cd not God and so forthSince they’re successive and so forth.Some outsiders say all beings arise from the sole cause of God Indra, the self, the Person, the primal substance, or so forth. To refute that: all beings who are born are not born from God, a soul, the primal substance, and so forth, since they are born successively, and so forth— they are born intermittently in different locations, times, and substances. Additionally, it follows that all beings would arise at the same time, because their sole cause is permanent and single.Here some say that the cause is permanent, but beings arise successively out of the power of G od’s wishes. If you say so, then it follows that the causes of beings are multiple, because the wishes that cause beings are separate and multiple.n. Specific explanation of things with form.

In Form and in Formless there are three minds each— those except for nonvirtue— for six. Two minds are undefiled: learner and nonlearner. Altogether there is a total of twelve.ii. The eight instances in which the twelve minds follow one anotherThere are known to be eight instances in which mind arises following upon another mind.1) The instance of continuation is when virtuous minds and so forth arise in a continual stream of the same type.2) The instance of comparable level is when minds of incompatible type but the same level arise following one another, such as when a nonvirtuous mind of Desire follows upon a virtuous mind and so forth of Desire.3) The instance of entering absorption is when a higher levels virtue arisen from training or either of the undefiled minds arises from a lower level’s virtue arisen from training.4) The instance of arising from absorption is when Desire’s virtue arisen ei­ther upon birth or from training, or an upper level’s virtue arisen from training only, arise immediately after a higher level’s virtue arisen from training or either of the undefiled minds.5) The instance of rebirth-linking is when a defiled mind only arises upon dying with any of the minds of the three realms. The Prince explains that this m ind of birth is in the between state.6) The instance of being troubled by the afflicted is when an upper level’s virtuous pure m ind118 becomes afflicted and one thinks, “May I arise with the virtue of a lower level.” One casts that defiled mind aside and arises with a204"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"CAUSES, CONDITIONS, AND RESULTSvirtuous mind.

The connection be­tween the chapters in terms o f meaning is that individuals who wish for lib­eration should among the four truths internalize the characteristics and character bases of the truth of suffering first. This develops weariness with the world, it is said.The actual meaning of this verse is as follows. Beings in the hells are led there by nonmeritorious causes that do not have even the slightest pleasant result and cannot find protection until extricated by the full ripening of karma. The hungry ghosts are overwhelmed by hunger and thirst. And there are the “bent-goers” or animals who bend as they go. And humans are predominantly mental. And the six types o f gods of Desire have their palaces in the sky.122 Including their environment or container, these are the Desire realm.ii.

Classifying in four by birth3b Because of birth, it has four types.Because of differences in birth, it has different four types: the sense bases of Infinite Space, Infinite Consciousness, Nothingness, and Neither Conception nor Nonconception. These absorptions are so called because of the way one trains to achieve them. First, when both the conception of form and the part of it that is perceived have disintegrated, one thinks, “Space is infinite.” From tran­scending the negation of the existence of anything perceived in mere space, there is a not-negation128 of it as a thing and one thinks, “Consciousness is in­finite.” Then one thinks, “This mere awareness cannot be proven to be any par­ticular essence.” Then one fears that conceptions are like results and pain, but the lack of conceptions is total stupidity, so one does not stop the subde, unclear movement of conceptions. During the actual absorption, one attains a result similar to those trainings, so the absorptions are therefore named after them.iii. How the continuum of mind is engaged3cd There, likeness and life force as well Support the m inds continuum.In Desire and Form, the continuum of m ind is supported by the bodily form, but what supports it here? you ask. There in the Formless realm, likeness of same status and life force as well support the m ind s continuum . “As well” means that the continuum by mind is also supported by karma, nonposses­sion, attainment, birth, and so forth.Well then, why do likeness and life force not support life in the realms of Desire and Form as well? you ask. T hat is because in those realms one is not free of the conception of form, and because life force and so forth are weak in comparison.

This is because the pleasure of this level is not stable. 4) The gods of the third dhyana are the same in having a body that is light by nature and the conception of pleasure, because the pleasure of this level is stable.

It has n ot reached its destination, the previous state with complete name-and-form and the six sense bases propelled by karma, so the between state is not born.(3) Proof. This has (a) Logical proofs, and (b) Scriptural proofs.(a) Logical proofs. This has three topics: (i) Actual proof, (ii) Teaching that the example is illogical, and (iii) Proving the reason for that.(i) Actual proof1 lab Analogous to a grains continuum,It is not born from interruption.The Buddhist Mahasamghika and Mahlsasaka schools say that the birth state only happens immediately following the state of death, so there is no between state. This is the opponent’s position.Because the form of the birth state in Desire and Form is similar to a grain of seed, from which a shoot, from which a trunk, and so forth arise in an un­interrupted continuum, it is analogous to a grains continuum and to the re­sult of that continuum. Therefore, because the essence of the continuum of existence arises in a different place, it is not born solely from the continuation of a state of death that has been interrupted. This is a result reason of a prior cause132 where the reason and the example are taught simultaneously.(ii) Teaching that the example is illogical1 led Since a reflection is not proven,Nor similar, it’s not an example.Well, one does see instances where the cause’s continuum is interrupted but the result arises. For example, the reflection of a face that appears in a mirror224"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"THE WORLD OF SENTIENT BEINGSis the result of that face, but it arises even though it is interrupted in space. For this reason, the birth state also arises from the interrupted state of death, you say.This is not so, since a reflection is not proven to be a form. The word “nor” includes the alternatives: even if a reflection were proven to be a form, because it is not similar to an actual form, it is not suitable to be given as an example.(Mi) Proving the reason for that. This has two points.A. The proof that it is not established as an obstructive form12 a O n one, no two are simultaneous.On the object of a mirror, the color of the mirror and the color of the reflection do not both arise simultaneously at one time, because on one object no two obstructive forms of similar type are able to arise simultaneously. A reflection is not an obstructive thing, but it is not logical for it to be any other type of thing either. If it were, the mirror would not be necessary as a support for the reflection. The Prince explains:Therefore, the state of birth is in the continuum of the state of death, but a reflection is not the same with re­spect to form, so the example of the reflection is not proof. The example of the essence that arises later in a grains continuum is something that has its own con­tinuum, thus it is a compatible example.B. The proof that the example and meaning are dissimilar12 b Its discontinuous, born from two.It, the reflection of a face’s form in a mirror is discontinuous from the face’s form because the reflection is connected to the continuum of the mirror and arises simultaneously as the face’s form. The reflection is born from the two principal conditions of the mirror and the face’s form, but here the state of birth is not born from two causes of the state of death and some other cause, because no principal cause other than the state of death can be observed. The primary cause of the state of birth can not be the semen, blood and so forth, because miraculous birth arises from space without any semen or blood.133225"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA III(b) Scriptural proofs12 cd Since mentioned, it exists.

We do not recite any sutra like that because it does not appear in our scriptures, you say. Well then, from the Sutra o f Entering the Womb:136From the manifestation of three situations, the child is conceived in the m others womb: a suitable mother who has a menstrual flow, the parents becoming lustful and joining, and the scent-eater also being nearby.The scent-eater mentioned here is a just synonym for the between state. Also, it is also said in the Asvalâyana Sutray “Your scent-eater who is nearby... ” We do not recite any such sutras, you say. From another sutra:The nonreturners are five: complete nirvana in the in­termediate, complete nirvana upon birth, complete nirvana without effort, complete nirvana with effort, and bound for higher.Here five nonreturners are taught. And it is proven in the Sutra o f the Seven Holy Wanderers.137 The word “and” means that in addition to the logical proofs, there are the above scriptures and many other scriptures that prove it, such as:Put dhyanas in four groups of ten,226"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"THE WORLD OF SENTIENT BEINGSThe Formless in three groups of seven,Conception in one group of six,And ail is put in categories.Well, it is said that the demon named Criticism went directly to the Incessant Hell in one instant in his own body, so there is no between state. It is also said that if you commit a heinous deed, you will be born in hell immediately. So it is said, you say. These do not mean that there is no between state, but rather that while still alive the body is surrounded by the flames of hell, and then one dies and goes to hell in the between state. The latter also means that it is karma experienced on rebirth without any other intervening existence.W ith regard to one sinful brahman:Brahman, when youth has been carried away There’s aging and sickness: the demons approach.Between there is no place for you,There are no provisions for your journey.Although this says there is no place in between, this means that between that life and the lower realms there is no place of birth in the higher realms; it does not teach that there is no between state.However, when one is born from Desire or Form into Formless, there is no between state.ii.

This has three points.(a) Actual13ab Since it is propelled by the same karma,It has the body of the next.Since it, the between state, is a corporeal sentient being propelled by the one same propelling karma as the upcoming previous state, it has the body shape and form o f the next previous state that will arise.227"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA III(b) Identifying the previous state13cd The previous is prior to deathBut onward from the m om ent of birth.Well then, what is the previous state itself? you ask. The previous state is the continuum of the five aggregates of grasping themselves prior to the state of death but onward from the m om ent of the state of birth.Therefore, among the four states, the between state and the previous state have been explained. The state of birth is the m om ent of rebirth-linking as a new being. The last m om ent of death is the state of death: it is what occurs before the between state for those who will take birth among sentient beings with form. Thus the states of birth and death are moments, and the other two states are continuums.(c) What they are seen by14a They re seen by their class, divine eye.They, the between states of hell, are seen by hell beings, and the between states of gods are seen by gods of their comparable class, and they are seen by the clairvoyance of the divine eye that is produced by meditation and free of the eleven faults. They are not seen by the extremely pure divine eye attained upon birth. The eleven faults are as follows:They’re doubt and inattention,A body that’s unworkable,And torpor, sleep, and agitation,Harsh diligence, and crooked mind,Anxiety, and various conceptions,Too talkative, harsh meditation.Some say that those in the between state of the gods can see the between states o f all five wanderers, and those in the intermediates states of humans, hungry ghosts, animals, and the hells cannot see the higher ones.(2) Distinctions of miracles14b The miracles of karma have power.They have the miracles of being able to fly in space and so forth out of the force of karma.

There are many different propositions by Venerable Dharmatrani of the Sutra school, the Sec­ond Teacher Vasubandhu, Venerable Vasumitra, the Great Exposition school, Sanghabhadra, and so forth. To summarize them with verses from my own Tika™The venerable elders of the Sutra school Say the between state has indefinite duration.If a being with provisions for one hundred years Spends a year in between, once he has eaten that years,He has only enough for some ninety-nine more In the previous state. By that logic it s known.Vasumitra says if the conditions are met,W ithin seven days. O r if not, after staying Seven days there’s migration.

The manner it goes to the mode of birth. This has three topics: i. W hat frame of m ind it enters with, ii. W hat shape it enters with, and iii. Explaining other distinctions of frame of mind.i. What frame of mind it enters with. This has three points.(1) The frame of mind in birth from the womb and egg15ab The m ind mistaken, out of lust It goes into its destination.W ith the eye that arises from the power of karma, a being in this period of the between state sees the place where he will be reborn from far off. W hen entering either of the modes of birth from womb or from egg, if the being will be male, he has lust for mother and hatred for the father, or if female, lust for the father and anger for the mother, and if neuter, he has the desire of either the male neuter or the female neuter. As the being has this particular desire, the m ind is mistaken and out of lust goes between the organs during copulation. Then it wants to sleep, so it goes amongst the semen and blood into its destination, the uterus. Once it has gone into the womb, which is like a ball of yarn, it feels affection for the semen and blood as “mine,” and it stays.(2) The frame of mind in birth from warmth15c Others from longing for a smellUnlike the two just described, in birth from warmth other beings go to a clean or unclean place from longing for a smell, according to their karma.(3) The frame of mind in miraculous birth15d O r place.230"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"THE WORLD OF SENTIENT BEINGSIn miraculous birth, they go out of longing for a place. This is entering the place of birth in a different manner than in either birth from the womb or the egg.Well then, how is that one longs for hell? Because the m ind is mistaken, one is tormented by cold rain and wind. Seeing fire in hell, one wants to get warm and rushes there. Alternatively, when suffering from and tormented by heat, one sees the cold hells as cool and rushes there. Thus is the link to the next rebirth made.The between state of the gods is like arising from a cushion and going up. Humans, animals, and hungry ghosts go according to their situations.ii.

The three— wheel wielding as well asTwo self-awakened— enter the womb Because their karma or their wisdom O r both are vast, respectively.First those who enter knowingly but stay and emerge unknowingly, and those who enter and stay knowingly but emerge unknowing, and those who are knowing in all three, are the three— respectively the wheel-wielding emperor as well as the two self-awakened individuals, self-buddhas and tathagatas— that enter the w om b knowingly. This is because their— wheel wielding emperors'— karma or merit is vast, or because of their— self-buddhas’— wis­dom from meditating for one hundred aeons is vast, or because of both of the buddhas accumulations are vast, respectively. W hen they enter the womb, they are not yet buddhas and so forth, but they are called by their future appellation.But the self-buddha both entering and staying knowingly and birth from the egg always being deluded are contradictory, because the son of King Pancala was born from an egg and was a self-buddha, you say.

The manner the aggregates alone link rebirth18. There is no self—mere aggregates.Continuum s of between states Assembled by afflictions and karma Enter the womb. It s like a lamp.According to outsiders, it follows that there is a self because sentient beings transmigrate to different worlds, you say. This does not pervade, because there is no self that accepts or rejects in the internal aggregates that make up the being.Well then, what provides continuity between the state of death and rebirth- linking? you ask. There is merely the continuum of the aggregates themselves. Labeling that continuum as the “self” is not refuted, because it is suitable to call it by any name. The aggregates alone have no power to transmigrate to new aggregates without stopping, because continuum s o f the between states that are fully ripened results and personally made results assembled by afflic­tions and karma enter the womb. It is like a lamp that is momentary but burns in a continuum of moments.2. The beginningless continuum of the aggregates19. Just as propelled, the continuumArose in stages, then from karma And afflictions goes to the next world—Beginningless wheel of existence.Just as it was propelled by ignorance and formation, the continuum arose in stages of consciousness, name-and-form, six sense bases, contact and feeling. Here death in the womb, death as a small child, and death in the prime of life are propelled by the prior accumulation of the beings own specific karma. The order it develops is described in the scriptures:233"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIIAt first its mushiness.From mushiness, the oval.From the oval comes the oblong,From the oblong comes the solid.From the solid, the hands and feet move.Hair, fur, and nails, and such;The faculties with form;And organs develop in sequence.The faculties produced by sustenance and so forth mature, and then from ac­cumulating karma and performing afflicted conduct itself the body disinte­grates. Then just as before the continuum of the between state goes to thenext world by aging and death and by birth. This is because from karma andafflictions comes birth, and from birth, too, karma and afflictions are accu­mulated, so it is a beginningless wheel o f existence.3.

Name is the four aggregates— like names, they are unobstructive. Form is the fetal stages of mushiness and so on. The link of those, the six sense bases, is the five aggregates from the time when those have completely emerged until the three of object, faculty, and con­sciousness are assembled. The link of contact is the five aggregates from then until the object, faculty, and consciousness are assembled and one knows the causes— a pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, or other object— o f pleasure and of pain, et cetera, including neutral feeling. T hen the link of feeling is the five aggregates from the time one is able to discern the causes of the three feelings until the lust for sex arises. And the link of craving is the five aggregates during the period of especial greed for the possession of desirable things and for sex before one actively seeks the object. The link of close grasping is the five ag­gregates during the period when one begins actively seeking and then chases after everything in order to obtain the enjoyments of desirable objects such as horses, cattle, grain, treasures, and so forth as well as the pleasures of sex. The five aggregates that, in chasing after things, perform actions or karmas that accumulate virtue and nonvirtue and will later produce a happy or mis­erable result of existence is the link of becoming.

This is how: that which is the delusion that kills out of the power of greed is igno­rance. T hat which is the volition is formation. Indi­vidually knowing things is consciousness. The four ag­gregates that arise simultaneously with consciousness are name-and-form. The faculties that reside within name-and-form are the six sense bases. The six sense bases coming together is contact. Experiencing contact is feeling. That which is greed is craving. The entanglers that are concurrent with that are grasping. The actions of body and speech that those motivate is becoming.The arising of those actions is birth. Their complete ripening is aging. Their disintegration is death.Thus among the four classifications of interdependence, the Bhagavan pre­sented the continuum of the five aggregates over the period of three lifetimes as the twelve links. T hey of the Great Exposition claim here in this context that this is the teaching of the links to be periodic.The word “claim” indicates that this is the Great Expositions position: it is237"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY *■ AREA IIIa skeptical word from the Sutra school, which says it is admissible to present the six sense bases and name-and-form as periods of the five aggregates, but how could ignorance and formation be a period of the five aggregates?(ii) Dispelling doubts25b The links called by the principal.If in all twelve links there are all five aggregates, why is the first link known simply as ignorance? you wonder. Because at that point ignorance is principal, the link is called by the name of the principal, like saying, “The king has come” when an army with four divisions142 arrives. In the same way, the links from formation to aging and death are known by that which is principal at that point.(d) Rebutting that this contradicts the sutras25cd Its taught to reverse ignoranceAbout the previous, next, and middle.In the abhidharma, the links of interdependence are taught with regards to both sentient beings and all other composite phenomena. In the sutras, how­ever, they are only taught with regard to sentient beings in order to reverse the doubt and ignorance about the self in the three times of the previous, next, and middle lives, such as the doubt, “Did it occur or not? Will it occur or not? W hat is it like here in the middle?”(2) Grouping them into afflictions, karma, and bases. This has three points,(i) Actual26ab Three are afflictions. Two are karma.Seven are basesO f the twelve links, three are afflictions: ignorance, craving, and grasping. O f these, ignorance is the cause of the current birth, and craving and grasping are the cause of future birth. The two links of formation and becoming are karma. These cause the present and future births. Because they are the support of karma and afflictions, seven links are bases: the five from consciousness to feeling, birth, and aging and death.238"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"THE WORLD OF SENTIENT BEINGS(ii) Teaching that seven are result26b and results.The seven branches that are the bases for karma and the afflictions are also re­sults, because the result of ignorance and formation is the five from conscious­ness to feeling, and the result of craving, grasping, and becoming is the two links of birth and aging and death.(iii) The reason for not explaining the previous and next lives in detail26cd Cause and result of two is concise:One can infer them from the middle.Well, for this lifetime the five results from consciousness to feeling and both karma and the afflictions are explained in detail, so why in the future lifetime are they condensed into the two results of birth and aging and death? W hy are they condensed in the previous lifetime into the cause ignorance only? you ask. The links of cause and result of the two past and future lives is taught concisely; the detailed explanations of the two causes in past lifetime and five results in future lifetime are not given. This is because one can infer them from the detailed explanation of cause and effect in the middle. There is no need to tire oneself pointlessly.(3) Dispelling others' doubts. This has two points.143(a) Dispelling doubts as to the quantity27. Afflictions bear afflictions, action.From that, the bases, and from those Arise the bases and afflictions.That is existence’s progression.Well, it follows that samsara has a beginning and an end, because ignorance has no cause and aging and death no result. If you agree, it follows that more links should be added, because those two need a cause and result. This would therefore become endless because of your assertion, you say.Even if those two links have causes and results, it does not follow that more links need to be added. The Bhagavan said that the affliction of craving bears the affliction of grasping, and afflictions bear the karma of action itself: for­mation arises out of ignorance, and becoming arises out of grasping. From that karma of formation and becoming, the bases of consciousness and birth239"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IIIarise. From those arise the bases from name-and-form to feeling and aging and death, and from these bases of feeling and aging and death, the afflictions of ignorance, craving, and grasping arise. This is how the links of existence progress.(b) The distinction between arising and arisen28ab Here what is arising is a cause;W hat has arisen is a result.Here in this presentation from the sutras, w hat is arising in interdependence is a link that is a cause, because something arises from it. W hat has arisen in interdependence is proposed as a link that abides, because it has arisen. There­fore all of the links are proven to be both arising and arisen, because they are both a cause and a result. Although this is so, cause and result do not get mixed up, because when they arise depending on something else, that some­thing does not depend upon them. For instance, in relation to ones own fa­ther, one is the child and not the father.b. The essence of each link. This has two topics: i. Actually explaining four links, and ii. Teaching that the other links are known from elsewhere.i. Actually explaining four links. This has four topics: (1) An explanation of ignorance, (2) O f name, (3) O f contact, and (4) O f feeling.(1) An explanation of ignorance. This has two topics: (a) Identifying its essence, and (b) Dispelling wrong conceptions.(a) Identifying its essence28cd An other dharma, opposite to knowing,Ignorance is like untruth, unfriendly, et cetera.The meaning of ignorance: ignorance is an other dharm a that is an unclear mental factor and is opposite to correct knowing of truth, karma and result, the jewels, and so on. As nonthings and matter are also the absence of knowl­edge or something that is not knowledge, ignorance is not merely either of those two. For example, it is like untruth, which is understood as a lie, u n ­friendly as enemies, nondharma as nonvirtue, “not its meaning” as “the in­correct meaning,” wrong action144 as unmindful action, et cetera.240"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"THE WORLD OF SENTIENT BEINGSWell then, from what do we know that ignorance is not merely the absence of knowing? you ask. It says in a sutra, “Through the condition of ignorance, formation arises.”145 It is also logically proven because the eye and so forth, which are not knowing, are not the condition for formations, and rabbits’ horns and such, which are the nonexistence of awareness, also do not function as the causes for formations.146(b) Dispelling wrong conceptions. This has two points.(1) Refuting that ignorance is a mere absence because it is a name for an affliction.29a Because of fetter and such words.Ignorance is not presented as merely the absence of knowing or not knowing, because in teaching fetter and such words as the three bonds, four floods, and four yokes, it is taught as a separate mental factor.(ii) Refuting calling bad full knowing \"ignorance\"2 9 b -d N ot bad full knowing, since that is view.Since it’s concurrent with that view;It’s taught that it afflicts full knowing.If that is so, then like saying a bad child is not your child, bad full knowing is ignorance, you say. Ignorance is not such bad full knowing, since that is an afflicted view. In that case, afflicted bad full knowing that is not a view is ig­norance, you say. T hat is also not so, since it, ignorance, is concurrent with that view, and because views are full knowing, and it is never possible for two substances of full knowing to be concurrent with each other. Additionally, bad full knowing is not ignorance, because it is taught that ignorance afflicts full knowing, making it afflicted.(2) An explanation of name30a Skandhas that are not form are name.The four skandhas or aggregates that are not form— feeling and so forth— are nam e in the link name-and-form because they engage their object by power of names, and because they are unobstructive, like names.241"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA III(3) An explanation of contact30b—d Six contacts happen from assembly.Five are obstructive contact, and The sixth is designated contact.31. Aware and unaware and other contactAre stainless and afflicted and the rest.Malicious, lustful contact, andThree felt as pleasant and so forth.The six contacts from eye to m ind happen from assembly, because they arise from the assembly of object, faculty, and consciousness coming together.Well then, the first five faculties and consciousness arise simultaneously, so they meet by assembly, but in contact assembled by mind it is not definite that all three will be assembled, because it is not logical that the mind faculty that has ceased, future dharmas that have not arisen, and the present mind consciousness could be assembled simultaneously, you say. This does not per­vade, because the assembly of cause and result is called an assembly, even though they are not necessarily simultaneous. Alternatively, the single result itself has the meaning of assembly, because result is compatible with the pro­duction of a single contact. The many divergent opinions of earlier masters about contact appear in the Great Tika, so refer there.O f these contacts, the first five are obstructive contact, because they are contact that arises based upon obstructive faculties that have form. And the sixth is called designated contact because one meaning may be labeled with many names, so names are designations, and this is the contact that focuses on those. The eye consciousness knows blue, but does not know to think, “This is blue,” whereas the m ind consciousness does know to think, “This is blue”— it knows what the name of a given meaning is.Also, these six can become three: aware contact, and unaware or ignorant contact, and other contact that is neither of those two. The first two are re­spectively stainless, undefiled contact and afflicted contact, because the aware mentioned here is undefiled full knowing, and ignorance in this context is afflicted full knowing, and these contacts are concurrent with those. The third is the rest other than those two: it is put forth as contact concurrent with vir­tuous defiled or unobscured neutral full knowing, because it is contact that is not concurrent with either of the two above full knowings. W ithin ignorant contact, malicious and lustful contact, which are labeled by the names of their companions, are especially harmful, so they are taught separately.Alternatively, all contact can be included within the three categories of con­242"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"THE WORLD OF SENTIENT BEINGStact felt or experienced as pleasant and so forth, including contact experienced as unpleasant and contact experienced as neutral, because they are the com­patible causes of the experiences of pleasure and so forth. In this way, there are sixteen types of contact.(4) An explanation of feeling. This has two topics: (a) General classification, and (b) A specific explanation of mental feeling.(a) General classification32ab From that, six feelings can arise:Five bodily, the other mental.From that contact, there are six feelings that can arise: feeling that arises from contact assembled by eye and so on. O f these, because the first five de­pend upon faculties with form, they are bodily feeling. T he mental feeling is other than those five; it is feeling that arises from contact assembled by mind.Does feeling arise after contact or together with it? you ask. Some Great Expositionists say they are together, because they are m utual coemergent causes. The Sutra school asks, if they arise simultaneously, how can the pro­ducer be proven to produce the thing that is produced? In response, the Great Exposition asks in return, why it would not be proven? T he Sutra school replies that two coemergent dharmas cannot be proven to be producer and produced because after a dharma has arisen, there is no power to produce it again. There are many other such debates between the Exposition and Sutra schools which can be found in the great Tika itself.(b) A specific explanation of mental feeling.

This has three points.i. Teaching the all-afflicted afflictions through comparisons36b-d In this, afflictions are like seeds,Like nagas, and like roots and trees,Like husks as well, it is proposed.In this discussion, the afflictions are like seeds: just as trunks, branches, and leaves grow from seeds, afflictions, karma, and the bases grow out of the afflic­tions. They are like nagas: just as a lake will not dry up if there is a naga in it, the lake of birth will not dry up if there is the naga of afflictions. And they are like the roots of a thicket: just as if you do not pull those out, it will re-grow even if you cut off the branches, if you do not pull the afflictions out from the root, wanderers will be reborn. And they are like trees: just as trees produce flowers and fruit in season, afflictions are the cause of afflictions, karma, and the bases. They are like the thick husks of rice grains, as well, it is proposed: if there are husks, the grains produce a crop but without them do not. Simi­larly karma that has the husk of the attainment of afflictions leads to rebirth in the next lives, but without that, karma alone does not.ii. Teaching the all-afflicted karma through comparisons37ab Karma’s like rice within its husk,Like medicine and flowers.247"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA IIIKarma is like rice w ithin its husk, because just as if there is a husk, the germ of a rice grain produces a fruit, karma that has the husk attained through the afflictions produces the result of birth. Like medicine that gives its power a single time, karma also produces a single fully ripened result, and does not produce any more. And like flowers that are the proximate cause for the arising of fruit, karma is the proximate cause of full ripening, and the afflictions are the distant cause.in. Teaching the all-afflicted bases through a comparison37 bc The bases,Like food and drink that have been got.T he bases are like food and drink that have been got. For example, once food and drink has been obtained, it is no more than something to enjoy; it is not something that needs to be produced again. Similarly, the fully ripened bases also are merely something to enjoy and not to produce in other lifetimes, be­cause after fully ripening they have no connection to other full ripening in other lifetimes.d.

However, it is not afflicted by five autonomous entanglers: jealousy, stinginess, regret, aggression, and concealment.147 The three states that are other than the state of rebirth, the between state, previous state, and state of death, are three­fold— virtue, afflicted, and neutral.

The other two are sustenance of volition, which has the purpose to propel the next life, and the sustenance of consciousness, which has the purpose to actually establish the next life once it has been propelled. Thus they are pre­sented in this order. In this way, the first two are like a wet nurse who takes care of someone after birth, and the latter two are like a mother who gives birth to someone who has not yet been born.A few words here:The wonderful acuity that purifies rebirthIs not begrimed with filth from creatures of degenerate times.W ithin this feast of explanations for those wanting freedom,There is a great gate to inexhaustible nectar.D.

The mention of birth also includes rebirth-linking in the between state.b. Specific explanations. This has three points.1. Distinctions of feeling42d At death and birth, there’s neutral feeling.At death and at birth there is neutral feeling only, because pleasure and suf­fering are clear, but a clear consciousness is unsuitable for death or birth.ii. Distinctions of mind43a N ot in one-pointed or no mind.Those who were born in the Desire realm do not die or take birth while they are resting in one-pointed equipoise or in a state with no mind. This is because death and birth are not the same status as samadhi, because samadhi arises from effort and is beneficial, and because those who are in states with no mind cannot be harmed by fire, weapons, or so forth.iii. The manner of entering the state without remainder43b Nirvana in two neutral minds.The m ind of the state of death is explained to be virtuous, nonvirtuous, or neutral. O f these, an arhat passes into nirvana in one of two neutral minds. If one proposes that there is fully ripened neutral feeling in Desire, then it is either that of the path of conduct or full ripened. If one proposes there is not, it is either a virtuous mind of a path of conduct or an unafflicted neutral mind, it is said. In particular, those two are weak, which makes them consistent with severing the continuum of mind, whereas other minds are strong.2.

Some say that arhats exit through the crown o f their heads. If one dies instantaneously, the body faculty stops in an instant along with the mind.3. The cause of severing the pith44b Water, et cetera, severs the pith.In some of these instances, the duhkha said to be of the pith being severed arises. The pith is that part of the body which harming will cause death. Sev­ering is an intolerable feeling arising there. In cases when there is a lot of phlegm, this is caused by the element of water being disturbed. Included by the phrase “et cetera,” when there is a lot of bile, the element of fire is dis­turbed, and if there is a lot of wind, the element of wind is violently disturbed. It is not severed by the other source, earth: this is similar to the destruction of the environment, the world.148These three are all in terms of gradual death. In the instantaneous death of those born by miraculous birth, the faculties are not discarded through a single part of the body, nor is the pith severed. The gods of Desire do not have their pith severed, but when the five near signs and five distant signs of death appear, they experience unfathomable suffering.E. Categorizing beings in three groups44cd Nobles are destined for the correct;The heinous deeds for the mistaken.From a sutra:Three groups of sentient beings are recognized: the group that is destined for the correct, the group des­tined for the mistaken, and the uncertain group.O f these three groups that are taught, nobles are destined for the correct be­cause they are certain to be born in the higher realms and not the lower, and then attain freedom, and those who have done the heinous misdeeds are des­tined for the mistaken, because immediately after dying they are certain to be reborn in hell.

If you classify it, there are two types: volitional karma and w hat that volition creates, intended karma. This is because it is said in the sutras, “Karma is twofold: volitional and intended karma.” Intended karma is also classified in two, so there are three types.2. Their individual essencesled Volition is mental karma, whichCreates the karma of body and speech.O f those three, the mental factor volition is the m ental karma.

Perceptible. This has two points: i. Perceptible of body, and ii. Perceptible of speech.i. Perceptible of body. This has three points.(1) Identifying its essence according to the Great Exposition tradition2 b Bodily perceptible is shape.W hen the m ind thinks, “I will prostrate,” bodily perceptible action, such as prostrating and joining one s palms, is proposed to be shape.(2) Refuting the doubts of the VatsiputrTya school2cd It is not movement, since composites Are momentary, as they perish.3ab Nothing can happen without cause.The cause would become the destroyer.Followers of the Vatsiputrlya school agree that some composites such as rain­storms or flames are momentary but mostly do not assert momentary imper­manence. Therefore perceptible actions of body are not impermanent because they are actions that move the body from one location to another. They are not unmoving actions, they say.This is illogical. It, karma or action of the body, is not movement to another location without ceasing since it is composite, like cognition and so forth. To prove that this is pervasively true, all composites are without a doubt m om en­tary phenomena that are destroyed immediately upon arising, as without a doubt they immediately perish independent of other causes or conditions. The disintegration of composites does not depend upon some other cause be­cause nothing that depends upon a cause can happen w ithout a cause, but lightning and so on are directly seen to perish without any cause at all.In that case, some things such as lightning are like that, but we can see that hammers and such are the cause of the destruction of clay jugs and so forth, you say. If that were so, the cause of the red color of a clay jug that is heated, fire, would become the destroyer of the red color of the heated jug: it would follow that the creator was also the destroyer.295"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IV(3) The tradition of the Sutra school3 c Two would perceive it; not in particles.The Sutra school holds that shape does not exist substantially, because when it is destroyed, there is no m ind that perceives it, just as with a vase. If shape were to exist, the two faculties of body and eye would both perceive it, because the eye would see shape directly and know it, and also when the body faculty touches it, a cognition that thinks “long” or so forth would occur. One cannot agree, because then it would be senseless to have multiple faculties, and the correspondence between the sense bases and substances would be weakened.Any existing obstructive form at all must exist in the atoms that are aggre­gated. Long and other such shapes do not substantially exist, because there is not any such thing in the particles, because atoms have no parts.At this point, there are many arguments and counter-arguments between the Great Exposition and Sutra schools, but I shall not go into them here.ii. Perceptible of speech3d Perceptible speech is speech’s sound.The perceptible karma of speech is speech’s sound— sound that has the nature of speech— because it makes the desire that motivates the speaker to talk per­ceptible to others.b. Imperceptible forms. This has two topics: i. Proof they exist substantially, and ii. Presentation of their features.i. Proof they exist substantially4ab Three kinds and stainless form are taught;Increase; and paths not done; et cetera.The Sutra school says that imperceptible forms do not substantially exist. This is because they are merely promises not to do something any more from this time forward until forfeited which are merely given the label imperceptible form; because they are designated based upon the past sources, but the past sources do not exist in essence; and because they do not fulfill the character­istics of form.The Great Exposition school says that imperceptible forms exist substan­tially. As proof of this, a sutra says:29 6"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"THE PRESENTATION OF KARMAThe three types of form include all forms. There is form that is showable and obstructive. There is also form that is not showable but is obstructive. There is also form that is neither showable nor obstructive.Thus imperceptible forms exist because three kinds of form are taught. A sutra also says:These forms for which greed or anger do not arise are called undefiled dharmas.Thus it is also proven because stainless form is taught, and without imper­ceptible forms it would not be logical for there to be such forms.If it is one of the seven material merits or the seven immaterial merits, the merit increases greatly.171 The seven material merits are:To give a monastery or a temple,A bed, or sustenance continuously,A passing guest, or nursing for the sick O r generosity in times of darkness:These are the seven material merits.The seven immaterial merits are:To hear he172 dwells or plans to come or else Has embarked upon the road, arrived; to see him,To hear the Dharma, hold the basic precepts:If these should make true faith and joy arise,These are the seven immaterial merits.Additionally, it would follow that the karmic paths not done by oneself but that one incites others to do would not exist because there is no imperceptible form. The phrase “et cetera” means that imperceptible forms exist also because it is taught that there is form in the sense base of dharmas, because the eight­fold noble path is taught, and because it is taught that vows obstruct immoral­ity like a dike and water. There are many additional proofs, so imperceptible form is proven to exist.At this point, there are many refutations, presentations, and positions from others, including the Yogic Action, Sutra school, Dàrstàntika, earlier masters, the venerable elders of the Great Exposition, the Master, and so forth.

For that reason they are not suitable as the motivation for perceptible karma.in. The individual classification of the three dharmas. This has three topics: (1) The classification of virtue, (2 ) of nonvirtue, and (3) of neutral.(1) The classification of virtue. This has four points.(a) Ultimate virtue8c Ultimate virtue is liberation;W hat is called ultim ate virtue is the liberation of nirvana, because it is both exalted and truly virtuous. T hat is because it is the supreme happiness that is free of suffering, like freedom from illness, for example.(b) Inherent virtue8d Inherent: roots, shame, modesty;Inherent or intrinsic virtue is the three virtuous roots of nongreed, nonhatred, and nondelusion; shame; and modesty, because they do not depend upon concurrence or motivation, like beneficial medicine, for example.(c) Concurrent virtue9 a Concurrent with that is concurrent;Dharmas that are concurrent w ith that, inherent virtue, are concurrent virtue,301"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IVbecause there are no virtues in a mind that is not concurrent with the roots of virtue, like drink that is mixed with medicine.(d) Virtue of motivation9b Actions and such are motivated.The actions or karmas of body and speech motivated by those and such things, including birth, attainment, cessation, the absorption of the conception-free are motivated virtue, like the milk from a mother who has drunk a beverage mixed with beneficial medicine.(2) The classification of nonvirtue9 c Nonvirtue is the opposite.Nonvirtue, which also has four types, is the opposite of the four virtues. All that is in the end samsaric is ultimate nonvirtue. The three nonvirtuous roots, shamelessness, and immodesty are inherent nonvirtue. Dharmas that are concurrent with those are concurrent nonvirtue. T he karmas o f body and speech that these motivate, as well as the characteristics of birth and so forth and the attainm ent of nonvirtue, are motivated nonvirtue. An example to il­lustrate this would be milk from a mother who has drunk a beverage mixed with harmful drugs.(3) The classification of neutral9 d The stable is the ultimate neutral.T hat which is stable is the ultim ate neutral: space and nonanalytic cessa­tion among the noncomposites. The inherent neutral is that which is obscured by personality and extreme view in the Desire realm and by all afflictions in the higher realms. The concurrent neutral is that which is concurrent with the m ind of crafts, et cetera. Motivated neutral is the perceptibles of body and speech in the path of conduct and so forth, birth and so forth, and attainment.b. Explaining motivation in detail. This has three topics: i.

Classification of motivation1 Oab Two motivations are the causalAnd the contemporaneous motives.Well then, if the cognition of a discard of seeing cannot motivate a perceptible, then it contradicts the sutra that says, “From that wrong view come wrong thought, wrong speech, and extreme actions,” you say.It is not a contradiction. In general, there are two types o f m otiva­tions, which are called the causal and the contemporaneous (with the action) motivations.n. The nature of each classificationlOcd The first one is the instigator;The second is the executor.The first one of the two motivations is the instigator because it is both cause and motivation and because it impels the karma. T he second one, the con­temporaneous motive, is the executor because one engages in action according to it at the time of the action. W ithout the contemporaneous motivation, there might be the causal motivation, but the action will not be brought to a perceptible end. For example, it is like someone who resolves to go to the mar­ket but dies in the interim and does not reach the market.iii. Examining the four possibilities of their dharma bases.

For example, the vows of individual liberation have a mental factor of virtuous intention as their causal motivation. For the contemporaneous motivation at the time of the ceremony, however, either the continuation of that intention, hatred, or the mind of the path of activities176 might be manifest, so the attainment of the vow could be any one of these.(b) Specific12 c The Sages are alike or virtuous.T he Sage s instigator and executor are alike because his virtue engages out of virtue and neutral engages out of neutral.

The vows of fasting can be held by the sex­less and neuters as well as males and females, so the male and female fasting vows are not counted separately.B. Combining in four in terms of substancel4bc But they are four in substance since Name alone changes with the organ.The vows are eight in terms of name, but they are four in substance: the bhik­shu vows, novice vows, fasting vows, and pursuer of virtue vows. The reason for this is since just the name alone changes to bhikshuni w ith the change of sexual organs of a bhikshu.178 As there is no cancellation, attainment, or shift in the essence of the vows, they are proven to be the same continuum as before.C. How they relatel4 d They’re separate but not exclusive.W hen a single individual has all three vows, they are definitely, solely separate in their characteristics because otherwise, if one should forfeit the bhikshu vows, one would also forfeit the other two, which is not the case.In that case, because they abandon the same class but are substantially sep-30 6"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"THE PRESENTATION OF KARMAarate, they should be simultaneously exclusive179 in the stream of a single being, you say.

And they are also called the actual path of action, because they are not the aftermath but part of the actual basis.181The perceptibles and imperceptibles of the second moment are similar to individual liberation and are born from individual liberation, so they are called a vow of individual liberation only. However, they are not actually individual liberation, because one has already been liberated by the first m om ent alone.D. The individuals who possess them17a The eight have pratimoksa vows.T he eight individuals from bhikshu to faster have pratim oksa vows of indi­vidual liberation.(b) The explanation of the undefiled vows and vows of dhyana.

In the preparations182 as well there are vows of dhyana and undefiled vows, so the preparations are also taught as dhyanas, just as when we say, “There is a rice field in this town,” the area surrounding a town is called the town.T he nobles, individuals who are learners and nonlearners, have the u n ­defiled vows.(2) Teaching how they follow the mind17d The latter two follow the mind.During the discussion of the coemergent cause, it was mentioned that the two vows follow the mind. O f these three vows, the latter two, vows of dhyana and undefiled vows, follow the m ind.183 The vows of individual liberation do not follow the m ind because they follow one even when one has a different cognition or is in a mind-free state such as the absorption of cessation.308"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"THE PRESENTATION OF KARMA(3) Teaching how they are vows that discard18ab The two, on N ot Unable s pathsO f no obstacles, are called discarding.The two, vows of dhyana and undefiled vows, if supported on the level of N ot Unable,184 and produced as the essence of the path of no obstacles, discard immorality and the afflictions that motivate it, so they are called discarding vows. Therefore there are four possibilities between dhyana or undefiled vows and discarding vows.(c) Additional points18cd Mindfulness and awareness areRestraint of m ind and faculties.The sutras say:Restraint of body is excellent.Restraint of speech is excellent.Restraint of m ind is excellent.Restraint in all is excellent.They also say, “Whoever binds the faculty of the eye abides by a vow.” W hat is the nature of the vows or restraint of the mind and faculties explained there? you ask.

Noble individuals, at the time of the first undefiled moment, do not possess the past undefiled vow, since it has not previously arisen. This is because the vow has never arisen before the dharma forbearance of knowing suffering, so the past imperceptible cannot have been possessed. Those who abide in the equipoise of the worldly paths and possess the vows of dhyana and those in the equipoise of the noble path who possess undefiled vows have the present imperceptible, so they have all three times.310"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"THE PRESENTATION OF KARMA(¡¡¡) How mid-vows are possessed.

The second possibility is when a noble individual’s per­ceptible from their previous lifetime has been canceled and yet their percep­tible for this life still is unborn; that noble has no perceptible but does have the imperceptible.185 The third possibility is such as when someone who has vows prostrates.

The novice monk, novice nun, and male and female pursuer of virtue vows are at­tained from an individual. The phrase “et cetera” is mentioned in order to in­clude the ten ways the Great Exposition vinaya says the bhikshu vows may be taken. The ten ways the vows are taken are taught in the autocommentary:(i) The buddhas and self-buddhas take bhikshu vows spontaneously. (2) The five supports, by developing certainty.186 ( 3) Ajnata and the others, by being sum­moned, “Bhikshu, come hither.” (4) Mahakashyapa, by accepting the Buddha as Teacher.

(9)People in central lands, by an assembly of ten. (10 )The assembly of the good group of sixty took bhikshu vows by repeating three times that they go for refuge.At this point, the glorious Shakya Chokden explains that the Buddha taking vows spontaneously refers to him renouncing his household and so forth, but this is an imaginary fabrication.

The Sutra school says there is no harm in fasting vows lasting for many days. The Master explains there is no logical problem with fasting vows lasting many days, but fasting vows are taken for a single day only because that is how it was established by the Buddha. The modern tradition of taking fasting vows for every m onth, where one takes a vow today, for example, and maintains it on the eighth or some other day of every lunar month, is said to be Lord Atishas tradition.Some scholars say that this is illogical. If one were to take fasting vows for one particular day of every month, would such a vow arise or not? In the first instance, one would have to maintain the fasting vow continually from that day on. In the second instance, there would be no possibility of m aintain­ing the vows on the eighth day or full moon of the subsequent months, so they say.Well then, it follows that one can take the eight precepts of fasting for the rest of one’s life, because you have explained that the individual who swears to uphold the eight precepts of fasting for the rest of his life is a righteous pur­suer of virtue.189 You cannot deny the proof, and the pervasion holds. If you agree, it contradicts your position that the fasting vows cannot last longer than one day and night.O ur own position is that when one promises to maintain the fasting vows on the full moon or eighth day of the following lunar months, the vow arises out of the power of resolve in the mind. Extensive proofs and rebuttals of this appear in the great Tika.b. Ascertaining the time period o f wrong vows27cd There is no one-day-long wrong-vow,Because there’s no such oath, it’s heard.There is no one-day-long wrong vow. W hat is the reason? you ask.

While kneeling low with no adornments,Recite the words. Till morrows morn O ne swears before another at dawn To all the precepts of the fast.How does one swear to the day-long fast? It is taken while the person who is taking the vow is kneeling on one or both knees with their palms joined lower than the preceptor. One should adorn oneself w ith no new adornments. One recites the words, repeating after the preceptor. The period for which the vow is taken is until the sun rises on the morrow or next day s morn, one complete day and night. The time when one commits is when one swears before an­other at dawn before eating any food to all the precepts of the fast.//. Establishing the quantity of precepts. This has two points.(1) Actual29a—c There are four, one, and three precepts O f discipline, and carefulness,Austerity respectively.There are four root precepts, one precept of abandoning alcohol, and the last three precepts. These are the precepts of discipline, which abandon the in­herently unwholesome; and the precept of carefulness, remaining in m ind­fulness; and the precepts o f austerity, which are compatible with those precepts, respectively.(2) Dispelling doubt29d Those bring unmindfulness and arrogance.Those, drinking alcohol and eating food after noon, respectively bring u n ­mindfulness of what to do and what not to do and weaken the mindfulness of the fast.

Specifics of the five lay precepts. This has five topics: i. Explaining the meaning of a quotation from a sutra, ii. Rebutting that it is contradictory of the sutras, iii. Distinctions between lesser and greater vows, iv. Explaining the sources of refuge, and v. Specifics of the precepts./. Explaining the meaning of a quotation from a sutra30cd By promising to pursue virtueThe vow is made, its taught, like bhikshus.From the Mahdndman Sutra:190Mahanaman, thus if a householder dressed in white clothes who possesses the male faculty of a man goes for refuge in the Buddha and goes for refuge to the Dharma and Sangha, and then also says the words,“Accept me as a pursuer of virtue,” by that alone he becomes a pursuer of virtue.Can one become a pursuer of virtue who holds the lay precepts merely by going for refuge? you ask. The Aparantakas say one can. The Kashmiris say that alone does not make one a pursuer of virtue, but by promising after going for refuge, “Accept me as a pursuer of virtue for the rest of my life,” the vow is made and arises— one becomes a pursuer of virtue.Well then, reciting the liturgy “Just as the noble Arhats... ”191 then become meaningless, you say. It does not, because it is taught not as a way to attain something that has not yet been attained but as a way to know what limits have been attained and must be upheld. For example, it is like reciting the precepts of a bhikshu or a novice after attaining the vows.ii. Rebutting that it is contradictory of the sutras31a—c If that is so and all is thus bound,How is there single conduct, et cetera?Hold that, and it is held, it’s heard.317"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY i* AREA IVIf that is so and all five precepts of a pursuer of virtue are thus bound, how is it that the Buddha spoke of four types of pursuers of virtue: those who aban­don taking life alone as single conduct, et cetera, including those who hold two precepts as partial conduct, those who hold three or four as majority con­duct, and those who hold all five as complete pursuers of virtue?In response, the Great Exposition says that the intent of this is that at first all of these attain all five precepts completely. Later one violates some precepts, but one holds that, another of the precepts, without violation. And that is how it, single conduct or any of the others, is held, it is heard.///. Distinctions between lesser and greater vows3 Id They’re weak, et cetera, like the mind.The cause for them, vows, being weak, et cetera, middling and strong, is that although there are differences in how many precepts are held, one’s motivation is primary, so the vow is stronger or weaker, like the stronger or weaker faith in one’s mind.iv. Explaining the sources of refuge32. All those who go for refuge toThe three, take refuge in the dharmas That make the Buddha and the Sangha—No learning and both— and nirvana.W hat are the Three Jewels to which we go for refuge? you ask. All those who go for refuge to the Three Jewels, take refuge in the Buddha: they go for refuge in the dharmas th at make the Buddha, the truth of the path of no more learning. And going for refuge in the Sangha is going for refuge in the dharmas that make the Sangha, the truth of the path of no learning and learn­ing both. A nd going for refuge to the Dharm a is going for refuge in the dharma that makes the jewel of the Dharma, nirvana, which is the cessation of all afflictions and suffering without exception.The Great Exposition proposes that the dharma body alone is the Buddha who is the source of refuge, and the form body is not the Buddha. Likewise, the Sangha that is the source of refuge is the truth of the path only, while the Sangha that is its support is not the Sangha that is a source of refuge. The Sutra school proposes that both the support of the form body and the dharma body it supports are the Buddha who is the source of refuge, and both the318"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"THE PRESENTATION OF KARMAsupport of the Sangha and the truth of the path it supports are the Sangha that is the source of refuge.v; Specifics of the precepts. This has three topics: (1) The meaning of pre­senting sexual misconduct as a precept, (2 ) The meaning of presenting lying as a precept, and (3) The meaning of presenting intoxicants as a precept.(1) The meaning of presenting sexual misconduct as a precept This has two points.(a) Actual3 3 ab Since sexual misconduct is reviled,Since easy, since abstention is attained.In all the other vows, abandoning sexual activity in its entirety is presented as a precept. W hy in the lay precepts is abandoning sexual misconduct presented as a precept? you ask. The reason for this is since lustful sexual misconduct dishonors another’s spouse, because it is on its own a cause for rebirth in the lower realms, because it is utterly reviled in the world, and because not all sex­ual activity is like that. It is also since it is easy for householders to vow to abandon lustful misconduct, whereas abandoning sexual activity is difficult because of habituation from beginningless time. In addition, it is since ab­stention from lustful misconduct in other lifetimes as well is a vow that the nobles have attained.(b) Dispelling a doubt33cd The vow’s attained just as it’s sworn;It is not total celibacy.If a pursuer of virtue should subsequently take a bride, that alone does not vi­olate his vow. The vow is attained just as it is sworn, so one promises not to commit sexual misconduct. It is not saying, “I will not act out of desire and will practice total celibacy.”(2) The meaning of presenting lying as a precept34ab If one transgresses any precept,He would end up by telling a lie.319"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA IVW hy is lying presented as a precept? you ask. It is because if someone should transgress any precept, when asked about it they might possibly say, “I did not do that.” He would possibly end up by telling a lie on top of their previous violation. Abandoning lying is presented as a lay precept in order to prevent that.(3) The meaning of presenting intoxicants as a precept34cd O f the prohibited unwholesome,Intoxicants, as one will hold the others.O f the prohibited unwholesome acts,192 why is only abandoning intoxicants presented as a precept? you ask. The reason is that if one abandons drinking intoxicating beverages, one will hold the other precepts.(ii) What vows are attained in relation to. This has two topics: A. Individual explanations, and B. Combined explanation.A. Individual explanations. This has two points.7. Where the vows of individual liberation are attained from35ab The vows of Desire must be attainedIn relation to all, both, and present.W hen one attains any one of the vows of individual liberation, dhyana, or un­defiled from one basis,193 does one also attain the remaining from that basis? you ask. No. T he vows of individual liberation of Desire m ust be attained in relation to all three aspects of karma: the preparation, the actual act, and the aftermath. They are attained in relation to both inherently unwholesome acts and prohibited unwholesome acts, and in relation to both that which indicates and does not indicate sentient beings. And because they engage the m inds support, they are attained in relation to the present aggregates, sense bases, and elements. They are not attained from the future or past because these are not counted as sentient beings.2.

Combined explanation36ab Vows in relation to all beings;Distinctions in branches and cause.Are these vows attained in relation to all sentient beings, precepts and cause, or are they attained in relation to specific ones? The vows are attained in rela­tion to all sentient beings, but there are divisions in branches and cause. The bhikshu vows are attained from all seven branches, and the lesser vows from four.194 If you propose the three virtuous roots as a cause, the three arise to­gether, and if you propose greater, middling, and lesser volition as cause, they do not arise together, so there is division. They are attained if one is free of the five qualifications.195(b) How wrong vows are attained. This has two points.(i) Where they are attained from36cd Wrong vows are gained in relation to All and all branches; not to causes.W rong vows are attained in relation to all sentient beings and all the branches of karmic paths. Because it is impossible to have all three roots of nonvirtue simultaneously, they are not attained in relation to all causes, the Great Ex­position proposes.The Master explains that vows have the intention to help all sentient beings, so it is logical to attain vows with regard to all sentient beings, but butchers and so forth do not have wrong intentions with regards to their parents, so how could they attain their wrong vows in relation to all sentient beings? He considers that illogical.(¡¡) How they are attained37 ab Wrong vows can be attained from action,O r else they’re gained through a commitment.321"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IVW rong vows can be attained from being born in a particular caste and begin­ning the preparations for the action of killing and so forth, or else they are gained through a com m itment: “I will pursue this for my livelihood.”(c) How mid-vows are attained3 7 cd The other impercept is gainedFrom field, commitment, and respect.After vows and wrong vows, the other virtuous or nonvirtuous imperceptible o f a mid-vow is gained from the field, such as with the seven material merits o f offering a monastery and so forth.196 It can also be attained by making promises and com m itm ents such as, “I will not eat until I have prostrated to the Buddha” or “I will donate food for one m onth or half a m onth,” or from the opposite of such commitments. And it is gained from paying respect. The imperceptible of the mid-vow is attained through a strong afflicted or sincere intent.(3) Causes that cancel them.

The individual liberationIs canceled by returning vows,O r dying, or two organs arising,Severing the roots, or passing the night.W ith the exception of fasts, the vows o f individual liberation are canceled by going in front o f a cognizant person and resolutely returning vows be­cause this produces a perceptible that is exclusive o f the previous complete com m itment.

O r they are canceled by the two male and female sexual organs arising simultaneously because that weakens the male or female body that was the support for taking the vows. They are also canceled by severing the roots of virtue completely because the basis o f the vows, the roots o f virtue, have been severed.The fasting vows are canceled by those causes or by the passing of the night because they had only been resolved for a single day and night. These five are the causes that cancel the taming of individual liberation.The vows of individual liberation are called taming because they make the faculties tame.In the Vinaya, the sexual organs changing three times, and the person taking the vow not being twenty and knowing that he is not twenty, are explained as causes of cancellation.B. Presenting different proposals. This has three points.1. Proposing the root downfalls as a cause of cancellation3 9 a Some say it’s canceled by the downfalls;Some say if it, either the bhikshu or novice vow, is canceled by any one of the four root downfalls happening.2. Proposing the disappearance of dharma as a cause of cancellation39b By the True Dharmas decline, say others.The vows are canceled by the True D harm as decline because there would be no posadha197 or similar rituals, say the others, the red-robed Dharmaguptas3. The Kashmiri proposal that root downfalls do not cause cancellation39cd Kashmiris propose that when it happens,There are both, like having debts and riches.The Kashmiris propose that when it, one of the root downfalls, happens, it is like a person who has debts and also has riches, for example. Similarly, whichever root downfall has happened is canceled and broken, but the other ones remain unviolated, so there are both immorality and maintained disci­pline. This is because otherwise when you take one you would take all, they say.

Actual40ab The virtue of dhyana can be canceled By shifting level or regressing.All of the virtue of dhyana can be canceled by shifting one’s level by both shifting from a lower to a higher level, which cancels the virtue of the lower level, and by shifting from a higher to a lower level, which cancels the virtue of the higher level. O r it can also be canceled by regressing from absorption. It is possible that the virtue of the preparations for both dhyana and the un­defiled can be canceled by death, it is explained.B.

It is also canceled by the cessation of the object: stupas, monasteries, temples, beds, seats, snares, traps, weapons, and poison.199 It is canceled by the cessation of life. It is also canceled by the roots of virtue ceasing or being severed.

Even those who are not stably detached from Desire and the Peak of Existence do not perform any karma experienced on birth or in other lifetimes because when they regress from those, they regress from either the result of a nonreturner or arhat, and if one regresses from those results, it is impossible to die without first restoring them.205333"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IV(2) How many propulsions there are in the between state.

Virtuous karma that is free of Considering will fully ripen Only as feelings in the mind.Nonvirtue ripens on the body.Full ripening is primarily feeling, so is there any type that is only mental feeling and not bodily feeling? you ask. There is. Virtuous karma that is free o f con­sidering, from the levels of the special dhyana to the Peak of Existence, will fully ripen only as feelings in the m ind, or mental feelings, because bodily feeling is always accompanied by considering. This implicitly teaches that the full ripening of virtuous karma on the first dhyana and below is both mental and bodily feeling. N onvirtuous karma fully ripens on the body as bodily feeling only. It is not mental, because the suffering of m ind is mental unhap­piness, which is not a fully ripened result, as was explained in the “Teaching on Faculties.”210//. Where the distracted mind is58a A distraught m ind is mental mind.Well then, where does a distraught m ind come from, and what is its cause? you ask. A distraught and crazed m ind is in the mental m ind or consciousness. It is not in the consciousnesses of the five gates, because these do not think with thoughts that recognize and thoughts that remember.Hi. What results produce that58bc It’s born from fully ripened karma,From fear or harm, imbalance, sorrowIt, the distraught mind, is born from being confused by others through sub­stances or mantras, from being given intoxicants, and from other full ripenings o f karma.

What beings can have that58d Among the attached, not in the North.Which sentient beings can become distraught? It happens am ong the sentient beings who are attached, but not in the N orthern Unpleasant Sound, because if gods can be crazed, what need is there to speak of humans, hungry ghosts, hell beings, and animals? Except for the Bhagavan, nobles can be distraught because of imbalances of the elements, but they cannot be distraught by other causes or karma, because definite karmas ripened earlier when they were or­dinary individuals, and the indefinite ones do not ripen when they are nobles.ii.

Virtue itself of the Form realm is not mixed with nonvirtue and pro­duces only pleasant full ripening. T he virtue o f Desire is not mixed in its essence, but appears mixed with nonvirtue in one persons being, so its full ripening can be mixed with unpleasant full ripening of nonvirtue. For that reason, respectively these are the karm a that is taught in a sutra:Black karma that fully ripens as black, white karma that fully ripens as white, black and white karma that ripens as both black and w hite...That which does not have full ripening, is not afflicted, and discards or douses them, the other three karmas, is undefiled karma, which is described as:Karma that is neither white nor black, has no full ripening, and extinguishes other karma.(b) Specific explanation of the extinguisher.

Some say the two are what is felt In hell and elsewhere in Desire.Others call seeings discards black;The rest in Desire, black and white.Some masters say the two, black karma and black-and-white karma, are as follows: karma which is felt or experienced in hell is black karma that fully ripens as black, and karma experienced by other wanderers elsewhere in Desire is logically both black and white.

Others say that the karmas of seeing s discards are not mixed with virtue, so they are only black. The rest produced in Desire, the discards of meditation, are black-and-white karma, because it is possible for them to be either virtuous or nonvirtuous.b. Teaching the many enumerations of karma. This has two topics: i. Clas­sifying in terms of function, and ii. Explaining karmic paths in particular.i. Classifying in terms of function. This has five points.(1) Explaining the silence of the three64a—c Nonlearners’ karma of body and speech And just their m ind respectively Are silence of the three.Nonlearners’ undefiled karma o f body and speech and just their undefiled m ind, respectively are said in the sutras to be the silence of the three, body, speech, and mind. These have in the ultimate sense silenced and abandoned all the impediments of the three gates, and are free of everything afflicted.(2) Explaining the three cleansers64cd All threeFine conducts are three purifiers.The sutras tell of the three cleansers of body, speech, and mind. All three fine conduct of body, speech, and mind, are respectively the three purifiers of body, speech, and mind, because defiled fine conduct temporarily and undefiled fine conduct permanently abandon the stains of harmful action. The purpose of this is to rebut the non-Buddhist views that merely sitting without talking or falsely cleansing by washing on a river bank could cleanse or purify the stains.(3) Three types of harmful conduct65ab Nonvirtue of the body, et cetera,Is proposed as three harmful conducts.W hat are the three harmful actions the sutras teach? you ask.

The reason is that they are greed, hatred, and delusion, so they are not karma, because they are afflictions contained within the six root afflictions.212 The Darstantikas say the Conceived for That Purpose Sutra:213 teaches that covetousness and so forth only are mental karma.(5) Three types of fine conduct66 a Fine conduct is the opposite.Fine conduct is the virtues that are the opposite of those three types of harmful conduct of the three gates. These are the virtuous karma of the three gates, the absence of covetousness, the absence of malice, and the correct view.ii. Explaining karmic paths in particular. This has two topics: (1) Overview, and (2) Explanation.(1) Overview66 b—d Among them, to consolidate grossly,The various virtues and nonvirtues Are taught as the ten karmic paths.Among them , fine conduct and harmful conduct, to consolidate grossly or present very coarsely the actual basis, the various virtuous and nonvirtuous karmas are taught in the sutras as the ten virtuous and nonvirtuous karmic paths in order to know what to take up and what to give up. Saying “various” indicates that this is a coarse consolidation that does not include everything. W hat is not included? you ask. The preparations and aftermaths of the seven karmas of body and speech, and the mental karma of volition are not included. Additionally, many nonvirtues such as destroying stupas or beating sentient34i"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY # AREA IVbeings, and many virtues such as abandoning drinking alcohol, generosity, and pleasant speech are not included.(2) Explanation. This has four topics: (a) Classifications of perceptible and imperceptible, (b) The three virtuous and three nonvirtuous roots, (c) Teach­ing the three completing factors, and (d) Teaching the individual karmas.(a) Classifications of perceptible and imperceptible. This has two topics: (i) Actual and (ii) Additionally, ascertaining which are the preparation and the aftermath.(i) Actual. This has two points.A. Ascertaining which nonvirtue is67ab Six nonvirtues are imperceptible.The one is both. If done, they are as well.The six nonvirtues of body and speech excluding sexual misconduct are solely imperceptible when they arise from ordering somebody to do something. The one, sexual misconduct, cannot be completed by ordering someone else and must be done oneself, so it is both perceptible and imperceptible. If one does them oneself, they— the previous six— are both perceptible and imperceptible as well when completed at the time that the perceptible has not ceased, but imperceptible only when completed at the time that the perceptible has ceased.B. Ascertaining which virtue is67cd The seven virtues are both. W hat samadhi Produces is an imperceptible.The seven virtuous, material karmic paths are both perceptible and imper­ceptible because correct discipline is without a doubt dependent upon the per­ceptible. The dhyana and undefiled vows which samadhi produces are only imperceptible because they are dependent on just the mind.Previously it said in the Tika that undefiled vows have both perceptible and imperceptible aspects, but I cannot find the source and wonder whether it might be a typographical error.Here some say that the verse, “The percept and/Impercept of the first”214 presents the four possibilities of individual liberation and the vows of individ­342"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"KARMA AS EXPLAINED IN THE SUTRASual liberation, so the first m om ent of taking the vow correctly is individual liberation but not a vow. This is not harmed by the root text and commentary on the lines, “If done, they are as well./The seven virtues are b o th ...” because this teaches that there are both perceptibles and imperceptibles at the time of the actual basis of the seven karmic paths of body and speech. The perceptible of the first m om ent of taking a vow is not an actual karmic path, so they ex­plain that a vow of individual liberation is not pervasively imperceptible.Such twisted explanations appear to make many contradictions of both the root verses and the commentary, so it is like the chatter of common beings who have eaten thorn apple215 and is not worthy of being spoken by wise ex­alted beings such as yourselves. Modern students of the abhidharma, look at the entire root and commentary and choose your words carefully!(ii) Additionally, ascertaining which are the preparation and the aftermath68 a—c The preparations are perceptible.They might be imperceptible, or not.The aftermath is opposite of that.T he preparations for the seven virtuous and seven nonvirtuous karmic paths have without a doubt a perceptible nature. If they are undertaken out of in­tense entanglers216 or sincerity, they m ight be imperceptible, or if with a weak mind, not. T he afterm ath of the karmic path is the opposite o f that, the preparations. Until it is canceled, there is definitely an imperceptible. If one performs an action that is in accord with the actual basis, there is also a per­ceptible, but if not, there is none.Well then, what is the distinction between preparation, actual basis of the karmic path, and aftermath? you ask. W hen someone wishes to kill a living creature, the actions from getting up off the seat, approaching that being, tak­ing a weapon, and striking the creature once or twice, until actually taking the life of that being, are the preparations. The perceptible and imperceptible moment of striking the creature and taking its life is the actual karmic path. The following imperceptible moments and the perceptible skinning the ani­mal, selling, cooking, eating its meat, and so forth are the aftermath. It is sim­ilar with the other six.Covetousness, malice, and wrong view do not depend upon the actual basis or the aftermath, but become a karmic path by merely manifesting.(b) The three virtuous and three nonvirtuous roots. This has two topics:(i) Nonvirtuous, and (ii) Virtuous.343"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?*- AREA IV(i) Nonvirtuous. This has two points.A. Roots of nonvirtue of body and speech68 d The preparations come from the three roots.From a sutra:Bhikshus, taking life is threefold: that produced by greed, hatred, and delusion...The others up to wrong view are taught similarly. The meaning of this is that the motivation of the preparations for the seven karmic paths of body and speech come or arise from the three nonvirtuous roots. Taking life produced by desire is killing out of craving for meat and so forth; that produced by ha­tred is killing for revenge; and that produced by delusion is animal sacrifice, or the Persians killing their elderly parents or those who are extremely ill, and so on. Stealing and so forth are similar.B. Roots of nonvirtue of the mind69ab They follow the three roots immediately,So coveting and so forth come from them.They follow the three roots, the three poisons, immediately, so coveting and so forth also come from them.(ii) Virtuous69cd The virtues, preparation, aftermath,Arise from nongreed, nonhate, nondelusion.The virtuous karmic paths, their preparations, and their aftermath, arise from nongreed, nonhate, and nondelusion, because they are motivated by a virtu­ous mind and such virtuous minds are concurrent with nongreed and so forth. These discard the nonvirtuous aftermaths.For example, the perceptible and imperceptible karmas of a novice who wishes to take full ordination up until they complete the actual basis are the preparation. The perceptible and imperceptible attained during the phrase “For that purpose, if the Sangha grants full ord in atio n ...” on the third re­petition o f the motion is the actual basis, and those from then on are the aftermath.217344"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"KARMA AS EXPLAINED IN THE SUTRAS(c) Teaching the three completing factors.

The basis for wrong view is feeling and the other four aggregates of name and the aggregate of form, and the basis for the other four of lying and so forth is a collection of words, be­cause speech engages words.(in) Delineating what is or is not the actual basis. This has two points.A. Those which seem to be but are not72a—c W hen killers die before or else Together, there’s no actual—They’ve been born in another body.If a killer and his victim should die together or the killer should die first, is there an actual basis of karma or not? you ask. W hen killers die before or else together with their victims, there is no actual karmic path, because at the time that the taking of life is completed, they, the killer, have been reborn in an­other body than the one in which they performed the preparations.B. Those that do not seem to be but are7 2 d -f In wars and so forth all of them Have the same goal, so all possess The karma, like the perpetrator.Well then, when many people gather and agree to make war or so forth, if one person actually deprives another sentient being of life, do the others also have the misdeed of taking life or not? you ask. In wars, hunts, and so forth, all of those sentient beings have the preparations for the same goal and so forth, so all those who are not actually killers possess the actual karmic path of taking life, like the perpetrator who did the actual killing. Those who were conscripted against their will possess it if they later develop a m ind intent upon the same goal, but if they do not wish to do harm even at the cost of their own life, they do not possess it.(d) Teaching the individual karmas.

Karma of mind, and 4. The distinction between karma and karmic paths.1. Karma of the body. This has three points.a. Taking life73 ab To take life is to kill another Intentionally, unerringly.W hat is the nature of taking life and the other karmic paths? you ask. To take life is to kill another being— someone other than oneself—intentionally, thinking “I will kill him.” It is unerringly killing the one whom the killer in­tended to kill. Thus it has three aspects, otherwise it possesses merely the harm of the preparation.Life is a nonconcurrent formation or the distinctive wind that occurs based on the support of the body and mind. Taking it is merely preventing it from continuing.b. Taking what is not given73 cd To steal is to make another’s wealth O ne’s own by force or thievery.To steal or take what’s not given is to make another’s wealth one s own either by force through actually robbing or by thievery, taking w ithout being de­tected. Here also it must be intentional and unerring. Merely taking without the intention to make it one’s own does not constitute a fault, and taking Ya- jnadatta’s things when one wanted to take Devadatta’s merely produces the fault of preparation, not that of the actual basis.Well then, if one takes what has been offered to a stupa, an unowned treas­ure, or the wealth of a dead monk, from whom is one taking without being given? you ask. In the first instance, one is taking from the Buddha, in the second, from the king of that region, and in the third from the Sangha, which are extremely grave faults.347"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IVc.

Wrong view78bc Believing there’s no virtue or Nonvirtue is wrong view.Believing there is no virtue or nonvirtue is like this: saying that there is no generosity, no burnt offerings, no offerings, and no fine conduct is denial of cause. Saying there is no fully ripening of the result of fine conduct and harmful conduct is denial of result. Saying that this world, the next world, fathers, mothers, and miraculous birth of sentient beings do not exist is de­nial of function. Saying there are no arhats in the loka is a view that destroys existing things. Such views are w rong views. The root teaches the denial of cause explicitly as an illustration of the others.4. The distinction between karma and karmic paths78cd O f these,Three are paths and seven karma, too.O f these nonvirtues, the three of m ind are the gates to enter karmic volition, so they are karmic paths, but they are not karma.

What severs them79 a The nihilist view severs the rootsT he nihilist view that there is no cause and result from the ten nonvirtues severs the roots of virtue. The others are exclusive of virtue but do not sever the roots.However, the T reatise says:Well then, what are the great roots of nonvirtue? you ask. The roots of nonvirtue are that which severs the roots of virtue and that which is discarded first of all by those who attain detachment from Desire.Is this not contradictory? you say. It is not contradictory. The intent of this is that the roots of nonvirtue lead to wrong view. Therefore it is like saying that the thief who set the fire burned the town down even though he is not himself the actual combustion.b. What is severed79b O f Desire that were attained at birth.W hich roots of virtue are severed? you ask. The roots of virtue of Desire that were attained at birth are completely severed, because the person who has the wrong view that severs the roots of virtue does not have the virtue or nonvirtue of the two higher realms, and because the attainment of those that were at­tained by training in listening, contemplating, and meditating was previously severed when he had the lesser of lesser wrong views.c.

Wrong views that are a denial of cause, saying there is no fine or harmful conduct, and re­sult, saying there is no full ripening of result, sever the roots.Some say those that focus on the defiled and realms of the same status sever the roots, but those that focus on the undefiled and realms of different status do not sever them. Here the Great Exposition explains that denial of cause and effect and all that focuses on the same or different status or on defiled or undefiled sever them.351"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IVd. How they are severed79d Gradual.Some say that like the discards of seeing, the roots of virtue are severed at once. Here, however, similar to the afflictions discarded by meditation, the nine roots of virtue are gradually severed by the nine wrong views from the least of lesser wrong view, middling of lesser wrong view, and so forth up to the great­est of greater wrong views, which severs the smallest of small roots of virtue. This is also the Masters explanation.e. What support they are severed on79d By humans. They are cut80a By men and women acting on views.They are severed by hum ans but not by other wanderers, because in the lower realms afflicted and unafflicted full knowing are not stable, the gods perceive karma and result directly, and in Unpleasant Sound there is no intention to perform misdeeds, so they are not severed there. Thus they are cut or severed by the m en and wom en of the three continents. The sexless, neuters, and so forth, do not sever them. Among them craving is very powerful, so they do not cut them, because they have unstable intentions, like beings in the lower realms. The roots are severed by those who act on strong views, because they have stable, sinful intentions and are ensnared by nonvirtue.f. Its essence80b The severance is nonpossession.W hen the roots of virtue have been severed, the attainment of the virtuous roots also does not arise, so it is said that if the nonpossession or nonattain­ment of the virtuous roots arises, they have been severed.2. How they are restored. This has two points.a. Actual80c Restored by doubt and view of existence;How are the virtuous roots restored? you ask.

How they are restored in those who have committed a heinous deed80d WhoVe done a heinous deed, not here.If one has not done a heinous deed, the roots can be restored in the very same lifetime. The virtuous roots of individuals who have done a heinous deed can not be restored here, in this lifetime. If they were severed by conditions, they will be restored in the between state before birth in hell, and if severed by causes, they are restored when about to die and transmigrate from hell. There are four possibilities of those who have severed the roots of virtue and those who are destined for the mistaken:218 the first is Purana Kas'yapa and the other five logicians. The second is King Ajatasatru. The third is Devadatta. The fourth is people other than those.(ii) How many karmic paths can simultaneously engage volition. This has two points.A. How many nonvirtues can simultaneously engage volition8 lab Up to eight nonvirtues and volition Can simultaneously arise;To analyze how many karmic paths and one volition can arise simultaneously: as far as the nonvirtues, because it is possible for any one of the three of m ind and the seven of body and speech— either done by oneself or by ordering oth­ers— to be completed simultaneously, from one up to eight nonvirtues and volition can simultaneously arise. Nine or ten cannot arise, because it is im­possible for the three of m ind to arise simultaneously, and sexual misconduct cannot be completed by ordering another.B. How many virtues can simultaneously engage volition8 led W hen they are virtuous, up to ten,And yet not one, not eight, not five.W hen they, the karmic paths, are virtuous, up to ten can arise with a single353"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY i* AREA IVvolition in general, and yet in particular, there is not only one single karmic path and volition, because the absence of covetousness and absence of malice come together with a virtuous mind, and there is no vow that has the nature o f only abandoning one discard.Volition does not arise simultaneously with only eight, because a bhikshu who has abandoned seven has seven when he has an afflicted or neutral con­temporaneous motivation, and when he has a virtuous mind of the five sense consciousnesses, nongreed and nonhatred both arise, so there are nine, and if it is mental consciousness, there is also the correct view for ten.It does n ot arise simultaneously with only five, because if one is a novice or holds the lay precepts it is impossible to have a single virtue of m ind in addi­tion to the four discards: if it is one of the five sense consciousnesses, in addi­tion to the four discards there are nongreed and nonhatred, which both arise for a total of six, and if it is mental consciousness, in addition to those there is correct view for a total of seven.(iii) Which wanderers have how many karmic paths.

How many there are in hell82a-c In hell, there is chatter, and harsh words,And malice in two ways; wrong view And covetousness by possession.How many of the virtuous and nonvirtuous paths are there, both manifest and in terms of possession? you ask. In hell, as there is lamentation and wail­ing, there are idle chatter, and the harsh words of quarrels with one another, and the malice that motivates them. These three exist in the two ways of being manifest and by possession. There is covetousness and wrong view by pos­session, as they have not been abandoned by an antidote, but they are not manifest, because there are no things to desire and karma and result are directly perceived.In the hells, killing someone does not make them die, there is no ownership of sexual partners or things, there is no need to lie, and there is no one who is near to one’s heart so everyone is already divided. For that reason, the five from taking life to divisive speech are not manifestly present, nor is there any attainment of them.354"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"KARMA AS EXPLAINED IN THE SUTRAS2. How many there are in Unpleasant Sound82d There are three in Unpleasant Sound.83a The seventh is manifest there, too.There are three of m ind that are possessed in Unpleasant Sound, but they are not manifest, because there is no clinging to mine, their beings are gentle, there is nothing cruel, and they do not have sinful intentions. The seventh, idle chatter of singing songs out of desire and so forth, is manifest there, in Unpleasant Sound, too. The other six of taking life and so forth are not m an­ifest, because they do not have sinful intentions, the lifespan is definite, and there is no ownership of sexual partners or things. Whoever wishes to behave impurely takes the hand of the woman he desires and goes near a tree. If she is someone who may be lain with, the tree screens them and they lie together, and if not, the tree does not screen them and they do not.3.

To il­lustrate this through the example of taking life, the dom inant result of the karmic path of taking life is that one does not have any beautiful external things and so forth. The causally compatible result is that one is born as a hum an but has a short life and so forth. The fully ripened result is to be born in the hells.2. The reason85cd Since it makes suffering, and kills,And destroys vigor, three results.W hy do these karmic paths create the three results? you ask. To illustrate with taking life, since one makes another being suffer, there is the fully ripened re­sult of enduring the suffering of the hells, and because killing prevents life from continuing, the causally compatible result is a short life. Because it de­stroys vigor in the region of the heart, the dom inant result is to be born with little vigor or power. There are these three results. The remaining, taking what is not given and so forth, are similar.The lesser, medium, and greater results of the virtues are respectively birth among humans, gods of Desire, and the gods of the higher realms.

W hat are the character­istics of these? you ask.Some say that im proper karma is afflicted karma, because of inappropriate attention itself. Alternatively, actions that have degenerated from the aban­donm ent of the five wrong ways of acting are improper actions as well, some say, because the way the person walks, sits, eats, dresses are improper or not in accord with custom, so it is called improper action. Proper action is virtuous karma. Others say it is ways that are not degenerate. Karma other than those two is neither.ii. The attributes of propelling and completing karma. This has three points.(1) The attributes of propelling karma95a One action propels one rebirth.Does one action propel only one rebirth or does it propel multiple rebirths? Likewise, do multiple actions propel one rebirth or do they propel multiple rebirths? you ask. This is the position of this school: one action propels only one rebirth. One action does not propel multiple rebirths, and multiple ac­tions do not propel one rebirth.Well then, in a sutra, Elder Aniruddha said to the monks:By that one merit fully ripening, I was born seven times among the gods of the Thirty-Three, until I was born now in the clan of the rich Shakyas.Is this not contradictory? you ask. It is not. The meaning of this is that when he was born in the higher realms, he remembered his previous birth and out of enthusiasm performed more virtue, which led him to be reborn there again. For example, it is like when one finds a single coin, uses it to make a profit, becomes rich, and then says, “I got rich from a single coin.”(2) The attributes of completing karma95 b There are multiple completing factors.If many karmas propelled a single birth, many similar likenesses would be pro­pelled, which is not logical.

In the first three life is annihilated, and in a schism the Sanghas har­mony is destroyed. The Tathagata cannot be killed by anyone, but one makes the preparations to do so.B. As an elaboration, dispelling doubts. This has three topics: 1. Dispelling doubts about killing one’s mother, 2. Dispelling doubts about drawing blood with an evil intent, and 3.

If one kills his mother whose organ has changed...Murdering ones father whose sex has changed is comparable.b. Dispelling the doubt about when the fetus is transplanted into another womb103d She whose menses bore one is the mother.If one is conceived in one woman’s womb and then transplanted into an­other, m urdering which o f the two is a heinous deed? you ask. She whose menses bore one is the m other, so m urdering her is a heinous deed. The other is similar to a m other so of course she deserves respect, but murdering her is not actually a heinous deed.2. Dispelling doubts about drawing blood with an evil intent104a Intent to beat the Buddha is not,Drawing blood from the Buddha becomes a heinous act because o f the in­tention to kill the Buddha, but if one draws blood when intending to beat up the Buddha, it is n o t a heinous deed, because there is no intention that he die.3. Dispelling doubts about killing arhats104b Nor if they become an arhat later.N or is the killing a heinous deed if one strikes someone who is not an arhat with a weapon and they become an arhat later, after being struck.

To tell a lie in order to split the Sangha even while knowing the difference between dharma and nondharma is proposed to be the gravest of crimes, because it pierces the Tathagatas dharma body and because it hinders worldly ones on the path to the higher realms and the freedom of enlightenment. Among the heinous deeds, killing one’s mother, killing an arhat, and drawing blood from the Tathagata with an evil intent are each successively heavier than the previ­ous; killing one’s father is lighter.(c) Additional points on karma and result105cd O f worldly virtues, the volitionO f Peak bears the greatest result.Among the fine conducts, which has the greatest result? you ask. O f all worldly virtuous karmas, the volition o f the Peak of Existence bears the greatest fully ripened result, because it ripens as eighty thousand great aeons in the higher realms.

To violate one s arhat m other through sexual misconduct, to kill a certain Bodhisattva or killing an Aryan learner, and to rob food for one day or more that has been gathered for the Sanghas purpose. These four are similar to the first four heinous deeds of killing one’s mother and so forth so they are near it. The one near the fifth is to destroy a stupa, the place of offering to the body, speech, and mind.

He has the two qualities of recalling his lifetimes and being irreversible or unable to be turned away from attaining awakening. In order to benefit all sentient beings, he is not discouraged by any aspect of suffering or any misunderstanding.C. Explaining his aspects109. A male in Rose-Apple Land, when present,W ith the volition to awaken,Through contemplation, propels these Over one hundred aeons more.110a Each arises from one hundred merits.Only a being on the support of a male in Rose-Apple Land can propel the karmas that will ripen as the marks; inhabitants of other continents or females cannot. He accumulates them when a Teacher who is the object for accumu­lating the karma is actually present. W hether the volition of, “May I become a buddha in this way” is manifest or hidden, he performs the karmas only with the volition that focuses on awakening. Karma born of listening is low, and that born of meditation does not ripen in Desire, so this is born through contemplation. He propels these over one hundred great aeons more, so they are not visible results. From his diligence in praising the Buddha Tisya, our Teacher shortened that by nine aeons, and propelled the karma through more than ninety-one aeons. As it says in a sutra, “Village chief, I remember from ninety-one aeons to now completely... ” so he naturally remembers his life­times. Each o f the fully ripened thirty-two major marks that are thus propelled arises from one hundred merits or volitions. As far as the quantity counted as one hundred, some say that it is the same as all the merit from generosity of all sentient beings.

In the first incalculable aeon, he paid respects to seventy-five thousand buddhas, in the second, seventy-six thousand, and in the third, to seventy-seven thousand buddhas. Among them, the last buddhas o f the first three uncountable aeons respectively were the buddhas Vipashyin, Dipankara, and Ratnashikhin, who had appeared. Before all of those, the first buddha to appear was called the Sage of the Shakyas, or Shakyamuni. He appeared in a time of strife, and his life span, the duration of his teachings, his mother, and so on, were all similar to our Teacher s.

The nature of each classification. This has two topics: (1) Explaining merit born of generosity, and (2) Explaining the other two merits.(1) Explaining merit born of generosity.

Clothes and so forth that are given are called by that name, but they are not actually generosity be­cause they are neutral. Likewise, giving without the motivation of virtuous volition, such as out of fear, a wish for a response, desire, or so forth, is not virtuous, so it is not giving that is generosity. Thus generosity is giving with a wish to offer or to help, which are distinguished in terms of the recipient.225 It is the body and speech virtuous karma, and motivating intention that is concurrent with nongreed along with its associations.

W hen nobles who are not detached or ordinary individuals who are detached give to another sentient being, that is generosity for the benefit o f both self and other.

If you give to humans with faulty sila, hope for one thousand times the full ripening.The superior field of suffering is such as among the seven material merits,226 giving nursing, or giving during cold seasons. The superior field of benefit is giving to parents and other benefactors.

Identifying the supreme of the eight types of generosity 117d Eighth.Likewise, from a sutra:Generosity is eightfold: giving to the near; giving out of fear; giving because someone has given to you; giving so that someone will give to you; giving because your parents gave before; giving for the purpose of the higher realms; giving out of desire for fame; and giving in order to attain the m ind s ornament, the m ind s neces­sities, the collection of yogas, and the supreme pur­pose.O f these, the eighth, giving for the purpose of attaining the m ind’s ornament and so forth, is supreme.2272.

They give all beings who are blinded by ignorance the eye of full knowing, teach what is Dharma and what is not, and accomplish the undefiled dharma body, and in brief, ac­complish the activity of the buddhas, so they are spiritual friends. For that reason, they are the field of benefit.E. Elaborations. This has three points.1. Distinctions in size382"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"KARMA AS EXPLAINED IN THE SUTRAS119.

The af­term ath of completing the karmic path, the field to which help or harm is done, the base of any of the karmic paths of the three gates, the preparation that begins the karmic path, the volition that motivates karmic paths of body and speech, and the intention, too, that thinks, “I will do this in this way.” W hen these six causes are great or small in scope, the karma, too, is great, that is, heavy, or small, that is, light.2. The distinction between accumulated and not accumulated120.

It is karma that is neither unwitting nor involuntary but that is done after consideration, or intentionally; that is completed, by which it will have full ripening, and that is done w ithout regret after the karma is completed; that has no antidote; that is karma that has a definitely experienced full ripen­ing; and that has all the corresponding associations.229 Due to these, karma is called accumulated.3. Dispelling doubts121. Giving to stupas is merit causedBy giving: as with love, not taken.Cause and result are infallible,So bad fields, too, bear pleasant fruit.W hen someone who is detached gives to a stupa, there is no enjoyment of the gift, so how is it meritorious? you ask. There are two types of merit: merit that is caused by giving, and merit that is caused by enjoyment. The merit of giving to stupas is merit caused not by enjoyment, but merit that is caused by giving. For example, it is as w ith meditation on loving-kindness or the others of the four immeasurables, or like the correct worldly view, which are meritorious, even though it is not taken or does not benefit another.383"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA IVWell then, if it is logical that being generous with gifts to a good field pro­duces a pleasant result, how is it that giving to a bad field brings a pleasant re­sult? Because whatever type a cause might be, the result born from it is infallibly of the same type, so it is logical that giving to a bad field, too, should bear a pleasant fruit or result. For example, grape seeds produce sweet fruits, and neem seeds produce bitter fruits.(2) Explaining the other two merits.

The four or seven abandonments of nonvirtuous form is discipline. T h at discarding is the twofold discipline of the perceptible by which one dis­cards immorality and the imperceptible that is the discarding.B. Its antidote, discipline122c That which the Buddha barred as well.Discipline is not pervasively the antidote for immorality. There are things that may be done in particular times or circumstances but in other times and cir­cumstances become the causes of the inherently unwholesome. This is because that which not immoral by nature but which the Buddhas word barred, such as swearing not to eat at wrong times, has both perceptible and imperceptible forms and is discipline as well. Having sworn to the precept of abandoning something, if one does it, it becomes immoral, because it is disrespectful of the Bhagavan’s word. This teaches implicitly that it is not immoral for those who have not sworn to the discipline.384"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"KARMA AS EXPLAINED IN THE SUTRASC.

These three are synonyms of afflicted dharmas.C. Synonyms of the virtuous127b-d Stainless virtuesAre sublime. Practice compounded virtue.And liberation is unexcelled.The undefiled or stainless virtues are the ultimate of purity, so they are called sublime. Practice com pound virtues, because they produce an attractive result and are something to be familiar with. Because other things lack these two reasons, they are not something one practices. All other dharmas are excelled by something, but there is no dharma at all that is superior to the liberation of nirvana, so it is also called unexcelled, because it is virtuous and permanent.

For origin and cessation, there are these ten ex­cluding the three views of personality, extreme, and overesteeming discipline and austerity, or else for the path, the first two personality and extreme views, because a discard must mistakenly engage the truths either directly or indi­rectly, and those views do not mistakenly engage those truths.W hen the nature of the truths of suffering and so forth— origin, cessation, and path— o f Desire is seen, they are discarded in order.B.

The Formless is like that.In the higher realms, one’s being is moistened by tranquility, the bodily sup­port is clear, and the basis for anger’s development, the feeling of suffering, is absent. Therefore excluding anger, these same thirty-one kernels function in the Form realm. T he Formless is like that Form realm with thirty-one kernels.

This has two topics: (1) Classifying views, and (2) Classifying pride.(1) Classifying views. This has three topics: (a) The nature of each of the five views, (b) The reason the fifth is not a discard of seeing the origin, and(c) Classifying as the four erroneous.(a) The nature of each of the five views7. As me, mine; permanent and ceasing;As nonexistent; overesteeming The low; and viewing what is not cause O r path as such: these are five views.W hat is the nature of the five views? you ask. W hen focusing on the aggregates of grasping, viewing them as me and mine is personality view. Viewing that me itself as perm anent or ceasing is extreme view. Viewing the truth of suf­fering and so forth as nonexistent is wrong view. Overesteeming the low, per­sonality view, and the others, is overesteeming the view. And viewing w hat is not the cause— Indra, the Lord of Living Creatures Brahma, and so forth— as the cause, viewing what is not the cause of high realms— entering fire and water and so forth235— as the cause of high realms, or viewing what is not the path— mere sila and austerity— as such is overesteeming discipline and aus­terity. These are the natures of each of the five views.(b) The reason the fifth is not a discard of seeing the origin8. Since clinging to Ishvara, et cetera,As cause, initially mistakes Them to be permanent and self,Just seeing suffering discards it.If viewing as a cause what is not a cause is overesteeming discipline and aus­terity, why is it not also a discard of seeing origin? you ask. This is since cling­ing to or holding Ishvara, et cetera— things that are not causes— as causes394"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE KERNELSinitially engage by power of mistaken views of them as perm anent and as a self. Directly seeing the characteristics of the truth of suffering eliminates cling­ing to permanence and a self. W hen that has been abandoned, viewing Ishvara and so forth who are not causes to be causes is also discarded. For that reason just seeing suffering discards it, clinging to Ishvara and so forth as causes.(c) Classifying as the four erroneous. This has two points.(1) Actual9a—c Among three views, there are four errors,Since they’re mistaken, since they’re thoughts That judge, since they exaggerate.Well then, must the errors necessarily be just the two errors of self and per­manence? you ask. Not necessarily. From among the three views of personality, extreme, and holding view supreme, there are four errors presented as one set. Clinging to a self is presented from personality view. The view of perma­nence is presented out of extreme view. Views of the clean and blissful are pre­sented out of holding views supreme.Well then, other afflictions are not presented as errors, so why are these three presented as errors? you say. They are presented as errors because of three reasons: because they are solely mistaken about their focus, since they are thoughts that judge, and since they exaggerate. Other afflictions do not fulfill one or more of those reasons, so they are not presented as errors.(ii) Additional point9d M ind and conception, from their power.Well then, both m ind and conception must not be errors, because they do not make one have thoughts that judge. If you agree, it is contradictory of the sutras which tell of both erroneous m ind and erroneous conception, you say. This is not contradictory, because m ind and conception are concurrent with those erroneous views and so are presented as erroneous from their power.Well then, the feelings that are concurrent with those three also become er­roneous, you say.

Nine types, three.There are not only classifications of views: pride can be classified as well. There are seven types of pride: pride, superior pride, more proud than pride, pride in thinking me, pride of exaggeration, pride in thinking almost, and mistaken pride. The first is the conceit of thinking one is better than an inferior, and that one is equal to his equals. The second is thinking one is superior to his equals. The third is thinking one is superior to his betters. The fourth is the conceit of thinking, “T hat’s me” when focusing on the aggregates of grasping. The fifth is the conceit of thinking one has attained clairvoyant powers when one has not. The sixth is the conceit of thinking one is almost as good as his superiors. The seventh is thinking one has qualities he does not.In the treatise ]ndnaprasthana:, there are nine aspects of pride that are taught. The nine types are included in three: pride, superior pride, and pride in think­ing almost.(ii) What antidotes discard them10b Destroyed by seeing, meditation.Those seven prides are destroyed by either the path of seeing or the path of meditation, because those concurrent with discards of seeing are extinguished by seeing and those concurrent with discards of meditation are extinguished by meditation.(iii) Why discards of meditation do not manifest themselves in nobles' be­ings even though they have not been discarded1 Ocd Discards of meditation areEntangled with killing and so forth.11.

The views and doubts that one discards By seeing suffering and cause And simultaneous and unmixed Ignorance are the universals.Among the kernels, how many are universal, and how many are not universal? you ask.236 There are eleven universal kernels of same status: seven views— the five views discarded by seeing the truth of suffering plus the two discarded by seeing the truth of origin, wrong view and overesteeming view— two doubts that one discards by seeing the truths of suffering and cause; and the igno­rance that is sim ultaneous with those; and unm ixed ignorance that is not mixed with other kernels. These are the universal kernels of same status be­cause they focus on all five classes of discards of their own level.(2) Universals of realms of dissimilar status13ab O f these, the nine can focus higher,Excluding two views.O f these eleven universals, the nine kernels can focus on higher levels and397"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA Vrealms, so they are universals of realms of dissimilar status. This is excluding the two of personality and extreme views, because these view only the aggre­gates of one s own being mistakenly. The way these nine focus is that some­times they focus on one realm of dissimilar status and sometimes on two, as is stated in the Treatise.(3) Explaining other universals than those13b-d W hat arisesAlong with them is universalAs well, attainment not included.Are only kernels universal? you ask. W hat arises along with and at the same time as them , the kernels— feelings, etc., and arising, etc.— is universal as well. However, attainm ent is not included, because the kernels and attainment have dissimilar results, attainment does not produce full ripening, and their compatible causes are also dissimilar.Here there are four alternatives between universal kernels and universal causes.ii. Distinctions of focusing on the undefiled or not. This has two topics:(1) Those that focus on the undefiled, and (2) Those that do not focus on the undefiled.(1) Those that focus on the undefiled. This has two points.(a) Overview14. Wrong views and doubts discarded by Seeing cessation and the path,Concurrent and plain ignorance:These six take the undefiled as sphere.How many of them focus on the defiled? How many focus on the unde­filed? you ask. The two w rong views and two doubts discarded by seeing cessation and the path, the ignorance that is concurrent with them, and plain, unmixed ignorance: these six take the undefiled cessation and path as their sph ere; those two are their object. In aspects, they engage them through denial, through being of two minds or other doubt, or through unclear aspect.398"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE KERNELSThe mistaken engagements that focus on mistaken engagement of cessation and path and the mistaken engagements of suffering and origin focus on the defiled.237(b) Explanation15. Cessation that is of their level.Because paths can be mutual causes,The paths of the six and nine levels Are objects of whose sphere they are.The object of the wrong views discarded by seeing cessation is the antidote, cessation that is of their own level. Because paths can be m utually causes of same status, the paths compatible with the dharma knowing o f the six levels of dhyana are objects of the three of wrong views, et cetera, of Desire that have those paths as their sphere. And all the paths compatible with the subsequent knowing of the nine undefiled levels are the objects o f wrong view, et cetera, of the eight higher levels whose sphere they, the paths, are in, because these paths are definitely in the family of antidotes of those levels.(2) Those that do not focus on the undefiled16. Desire does not, since its discarded.Nor hatred, since they do not harm.Since they are peace, pure, and supreme,Pride does not, nor does overesteeming.Desire does n ot focus on cessation and path since its focus is that which is discarded only. Otherwise it would be like intention toward virtuous dharmas. Hatred focuses on things that generate hostility, so nor does hatred focus on cessation and path, since they do no harm. Additionally, since they are both peace, because they are pure and purifying, and because they are supreme, re­spectively, pride does not focus on the peaceful, nor are they the object of the views of overesteeming— the fifth view that holds what is not a purifier to be so, and the view of holding view supreme, which holds the inferior to be supreme. In this way, those that focus on the undefiled are direct mistaken engagements. Those that focus on the defiled of those two classes are mistaken engagements of mistaken engagements.iii. Developed by concurrence and by focus. This has two points.399"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA V(1) Those which develop through focus17. The universal kernels canDevelop through a focus on Any that is of their own level.Nonuniversal, on own class.18ab N ot those whose sphere is high or stainless,Since those are not made mine, since anti.Among the kernels, how many develop in terms of their focus? How many develop in terms of concurrence? you ask. The universal kernels can develop through a focus on any of the afflicted five classes th at is o f their own level. The nonuniversal develop through focus on their own class. This is in general.Specifically, the kernels that do not develop through focus are those uni­versal kernels whose sphere is the higher levels and the nonuniversals whose sphere is the stainless. This is since the kernels develop in relation to things that are divided into sets by craving and made into “mine” through self-view, whereas those are not made mine. It is also since the undefiled and higher levels are in the class of their antidotes, so they are overwhelmed. For example, a burning stone is not a place where one can rest the sole of one’s foot.(2) Those which develop through concurrence18cd The ones concurrent with one, thenDevelop through concurrence with that.T he ones, kernels, which are concurrent w ith one cognition, feeling, or other dharma, then develop through concurrence w ith th at dharma. The word “then” draws the distinction that this is as long as it has not been abandoned. Kernels, such as the two concurrences with pleasure and greed, that have been abandoned when past are on the past level, and when future, they are simul­taneously on the future level. However, they do not develop, as in the example of Shariputra.238Therefore, all kernels that focus on the undefiled and all those which focus on the higher realms’ defiled develop only through concurrence. The remain­der develop through either focus or concurrence. There are none which de­velop solely through focus.iv. Classification as nonvirtuous and neutral.

In Desire,The personality, extreme,And simultaneous ignorance.The rest here are nonvirtuous.How many of the kernels are nonvirtuous? How many are neutral? you ask. The kernels that arise in the higher Form and Formless realms are all neutral, because the full ripening of afflicted dharmas is suffering, and that is in neither of those two as there is no cause for harming another. In Desire, the view of personality, the view of holding extremes, and simultaneous ignorance— ig­norance concurrent with them— are neutral, because they are not exclusive of generosity and other such virtuous dharmas, and because they look inward so they are unable to motivate harmful conduct. T he rest, kernels other than those three, here in the Desire realm are nonvirtuous.(2) Specifics of the roots. This has two topics: (a) The roots of nonvirtue, and(b) The roots of the neutral.(a) The roots of nonvirtue20ab Desire, aversion, and delusionIn Desire are the roots of nonvirtue.How many of them are roots of nonvirtue? How many are not? you ask. All desire, aversion, and delusion in the Desire realm, except those concurrent with personality view and extreme view, are the roots of nonvirtue. Only those that are both nonvirtues and also the roots of nonvirtue are agreed to be the roots of nonvirtue. The remaining kernels of doubt and pride are nonvirtuous, but they are not the roots of nonvirtue.(b) The roots of the neutral.

How many are not? you ask. The Kashmiris say that there are three roots of the neutral. They, the roots, are craving, and ignorance, and intelligence or full knowing. The latter can be arisen from full ripening, but those that are slightly neutral are the roots of the neutral.239 Others, doubt and pride, which are other than those kernels, act in doubt s case dually and unstably, and in pride s case loftily, they do not deserve to be called roots. In common parlance, roots are said to be things that are stable and underneath. So thus they, doubt and pride, are not roots, because they are dissimilar to roots, it is said.(ii) Aparantakas' tradition21 b -d The BahyakaPropose these four: craving, view, pride,Delusion. From ignorance, three dhyanists.T he Bahyaka (Aparantakas) propose these four roots of the neutral: craving, view, pride, and delusion. W hat is the reason? you ask.

They are questions whose answer was not actually indicated, so they are called neutral or indeterminate. Giving a categorical response, dis­tinguishing response, and questioning response, and the declining response are four ways to answer queries. The first of these is like when asked, “Will all beings die?” answering, “They will die.” The second is like when asked, “Will all who die be reborn?” answering, “Those who have not extinguished the afflictions will be reborn, but those who have will not.” The third is like when asked, “Is this person inferior or superior?” responding with the ques­tion, “In relation to whom? In relation to gods he is inferior. In relation to the lower realms, he is superior.” The fourth is like when asked, “Is the self other than the aggregates or not?” This is asking about nonexistent attributes,402"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE KERNELSlike whether the child of a childless woman is blue or white, so it is something to put aside only.

Scriptural proof25ab it was said.Since two,The times exist because it was taught in a sutra:Bhikshus, if there were no past form, the well-versed noble listeners would not view past forms, but because past form exists, the well-versed noble listeners view past form ...So it was said. It is also since it was said that consciousness arises from the two, object and faculty.404"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE KERNELSB. Logical proof25b objects exist, result.The past and future exist in their own time because if the focused object exists, consciousness arises, but if it does not exist, consciousness does not arise. Since the past and future can be objects of the m ind consciousness, they must there­fore exist. Also because there is production by past karma of a later fully ripened result, we know the past exists.(Mi) Teaching that this is the tradition of the Great Exposition. This has three points: A. Actual, B. Divisions of schools, and C. Analyzing which of the four traditions is best.A. Actual25cd Because they say these all exist,They’re called Those W ho Say All Exists.Someone who claims to be a Sarvastivadin must certainly hold this position, it is known. Because they say these three times all exist, they are called Those W ho Say All Exists, or Sarvastivadin. Those who distinguish and say the pres­ent and past karma that has not yet produced a result exist, but the future and the past that has produced a result do not exist, are called Vibhajyavadin, those who say there is a distinction.B. Divisions of schools26ab They’re four, called thing and character And state and relative dependence.They, the Sarvastivadins, have four traditions, called transforming thing, transforming characteristics, transforming state, and relative dependence.The first of these is the tradition of the Venerable Dharmatrata. He says that as dharmas progress through time, the thing transforms, but the substance does not transform. For example, if you destroy a gold vessel and make it into some­thing else, the shape has changed but the gold’s color and nature do not change.The second is the tradition of Venerable Ghosaka. He says that as dharmas progress through time, in the past it possesses the characteristics of the past, but it does not not possess the characteristics of the other two times. The others times are similar. For example, when one man feels manifest lust for one woman, he is not free of desire for others.405"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VThe third is the tradition of Venerable Vasumitra. He says that as dharmas progress through time, when the action has not been done, they are future. W hen the action is being done, they are present. W hen the action has been done and ceased, they are past. W hen they go from one time period to another, they are different in terms of being in a different state, but not in terms of substance. For example, if you put a token in the ones column it is called “one,” but if you put it in the hundreds column it is called “one hundred.” The fourth is the tradition of Venerable Buddhadeva. He says that as dhar­mas progress through time, in relation to earlier and later they are called dif­ferently. For example, one woman can be both a mother and a daughter.C. Analyzing which o f the four traditions is best26cd The third is best, because the timesAre there presented through their action.The first tradition is subsumed within the non-Buddhist Samkhya tradition because it says that dharmas completely transform. In the second, since every­thing has the characteristics of all the times, the times would get mixed up. The fourth is illogical as well, since at any one time all three times would be present. Therefore of all these traditions, the third, transforming state, is the best position, because the times o f past and so forth are there presented through or in terms of their action. Any dharma that has not yet performed its action is future. W hen it is doing its action, it is present. W hen the action is done and ceased, it is past, so it is heard.(b) Rebutting criticism. This has two points.A. The criticism27a-c They’d block. W hat’s it? N ot different,N ot logical as time. If they Exist, why don’t they arise and perish?They, the two times, would block the action from happening because they have action and exist substantially. Additionally, w hat is it, so-called action— is it different from time or not? If it is different from time, then it is noncom ­pound, and so action would be permanent. However, if it is not different, all the times would have action, so it would not be logical for the action not to be performed in the past and the future times as well.If the action exists, then it is not separate from time, but in the two times406"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE KERNELSthe action has not arisen or it has destroyed, so it does not exist, you say. That also does not make sense. If you propose that just as they are in the present, they, actions, also exist in the other two times, one must ask why do they not arise and perish in them? It would follow that action should not be arisen and should have perished in the present.B. Its rebuttal27d So deep are the natures of dharmas.The Great Exposition says that the past and future must exist. To those who cannot be convinced, they say, “So deep are the natures, the inherent essences, o f dharmas, which without a doubt are not the sphere of sophists.”(3) Discarded yet possessed. This has two points.(a) Discards of seeing28ab Suffering is seen, they’ve been discarded;Still other universals bind them.W hen one has discarded a thing, has it been removed— that is, is one free of it?

This has three points.A. Which cognitions focus on those on the level of Desire29. Those of Desire, discards of seeingSuffering and cause, of meditation,Are in the sphere of their own three,O f one of Form, of stainless, too.In order to easily understand with few words how many kernels develop through focus on the different classes of things, this is taught in brief. To briefly categorize all dharmas that are objects, there are the five classes of discards in each of the three realms plus undefiled dharmas, for a total of sixteen classes. The perceiving subjects, cognitions, are likewise also sixteen. The word cogni­tion is used as an illustration— it includes all the concurrences.Among these, those of Desire that are discards of seeing suffering and its cause, the origin, and those which are discards of the path, m editation— three dharmas— are in the sphere o f the five subjects each: their own three cogni­tions of Desire, of one virtuous cognition, the preparation for the first dhyana included within m editation discards of the Form realm, and also the con­sciousness that is compatible with stainless dharma knowing.B.

They are the objects of the three of their own cognitions in the Form realm, three from the lower Desire realm— the two universals of dissimilar status and virtuous discards of meditation— one cognition from the preparation for Infinite Space from the higher Formless, and the consciousness that is compatible with stainless subsequent knowing, too.408"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE KERNELSC.

Thus they are the sphere of ten cognitions.c. Classifications of what has the kernels32ab Two ways the afflicted can have kernels;The unafflicted, through development.If the fifteen dharmas and cognitions are put forth as defiled, do they have kernels only through the development of the kernels? you ask. First of all, it is presented that there are two ways or reasons by which the afflicted cogni­tions can have kernels. W hen their companions, the kernels, have not been abandoned, the kernels develop in them, so they are presented as having the kernels. Kernels that have been abandoned do not develop in but do coexist with afflicted minds, which are thus presented as having those kernels.If the kernels have been abandoned, how can they coexist with an afflicted mind? you ask. W hen abandoning the kernels, they are not separated from the afflicted m ind and then discarded. Instead they are abandoned together409"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA Vwith it. Since this merely makes it so that they will not arise in the future, they still coexist in the period of the past, it is said.All defilements of the unafflicted minds, such as defiled virtue, are presented as having them, the kernels, through the development of the kernels through focus.2. How the kernels arise. This has two points.a. The order in which they arise32cd O ut of delusion, doubt; from that,Wrong view, then personality.33. From that, extreme, then overesteemingDiscipline, overesteeming view.For ones own view, there’s pride, attachment,And hate for others, in this order.First out o f total delusion about the truths comes doubt, and then from hear­ing or contemplating wrongly, w rong view arises. From that denial of the selfless nature of the aggregates then comes the view of personality. From that comes holding the extremes of oneself as permanent or ceasing, and then, from that extreme view, comes the belief in the purifying power of discipline and austerities, the view of overesteeming discipline and austerities, and then overesteeming that inferior view itself. Next, for one s own view, there is pride and attachm ent that arise, and out of excessive attachment to one’s own view, there is hate for others. Thus they arise in this order.b. The causes of their arising34. The kernels being not abandoned,The object being present near,And inappropriate attentionFulfill the causes of afflictions.There are three principal causes that produce the afflictions: The kernels being n ot abandoned— if one has not severed the attainment of the origin of the kernels, they have not been abandoned; the object that is compatible with the arising of the afflictions being present near; and by the immediate condition of being mistaken about the appearance of the object, inappropriate attention.410"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE KERNELSThese produce the afflictions. These three are the power of cause, object, and training. These fulfill the principal causes o f the afflictions.However, they do not necessarily all have to be fulfilled, because from the power of the object alone arhats can regress, it is heard. The Sutra school is skeptical of this: it says that arhats cannot regress from abandonment.3. Enumeration of the kernels. This has three topics: a. The actual enumer­ation, b.

This has two points.411"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VA. Identifying the character base35cd In Form and Formless, kernels alone Are the defilements of existence.In Form and in Formless, excluding ignorance, there are the twelve views, four doubts, five desires, and five prides for twenty-six that function in Form and also twenty-six that function in Formless. These fifty-two kernels alone are the defilements of existence.B. The reason the two higher realms' are defilements of existence36ab Since they are neutral and look inward O n levels of equipoise, they’re one.Since they, the kernels of both of the higher realms are neutral, and since they do not primarily act on an object but mainly engage by looking inward, and since they are on levels of equipoise, for those three comparable reasons they are combined into one and called the defilements of existence.(iii) The reason ignorance is taught separately as a defilement36cd The root is ignorance, so itIs taught as a separate defilement.T he root of the defilements of Desire, etc., and of samsara is ignorance, so it is especially harmful. For that reason, the fifteen types of ignorance of the three realms are taught as a separate defilement.(b) Floods and yokes37. The floods and yokes are like that, too,But views are separate, since they’re sharp.N ot as defilements— without helpers,They do not tend to put, it’s claimed.T he floods number four: except for the views, the defilements of Desire are the floods of Desire. The defilements of existence themselves are the floods of existence. There are the floods of views and the floods of ignorance. The yokes should be known like that, too. But the views are by nature full knowing, so they are taught separately as floods and yokes since they are sharp, it is heard. W hy are they not taught as separate defilements? you ask. The views are not taught as separate defilements, as the meaning of defilement is “that which412"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE KERNELSputs one in samsara,” but w ithout helpers, the views are sharp so they do not tend to p u t one into samsara. The aside “it is claimed” is said in order to teach that ignorance should not be taught as a separate floods or yoke because it is also stable and unclear, explains Purnavardhana.Thus there are twenty-nine floods of Desire, twenty-eight of existence, thirty-six of views, and fifteen of ignorance. The first is the fifteen floods of desire, anger, and pride; four types of doubt; and ten entanglers for a total of twenty-nine. The second is five types each of desire and pride for each of the two realms plus eight types of doubt for a total of twenty-eight. The third is twelve views for each of the three realms, or thirty-six. The fourth is the fifteen types of ignorance of the three realms. The yokes are the same.(c) Grasping38. Those just explained and ignorance,W ith views divided into two,Are grasping. Ignorance produces No clinging, and it is combined.Among those just explained, the twenty-nine substances of the yokes of Desire and the five types of ignorance, or thirty-four substances only, are grasping at Desire: five each of desire, anger, pride, and ignorance; four doubts; and ten entanglers. The thirty-eight substances of the floods of existence, including ignorance, are grasping at belief in a self: five each of desire, pride, and igno­rance for each higher realm; and eight doubts. However, it is not that this does not make four247 because the views are divided into the two of grasping at views and grasping at discipline and austerity.Grasping at discipline and austerity has one each for both suffering and path in each of the three realms, for a total of six. W hy are these pulled out separately from view? you ask. They are enemies of the path and deceive both householders and those who have gone forth, so they are taught separately as grasping.Well then, why is ignorance explained as combined with the other graspings and not taught separately? you ask. The reason for this is because the meaning of grasping is clinging to existence, but unmixed ignorance is not strong and produces no clinging to existence, and it, mixed ignorance, is combined with the afflictions other than view and taught as grasping.(2) Explaining terms. This has two points.413"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA V(a) Explaining the meaning of kernels39.

Since they are subtle causes or engagements, since they are connected with attainment, since they develop in two ways through focus and concurrence, and since until they are discarded they pursue not secretly but manifestly, be­cause of these four reasons, they are explained to be the kernels.

This has three topics: (i) Explaining the nine fetters, (ii) Those which lead to the lowest, and (iii) Those which lead to the higher.(i) Explaining the nine fetters. This has three points.A. Identifying the nine fetters From a sutra:The fetters are nine: the fetters of greed, anger, pride, ignorance, view, holding supreme, doubt, jealousy, and stinginess.B. The reason that views are divided into two different fetters41 cd Alike in substance, overesteeming,The two views are a separate fetter.Among the fetters, why are three views taught separately as the fetter of view and two views taught separately as the fetter of holding supreme? you ask. The first three and last two views are alike in having eighteen substances each, and because the last two views overesteem the first three— the first three are what is overesteemed and the last two are similar in overesteeming the inferior— so the latter two views are said to be a separate fetter from the first three.C. The reason jealousy and stinginess are explained separately as fetters42. Since they are both nonvirtuous only,And are autonomous, its taught That jealousy and stinginessAre fetters separate from those.Among the eight entanglers, why are jealousy and stinginess explained as sep­arate fetters? you ask. Since they, jealousy and stinginess, are both nonvirtuous only and, as they are concurrent only with ignorance, autonom ous, it is415"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA Vtaught that jealousy and stinginess only are fetters separate from those— theother six entanglers— which are not like that.(ii) Those which lead to the lowest. This has two points.A. Actual43a—c There are five that lead to the lowest.The two prevent transcendence of Desire. The three will send one back.The sutras explain that there are five fetters that lead to the lowest: personality view, overesteeming discipline and austerity, doubt, pleasure seeking, and mal­ice. Lowest means the lowest of the three realms, the Desire realm: the inferior is indicated by the word “lowest.” These five are precursors to that.Because they are consistent with Desire, the two guards of pleasure-seeking and malice prevent one from transcending the prison of Desire. If the guards are careless and one should escape, the three of personality view and so forth will send one back.The M ind Only school says that the first three lead to the lowest of sentient beings, ordinary individuals, and the latter two lead to the lowest of the realms, the Desire realm.B. Dispelling a doubt43d The three include the gates and roots.44. N ot having any desire to go,Wrong path, and doubt about the path Prevent one from arriving atLiberation, so these three are taught.W hy is it that when stream-enterers have discarded all the discards of seeing without exception, they are said to have only abandoned personality view, overesteeming discipline and austerity, and doubt? you ask.These three are taught to include the gates and the roots of the afflictions discarded by seeing. The gates of the afflictions are onefold, twofold, and four­fold. Personality view includes one gate, discards of seeing suffering. Over­esteeming includes the two outside gates, discards of seeing suffering and path. D oubt includes all four, discards of seeing the four truths.The Master explains that these teach the blocks to discard that prevent416"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE KERNELSstream-enterers from entering liberation. In order, they are inherently not hav­ing any desire to go to liberation, entering the w rong path, and doubt about path. These three alone prevent one from arriving at liberation, so these three are taught as an illustration of the primary obstacles.(¡¡i) Those that lead to the higher45a-c There are just five that lead to higher:The two desires of Form and Formless,Excitement, pride, delusion, too.Just as the Bhagavan explained that five fetters that lead to the lowest, there are just five fetters that are explained to lead to the higher Form and Form­less— the two desires o f Form and Formless, excitement, pride, and delusion or ignorance, too— because without discarding them one cannot transcend the higher realms.(b) Bonds45d Three bonds by force of the three feelings.The three bonds of desire, hatred, and delusion develop toward pleasant, un­pleasant, and neutral feelings by the force of the three feelings.

The rest in Desire.Both deceit and pretense are in Desire and on the first two dhyanas. W hen noble AsVajit asked Great Brahma where the four sources cease, even though he did not know, Brahma replied saying, “I am Brahma, I am Great Brahma.” As Brahma tried to delude Asvajit with such inappropriate answers as these, there is pretense, which also proves that there is deceit.Torpor, excitement, and arrogance are in three realms. Excluding those three, pretense, and deceit, the rest— the eleven that remain— arise in the Desire realm only.b. What the kernels are concurrent with. This has two topics: i.

Their nourishm ent is lethargy, displeasure, yawning, the heaviness of undigested food, and depression. Their action is to depress the mind. Likewise, the anti­dote for both excitement and regret is tranquility.

W hat distances one from what has been discarded, and E. Teaching that the abandonm ent is attained over and over.A. How they are discarded. This has two points.1. How discards of seeing are abandoned60a-c By knowing the focus perfectly,Extinguishing what focuses O n that, and discarding the focus.There are three ways that discards of seeing are abandoned. They are discarded by knowing the focus perfectly, by extinguishing the afflicted subject that fo­cuses on that, and by discarding the focus.The first method discards the first two classes, discards of seeing suffering and origin of all three realms, with the exception of the nine universals that focus on higher realms, or thirty-eight kernels. It also discards the twelve types o f wrong view and doubt of the three realms discarded by seeing cessation and path, for a total of fifty kernels. In addition, it discards the portion of the six ignorances from those two classes that focuses on the undefiled and the portion of the nine universals of Desire that focuses on its own level. Just as knowing something is a scarecrow blocks the perception of it as a human, these kernels are discarded by simply seeing the actual characteristics of the four truths.The second method discards the portion of the nine universals of Desire that focus on higher realms. Even though one does not know the truths of the higher realms, when the subject that focuses on these truths, the universals of same status of the kernels’ own level, is extinguished, they are blocked.The third method discards all twenty-three discards of seeing cessation and424"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"WHAT DISCARDS THE KERNELSpath that focus solely on the defiled, and the portion of their six ignorances that focus on the defiled. W hen their focus, the subjects of the undefiled, are discarded, they have no objects, so they also do not arise.These three methods of discarding happen at the same time with separate isolates: there is no order of earlier or later.2. How discards of meditation are abandoned60d Extinguished by the anti’s birth.The discards of meditation in one’s own being are extinguished not by com­pletely knowing the focus and so forth. Rather, the nine lesser, medium, and so forth discards are extinguished by the nine lesser, medium, and so forth antidotes’ birth. They are discarded by severing the attainment of the essence. Those in others’ beings are discarded through becoming free of the desire of interest, because one does not have the attainment of them and because when the afflictions in one’s own being have been discarded through severing the attainment, they will also be abandoned.B. Classifications of the antidotes that discard6la-c There are four types of antidotes:Discarding, base, and distancing,Disgust, so called.There are four types o f antidotes: the discarding antidote, the path of no ob­stacles that completely severs the attainment of the discard; the base antidote, the path of liberation consolidates the abandonment; and the distancing an­tidote, the distinctive path distances one from what has been discarded; and the antidote of disgust, so called, which is any path that sees a realm as defi­cient and creates disgust.C. What they are divided from and discarded6 led Afflictions areDiscarded through their focus, it’s said.W hen the afflictions are discarded, what are they proposed to be discarded through? you ask. They cannot be divided from the concurrences, because they cannot be detached from their own group. Therefore the afflictions are to be discarded through their focus, it is said, because if that is discarded they cannot arise through a focus on it.425"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VD. What distances one from what has been discardedThrough different characteristics, and Through incompatibility,Through separate place and time, like distance O f sources, discipline, region, times.There are four ways of being distant: being far apart through having different characteristics even within one assemblage; being far apart through being in­compatible with the antidote; being far apart through separate places, and being far apart in time. In order, these are like the distance of the four sources, the distance between immorality and discipline, the distance between the two regions of east and west, or, in the Treatises explanation, the distance between the two times of past and future.E. Teaching that the abandonment is attained over and over63. They are extinguished once. Removal Is then attained again and again O n birth of anti, attaining the Results, refining faculties.Is the attainm ent of the removal of abandonment by the previously explained methods of discarding only caused by abandoning the discards with the anti­dote? you ask. It is not. W hen the antidotes have discarded what they aban­don, those are extinguished once. Their removal is then attained again and again, becoming better. It improves in this way upon the birth of the antidote, the path of liberation; upon attaining the four results of the spiritual way;254 and upon refining faculties from dull to sharp. This is a total of six instances. This teaches all of the causes for obtaining improved attainments of removal.III. The results of discarding the kernels. This has five topics: A.

It is not. There are nine perfect knowings of abandonment. Firstly, in the realm of Desire, upon exhausting the first two discards by seeing suffering and origin, there is one perfect knowing. In the Desire realm only, upon exhausting two discards by seeing cessation and path, there are two per­fect knowings, one each, for a total of three perfect knowings in Desire. And just as there are three perfect knowings of the abandonment of discards of see­ing in Desire, likewise there are just those three above in Form and Formless: the first upon abandoning those discarded by seeing suffering and origin, the second upon abandoning those discarded by seeing cessation, and the third upon abandoning the discards of seeing the path. Thus the abandonment of the discards of seeing of the three realms is six perfect knowings.O n the path of meditation, there is one perfect knowing of the abandon­ment of the discards that lead to the lowest. It is called by that term because it has extinguished all the defilements of the Desire realm. In the abandonment of the defilements of Form, there is the perfect knowing of the extinction of desire for Form, its primary fetter. And the extinction o f all defilements is also one: the perfect knowing of the total elimination of all fetters. Thus there are three more perfect knowings on the path of meditation.B. Which perfect knowings are the result of what. This has three points.1.

Which are the results of what levels66. They re all results of N ot Unable.Five of the dhyanas, or else eight.The one is of the preparations;One of three actual Formless, too.They, the nine perfect knowings, are all results of the preparations for the first dhyana, N ot Unable, as that level can act as the antidote for all discards:Undefiled N ot Unable canRemove attachment to all levels.256In the tradition of the Great Exposition, there are five perfect knowings that are results o f the actual dhyana: the three of the abandonment of the discards of seeing of the two higher realms and the latter two perfect knowings of the abandonm ent of discards of meditation of the two realms. If on the basis of the dhyanas, nonreturners previously detached produce the path of seeing, they attain the three perfect knowings of the abandonm ent of the two higher realms’ discards of seeing, and when they produce the path of meditation, they also attain the last two perfect knowings. The four perfect knowings of the abandonm ent of Desire’s discards have already been attained earlier by the level of N ot Unable, so they are not attained, they say.The phrase “or else” indicates the position of Venerable Ghosaka. According to him, if nonreturners previously detached produce the path of seeing on the actual practice of dhyana, the three isolates of the perfect knowings of the abandonment of Desire’s discards of seeing are individually obtained at that time, so there are eight results of the dhyanas. They also, of course, obtain the isolate of the perfect knowing of the abandonment of that which leads to the lowest, but that is only attained incidentally with the perfect knowing of the abandonm ent of the higher realms’ discards of seeing the path, so it is not counted separately, he says.O f the Formless, there is one perfect knowing that is a result o f the pre­parations for Infinite Space: the extinction of desire for Form. That is a worldly path, but only nobles are presented as having perfect knowings as result, so it is possible to attain undefiled removal. The one perfect knowing of the total elimination of all fetters is the only result o f three undefiled actual Formless, too.428"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"THE RESULTS OF DISCARDING THE KERNELS3.

How they are possessed by individuals69. N ot one. Those on the path of seeing May possess fully up to five.Those on the path of meditation May possess six or one or two.70ab They are combined when one becomesDetached from realms or gains a result.Ordinary individuals do n ot have even one perfect knowing, because they do not have any undefiled attainment of removal. Those nobles on the path of seeing do not possess any up through the fifth moment, but may possess fully one from the sixth moment, two from the eighth, three from the tenth, four from the twelfth, and up to five on the fourteenth and fifteenth moments.257Those nobles on the path o f m editation who are attached or who have re­gressed from detachment may possess the first six, or if they have previously been or later become detached from Desire, they possess the one perfect know­ing of the abandonment of that which leads to the lowest.

Arhats possess the last, single perfect knowing of the exhaustion of all defilements.W hy are nonreturners who are not detached from Form and arhats pre­sented as having one perfect knowing? you ask. The reason for that is they, the individual abandonments, are com bined w hen one becomes detached from a realm or has newly gained a result. W hen these two are combined, the individual attainments of removal for each abandonment are forfeited and a single one is acquired, so the individual abandonments are combined and presented as a single perfect knowing.430"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"THE RESULTS OF DISCARDING THE KERNELSE.

Nonreturners who are detached from Form forfeit two if they regress from detachment from Desire. Nonreturners previ­ously detached forfeit five when abiding in subsequent knowing of path, or some forfeit six in instances when the successive nonreturner258 has gradually detached himself from Desire.Likewise, there can be attainm ent of one, two, or six, but five cannot be gained, because it is impossible to regress from the state of a previously de­tached nonreturner.

W ith regards to that abandonment, it is taught above that afflictions of the kernels are dis­carded by seeing truth, the path of seeing, and by m editating on the truths, the path of meditation. Here it is those paths that abandon that are explained.B. The essence of the paths1 cd The path of meditation is twofold,But seeing, so called, is undefiled.W hich of those paths are defiled and which are undefiled? you ask. The path o f m editation is twofold: the defiled worldly path and the undefiled transworldly path. But the path of seeing, so called, is transworldly u n ­defiled only, because it is the antidote for all three realms including the Peak of Existence, because it discards the nine sets of discards of seeing o f the three realms at one time, and because the worldly paths do not have such power to discard.C. The focus of the paths. This has two topics: 1. Explaining the four truths, and 2. Explaining the two truths.1. Explaining the four truths. This has three points.a. Essence2a The truths are four, it is explained.T he truths m entioned in the line, “By seeing truth,” are four, it is explained. The line “The undefiled is the truth of path”260 explicitly teaches the truth of the path. The line “Cessation that is analytic”261 explains the truth of cessation. The line “They’re suffering, origin, and the w orld... ”262 explains the truths o f suffering and origin.b. Order2b—d Thus suffering and origin,Cessation and the path. This isThe order in which they are realized.Is that the only order in which they must be known? you ask. It is not. Well then, what is the order? you ask. Thus they are the truths of suffering and434"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF THE PATHSorigin, cessation and the path. This is the order. The word “thus” means that their essences are just as has been already described. They are presented in the order in which they are realized, because on the path of seeing, one clearly realizes duhkha first and then origin, cessation, and path. The reason for that is that on the paths of accumulation and joining, the truths are fully realized in that order. For example, when you see illness, you think of its cause, and then out of the desire to eliminate the illness you look for the method, which is medicine. Because only nobles see the truths from suffering to path as some­thing that is just as it is, they are called the noble truths. Because ordinary in­dividuals see the truths and so forth incorrectly, they are not called ordinary individuals’ truths.c. Elaboration3. The attractive and the unattractive,And the defiled other than those Are suffering without exceptionBecause they have three sufferings.There are three types of suffering: the attractive are the suffering of change, and the unattractive are the suffering of suffering, and the defiled other than those two are the suffering of formation. Everything defiled w ithout exception is suffering due to any one of the three sufferings, because they, the defiled composites, have the three sufferings.The three of attractive and so forth appear in an order that is compatible with the three feelings, so pleasant feeling is the suffering through change. From a sutra: “Pleasant feeling is pleasant when it arises. It is pleasant while it stays. W hen it changes, it is suffering.” Unpleasant is by its very nature suffer­ing. From a sutra: “The feeling of suffering is suffering when it arises. It is suf­fering while it stays.” Feeling that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant is manifestly formed by conditions so it is suffering only through formation, be­cause it is said, “Whatever is impermanent is suffering.”2. Explaining the two truths4. If not engaged by mind when it’sDestroyed or mentally excluded,It’s relative, like vases or water.Ultimate being is different.43 5"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VIThe sutras teach the four truths, but they also teach relative and ultimate truth. W hat are those two? you ask.If a thing is not engaged by m ind when it is destroyed by a hammer or so forth, or when it is mentally excluded through full knowing, it exists relatively, like vases or water. They are true merely in conventional terms.263Ultimate being or existence is different from such relative things that may be damaged. It is dharmas such as form, subtle particles, instants, and non­composites that the m ind can engage even when they are destroyed or when a dharma is excluded by m ind.264 As that is the highest meaning of wisdom, it is ultimate, and as it is also truth, it is the ultimate truth.The respective characteristics of the two truths are those things that when destroyed or disintegrated the m ind that perceives them is discarded or not discarded.Here the explanation in the Tika o f “permanent subtle particles of sub­stance” means merely that they do not disintegrate through destruction by force; it seems not to mean permanent as in the context of permanent and impermanent, I would think.D. How the paths arise. This has two topics: 1. Aii overview of how to enter the paths, and 2. An explanation of how to meditate.1. An overview of how to enter the paths. This has two points.a. Actual5ab W ith conduct, listening, contemplation,Completely train in meditation.Those who wish to see the truth should first abide in the disciplined conduct of definite renunciation, retain the meaning from listening that is compatible with seeing the truths and then, by knowing the meaning they have listened to, contemplate appropriately. Possessing both of these qualities, then they should completely and unerringly train in the samadhi m editation on the meaning they have contemplated. Contemplation arises from listening, and meditation arises from contemplation.b. The essence of the three full knowings make one enter5cd Full knowing of listening, et cetera,Are subjects of name, both, and meaning.43 6"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF THE PATHSSome members of the Great Exposition say that the natures of the three full knowings born out o f listening, et cetera, contemplation and meditation, are respectively conscious subjects that take the nam e only, both the name and meaning, and the m eaning only as their object, like beginner, intermediate, and expert swimmers grabbing onto a float when learning to swim, it is heard.The Master says that if that is so, there is no contemplation separate from listening or meditation. Therefore he explains that the three are the full know­ings born respectively from credible scriptures, analyzing with logic, and samadhi.2. An explanation of how to meditate. This has two topics: a.

These two, contentm ent and satisfaction, are in the three realms, or they are stainless, for four types. They are both nongreed by nature.iii.

The fourth noble family is joy for being without what has been abandoned and for meditating. This is also nongreed by nature, because it is directed against existence and the desire for existence.The four noble natures explained by the Bhagavan teach both method and action to students who yearn for liberation. O f these, the first three teach the conduct, and the last teaches action. As it says in a sutra, “If you do this action by these methods, before long you will attain liberation.” They are taught as an antidote for the arising o f craving.

If two are counted as one, then it is incomplete, or if one is counted as two, there are extra. If the in-breath is perceived as the out-breath or the out-breath per­ceived as the in-breath, the count is confused: these three faults m ust be avoided.In following the breath, pay attention as the in-breath goes from the throat, heart, navel, and calves down to the feet, and then as the out-breath goes out the nostrils out to a hand’s width or arm span.In placing, consider that it is like a string of jewels from the tip of the nose to the feet that is beneficial and warm.In closely considering, the object of the wind is a form comprised of the eight substances, and the perceiving subject of full knowing includes the four name aggregates, so consider it as the five aggregates.In modifying, the mind that focuses on the breath engages higher and higher along the path as far as supreme dharma, and in completely purifying, up to the path of seeing and so forth. Alternatively, some say that modifying is from the four foundations of mindfulness to vajra-like samadhi, and completely purifying is the knowing of extinction, et cetera.As a summary of these, the autocommentary says:The mindfulness of breathing inAnd breathing out is counting, following,Placing, considering, modifying,And purifying: these six types.B.

M ethod o f meditationl4cd By examining two characteristicsO f body, feeling, mind, and dharmas.The foundations o f mindfulness are known by examining the two specific and general characteristics o f body, feeling, m ind, and dharmas. The specific characteristics of the body are the sources and source-derived; of feeling is ex­perience; of mind is focus; and of dharmas are the conceptions, formations, and noncom pound dharmas other than body, feeling, and mind. The general characteristics are that composites are impermanent; defiled dharmas are suf­fering; and all dharmas are empty and selflessness. The characteristic of suf­fering is incompatibility with the nobles.B. Essence15ab Full knowing from listening, et cetera.The others from connection, focus.The essence of the four foundations of mindfulness is full knowing. From a sutra: “The viewing of body in the body is the foundation of mindfulness.” This is full knowing that is born from listening, et cetera, contemplating and meditating, but not that attained upon birth. The word m indfulness is used because these are produced by the power of mindfulness, or in the Master’s explanation, this simultaneously applies mindfulness, so it is explained as thus.Thus full-knowing is the natural foundation of mindfulness. Its compan­ions, the others that are concurrent with it, from their connection with it are called connected foundations o f mindfulness. T heir focus— body, feeling, mind, and dharmas— are the focus o f both, so they are called the focused foundation of mindfulness. For this reason, a sutra says, “Bhikshus, that which we call all dharmas’ is a synonym for the four foundations of mindfulness.”C. Order15c The order is as they arise,T he order of earlier and later is, according to some from the Great Exposition, the same as the order in which they arise, because the earlier ones are coarser and easier to realize, so that is how they are seen, they say. The Master says it is because on the basis of the body desire arises, which is attached to or m an­ifestly desires feeling, which disturbs the mind, and because of that afflictions are not abandoned.444"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF THE PATHSD. Establishing their quantity15d Four antis for the erroneous.T he body is like feces, so it is unclean. Feelings are suffering. The m ind changes quickly, so it is impermanent. Dharmas have no independent single self, so these four foundations of mindfulness are taught as antidotes for the erroneous ideas of cleanliness, bliss, permanence, and the self. More than that are unnecessary, but fewer would not include everything.(¡¡) The method for meditating on the mindfulness of dharmas in particular16. It is the foundation of dharmasThat focuses on them combined.They view them as impermanent,And suffering, empty, and selfless.Having familiarized oneself with the foundations of mindfulness that focus on body and so forth, it, that familiarization, is the foundation o f dharmas that rests focusing on them in general or combined. They, the yogis, generally combine all the foundations of body and so forth and view them as the four aspects of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and selflessness.(2) The path of joining. This has four topics, (a) How it arises, (b) Essence,(c) Features, and (d) Preliminaries.(a) How it arises.

Just as when you rub two sticks, warmth arises as a sign of forthcoming fire, this is called warmth. It, warmth, has the four truths as its sphere: it focuses on the truths of the higher and lower realms in succession, since it cannot focus on them in a single moment.

Thus it is the near training for the path of seeing, so it is the path of joining in the sense of training. It is meditation w ith the sixteen aspects of impermanence and the others.(ii) Peak. This has two points.A. The actual peak17cd O ut of warmthComes peak, which is like that as well.O u t of the gradual increase of w arm th through the lesser, medium, and greater comes the peak, which is like that, warmth, as well in focus and aspects: it focuses on the four truths and views them as the sixteen aspects. Because it is the peak of unstable roots of virtue, it is called the peak.B. Common features of both warmth and the peak18ab Through dharma, they both aim at aspects,Develop through the others, too.Through the foundation of mindfulness of dharma, they, both warmth and the peak, first aim at and engage the aspects in the four truths. They are also developed or familiarized and refined through the others— those other than the foundation of mindfulness o f dharma— all four foundations of mindfulness.(in) Forbearance. This has two points.A. Actual18cd From that, forbearance. Two like that.Dharmas develops all of them.W hat arises from that development of the lesser, middle, and greater peak is called forbearance. W hen one is childish, one fears for oneself and cannot bear to see the truth. W hen one has attained warmth and the peak, one can bear the lesser and medium truth but one falls away from that. Because at this44 6"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF THE PATHSstage one has great forbearance for seeing the truth without falling away from it at all, it is called forbearance.The two, lesser and middle forbearance, are like that, the peak, in the way they aim at the aspects of the truths. The foundation of mindfulness of dhar- mas develops all o f them , lesser, middle, and greater forbearance. The first two each have individual aims and development, so they are also like that, but greater forbearance is a single instant, so it is not like that. This is said in terms of how it engages the truths. It does not engage them through the other foun­dations because it is near supreme dharma and the path of seeing. Thus it is the mindfulness of dharmas, which is close to those.B. Explaining the particular features of greater forbearance19ab The object of the great is sufferingO f Desire realm. It is one moment.Because it is near supreme dharma, the object o f the greater forbearance is the suffering o f Desire realm: it focuses on that in any one of its four aspects. It is one m om ent; it does not have a continuum.(iv) Supreme dharma19c So is supreme dharma.So is supreme dharma similar to greater forbearance: it focuses on the suffering of Desire and is one moment. It is worldly, but it is the supreme of worldly dharmas, or alternatively its power leads to the path of seeing, which has no cause o f same status, so it is the supreme of all that is worldly. For these reasons, it is called supreme dharma.(v) Common features19cd They are allFive aggregates, without attainments.20 a The four precursors to realizationThey, the four, are all inherently the foundations of mindfulness, so they are primarily full knowing and its associations. They are also equipoise, so they have an imperceptible form. For that reason, they are the five aggregates. They are w ithout attainm ents, which are not included as warmth and the others, because the nobles have the attainments in a manifest way. Otherwise it would447"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VIfollow that nobles would also manifestly have warmth and the others.266 In this way, warmth, the peak, forbearance, and supreme dharma are the four precursors to clear realization.(b) Essence20b Must be produced by meditationAll four of the precursors to clear realization m ust be produced by meditation: they do not arise from listening or contemplating.(c) Features. This has five topics: (i) Distinctions of level, (ii) Distinctions of support, (iii) Distinctions in how they are forfeited, (iv) Distinctions in qual­ities, and (v) Distinctions in family.(i) Distinctions of level20cd O n N ot Unable, special, andThe dhyanas. Two below, perhaps.These are on the levels of the preparation for the first dhyana N ot Unable, the special dhyana, and the four actual practices of the dhyanas, or six levels. As these are contained in those six levels, there are no precursors to clear real­ization on the levels of Formless. This is because clear realization is the practice of the path of seeing, which is not present on the levels of Formless. The reason there is no path of seeing there is because the path of seeing focuses on the Desire realm, and Formless does not focus on the Desire realm.In the tradition of Venerable Ghosaka, the two, warmth and the peak, are also below in the Desire realm. The word “perhaps” indicates that this is a separate tradition in which those two would be on seven levels: the six levels of dhyana and Desire. In that case, since they could be supported on a level of Desire, they would not necessarily be meditation-produced.(ii) Distinctions of support21 ab Support of Desire realm, and womenGain supreme dharma on both supports.The first three can be newly produced in those men and women of the three continents who have not previously had them. Those that have already arisen can become manifest among the gods, and the fourth can be produced among the gods, so they all have the support o f Desire realm, and wom en can gain448"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF THE PATHSsupreme dharm a on both male and female supports.267 Men can only attain it with a male support, because they also attain a nonanalytic cessation of be­coming female.(m) Distinctions in how they are forfeited.

How the Nobles forfeit them21 cd The nobles forfeit them when leaving A level;T he nobles forfeit them , the paths of joining attained on the support of a particular level, when they leave a level and are born in a higher. Because their roots of virtue are greatly increased by the path of seeing, unlike ordinary in­dividuals they do not forfeit them through regression or death.B. How ordinary individuals forfeit them.

Those not detached also forfeit them by discarding their likeness, even when not transmigrating to a new level. T he first two, warmth and the peak, are forfeited during the period of an ordinary individual, by re­gressing, too, through the afflictions that are incompatible with them. Even ordinary individuals cannot regress from forbearance or supreme dharma.2. Elaboration. This has three points.a.

T he explanation o f forfeiture through regression and death is for those on N ot Unable, so there is no con­tradiction.b. How they are re-attained22c If one regresses, gained anew.If one who has regressed from the precursors to clear realization later attains them again, one gains them anew, like the vows of individual liberation. One does not re-attain the same ones previously forfeited, because they are some­thing that is unfamiliar and created through effort.c. The essence o f the two types o f forfeiture22d Both forfeitures are nonpossession.W hat are the natures of forfeiture and regression? you ask. All loss of attain­m ent is called forfeiture, and in particular, forfeiture because of an incompat­ible affliction is called regression. Both forfeitures are in essence nonpossession: nonattainm ent from forfeiting the attainment.(iv) Distinctions in qualities23ab W hen peak is gained, roots can’t be severed;Forbearance goes not to low realms.W hen peak is gained, if one regresses, one might commit heinous misdeeds and go to the lower realms, but the roots of virtue cannot be severed, because one has attained sincere faith in the Three Jewels through training in their qualities. W hen lesser forbearance is attained, there is also the attainm ent of the freedom of not going to lower realms. W hen greater forbearance is at­tained, one also attains freedom from being reborn in certain modes of birth, births, bodies, and so forth.(v) Distinctions in family. This has two points.A. The families that can change23cd Two can withdraw from the learners’ family And become buddhas.

Those other than the Buddha, self-buddhas, on the third stage of the path of joining, forbearance, can also change because they do not go to the lower realms even for others’ benefits. Once supreme dharma has been attained there is no changing family.B. The families that cannot change24ab The Teacher and rhino, all on oneSeat and dhyan’s end until awakening.T he Teacher, the Buddha, and the rhinolike self-buddha cannot change family at any time after reaching warmth, because all the paths from the precursors to clear realization arise on one seat and only on dhyanas upper end, the fourth dhyana, until awakening to enlightenment.(d) Preliminaries24cd Before that, the precursor to freedom.The swiftest in three lives are freed.25ab From listening and contemplation.Three karmas are propelled by humans.Do the precursors to clear realization arise right from the beginning, or must something precede them? you ask. Before that precursor to clear realization, one must produce the virtuous roots of the precursor to freedom.268 T he ab­solutely swiftest of all in three lifetimes are liberated. For example, just as one plants a seed, the fruit forms and the fruit ripens: in the first lifetime one produces the virtuous roots of precursor to liberation, in the second the pre­cursor to realization, and in the third produces the noble path. T he being gradually enters, ripens, and is completely liberated in this dharma.The precursors to liberation arises from listening and contemplation; they do not arise from meditation. They are primarily karma of mind, but because they are embraced by prayers, they are also karma of speech, so they are the three karmas of body, speech, and mind. They are propelled by hum ans of the three continents only, and not by others, who lack either full knowing or world-weariness.45i"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VI(3) The path that directly realizes the truths. This has four topics: (a) How the sixteen moments of cognition arise, (b) Teaching the three types of clear realization, (c) W hich levels support it, and (d) Classifying the cognitions as sixteen.(a) How the sixteen moments of cognition arise25cd From the supreme of worldly dharmasComes undefiled dharma forbearance26. O f suffering of Desire, from which Arises dharma knowing of Just that itself. And likewise for The rest of suffering arises The subsequent forbearance, knowing.Three other truths are like that, too.27ab Thus clear realization of the truths Is sixteen minds.From the supreme o f worldly dharmas, the undefiled dharm a forbearanceimmediately arises. That focuses on suffering o f Desire. It is forbearance for the sake of the dharma knowing of duhkha, so it is called exactly that, like saying “flowering tree” or “fruit tree.” Immediately after or from that forbear­ance, there arises the dharm a knowing o f just that itself, the suffering of De­sire. This is given the designation dharma knowing o f suffering in the Treatise. This is in all respects an undefiled moment, so it is called undefiled dharma knowing.Just as forbearance of dharma knowing of suffering and the dharma know­ing arise, likewise forbearance of subsequent knowing for the rest o f suffering of Form and Formless arises immediately following the dharma knowing of suffering. It focuses on general characteristics and is called the subsequent for­bearance, or the forbearance of subsequent knowing of suffering. Then the so-called subsequent knowing of suffering arises.Just as the four forbearances and knowings of the truth of suffering arise, the four forbearances and knowings of each of the other three other truths of origin, cessation and path arise like that, too. Thus in this way, through this progression, the clear realization of tru th is sixteen moments of mind.452«"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF THE PATHS(b) Teaching the three types of clear realization27bc There are three types,Called seeing, focusing, and action,There are three types of clear realization. Directly realizing the truth with un­defiled full knowing is called the clear realization of seeing. The feelings and so forth that are concurrent with that full knowing and also the full knowing itself focus on the truth, so they are called the clear realization of focusing. The clear realization of the action is knowing, discarding, making manifest, and meditating during the path. It is the five aggregates of a single assembly: discipline that is not concurrent with full knowing, arising and so forth, at­tainment and so forth, and that which is concurrent with full knowing. This is because these all perform those actions. Thus there are said to be three clear realizations of truth.(c) Which levels support it27d O n the same level as supreme.The sixteen cognitions of clear realization explained above are on the same level as supreme dharma. These are the six levels explained earlier.269(d) Classifying the cognitions as sixteen. This has two points.(i) Classifying them as paths of no obstacles and paths of liberation28ab Respectively, forbearance, knowing are Paths of no obstacles and liberation.Respectively the eight forbearances and eight knowings here are, presented in this order, the paths o f no obstacles that discard the four classes of discards of Desire and the four classes of discards contained in the higher realms and the paths of liberation, for a total of sixteen.(ii) Explaining the term path of seeing28cd From seeing the unseen, fifteenMoments of these are the path of seeing.These sixteen cognitions are not all the path of seeing.

Explaining the four pairs of individuals. This has three topics: 1. Explain­ing entering stream-enterer, 2. Explaining those previously detached, and3. Explaining successive results.1. Explaining entering stream-enterer. This has two points.a. Classifications of mind29ab During these, sharp and dull faculties Are followers of faith and dharma.D uring the period when they are abiding in these fifteen moments of the path of seeing, the two types of individuals with sharp and dull faculties are called, if of dull faculties, followers o f faith and if o f sharp faculties, followers of dharma. This is because those of dull faculties clearly realize the truth because of the spiritual advice of other masters during their previous period as ordinary individuals, whereas those of sharp faculties did not rely on other masters dur­ing their previous time as ordinary individuals. They realize the meaning of the scriptures on their own through full knowing and clearly realize the truth.b.

Entering and abiding in arhat.a. Entering and abiding in stream-enterer. This has two topics: i. Entering, and ii. Abiding.i. Entering. Entering has already been taught above.ii. Abiding. This has (1) General teaching, and (2) Individual explanations.(1) General teaching. This has two points.(a) Teaching that the mere abider in result is not an enterer32. To gain a result is not to gainThe path of higher progress. Thus Those dwelling in result, not striving To improve it, are not enterers.W hen stream-enterers have abandoned the fifth discard and are on the six­teenth cognition, why are they not entering the result of once-returner? you ask. At that time, they have gained a mere result of stream-enterer, but that is no t to gain the path o f higher progress. T hus those stream-enterers are dwelling in result, not striving to attain the second result that improves it. Those who are not making efforts to attain a result are not enterers in that result.By this logic one can also know the reason why someone who has aban­doned the eighth discard of Desire and abides on the sixteenth m om ent is not called entering the result of nonreturner, and the reason why someone who is detached from Nothingness and abides on the sixteenth m om ent is not en­tering the result of arhat.45 6"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUALS(b) Classifications of the path of enterer and discards of meditation33.

Likewise, in the same way as the faults, each of the levels also has nine sets of qualities— the antidotes, the paths of no obstacles— and also the paths of liberation. This is because the lesser and so forth, middle, and greater of lesser— the lesser, middle, and greater of middle, and the lesser, middle, and greater of greater— are all separate. The lesser of lesser path discards the greater of greater afflictions, and the greater of greater path discards the lesser of lesser afflictions. This is because at the very beginning the greater path is impossible and when the greater path arises, the greater afflictions are impossible.(2) Individual explanations. This has two topics: (a) Seven-timer, and(b) From family to family.(a) Seven-timer. This has two points.(i) Ascertaining the seven-timer34ab Those dwelling in result without discarding any Through meditation, at most seven times.Those who dwell in a result w ithout discarding any of Desire realm s afflic­tions which are discarded through meditation, if they reach the uppermost limit, will be reborn in at most seven more lives— they are a seven-timer. Since not all stream-enterers are seven-timers, this is the lowest of all results.Stream-enterers are so called because they have entered the stream of the path to nirvana.Some proponents of the Great Exposition say that “seven more lifetimes” means seven more births each in the prior state of gods and the prior state of humans plus their between states, for twenty-eight, but as they are similar in having sets of seven, it is called “seven times.” It is like for example calling a plant seven leaved, they say. Others say it is seven rebirths combining the re­births as gods and humans. The noble Masters explanation is consistent with the former.457"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VIWell then, does this not contradict The Sutra o f Many Realms,27° which states:There is no occasion and no opportunity for an indi­vidual with excellent view to produce an eighth exis­tence. There is no place for that.It is not contradictory, because this is about not producing existence in one class of beings in Desire. Otherwise it would be impossible to die and be re­born in all places.271(ii) The family of seven-timersSeven-timer is the longest, but it is possible to make nirvana manifest before the seventh birth. Additionally, ordinary individuals on the paths of accumu­lation and joining whose beings have been ripened are also seven-timers.(b) From family to family34cd Those freed from three or four, with two or three More lives, from family to family.Those stream-enterers who have three causes— in terms of discarding, being freed from three or four of the afflictions; in terms of faculties, attainm ent of their antidote, the undefiled faculties; and in terms of birth, with two or three more lifetimes remaining— are stream-enterers who are born from family to family.b.

It is possible that they will be reborn once more in Desire, but twice or more is impossible.(2) Distinctive abiding in result36ab W hen they have extinguished seven or eight Classes of faults, one life, one obstacle.The distinction in terms of abandonm ent is that they who are abiding in the result of once-returner have extinguished the seventh or eighth class o f faults of Desire that are discarded by meditation and have attained the undefiled path that is its antidote. The distinction in terms of birth is that they have one intervening lifetime before attaining nirvana. Alternatively, they have only one aspect of affliction preventing them from attaining the result of nonre­turner. Thus for that reason, they are called one lifetime, one obstacle.This is explained to rebut the doubt that the three lesser afflictions together make one take rebirth in Desire, but perhaps only one or two might not have that power to cause rebirth. The reason that one set of afflictions cannot pre­vent the attainment of the result of once-returner in this lifetime but can pre­vent the attainment of nonreturner is that for the former one does not need to transcend the Desire realm, but for the latter one does.c.

By their dharma nature, they do not remain long in the between state, and as they do not have the afflictions of birth, they immediately enter the state without remainder.The second passes into nirvana with remainder not long after birth in Form because of effort and the path appearing naturally.The third makes efforts, but the path does not appear naturally, so they pass into nirvana with effort a somewhat long time after taking birth.The fourth attains nirvana without effort, but not immediately after birth:460"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUALSthey do not actually make efforts, but the path appears naturally, so they pass into complete nirvana without great efforts.The fifth does not make efforts and the path does not appear naturally.

Those who attain nirvana immediately after birth are not asserted to attain it without remainder, because those who have not attained the highest end of dhyana272 on the support of a hum an body on the three continents do not have the power to cast off life, and the karma that makes one remain in the previous state is also very strong.As for the order they are presented, the sutras explain nirvana without effort before nirvana with effort, and the Master also explains it thus. The Great Ex­position, however, says that as their path arises naturally, if they are mentioned first there would be no distinction between them and those who pass into nir­vana immediately upon birth, and so list it later.(ii) Particular explanation of the classifications of those bound for higher.This has two points.A. Those who will go to Below None37cd If they alternateThe dhyanas, they are bound for Below None.38ab They leap, half leap, or die in all The realms,There are two types of those bound for higher in terms of cause and result. In terms of cause, there are those who train in insight and those who train in tranquility. If they alternate the defiled and undefiled dhyanas and meditate mixing them, those who train insight are ultimately bound to go as far as Below N one in terms of result. They are also threefold: leapers, half leapers, or those who die in all the realms.A leaper is someone who alternates dhyanas as a hum an but regresses through the afflictions of the first dhyana and is reborn in Brahmas Abode, et cetera. There they meditate on the great alternation, and so are born in Below None, where they make nirvana manifest.A half leaper is unable to produce the great alternation in Brahmas Abode and so forth and meditates only on the lesser or medium alternation.

Those who will go to the Peak of Existence38b and others go to the Peak.Those other than the ones who alternate the dhyanas and go to Below None are those who enjoy tranquility and neither meditate on alternation nor go to Below None. They go from the first dhyana through all levels with the exception of the fourth dhyanas pure abodes and ultimately to the Peak of Existence. They can also be similar to leapers and so forth. They do go to the Formless realms later, but since they first go to the dhyanas, they are called bound for Form.Can they pass into nirvana in the meantime? you ask. It is possible. Here Below None and the Peak of Existence are taken as the upper limit, but there can be attainm ent of nirvana without going to them, similar to the seven- timers, it is explained.These are nobles who prefer samadhi and train in tranquility. The former who are ultimately bound for Below None prefer full knowing and train in insight.(b) Explanation of those bound for Formless38c Four other types are bound for Formless.Additionally there are four other types, different from the previously explained nonreturners, who have attained the m ind of Formless in Desire and not re­gressed. They are the four types bound for Formless. There is no between state, so they are the four types of nirvana upon birth and so on. It is also suit­able to give them the designations of leaper and so on. Thus this is the sixth type of nonreturner.(c) Explanation of visible peace38d Another transcends sorrow here.A nother nonreturner, different from those bound for Form and Formless, transcends sorrow by attaining nirvana here in the Desire realm itself in the462"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUALSvery same lifetime as they attain nonreturner. This is the seventh nonreturner, called visible peace.Thus the five bound for Form can each be born in the sixteen abodes, with the exception of Great Brahma.

The four bound for Formless have four supports, six families, nine detach­ments, and three faculties, which when multiplied makes 2,592 bound for Formless. Visible peace has nine supports, six families, seventy-two detach­ments, and three faculties, which when multiplied makes 11,664 who are visible peace.(d) Explaining the many classifications of nonreturners. This has four topics:(i) Classifying those bound for Form as nine, (ii) Explaining the holy wan­derers, (iii) Identifying nobles whose lives have been completely transformed, and (iv) Methods for meditating on alternation of the dhyanas.(i) Classifying those bound for Form as nine. This has two points.A. Actual39ab Dividing the three in three more,Nine bound for Form can be explained,Dividing the three nonreturners who achieve nirvana in the between state, upon birth, and bound for higher in three more each, the nine bound for Form can be explained. The way they are classified is that the first category has those who attain nirvana quickly, not quickly, and after a long time. The second category has those who attain nirvana immediately after birth, with effort, and without effort. The third category has leapers, half-leapers, and those who die in all realms. Alternatively it is explained that it is possible to classify all three as those who attain nirvana quickly, not quickly, and after a long time.B. Their distinctions39cd Distinguished by their different Karma, afflictions, faculties.The nine are distinguished by their different karma, afflictions, and faculties.They are individually classified through karma that produces manifest results, that is experienced on rebirth, or that is experienced in other lifetimes; through463"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA VIlesser, medium, and greater afflictions that are harder or easier to discard; and through faculties that are sharp, medium, or dull.(ii) Explaining the holy wanderers. This has two points.A. Actual40ab W ithout dividing those bound higher,There are seven holy wanderers,The seven holy wanderers taught in the sutras are the three who pass into nir­vana in the intermediate, three who pass into nirvana upon birth and w ithout dividing those bound for the higher, one bound for the higher. Thus there are seven holy wanderers, it is proposed. Purnavardhana explains that the rea­son for not dividing those bound for higher is its classifications are so confus­ing. The Prince explains that it depends upon the disciples’ interests.B. Elaboration40cd They act on holy, not unholy;They go without return, so holy.W hy are only these, and not the attached learner stream-enterers and once- returners, presented as holy wanderers? you ask. Between the two types, holy and unholy beings, they, the former, only act upon virtuous, holy conduct, whereas the latter merely do n ot act on the nonvirtuous or unholy. This is the meaning o f holy. They are also called holy from going to the higher realms w ithout return either to that or a lower level. That is the meaning of wanderer. So therefore only the nonreturners are holy. Because the learners who are stream-enterers and once-returners do not fulfill those two criteria, they are not.However, it says in a sutra:W hat is a holy being? you ask. One who has the correct view of the learners...Additionally, attached learners have attained vows to never do five mis­deeds and have mostly discarded nonvirtue, for which reason they are quali- fiedly holy. Here the explanation is for the unqualifiedly holy, so there is no contradiction.464"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUALS(iii) Identifying nobles whose lives have been completely transformed. This has two points.A. Actual4 lab Nobles who in Desire transformTheir lives don’t go to other realms.Are there such classifications of the nobles whose lives are completely trans­formed in Desire? you ask. There are not. Well, what are they like? you ask. Nobles who in Desire completely transform their lives do not go to other realms, because in that very life they attain the result of nonreturner and then completely pass into nirvana.Those whose lives are completely transformed in the Form realm can also enter into the Formless realms, such as those bound for higher that are going to the Peak of Existence.Well then, a sutra says:Sakra said, “If after I die here, I am born as a human and attain nirvana, that would be excellent. If I do not attain nirvana then, may I then be reborn in Below None.”W hat does this mean? The Great Exposition says that Sakra merely does not know the abhidharma and the Teacher did not refute him in order to please him.B. Dharmas connected with it4 led Both they and those born higher do not Regress or refine faculties.Both they, nonreturners whose lives are completely transformed in Desire, and those nobles born in the higher realms have familiarity with the path through continuous lifetimes and have attained superior supports that cannot regress. For these reasons, they do not regress, and because that in itself fully ripens their faculties, they also do not refine faculties.(iv) Methods for meditating on alternation of the dhyanas. This has four points.465"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA • VIA. The alternated dharma42a They alternate the fourth dhyan first,W here it says, “If they alternate/The dhyanas, they are bound for Below N o n e.. .”275 what is alternated first? you ask. They alternate both the defiled and undefiled fourth dhyana first, because that is the most workable of all levels and because it is the supreme of the easy paths. The dhyanas arise in order from the first up, and the one that is alternated first is the fourth. Later the third, second, and first are also alternated. The support is that at first one can alternate only as a human in one of the three continents, and then later one can alternate in the Form realm as well.B. The measure of accomplishment in alternating meditation42b Achieved by alternating momentsGreat Expositionists say that right after an undefiled moment a defiled mo­ment is manifested, and then right after that defiled moment another unde­filed m om ent is manifested. In that way alternation is achieved by alternating the defiled and undefiled m om ents, like flowers on a garland. The undefiled and defiled moments are like the path of no obstacles, and the third undefiled mom ent is like the path of liberation, so they say.The Master says that no one except for the Buddha can alternate three single moments, so alternation is performed by entering the three equipoises in suc­cession for as long as they wish.C. The reason to perform alternating meditation42cd In order to take birth and dwell,Also from fear of the afflictions.W hat is the purpose of alternating dhyana? you ask. Nonreturners with sharp faculties alternate in order to not pass into nirvana here but to take birth in the pure abodes and to dwell in bliss in the visible.276 Those with dull faculties also meditate from fear o f the afflictions, in order to keep from regressing from the result by distancing themselves from the samadhi that is concurrent with enjoyment.277 Those nonreturners with dull faculties alternate for all three reasons (birth, abiding, and fear), the sharp for the former two, dull arhats for the latter two, and sharp arhats for only the second reason.466"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUALSD. The cause for the pure realms being definitely five43ab Because there are five types of that,Only five births in pure abodes.W hy are there only five births in pure abodes? you ask. It is because there are five types o f that alternating meditation. In the lesser, there is one defiled be­tween two undefiled moments— three minds are manifest. In the middle, it is doubled for six minds; in the greater it is tripled for nine alternations. In the very great another three are added for twelve alternations, and in the ex­tremely great there are fifteen alternations. As results of these types, there are only five births in the pure abodes from N ot Great to Below None out of the power of their defiled aspects(e) Explanation of those made manifest by body43cd Nonreturners who have gained cessation Are called made manifest by body.N onreturners who have gained the absorption of cessation are explained in the sutras as being called made manifest by body, it is proposed. The reason is because like liberation, the peace of cessation arises on the support of a body with no mind, the Great Exposition explains. The Master states that there is mind at the times when one arises from or enters the absorption of cessation.d. Entering and abiding in arhat. This has three topics: i. Entering, ii.

For that reason, they have attained the ultimate benefit for themselves, so they are capable of performing benefit for others. Because they are worthy of respect from all or­dinary individuals and from attached learners, they are an arhat.(2) Supplementary topics.

Two kinds detach from others.W hen it says, “The path of meditation is twofold,”278 which learner path de­taches one from the desire of which levels? you ask. Only the transworldly path brings detachm ent from the Peak of Existence. The worldly paths can­not, for there is nothing worldly above that and because they are not antidotes for their own levels. Both of the two kinds of paths— the worldly paths of preparation for higher levels and the transworldly path— can detach one from levels other than the Peak of Existence.(ii) How the attainment of removal arises. This has two topics: A. Worldly, and B. Transworldly.468"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUALSA. Worldly46ab Nobles detached through worldly paths Attain removal that is twofold.Well then, what is the distinction between the removal caused by those two paths? you ask. Noble stream-enterers who practice tranquility, for example, and become detached through worldly paths attain removal that is twofold: the attainm ent of both worldly and transworldly removal arises.B. Transworldly. This has two points.1. Presenting others' propositions46cd Some say through the transworldly, too,Since if they forfeit, no afflictions.Some schools say there can be double attainm ent through the transworldly paths, too, since if a nonreturner who has been detached only through the distinctive undefiled path from all levels up to Nothingness refines their fac­ulties, they forfeit the distinctive path of the dull and attain the mere result of the sharp, yet they have none of the higher levels afflictions.2. Refuting them47ab As when ones freed from half the Peak’s O r born above, they’re not possessed.The Master says that although such nonreturners do not have the attainment of worldly removal, they do not have those levels’ afflictions. For example, it is just as when one has no worldly attainment of freedom from half of the Peak of Existence’s afflictions, if one forfeits the transworldly paths by refining faculties, those afflictions would not be possessed. O r for example, when an ordinary individual is born above in a level of the first dhyana or higher, they forfeit the attainment of removal of the afflictions of Desire but do not possess them. Thus the opponents’ position is not convincing. Therefore, those non­returners do not possess the afflictions since there is their nonattainment.(iii) Which levels discard attachment.

Actual47cd Undefiled N ot Unable canRemove attachment to all levels.W hich levels can detach one from the desire for which levels? you ask. The undefiled preparations for the first dhyana N ot Unable can remove attach­m ent to all the higher and lower levels from Desire to the Peak of Existence. The other preparations are definitely defiled, so they can only detach one from the desire of lower levels.2. Dispelling a doubt about its freedom48a—d In victory over the three levels The final path of liberation Comes out of dhyan or preparation.Above, not from the preparations.Do all paths of liberation arise out of the preparations, like the paths of no obstacles? you ask. They do not. Well, how is it? you ask. In victory over the three levels of Desire and the first two dhyanas, if the faculties are sharp, one can switch feelings and as there is little affection for the preparations, the dhyana or essence of the actual practice arises. The final path o f liberation thus comes out o f dhyana or the actual practice. O r if the faculties are dull, one cannot switch feelings, so the final path of liberation arises from the essence of the preparations.279In victory over the higher levels of the third dhyana and above, the prepa­rations and actual practices of the fourth and so forth have compatible feelings. Because of that, and because there is respect for the actual practice, the path of liberation is not born from the last preparations for these higher realms, but from the essence of the actual practice.B. The other eight levels48ef Eight nobles are victoriousOver their own and higher levels.The eight noble or undefiled absorptions— the four actual, special samadhi, and first three Formless— are victorious over their own and higher levels and remove the desire for those levels.

T he worldly paths o f liberation and of no obstacles have peace, et cetera, sublimity and emancipation, as aspects, and coarse, et cetera, like rigidity and thick walls, as their aspects, respectively. And as their sphere, the paths of lib­eration focus on the higher level and the paths of no obstacles on the lower level.B. What arises immediately following the knowing of extinction50.

If they are n o t unshakable, then only knowing extinction or the correct view of the nonlearner arise from the knowing of extinction. As there is no regressing from knowing nonarising, that knowing does not arise in those who are not unshakable. T hat correct view of the nonlearner is something which all arhats have or produce. For even the unshakable, sometimes only the knowing of nonarising arises from the knowing of nonarising, and sometimes the nonlearners’ correct view arises.(b) Explaining the results of the spiritual way.

Classifying in brief5 lab The spiritual way is the stainless paths;Results are com pound and noncompound.W hat are the four results that have been explained? you ask. They are results of the spiritual way. W hat is the so-called spiritual way? you ask. The spiritual way is the eighty-nine stainless paths of no obstacles. Its results are the same num ber of com pound paths of liberation and noncom pound results of removal. In the sutras, these are said to be fourfold.280 Because ordinary indi­viduals have not produced lasting peace, they are not ultimately spiritual.B. Classifying extensively5 led They’re eighty-nine: they are the paths O f liberation, with extinctions.They, the spiritual ways and their results, if classified extensively, are eighty- nine each. How? you ask. There are the eight classes of discards of seeing for Desire and the higher realms. There are the eighty-one discards of meditation, nine for each of the nine levels, for a total of eighty-nine. The paths of no ob­stacles that discard these are the ways. They, the results of the ways, are the eighty-nine composite paths o f liberation, along w ith the eighty-nine cessa­tions that are the extinction of those discards.C.

They are i) relinquishing the previous en­tering path when abiding on the result, 2) acquiring the path of abiding in another result, and 3) com bining extinctions or discards and acquiring an at­tainment of removal, and 4) gaining the complete set of eight knowings— four dharma knowings and four subsequent knowings— and also 5) the complete attainment of gaining all sixteen aspects of impermanence and so forth. In brief, each of the four results has these five causes.D. Rebutting that not all are included53cd Results of worldly paths are mixed,Supported by unstained attainment.Well then, if only the undefiled paths are spiritual ways, how is it logical for the two results attained by worldly paths to be results of the spiritual way? you ask. Because the two results, once-returner and nonreturner, are not attained by the worldly path alone but are also attained by the undefiled path, they are results of the spiritual path. W ith the two types of result for individuals who were previously detached, it is because the previous defiled attainment of removal and the later removal of the undefiled path of seeing are mixed into one and attained together. O r if it is a successive result, the abandonment is supported by the previous unstained attainm ent of removal.(ii) Explaining the spiritual way itself. This has three topics: A.

Explanation of Brahma's wheel of the path54ab It is Brahmas method, Brahmas wheel,Since Brahma is the one who turned it.It, that which is explained as the spiritual way, itself is Brahmas m ethod, be­cause it discards many types of nonvirtuous dharmas of afflictions and mis­deeds. T he Bhagavan is the Brahma of the unexcelled undefiled path, the m ethod of Brahma, so it is Brahmas Wheel, since Brahma, the Bhagavan, is the one who turned it. It says in a sutra:T he Bhagavan is called Brahma. He is also called peaceful and cool.473"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VIB. Explaining the path of seeing in particular as the Wheel of Dharma54cd The Dharma Wheel is the path of seeing,Since it goes fast, has spokes, et cetera.W hat is the essence of the Wheel of Dharma? you ask. The essence of the D harm a W heel is the path o f seeing, since it is comparable to the wheel of a wheel-wielding emperor. Just as the precious wheel spins quickly, vanquishes the unvanquished, brings the vanquished to natural ease, flies up to high levels, and then descends, the fifteen moments of the path of seeing go fast and so on. They cast off the previous truths and enter the later. The paths of no ob­stacles vanquish personality view and the other unvanquished afflictions by severing their attainment. The paths of liberation bring the vanquished to nat­ural ease. It flies up to the truths of the higher realms and, focusing on the truths of the lower, descends.The Venerable Ghosaka says that the noble eightfold path is comparable to spokes, et cetera, so it is called a wheel. Right view, thought, effort, and m ind­fulness are like spokes. Right speech, action, and livelihood are like the hub. Right samadhi is like the rim.Where does the saying that the path of seeing is the Wheel of Dharma come from? you ask. W hen the path of seeing arose in noble Kaundinya, the yakshas above the earth exclaimed, “The Bhagavan has turned the Wheel of Dharma.” This was repeated three times. There is a repetition for the essence of the truth: “These are the noble truths of duhkha, origin, cessation, and path.” There is a repetition for their actions: “I shall respectively know them, discard them, manifest them, and meditate on them.” There is a repetition for their com­pletions: “I have known them, discarded them, manifested them, and medi­tated on them.” For each of the twelve aspects, “Upon appropriate attention, the eye, knowledge, awareness, and m ind arose,” dividing them each into four. If you multiply these, there are twelve repetitions and forty-eight aspects, but they are similar in being sets of three and sets of twelve, so that is what they are called. For example, there are twelve sense bases, but because they are sim­ilar in being sets of two, a sutra combines them in a like way:Bhikshus, I will show you two. Listen to them well, re­tain them in your mind, and explain them. W hat are the two? you ask. The eye and form ... [and so forth up to] and m ind and dharma.The three repetitions teach the paths of seeing, meditation, and no more learn­ing respectively, the Great Exposition says. The Master asks, if that is so, how can the path of seeing alone be the Wheel of Dharma, since it does not fulfill474"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUALSall three repetitions? Therefore, that enum eration of dharmas itself is the Wheel of Dharma, and the three repetitions are also the twelve. It is also turned because their meaning is taught fully and made understood in another’s being.Alternatively, all noble paths are Wheels of Dharma, and the three repe­titions of the twelve aspects as before are from the specifics of repeating the four truths. Turning is producing it in another’s being. W here the sutra says, “W hen the path o f seeing arose in Kaundinya, he had turned the Wheel of D h a rm a...” this means the first turning, it is explained.C. How many results of the spiritual way are attained in which realms. This has two points.1. Actual55 a Three gained in Desire, the last in three.Well, how many results of the spiritual path are attained in which realms? you ask. O f the four results, the three results of stream-enterer, once-returner, and nonreturner are gained in Desire but not in the other realms. The last result is arhat itself, which can be attained in all three realms.2. Dispelling a doubt55b—d Above there is no path of seeing,As there’s no weariness, and scriptures say,“Commence here; come to the end there.”In that case, it is logical that the results of stream-enterer and once-returner, which are attained by those not detached from Desire, are not attained in the higher realms, but why is not the result of nonreturner attained there? you ask. Above the realm of Desire there is no path of seeing. W ithout that, there is no attainment of the result of detached nonreturner. That is the proof.W hy is there no path of seeing there? you ask. In the Formless realm, there is no listening and one does not focus on the lower realms. In the Form realm, one never grows weary because there is attachment to the bliss of absorption and because there is no feeling of suffering, and if there is no world-weariness one cannot attain the noble path. Thus there is no path of seeing there. This is the logical proof.And it is also because The Scripture that Teaches the Ten Groups ofTenz%l says, “The five individuals from those who pass into nirvana in the between state to those bound for higher commence here and come to the end there.”475"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VIIn this, “here” is Desire and “there” is the higher realms. “Commence” means to enter the gate to the path of liberation.iii.

There are, because in the sutras it is said there are six arhats: the regressed one, the one with volition for death, the protected one, unshaken from abid­ing, capable to realize, and the unshakable one.(ii) The explanation. This has five topics: A. Condensing into two, B. The families and results from which one regresses, C. Applying the classification of families to others, D. O n which paths faculties can be refined, and E. The complete classification of regression.A. Condensing into two. This has three points.7. Teaching the five families as occasional liberation56a-c fiveO f whom come from the convinced through faith.Their freedom is occasional.Five of whom , these six arhats except for the unshakable one, arise out of the convinced through faith that precedes them. Their, those five’s, freedom or liberation of m ind is occasional, so it should be known as contingent, because it must always be protected. For just that reason, they are called occasional476"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUALSliberation. They depend upon occasion and are liberation, so they are occa­sional liberation, like saying butter dish. Because they depend upon specifics of provisions, good health, and place to manifest samadhi, they depend upon occasion.2. Teaching the sixth family as nonoccasional liberation56d Unshakable one cannot be shaken,57ab So that is nonoccasional freedomBorn out of the attained through seeing.Because the liberation of the unshakable one cannot be moved through re­gression, it cannot be moved. So for that reason that is called nonoccasional freedom. Because it directly manifests the samadhi of all that is desired, it is not dependent upon occasion and is liberation.Alternatively, of these two results, it is possible for one to regress and im­possible for the other, so the one is liberated until another occasion and the other is liberated forever. For this reason they are occasional and nonoccasional liberation.The unshakable is definitely preceded by attainment through seeing, so it should be known as born out of the cause of the attained through seeing.3. Elaboration on these points57cd Some from the first are in their family,And some become through purification.Are these six arhats in one family only from the very first, or can they change later? you ask. O f the six arhats, some from the very first are in their family of those with volition for death, and some become it through purification of their faculties from regressed one to one with volition for death. Know that it is thus up to the unshakable one, it is taught.Regressed ones without a doubt regress from their result. Those with voli­tion for death think, “If I do not kill myself, I will regress from my result, but if I kill myself, I will not regress.” Protected ones will regress from the result if they do not protect their m ind from desirable things, but if they protect it, they will not regress. Those unshaken from abiding will not regress from visible bliss whether or not they protect their mind, but they do not have the capa­bility to purify their faculties. Those capable to realize will not regress from visible bliss whether or not they protect their m ind and have the capability to purify their faculties from dull to sharp. Unshakable ones will not regress from477"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VIthe result whether or not they protect their m ind and do not need to purify their faculties, because from the beginning they have been in the family of those with sharp faculties.B. The families and results from which one regresses58ab The four regress from family,Five from result. N ot from the first.Well then, can these all regress from their result or family? you ask. The four— one with volition for death and so on— can completely regress from their family, and the five— regressed one and so on— can regress from the result be­cause they have dull faculties. However, there is not any regression from the first family, because there is no lower family than that, and it is made stable by the learner, nonlearner, worldly, and transworldly paths. There is no re­gression from the first result, stream-enterer, because the first result is distin­guished by the abandonment of discards of seeing, and the discards of seeing have no basis. For that reason, there is no complete regression from the result of stream-enterer.Well then, why is it possible to regress from the higher three results but not from stream-enterer? you ask. It is because the discards of seeing have no basis since they are rooted in personality view. They engage the basis of the self, and that self does not exist.The three results delineated by the abandonment of discards of meditation can regress. The afflictions discarded by meditation may have been discarded once, but their object, mere things themselves that are attractive and so forth, do exist, so by that condition it is possible that the afflictions might arise again. For that reason, the discards of meditation do have a basis.From a sutra:Gain and respect make obstacles even for arhats, I declare.From the Sutra like a Heap o f Ashes:283Noble listeners who are well versed, for those who act in this way and dwell in this way, thoughts of nonvir- tuous misdeeds will occasionally arise out of weakened mindfulness.478"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUALSIn another sutra, Venerable Godhika also regressed many times, it is explained. These are the reasons, it is said.The Sutra school says there is no regression from any result attained through an undefiled path, because that conquers afflictions from their root, so it is impossible that the afflictions could arise again. Also, from a sutra:Whatever has been discarded through noble full know­ing, that has been discarded.It is possible to regress from what has been attained through a worldly path, because that cannot conquer the seed of afflictions from its roots.Therefore, the first and last results are definitely only attained by undefiled paths, so regression is impossible, but the middle two both can be attained by either of the paths, so they are possibly both regressable and nonregressable. It is in terms of this that, “I say to the learners, ‘Be careful!’” was said, while that was not said to the nonlearners.Well then, if all arhats thus become only unshakable, why are they explained as six? you ask. They are unshakable from the result only, but they can be di­vided into six in terms of regression some qualities such as samadhi. This is the intent behind saying that gain and respect make obstacles. The latter two scriptures are intended in terms of learners.C. Applying the classification o f families to others58c Six families of learners and nonnobles.Do only the arhats have six families, or do others also have six families? you ask.

On which paths faculties can be refined58d There’s no refining on the path of seeing.O n the paths other than seeing, the faculties can be refined, but there is no refining faculties while on the path of seeing, because training is impossible.

This has three points.479"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY AREA VI7. Actual59ab Regression from attained, from not attained,And from enjoyment: these are called three types.From a sutra:I declare that those who have attained bliss in the visi­ble, the four that arise from the superior training in mind, can regress from any one of them, but I declare that in no way at all can one regress from this one un­shakable liberation of mind made manifest by body.So it is said, but how can an unshakable one who abides in bliss in the visible regress from the attainment of the four dhyanas? you ask. In general, there is regression from what has been attained by losing qualities, regression from what has not been attained by not attaining what is to be attained, and re­gression from enjoyment by not manifesting what has been attained. These are called the three types of regression.2. Which individuals regress in which way59 cd The Teacher has the last; the unshakable,The middle, too; and others have the three.O f those types of regression, the Teacher, the Buddha, has only the last, re­gression from enjoyment: he possesses all qualities but does not make them all manifest. He does not have the other types of regression. T he unshakable one has that and the middle, regression from what is not attained, too, because they have not attained the dharmas of the superior individual. A nd because the other arhats can also regress from what is attained, they have the three re­gressions. For that reason, because unshakable ones can completely regress from enjoyments, this does not contradict the sutra.3. The reason there is no death while regressed from result60ab While they’re regressed, they do not die.They don’t do what should not be done.Is an arhat who has regressed from the result reborn? you ask. There is no such thing, because while they, all those who have regressed, are regressed, they do not die before they have restored the result. From a sutra:480"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUALSBhikshus, noble listeners who are well-versed might have some slight regression in mindfulness, but that will disappear very quickly and be completely extin­guished and completely eliminated.If that were not so, it would not be logical for their minds to be stable with regards to celibacy. They, those who have regressed from a result, do not do anything that should not be done that is exclusive of the result, such as sexual conduct, just as a great hero who has slipped cannot be struck.(b) Methods for refining faculties.

Someone who is capable of realization has nine paths each of no obstacles and liberation to refine to the state of the unshakable one. The rea­son is from strong familiarity with the dull family: they have been accustomed to it for a long time and it has been stabilized by the leaner and nonlearner paths. For example, if someone is accustomed to bad grammar, it is difficult to correct it.B. Learner.61a One each for the attained through seeing.One can train with one path of no obstacles and liberation each to refine one s faculties from convinced through faith into the attained through seeing, be­cause it has not been stabilized by both the learner and nonlearner paths so it is easy to change.

Ordinary indi­viduals refine their faculties through the defiled aspects of peaceful and coarse.(iii) What the support for refining is61b refined by humans.O n what support does one refine faculties? you ask. They are refined by h u ­mans, not on other supports, because nobles born in higher realms cannot regress, as is said:Both they and those born higher do not Regress or refine faculties.284Nobles born as gods of Desire develop renunciation for great and fine objects and then see the truth, so their faculties are naturally sharp and they do not regress, the Prince explains.(iv) On which levels one refines faculties. This has two points.A. Nonlearner61c Nonlearners on support of nine,O n what levels can one refine faculties? you ask.

If they have attained the three levels of Formless, why do they not refine faculties on its support? It is since refinement of faculties forfeits both the mere result of the dull and the path of higher progress even if it has been attained, because the mere result of sharp faculties is always gained. Therefore, since there is no482"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUALSmere nonreturner result on the levels of Formless, these levels do not support refinement.(2) Classifying in nine. This has two points.(i) Actual classification62c Two buddhas, seven listeners:There are nine arhats by distinctions in their faculties. The buddha and self- buddha are instances of unshakable only, because these two buddhas are both included within those liberated through both parts.285 The five of regressed one, etc., and the two unshakable ones— those who became unshakable through purification and those who were unshakable from the first— are the seven listeners.(ii) The reason for this classification62d Nine have nine different faculties.Those nine noble individuals are presented as nine since there are dull, medium, and sharp faculties, each of which is divided into three, so they have nine different faculties. The regressed one, the one with volition for death, and the protected one are the three lesser, medium, and greater dull faculties. The one unshaken from abiding, the capable to realize, and the unshakable one from purification are the lesser, medium, and greater medium faculties. T he unshakable from the first, self-buddha, and buddha are the lesser, medium, and greater sharp faculties.B. Classifying into seven enumerations63a—c The seven individualsAre made by training, faculties,Absorption, liberation, both.Noble individuals can also be classified as seven: followers of faith and dharma, convinced through faith and attained through seeing, made manifest by body, freed through full knowing, and liberated through both aspects. O f these seven individuals, the distinctions in the first two are made by training, because they trained in the meaning by relying on others from the first or by following the meaning of the sutras and so forth. Interest through faith and attained through seeing are distinguished by dull or sharp faculties, because483"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA VIthe faculties are dull with strong conviction through faith and sharp through strong full knowing. Made manifest by body is distinguished through ab­sorption, because those in that state can make the absorption of cessation manifest through their bodies. Liberated through full knowing is distin­guished by liberation from the afflictions, and liberated through both aspects is distinguished both by liberation from the afflictions and by absorption. The former are liberated from the afflictive obscurations through full know­ing and the latter are liberated from those and the obscurations to the ab­sorptions respectively. As they have attained absorption, they are liberated from the obscurations to absorption or liberation.C Combining them into six substances. This has two topics: 1. Actual, and2. Elaboration.1. Actual63d They re six: the three paths each have two.In terms of their names, there are seven individuals, but they are six in sub­stance. It is like this: the three paths of seeing and so forth each have two sub­stances. O n the path of seeing there are followers of faith and followers of dharma. O n the path of meditation, there are convinced through faith and attained through seeing. O n the path of no learning, there are occasional and nonoccasional liberation.To classify them extensively, followers o f faith alone can be classified in terms of faculty, family, path, detachment, and support for a total of 147,825 classifications. Followers of dharma and so forth can all also be calculated in the same way. The detailed method of classification appears under this topic in the Tïka.2. Elaboration. This has two points.a. Identifying the two liberations64ab Those who have gained cessation, liberated By both; the others by full knowing.Well then, what are liberation through both aspects and liberation by full knowing? you ask. Those who have gained the absorption o f cessation through the actual dhyana have been liberated by both, because they are lib­erated from afflictive obscurations by full knowing and from the obscurations484"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"A SPECIFIC EXPLANATION OF PATHSof liberation by samadhi. The obscurations of liberation are the five obscura­tions of forgetting the focus, torpor, agitation, effort, and lack of effort. The obscurations of absorption are the inability to produce the actual first dhyana even when detached from the three realms because the m ind is not workable and so forth.T he others— those other than those who are liberated through both as­pects— are liberated by full knowing from the afflictive obscurations only on the basis of the preparation for the first dhyana N ot Unable. This is liberation through the aspect of full knowing. These two are known as ornamented arhat and unornamented arhat.b. Distinctions in perfection of qualities64cd From their absorption, faculties,And results, learners are called perfect.65a Nonlearners are perfect through two.From a sutra:All those who have discarded five afflictions And have the unlosable dharmas are perfect.W hat is it that makes learners and nonlearners perfect? you ask. From their perfection of absorption (attainment of cessation, the dharma which is similar to liberation) the perfection of faculties (sharp faculties which cannot be lost through conditions) and the perfection of results (nonreturner who has aban­doned the five afflictions that lead to the lowest) learners are called perfect.There are four alternatives of nonlearners who are perfect and those who are not through the two aspects of faculty and absorption. There is none whose result is not perfect.III. A specific explanation of paths. This has three topics: 1. Qualities of the different paths, 2 . Presentation of the factors of enlightenment, and 3.

Distinctions of the four paths of joining and so forth6 5 b -d In brief, there are four types of path:They’re called distinctive, liberation,No obstacles, and path of joining.M any paths have been explained, but to put it concisely, how many paths are there? you ask. In brief, there are four types of all the paths: they are the paths called the distinctive path, the path of liberation, the path of no obstacles, and the path o f joining. In the text they are presented from top down, but to explain them in accord with the way they arise, there are the path of joining, which is the cause of the path of no obstacles; the path of no obstacles, which for the most part is what actually discards obscurations; the path of liberation, which is the first arising of freedom from obscurations; and the distinctive path, which is the continuum of liberation following that. To illustrate with the path of seeing, for example, the precursors to realization, eight forbear­ances, eight knowings, and that which follows subsequent knowing of path are these four respectively.W hy are these called paths? you ask. As one goes from there to nirvana, or one finds nirvana by these, they are called paths.b. Distinctions of difficult, easy, slow, and fast66 . The dhyanas’ paths are easy; those O f other levels, difficult.Dull minds are slow to clearly know;The other ones know clearly quickly.From a sutra:There are paths that are slow to know clearly and diffi­cult. There are paths that are quick to know clearly and difficult. Likewise there are also two that are easy.W hat are these? you ask. T he four dhyanas’ paths are easy because they are fully embraced by the branches of dhyana and arise naturally through equal parts of tranquility and insight, without need for effort. Those paths of the other levels, Not Unable, special dhyana, and the Formless, are difficult because they are not embraced by the branches and must be produced by making efforts at the path as tranquility and insight are not equally balanced. O n the first two486"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"A SPECIFIC EXPLANATION OF PATHSthere is less tranquility, and in Formless there is less insight. Those with dull minds or full knowing, whether on an easy or difficult path, are slow to clearly know and realize, because they direct themselves toward an object and then come to know it slowly.

Forbearance and knowing of cessation and path do not, because they focus on things that are supremely pleasing. All the forbearances and knowings of suffering, origin, cessation, and path that discard remove at­tachment, because they are what discards the afflictions.Thus there are four alternatives between revulsion and detachment. The first, that which is revulsion but not freeing from desire, is the paths that focus on suffering and origin that do not discard.

Because they are inherently right thought, they are view. Saying they are not knowing does not mean that they are not cognition but means that they are not included among the ten knowings.Although the undefiled forbearances are views but not knowing, in contrast the m inds or knowings o f extinction and nonarising have no right thought and do not have the intention to thoroughly investigate, so they are knowings but not views.T he undefiled full knowing of other noble minds than those, the undefiled forbearances and the knowings of extinction and nonarising, are both view and knowing, because they are right consideration and complete recognition, so they have discarded doubt.2.

The knowings are defiled and undefiled.The first is called the relative.Two types of undefiled are onlyThe subsequent and dharma knowings.How many knowings contain them all? you ask. They are contained in ten: i) dharma knowing, 2) subsequent knowing, 3) relative knowing, 4) knowing others minds, 5- 8) knowing of the four truths, and 9- 10 ) knowing extinction and nonarising. Knowing death, rebirth, individuals, samsara, and so forth are all contained within just these.In brief, there are the two knowings, which are defiled knowing and un­defiled knowing. T he first can be perception of either general or self-charac­teristics but is mostly perception of relative things such as vases, blankets, men, women, and so forth, so it is labeled with the name of the majority of its ob­jects and called the relative knowing. To condense the undefiled, there are two types o f undefiled as well: they are only the subsequent and dharm a knowings. Since there is no undefiled knowing not comprised within those two, the word “only” is said.b. An explanation3.

T he sphere o f subsequent knowing is the four truths of suffering, et cetera, of the higher realms.T hrough the distinctions o f the four truths, just these, dharma and sub­sequent knowing, are the four knowings of suffering, origin, cessation, and path because they focus on suffering and so on. These four from suffering to path, when they are dharma and subsequent knowing that is not by nature view, are knowing o f nonarising and knowing extinction. W hen these two first arise, they are the subsequent knowing o f suffering and cause, origin, because without a doubt they focus on the aspects of subsequent knowing of suffering and origin that are on the Peak of Existence.Well, does not vajra-like samadhi have the same focus as those two? you ask. If vajra-like samadhi focuses on suffering or origin, it is the same, but if it focuses on cessation or path, it does not have the same focus. For example, when struck by a poisoned arrow, the deadly poison spreads to all parts of the body, but at the time of death it collects in the area of the wound only and is not in the other parts.Four knowings, dharma, subsequent, path, and relative knowing, can know another’s mind, because that is the nature of those knowings. To speak simi­larly of the other knowings:Dharma and subsequent are known by seven each.The relative by two, and the three truthsBy four each. Knowing path is by five.Extinction, nonarising are each known by six.2. Teaching knowing others' minds in particular. This has two topics: a. Fea­tures of knowing others’ minds, and b. T he distinction between knowing extinction and knowing nonarising.a. Features of knowing others' minds. This has two points.i. General teaching5cd That can’t know higher levels, faculties,O r individuals, destroyed, unborn.Knowing others’ minds should be recognized in this way: That, knowing oth­ers’ minds, knows minds that are equal or inferior to it. A superior m ind is not the object of the inferior. For that reason the m ind of a lower level cannot know the minds of higher levels that surpass it; the m ind of dull faculties,500"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"THE KNOWINGSinterest through faith, cannot know higher faculties that surpass it, or an in­ferior individual can not know the minds of superior individuals that surpass them, because these all surpass what that m ind can know. Because it is a sub­ject that perceives the present mind only, it does not know the destroyed past or unborn future.ii. During the time of the path6 . Dharma and subsequent don’t knowEach other. Listeners know two Moments of seeing. Rhinos, three.The Buddha without training, all.T he knowing of others’ minds that is dharm a m ind or subsequent m ind knows only those minds o f its own class. Those two knowings of m ind do not mutually know each other, because they focus on the separate antidotes of the Desire and the higher realms. It is like looking at the ground or looking at the sky.There is no knowing of others’ minds on the path of seeing, but that path can be its object. If they train, those listeners who can know others’ minds and wish to know the path of seeing can know through knowing others’ minds two m om ents o f seeing: forbearance of dharma knowing o f suffering and dharma knowing. As far as focusing on subsequent knowing, because it is something that is accomplished through the effort of other trainings, subse­quent knowing is not known.Because their faculties are sharper, the rhinolike self-buddhas293 have at that point completed two trainings and can know three moments: the first two moments of dharma forbearance of suffering and dharma knowing plus the eighth m om ent of subsequent knowing of origin. Some say they can know the first two and the fifteenth moment: in either case, they only know three moments and not more. T he buddha, w ithout any training, knows all fifteen moments of the path of seeing.b.The distinction between knowing extinction and knowing nonarising7. Knowing extinction is recognizingThe truths are fully known, et cetera.“There is no more to know,” et cetera,Is nonarising mind, it’s said.W hat is the distinction between knowing extinction and knowing nonarising?501"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VIIyou ask. The Kashmiris say the two are similar during equipoise, but the dis­tinction is in terms of the recognition by post-meditation cognitions. Knowing extinction is knowing that recognizes for each of the truths of suffering and so forth, “I have fully known suffering...,” et cetera: “I have discarded the ori­gin. I have made cessation manifest. I have meditated on the path.” Saying “I have completely known suffering: there is no more to know,” et cetera up to “I have completely meditated on the path; there is no more to meditate on” is the nonarising m ind or knowing, it is said.Unlike the Kashmiris who assert that undefiled equipoise can only have six­teen aspects, the Aparantakas assert twenty-eight undefiled aspects, so they say this difference is known by equipoise as well as post-meditation.C. Examining distinctions among the knowings. This has four topics: 1. Dis­tinctions of the ten knowings, 2 . Distinctions of antidote, 3. Distinctions of aspect, and 4. Explaining other distinctions.1. Distinctions of the ten knowings8 . From nature, antidote, or aspects,O r aspects and the sphere, or training,O r its work being done, or fromDevelopment of cause, there are ten.If there are the three knowings— dharma, subsequent, and relative— why are they presented as ten? you ask. The ten knowings are presented because of seven causes, it is heard. Relative knowing is presented from its nature and essence because it does not know the ultimate. Dharma and subsequent know­ing are presented as the antidote, because they are antidotes for Desire and the higher realms. O r knowing suffering and origin are presented from their aspects, because their focuses are not separate. O r knowing cessation and path are presented from aspects and the focus, because they have separate aspects and sphere. O r knowing others’ minds is presented from training: it is not as if it does not know mental factors of course, but because it arises from training in order to know others’ minds, it is called knowing others’ minds. O r know­ing extinction is presented from its work being done because at first it arises from the cause of its action being completed.294 Knowing nonarising comes from the development o f its cause, because it has all undefiled knowings as its cause. Thus there are determined to be ten knowings.502"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"THE KNOWINGS2. Distinctions of antidote9. The dharma knowings of cessation And path on meditation’s path Are antidotes for the three realms.The subsequent is not Desire’s.Dharma knowing is explained as the Desire realm’s antidote, and subsequent knowing as the higher realms’ antidote. The distinction between them is this: T he dharm a knowings o f cessation and p ath on m editation’s path first achieve victory over Desire. Because it then is possible that very continuum of the path of familiarization will also achieve victory over the higher realms, they can also be antidotes for the three realms.T he subsequent cannot possibly be the Desire realm’s antidote, because subsequent knowing only arises after dharma knowing, so when it arises, dharma knowing has already achieved victory.Thus if it is logical for subsequent knowing not to be explained as the an­tidote for the Desire, why is dharma knowing not taught as the antidote for the higher? you ask. T hat is because it is impossible for all dharma knowing on the path of seeing and dharma knowing of suffering and origin on the path of meditation to act as the antidote for the higher realms.3. Distinctions of aspect. This has two topics: a. The aspects of each knowing, and b. The essence of each aspect.a. The aspects of each knowing. This has five topics: i.

The phrase “and so forth” includes things which are not specific or general characteristics, in­cluding commands such as “Make!” “Drink!” or “Go!” or things such as vases and blankets.iii.

They do not have the aspects of empty or selfless because these knowings designate the self in conventional labels, thinking, “I have extinguished rebirth. I shall know no existence beyond this one.” However, when meditating on the empty and selfless, such conventional designations become illogical through the power of that meditation.b. The essence of each aspect. This has four points: i. Examining whether the undefiled have specific characteristics as aspects, ii. Proving that the sixteen aspects are substantial, iii. The essence of the aspects, and iv. The distinction between perceiver and perceived.i.

The Kashmiris propose that the unstained have no more than the sixteen aspects of impermanence and so on.(2) Other tradition12d But others say there are, from the Treatise.But others, the Aparantakas, say that there are also aspects of specific charac­teristics. The reason comes from the Treatise, Jndnaprasthdna:Does the m ind that does not possess know dharmas? you ask. It knows. In terms of being produced logically, it knows impermanence, suffering, empty, selflessness, cause, origin, fully arising, condition, that this is the place, and that this is the basis.296505"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA VIIii. Proving that the sixteen aspects are substantial13a In substance, there are sixteen aspects.The Aparantakas say that in substance there are the four aspects of suffering and one each for origin, cessation, and path, for a total of seven aspects. The others are synonyms. The Great Exposition proposes that there are sixteen substantially established aspects.The aspects of the truth of suffering are as follows: because it depends upon conditions, impermanent. Because it is inherently harmful, suffering. As it is incompatible with the view of “mine,” empty. As it is incompatible with view­ing “me,” selfless.The aspects of the truth of origin are: In the manner of a seed, cause. In the manner of arising, origin. In the manner of connection, production. Through the meaning of manifestly establishing, condition.The aspects of the truth of cessation are: Because the aggregates have been destroyed, cessation. Because the three fires297 are pacified, peace. Because there is no hostility, sublime. Because it is free of all faults, emancipation.The aspects of the truth of path are: Through the meaning of going, path. Because it has proof, reasoning. Through the meaning of completely accom­plishing, accomplishing Because it makes one transcend utterly and completely, deliverance.iii. The essence of the aspects13b An aspect is full knowing.W hat is a so-called aspect itself? you ask. The Sutra school posits that an aspect is cognitions manner of perception, but Great Exposition proposes that an aspect is full knowing.298iv. The distinction between perceiver and perceived13b-d ThatAnd that with focus can perceive.All that exists is the perceived.Well then, does only full knowing perceive? you ask. No. T h at full knowing and that w ith a focus can perceive. All that exists as knowable phenomena is what is perceived. Thus full knowing is proposed to be all three— full know­ing, perceiver and perceived. All other dharmas with focus are perceiver and perceived, and all that does not have a focus is only perceived.506"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"THE KNOWINGS4. Explaining other distinctions of the knowings. This has five topics: a. Dis­tinctions of essence, b. Distinctions of level, c. Distinctions of support, d. Dis­tinctions of foundations of mindfulness, and e. Distinctions of focus.a. Distinctions of essence14a The first is threefold. Others, virtue.O f the ten knowings, the first, relative knowing, is threefold— virtuous, non- virtuous, and neutral— and the other nine are virtuous only.b. Distinctions of levell4 b -d The first is on all of the levels.The one called dharma is on six.The subsequent on nine. Six likewise.15a Knowing others minds is on four dhyanas.For distinctions of levels, the first of the knowings is on all the levels from Desire to the Peak of Existence. The one called dharm a knowing is on only the six levels of dhyana.2\" As that is the antidote for Desire in particular, it is not on the Formless levels. T he subsequent knowing is on any of the nine undefiled levels.300 The portion of six— knowing the four truths, knowing ex­tinction, and nonarising— that is included within subsequent knowing is like­wise also on nine. The portion included within dharma knowing is on six levels. Knowing others’ minds is difficult to produce, so only the easy paths of the actual practices of the four dhyanas support it.c. Distinctions of support15b—d That has Desire and Form as support,And dharma has support of Desire.The others, on three realms’ support.W hat supports are they on? you ask. T h at knowing others’ minds is supported only by the dhyanas, so it definitely has Desire and Form as its bodily support. And dharma knowing, as it is primarily weariness with Desire, has the support o f Desire only. The higher two realms are detached from Desire, so they are no longer weary of it. T he eight knowings other than those two have any of the three realms as support.50 7"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY AREA VIId. Distinctions of foundations of mindfulnessI 6 ac Cessation m ind is one foundationO f mindfulness, and knowing minds Is three. Those which remain are four.Well then, which of the foundations of mindfulness do these knowings have as their essence? you ask. The essence of cessation m ind focuses only on non­composites, so it is only the one foundation of mindfulness of dharmas. And because minds that know others’ minds only perceive concurrences,301 they are the three foundations other than mindfulness of body. Those eight know­ings which remain are any of the four foundations of mindfulness.e. Distinctions of focus. This has three points.i. How many knowings does each knowing have as its focus.I 6d Nine are the sphere of dharma mind.17a-c Nine of the path and subsequent mind;And two of suffering and cause.Ten are of four, and none of one.How many knowings are the focus of each knowing? you ask. Nine knowings are the sphere o f dharm a m ind, because relative knowing is the object of dharma knowing of suffering and origin, and the eight undefiled except for subsequent knowing are the object of dharma knowing of path. Nine know­ings other than relative knowing are the sphere o f the knowing of path, be­cause that only takes an undefiled object. And the object of subsequent knowing is the nine other than dharma knowing, as above. And two, relative knowing and defiled knowing of others’ minds, are the object o f both knowing suffering and knowing its cause, origin. All ten knowings in order are the ob­ject of four knowings— relative, others’ minds, extinction, and nonarising. This is because the object of relative knowing is all dharmas, the object of knowing others’ minds is all concurrences, and knowing extinction and nonar­ising are partially dharma knowing and partially subsequent knowing. And none of the knowings at all are the object of the one knowing cessation, be­cause that does not know composites and focuses on noncomposites.ii. Which subjects focus on many dharmas17d There are ten dharmas to apply.508"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"THE KNOWINGS18ab The three realms, and the stainless, and The noncom pound are twofold each.There are ten dharmas into which knowables can be divided. To know how many are the object of each of the knowings, apply them. The way the dhar­mas are divided into ten is that the defiled three realms and the stainless dhar­mas are each divided into concurrent and not concurrent, and the noncom pound has virtue and neutral, so they are twofold each or divided in two.iii. How much one knowing knows18cd Just relative knows what is outside Its own collection to be selfless.Can one knowing know all dharmas? you ask. It cannot. However, just the relative knowing knows all dharmas that are outside its own collection to be selfless. Here, its “own collection” is its essence and the dharmas that are si­multaneous with it. Because their object is separate from their subject, because they are separate from their focus, and because they are extremely close, these do not see each other, just as the eye cannot perceive the eyebrows.II. Explanation of possession19. O n the first of undefiled moments,Those who are attached possess one knowing.O n second, three. After on eachO f four moments they have another.W hich individuals possess how many knowings? you ask. An ordinary indi­vidual who is attached possesses relative knowing alone, and if detached they also possess defiled knowing of mind.O f nobles who are on the first of the undefiled moments, those who are attached possess the one relative knowing. O n the second m om ent dharma knowing and duhkha knowing are added, so they have three. After that on each o f four moments, the fourth, sixth, tenth, and fourteenth, they have an­other knowing— subsequent knowing, knowing of origin, knowing of cessa­tion, and knowing of path respectively.

A nonlearner possesses the first nine if of dull faculties, and all ten if sharp.III. How the knowings are attained. This has four topics: 1. Attained during the path of seeing, 2 . Attained on other paths, 3. How many are attained from each path, and 4. Classifications of their attainment.1. Attained during the path of seeing2 0 . As they arise on the path of seeing,Future forbearances and knowings Like them are gained. O n that uponThree subsequent, the relative, too.2 1 . Thus they are called clear realization’s end.They are nonarising dharmas. O n its own And lower levels. Cessations is the last.Their own truths’ aspects. Born of effort.At what points are how many knowings attained? you ask. As they, the eight forbearance and seven knowings, arise on the path o f seeing, when they arise the future similar forbearances and knowings like them are gained in their own time. Thus when dharma forbearance of duhkha arises, the attainment of a future dharma forbearance with similar focus and aspects arises and so forth. For the attached, the level is only N ot Unable, and for those detached, any of the six levels. One attains the forbearance of two times for the level of one’s bodily support. One attains only the future forbearance of other levels, but it does not become manifest because multiple paths of seeing do not arise.O n that path of seeing itself upon three subsequent knowings of suffering, origin, and cessation, the relative knowing is attained, too. It is not attained on dharma knowing, because the truth has not been clearly realized to its full extent. W hy not on subsequent knowing of path? you ask. The truth of the path itself is not clearly realized by the previous worldly path, and the truth has not been clearly realized to its full extent. T hus they— the relative know­ings that arise out of the subsequent knowings of suffering, origin, and cessa­tion— are called “arisen from clear realizations end” because they arise after the clear realization of each truth. Well, do not these relative knowings that are arisen from the end of clear realization sometimes become manifest? you ask. Because they are nonarising dharmas, they do not become manifest.The relative knowings of how many levels are attained? you ask. Relative knowings are attained on the level that is its, the path of seeing’s, own and on510"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"HOW THE KNOWINGS ARE ATTAINEDlower levels. If the path of seeing is on N ot Unable, relative knowings of that level and the lower level of Desire are attained.The relative knowing arisen from the end of clear realization of cessation is the last of the four foundations of mindfulness, mindfulness of dharmas. The other two are all are foundations of mindfulness. These relative knowings arisen from the end of clear realization have their own tru th s aspects, attained on the level of the clear realization of that truth. Because they are attained by the path of seeing, they are born of effort, not through detachment.2. Attained on other paths. This has two topics: a.

If it is a worldly path of meditation that views the aspects of peaceful and coarse, the present relative knowing arises. However if the path is transworldly, since subsequent knowing is not the antidote for Desire but dharma knowing is, dharma knowing and knowing of one of the four truths arises in the present. The remaining knowings are attained in the future, be­cause they develop the cause of same status of their own class.

There are four types of at­tainment: acquiring attainment, maintaining attainment, attainment of anti­dote, and distancing attainment. The one called acquiring attainment is newly acquiring com pound virtue, and m aintaining attainment is the attainm ent of manifesting already attained composite virtue over and over again. Present dharmas can have both acquiring and maintaining attainments, but future dharmas can only have acquiring attainment, and past dharmas have neither.As far as the attainm ent o f the antidote and the attainment of distancing, the first is the attainment o f the antidote for defiled dharmas, and the second, distancing, is having abandoned them. Respectively these are making one­self detached from body and mind, and cutting the attainment of the afflic­tions. Therefore, undefiled attainm ent can be the first two, defiled virtuous attainment can be all four, and the remaining defiled attainments can be the last two.The Aparantakas posit that there are six attainments by adding the attain­ment of vows, which bind the gates of the faculties, and the attainment of dis­integration, which destroys clinging to a whole by analyzing the body into its parts. The Kashmiris, however, say that these two are contained within the last two of the previous four attainments.IV. Qualities of the knowings. This has two topics: A. Unshared qualities, and B.

The dhyanas,29. Et cetera, faculties, and interests,Capacities, are nine. Path might Be ten. The two are relative.Extinction is six or else ten.T he possible and the not possible is fact and nonfact, such as that it is impos­sible to become a buddha as a woman but possible as a man and so forth.305 In brief, it is composites and noncomposites. Knowing the possible and im­possible is in general the ten knowings: if one divides dharmas into ten,306 all ten are objects of relative knowing. Dharm a knowing knows five; subsequent knowing seven; knowing suffering and origin, six; knowing cessation knows noncomposite virtue alone; path knowing knows the two undefiled; knowing others’ minds knows three; and knowing extinction and nonarising knows nine dharmas, excluding neutral noncomposites.The power of knowing karma and the full ripening of its result is the power of knowing the defiled contained within suffering and origin. In that, there are the eight knowings with the exception of knowing cessation and path.There are also the powers of knowing the dhyanas, et cetera, including the eight emancipations, three samadhis, two absorptions, and the nine absorp­tions of final repose; knowing through the differences in lesser, medium, or greater faculties of faith and so forth whether someone is principal or not prin­cipal, which is the power of knowing whether the faculties are supreme or517"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VIInot; and the power of knowing the various interests of individuals who have interest in listeners, self-buddhas, or buddhas; and the power of knowing var­ious capacities. Master Sanghabhadra says that capacities are the intentions completely created by previously habituated imprints. Here it is proposed as knowing the many different distinctions in m ind and mental factors. These four powers focus only on composites, so they are the nine knowings excluding knowing cessation.The power of knowing the paths that lead everywhere from hell to cessation, if held to be knowing the path and its result, m ight be ten knowings. The word “might” indicates that if you hold it to be knowing only the path, it is the nine that exclude cessation.Knowing many of one’s own and others’ previous births and their particu­lars is the power of remembering previous places. The power of knowing death and rebirth is seeing death, transmigration, and the good and bad colors and so forth of the between state through the utterly pure divine eye and knowing that the causes of virtuous and nonvirtuous karma make beings wander to the high or low realms. These two, as they must definitely perceive the aspects of specific characteristics, are relative knowing.The power of knowing the extinction of defilements, if you hold the ex­tinction of defilements to be cessation only, is the six knowings of dharma knowing, subsequent knowing, knowing cessation, knowing extinction and nonarising, and relative knowing. O r else if you hold it to be cognition in the being of one who has extinguished defilements, it is all ten knowings.(2) Distinctions of level30a—c The powers of previous places andO f death and birth are on the dhyanas.The others, on all levels.T he two powers o f remembering previous places and o f knowing death and rebirth are on the four actual dhyanas, because these are something that is generated by samadhi that is the union of tranquility and insight, whereas the other powers are not. The other eight powers are on all levels— Desire, the six levels of dhyana, and the four Formless— because they are easy to generate. The undefiled ones are supported by any of the undefiled levels, and those powers contained within relative knowing are supported by all levels, it is pro­posed. The bodily support is a male on Rose-Apple Land only.(3) Explanation of the term518"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"QUALITIES OF THE KNOWINGS30cd Why?Because his powers cannot be hindered.W hy are only the Buddhas ten knowings called powers? The listeners and self- buddhas also have them, so why are theirs not called powers? you ask. Because theirs are hindered, they are not called powers. Therefore, only his, the Bud­dhas, are presented as powers. The reason they are said to be powers is because they engage all knowable phenomena and cannot be hindered. The others’ knowings are not like that, but the Buddhas are.ii. Powers of the body31. His body has Narayana power.Some say his joints. It is the power O f elephants times ten seven times.This is the sensory base of touch.Well then, if his powers of m ind are infinite, how much power does his body have? His, the Buddhas, body has Narayana power. Narayana is the name of a power, like for example calling a number with sixty digits uncountable. There­fore, Narayana is the power, and one who has that is called Narayana. Alter­natively, the power of people of the first aeon is also called Narayana power.Some say that he has the Narayana power in each of his bones’ joints. Some venerable Darstantika elders say that the power of his body is infinite, like the power of his mind, because if that were not the case, the body would not be able to bear the infinite power of his mind. If it could not bear that, the Bud­dha would not have inner nature of forbearance. The Master also gives the same explanation. The joints of buddhas, self-buddhas, and wheel-wielding emperors are respectively as strong as the most exalted knot of nagas, a chain, and driven nails.As for the measure of what it, Narayana power is, the power o f ten ordinary elephants is one elephant chief. Likewise there are the seven powers of great quantity, completely overcoming, supreme limbs, supreme power, and Narayana power.307 The power of the previous times ten is the power of the next in succession, so it is multiplied seven times. Some say that ten supreme powers are half of Narayana power.The essence of this sort of power is the sensory base o f touch. This is a fea­ture of only the great sources; it is not source-derived. Some say that power is an eighth touch that is different from the seven that were explained before.308b. Explanation of the four fearlessnesses. This has two points.5i9"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY # AREA VIIi. Overview32a There are four types of fearlessness.There are four types of fearlessness: the Tathagata proclaimed aloud, “I myself have completely, perfectly awakened. I have extinguished the defilements.” W hen teaching the listeners, he proclaimed “These obstruct liberation. These are the paths that definitely deliver one from samsara.” As he sees no true rea­son that anyone could say, “It is not like that,” and defeat him in accord with the Dharma, he has attained fearlessness.ii. Explanation32bc They’re similar to the first, tenth,Second, and seventh of the powers.W hat are their natures? you ask. T hey are similar to the powers. The fearless­ness to proclaim the benefit for himself of perfect realization is like the first power of knowing the possible and impossible. The fearlessness to proclaim the benefit for himself of perfect abandonm ent is just like the tenth power of knowing the extinction of defilements. The fearlessness of teaching the dhar- mas that obstruct for benefit of others is just like the second power of knowing karma and its fully ripened result. And the fearlessness of teaching the dharmas of emancipation for the benefit of others is just like the seventh of the powers, knowing the paths that lead everywhere.c. Explanation of the three foundations of mindfulness32d The three are mindfulness, awareness.There are three foundations of mindfulness taught in the sutras. W hen the Tathagata teaches the Dharma, if the beings gathered are respectful and wish to listen, he is neither pleased nor attached; if they are not respectful and do not wish to listen, he is neither displeased nor angry; and if some are respectful and some not, he does not become in part pleased and in part displeased, but abides in equanimity with mindfulness and awareness. The essence of these is mindfulness and awareness, but they are taught as three because of distinc­tions in the gathering.Well then, the listeners and self-buddhas also have this quality, so it is not appropriate to be unshared, you say. T hat is not the case, because the listeners and self-buddhas have not abandoned the imprints, but the buddhas have. In this context, imprints are features that out of the power of prior training in520"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"QUALITIES OF THE KNOWINGSafflictions have the ability to move the body and speech. These are in the mind, the authors of the tïkas explain.309 Some others say they are features of a neutral mind.d. Explanation of great compassion33. The great compassion, relative mind,Is greater from its gathering,Its aspect, sphere, and being equal.There are eight ways that it is different.T he great compassion is inherently relative knowing or m ind. If it were not, not only would it be proven not to focus on all sentient beings, it would be proven not to have as aspects the three sufferings, as compassion does.W hy is it called great compassion? you ask. It is greater because it is per­fectly created by the great gathering accumulation of merit and wisdom, be­cause its aspect is consideration of the three sufferings, because its focus and sphere are the focus on all sentient beings of the three realms, and because it is equal in the way it engages beings, remembering that all sentient beings of the three realms have the suffering of formation, and because it is full knowing by nature, so it is extremely sharp, and there is nothing greater than that.How many things make compassion and great compassion different? you ask. There are eight ways they are different in essence and so forth. The eight are:In essence, nonhatred, nondelusion.In focus, one realm or three realms.In aspect, one suffering or three.In level, four dhyanas, the fourth.In beings, the listeners, the Victor,Attainment, detached or Peak.In meaning, don’t fully protect, fully.In deed, partial, or impartial.3103.

How the buddhas are equal in some features34a—c All buddhas are the equal inAccumulation, dharma body,And acts for wanderers’ benefit,Are all buddhas equal in all aspects? you ask. All buddhas are the equal in three ways: the excellent cause, having completed gathering the two accumu­lations; the excellent result, acquiring the transformation of the undefiled ac­cumulations, the dharm a body; and the excellent benefit, acting for wanderers’ benefit to place them in the higher realms and the liberation of enlightenment. Otherwise some buddhas would be better or worse, which is impossible.b. How they are unequal34d But not in life span, caste, or size.But however, they are not equal or comparable in their life span, caste, or body size, because they display those variously in accord with those who need taming.Three qualities’ classifications:Four each, gathered in sets of four.Four causes: all of two accumulations,Familiarized for a long timeW ith no interruptions, respectfully.Four results are of wisdom and also Abandonment, power, Form Body.Four wisdoms: knowing everything,All aspects, untaught, without effort.Four abandonments: all the afflictions,Forever, all imprints as well,And all obscurations of absorption.Four powers are mastery to emanate And bless and transform outside objects;And mastery to bless or discard life;And mastery to go where obscured,522"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"QUALITIES OF THE KNOWINGSTo the sky or far off, or make smaller;And constant display of amazements.Four of Form Body: marks major, and signs;The powers, relics hard as a vajra.Four benefits: deeds of emancipating From three lower realms and samsara;Three vehicles and bringing to high realms.As proofs and rebuttals are prominent,These last are in two sets of four.These are just in brief: no one other than the Buddha could possibly recite them in full, because the tathagatas possess infinite marvelous qualities. Those without merit could not hear of his qualities, and even if they heard of some, fools measure things against themselves and feel neither sincerity nor belief. Whoever has great sincerity and belief in the Buddha and his features, such a being is wise.B. Shared qualities. This has two topics: 1. Overview, and 2 . Explanation.1. Overview.

Explaining the features of each of the six qualities. This has three topics:(1) The unprovocative samadhi, (2) Knowledge from aspiration, and (3) The four unhindered knowledges.(1) The unprovocative samadhi36. The unprovocative is relativeKnowing on dhyanas end. Unshakable.Human. Unborn afflictions of Desire,Including their basis, are its sphere.Some arhats produce a cognition such as, “The suffering of sentient beings arises from the afflictions, so when they know me to be a superior field of qualities, may they not produce any of the afflictions sentient beings have, such as desire and so forth, when they observe me.” Because that path does not provoke afflictions in anyone, it is called unprovocative samadhi.T he unprovocative is by nature relative knowing. It is on the support of the fourth dhyanas end, because that is the supreme of the easy paths. It is produced by arhats who are unshakable, but not by others, because occasion­ally afflictions arise in others’ beings as well, so they cannot abandon the afflic­tions. It is produced by hum ans of the three continents. The unborn future afflictions o f Desire including their basis are its sphere or focus, because it has the aspect of thinking, “May future afflictions not arise in others.” It can­not discard afflictions that do not have a basis.311524"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"QUALITIES OF THE KNOWINGS(2) Knowledge from aspiration37 ab The knowledge from aspiring is Similar, focusing on all.T he knowledge from aspiring is similar to the unprovocative: it is relative knowing in essence, on the level of the last dhyana, among the unshakable ones, and on hum an support of three continents. However, knowledge from aspiration focuses not just on the afflictions and their bases, but on all, form and all other dharmas.Knowledge from aspiration is knowledge that comes after having made a previous aspiration. After aspiring, “I will know this and that,” one enters the equipoise o f the highest end fourth dhyana and knows it as the object just as it is. Therefore, since higher levels are not the object, it does not know the Formless realms directly, says the Great Exposition. Others propose that the Buddha knows even the Formless directly through knowledge from aspiration.(3) The four unhindered knowledges.

The first three unhindered knowings are, in order, knowing names, meaning, and speech w ithout obstruction. The word dharma applies to many different meanings, but in terms of the unhindered knowledge of dharmas, it refers to unobstructedly knowing the collection of names, words, and letters. Unhindered knowledge of meaning is proposed as unobstructedly knowing either all dharmas that can be known or the supreme meaning, nirvana. Un­hindered knowledge of speech or the expression of words is unobstructedly knowing gender, tense, usage, and other aspects of syntax.(ii) The four dharmas of the fourth38cd The fourth is logical and fluentClear speech; and mastery of path.39 ab Its focus is on speech and path.It is nine knowings, on all levels.T he fourth, unhindered knowledge of eloquence, is the logic of the contra­dictions and connections between meanings, and fluent, clear speech itself, and through attention on oneself, having unobstructed knowledge of mastery of path by not forgetting the samadhi of tranquility and insight. The first of these is skill in articulate speech, and the second is skill in attention on oneself. These are eloquence and also unhindered knowledge, so they are the unhin­dered knowledge of eloquence.Its, unhindered knowledge of eloquence’s, focus is on speech and the defiled and undefiled paths. Its nature is the nine knowings excluding knowing ces­sation.

Although unhindered knowledge of expression is attained through the power of the fourth dhyana, it is not on the level of the fourth dhyana, just as the emanated m ind of Desire is attained by the actual dhyana but is not the actual dhyana.(3) Identifying the highest end of the fourth41 a-c it is dhyanas end,Gained by progressing through all levels,Com ing to highest development.It is dhyanas especial upper end, because it is gained by progressing through all levels from Desire to the Peak of Existence, entering the absorption of each level in forward and reverse order,313 so that it is compatible with the highest end of all levels.

W hat are the fourteen? you ask. The results o f levels of dhyana, respectively. From the first dhyana, there are two minds of emanation on the levels of Desire and the first dhyana. The re­sults of the second dhyana are three— those of the two lower levels and its own level. The results of the third dhyana are four— those of the three lower levels and its own level. This continues to the fourth dhyana that has five, the four lower levels and its own in succession.Here there is something that must be known: emanating an object in Desire is the action of the emanating m ind of Desire, but that emanating m ind itself is contained within the levels of dhyana. Therefore, emanating minds that are results of dhyana are of their own and lower levels, but those emanating minds born from the higher levels are not the lower levels’ result, because if one has not attained the higher level, one cannot produce its emanating mind. If one has attained the higher level, the emanating m ind is the result of that level itself.534"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"QUALITIES OF THE KNOWINGSC.

What mind supports emanations speaking31b But speech by lower levels, too.But in particular, when emanations of the second dhyana and higher engage in speech, they speak only by the speaking m ind of the lower level first dhyana, because above that there is no consideration or examination on their own level, and speech depends upon the motivation o f consideration and analysis.

Dispelling a doubt5 Id After it’s blessed, another starts it.Well then, when there is a m ind that speaks, there is no mind of emanation, so for that reason the emanation would disappear and who would speak? you ask.

There are blessings for bones and other stable body parts, but not for the unstable flesh, blood, and so forth, because Noble Mahakasyapa did not bless his flesh and so forth.

W ith humans,There are not any gained on birth.Hell beings both know others’ minds and remember previous places at first from the time they are born until they are agonized by the feelings of suffering. Once they are agonized, they no longer know because they are oppressed by suffering. Those who live among other wanderers know permanently.

It is called that because the mind rests one-pointedly on the focus of equipoise. The Great Exposition says that the dharma that is the mental factor of samadhi that makes the cognition rest in equipoise is samadhi, and that itself is one-pointedness. The Sutra school says that cognitions with the same focus only are samadhi, and other dharmas such as the mental factors are not. The Great Exposition and Sutra schools both make many propositions.

Explanations of terms. This has two topics: (1) Explaining the term Formless realm, and (2) Explaining the names of each of the four.(1) Explaining the term Formless realm. This has two points.(a) Actual3c In Formless realms, there is no form.The Majority school and others say that the Formless is not entirely without form, but as the form there is subtle, it is said to be Formless. Such a proposal is illogical. If its form is subtle by aspect, tiny aquatic creatures would also be present there, and if it is subtle by nature, the Form realm would also be Form­less. If it is by extreme subtlety and clarity, you should only propose that the Peak of Existence is that.Well then, merely the forms of vows of body and speech are there, you say. They are not, because there are neither body nor speech, nor any sources there. It is also not acceptable to say that they are not on their own level but are born from other levels, similar to undefiled vows, because the forms of vows of body and speech are bound by the bonds of existence and thus cannot exert power over another level.From the Sutra o f the Great Welcomed7Those dharmas that are life and that are warmth are mixed; they are not unm ixed...Also:Name and form are mutually supporting.And in teaching interdependence:By the condition of consciousness, nam e-and-form ...These quotations are said with the lower two realms in mind. If you propose that they apply to all situations, it would follow that external warmth would also be mixed with life and all external forms would depend upon name and arise from consciousness itself. Because of this, these quotations are not proof that there is form in Formless.From a sutra:547"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY ?f AREA VIIIThe Formless are emancipation from form. Whatever is one o f the four peaceful Formless emancipations transcends form ...Also:There are sentient beings who do not have form.Also:Having transcended the conception of form in all aspects...These quotations contradict the proposition, so the name Formless is not ar­bitrary. Therefore, in the Formless realm there is no form, not even the slight­est bit, which is why it is called Formless.(b) Dispelling a doubt3d Then form arises from cognition.Well then, when one is born from the Formless in a lower realm, for more than a few aeons the continuum of form has been broken, so how does form arise again? you ask. T hen at that time form arises from acquiring entry into the cognition that is stained with the cause of its full ripening. The grasping cause is the four sources in Desire and Form.The Sutra school says that there is a seed of form in the m ind’s continuum, from which form arises. The Yogic Conduct school says form arises from its seeds, which are in the all-ground.(2) Explaining the names of each of the four.

No. Well then, what are they like? you ask. They are called by those names because during the training for them, one views the lower levels as having faults and thinks, “Conscious­ness is infinite. Space is infinite. There is nothing at all.” From training so548"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"THE DHYANAS AND THE FORMLESSwith such attention, they are called by the names Infinite Consciousness and so forth because o f the training. However, any of them can focus on other dharmas.(b) Explaining the names of the last4cd Since it is feeble, no conception,But it s not nonconception, either.Since it, the motion of conception, is feeble, there is no clear conception, but it is not total nonconception, either. Alternatively, during the training one views both coarse conception and nonconception as faulty and generates the absorption through the attention that thinks, “This which is neither concep­tion nor nonconception is peace.” This is the highest level of samsara, so it is also called the Peak of Existence.3.

There is no undefiled Peak of Existence.b. The meaning of each classification6 . The one concurrent with enjoyment Has craving. Virtue of the worldly Is pure, which is what that enjoys.The undefiled transcends the world.T he one called concurrent w ith enjoyment has concurrence with craving. Itis also concurrent with other afflictions, of course, but the reason that only craving is taught here is because craving is realized to be the greatest hindrance to emancipating oneself onto higher levels. The virtue of the worldly absorp­tions is called pure because it is concurrent with nongreed and other positive dharmas.W hat does the concurrent with enjoyment enjoy? you ask. Pure absorption passes, immediately after which is what, the experience, that concurrent with enjoyment enjoys. It is regression from that which it experiences.T he undefiled absorption transcends the w orld and takes the truths as aspects.2. Identifying the branches of dhyana. This has three topics: a. Correlating the branches to each absorption, b. Teaching three branches in particular, andc. Teaching the distinctions among the absorptions.a. Correlating the branches to each absorption.

Five on the third: there’s equanimity,And mindfulness, awareness, pleasure, rest.The last has four: mindful, equanimous,N ot pain nor pleasure, and samadhi.T he first dhyana has five branches: through abandoning such impediments as desire of the Desire realm, malice, hostility, and so on, there are the two antidotal branches of considering and examining. Having discarded the im­pediments through considering and examining, there is joy and pleasure born of withdrawal, which are the branches of benefit. These former are accom­plished through the power o f one pointedness, so there is the supporting branch of samadhi. Samadhi is both a branch and also dhyana. The others are only branches, it is heard. T he Master explains that, “T he dhyana of five branches is just like an army with four branches.”There are four branches on the second dhyana: the antidotal branch that abandons the impediments of consideration and examining, true inner seren­ity; and the branches of benefit and support, joy, and so forth, pleasure and one-pointedness itself.There are five branches on the third dhyana: the three antidotal branches that discard the impediment of the lower levels’ joy: the formation equanimity, which by not striving for joy has the characteristic of spontaneity in relation to the focus; and mindfulness, which does not forget the continuum of sequanimity; and awareness, which does not forget mindfulness. The branches of benefit and support are respectively pleasure and the samadhi of a m ind that rests.T he last, fourth dhyana, has four branches: completely pure mindfulness, the formation equanim ity that is free of the eight faults of lower levels, and neutral feeling that is not pain nor pleasure, and completely pure samadhi.In terms of names, the branches of dhyana are eighteen, because the first and third have five branches each, and the second and fourth each have four.ii.

For that rea­son, there are four alternatives of branches that are on the first dhyana but not on the second, etc.b. Teaching three branches in particular. This has three points.i. Explaining distinctions in pleasure9ab PleasureO n the first two is pliancy.W hy is the pleasure of the third dhyana said to be a different substance than the pleasure of the first two dhyanas? you ask. W hat is called the branch of pleasure on the first two dhyanas is pliancy; it is not a feeling. Because the pleasure of the third is the feeling of pleasure, it is logical to say that it is a dif­ferent substance than the pleasure of the first two levels.The pleasure of those two levels is not the feeling of pleasure because the dhyanas of absorption block the sense consciousnesses, so it is not bodily pleas­ure. Joy is taught as a branch, and that is mental pleasure, which cannot arise simultaneously with cognitive pleasure, the Great Exposition proposes.The Darstantikas do not assert pleasure born of cognition and so present only bodily pleasure as a branch. The branch is not pliancy called by the name o f pleasure. Otherwise it would follow that the pliancy of the fourth dhyana would be pleasure. If one needs a pliancy that is compatible with the feeling pleasure, it follows that the pliancy of the third would also be that. It also says in a sutra:At the time that noble listeners have manifested through their bodies the pleasure born from complete with­drawal and perfected it, dwelling within it, at that time the five dharmas of this are discarded. The meditation of the five dharmas, great serenity, joy, pliancy, pleasure, and samadhi, is completely perfected.Here pliancy and pleasure are said to be separate, and that would be contra­dicted, they say.552"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"THE DHYANAS AND THE FORMLESSii. Explaining complete serenity in particular9c Serenity is faith,True inner serenity is confident faith that having attained the second dhyana, one is emancipated from the first dhyana.iii. Explaining the distinctions of mental pleasure9cd and twoScriptures say joy is mental pleasure.Some other schools say that joy is a different mental factor and mental pleasure is taught as the branch of pleasure of all three dhyanas. This is not correct, be­cause if it were, it would contradict the two scriptures. In the Viparitasutray328 after saying, “The third dhyana,” the Bhagavan said:O n this, the arising of all faculties of mental pleasure without exception cease...Also:O n the fourth dhyana, all faculties of pleasure without exception cease.From the Sutra which Teaches the Branches o f D hyana:^And pleasure is also discarded. Previously suffering has also been discarded, and mental pleasure and mental suffering have also previously disappeared...Because it would not be proven that mental pleasure had previously been dis­carded, on the third dhyana there can be no faculty of mental pleasure. There­fore, the joy of the first two dhyanas is only m ental pleasure and is not pleasure.c. Teaching the distinctions among the absorptions. This has three topics:i. Distinctions between the afflicted and unafflicted, ii. Features of the fourth dhyana, and iii.

They are not. W hich of them are not? you ask. In the afflicted first dhyana, there is no joy or pleasure born of withdrawal, because it is not with­drawn from the afflictions of that level. O n the second dhyana, there is no great serenity, because it is sullied by the afflictions of its own level. O n the third dhyana, there is no awareness or mindfulness because it has been made completely deluded by afflicted pleasure. O n the fourth, there is no equanim ­ity or pure mindfulness, because those two have been stained by the afflictions.

They, the eight faults, are considering, examining, the in-breath and out-breath, and pleasure and the other three, suffering, mental pleasure, and mental unhappiness.¡ii.

O n the second dhyana, there are both neutral and mental happiness; and on the third there is also pleasure and neutral. And on the fourth there is only the neutral feeling.O f these, the pleasure of the first dhyana is solely bodily feeling supported by eye, ear, and body, and its neutral feeling is both bodily and mental. From the second dhyana and above, they are all only mental feelings. Bodily feeling is always accompanied by considering and examining, and because there is no considering and examining on the second and above, there can be no bodily feelings, either.(2) Dispelling a doubt13.

How the afflicted is attainedI4d Afflicted, by regressing, birth.Afflicted absorption, when not previously possessed, is attained by regressing such as when one regresses from detachment from the first dhyana and attains the afflicted first dhyana. Except for the Peak, it is also attained by birth from a higher realm into a lower realm. For example, when one is born from the second or higher dhyana into the first dhyana, one can attain the afflicted first dhyana. The afflicted Peak is only attained through regression.

Actual practice.i. Training. This has two points.(1) Distant training18cd Going through eight levels up and down,Both types in sequence,How does one produce skipping absorption? you ask. One goes through the eight levels, going up in ascending order and down in descending order. One enters each of the four dhyanas and four Formless, both defiled and undefiled types in sequence. In order, one enters the absorption o f the defiled first samadhi. Then one enters the absorptions going up in ascending order as far as the Peak of Existence, and then coming back down in descending order to the first dhyana. Then one enters the absorption of the undefiled first samadhi. Then one enters the absorptions going up in ascending order as far as unde­filed Nothingness, and then coming back down in descending order to the undefiled first dhyana. This is the initial training for skipping absorption.(2) Near training18d or skipping one,Then one enters the defiled absorption of the first dhyana, skips one level, and enters the absorption of the third dhyana. Then by skipping every other level one goes up as far as the Peak in ascending order, and then skipping every other level one comes back down as far as the defiled first dhyana in descend­ing order. Then one enters the undefiled absorption of the first dhyana and skipping one level enters the undefiled absorption of the third. Then skipping every other level, one enters the undefiled absorption of Nothingness and then559"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY AREA VIIIcomes down to the undefiled first dhyana skipping every other level. This is the advanced training for skipping absorption.ii. Actual practice19ab Then going to the third of theDifferent type is skipping absorption.Following that, one then enters the defiled absorption of the first samadhi and then skips one and goes to the third dhyana of the different, undefiled type. Discarding the fourth, one enters defiled Infinite Space, and discarding an­other, enter undefiled Nothingness. Then one discards every other level down to the first dhyana. In this way, skipping every other level and alternating be­tween the incompatible defiled and undefiled dhyanas and Formless is the ac­tual practice of skipping absorption.The explanation here that one cannot skip more than one level is in terms of listeners with dull faculties. The explanation in the Ornament o f Clear Re- alizationm that it is possible to skip eight is in terms of bodhisattvas with sharp faculties.Only nonoccasional, totally liberated arhats on the support of the three continents can produce this, because they have no afflictions and have mastery over samadhi.4. What support manifests them. This has two points,a. General19cd The dhyans and Formless, on their own O r lower support. No use for lower.T he dhyanas and the Peak and the other Formless absorptions are manifested on the support of their own level or lower levels down to Desire. W hen one is born in a higher level, the absorption of the lower level is not manifested, because there is absolutely no use for the substance of the lower absorption. Producing the samadhi of the lower has the function of producing the full ripening of the lower, but the higher level has transcended the full ripening of the lower, because the samadhi of the lower level is inferior.560"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"THE DHYANAS AND THE FORMLESSb.

What sphere they focus on. This has three points.a. What afflicted dhyana focuses on20c Enjoyment focuses on own existence.Absorptions with craving that are concurrent with enjoyment focus on their own level’s existence, defiled things. They do not focus on the lower because they are detached from it. They do not focus on the higher, because they are completely separated from the higher by craving. They do not focus on the undefiled, either, because then it would follow that they were virtuous.b.

This has two points.i. What the undefiled actual practice discards21 c The undefiled discard afflictions,O f the dhyanas and Formless that are pure, undefiled, and concurrent with enjoyment, the undefiled discard the afflictions of their own and higher levels. Theres no need to mention the concurrent with enjoyment— even the pure does not discard. Because the preparations have detached one, the pure does not discard the afflictions of lower levels. Because it is not their antidote, it does not discard afflictions of its own level. Because they are greatly superior, it does not discard the higher level’s afflictions.ii. What the preparations discard2 Id As do pure preparations, too.As do the undefiled, the pure preparations for higher levels of dhyana and form discard the afflictions of the level below them, too. The word “too” means that N ot Unable is included within the undefiled. It has already been explained that it can discard the afflictions of every level.334Therefore, the defiled actual practices do not discard any afflictions at all because the lower level’s have already been discarded and they cannot discard the afflictions of their own or higher levels.b.

As far as the m anner of entering absorption, each o f the preparations has seven aspects through which one can enter the absorption: attention on thorough knowledge of the characteristics, attention produced by interest, attention on complete withdrawal, attention on taking delight, attention on562"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"THE DHYANAS AND THE FORMLESSexamination, attention on the end of training, and attention on the result of the end of training.

They’re pure,O n the first two dhyanas, there is the feeling joy. O n the third, pleasure, and on the fourth, neutral. Do their preparations have similar feelings? you ask. They do not. They, the preparations, are pure in essence. They are not con­current with enjoyment because they are not free of revulsion for the lower level and because they are a path that brings detachment.(b) Which feelings they are concurrent with22 b not pleasure and not pain.They, the feelings on the preparations, are n ot pleasure and are not pain or suffering, so they are only neutral. This is because the preparations must be induced by exertion, so they arise out of effort. The pervasion holds because the paths that arise without effort are concurrent with joy and pleasure.(c) Particulars of the essence22 c The first is also noble.T he first of the preparations, N ot Unable, is not solely pure; it can also be noble or undefiled.(d) Others' assertions22 c Some say, threefold.Some say N ot Unable can be all three, including concurrent with enjoyment.

The special dhyan is an actual practice in which there is no considering, but in which there is examining. Thus the first dhyana has the classifications as the mere actual practice that has both considering and examining, and the special that has examining only.

Below it, on the first dhyana and N ot Unable, there is samadhi that has considering and examining. Above it, from the preparations for the second to the Peak, there is samadhi that has neither considering nor examining.2. Classifying in terms of path. This has three points.a. Identifying the essences of the three samadhis24. The signless has aspects of peace,And emptiness engages selfless And emptiness. No wishing has All other aspects of the truths.The sutras speak of the three samadhis: the samadhi of emptiness, samadhi of no wishing, and samadhi of signlessness. O f these, the signless samadhi is a samadhi that is free of the ten attributes— the five objects, the four character­istics of composites, and male and female attributes— and from focusing on noncomposites has aspects o f peace, the four aspects of the truth of cessation. And the samadhi of emptiness is samadhi that, for any focus, engages only the two aspects o f selfless and emptiness. The samadhi of no wishing is a samadhi that focuses on composites and only has the aspects of the truths that create revulsion, so it is concurrent with all the other aspects o f the truths than those six previously mentioned. It is a samadhi that is concurrent with the ten remaining aspects: four of the truth of origin, four of path, and suf­fering’s aspects of impermanence and suffering. Because the other six do not create revulsion, it does not have them.b. Classifications of their internal categories25a They’re pure or stainless.They, these three samadhis, can be pure worldly or stainless, transworldly un­defiled.

As for the signlessness of signless­ness, if one arises from the nonlearner’s signlessness while viewing the aspect of peace, the conditions for the continuation of signlessness are not met, so signlessness of signlessness focuses on the nonanalytic extinction or the at­tainm ent of nonanalytic cessation.

The other5 ¿7"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY AREA VIIIdhyanas are also known to be the same. There is no certainty of dwelling in happiness in future lifetimes, because it is possible to regress, and those who are reborn in higher realms or pass into complete nirvana do not have the first dhyanas happiness. The clairvoyance o f divine eye that knows death and re­birth, and the knowing concurrent with the m ind consciousness that arises after that, are proposed as that samadhi which knows and sees. The defiled or undefiled qualities of the three realms that are produced by training and everything undefiled are the meditation on samadhi of discernm ent or full knowing. T he vajra-like samadhi that has the support of the last fourth dhyana is samadhi meditation that extinguishes all the defilements.Thus these four samadhis are taught just as the Bhagavan himself mani­fested them in the past. At the very first, he produced the first dhyana in the shade of a Rose-Apple tree. Later he sat beneath the Bodhi Tree, and just after taming the Maras he saw with the divine eye the miserable deaths and births of sentient beings. In order to give them refuge, he produced the dhyanas, emancipations, and so forth during the night session. At dawn, on the basis of the fourth samadhi, he manifested the paths up to the vajra-like samadhi, the Great Exposition says.III. Explanation of the qualities supported by samadhi.

Distinctions of object30d Their sphere is beings of Desire.W hat do they focus on when they meditate on these aspects? you ask.

That is because there is no eye consciousness above the second dhyana.(2) Explanation of the third32c The third, on the last, is nongreed.T he third, the emancipation of the lovely, is on the last of the dhyanas, the fourth. As its essence is the antidote for greed, it is primarily nongreed, but since it has the lovely as its aspect, it is not repulsiveness meditation. Thus one emanates an attractive form and views it as lovely. As that itself is manifested by the body of samadhi, it is so called. Including their associations, the first three are the five aggregates by nature.The need for the emancipation of the lovely is that by meditating on the repulsive, ones mind is depressed, so one uplifts it with intense joy. Also, if attachm ent to a lovely emanation arises, the first two emancipations have not been completed, but if it does not arise, they have, so this is in order to examine that.The emancipation of the lovely is not taught in the first three dhyanas be­cause there is joy on those levels, so if one pays attention to the lovely and has joy and craving for that object, nongreed will not be accomplished. Alterna­tively, it is not taught there because they are dhyanas that have faults, so non­greed is not accomplished there.(3) Explanation of the Formless emancipations32d Virtuous Formless equipoise.Only the four virtuous— pure or undefiled— Formless equipoises are eman­cipations; the afflicted and the states of beings not in equipoise such as the state o f death are not.

It is because the first two are directed away from greed; the third, away from being discouraged and at­tached; the four Formless, from the conception of form; and cessation is di­rected away from conceptions and feelings, or alternatively all formations.(b) The mind of entry33 b That follows the subtlest of the subtle.Regarding entering the absorption of cessation, the conception of the Peak of Existence is the subtlest in the three realms, but focusing on cessation is by far the subtlest of all, so one enters that absorption of cessation immediately following that subtlest of the subde minds.(c) The mind of arising33 cd One rises from that through own level’s Pure or the noble of the lower.W hen arising, one rises from that cessation, as one has resolved to do, through one’s own level— the Peak’s— pure, or through the noble undefiled mind of the lower sense base of Nothingness. In this way, the absorption of cessation and the m ind that enters it are on the level of the Peak, so they are defiled only. The mind of arising can be either defiled or undefiled.iii. The spheres of the first seven. This has two points.(1) The sphere of the first three34a Sights of Desire are the first’s object.The sights of the sense base of form o f Desire are the object of the first two of the eight emancipations, and the third has an attractive object. Well then,573"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY # AREA VIIIare these not emanations on the basis of samadhi? you ask. O f course they are, but they are emanations contained in Desire.(2) The sphere of the Formless3 4 b -d The Formless’ sphere is suffering And such of own and higher levels,Compatible with subsequent knowing.T he sphere of the four emancipations of Formless is the suffering and such, including origin and all paths, o f their own and higher levels that is com pat­ible w ith subsequent knowing. It is possible that the Formless emancipations can be the samadhi of no attributes of no attributes, so they can also be non- analytic cessation. Noncomposite space is also the object of the sense base of Infinite Consciousness.W hy is there no emancipation presented on the third dhyana? you ask. Be­cause it has no desire for the colors of the level of second dhyana and because it is produced by absorption of pleasure, it is not presented. Well then, if on the third dhyana also there is no desire for color, why is the emancipation of the lovely produced on the fourth dhyana? you ask. As one is discouraged by repulsiveness, it is to make oneself intensely joyous or else to analyze whether or not the repulsive emancipations have been accomplished. If when paying attention to the lovely, afflictions do not arise, those two have been accomplished.b. The overpowering sense bases. This has two topics: i. Classifications, andii. Explanation of their characteristics.i. Classifications35a Eight overpowering sense bases.According to the sutras, while conceiving of internal form, viewing small ex­ternal forms with good and bad colors and viewing large external forms with good and bad colors are the first two overpowering sense bases. While con­ceiving that there is no internal form, viewing the same two are the third and fourth. While conceiving only that there is no internal form, viewing external forms that are blue, yellow, red, and white are the last four. W hen these eight all have overpowered those forms, the sort of conception that arises is the first through the eighth overpowering sense bases.Conceiving of internal form and that there is no internal form is the con­574"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"THE QUALITIES SUPPORTED BY SAMADHIception of the form of the viewer himself being destroyed or not. Small and large are forms of sentient beings and the world. Good and bad colors are at­tractive and unattractive. Overpowering them is gaining mastery. Knowing and seeing are explained as paths of no obstacles and liberation, or tranquility and insight according to Master Arya.339 In the sutra, for the four colors there are four phrases using the words blue and so forth that are repeated twice each, once for the example and once for the meaning. The first m ention is an overview, the second the natural, the third the fabricated, and the fourth the dharmas common to both. The flax, karnikara flowers,340 bandhujivaka flow­ers, and the planet Venus are examples of the natural, and the cloth is an ex­ample of the fabricated.341ii. Explanation of their characteristics. This has three points.(1) Explanation of the two overpowering sense bases of that with form viewing form35b Two like the first emancipation;O f those, the first two overpowering sense bases are like the first emancipation in the particulars of their nature, level, and aspects.(2) Explanation of the two overpowering sense bases of that without form viewing form35c Two like the second.Two of the overpowering sense bases, the third and fourth, are views like the second emancipation.(3) Explanation of the four overpowering sense bases of color35cd Others are likeEmancipation of the lovely.The others, the four emancipations of color, like emancipation o f lovely are on the level of fourth dhyana, focus on attractive forms of the Form realm, are nongreed by nature, and are the five aggregates, it should be understood.c. The all-encompassing sense bases. This has two topics: i. Classifications, and ii. Their individual natures.575"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VIIIi. Classifications36a Ten all-encompassing sense bases.T he sutras teach of the ten all-encompassing sense bases, which have the meaning of making the visualized aspect pervade the focus uninterruptedly. To classify them, there are the ten of earth, water, fire, air, blue, yellow, red, white, space, and consciousness.ii. Their individual natures. This has two points.(1) Explaining the first eight36bc Eight are nongreed on the last dhyana.Their sphere is Desire.O f these, the first eight are in essence the virtue of nongreed. They are on the level of the last fourth dhyana. Their sphere is the sense base form of Desire, similar to how the four sources are known as color and shape in the world.342 According to some, since it says, “The atmosphere/Is the element itself... ”343 the object of the all-encompassing sense base of wind is touch.(2) Explaining the last two36cd Two are pure Formless;Their sphere is their four aggregates.It is explained in the Levels344 that the other sense bases are not set forth as all-encompassing, since sound is discontinuous; and since the five faculties do not pervade the world, and scent and taste do not pervade the Form realm.The last two all-encompassing sense bases are in nature the pure virtue of the first two Formless equipoises. T heir sphere is their own level’s four ag­gregates only, unlike the Formless emancipations described above, because here it is in terms of focus on particulars, the learned ones have said.The last two Formless are not set forth as all-encompassing sense bases since they are unclear and thus incompatible with expanding and contracting, or according to some, since they are the result of the all-encompassing. It is ex­plained in the Great Compendium;345... because the all-encompassing of Infinite Space and Consciousness is infinitely and immeasurably accom­plished, so there is no enhancement of that.576"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"THE QUALITIES SUPPORTED BY SAMADHIT he distinctions among the emancipations, overpowering sense bases, and all-encompassing sense bases is that their qualities gradually increase. First the emancipations are directed away from the discards. Then the discards are overpowered. Then it is made pervasive, so as the earlier are perfected and purified, the latter arise, and they are each superior to the previous. For that reason, they are lesser, medium, and greater, or cause, both cause and result, and result only.2. How they are attained37 ab Cessation has been explained. The restAre gained through detachment or by training.O f these twenty-six, the support and attainm ent of the emancipation of ces­sation have already been explained in the second area.346 T he rest, the re­maining twenty-five, are gained merely through detachm ent if familiar— that is, if they have ever arisen before— or if unfamiliar, by training and effort, be­cause they arise from the power of habituation or nonhabituation.3. Distinctions of support. This has two points.i. Actual37cd The Formless are supported byThree realms. The rest arise in humans.The four emancipations called Formless and two of the all-encompassing are supported by three realms. The rest, the other nineteen, arise in hum ans, so they are only on the support of humans. This is because they must be pro­duced by the power of scripture, and the gods and other wanderers do not have the scriptures.ii. Elaboration38ab In two realms, the power of cause and karma Produces Formless equipoise.Well then, since there are no scriptures there, how do the absorptions of dhyana and the Formless of higher levels arise in the higher two realms? you ask. The absorptions of dhyana and the Formless are produced by the power of four things: scripture, cause, karma, and dharma nature. In the higher two realms, there is no scripture, but the power of both cause and karma produces577"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VIIIFormless equipoise. Production by power of cause is when previously on a hum an support one has meditated on the samadhi of the Peak of Existence and regressed from that. After being born either on one of the lower Formless levels or in the Form realm, through the cause of same status of previous med­itation, the samadhi of the Peak arises. Production by force o f karma is also when in a previous hum an life one performs karma that will definitely ripen as birth in the Peak in a future life. After regressing, one is born in one of the previously m entioned lower levels, and since one must definitely be reborn on the Peak, at that point the absorption of the Peak will be attained. This also has a causal aspect, but since karma is primary it is explained to be called produced by the power of karma.4. How samadhi arises38cd Those two and also dharma natureProduce the dhyanas in Form realm.Those two powers of cause and karma, and also the power of the dharm a na­ture produce the dhyanas in the Form realm.Second, an explanation of the branch that completes the composition, the actual summary of the treatise. This has three topics: A. How long the teach­ings will remain, B. The summary of the treatise itself, and C. The manner of completing the explanation.A. How long the teachings will remain. This has two points.1. The teachings39 ab The Teacher’s True Dharma is twofold:In essence, scripture and realization.How long will this true abhidharma that explains the aspects of dharmas— defiled, undefiled, level, focus, aspects, and so forth— remain? you ask. The Teacher s True D harm a is twofold: in essence, it is the Three Baskets of scrip­ture and realization, the factors of enlightenment.2. How long they will remain39 cd These are upheld only by thoseW ho teach them and accomplish them.578"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"THE SUMMARY OF THE TREATISEW hat is it to uphold the Dharma of scripture? you ask. According to the scrip­tures, these, the scriptures, are upheld only by those who, after coming to know them, teach them to others with an unafflicted intention. This is also called upholding the baskets, upholding the scriptural Dharma, and upholding the teachings. And those who uphold realization accomplish them , the dhar- mas of the factors of enlightenment, within their being and practice them. As there are no upholders of the teachings or True Dharma other than these two, the word only is said.The upholders of the scriptures are the supports for those who speak and accomplish. The unerring supports for the scriptures are those with accom­plishment. Only those who have accomplishment are the upholders of real­ization because without accomplishing it, one cannot teach the meaning one has realized.Therefore the True Dharm a will remain as long as there are beings who speak and accomplish the Dharma. In particular, as far as the teachings of the Teacher Shakyamuni, the autocommentary explains, “They will remain for a thousand years.” Some say that this is in terms of realization, but that the scriptures will remain a thousand years longer than that. This latter is also the explanation of the authors of the tikas. The Prince explains:“The scriptures will remain for a long time” means that they will remain another thousand years. I view this position only as logical.From The Good Aeon?*1The True Dharm a of the Thus-Gone Shakyamuni will remain for a thousand years. For another five hundred years, a pseudo True Dharma.The M inor Topics also say Dharma will remain for a thousand years. The Sutra Requested by Candragarbha348 explains that it will remain for two thousand years and be destroyed by the strife of Kaushambir. Master Kamalaslla says in his commentary on the Vajra Cutter Sutra, “It is renowned among the learned that the teachings will last five times five hundred years.”In the Commentary on the Hundred Thousand,349 it is said that by dividing five thousand into sections, there are ten periods of five hundred years. In the first, many arhats will appear; in the second, many nonreturners, and in the third, many stream-enterers, so these are the three chapters of the period of results. In the fourth period, there will be many who abide by the trainings of full knowing. In the fifth, by the trainings of mind, and in the sixth, by the579"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY * AREA VIIItrainings of discipline, so these are the three chapters of the period of accom­plishment. In the seventh, there will be many who uphold the abhidharma; in the eighth, who uphold the basket of sutras, and in the ninth, who uphold the vinaya, so these are the three chapters of the period of scripture. The tenth is called the chapter of those who hold merely the signs, and it is also labeled the last five hundred. After that the True Dharma will disappear. At that time, the lifespan of humans in the Rose-Apple Land will be fifty years. Now the lifespan is sixty years and it is the period of the abhidharma, it says.According to the calculations in the Glorious Rangjung Dorje s A Clarifi­cation o f the Four Times o f the Omniscient Lord?50 the duration the teachings will remain is set at strictly five thousand years. Calculating from this Fire Rat year (1576), in the completed year of the Female Wood Pig (1575), 952 years had passed since the completion of the three five-hundred-year periods of re­sults. Another 2548 years are thought to remain.B. The actual summary of the treatise itself. This has three topics: 1. How the treatise was composed, 2 . Confessing mistakes, and 3. Advice to be care­ful.1. How the treatise was composed40ab I mostly have explained this abhidharma According to the Kashmiri Exposition.Is the abhidharma explained in this treatise the abhidharma that the Teacher explained? you ask. I, Vasubandhu, have explained this Dharma of the Treasury o f Abhidharma partially according to the tradition of the Sutra school and the Aparantaka Great Exposition. However, I mostly have explained this abhid­harm a according to the school of the Kashmiri Great Exposition, because I explained it in Kashmir strictly according to the Exposition.2.

There’s no refuge O r counsel for beings, and the stains that slay qualities Run rampant in this at their pleasure.43a-c And so, as we know that for the Sage’s teachings,It’s as if the last breaths now rasp in the throat,That this is a time when the stains have great strength:As he taught his disciples the distinction between what is the path that leads to liberation and what is not, the Teacher, the Bhagavan, is like the eye o f the world. T hat eye has been closed— he has passed into nirvana— and it is as if worldly folk have been left sightless. The beings other than the Buddha who were witness to the dharma, the noble beings such as Kasyapa, have mostly passed into nirvana and perished. Blinded by ignorance, those ordinary indi­viduals who have not seen the thatness of Dharma and who are bad logicians and headstrong, following pseudo reasoning without relying on the Teacher’s scriptures, have confounded the teachings of the Teacher through exaggeration and denigration.T he one Bhagavan, who is self-born, having found wisdom in his last ex­istence without anyone to explain the scriptures, and those who cherish his,581"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"YOUTHFUL PLAY # AREA VIIIthe self-borns, teachings have passed without any remainder of the aggregates into the supreme peace that is superior to samsara. W ithout the Buddha or his children, there is no refuge or counsel who can give correct instruction for beings, and the stains of bad views and so forth that are the cause that slays the previously explained qualities and makes the teachings disappear run ram pant in this world at their pleasure, or indiscriminately.And so, as we who are intelligent know that for the Sage s teachings, the teachings of the Buddha, it is as if, for example, the last breaths at the ap­proach of the time of death now rasp in the throat and will not remain long, and as we know that this is a time when the stains of bad views have great strength, follow the forthcoming advice.b.

That is the root of all virtuous dhar- mas. In the words of the Bhagavan:Carefulness is a place of deathlessness;Carelessness is a place of death.Those who are careful will not die;The careless always die.352The meaning of these is explained in Letter to a Friend:™A place of nectar, carefulness; but a place O f death is carelessness, the Sage declared.Thus to develop virtuous qualities,You always should act with respect and care.Also from Individual Liberation:354Venerable ones, aging and death will truly come, and the teachings of the Teacher will be destroyed, so the venerable should practice the yogas of carefulness.

The autocommentary also has a ninth area, “Teachings on the Individual,” which refutes the existence of an individual self. Tibetan sources generally explain that Va- subandhu wrote the ninth chapter later than the root verses, at the time that he was writing the autocommentary. The fact that this area comes after Vasubandhus con­cluding advice— “All those who want freedom, be careful!”— tends to support this position. The verses for this area do not appear in the Derge Tengyur root verses, and Youthful Play, like most Tibetan commentaries, does not comment on this area.2. Mi bskyod rdo rje, 2003, vol. 1, 98.3. Skt. matrika, Tib. ma mo. Another term for abhidharma because it classifies phe­nomena into groups or matrices of two or three.4. The Fifth Shamar Konchok Yenlag.5. Skt. pratyekabuddha, Tib. rang sang rgyas. Although commonly translated as solitary realizer, that translation is awkward and not entirely accurate, as not all self-buddhas attain realization in solitude. In the Tibetan, the syllable rang indicates that they attain enlightenment on their own, w ithout a teacher in their last lifetime. Hence they are self-awakened or a self-buddha.6. For example, such as the Prince Siddharta before he attained enlightenment.7. The internal sense bases are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, and the ex­ternal sense bases are form, sound, scent, taste, touch, and dharmas.8. Some non-Buddhists believe that the gods such as Brahma or Sakra can liberate be­ings through their miraculous powers or by bestowing holiness or blessings upon them.601"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"NOTES ON AREA I9. The eighteen original schools of Buddhism.10. Skt. anusaya, Tib. phra rgyas. The six are the subtle afflictions o f desire, anger, pride, ignorance, view, and doubt. The kernels are discussed at length in area V.Many translations from the Tibetan translate this term as “subtle-expander” or a similar term, matching the literal meaning of the Tibetan com pound and reflecting Vasubandhus explanation of the meaning of the Sanskrit term in V.39. However, this sounds clumsy and awkward in English. Translations from the Sanskrit often either leave the Sanskrit anusaya untranslated or translate it as “predilection.” The word predilection has some merits but is frequently used in a positive sense in English. As the kernels are always afflicted, that seems inappropriate. The word kernel matches the meaning of phra rgyas in that a kernel is something small that can develop into something larger.Additionally, different schools of Buddhism have differing opinions as to the nature of the kernels. Theravadins and the Kashmiri Vaibhashikas posit that they are latencies, like seeds, whereas the Great Vehicle abhidharma presents them as manifest, though subtle. The English word kernel can mean seed, but it also is used in other contexts to describe a manifest but subtle quality, as in the phrase “a kernel o f truth.” Thus kernel can be used to describe both the Theravada and the Great Vehicle positions without prejudice.11. Tib. med dgag A no-negation generally negates the existence of something. In other words, the Sutra school proposes that liberation is merely the absence of obscurations, but is not in itself a thing. The same term is sometimes translated as nonaffirming negation, but here a simpler translation is preferred, although one must note that just as not every Tibetan negation that uses the word med is a med dgag, not every negation that uses no is a no-negation.12. T hat is, Vasubandhus autocommentary.13. See III.96 d.14. An actual antidote is unable to coexist with what it discards, so therefore other wisdoms, which unlike the wisdom o f the ten powers can coexist with the causes of unknowing, are not their actual antidote.15. The Kashmiri Great Exposition asserts that the attainment or possession of some­thing is itself a substantial thing separate from that which is possessed. See 11.36 ff.16. Variously translated in other translations as wisdom, discernment, supreme knowl­edge, or left untranslated but anglicized as prajna, this term refers to both an ordinary mental factor present with every cognition as well as, especially in Great Vehicle scrip­tures and treatises, the sixth transcendence, transcendent full knowing. Although at first glance, these might seem to be entirely different, the Buddha characterizes both in the sutras as fully distinguishing dharma from nondharma. In other words, it is fully knowing what is true and what is not, or intelligence.602"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"NOTES ON AREA IT he English word wisdom seems a good translation for the term ye shes (jndna), so it seems best not to use it for shes rah to avoid confusion between the two. Discernment seems quite appropriate for the mental factor that accompanies ordinary cognitions but somehow “transcendent discernment” does not sound particularly inspiring. Supreme knowledge is a very literal translation of the Tibetan explanations of the ety­mology of the word, but it is rather opaque. No one could argue that prajna has the wrong meaning, but English speakers do not naturally understand it and might think of it as being something exalted and foreign— not something that is associated with everything that happens in our minds. For these reasons,fu ll knowing seems the best translation.17. Prince Yas'omitras Sphutdrthabhidharmakosavyakhya, an explication of the auto­commentary.18.

Wu shes, samjha. This is commonly translated as perception, but that has several meanings in English and this aggregate refers to only one of them. The aggregate of feeling, part of the aggregate of formations, and the aggregate of consciousness are also perception, and so calling this aggregate perception is potentially confusing and misleading. W hat this aggregate refers to is the mental process of forming an idea about the object: it is like when one sees a vase and thinks “T hat is big” or “T hat is small.” Additionally, in other contexts the word du shes matches the usage of the Eng­lish words conception or idea.33.

Entering fire refers to the non-Buddhist practice of sitting in the middle of five fires: fires in each of the four directions and the sun above. Entering water refers to ritual bathing in the Ganges and so forth.236. Universal means a kernel that can focus on any of the classes of discards. Nonuni- versals can only focus on their own class. For example, a universal kernel of seeing suffering can focus on the discards o f seeing any of the truths or meditation, but a nonuniversal kernel of suffering can only focus on the truth of suffering.237. Discards of seeing are sometimes called “mistaken engagements,” and they are classified in two types: direct mistaken engagements and mistaken engagements of mis­taken engagements. Direct mistaken engagements focus on one of the four truths in an erroneous manner. For example, doubt that is discarded by seeing cessation actually focuses on the truth of cessation but sees it mistakenly, doubting its truth. Mistaken engagements of mistaken engagements focus not on the actual truth, but on one of the direct mistaken engagements. For example, desire discarded by seeing the path does not focus on the path, but might take the form of attachment to the view of holding austerity and discipline supreme, etc. (Mi bskyod rdo rje 2003, vol. 1, 357-8)238. Shariputra has past kernels from when he was an ordinary individual, but because he has become an arhat, they do not develop.239. For example, craving that is concurrent with enjoyment. Cf. V III.5.240. Specific afflictions are afflictions that arise because of a specific object. For ex­ample, when focusing on a pleasant object, desire arises. W hen focusing on an un­pleasant object, anger arises. W hen one focuses on a pleasant object and gets conceited, pride arises.241. Yasomitra explains that just as flax is directed toward the production of its flowers and seeds, future phenomena must be directed toward an object of any of the three times. (Tengyur, ngu pa, 113A).242. General afflictions can arise with regard to any object.616"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"NOTES ON AREA V243. In this and following points, tim e refers to composite dharmas of the past, pre­sent, and future. See 1.7c. In other words, the Great Exposition school posits that past and future objects have substantial existence in the same way that present objects do.244. This is one point where Wangchuk Dorje’s position differs from the autocom­mentary. The autocomm entary says these stains have been abandoned but not re­moved, answering the question posed in 28ab.245. I.e., the discards of seeing suffering, of seeing origin, and of meditation.246. See V.47ff247. There are four graspings presented in the sutras: grasping at Desire, grasping at views, grasping at overesteeming discipline and austerity, and grasping at belief in a self (Mchims 2009, p. 471). Since unlike the floods, ignorance is combined into the other graspings, some people might wonder how there could be four graspings, and W angchuk Dorje is addressing such a concern with this statement.248. This is an explanation of the Sanskrit anusaya (kernel) as a com pound of words meaning “subtle” and “expand.” The Tibetan term phra rgyas literally means “subtle expander.”249. The words for defilem ent in Sanskrit and Tibetan, dsrava and za g pa, literally mean the pus and nastiness that oozes out of wounds.250. P u t and ooze are the explanations of defilement, carry aw ay is the explanation of flood, attach is the explanation o f yoke, and grasp is the explanation of grasping.251.

W hen a vase is destroyed by a hammer, someone who looks at its remains will think of them as shards, not as a vase. W hen one examines water with full knowing, one sees that it is merely a collection of particles of the eight substances and no longer conceives o f it as water. Thus vases and water are said to exist only in relative or con­ventional terms.264. W hen examining form, for example, whether one tries to destroy it or exclude it with mind, the perception o f form is not discarded.265. The sixteen aspects of the four truths are described in VII. 13.266. In other words, if the attainments were part of the four precursors to clear real­ization, then noble beings, who have the manifest attainments of the four precursors, would still have the four precursors in a manifest way. However, the precursors are no longer manifest in nobles, who have progressed on to higher levels.267. Someone who first attains supreme dharma as a woman and then subsequently changes sex and attains a male body (either in the same life or the next), reattains supreme dharma on that male support as well.268.

Someone of dull faculties is unable to do so and must go through the preparations.

In this passage, “clearly knowing” is a translation of the Sanskrit abhijna and T i­betan mngon shes, which in many instances refer to clairvoyance. However, from the descriptions in various commentaries, it appears in this context to refer to merely knowing something clearly, not clairvoyance.287. The fo u r foundations o f mindfulness are mindfulness of body, feeling, mind, and dharmas, discussed above in VI. I4ff. The fo u r complete abandonments (also called right endeavors) are abandoning nonvirtuous dharmas that have arisen, preventing those that have not arisen from arising, producing virtuous dharmas that have not yet arisen, and developing virtuous dharmas that have arisen. The fo u r fe e t o f miracles are devel­oping faith, being diligent, taking control of the mind, and fully engaging oneself to manifest wisdom. The fiv e faculties are faith, diligence, mindfulness, samadhi, and full knowing, described above in II.l. The fiv e powers are the same as the faculties, but more highly developed. The seven branches o f enlightenment are mindfulness, full dis­cernment of dharmas, diligence, joy, pliancy, samadhi, and equanimity. The noble eighrfoldpath is right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right samadhi.288. Cf. VL15ab.289. That is, the foundations of mindfulness arise on the path of accumulation. The complete abandonments arise on warmth, the feet of miracles on the peak, the faculties on forbearance, the powers on supreme dharma, the branches of enlightenment on the path of meditation, and the noble eightfold path on the path of seeing.290.

It appears that rhinolike is used here as a general term, inclusive of the congregat­ing self-buddhas as well as the rhinolike self-buddha: the autocommentary states that self-buddhas in general have three knowings.294. This line appears slightly differently in the autocommentary and Chim Jamyang s commentary: “because it first arises in the continuum of a being whose action has619"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"NOTES ON AREA VIIbeen completed.” This might be the result of a typographical error: the Tibetan only differs by two letters. However, the meaning in both instances is similar.295. See VII. 13.296.

The three fires of greed, hatred, and delusion.298. In other words, the Sutra school posits that when we perceive something, we do not directly perceive it. Instead, we perceive its aspect, a mental image or impression of the object. For example, when we see a vase, there is an image of the vase that arises in our mind, and that image is the aspect. The Great Exposition, on the other hand, posits that when we perceive an object, our consciousness engages it directly. The as­pect is thus more like what we think about it. For example, when contemplating the five aggregates of grasping, nobles consider them as impermanent, suffering, and so forth, so those are the aspects. Since this is in essence full knowing— distinguishing the true nature of the object— the Great Exposition posits that the aspects are fullknowing.299. N ot Unable, four actual practices, and special dhyana.300. The previous six plus the first three levels of Formless.301. T hat is, mind and mental factors.302. Prince Yas'omitra provides an example: someone who on the support of N ot U n­able becomes detached from Desire and achieves the first dhyana attains two future relative knowings: one of N ot Unable (the level of the path) and one of the first dhyana (the level attained for the first time). (Tengyur ngu pa, 262).303. In Yasomitras example, when someone on the support of the second dhyana be­comes detached and attains the third dhyana, the path (the path of liberation over the ninth discard of the second dhyana) is on the level of the second dhyana. The level that is attained by removal of attachment is the third dhyana. Upon achieving that level, the yogi attains undefiled knowings of the level of the path (the second dhyana), the attained level (the third dhyana), and also the lower levels such as the first dhyana, special dhyana, and N ot Unable. (Tengyur ngu pa, 262-263).304. Mikyo Dorje explains this example further: when you cut the cords that bind a basket, it springs back to shape as if it were a living thing. (Mi bskyod rdo rje 2005, vol. 3, 290)305. The Great Exposition holds that the Bodhisattva can only attain complete awak­ening to Buddhahood on the support of a male body. W omen attain a male body (in a future life) in order to completely awaken. See IV. 109. This position is not necessarily accepted by all schools of Buddhism.620"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"NOTES ON AREA VII306. The way all dharmas are divided into ten categories is described above in VII.i8ab: there are concurrent and nonconcurrent dharmas for each of the three realms and the undefiled, virtuous noncom pound, and neutral noncompound.307.

T hat is, other than the resultant touches of soft, rough, and so forth described in I.lOd.309. Here tikas refers to Indian commentaries in general, not specifically to Mikyo Dorje’s commentary.310. T hat is, compassion is in essence nonhatred and great compassion is nondelusion. Compassion focuses on one realm and great compassion on three. Compassion has the one suffering o f suffering as its aspect, and great compassion all three types of suf­fering. Compassion is on all four dhyanas; great compassion on the fourth. Compas­sion is found among the listeners and great compassion among the Victors. Compassion is attained by detaching from Desire; great compassion by detaching from the Peak of Existence. The compassion o f the listeners and self-buddhas does not have the power to fully protect beings from samsara, but great compassion does. Compassion sees suffering beings partially; great compassion sees all beings impartially. (Mi bskyod rdo rje 2005, vol. 3, 308)311. Such as discards of seeing. See VI.58ab.312.

In the third, attention on complete withdrawal, one discards the three greater sets of meditative discards. In the fourth, attention on taking delight, one feels joy and pleasure at having abandoned the greater discards and discards the three medium sets of discards. In the fifth, attention on examination, one examines oneself to see which discards remain. In the sixth, attention on the end of training, one abandons the three lesser meditative discards.

Not only does the Karmapas concise yet elegant explanation explain all the major details of Vasubandhu’s text, it also provides synopses of debates among different schools that provide just enough detail for new students to understand the main points without overwhelming them. The translation is clear and easy to understand, and yet rigorous in its consistency and accuracy.Of these three trainings, the primary one for destroying the afflictions and attaining the ultimate result is the superior training in full knowing. Developing this training depends mainly on the pitaka of abhidharma, and that in turn depends mainly on the treatises of abhidharma. Of all these treatises, the easiest and clearest is the Treasury of Abhidharma, so if you study the Treasury, it will bring great benefit.— f r o m t h e f o r e w o r d b y Khenchen Thrangu RinpocheFrom karma to states of meditation, world systems to the workings of our minds—Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Abhidharma examines the key topics of Buddhism, carefully, thoroughly, and concisely. The Ninth Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje’s commentary elucidates Vasubandhu’s text in a way that is accessible to those new to abhidharma studies and also satisfying to those seeking a deeper understanding. Both texts are capably translated by David Karma Choephel, whose rendering of the root verses in meter is both melodic and mnemonic. Whether we are interested in madhyamaka studies or practicing mahamudra, studying Jewels from the Treasury will provide us with insight into the topics that are the foundation of all the Buddhist systems of philosophy and meditation.— E l i z a b e t h M.
