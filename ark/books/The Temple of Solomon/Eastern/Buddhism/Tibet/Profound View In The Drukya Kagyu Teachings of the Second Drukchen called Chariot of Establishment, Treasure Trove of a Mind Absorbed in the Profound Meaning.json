The book is based on a collection of oral instructions given by the second Drukchen, head of the Drukpa Kagyu lineage during the fifteenth century A.D., and recorded by one of his disciples. The second Drukchen had a number of names. One of them was \"Gyalwang Je\". t. �� Poaeu of tie �� 1'teet.t of �eattt, &� As the title of the book indicates, much of the teaching in it is for the purpose of determining the profound view of reality. There are a number of books available at the moment that have the same purpose but most of them present their determination of the view within the conventional framework of Buddhist teaching. Their presentations always rely on valid logic as the way to determine the view correctly. This book is unique in its determinations of the view using the unconventional tantric approach. In the conventional approach of non-tantric teachings, \"the view\" always refers the conceptual understanding of reality that a practi­tioner develops and uses as a basis for their practice, practice which is intended to re-unite them with reality. However, in the tantric"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"16 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU approach, \"the view\" additionally refers to that reality known in direct perception. The tantric system has a unique and very special technique in which the guru introduces the disciple to reality directly; he does something so that the disciple gets a glimpse of reality in direct perception, not as a mere conceptual understand­ing. The name for this technique is called \"introduction to the view\". Once the disciple has been given a direct taste of the view through this special type of introduction\\ that view henceforth guides the disciples practice of re-uniting with reality. Both non­tantric and tantric teachings speak of the \"ultimate view\" but the non-tantric, conventional system always gives a logical presenta­tion, even if that presentation is extraordinary subtle and precise. The tantric system does use words to present the view in the same way but, by definition, it relies on the special technique just men­tioned so that the final presentation of the ultimate view is known not through analysis but through direct experience. This difference in the style of understanding of \"view\" that exists between the conventional siltra system and the unconventional tan­tric system leads to another key point. The validity of the view known through logic cannot withstand the validity of the view known through direct experience of reality. The second Drukchen raises this point repeatedly in his debates with the scholars that visit him to argue about the view and uses it very effectively to de­feat them. The Drukchen apparently did have a mind that was ab­sorbed in the profound view, as the title of the text of his teachings states, and thus could use this key point to subdue people who in­sisted on their merely conceptually-understood view of profound reality The text included here records his brilliant way of doing so on a number of occasions. 1 Tib. ngo sprod, commonly called \"pointing out\" but the term means \"introduction\"."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 17 There is a very valuable side effect of the second Drukchen' s use of this key point to uphold the view known through direct perception as the ultimate one. As he debates with his visitors who are cling­ing to the logically understood view of reality, he highlights many of the key differences between the conventional approach that relies on a view known in conceptual understanding and the unconven­tional one that relies on a view known in direct perception. Leaving that aside, the second Drukchen's teachings clarify another issue concerning the view that is frequently misunderstood. The highest tantric teachings for deity practice, called the Highest Yoga Tantras, are divided into three: mother tantra, father tantra, and non-dual tantra. The division occurs because the tantras of each of the three groups collectively have a particular emphasis on how to realize the view. Because of the differing emphases, it could seem as though the ultimate view is different for each type of tantra. However, the ultimate view of all tantras within the Highest Yoga Tantra is the same, it just that the expression of the view has a dif­ferent emphasis in each of the three cases. The second Drukchen explains the differences and how the differences are really just fac­ets of the same, ultimate view. This raises a point about the view of the Kagyus in general. The Kagyu schools in general place a great emphasis on the practice of mother tantra and generally give their explanations of the view ac­cordingly. Even the sutras and treatises on them that they use as the main textbooks for their tradition are affected by this choice. Anyone familiar with the Kagyu approach will probably be familiar with this mother tantra approach even to the point of mistakenly thinking that the particular emphasis of mother tantra is the view of all Highest Yoga Tantras. The teachings here of the second Druk­chen will clarify what the view of Highest Yoga Tantra is and how mother tantra emphasises a particular aspect of that, something that will be helpful for any Kagyu practitioner."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"18 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU Then, of the three types of Highest Yoga Tantra, non-dual tantra has the most direct presentation of the ultimate view, not mother or father tantra. There is only one non-dual tantra, that of Kala­chakra2, though there are many mother and father tantras. The sec­ond Drukchen' s teachings included here give many presentations of the view specifically according to the non-dual approach, which, as just mentioned, is the approach of the Kalachakra tantra. This view has not been well-presented up till now in the West, so this is a further point of clarification contained in the teachings here. Moreover, the compiler of the Drukchen' s teachings included a number of other teachings given in relation to Kalachakra, each of which presents another specific detail about the non-dual view and some of which give very interesting information about the Kala­chakra system. Leaving that aside, there is another important facet of the Kagyu view that is exposed in the Drukchen' s teachings but which will not be immediately evident. It is called the \"Other Empty\" system. The Drukpa Kagyu style of presentation of the view embodies and upholds the Other Empty approach the same as all other Kagyu schools. However, and unlike other Kagyu schools such as the Karma Kagyu, the Drukpa Kagyu does not use the words \"Other 2 The highest tantras were brought into Tibet in two waves. The first was at the time of the first spread of Buddhadharma in Tibet. The tantras brought in at that time were connected with the ultimate view expressed through teachings called Maha Ati (Dzogchen). The Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism is connected with them. The second wave was at the time of the second spread of Buddhadharma in Tibet. The tantras brought in at that time were connected with the ultimate view expressed through teachings called Mahamudra. The Kagyu, Sakya, and Gelug schools of Tibetan Buddhism are connected with them. There are many non-dual tantras that came in the first wave and are connected with the Maha Ati expression of the view but there is only one that came with the second wave and is connected with its Mahamudra teachings, that of Kalachakra."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION Empty\" in its presentation. Thus, another feature of the presenta­tions of view in here is that the \"Other Empty\" approach is clearly demonstrated, even though the term is not used. 19 The \"Other Empty\" approach was a very contentious issue within Tibet and many works that trenchantly upheld or denied it were published. Because of this, Westerners have developed the idea that \"Other Empty\" is all about hard-headed philosophy. It is not. In fact, it is a style of presenting the view that seeks to get past the logical approach that can so easily dog the conventional approach of Buddhism and in doing so is very much in accord with the ulti­mate approach of the tantras. This fits: the Kagyu approach is that, as explained earlier, the tantric approach is the ultimate one so expressions of the view that either tend toward or are in harmony with that are used. \"Other Empty\" is therefore very much part of the Kagyu presentation. Here, the \"Other Empty\" approach is not seen as part of a text that is designed to argue the validity of the approach but is seen as a living quality within the expression of the view. This is important. It needs to be understood that \"Other Empty\" could descend into philosophical argument but actually is a practical way of expressing the view that really is used by practi­tioners on the way to enlightenment. That is a small summary of important features of the second Druk­chen' s teachings contained in here in relation to specific issues of the view. The Kagyu tradition of Tibet began in the eleventh century with Marpa the Translator. He travelled to India where he received extensive teachings from great masters of the time-and returned to Tibet with them. The transmission of those teachings in Tibet"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"20 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU became known as the Kagyu tradition, meaning \"the tradition of instructions given as commands for practice\". The hallmark of the Kagyu tradition has always been that of practice and of secret man­tra (the actual practice of the tantras) in particular, following the oral instructions of the guru. The followers of the system in India and originally in Tibet, too, were lay-people who did not follow the monastic system intended to create the causes of a later enlighten­ment but who followed the yogic system of the tantras intended to gain enlightenment by practising enlightenment itself in the pres­ent. Marpa had four main disciples but passed the lineage primarily to one called Milarepa, who became the most famous of yogins throughout Tibet. Milarepa similarly had several disciples but pas­sed the lineage primarily to one called Gampopa. Gampopa on the other hand passed the lineage to several disciples which resulted in the development of several new lineages of the Kagyu tradition. Gampopa had three yogin disciples who were very highly accom­plished. They were a group of three men from the East of Tibet. One of them was called \"Grey Hair from the East\". He and his sub­sequent incarnations were known as Karmapa and his lineage, the Karma Kagyu, became the central pillar of the various Kagyu schools that developed in Tibet. The second of the three men from the East was Phagmo Drupa. Most of the Kagyu lineages that came to exist other than the Karma Kagyu started with him and his great disciples. The third of the three men from the East was Saltong Shogom. Unlike the other two, he did not have many disciples and no lineages of Kagyu developed from him or his subsequent incar­nations. His incarnations have been known as Traleg Rinpoche in more recent times. One of the disciples of Phagmo Drupa was Tsangpa Gyare. He was famous for having an extraordinarily large number of students."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION One of them was a yogin called Lingje Repa. The transmission of Kagyu teachings from Phagmo Drupa through Tsangpa Gyare to Lingje Repa and then on from him became another Kagyu lineage called the Drukpa Kagyu. 21 It has been common in Tibet for the incarnations of the founder of a lineage to be found quickly and for that and subsequent incarna­tions to be installed as the hierarchs who carry on the lineage. However, the Drukpa Kagyu lineage has an unusual history. Fol­lowing Tsangpa Gyare there was Lingje Repa and then many other lineage holders of the lineage who were great masters but not incar­nations of the Tsangpa Gyare. It was not until two hundred and fifty years after Tsangpa Gyare that his first incarnation was recog­nized. That first, recognized incarnation was enthroned as the head of the Drukpa Kagyu and since then, and in accordance with the system of Tibetan spiritual culture, an unbroken succession of incar­nations have appeared, been recognized, and enthroned as the head of the lineage. These emanations of Tsangpa Gyare have always been given the title \"Drukchen\" or \"The Great Drukpa\" meaning the greatest of the Drukpas, the person at the helm of the Drukpa Kagyu lineage. The title Drukchen is a specific title given only to the head of the Drukpa Kagyu lineage. Besides that title indicating rank within the lineage, the Drukchens have also always been accorded the title \"Gyalwang\". The term Gyalwang is a translation of the Sanskrit \"Jinendra\" meaning \"the conqueror who rules over and leads all the other conquerors\". This is an ancient Indian title that was taken up in Tibetan culture and used as a title for only a few beings of particularly high spiritual realization. There are many titles and epithets in Tibetan language indicating people of great knowledge and attainment. Many of these were given out easily, according to the view of the students of a teacher or political needs. However, this very high title Gyalwang has not been indiscriminately handed"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"22 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU out; anyone who has the title is universally recognized within Ti­betan Buddhism not only as a spiritual leader by protocol but one of the truly great spiritual beings in the culture. As you might be expect, only a few masters in the whole period of Tibetan history have been given the title \"Gyalwang\". The main ones have been: the Karmapa who has been the head of the Karma Kagyu tradition during his seventeen successive incarnations and who is regarded either as the highest or second highest of Tibetan lamas (he is usually called \"Gyalwang Karmapa\"); the Dalai Lama who has been the spiritual head of the Tibetan people through four­teen incarnations (he is usually called \"Precious Gyalwang\"); and the Drukchen who has been the head of the Drukpa Kagyu through eleven incarnations and who is usually called just \"Gyalwang\" or \"Gyalwang Drukpa\". Not much has been known about the Druk­chens and their lineage, the Drukpa Kagyu, in the West up till now but this should help to give a sense of just how highly regarded they are within Tibetan culture. The Drukpa Kagyu lineage in Tibet was regarded as the consum­mate lineage when it came to actually practising and attaining real­ization. Of course, historically everyone tends to say that their lin­eage is the ultimate practice lineage. However, this statement about the Drukpa Kagyu is not mere badge-polishing by the lineage itself nor the proud words of a sympathiser. It really was the case in Ti­bet that the Drukpa Kagyu was regarded as the consummate prac­tice lineage, so much so that this saying appeared and spread throughout Tibet: \"Half the valley are Drukpas, Half of them live in caves (practising yoga), Half of them (the ones practising in caves) have com­pleted the path.\""},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION The Drukchens have never been seen as the mere titular heads of the lineage but as the exemplars of it. One after the other, and like the successive incarnations of the Karmapas who are well-known outside of Tibet, the Drukchens demonstrated extraordinary spiri­tual attainment, understanding, and abilities. 23 From the time that the Kagyu lineage appeared in Tibet, Kagyu practitioners in general were known not for scholarship but for the practise of secret mantra and direct understanding of reality throu­gh their tradition's ultimate practice, Mahamudra. This has been true within the Drukpa Kagyu in particular. Nonetheless, many practitioners have appeared within the various Kagyu lineages who have been renowned for their mastery of both scholarship and practice. The Drukchens have always been known for their mastery of prac­tice but all of them have been known for their incisive intelligence, too, and the ability to express the dharma clearly. Some of them have also been known for outstanding scholarship as well. The fourth Drukchen, Padma Karpo, was one of the outstanding siddha-scholars of his century. He was so expert in scholarship that he was given the title Kun-khyen, a title which is reserved in Ti­betan culture for the one or two masters in any given century who literally \"know it all3\". Kunkhyen Padma Karpo as he is called, was such a masterful scholar that his prolific writings became known throughout all schools of Tibetan Buddhism and are still used in schools other than the Drukpa Kagyu, today. The second Drukchen, Kunga Paljor, lived from 1428-1476 A.D. and gave the oral teachings that are presented in this text. He is 3 Sometimes translated as omniscient but that is a mistake, it has the mean­ing of \"knowing everything there is to know in areas of study\". There are other terms for someone who has the omniscient quality of a buddha."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"24 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU most frequently known by the epithet Gyalwang Je, meaning \"The Lord Gyalwang\" with Gyalwang being the high title for all of the Drukchens as mentioned previously. He is remembered in the Drukpa Kagyu as a siddha of very high accomplishment and as someone who also had a brilliant mastery of the buddhist teachings at all levels. He was not the scholar-type of vast learning who pro­duced a great literary corpus like Padma Karpo; his collected, writ­ten works are contained in just two volumes. Despite the small size, his collected works show his reputed mastery over the practice of secret mantra. And many of them, including the one translated here, show that he had did have a remarkable knowledge of the Buddhist tradition in general and that he could present his realiza­tion, using the language of scholars when needed, to give clear and sometimes breathtakingly sharp clarifications of the view. The text translated here contains over sixty of Gyalwang Je's oral teachings on the view. The teachings were heard by his disciple, Sonam Chogden, who transcribed them and arranged them into a single text called \"Chariot of Establishment\", Treasure Trove of a Mind Absorbed in the Profound Meaning. The words of the title \"Treasure Trove\" refer to the fact that this is a veritable treasure trove of teachings on the view, containing as it does more than sixty separate teachings on a variety of topics, with every teaching a mine of information on the view. The presentations of the view in the text are presentations of the views of both conventional and ultimate systems taught by the Buddha that is, presentations of the view of the teachings of both sutra and tantra. However, the teachings are given from the per­spective that the tantric system is the ultimate system of the Bud-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION dha's teaching, since the tantric system shows the view of reality most directly. 25 A mind that is absorbed in direct knowledge of the profound real­ity pointed at by those teachings knows that reality definitively and can therefore speak about it in a way that brings humans into direct contact with it. This text is a treasure trove of teachings that arose from the Drukchen, given that his mind was absorbed in direct knowledge of that profound reality. Moreover, the teachings that were selected for this compilation were ones that had the quality of establishing, quite definitively, the view of this profound reality. Therefore, there is the sub-title of the book, \"Chariot of Establishment\". \"Establishment\" refers to the use of some means, not necessarily logic, to establish the view and \"Chariot\" is derived from the ancient Indian Buddhist way of speaking in which anything that was a major force in presenting a teaching or view, anything that definitively established a system of the view, was called a chariot. In colloquial English, it would be something like \"The Massive Locomotive of Establishment\" mean­ing the juggernaut that has the power to establish the view and, because it is correct, does have the right to mow down everything in its way. The word \"Establishment\" is particularly pertinent and leads us into a discussion of the style of the book. Normally, in the Tibetan tradition, the title \"Chariot of Establishment\" would immediately suggest that the contents of the text were the logical argument that became the hallmark of Tsong khapa and his followers, who tended to view and argue everything using the views and logical methods of the sutra system. The really interesting quality of this text is that Gyalwang Je does use the logical methods of those who insist on following the sutras and arguing from that perspective but uses those methods to show that, in the end, the understanding that they"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"26 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU lead to is not the ultimate understanding. In other words, he uses the methods of sutra as a means for drawing out the ultimate view of the tantras. And moreover, he often uses this logic to show the mistakes of detractors who were clinging to the logic and the un­derstanding it provides. I said just above that the presentations of the view in the text are presentations of the views of both conventional and ultimate sys­tems taught by the Buddha, that is, presentations of the view of the teachings of both sutra and tantra. However, the teachings in Gyal­wang Je's text are presented from the perspective that the tantric system is the ultimate system of the Buddha's teaching, the one that shows the view of reality most directly. This perspective is that of the Kagyu school in general. Remember that the Kagyu school is primarily a yogic school where the conventional teachings of sutra are understood but where the tantric teachings are accepted as the fact of the practitioner's life. The Kagyus are not scholars who assess both systems logically using the methods of sutra then de­cide to follow tantra, all the while keeping their logical, sutra-style minds. To the contrary, they are people who see that the sutras have a way of getting to reality using the rational mind and who have said, \"Fine, that's a good teaching but we do not wish to fol­low that style of teaching\". They have made the decision to jump wholeheartedly into the tantric system's way of getting to reality and will now follow a style which does not rely on rational mind as the means to get to reality. Thus, the presentations of the view in this book do not come from the perspective of someone who is us­ing the rational approach of the sutras to assess reality in the sutra system and the tantric systems both. Not at all. The Kagyus-and the Nyingmas likewise-see that kind of approach as a major error and simply do not do it. Kagyus and Nyingmas in general, when presenting the view, do it like this. When they present the sutra tradition, they present it us-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 27 ing the terminology and approach of that system and when they present the tantra tradition they use the distinct terminology and approach of that system. Gyalwang Je does just that. In that sense, his writings are perfectly representative of the Kagyu view. This approach has hardly, if at all, been seen in print in English so far, so the text here is quite important. Why make an issue of this? Well, as Gyalwang Je himself says on several occasions, a school or schools of Buddhism in Tibet by his time had descended into setting the view of the sutra system as the highest view and then always presenting everything in those terms, even to the extent of overlaying the view and terminology of that system over the unique and higher systems of the tantras. He takes issue-as do the Kagyus and Nyingmas in general-with this kind of approach. It is generally seen by them as a mistake of fairly large proportions. Of course, these issues could be addressed in argu­ment between the two parties. However, what has happened in Tibet over the centuries is that when parties of the two different ap­proaches encounter each other, the parties that prefer the rational, highly logical approach of the sutras, tend to be blinded to the non­logical immediacy of the tantric tradition by the very logic that they place such high emphasis upon. This can and did lead to intellec­tual dishonesty, then righteousness over one's own view, then to very strong emotions. Those strong emotions can and did lead to abuse and even warfare against the other school of the opposing party. It is evident from reading Gyalwang Je that his ability to argue us­ing the logical forms that fit with the sutra tradition (syllogism, and so on) is just as good as any scholar. In other words, just because he has aligned himself with and finally prefers the unique system of the tantras, he is not scholastically corrupt. If anything, it seems the other way around. It is stated over and again in the tantric tradi­tion that direct, non-logical access to reality does not consist of in-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"28 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU sight primarily into emptiness, as seems to be presented by some followers of the sutras. To the contrary, the direct perception of reality in the tantras is one that embraces both appearance and emptiness in a fully immediate way4• As is said, \"One thing eluci­dates all\", a tantric inspired phrase meaning, \"If you can contact that underlying wisdom5 which is your own reality, then, without 4 There are many specialized terms for that in the tantras and Gyalwang Je presents many of them on numerous occasions in here. I am resorting to the slightly more sutra-flavoured words here just so that the moderately informed reader can follow. 5 Wisdom in this book is used only as a translation of the Buddhist term jfiana in Sanskrit. It does not refer at all to the wisdom of a person with a lot of experience or learning that is, it is not like \"oh, he is a wise man (be­cause he is old and knows a lot\". It is a most special word that means liter­ally \"knowing\" but refers to that type of knowing which is at the very core of what ordinary people call mind. This type of knowing is not a concep­tual, dualistic knowing at all. It is the kind of knowing that a person is left with after they eradicate dualistic, rational mind. It is exactly that kind of knower which a buddha has. The word was translated into Tibetan with 'ye shes' meaning the kind of consciousness which is there from the beginning, even before a being made the fundamental mistake of developing a dualistic mind for himself. It has been translated as primordial awareness, and so on but it has the meaning of that kind of knowing which was there before dualistic mind, is there at the root of dualistic mind, and will be there after dualistic mind is gone. It is primordial in the sense that it is the root knower that is always there, whether dualistic mind is present or not. A person who has access to their own \"wisdom\" has access to an unre­stricted ability to know and understand. That ability can be quite magical compared to the abilities of a person who only has recourse to a dualistic mind, no matter how sharp the faculties of the dualistic mind might be. In the end, a person with access to their wisdom knows reality as it is, where­as a person using the logic of intellect can only ever conjecture about that reality. This is the very essence of this book and the very essence of the view that Gyalwang Je is expressing. Wisdom in the end is what knows reality directly and fully. That can never be achieved by staying within (continued ... )"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 29 reading any books at all, you can know everything\". That trans­lates in the current case to the possibility that someone like Gyal­wang Je could, in the middle of an argument, slice the mistakes in an opponent's position to shreds without recourse to the lesser strength of rational-style logic but through the extraordinary quali­ties of wisdom itself present in his own mind. If you have not seen this, it can be hard to understand, but I have been with many great beings of the Kagyu and Nyingma traditions who, even though they do not have the intellectual knowledge of a subject, are able to produce the understanding necessary to overcome an opponent on the spot and purely on the basis of the non-conceptual wisdom that they have. It is astonishing to see, especially for those of us who have grown up through the rigours of Western, rational-minded training. People bent on logic, whether they are scholars of Buddhism prac­tising the true path or not, can easily be offended by someone's ap­parent lack of rational learning. They will tend to claim that the person concerned really doesn't understand the view because of their lack of rational approach to it. Then, when their opponent starts to exhibit extraordinary abilities at argument which either match or exceed their own, they run up against the wall of their own intellect. If they are lucky, this turns into an opportunity in which they realize their own mistake of relying on logic instead of the non-rational, past-logical thing (called wisdom) being pointed out by the logic. If they are unlucky, they will not be able to deal with it and any of several emotional responses will ensue. Both possibilities came to pass in Tibet. There are plenty of stories in the various Tibetan lineages of masters whose direct access to wisdom enabled them to subdue beings who were caught in their dualistic 5 ( •.. continued) logical means and those logical means can never in the end withstand the arguments brought on by wisdom."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"30 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU minds. Often, the opponent would become a disciple because of it. On the other hand, self-righteous people with smaller minds, peo­ple affected by excesses of logic, did lose the basic, Buddhist mes­sage of non-aggression, and did attempt to overpower and/ or elim­inate their opponents who did not agree with their insistence that everything in Buddhism should be done from the perspective of a rational, logical mind. The Kagyu and Nyingma lineages bore the brunt of vicious attacks because of it. Gyalwang Je's abilities at argument, whether they come from some rational learning that he did or from the immediacy of his realiza­tion, rival that of any learned scholar. His knowledge of the view, again whether from rational learning or wisdom, is also very exten­sive and profound. Thus his presentation of the view is quite rigor­ous even if very terse in many places. Again though, he does not fall into the trap of allowing the conventional approaches of the siitra tradition-which just fit perfectly with logical scholarship-to override the profound view that Buddhism presents in either siitra or tantra. He presents the innermost view of Buddhism and shows how it relates to the outer view of the conventional teachings of Buddhism in a way that cannot be argued with. He shows the view exactly of the Kagyu tradition and does so according to the style of the Kagyu tradition. The Drukchens were not given the rare title Gyalwang simply as a matter of tradition but, as with the Karmapa, because of their great­ness of realization. This point is important to this book. The pre­sentations of the view that Gyalwang Je makes here are often given using the forms of logical scholarship but are not mere scholarship or polemics. The logical forms are always used to highlight the point that logical scholarship does not and cannot get to the pro­found meaning. Again and again he uses logic only to go past it and point to the core of ultimate realization. It is obvious from his"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION style of teaching that he is giving a view coming from realization and not just from books. 31 For a long time now, the view of Tibetan Buddhism that has been presented and popularly accepted in the West has been the view of the established church of Tibet with a strong emphasis that the view expressed in the highest logical system of the siitras, the Prasangika Madhyamaka, is the ultimate view of Buddhism both for siitra and tantra. These presentations come with the sense that this is the only correct way to understand-definitively-the Bud­dha's teaching. However, the Kagyus and Nyingmas, and in some cases the Sakyas too, do not agree with this popularly accepted presentation. The Western students of these schools have been learning the approaches of their own schools quietly and have not written much about their own view. As mentioned before, this is the style of these schools-they are more interested in practise of the view and have less time for scholarship. Still, the texts of these schools have been starting to appear and with them the alternate presentations of the view that are favoured by these traditions that were not the established church in Tibet. This text joins these publi­cations. It marks an important departure from what has appeared so far because it gives, in a very pithy but precise way, the view of the Kagyu school in reference to both conventional and unconven­tional levels of teaching of the Buddha. Those who are not familiar with the view except as expressed by the established church of Tibet, the Gelugpa tradition, might be very surprised at some of the arguments and definitions in here. Gyalwang Je is presenting the view of the Kagyu system itself and it does happen to differ from some of the presentations of Tsongkhapa and his followers. When you know enough about the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"32 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU differences between their views, you will be able to find many places where Gyalwang Je is arguing incisively against their kind of approach. However, and this is a key point, this is not a text de­signed to show that the view of another school is wrong and belittle or eliminate the other thereby. It is a presentation that straightfor­wardly establishes the view of his own, Kagyu school, and should be taken on that basis. I would like to add here that this introduction is in the same vein. I have been asked to elucidate these matters in a foreword even though I don't wish to make an issue of them and in fact, in many ways I prefer not to discuss them. So I would like to state clearly here that in raising these points, I am not arguing against anyone but simply observing that there are differences. It is probably also important to mention that I have studied for many years with teachers of Gelugpa, Kagyu, and Nyingma traditions and have only the greatest respect for the dharma, meaning the truth, that I learn­ed from each of them. Nonetheless, if you want to get at the view, it is not enough simply to say that there are differences. You have to look into the different approaches and find out where the definitive answer lies. One of the problems in Tibet, like in any other place where there are sen­tient beings, was that people clung to their views and insisted that, just because their logic appeared to be impeccable, the view being proved by it must be correct. Or they would use the force of the fact that their school was the established one with lots of power be­hind it so it had to be followed. Well, what did the Buddha himself say about determining the view? There is a very famous teaching of the Buddha in which he stated what should and should not be taken as reliable when trying to"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 33 find out definitively what is true. The axioms are the four reliances6: \"Do not rely on the person, rely on the words; Do not rely on the words, rely on the meaning; Do not rely on provisional meaning, rely on the defini­tive meaning; Do not rely on consciousness, rely on wisdom.\" This applies here like this: just because a person or certain school of thought is well-known or its view has a pre-eminent position is not sufficient to mean that its position should be accepted as correct. Instead, the assertions of the school should be looked at. But even that is not enough; just because the words sound good the position expressed should not be taken as correct, rather the meaning of the assertions should be looked at. But even that is not enough; mean­ings can be either provisional or definitive and one should look for the definitive meaning, not the provisional one. However, even that is not enough; the logical presentations of consciousness (ratio­nal mind) might be correct in their own sphere but, because they are dualistic presentations, they may fail in the face of wisdom it­self. That is in many ways what this book is about. It is saying that, in the final analysis, no matter how correct logical mind might be, it cannot, just as the Buddha said, match the insight of wisdom itself. I mentioned above that I have studied extensively with teachers of Gelugpa, Kagyu, and Nyingma traditions. When there has been an apparent discrepancy in the views, I have used the above words of the Buddha to resolve that discrepancy. Sometimes it has taken a lot of time and study for it to come clear but the above teaching has been able to point the way in every case; it is a very powerful teach­ing. In short, just because a certain view has become well-known in the West is not a valid reason for assuming-or stating-that it is cor-6 The four axioms are clearly presented by Gyalwang Je on page 271."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"34 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU rect. Similarly, just because a certain teacher has become popular does not mean that his view is correct. There are other views and hero worship is not the point; it behoves everyone concerned to examine the matter impartially. The view of the Kagyu and Nyingma is often connected with or styled as what is called \"Zhantong\"7• Zhantong is not a word that comes from the Indian Buddhist tradition. It started out as a phras­ing of several Tibetan words in a statement made in the thirteenth century by a great Kalachakra yogin. The phrasing turned out to be a very good way to indicate a certain understanding of the view, so it was condensed to the Tibetan word \"zhantong\". That word entered the language over time and ended up as a key term when describing the view, at least for some Tibetan schools. Major forces within and aligned with the Gelugpa tradition have, for many centuries, claimed that Zhantong is a wrong understand­ing and have refuted it vigorously since its appearance. When the Gelugpa tradition presents the view according to their own system, they simply do not have the word \"Zhantong\" in the vocabulary of their presentation. Amongst their many refutations of the view connected with Zhantong, they say that the word has never existed in the words coming from the Buddha. This is specious argument because the term itself is a descriptive one, a convenience that points at a certain approach to the view. Since that is so, anyone claiming that there is something wrong with the term is effectively saying that one could never use the devices of one's own language to try to highlight the meaning of the Buddha's words. Taken to 7 Tib. gzhan stong: \"other empty\" meaning \"something being empty of that which is other than what it is itself\"."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 35 the absurd, it would mean that Tibetans themselves could not use of Tibetan words that did not exist in India to discuss the Buddha's teaching. Despite the position of the established church of Tibet on the subject of Zhantong, the Kagyu and Nyingma altogether, and some Sakya scholars too, do support the view of Zhantong and do claim that this is the view of their tradition. How do the Drukpa Kagyu ap­proach this and what does Gyalwang Je do with it? None of the early presentations of the Buddhist traditions of Tibet used the word Zhantong simply because the phrase was not part of Indian Buddhist terminology and because the term had not yet been coined and come into use in Tibet. However, the presenta­tions of the Kagyu and Nyingma are full of particular wordings that evoke the idea \"zhantong\" and overall, their view is what later was called Zhantong, even if that specific wording was not used in earlier times. Later presentations of the view in both Kagyu and Nyingma sometimes explicitly use the word and sometimes not though the basic presentations are still the same and still are what came to be called Zhantong. For example, the Drukpa Kagyu tradi­tion does present the Kagyu view but does not use the word Zhan­tong, even to this day, in presenting that view. They are a school who just use the original words as they have have been handed down since the time of Marpa and Milarepa. The Karma Kagyu tradition on the other hand came to use the term Zhantong regu­larly as a way of describing the Kagyu view. Authors such as Karmapa Mikyo Dorje and Jamgon Lodro Thaye used the term in their texts on the view and made many clear statements to the effect that their predecessors, the forefathers of the Kagyu had exactly that view. Thus Gyalwang Je's text is interesting because it shows the Kagyu way of presenting its zhantong-style view without reference to the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"36 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU word \"zhantong\" at all. The first chapter in particular gives a clas­sic presentation of the Kagyu view, showing how the school views the three, outer turnings of the wheel of dharma and the fourth, inner turning of it. It is given in a very simple but precise way which, unless you are familiar with all of the issues that have been raised over these matters, seems deceptively simple. What might not be apparent is the elegance of his simultaneous presentation of his own school's view and incisive refutation of the position of the established church. The cleverness of his presentation with refuta­tion is hard to see unless you already know the views and argu­ments of the various schools involved but it really is amazing the way he has done it. The brilliance of this piece is not just that he does both at once with a great economy of expression but that he does not go out of his way to defend himself or negate anyone else's position. He presents his view clearly and precisely, at the same time speaking in such a way that his opponent's views are negated without him uttering a negative word. The Kagyus do not need to be convinced of their view. However, as mentioned above, there has been acrimonious debate around this point since the time that the established church started to take issue with the presentations of other schools whose presentations dif­fered from their own, so it is always interesting to see what the great beings of the various Kagyu lineages have to say on the mat­ter. If you sum up Gyalwang Je's style, he presents the Kagyu view as it has been done from the beginning within the lineage as a zhan­tong-style presentation. Some Kagyus prefer to use the term zhan­tong and others not. Gyalwang Je makes his presentation without the use of the word zhantong. And it turns out (through extensive study of the texts of and discussion with the gurus of the tradition) that this is the approach of the Drukpa Kagyu lineage in general. Moreover, he presents his arguments in the style of his lineage which is practise of the yogas of the tantric path. His presentation presents the quality that his lineage had little time or interest in"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION heavy-handed negation of other's views and expresses a general attitude of non-aggression in that regard. 37 As intimated earlier, some Tibetan schools, or at least some power­ful people in or related with those schools, did try to refute and de­stroy other religious traditions in Tibet. This is not a mere story: the Drukpa Kagyu tradition, which originally flourished in Central Ti­bet, was nearly destroyed when powerful figures in the central gov­ernment, who only believed in the teachings of the established church headquartered in Central Tibet, walked in and simply took over many of the Drukpa Kagyu monasteries in the central region, replacing the spiritual system in force with the one, just mentioned, of their own liking. There is an interesting point here. One well-known activity of the established church was that it vigorously attempted to destroy any­thing connected with the system of Zhantong. Now, the established church tends to be attached to the logical system of un­dermining another's position by showing the consequences of the opponents position and how those consequences could not be tena­ble8. If one turns that logic back on the established church, you get the following. Anyone from the established church of Tibet that refutes the Zhantong system, not only refutes those who explicitly formulated and advocated Zhantong in Tibet (the followers of the Jonangpa School as they are called) but also refutes the entire Kagyu School and its approach because they too proclaim that they are a Zhantong school. However, the established church obtained nearly all of its tantric transmission and original view of the tantras from the Kagyu gurus of its founder, Tsongkhapa. Therefore it is a consequence of their refutation of the Zhantong system that they are also refuting the basis of their own system!! 8 this is called prasanga"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"38 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU My refutation there was not done out of wanting to reduce the other school but simply, in passing, to point out that there might be a problem with their approach. Gyalwang Je and many other great masters of schools other than the established church have taken the same approach when writing about their own view. They wish to present the view of their school but are constantly \"bothered\" by voices who are attempting to drag them down. Unlike those voices, they have no interest in or need to abolish those other schools-live and let live-however, they do on occasion, as I have just done, use the very logical methods favoured by their detractors to point out the absurdity of their detractor's position. Again, this is the quality of this text. The teachings in it are those of a great master presenting the view of his own tradition but his times had already seen excesses of one, established tradition trying to elimi­nate or at least undermine others so at some point, some reply by him is inevitable, even if that is not really the point at hand. �-7ie 'P� 1'teet.t u de �'[)«at 1'teet.t When glossing the meaning of the title earlier, I pointed out the words \"Profound Meaning\" referred to the fact that the view ex­pressed in this text is the view of the tantras, not of the siitras. However, there is a little more to it. Another key point of this book is that it presents a lot of the view from the perspective of the Kalachakra tantra. The new translation system held in the Kagyu and Sakya schools and then in the Gelugpa school following them, divides the Buddha's teaching into siitra and tantra. It then divides the tantras into four sections, three of which are outer and one of"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 39 which is inner. The inner one is called \"unsurpassed yoga tantra\"9• There are numerous tantras in the unsurpassed yoga tantra section and these, as Gyalwang Je himself clarifies in this text, are divided into three types according to the approach they take to getting to the final understanding of reality. The three are called mother tan­tra, father tantra, and non-dual tantra. Basically speaking, mother tantras are those that emphasis luminosity as a way of arriving at the reality of inseparable appearance-emptiness; father tantras are those that emphasis emptiness as a way of arriving at the reality of inseparable appearance-emptiness; and non-dual tantras are those that, from the outset, follow the path of inseparable appearance­emptiness, emphasizing the non-dual nature of luminosity and emptiness as the means to get to the goal. In the new translation system, there is only one tantra that is non­dual, and that is the Kalachakra tantra. It is seen as the peak of the highest tantras for that reason. Many of Gyalwang Je's explana­tions in this book are given from the perspective of the non-dual ap­proach of Kalachakra. This is yet another interesting and valuable feature of this book; to the best of my knowledge, this is the first text in English that expresses the view of non-dual tantra from the Kagyu or Nyingma perspective. Many Western students of secret mantra as expressed by Ti betan Buddhism often do not realize the differences in the approaches of the tantras. And since most presentations in print are of the deities that belong to either mother or father tantra, it has not been realized that the style of either of these is only one of three styles or even that there is a non-dual style. For example, students who practise the deities of secret mantra (yidams) preferred by the Kagyu tradi­tion, which are mainly mother tantra yidams, often do not realize 9 Skt. anuttarayogatantra"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"40 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU that they are being led along a particular path which has its own distinct features and style and that this path does differ in many ways from the paths of father tantra and non-dual tantra. Similarly for those who practice say Guhyasamaja and Yamantaka, which are popular in the Gelugpa tradition; they are practicing father tantra yidams and the practice has its own particular style. I had the good fortune recently to translate a complete Kalachakra empowerment with Khyentse Rinpoche. As we went through the translation of related practice texts and then the five days of the em­powerment itself, I found myself continually being confronted by the words of Gyalwang Je's text. That is, the non-dual tantra ap­proach which is mentioned many times in here really is an integral part of the view of Kalachakra and it definitely does have a quality to it which differs from that of mother and father tantra. Practising tantrikas should thus find this text of interest: it not only shows you the non-dual approach but in seeing that, it also reflects back and gives you a better sense of how your own practice, of mother or father tantra, works. rdt. � � Stfle ot ��7ett This text deals with \"philosophical\" matters in a very precise way and with brilliant lines of argument but is not put together with the high degree of organization usually found in Tibetan philosophical works. In the Tibetan text, the various oral teachings of the Druk­chen are simply started and ended with the Tibetan equivalent of quotation marks with a couple of words added at the beginning of each so that the reader knows that they have left one teaching and moved onto another. There are none of the usual headings and"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 41 sub-headings which would be found in a text which was presenting and arguing points of the view. I have reflected this style as closely as possible by dividing the English into chapters where each chap­ter is a new teaching and where each chapter simply begins with the same words as in the Tibetan-\"Gyalwang Je said ... \". (Actu­ally, each teaching begins with \"Je said\" but this translates into \"The Lord said\" and the obvious resonance with the Christian genre of literature seemed too overwhelming, so I expanded the Je to its full form Gyalwang Je.) I feel it important to use formatting features of Western texts to aid the presentation of Tibetan texts in translation but not to the extent that it overwhelms the style of the original. Therefore, I have avoided the temptation to come up with nice chapter headings and to put a lot of extra filigree around the simple style of the Tibetan. The original contains no table of contents, summaries, or enumera­tions of teachings; it is just a continuous flow of teachings that are marked off with the above words. However, to make it easier for the reader, I have added a number to each chapter and written a small summary of each chapter and put these into a table of con­tents. Thus the presentation of the text in English reflects closely the style of the original, which is one of highly accurate and involved philos­ophy which is always brought back to an extremely practical sense. And that, after all, is the Kagyu style; they pride themselves on be­ing a practice lineage but at the same time they are not without pro­found scholarship. All in all, the style of presentation of the text is an excellent representation of the approach of the lineage. I think that as you read the text, once you have some understand­ing of the material (which admittedly is difficult and demands a good prior knowledge in many chapters), you will delight in the way that the Gyalwang's precision married to his way of speaking"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"42 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU of the ultimate, takes you to a practical understanding and a feeling that you really could go to those states of mind. In other words, this text has extraordinary blessings attached to it and if you are connected with those blessings, you could obtain a great deal out of it. The first time I sent this to a publisher, it was reviewed by a panel of non-practising Buddhist academics. Apparently they were abso­lutely shocked that anyone could write such a thing as contained in the last paragraph. They wrote vehement criticisms of the book and rejected it in a most heavy-handed manner. That is good. It allows me to point out that purely logical mind, which is where they were coming from, is exactly what this book is not about, even though it uses the process of logical argument to get its message across. One of the key points in the Kagyu tradition is that devo­tion (meaning the special form of devotion to the guru which is not blind or idiot faith) is the way to realization. So, even though an author would normally expunge the previous paragraph in order to get his book published, I have left it there and made this comment. This text is not presenting stuff purely for scholarly exercise. It is also not presenting the established church's view which has been taken up as definitive by so many Western academics. It is present­ing stuff for getting to enlightenment. Getting to enlightenment according to the tradition that gave the teachings recorded in this text is sometimes aided by correct, intellectual understanding but in the end that does not help much. What is important is to get the profound oral instructions of the guru and then, with faith in his wisdom mind, to gather blessings from him and practise. This text reflects exactly that understanding and any reader of it who thinks that the previous paragraph is wrong somehow has missed or will miss the entire meaning of this book!"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 43 �-tpa4e (t) 7� ()He, \"e� 7� ()It-tie 1'ieet.t-The first teaching is the longest teaching in the text and, together with the first few teachings, forms the bulk of the text. These teach­ings set out the view very clearly according to the Kagyu tradition in general and also take up particular issues according to the spe­cific view of the Drukpa Kagyu. These teachings are presented very succinctly. The issues stand out very clearly for anyone well­versed in them but anyone without knowledge of the specifics will not see them or their implications. Therefore, I have written a guide to the first teaching specifically to highlight and clarify the issues and lines of thought involved. The guide follows this intro­duction, before the actual text of Gyalwang Je. You will find small roman numerals marking the sections in the guide; these correlate to the sections of Teaching One marked with the same numbering system. The teachings of Gyalwang Je were heard by his disciple, Sonam Chogdan, who extracted what he thought to be relevant to the subject of the view and put them together in this text called \"Chariot of Establishment\", Treasure Trove of a Mind Absorbed in the Profound Meaning.

Sonam Chogdan took it upon himself to take from the teachings what he saw as being crucial to practitioners in general and to ar­range and write them down. In other words, this text is rather like the genre of Buddhist texts which has become popular in the West today, that is, a book which consists of transcripts of a variety of teachings round a theme or themes by a teacher. This is an interest­ing point because I don't think that there is a Tibetan text of this type which has been presented so far. This text then shows that this style of transcript was done in the Tibetan tradition, too. More than that though, the text is not a highly scholastic presenta­tion of the view that goes on for chapter after chapter, exploring all of the issues in a highly organized and logical way. Rather, it is oral teaching, in chunks, with each chunk addressing some particu­lar issue. Thus again, this is a book on the view but it is presented in a way not really seen up till now. It is a Kagyu teacher of great realization and learning who, from his realization, has presented, using proper reasoning, specific issues of the view according to his own tradition. It has the strong sense of starting from realization and then using reasoning where necessary to inform. This is ex­actly the style of the Kagyus; they are a lineage (Tib. brgyud) where the guru's realization comes out as instructions or commands (Tib. bka') for the practitioner. The instructions do not necessarily come out in a logician's style-and more often than not they don't (for example, see the songs of the great masters of the Kagyu tradition in The Rain of Wisdom). In this case, the instructions come out from realization in a style which is of that freer style but which tends to use very good logic in order to get the point of the view across. Sonam Chogdan makes a good arrangement of Gyalwang Je's vari­ous teachings. First is a long, clear presentation of the view which"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 45 shows how Buddhist teachings arise from the space of reality, then it goes through the Kagyu approach to those teachings starting with sutra and then tantra, and finally shows the differences between the approaches of conventional sutra and of tantra. Note again that the tantra side is never lost or deliberately left out-the Kagyu lineage really is yogic lineage which makes the tantric teachings primary. After the first chapter there is another long chapter in which the dif­ferences of view, vehicle, and tenet for sutra and tantra are shown and again, from the perspective that the tantric approach is the ulti­mate approach. After that comes a wealth of shorter teachings that weave a picture of the view of the tantras, putting the various aspects of the new translation system into place but always coming back to the pinna­cle of the new translation tantras, the non-dual system of the Kalachakra. Along the way there are lots of short but incisive and, ultimately, extremely practical instructions on the various things that a practitioner needs to know about, for example, the samayas and their relationship to the restraints of the lesser yanas. Thus you will find that each teaching is useful but there is also a lot of mean­ing in terms of the arrangement of the material in the chapters. The final chapter is a poetic rendition of the nature of the Buddha's teaching taken across the three vehicles. If I have waxed lyrical here and you tum to these chapters only to think them harsh and unpractical, please consider that this is not a nice book full of nice little teachings for the workaday, Western Buddhist on \"how to work with the emotions\", etcetera, etcetera. It is a text on the \"view\" with no punches pulled. As such it both re­quires and dispenses plenty of intellectual precision. However, again, the style of the text and the obvious brilliance of the teacher behind it, always provide a large door for this intellectual precision not to be a dry philosophical dissertation but a very incisive look"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"46 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU into the things that practitioners need to have clear and straight in the mind. Sometimes you might find the English not euphonious. I have done my best to make it readable but in many places have retained the Tibetan word order and also the long sentences that character­ize Tibetan literature. There is good reason for this. Tibetan texts usually have great meaning not only in the words themselves but in how they are arranged (the syntactic level). I have also deliber­ately used unusual word structures in places in order to get as much of the meaning in the Tibetan text out into the English as pos­sible. Finally, and perhaps most importantly of all, if the text is hard to read in some places it is because the Tibetan is also difficult. It is a text about the view after all and not a simple one; it uses com­plex statements that often depend on the audience having consider­able prior knowledge of the subject. To help understand the text, I have written a narrative to the first chapter which is connected to various places in the text by a roman numbering system. I have also added copious footnotes, and a glossary too. One important point is that this is not the sort of text that you read like a story book. You have to read and re-read it; you will then find that levels of meaning will jump out at you. Also, you will often find something said in other chapters that will elucidate the meaning in the one you are reading. In the end, this is a Kagyu-style text, and the understanding that it points to simply cannot be obtained without connection to the lin­eage. If you really want to know what this text is talking about (for example \"the method of time\" as it is called in one chapter), you will need to do what has been done since time immemorial and go to a Kagyu teacher for the direct, oral instructions about it.

Gyalwang Je starts in the single, all-containing sphere of reality. He points out that all of the Buddha's teachings come out of that sphere, and that therefore all versions of the teachings have the same fundament. The various teachings that appear from all-en­compassing reality might have the same fundament but, of all of them, it is the vajra teachings which have a journey that allows re­connection with reality directly instead of conceptually. Gyalwang Je then outlines the whole path of the vajra vehicle, starting with the ground, continuing with all the key points of the path, and end­ing with the fruition of someone who has overcome all of their obscurations using that path. That fruition is a return to the origi­nal reality that the teachings come from. Thus, he shows that all of existence both enlightened and un-enlightened is contained in the one, all-encompassing sphere of reality10• This is the perspective of the tantras in general and one of the hallmarks of the non-dual tan­tras in particular, both Mahamudra and Maha Ati. 10 Tib. thig le nya gcig.

He says, \"The root in all of the Mahayana vehicles-both the conventional vehicle of the bodhisatvas11 and the non-dual vajra vehicle-whether you look at their textual or ultimate approaches, is one of being seated in the re­ality which is the nature of all dharmas, called \"absolute bodhicitta\" in the conventional Mahayana and great-bliss co-emergent wisdom in the Mahamudra teaching of the vajrayana. Every presentation ever made by any of them has this as its basic approach\". Now, for the path of the vajrayana. First he mentions the type of person who can enter such a path. He says, \"Those people who en­ter the thoroughly realistic path of non-duality through the ap­proach of direct as opposed to conceptual comprehension (in which there is the dualistic differencing of this here and that there) of the 11 Throughout this book and elsewhere, you will find that I always spell bodhisatva and some related terms containing satva with one \"t\". It might come as a surprise but the Tibetans, from the earliest days of translation, have kept two different spellings for satva depending on context. Bodhisatva and Vajrasatva are always spelled with one 't'. Sattva by itself and in some other terms is spelled with a 't'. This is not an accident or spelling mistake. This distinction is seen throughout Tibetan literature from the first introduction of Buddhist teachings into Tibet until the pre­sent. The difference in spelling does have a meaning according to such knowledgeable sources as Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who explained the specifics and affirmed that the spelling with a single 't' is intended and is not carelessness or a mistake. For those interested in pursuing the matter, even a cursory examination of Tibetan texts will show that bodhisatva and vajrasatva are always spelled with one 't' and not two. It seems that Western scholars in recent centuries, not having read a large swath of Tibetan literature, have just assumed that the spelling was always with two 't's and this habit has become entrenched amongst non­Tibetans dealing with Tibetan Buddhism. However, Tibetan literature it­self has always and does make the distinction mentioned above. This is something that translators should pay attention to; the mistake that we have engendered needs to be corrected."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO THE MEANING OF TEACHING ONE 51 nature of all dharmas are the very fortunate ones of great merit who connect with reality through the highest path, the path of the vajra vehicle, as opposed to the ones of lesser merit and fortune who connect with reality and make their way to it through the con­ventional understandings of the lower vehicles.\" iv Now he sets out the preliminaries that such a person must go through in order to access the vajra path. The necessary preliminar­ies are twofold. He says,\" First, a person has to take the bodhisatva vows; that brings them into the Mahayana family and defines them as a member of that family. Then a person must be entered into a mal)c;lala of the vajra vehicle. Just as taking the bodhisatva vows defines a person as a member of the Mahayana family, so being en­tered into a mal)c;lala of the vajra vehicle determines the person as a member of the vajra group. Members of the conventional Mahaya­na vehicle are characterized as beings whose realization of superfactual bodhicitta is conceptual and hence has the quality of dealing in conceptual \"pieces\" and of having 'this' and 'that' that is, duality, in all of its perceptions. Members of the vajra vehicle on the other hand are characterized as have the direct experience of the reality of superfactual bodhicitta. v Once a person has been entered into a vajra mal)c;lala, they have to start upon the path. First the author mentions the type of path. He says, \"In the Mahamudra system, Vajradhara is the primordial principle. A Mahamudra practitioner thus becomes a person fol­lowing that kind of system. The teachings of the system are the ex­traordinarily profound teachings of the fruitional path of actualiz­ing enlightened body, speech, and mind here and now.\" vi Practically speaking, that kind of path has two parts. At the very outset, one has to have the introduction to the nature of mind. This is an indispensable prerequisite for actually practising the path. It is given by the guru and is very private. \"The method of time\" is a"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"52 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU key phrase in the terminology connected with the introduction to the nature of mind. It indicates the means by which the beginning student is introduced to their own nature of mind12• vii Next, the practitioner, having been introduced to the nature of their own mind, must now practise and develop their realization right to the end of the path. The essence of the practice is not the produc­tion of deities or higher perceptions but to cut directly to the reality which each person has within and which has been covered over till now with various types of dualistic clinging and grasping. Clear­ing out all the means by which conceptualization creates the differ­ence of a this and a that is the single point which epitomizes the Buddha's teaching. viii Now he gives the fruition of the path, which is the time when the practitioner returns completely to the reality of their original ground. In the vajra vehicle, like the lesser vehicles, the practitioner overcomes all forms of ignorant conceptuality that create the grasp­ed difference of this and that. By doing so the phenomena pro­duced by dualistic grasping are stopped and the conventional mindstream is eliminated. The practitioner opens up his inherent wisdom and the complete display of wisdom appearances with it. The experience of these pure appearances is the experience of bliss. Hence the practitioner returns to a wisdom which is a wisdom of co-emergent bliss-emptiness. This is the original ground of the practitioner-the nature of all dharmas-that was at the root of all vehicles but now the practitio­ner has returned to it in such a way that the movement from that reality into dualistic confusion will not happen again. The person is now a fully awakened buddha. 12 Tib. dus thabs. The term has been mistakenly translated for some time now; often as \"timely method\"."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"ix GUIDE TO THE MEANING OF TEACHING ONE 53 Gyalwang Je started by presenting all vehicles of Buddhist practice as part of the one, encompassing sphere of reality. In particular, he showed the ground, path, and fruition of the vajra vehicle. The Buddhist teachings emerge from the encompassing sphere of reality through the kindness of a buddha. The teachings stay and, after a period of time, degrade and disappear. This cycle repeats itself again and again. In our world, four buddhas have appeared so far and re-revealed the teachings. The last was the exceptional buddha called Shakyamuni, \"the Sage of the Shakya Clan\". He was excep­tional because most buddhas teach only the common or conven­tional or exoteric teachings called sutra but he also taught the entire uncommon or non-conventional or esoteric teachings called tantra. When Shakyamuni Buddha presented these teachings he did so on four, major occasions. Each occasion was a universe-shattering event because on each occasion, he presented a new body of teach­ing concerning reality that had been lost from or not heard of in this and other worlds previously. These major events of setting out the precious path to liberation in worlds where were they were un­known were called \"turning the wheel of dharma\". There are good reasons for this apparently odd terminology all of which are related to the thought of the Ancient Indian culture of the time. The main thing for a modem-day reader to understand is that when you see the words \"turned the wheel\" or \"turning of the wheel\" it does not mean simply that the Buddha taught something but signifies an event of cosmic proportions in which a complete set of teachings concerning the path to reality is revealed in a place where such teachings have been lost or never heard. Many will know that Shakyamuni Buddha presented the teachings in three turnings of the wheel. These very well known three turn­ings of the dharma wheel were the three major occasions on which the Buddha showed the various levels of the common or conven­tional teaching. It is regarded in the tantras that the presentation of"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"54 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU the uncommon teaching, the tantric teachings, was a fourth, major occasion, and is referred to throughout the tradition as the fourth turning of the wheel of dharma. Historically, practitioners who accept and practise the teachings only of the first turning of wheel have denied that the later turnings of the wheel exist. The practitioners who accept and practise the teachings of the second and or third turning of the wheel usually accept the fourth turning, whether they practise it personally or not. Gyalwang Je's assessment of the turnings of the wheel of dharma was not written from the perspective of the first type of person; it was written from the perspective of the second type of person in general and in particular from the perspective of a person who ac­cepts and practises the teachings of all four turnings of the wheel. Thus, his arguments never descend to whether the later turnings of the wheel are valid or not which would be the perspective of the first person. Rather, they come from the perspective that all four turnings are valid but question what kind of meaning they have, whether they are provisional or definitive. The issue of the meaning of any given turning is a very big subject in Buddhism altogether for, if one wants to understand the view that the Buddha was presenting, one has to be certain about the intended meaning of the teachings that he gave. Thus the subject of how the teachings contained in the various, four turnings of the wheel should be taken has historically been a big issue. In Tibet, it became a very hot topic. There was no disagreement over the meaning of the first turning of the wheel; all schools accept that it was provisional, not definitive. However, there were major points of disagreement over how the second and third turnings should be taken. The disagreements became so intense that they ended up causing warfare between monasteries of opposing views, sad to say. If there were no disagreement over how the second and third turnings should be taken, that is, what their meaning was within"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO THE MEANING OF TEACHING ONE the larger scope of the Buddha's teaching then significant parts of this book would not be written or would be written differently. The issue is that central. 55 At any rate, it is because of this disagreement that the next portion of the text takes the form it does. Gyalwang Je starts out the first sentence of this section by tying it to the previous introduction of a vajra vehicle that is the ultimate representation of the single, encompassing sphere of reality. Now, how should the view of that vehicle be understood? A buddha's teachings emerge from the sphere of reality for the sake of the sentient beings who have become ignorant of that reality and who are, therefore, in an entirely unsatisfactory mode of existence. A buddha could teach just one teaching hoping that all could un­derstand it or a buddha could give the teaching in various levels where the levels are presented according to the various capabilities of the beings who are to benefit from it. In Tibetan Buddhist thou­ght, it is universally agreed that Shakyamuni Buddha taught at var­ious levels. It is universally accepted that the first turning of the wheel was a lesser level of teaching aimed in two ways. The first point of the teaching was to inform beings that the nature of their situation was unsatisfactory and it was delivered with a consider­able push that sentient beings should liberate themselves from that situation. The second point was a complete teaching on how to gain an individual liberation that would at least get oneself out of unsatisfactoriness and into a satisfactory situation. Neither of these teachings is a definitive teaching, they are informative at the con­ventional level and point the way out but they do not reveal the depths of reality nor do they reveal methods that lead to full real­ization of those depths. For that reason, these teachings are called \"provisional in meaning\". The original Sanskrit term for that, 'ney­artha' means \"a meaning that is not the actual thing that is being addressed but which serves to lead one along to the actual mean-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"56 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU ing\". The Tibetan term 'drang don' means \"a meaning that serves to draw one along so that one will arrive at the actual meaning later\". Everyone in Tibetan Buddhism agrees that the teachings of the first turning of the wheel of dharma are provisional. The second turning of the wheel presented the teachings from a much vaster and also much more profound level. They were vaster because the liberation was not taught for oneself alone as in the pre­vious set of teachings but was taught for the sake of every, single sentient being. In other words, in the first set of teachings one would aspire to and attain liberation solely for oneself. In the sec­ond level of the teachings one would aspire to becoming a buddha in order to extricate oneself from unsatisfactoriness but equally so that one would have the means and intent to extract all other sen­tient beings from their unsatisfactoriness, too. These teachings were more profound because the reality talked about in that turn­ing was a much deeper presentation of reality than in the first turn­ing. The hallmark of the approach to reality in this teaching is that of \"characteristics\" and \"characteristic-less-ness\". Reality was taug­ht as \"characteristic-less-ness\", that is, an absence of the conceptual characteristics that are the stuff of a dualistic mind. The path itself was taught in terms of these conceptual characteristics and how to abandon them using logical mind. The third turning of the wheel presented the teachings from the same vast and profound approach as the second turning. How­ever, there was an emphasis on the innate portion of the mind that is the possibility of buddhahood and on approaches to reality based on that. In these approaches logical analysis is not used to deny the mistakes of conceptual mind but one takes the possibility of buddhahood as a fact to be brought forth. Thus there is a shift in approach."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO THE MEANING OF TEACHING ONE 57 The Tibetans have a huge disagreement over whether the second turning or third turning presents the definitive meaning, the actual meaning that the Buddha intended. The disagreement falls along these lines: the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions which were yogic traditions at root say that the third turning of the wheel is more de­finitive than the second. This presentation fits well with their un­derstanding of the tantric teachings of the fourth turning. For them, the Buddha taught the four turnings of the wheel in a progression of increasing subtlety. That is the view presented by Gyalwang Je and all of the other Kagyu hierarchs. It is also the view of the Nyingma school in general. The Sakya tradition of Tibet is also a yogic tradition, however, one of their early, great masters (Sakya Pal).c;iita) was of the opinion that direct yogic perception could not happen without reasoning as an antecedent. Thus, some Sakya masters have followed the approach of the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions just presented others, though, have put the second turn­ing as higher than the third turning. Then, there is the most recent of the four main Tibetan traditions of Buddhism, the Gelugpa tradi­tion. Following the presentations of their founder, Je Tsongkhapa, they accept that the second turning of the wheel is definitive. They also say that some parts of the third turning are definitive and some provisional in meaning. However, their emphasis is on the ap­proach of the second turning of the wheel in which logic is used to get at reality. The first through third turnings of the wheel are the conventional or common teachings of the Buddha. The fourth turning is the un­common teachings called the tantric teachings. The difference be­tween the common and uncommon teachings can be summed up in several ways but one that suits here is that the common teachings are causal and the uncommon ones are fruitional. The meaning is this: the common vehicles' teachings take the approach that one practises now to create the causes for a future result; the uncom­mon vehicle takes the approach that one practises the result now,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"58 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU one actually embodies the fruition here and now. Most people would agree on the surface of it that the fruitional approach some­how seems special compare to the others and that is certainly the view that is adopted within Tibetan Buddhism. In the first turning of the wheel, the reality that was spoken of was only a partial presentation as mentioned earlier. The reality spoken of in the remaining three vehicles is the same reality. However, there are degrees of how explicitly that reality is presented. Gyal­wang Je makes this point over and again. The Kagyu schools take the approach that the presentation of real­ity through the second, third, and fourth turnings of the wheel is increasingly subtle, even if the reality being described is the same. The Gelugpa tradition on the other hand has a very different ap­proach. They insist that the presentation in the second turning is a pivotal presentation and they tend to let that wash over the later presentations, something which the Kagyus could never accept. You will see Gyalwang Je address this issue in the second chapter. One of the problems here is the old saw: can you really get to real­ity, which is a non-dualistic situation, using dualistic, logical mind? The second turning says that you can and again, the Gelugpa tradi­tion has made that into a prime approach. The Nyingmas and Ka­gyus however, say that you can't really, that the only way to get to non-dual reality is to go directly to it. The teachings of the third turning contain a thread that presents the fundamental knowing quality of mind without the dualistic paraphernalia: if one could get into that, one would have the mind of reality without any further ado. These teachings present a path for doing that but the meaning is a little hidden and they still rely on a conventional approach. The tantric teachings of the fourth turning take it a step further: using non-conventional terminology and a practical approach that leaves"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO THE MEANING OF TEACHING ONE 59 rational examination behind, they explicitly show how to get to that fundamental knowing quality in immediate and direct perception. For the Kagyus, the third turning is a step higher than the second turning. For them, the third turning contains the more subtle ap­proach of the tantras, even if it is hidden within conventional termi­nology. The arguments about these things have raged on and on for centu­ries now. To understand them fully requires a considerable amou­nt of listening to the teachings of the various traditions involved. Still, the brief presentation made above, should help to clarify what is happening in this portion of the text. x In Indian Buddhism, before the dharma arrived in Tibet, there was a first level bodhisatva called Nagarjuna who established very clearly the approach to reality embodied in the second turning of the wheel. There was also a third level bodhisatva called Asa:ti.ga who clarified many of the meanings of the third turning of the wheel. In the debates over which of the second and third turnings are definitive, some have, essentially speaking, put Nagarjuna's system as definitive. Others, including the Kagyus, take the inner­most part of Asailga's presentation and make that definitive. How­ever, in fact, it is not that one was right and the other was wrong. As Gyalwang Je points out, both of them and all of their followers, including the really great masters who stood out in Indian Bud­dhism (The six ornaments and two supreme ones) were beings who had correctly assessed and come to direct perception of reality. Thus, even though they presented the view of reality in differing ways, the differing presentations cannot be taken as signs of a dif­fering reality. They all saw the same thing, they just wrote about it taking different approaches. This fits with one of the four \"great­nesses\" of the Kadampa teachings, which are so much part of the Gelugpa teachings. In other words, Gyalwang Je is having a very"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"60 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU clever dig at the Gelugpa followers here. The Gelugpa followers would like to say that Nagarjuna really has the view. However, Gyalwang Je has just pointed out that Nagarjuna and Asanga both have it and that right there fits with the Kadampa way of teaching which the Gelugpa tradition is founded upon. Specifically, Nagarjuna championed the use of logic and Asailga championed the yogic approach of contacting the inner, subtle mind of enlightenment. The Kagyus do not disagree with the for­mer; it is a valid approach. However, they find the latter one to be more direct. Moreover, the latter approach, as said before, fits with the tantric approach which is the actual practice of the Kagyus. At any rate, Gyalwang Je says, in cases where there is a disagree­ment, the person we have to turn to as the final arbiter is the Bud­dha because he is the one who is the final point of validity in our Buddhist system. What does the Buddha say? Well, the Buddha did make prophecies about each of these two bodhisatvas that were recorded in the Buddhist scriptures. Furthermore, the Buddha gives a clear mention of what their particular roles would be. Gyal­wang Je concludes that, according to the Buddha, Nagarjuna will be the one who will determine the view and Asanga will be the one who will determine the issue of which teaching is provisional and which definitive. Gyalwang Je then shows how, according to the Kagyu School, the view was determined by Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna wrote many texts and later tradition has grouped them together into collections that fit with the four turnings of the wheel. There are four collections, each one relating to one of the four turnings. Each collection con­tains several texts and Gyalwang Je lists the names of each of the four texts that epitomize each collection. For example, the collec­tion of stories contains The Friendly Letter to A King and others; the collection of reasonings contains the Root Prajfiii, and others; etc."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO THE MEANING OF TEACHING ONE 61 For the Kagyus, the four turnings of the wheel correspond to a se­quence of increasingly subtle presentation of the Buddhist view, as has been mentioned. The four collections of Nagarjuna' s texts can be put into an order that corresponds to that exactly. This, for them is proof that Nagarjuna was not merely a champion of the view of the second turning. Rather, they see his famous works on the logi­cal approach to reality as the second of four successively profound levels of teaching that correspond to the four turnings of the wheel, and not the highest one of all. Is there anyone else whose teachings fit with this kind of approach? Well yes! The great yogin Milarepa, one of the earliest and greatest forefathers of the Kagyu school, and accepted by all Tibetans as a master who went to the final attainment, gave many teachings and the sequence of four, increasingly subtle levels of presentation of reality can be seen in his works in a way that corresponds exactly with the sequence found in Nagarjuna's works (and remember that they fit with the sequence of the turnings of the wheels of dharma by the Buddha himself). The quotes from Milarepa' s teachings come from two different songs. The presentation in these songs of the sequence of the view can be the subject of a whole book and I do not wish to present it here (it is in another book, called The Other Emptiness that should come out shortly). Not only Milarepa, but his disciple, the great Gampopa, also pre­sented this same progression of four steps that correspond to the Buddha's turning of four wheels. This can be clearly seen in Gampopa' s famous four lines that sum up the whole of the dharma and which are called \"The Four Dharmas of Gampopa\". Gyalwang Je gives a brief assessment of how these four present the view in the same four steps."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"62 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU And not only that but all of the great forefathers of the Kagyu sys­tem presented this same sequence of the view. He concludes that anyone who wants to proclaim that they are presenting the view of the Kagyu authentically would have to present it in just this se­quence of four, increasingly subtle steps that correspond to the four turnings of the wheel that were taught by the Buddha, just as Mila­repa, and the others, the forefathers of the Kagyu lineage have done. The Kagyu approach to the Buddha's teaching was knocked down repeatedly by the established church of Tibet but it is the teaching of the whole Kagyu tradition and is not so easy to negate, when you really get down to it. It has been pointed out in the West in recent years that, for the first few decades of the transmission of Tibetan Buddhist teachings to the West, only the view of the Gelug­pa church was known. Because of this, it was assumed by many for a long time that the presentation that comes from them is the only presentation of the dharma in Tibet. However, in terms of the view, that is not the case. There are profound disagreements over how the view is to be seen. The Kagyus and Nyingma's have a view which is expressed very differently from the Gelugpa church; this book helps considerably to present the core of that view. Gyalwang Je continues with a presentation of how the Kagyu tradi­tion determines the four truths. As mentioned before, the way of doing this is to classify each of the turnings or teachings within them as being either provisional or definitive. The Kagyu system, when taking account of all four turnings of the wheel presents a sequence in which there are two provisional level and two definite level turnings of the wheel. The first two turnings are provisional level and the last two definitive, just as the author lays out. More­over, the first two are provisional of the provisional and definitive of the provisional and the latter two are provisional of the definitive and definitive of the definitive. In essence, it is done this way be-"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO THE MEANING OF TEACHING ONE 63 cause, although the second turning of the wheel is a perfect presen­tation of reality from a logical approach, logical approaches are not as final as non-logical, direct perception approaches. Since the last two wheels embody the non-logical, direct perception approach, they are stated to be definitive in distinction to the first two which are provisional. Note that this is not the only way to do it. In the Kagyu school, if you were not looking at the four turnings but only the three turn­ings, you would make the first as provisional, the second as provi­sional of definitive and the third as definitive of definitive; Jamgon Kongtrullays out this approach in his Treasury which is an Encyclo­pcrdia of Knowledge. This approach does not contradict the approach given here at all; it is a subset of it. Moreover, relative to the first turning, the second turning is defini­tive, and relative to the third turning, it is provisional. Some soph­ist might try to argue that it can't be both (probably because of attempting to insist that the second turning has to be definitive be­cause that is what he has been told and he has never really stopped to think it through himself). But that is just hard-headedness; as Gyalwang Je says, one is speaking about inter-relationships here, not fixed facts. You might wonder why anyone would have to make this point. It is because people in Tibet did fall into the trap of believing what they were told and then, when confronted with another possibility, instead of applying dear-thinking to the mat­ter-as the Buddha himself said should be done (see the chapter on the four reliances p. 267)-they would use every logical means pos­sible to maintain their way of assertion. This is exactly the problem that led to the acrimony between the Established Church and other schools in Tibet. One of my teachers, a Kagyu lama who was sent to study at Sera when he was young and who thus became a Gelug­pa lama, told me once that the best way to understand your own view was to study the view of the \"far mountain\" that is, the view"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"64 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU of your opponents. Interestingly, if you really take this to heart, there is the possibility that you might discover a new set of mean­ings in your own view that allowed the possibility of the other view, too. Either that or you might find that your attachment to your own view was a problem. This should not be taken to mean that the understanding of the Prajfiaparamita, which is the epitome of the teaching of the view of the second turning of the wheel, is being stated as incorrect. To the contrary, this presentation, within itself, is accepted as being the highest possible presentation of reality possible using the methods involved (of logical analysis). The Kagyus are not arguing that there is something wrong with Nagarjuna' s presentation of reality in texts like the Root Prajfia or in the Buddha's Prajfiaparamita su­tras. Rather, they are saying that the meaning there is the very meaning pointed to by the third and fourth turnings, it is just that the latter two have methods which are more refined for getting at the same truth. This is a very important point for Western people. We, with our highly trained rational minds find it very easy to resonate with style of the teachings of the second turning and therefore, very easy to believe that this is it! It is a teaching in the Kagyu lineage that there can be a great danger in over-training yourself in logical methods. If you spend years and years at it-as we have to do first when we are young by law in the West and then tend to continue on with-you develop such a strong habit of intellect that you can never break through it, into the wisdom mind that the tantric teach­ings show explicitly as the inner reality of a buddha. Having made his presentation of how the four vehicles are pre­sented in terms of provisional and definitive meaning, the author goes on to point out that there is another way of categorizing the four vehicles, and that is one that corresponds to the progression of"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO THE MEANING OF TEACHING ONE 65 the sharpness of faculties of the practitioner. Note that sharpness of faculty here does not refer to the sharpness of intellect but refers overall to a being's spiritual development and the capability that they have because of it. If it were purely intellect that were the measure, you would have to make the second turning into the pen­ultimate one because that is the turning in which hyper-sharp intel­lect is the most important tool. This seems to be what happened in the days of Tsongkhapa and his followers. So, we arrive at the point where it is clear that there is a difference between the approach of the general Mahayana (the paramita Mahayana system) which does not include the tantric vehicle and the tantric vehicle itself. Gyalwang Je goes on for the rest of the chapter to make various distinctions between the general Maha­yana and the uncommon Mahayana, also known as the Vajrayana. It is possible to differentiate between the common and uncommon vehicles by looking at their attributes. This has been done many times over the centuries by various great masters. A later chapter looks at just these kinds of distinctions. Here, Gyalwang Je relies on a quote from The Lamp of the Three Modes to pick out several dif­ferences between the styles of the practitioner of each vehicle. The basic point is that the uncommon vehicle does not have a more pro­found view (though the expressions of it might be more direct and effective) but does have especially refined methods compared with the common vehicle. Still, Gyalwang Je points out, those are the observable features of an underlying difference but are not the root of the difference itself. What is the very root of the difference? I have already mentioned it many times earlier: it is the difference in how the view is actualized in the practitioner's mind. Is it actualized via a very sharp logical process in which mistaken items are eliminated so that in the end reality might come forth or is it a direct approach that accepts the existence of that reality and steps into it without logical analysis?"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"66 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU The former is the approach of the Prajftaparamita of the second turning of the wheel. The latter is the approach of the tantras of the fourth turning of the wheel. There are specific words for these two approaches in logic. The first is called a mam.dpyod; a kind of analysis in which you look at the surface attributes and, using logic, tum away all appearances that are incorrect. In the end, you arrive at a lack of deluded appear­ances and that \"lack\" or emptiness of the deluded appearances is said to be their reality. The second is called a yongs.dpyod; a kind of analysis in which you do not negate what is wrong in order to be left with what is right but in which you embrace what is correct to begin with. In the former, analysis (dpyod) means logical analysis, in the latter dpyod does not mean logical analysis but \"direct in­sight\". These terms have other connotations, too. When you talk about mam.pa, the attributes of the first kind of analysis, it means you have to examine each thing, one by one by one. For example, in the Prajftaparamita, it says \"no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue ... \" and on and on; every superfice has to be examined logically one at a time. This is the nature of logical, dualistic mind; it can only do one thing at time. When you talk about yongs.su, the \"all-inclusive, universal\" quality of the second analysis, you are talking about in­sight that occurs without the use of rational analysis. It is talking about non-dualistic, wisdom mind that takes in the whole situation at once and sees it for what it is. In the end, the reality that is ar­rived at by each of these methods is not different, therefore it is not the case that the rational analysis of the second turning is being put down as a lesser view by the Kagyus. However, the effectiveness of the approaches that lead to that view is markedly different and the Kagyus are setting that up as a basis for distinguishing the un­common vehicle as special compared to the common vehicle."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO THE MEANING OF TEACHING ONE 67 Then there is another way to see the difference between the approaches of the common and uncommon vehicles. The Buddha taught the three prajftas as a way of progressing on the path. First one has to hear, then one has to contemplate what one has heard and make proper sense of it-get it straight in mind, then finally one has to cultivate it (meditate on it) in order to make it part of one's being. The common vehicle's approach to that is an outer approach, it is hallmarked by conceptuality and approaches consis­tent with conceptual effort. The uncommon vehicle's approach to that is hallmarked by non-conceptuality and approaches consistent with no conceptual effort. Gyalwang Je gives an extensive break­down of the three approaches in the two systems. With the basic view of the Kagyu set out in this chapter, the next chapter goes on to make clearer distinctions between the views and approaches of the siitra and tantra traditions."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"'�ot�\" 7� 7�UWe olet 'i1tUtd �\"\" tieP�� 7� ol de SeetJMt �, 7��fle � � «J4t 1fl�"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Namo Shri Gurave, Namo Mahamudraya, Namo Vajrayogin113• Homage to the excellent and holy, glorious guru who is the perva­sive lord of all secrets and the embodiment of supreme bliss, and to Venerable Jetsun Vajrayoginl of stainless lotus.

In relation to thaeiii, the Dharma King, the Buddha Bhagavat gave his commands in three stages of turning the wheel of dharma. The first turning was provisional in meaning; this has been attested to by the learned and accomplished ones of both India and Tibet. Which of the second and third was provisional and which defini­tive has become a debate these days, however, the following can be said. Nagarjuna-and-successors and Asailga-and-brother are re­nowned as the two founders of mainstream tradition and what they accepted and also what others have accepted following on from them are one and the same in that they both arrive at and set­tle upon suchness16• By the same logic, the ones renowned as The Six Ornaments and Two Supreme Ones also took positions that ap­peared to be different and contradictory but in fact within reality they had mastered the non-contradictory key point. Thus, there is the greatness of realizing that all the teachings are non-contradic­tory. 16 Tib. gzhol zhing 'bab pa: is a stock phrase for writers discussing the view. It means that one uses some means to arrive at a correct understand­ing of the view (logic gets at emptiness in the common vehicle, direct per­ception gets at unified appearance-emptiness in the uncommon vehicle) then, having determined it, settles into that reality in meditation according to that system."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"TEACHING ONE 75 On occasions where there appears to be disagreement, the con­queror himself is to be made the valid authority17• In the scriptures of the Bhagavat, it says, and, \"In the south, in the country of Veta A bhikshu renowned as very glorious, Called by the name \"Naga\" Destroyer of the sides of existence and non-existence ... \" \"A bhikshu who will be called \"Asari.ga\" Expert in the meaning of the shastras Will thoroughly distinguish many aspects Of provisional and definitive meaning in the Sutra sec­tion.\" From this, we are to understand that the person to determine the view is Nagarjuna and the person to distinguish between provisional and definitive meanings is Asari.ga, as prophesied. All of Nagarjuna's teaching is collated into four collections: stories; reasonings; praises; and suchness. The collections are considered to be commentaries on the intent in a progression whose sequence corresponds to the sequence of the three wheels followed by the fourth, secret mantra. Thus, Letter to a Friend, and so on are associ­ated with the first turning; Root Prajfiii, and so on with the second turning; In Praise of the Expanse of Dharmas, and so on with the third turning; and The Four Mudriis, The Five Stages, and so on with the ultimate one. The same progression that appears in that style of commentary ap­pears in the teachings of the Great Jetsun Mila. He says, 17 Skt. pramar)a, Tib. tsad rna: The Buddha is the one who has to be set up as the final authority in the sense that he is the one who has to be seen as having full and undistorted cognition of the matter."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"76 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU \"Complying with the appearances of you18 Of lesser minds, the All-knowing Buddha said, \"Everything exists\".\" and with that, the statements \"unsatisfactoriness exists\", \"source exists\"19 effectively appear so the meaning of the four truths of the first command is present. Then he says, \"From the standpoint of the absolute truth, Let alone obstructors there are not even buddhas ... \" which means the lack-of-characteristics of the middle turning. Then he says, \"The skilled ones who realize it to be so, Do not see consciousness, see wisdom; Do not see sentient beings, see buddhas; Do not see dharrnins, see dharmata ... \" 18 Milarepa was speaking with a group of very intelligent Q.akinis and at one point said this to them. There is a great meaning in his words. Even though the Q.akinis are very smart, their minds are still lesser minds be­cause they do not see reality. Like all the other deluded sentient beings, they see solidified appearances. The Buddha started his teaching by speak­ing to beings at their own level and therefore spoke directly in his first set of teachings of \"existence\" and \"non-existence\", meaning solidified exis­tence and non-existence. 19 This a play on the Buddha's words that is not so evident in the English. In the quote, he says \"everything exists\" which is one of Buddha's many statements from and characteristic of the first turning. The teaching given when the Buddha first turned the wheel at Sarnath was the teaching of the Four Noble Truths. In that teaching he said various things about each of the four truths, starting out in each case by saying that there is such a thing as that truth, that is, there is the truth of unsatisfactoriness (it exists), and so on. Thus Milarepa' s statement correlates with this first level of understanding given in the Buddha's first turning of the wheel of dharma, that things do exist."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"TEACHING ONE which means the complete ascertainment of the absolute dharma turning. And then he says, \"There is not self and other knowing; Everything is a vast unification ... \" which, showing all dharmas as the play of non-dual method and prajfta, is an exact match with the commentaries on the intent of secret mantra vajrayana. 77 Likewise, Lord Dvagpo Rinpoche's 'Four Dharmas' also follow the same progression. The first command, the dharma wheel of the four truths, concurs with the step, \"mind follows the dharma\". It is-from the perspective that unsatisfactoriness is to be known, the source is to be abandoned, the path is to be applied to one's mind, and the fruit is to be actualized-that cyclic existence is to be re­nounced, emancipation is to be sought after, and the path of com­plete peace is to be entered. The middle command, the dharma wheel of lack of characteristics concurs with\" dharma turns to the path\" in that both the side to be abandoned, total affliction, and the side of the antidote, complete purification20 are understood to be without birth by nature and be superficies characterized as cause and effect, dependent-related arisings, and are understood as such without mixing up the two modes. The final command, the dhar­ma wheel of complete ascertainment of the superior meanini1 con 20 When the Buddha laid out the Four Noble Truths, he divided them into two groups of two. The first two, unsatisfactoriness and its cause, he called 'total affliction' (Tib. kun nas nyon mongs pa) which really means 'nothing but affliction'. The second two, cessation and its path, he called 'complete purification' (Tib. mam par byang ba). These two terms thus show the two sides of the situation, SaJ11Sara and nirvfu:la as being only affliction and the purification of that affliction respectively.

Secret mantra vajrayana concurs with \"confusion dawns as wisdom\" in that, by apparent existence co-emerging as great bliss without outflows, the play of the three kayas, its transformations into confusion-passion and so forth-are not approached as something to be abandoned but are allowed to be complete in their essence which is svabhavikakaya and great wisdom.

Most translations give \"the path will clarify confusion\" but no Kagyu text and no Kagyu guru or scholar that I have ever met says that it should be understood that way. Everyone and every text agrees that it is that \"the path's confusion will be clarified\". The path's confusion, as all Kagyu teachers put it, means the confusion at the time of the path. The reason for it being this way is that the definition of path being used here is one that has not been well understood in the West as yet. The path as usually defined in the tantras means ''having fallen into obscuration regarding the ground, and hence being on the path\". Given this, the currently popular translation is quite bizarre because it really means \"may the situation of having fallen into confusion dispel confu­sion\"! May this mis-translation quickly be remedied. The third dharma of Gampopa should be: \"Grant your blessings that the path's confusion be dispelled\"."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"TEACHING ONE 79 Further to that, each of the four can be both provisional and defi­nitive. This is not contradictory. Just as a woman is a daughter rel­ative to her mother and a mother relative to her daughter so each one can be provisional meaning as the first member of a pair and definitive meaning as the second member of the pair. The first command, the dharma wheel of the four truths, is the provisional meaning of the provisional meaning because it principally teaches the way things appear in relative truth. The middle one, the dhar­ma wheel of the lack of characteristics, is the definitive meaning of the provisional meaning because it principally teaches the nature of relative truth that is, the way things are. The final one, the dharma wheel of complete ascertainment of the superior meaning, is the provisional meaning of definitive meaning because it teaches by thoroughly distinguishing between the two sides, consciousness and wisdom. The ultimate intent, mantra, is the definitive meaning of definitive meaning because it is the one that teaches non-dual wisdom's suchness in direct perception. In addition, there is also a presentation in which the four are differ­entiated according to sharpness of faculty. The first three corre­spond to 'least, middling, and best' and the fourth to 'very best'. When the 'very best one' has the same four-fold scheme applied to it, the four tantra classes of mantra result. This is seen from the statement, \"From the standpoint of sharp faculties, Mantra vehicle is especially distinguished23\" where sharp means 'best' and four paired assessments-'best of the best' and so on-are then made. 23 The Treasury which is an Encyclopcedia of Knowledge gives a more full quote and indicates that it is from the text, Lamp of the Three Modes: \"Although they are the same meaning, in terms of non-mistake­n-ness, having many methods and being without difficulty, and sharp faculties, the mantra vehicle is special.\""},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"80 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU A difference between paramita and mantra appears at that point. Overall, paramita and mantra vehicles are distinguished in method compared to the Lesser Vehicle thus, within the method vehicle, they are equally the Great Vehicle. However, there is a great differ­ence in their followers' degree of skill in that method. Some follow­ers are un-deluded in that they are highly skilled in the ways of the profound and vast; have more method due having more doors for entering those to be tamed; and proceed without hardship due to not abandoning desirables and making bliss into the path. Their approach is not amenable to all and will only be understood only by a fortunate few, therefore, these followers are set apart as having \"sharp faculties\". Those were the features that illustrate the difference between paramita and mantra. However, the root of the difference is having the aspect of stoppage by attribute analysis versus having the as­pect of accomplishment by overall analysis24 that is, being a fol­lower who cuts things off via something to be abandoned and an antidote versus one who proceeds via the non-duality of something to be abandoned and an antidote. The first one uses syllogistic rea­soning to negate every conceptually-labelled named thing-self, truth, birth, thing, characteristic, nature, elaboration, etcetera-then teaches via non-self, not truly established, non-birth, essence-less­ness, characteristic-less-ness, nature-less-ness, freedom from every 24 The two Tib. terms mam.dpyad and yongs.dpyod are used to highlight the crucial difference between the approach taken by non-tantric and tan­tric vehicles in determining the view. A mam dpyad is an assessment done using rational mind; it examines the (mam pa) individual, surface attributes of something to come to a rational understanding of what the thing is. A yongs dpyod is an assessment done using non-rational mind to discover the (ngo bo) actual thing itself; as such it takes in the whole thing rather than examining its superficies. Another way to translate them might be \"individual, logical analysis\" and \"overall non-logical compre­hension\"."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"TEACHING ONE 81 elaboration, etcetera. The second one uses skill in method regard­ing those dharmas considered by the former to be something to be abandoned-the self that pervades the animate and inanimate, join­ing the two truths in non-duality, co-emergent birth, the essentiality of all dharmas, characteristics universally complete, manifested na­ture, sarpsara and nirvfu).a non-dual, all superficies, etcetera-and teaches thing-ness which is to be established via an awareness which overall knows the nature. We can go further. The view is determined first. However, at the time of cutting the exaggeration laid over what is, there is the dif­ference between 'looking outward' and 'looking inward' as follows. When hearing is made principal, there is the distinction 'in reliance on scripture and reasoning, exaggeration is cut externally' versus 'in reliance on upadeSha exaggeration is cut internally'. When con­templation is made principal, there is the distinction 'individually discriminating prajfia' versus 'individual self-knowing wisdom'. When meditation is made principal, there is the distinction 'pa.IJ.Q.i­ta's analytical meditation' versus 'kusulu's resting meditation'. As for cutting exaggeration externally, Glorious Dharmaklrti said, \"Without refuting this the objecfS, To abandon that is not possible ... \" 25 \"This the object\" is correct. This verse follows on from a preceding verse in the original which much be examined in order to understand the cur­rently quoted verse. Since the currently quoted verse is usually presented without its predecessor, the verse is often mis-translated. The \"this\" refers to something mentioned in preceding verses of the original. What it is is clear from the accompanying commentary by the Drukchen which says that it is \"the object which is the object causing the arising of this passion, aggression, and so on\". The subsequent 'that' refers to grasping at truth in the objects. Note the difference between the pat)Q.ita and kusulu styles of explaining this verse."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"82 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU Here is what I think his intent was26• \"The object that passion, ag­gression, and self-grasping arises from is overcome by refutational reasoning with the result that since there is nothing grasped at, there is no grasping to it\" meaning that when the object's lack of truth is determined, the elaboration of grasping at truth in the ob­ject falls apart because an object is posited in relation to its per­ceiver. Then, as for cutting exaggeration internally, like Saraha said, \"To find what is in the house you go outside. You question the neighbours having seen the owner.\" in other words, the co-emergent wisdom existing within oneself is brought to realization by the guru's kindness27• Second, the distinction between individually discriminating prajfta and self-knowing wisdom is as follows. The first relies on examina­tion and analysis-like melting, cutting, and rubbing gold-to dis­cover a certain fact which is viewed as non-deceptive. The second is that, from a state of non-examination/non-analysis/non-alter­ation/non-fabrication, the fact of one's own face shining forth from within self-arising wisdom is seen; that is called \"individual, self­knowing wisdom\" .28 26 This is the Kagyu way of commenting on these famous words and Gyal­wang Je is aware of that. Other schools have their own interpretation based on their emphasis on the understanding of the second turning of the wheel. 27 In other words, instead of recognizing what you have inside you, you go outside to look for it; outside, you question the neighbours about the own­er, your self, even though you have already seen it because you live with it.

Also, the distinction between them is like the difference between what the King of Samadhis Siitra says about the former, \"For a given dharma, non-self is to be individually discri­minated. If one meditates on what that is for each one individu­ally, That is the cause of the fruit obtaining nirvfu).a, Any other cause will not bring peace.\" and the meaning of the latter one as stated by Saraha, \"The Archer advocated self-ness awareness 'Free from all doings and not from accumulation' 28 ( ••• continued) that case refers to the fact that the praj:fia is isolating things, dissecting them so that each thing is individually correctly discriminated and known con­ceptually. The result is that, on the basis of that kind of individual discern­ment, one arrives at an individually discerned understanding that is taken to be non-deceptive and hence liberative. On the other hand, without any analysis whatsoever, in a state which is not modified at all by conceptual analysis, it is possible to meet face to face with one's own mind. When such a meeting happens, it comes forth from the primordial state of know­ing (wisdom) which is not produced in reliance on anything but only arises because of itself. This self-arising wisdom is an individual wisdom that is self aware, hence it is called individual, self-knowing wisdom. Note that the words for these terms \"individually discriminating praj:fia\" and \"indi­vidual self-aware wisdom\" look very similar on the surface (and are often confused as being the same). However, they are light years apart in what they are and the paths to enlightenment that they represent. Prajna dis­criminates things one at a time and in the end conceptually decides on a state; wisdom sees itself at one time and sees all of reality at once."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"84 PROFOUND VIEW IN THE DRUKPA KAGYU At that time the heart of every expert is covered with poison.\" In addition, the tantra when it gives such as, \"This wisdom being great is subtle ... 29\" and, \"Not realized by conceptual process, This wisdom is self-knowing.\" is asserting realization through reliance on the guru's blessings. Generally experts are of two kinds: experts in conventional areas of knowledge; and experts in the meaning of reality3°. The first is like the pat).c,iitas who are expert in the five areas of knowledge and the latter is like the yogins who are expert in the meaning of reality. Also, for the first, as Nagarjuna said, \"Without relying on conventions The absolute meaning will not be realized\" and, for the second, as Saraha said, \"When you become realized, that is everything­Other than that, nobody will discover anything.

These final determi­nations are called your \"grub mtha\"', which translates well into English with \"tenets\". This is the well-known usage of the term.

This is direct perception of reality and the direct understanding that is afforded by it is the yogin's \"tenet\" system. The author is pointing out that a logically derived tenet is not the only usage of the word \"grub.mtha\"' in the tradition. It is also used to mean the tenet of a yogin, a tenet which is derived through practice and direct meet­ing with the reality afforded by his system of practice.

The two truths which, at the time of not being realized, appear to a per­son's rational mind as very separate are in fact95 just one thing.

The mode of there being no distinction in (superior) meaning can also be understood from this. At the point when the distinction is being posited for the temporary circumstance, the Kalachakra teaches an upadeSha that creates a distinction between body and thought then teaches also that \"it is, in accordance with tantra, hidden\". And, the meaning of this-''by a supreme, original buddha being unknown, mantra vehicle is unknown\" -which is also taught in the precious tantra section, is that, too. To continue with this, a practitioner whose body has been made principally into method will have a thought that is principally praj­fta and one whose body has been made principally into prajfta will have a thought that is principally method; it is like males and fe­males138. Thought there means what? It is \"the thought that is seeking what is meaningful\" and that it is the thought for enlightenment139 that sees meaningfulness in the accomplishment of other's aims. These two types of tantric practitioner, having seen that the accomplishment of other's aims in its entirety is present in a buddha, have a thought directing their efforts at a specific method of accomplishing buddhahood.

Because of that, the other possible meanings of the negated form are either forgotten in general or over-ridden in particular by those theo­rists of the Buddhist tradition who insist that they know all the answers and are correct but who are not aware of the other meanings of the term. The negated term not only means 1) \"in dualistic mind but that mind is not engaging objects\" as is accepted by people who only know about the siitra conventions but also means 2) \"not in dualistic mind\", \"not having the functions of a dualistic mind\" and further even, 3) ''being in a non­dualistic mind\", ''being in the kind of state where dharmas arise as the na­ture (the essence of mind, luminosity), a state where there is none of the occurrence (doings) of thinking mind\". His explanation here should be extremely useful to us. It points out meanings that anyone wanting to understand the tantras needs to know in order not to mistakenly interpret them as has historically been done by at least one Tibetan lineage. It also brings home yet again the point that there is a distinct difference between the approaches of the common vehicle, the siitra system, and the uncommon vehicle, the tantra system. It illustrates the point that there could be a reference to non 'general thinking mind ac­tivity' that is not merely a negation of the objects that would otherwise be seen by that mind but could refer to the situation of the very essence of mind that will experience a full range of phenomena without there being any of the discursive, dualistic mind."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"30. �, �fie 4atd ...
