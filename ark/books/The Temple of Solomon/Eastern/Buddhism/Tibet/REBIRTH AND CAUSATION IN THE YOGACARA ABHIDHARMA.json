I attempt to identify the sources of this exposition, and I show its relationship both to Sarvastivadin abhidharma and to other, mostly rather early, Yogacara texts. I also find evidence suggesting that relevant portions of the Abhidharmakosabha�ya, some of which have been previously described as Sautrantika, are in essential agreement with Yogacara abhidharma. An examination of the Sarvastivadin literature shows that an exposition of conditioned origination similar to that of the Abhidharmasamuccaya cannot be found in any Sarvastivadin work. However, there are many features common to the exposition in the Abhidharmasamuccaya and several passages on conditioned origination in the Yogacarabhumi. In this study, I show how material from the Yogacarabhumi has undergone further doctrinal development and refinemerit in the Abhidharmasamuccaya and the Abhidharma­samuccayabha�ya. I also suggest that the Dasabhumikasutra was a source for portions of the expositions in both the Yogacarabhumi and the Abhidharmasamuccaya. Like large portions of the Yogacarabhumi, the Abhidharma­samuccaya, although it is generally classified as a Yogacara text, does not contain much in the way of explicitly Yogacara terminology. The terms alayavijiiana and bija are used sparingly in the Abhidharma­samuccaya, and they do not appear in the exposition of pratitya­samutpada. However, I suggest that the concept of alayavijiiana, or at least a theory of causatiori by seeds, underlies what the Abhidharma­samuccaya says about conditioned origination in three different contexts: the arising of conditioned dharmas in general, the process of rebirth, and the mechanism of cognition."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"· viii When I first approached the Abhidharmasamuccaya, I attempted to use the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya of Vasubandhu in order to compare the Yogacara abhidharma found in the Abhidharmasamuccaya with Sarvastivadin abhidharma. After all, the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya has generally been considered to be a compendium of Va ibhii�ika abhidharma peppered with Vasubandhu's occasional lapses from orthodoxy. However, although I was 1iware from the start that Vasubandhu often favors a position that he or his commentators identify as Sautrantika, I was increasingly impressed as I compared the two texts by the similarity between Vasubandhu's \"Sautrantika\" opinions and the Yogacara position, which can generally be traced to the Yogiiciirabhumi. This has lead me to suspect that Vasubandhu already accepted Yogacara doctrine when he wrote the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya. Returning to the three contexts of conditioned origination, I have noticed, in the case of the arising of all conditioned dharmas, a connection between the expositions of conditioned origination in the Abhidharmasamuccaya and the Yogiiciirabhumi and expositions of the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras in the same texts. In all of these passages, we find similar explanations for observable aspects of the functioning of causes and results, for example: the fact that the series of causes and results is unbroken-the fact that a particular cause has only its appropriate result, etc. These explanations all appeal to a reinterpretation of the statements of conditioned origination attributed to the Buddha: \"If this exists, that comes into existence\"; and \"Because of the origination of this, that originates.\" This reinterpretation, as 1 show, is based on a theory of causation by seeds. The major difference between the Yogacara and Sarvastivadin categories of cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras lies in the fact that Yogacara considers them to be merely designations, frequently of aspects of causation, and not real dharmas. Real dharmas are not required; the very nature of conditioned things, as described in the pratityasamutpiida expositions, is sufficient to explain how they operate causally. As laini has suggested (1977: 110), Vasubandhu's Sautrantika criticisms of the reality of the cittaviprayuktasa1!lskiiras are similar to the Yogacara dismissal of the category as mere designation. In this study, I show that"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"IX a number of his specific criticisms can be traced directly to the Yogiiciirabhumi. Similarly, in the context of rebirth, I show that Vasubandhu's own opinion in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, as well as in later texts in which he openly espouses Yogacara, is much closer to the two­lifetimes/singlefold causation theory of the Abhidharmasamuccaya than to the three-lifetimes/twofold theory of Sarvastivada. Here again a comparison of the Yogaciira abhidharma of the Abhidharmasamuccaya with the Sautrantika positions of Vasubandhu supports my contention that they are actually Yogacara positions even though Vasubandhu never identifies them as such. Finally, in the context of cognition, the Abhidharmasamuccaya and the Yogiiciirabhumi accept the reality of sparsa as a separate dharma, as well as the existence of pleasurable feeling (sukhavedanii). I suggest that both of these positions are related to iilayavijiiiina. Here the Yogaciira position agrees with Sarvastivada and disagrees with the non­Sarvastivadin positions mentioned in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya. It is significant that Vasubandhu rejects the dissenting position in these cases: he supports them and identifies them as Sautrantika only when, and because, they are consonant with Yogacara."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"I. INTRODUCTION A. Background Conditioned origination (pratltyasamutpiida) is one of the most famous and fundamental doctrines of Buddhism. As La Vallee Poussin has pointed out in Theorie des Douze Causes, I only the tea<:hings of the Four Noble Truths and the five skandhas can surpass it in importance. The underlying principle of conditioned origination is that existence in the world of saf!lsiira unfolds in a series of causes and results; these results can be negated by the destruction of their causes, a process that can be accomplished only by proper insight and practice and the completion of which is equivalent to the attainment of nirviilJa. The \"discovery\" of conditioned origination is often identified with the Buddha's experience in meditation under the Bodhi tree. However, the various formulas with varying numbers of links in the causal chain and culminating in the well-known, twelve-membered (dviidasiinga) formula, are generally considered to be later developments. The twelve members of the formula familiar from texts beginning with the later Nikiiyas2 are: Ignorance (avidyii), the Karmic Forces (saf!lskiira), Consciousness (vijiiiina), Individual Existence (niimarupa), the Six Senses (�a4iiyatana), Contact (spada), Feeling (vedanii), Subconscious Desire (tr�lJii), Appropriation (upiidiina), Karmic Existence (bhava), Birth (jiiti), and Old Age and Death (jariimaralJa).3 Although these twelve had become standard by the time of the abhidharma, the exact causal relationship among the members is by no '1913: v. This monograph is probably the most important work on pratitya­samutpiida even though it was published more than eighty years ago. It should be read by anyone interested in the subject. 'The Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary refers to Sa'!lyuttanikiiya 11.5 ff. (Rhys Davids and Stede 1986: 394). See also Cox 1993: 126. 'Some of these translations are more or less standard, while others have been borrowed or adapted from the works of other scholars. Acknowledgements can be found in the notes to Chapter 2."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2 means clear, and difficulties in explaining the relationships between certain of them led to rather disparate interpretations of the formula among Buddhist philosophers. Sometimes, as we shall see, more than one explanation can be found in the works of the same school, or even in a single work. Needless to say, more striking differences can be found between expositions offered by different schools. The best-known interpretation of conditioned origination is that of the Sarvastivadins, particularly in the form presented by Vasubandhu in the third chapter of the Abhidharmakosa. According to this interpretation, Ignorance and the Karmic Forces represent the past lifetime, which is the cause of Consciousness, Individual Existence, the Six Senses, Contact, and Feeling in the present life. The remainder of the members assigned to the present life, i.e., Subconscious Desire, Appropriation, and Karmic Existence, are the cause of Birth and Old Age and Death in . the future life. Some Yogacara texts, on the other hand, assign the members in a very different way, over a period of two lifetimes rather than three, probably due to the fact that the Yogacara conception of Consciousness was radically different fr om that of Sarvastivada. One can argue (as I shall below) that some of the expositions of conditioned origination in the Yogiiciirabhumi are at least closer to the two-lifetime interpretation than to the three-lifetime interpretation. However, the earliest incontrovertible example of what is referred to by Chinese commentators and modem Japanese scholars as the two-lifetime/singlefold system, and its locus classicus, is fo und in the Abhidharmasamuccaya. In addition, the exposition of conditioned origination in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, although quite short, contains a number of other features that cannot be found in Sarvastivadin or any other extant Hinayana abhidharma text but that do appear in other Yo gacara texts, most notably the Yogiiciirabhumi. Furthermore, not only is it important for an understanding of Yogacara views of causality and rebirth, but it also sheds light on the grounds fo r Vasubandhu's disagreement with Sarvastivada concerning these subjects. The significance of the treatment of pratityasamutpiida in the Abhidharmasamuccaya was noted as early as 1947 by Gokhale, who, in"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"3 introducing the Sanskrit fragments of the Abhidharmasamuccaya, mentioned it as one of the topics in the text meriting special study (14). Rahula of course included this section in his French translation of the Abhidharmasamuccaya (1980: 42-44), but he neither translated nor referred to the corresponding passage of the Abhidharmasamuccaya­bha$ya. More recently, Matsuda has studied the interpretation of the pratltyasamutpada formula in the Abhidharmasamuccaya in connection with the A-divise$avibhagasutra and Vasubandhu's Pratltyasamutpada­vyakhya (1982a). He has also published a very accurate Japanese translation of the pratltyasamutpada portions of both the Abhidharma­samuccaya and the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii$ya (1983), which is accompanied by an excellent introduction and bibliographical notes; however, he has not analyzed the contents in depth. Here, I provide an English translation of the pratltyasamutpiida sections of both the text and the commentary, and I discuss some of the more important issues related to the exposition of pratltyasamutpiida in the Abhidharmasamuccaya.4 In my discussion, I refer to some related texts, most notably the section on pratltyasamutpada in the Savitarkadibhumi of the Maulfbhumi of the Yogacarabhumi (198.9-232.15), which seems to have been the major source of this section of the Abhidharmasamuccaya. I also compare the Abhidharmasamuccaya with Sarvastivadin materials, from which it often differs considerably, and with Vasubandhu's own, so-called \"Sautrantika,\" positions in the Abhidharmakosabha$ya, which frequently are closer to what is found in the Yo gaciirabhumi and the Abhidharmasamuccaya than to Sarvastivada. That the author(s) or compiler of the Abhidharmasamuccaya knew 4Throughout this work, I primarily refer to, translate from, and give the text of Sanskrit editions when they are available. If, as in the case, for example, of large sections of the Yogiiciirabhiimi, the Sanskrit is unavailable, I provide both the Tibetan and Chinese versions. In some cases, I also provide references to the Chinese or to the Tibetan and Chinese even if the Sanskrit is available. Of course, I mention any significant differences among the versions, particularly of the texts that I translate in Chapter 2, of which I am aware. When giving Sanskrit text, I generally follow the practice of the editor of each text regarding punctuation and the breaking up of compounds."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"4 the doctrine of iilayavijiiiina is clear: indeed, in the section immediately following ours, the causal condition (hetupratyaya) is defined as iilayavijiiiina together with the impressions of good (i.e., the mok�abhiiglyadharmas).5 However, many discussions in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, including the exposition of pratltyasamutpiida, fail to mention the term iilayavijiiiina or even to refer to the concept with a related term, although their contexts would seem to offer an opportunity to expound this crucial doctrine. On the other hand, there is nothing in the discussion of pratltyasamutpiida that would contradict the doctrine of iilayavijiiiina. This tendency to avoid referring to iilayavijiiiina raises questions about the nature and purpose of the Abhidharmasamuccaya as a whole, questions that perhaps cannot fully be answered �ithout a deeper understanding of the development of Mahayana Yogacara from pre-Mahayana sources. Thanks to Schmithausen's monumental work, Alayavijiiiina (1987), 5hetupratyayah katama�? iilayavijiiiina1!1 kusalaviisanii ca (Abhidharma­samuccaya: 27). The Abh idharmasamuccayabhii�ya explains that iilayavijiiiina is the causal condition of defiled sa1!1skiiras, while the kusalaviisaniis are the causal condition of pure sa1!1skiiras, respectively (hetupratyava iilayavijiiiinam\" kusalaviisanii ca siisraviiniisraviil}ii1!1 ca sa1!1skiiriil}ii1!1 yathiikramam-35.26-36.1). This separation of iilayavijiiiina and the kusalaviisaniis suggests that iilayavijiiiina here functions as \"a principle of Pollution\" (Schmithausen 1987: 76 ff.). Schmithausen says this is characteristic of certain early Yogadira texts (including portions of the Yogiiciirabhumi) but not of others (including other portions of the Yogiiciirabhumi). The Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya further explains that the kusalaviisaniis are the impressions of the mok� abhiigZvas (kusalaviisanii mok�abhiigZviinii1!1 viisanii dra�!avyii-35.26-36.1). I am grateful to Professor P.S. laini for pointing out that it is strange that only the mok�abhiigfyas are mentioned here, and not the nirvedhabhiig�vas as well, since the two are usually found together. For example, Schmithausen discusses a passage from the Yogiiciirabhumi in which it is said that iilayavijiiiina \"incorporates the Seeds of the basic wholesome dharmas (kusalamula) [indirectly] conducive to liberation (mok�abhiigfya) and of those [directly] leading up to penetration [into Truth] (nirvedhabhiigfya)\" (1987: 78). Incidentally, he mentions this passage in the context of a portion of the Yogiiciirabhumi that generally takes iilayavijiiiina in the sense of a principle of Pollution; he considers this particular passage, which clearly allows iilayavijiiiina a more ·positive function, to be an interpolation. Unfortunately, I am unable to explain why the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya omits the nirvedhabhiig�vas; it does not seem to be a scribal error, since neither the Tibetan translations nor the Chinese include them."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"5 we are now able to approach the Yo gacarabhumi with some hope of sorting out its variol,ls strata, some of which, as he has shown, presuppose alayavijiiana, while others do not. Since the Abhidharma­samuccaya and the Abhidharmasamuccayabha:;ya appear to depend on the Yo gacarabhumi for much of their material, it is useful to compare the pertinent sections of the Yo gacarabhumi with those of the Abhidharmasamuccaya and the Abhidharmasamuccayabha:;ya. By doing so, we can understa'ld what kind of sources the Abhidharma­samuccaya drew upon and to what extent it altered or developed the source material. B. Concerning the Biography of Asanga 1. Reservations about the Authorship of the Abhidharmasamuccaya It may seem strange that I have not mentioned the name Asanga earlier, although the fact that I refer to \"the author(s) or compiler\" of the Abhidharmasamuccaya probably suggests my reasons for not having done so. Schmithausen, in a discussion of the composition of the Yogacarabhumi, which he considers to be a compilation of material by various authors, raises the possibility that \"at least some of the remaining works of the [so-called Mai.treya Asanga] complex (e.g. the Hsien-yang-sheng-chiao-lun and even the Abhidharmasamuccaya) do not lack compilatory fe atures either\" (1987: 189). I am more willing than Schmithausen to search for Yogacara theories underlying expositions that do not employ explicitly Yo gacara terminology. Therefore, I am able to acc-.:pt the possibility that the same author can make a clearly Mahayana statement in one context while, in Schmithausen's words, doing \"his best to avoid specifically Mahayana interpretations\" (1987: 193) in another. At the same time, in reading the Abhidharmasamuccaya, I am never aware of the personality of the author in the way that I am when I read, for example, Va subandhu's Abhidharmakosabha:;ya. I admit that this is merely an impression and not a basis for denying Asanga's authorship, but in the present study I simply refer to \"the Abhidharmasamuccaya\" rather than to \"Asanga.\" Although I do not attempt to prove my suspicions regarding Asanga's"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"6 authorship of the Abhidharmasamuccaya, I believe that my comparison of the expositions of pratityasamutpiida in the Abhidharmasamuccaya and the Savitarkiidibhumi suggests that these two texts were not written by the same person. The relationship between these two expositions therefore casts further doubt on the traditional attribution of both the Yo giiciirabhumi, in toto, and the Abhidharmasamuccaya to a single author, Asailga. Although I do not refer to Asailga as the author of the Abhidharma­samuccaya, he is still generally considered such, and the traditional biographies raise some interesting issues that are worth discussing here. There are four important sources for biographical information about Asailga: Paramartha's biography of Vasubandhu, P'o su p 'an tou fa shih chuan �!M\\!l;.Ri*Bfflft. cr. 2049);6 the Ta t'ang hsi yii chi :kFt!fP§t.IDG �c of Hsiian-tsang 3z:�/ Bu-ston's Chos 'byun;8 and Taranatha's rGya gar chos 'byun.9 As the accounts of Asailga's life have been summarized by various scholars including Levi (1911, v. 2: 1-7), Wayman (1961: 25-41), Rahula (1966: 133-136; 1980: ix-xiii), Willis (1982: 3-12), and Griffiths (1986: 174 n. 7, 9), I do not include a summary here. However, there are two points concerning Asailga's biography about which I should like to comment: the question of his Hinayana school and the authorship of the Yo giiciirabhumi. The fIrst point pertains not only to the understanding of the texts ascribed to Asailga, but also to the corpus of Va subandhu, in sofar as both fig ures are said to have converted to Mahayana in the middle of their careers. 10 The second point is crucial in establishing the history of the development of early Yogacara thought and is a matter of considerable controversy. Wayman and Schmithausen disagree strongly concerning each point, and in both cases I fInd Schmithausen more convincing. Since ·188-191; English translation by Takakusu (1904). , 7T. 2087: 896b20-897a7; English translation by, among others, Beal (1983: 22<l1 229). \"Bu stan chas 'bywi: 837.7 ff.; English translation by Obermiller (1986: 136-147). \"English translation by Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya (1970: 154-1 75). Jill comment in Chapter 5 on how the traditional biography of Vasubandhu has influenced scholarly opinion concerning his doctrinal development."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"7 these points are pertinent to many of my observations and arguments, I must address them in detail. If I focus too much on the opinions of these two scholars, it is because they have expressed the alternative positions most clearly. 2. Asanga's Hinayana School According to Paramartha, Asanga was associated with the Sarvastivada school before converting to Mahayana (T. 2049: 188eI). Hsiian-tsang, on the other hand, states that he was associated with the Mahisasaka school (T. 2087: 896b28). The two Tibetan sources, although including elaborate stories of the ordeals Asanga underwent before receiving Mahayana teachings from Maitreya (Obermiller 1986: 137-140; Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1970: 155-161), do not contain explicit accounts of his conversion and do not mention his having belonged to a Hinayana school, let alone specify to which school he belonged. Thus, as far as the historical or pseudo-historical tradition goes, only Hsiian-tsang identifies Asanga's Hinayana school as MahiSasaka. In his Analysis of the Sriivakabhumi Manuscript, Wayman argues that Hsiian-tsang is correct. Wayman first gives several possible explanations for the difference between Hsiian-tsang's and Paramartha's accounts: (1) Paramartha may be referring to Asanga's ordination lineage, not his doctrinal beliefs; (2) Asanga may have been a Sarvastivadin before becoming a Mahisasaka; (3) Mahisasaka was, in any case, a branch of Sarvastivada or Miilasarvastivada, so Hsiian-tsang and Paramartha are both correct (1961: 25). These explanations are not unreasonable, at least at first glance. In support of the first one is Paramartha's wording: \"He [Asanga] too became a priest in the Sat-ba-ta (Sarvasti-vada) school.\"11 The phrase that Takakusu translates as \"became a priest,\" ch 'u chia H:l * (Sanskrit pravraj-), refers to ordination; when Paramartha refers to doctrine, he uses the word i :#;, as for example when he says that Vasubandhu used \"Takakusu 1904: 273. The original is iJJ;�Nii$�l'ir,i±l%<: (T. 2049: IS8el)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"8 Sautrantika doctrine to refute Sarvastivada.12 However, the same argument can be applied to Hsiian-tsang's account, according to which Asailga was ordained into, and practiced with, the MahIsasaka school but after a short time came to believe in Mahayana.13 If Paramartha, as Wayman suggests, is referring only to Asailga's ordination lineage and not to his doctrinal beliefs, it is equally possible that Hsiian-tsang, depending upon what he means by the word \"practice,,,14 is doing the same thing. In any case, even if one is willing to trust sources such as these, which are full of fantastic and hagiographical elements, Hsiian-tsang's attribution seems to me to be no more authoritative than Paramartha's. Wayman, however, does not rely exclusively on historical records to S\\lpport his case that Asailga belonged to, and believed in the doctrines of, the Mahisasaka school. He also examines several points of doctrine that are discussed in the Yogiiciirabhiimi, the sole authorship of which he attributes to Asailga, and the Abhidharmasamuccaya, noting their similarity to doctrines attributed to the Mahisasakas (1961: 26-29). Wayman's arguments here have already been criticized at length and convincingly by Schmithausen (1970: 94-95, 115-119). In a later study, \"Doctrinal Affiliation of the Buddhist Master Asailga,\" which seems to have been prompted by criticisms of his conclusions in the Analysis, Wayman summarizes his earlier arguments and adds a number of others (1989: 210-213). Since we have no Mahisasaka texts aside from the Chinese translation (T. 1421, T. 1422) of the Mahisasaka vinaya (Bareau 1955: 182), Wayman necessarily relies on the traditional accounts of the doctrinal beliefs of the sects, particularly Vasumitra's, and the summary ofthese accounts in Bareau's Les Sectes Bouddhiques du Petit Vehicule (1955). Lamotte, in his History of Indian Buddhism, discusses these sources, which he frequently characterizes as \"pseudo-historical,\" at considerable length. Although he allows that \"the disputations provide an exact idea of the 12.:iLjIi�tp.g:��!liifffll$�j..:U�liM�ji,&:z (T. 2049: 190b 15-16). 131ft5fffiy�g:�I±\\*fl��o i;WZJIDf§*,* (T. 2087: 89628-29b). 14Nakamura, referring to the Sarrzghabhedavastu of the Sarviistiviidin vinaya, lists brahmacaryarrz carati as one of the Sanskrit equivalents of fl�� (Nakamura 1975: 624). This would suggest that the term has nothing to do with doctrine."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"9 doctrinal orientation of the great Buddhist sects,\" he concludes that \"it is doubtful whether the sects themselves established the list of propositions which the disputations attribute to them and even more doubtful that they imposed adherence to them on all those who, for historical or geographical reasons, belonged to the same creed as themselves or lived in their district.\" Furthermore, he points out that the most important Buddhist authors are eclectic and do not necessarily believe in all of the doctrinal positions held by the schools to which they at least nominally belong (Lamotte 1988: 521 -522). Wayman, to be sure, qualifies his argument by recognizing this fad: \"It was not my theory that Asanga, in going along with the Mahlsasaka, is committed to the fuHlist of the tenets ascribed to this sect in the rather brief works devoted to the theories of the eighteen Buddhist sects, and. where often the tenets are expressed with too much brevity\" (1989: 213). Nevertheless, in the case ofVasumitra's account Wayman is again perhaps too willing to take at face value sources of dubious historical accuracy, and throughout both of the works I have mentioned, he treats Asanga as though he were a thoroughly historical figure, the details of whose career can be accurately known from the materials available. In \"Doctrinal Affiliation,\" Wayman presents two additional arguments in support of Asanga's having been a Mahisasaka. The first concerns the Hinayana scriptural sources of the Yogiiciirabhumi and, like all of Wayman's arguments, is based on the assumption that Asanga is the sole author of the Yogiiciirabhumi. Wayman has identified verses from the Saf!'lyuttanikiiya, the Udiinavarga, and the Suttanipiita that are, or the Sanskrit equivalents of which are, the sources for the tSarzriirthagiithii of the Cintiimayzbhumi of the Yogiiciirabhumi, and he concludes with the following remarks: \"Asanga exhibits within his vast learning a control of those matters which are of vital interest to the Theravada sect of Buddhism, especially as concerns the content of such Pali works as the Netti-Pakara1'}a and the Sutta-nipiita. In terms of Bareau's theory that the Mahlsasaka were the India-based counterparts of the Theravada, this compatibility of Asanga's views with the Theravada supports a theory that Asanga belonged to the Mahisasa.I<:a,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"10 but does not prove it\" (1989: 210).15 However, if one glances through Honj6's A Table of Agama-citations in the Abhidharmakosa and the Abhidharmako�[sic]opiiyikii (1984), one can find the same set of texts cited frequently in an essentially Sarvastivadin context. This suggests to me that \"those matters which are of vital interest to the Theravada secf' (and therefore to the Mahisasaka sect) were actually of as vital interest to Sarvastivada as to the author, or authors, of the Yogiiciirabhumi. In fact, if one does not accept AsaiJ.ga's authorship of the Yogiiciirabhumi, one could conceivably adduce the same evidence as proof of the Sarvastiviidin background of its author(s). Perhaps I am not doing justice to this argument of Wayman's, but to the extent to which I understand it, it does not convince me of AsaiJ.ga's. association with the Mahisasaka school. In his final argument, Wayman refers to a passage from the Mahiisarrtnipiitasutra, which says of certain disciples that they \"will not conceive notions (sarrtJiiii) of the earth, or those of water, of fire, of wind, of space (iikiisa), or of consciousness (vijiiiina). Those persons will accordingly be called MahIsasaka\" (1989: 213). Wayman understands this to mean that \"those called MahIsasaka, by avoiding notions of the six elements, accept cittamiitra, also accept only the fo ur great elements, plus iikiisa, to explain man basically\" (1989: 214). He then compares this passage to a discussion of cittamiitra from the ViniscayasarrtgrahaJJi of the Yogiiciirabhumi, which he translates and about which he says: \"The term cittamiitra as here used implies an ideal man, that it is possible to reach, presumably by yoga, a state of pure consciousness (cittamiitra) free from derived consciousness (caitta). As a corollary, one reaches a state of just four elements (mahiibhuta) free '5Bareau (1993) examines the lists of asa1fls/q\"tadharmas in the Yogiiciirabhumi (Manobhumi) and the Hsien yang sheng chiao {un lm:t����. He adduces the similarity between these lists and that of the MahiSiisaka school (according to Vasumitra's Samayabhedoparacanacakra) as evidence in support of Wayman's opinion regarding AsaiJga's affiliation with Mahisiisaka. I have not had a chance to explore this subject in detail. Before commenting on Bareau's article, I would have to go through the couple of dozen references to the asa111s/q\"tas in other portions of the Yogiiciirabhumi as well as Harivarman's discussion of this subject in the Ta ttvasiddhisiistra."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"11 from derived elements (bhautika). At that time one would be free of notions (saT!ljiia)\" (1989: 215). Finally, Wayman comes to his conclusions concerning the name Mahisasaka: It is because they teach the six elements as constituting man's \"earth\" they have the name meaning \"who teach the earth\" - the earth of which one should have no notions - those six elements. And taking Asailga's passage [i.e., the Yogacarabhumi passage] into account, it is undeniable that his celebrated theory of Cittamatra is bound up with the scriptural passage about the six elements. Is this not, then, a justification for the terminology of the seventeen bhumis? The word bhumi means \"earth\" as does mahto Hence, Asailga's bhumi system, involving in a \"place\" the alteration between the citta and the caitta, as between the mahabhuta and the bhautika, is not an upward progression, as the very titles of the seventeen show (Wayman 1989: 215). I have had to quote so many sections of Wayman's final argument because I am not confident that I understand it well enough to summarize it. However, as far as I can tell the argument is rather speculative and not likely to convince anyone who is not already strongly disposed to agree with him that Asailga was a Mahisasaka. Although I do not think that Wayman has proved that Asailga was a Mahisasaka, I can understand his reasons for trying to establish Asailga's Hinayana school. As Wayman points out in his Analysis, the Yogaciirabhumi is essentially abhidharma, and, as such, it is based on sutras that are predominantly, if not exclusively, Hinayana. Considering Asailga to have been the author, Wayman assumes that those portions of the Yogacarabhumi that are based on Hinayana sutras must represent the views of Asailga's Hinayana sect. Hence, according to Wayman, Yogacara abhidharma, for that is what much of the Yogacarabhumi is, consists of the addition of some Mahayana material to the abhidharma of a specific Hinayana school, Mahisasaka; in his words, \"Asailga did not give up his Hinayana views but simply added part of the Mahayana to those\" (1961: 45). In this way, Wayman explains the coexistence of"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"12 long stretches of material that seem to have no Mahayana content with occasional passages that can be identified as Yogacara or Mahayana. In order to explain the preponderance of Hlnayana material in certain portions of the text and the concentration of the Mahayana material in other portions, he proposes in \"Doctrinal Affiliations\" a relative chronology of the composition of the Yo giiciirabhumi. First, AsaIiga composed the Sriivakabhumi and the Samiihitabhumi at a very early age, then the Paryiiyasa1!lgrahm',ll, the Va stusa1!lgrahal}l, and the SrutamaYI-, CintamaYI-, and BhiivaniimaYlbhumis, all before his conversion to Mahayana. After his conversion, he wrote the Bodhisattvabhumi, the remainder of the Bhumivastu, and the Viniscayasa1!lgrahal}l (Wayman 1-989: 203). This chronology, incidentally, is quite different from those. proposed by Schmithausen16 and Aramaki17 (discussed in Chapter 5). Presumably, Wayman would explain the contents of the Abhidharmasamuccaya, which he describes as a \"condensation of material from the Yo gaciirabhumi\" (1961: 33), in the same way, that is, as Mahisasaka doctrine with some Mahayana additions. However, if the intent of the Abhidharmasamuccaya is to summarize the Mahisasaka abhidharma contained in the Yo giiciirabhumi, why does it include so much Mahayana material? After all, as Walpola Rahula observes, the Abhidharmasamuccaya contains nearly all the major doctrines of Mahayana (1980: xiv). And (I assume here for the sake of argument that AsaIiga is the sole author of the Abhidharmasamuccaya) if AsaIiga had already been converted to Mahayana before writing the Abhi­dharmasamuccaya, why would he have repeated the Mahisasaka material that he�had already included in those portions of the Yogiiciirabhumi that he wrote before he was converted? Wayman says \"According to Schmithausen, there are three main layers: (I) parts of the Bhiimivastu (= Maullbhiimi), including the Sr iivakabhiimi and the Bodhisattvabhiimi, and the Vastusarrzgraha1Jl; (2) the remainder of the Bhiimivastu; (3) the Vi niscayasarrzgraha1Jl (1987: 14). '7Aramaki also distinguishes three layers, but the contents of the second two are different: (I) the Sriivakabhiimi, the BodhisattvabhfJ.mi, and the Va stusarrzgraha1Jl; (2) portions of the Sarrzdhinirmocana and portions of the Vi niscayasarrzgraha1Jl; (3) the remainder of the Vi niscayasarrzgraha1Jl and the first nine bhUmis of the Bhiimivastu (personal communication)."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"13 that Asailga simply added Mahayana views to Hlnayanaones, but surely the conversion of a philosopher like Asailga would involve a more radical shift in outlook than Wayman would have us believe. It seems far more likely to me that the Abhidharmasamuccaya is creating (or refining) a new, Mahayana abhidharma. This is not to say that it does not include a lot of material that can be found in the Hinayana abhidharma, particularly that of Sarvastivada and perhaps, as Davidson suggests (1989: 254), its branches. However the Abhidharma­samuccaya is not, I think, committed to the doctrines of any Hlnayana school. Rather, instead of relying specifically on the abhidharma of, for example, the MahIsasakas, the author of the Abhidharmasamuccaya (and other Yogacara abhidharma authors), like the authors of HInayana abhidharma texts, draws much of his material directly from the sutras and from the earlier abhidharma of his own (Le., the Yogacara) school. In my analysis of the pratityasamutpiida section of the Abhidharma­samuccaya, I hope to illustrate its extensive reliance on, and refmement of, ideas fo und in the Yo giiciirabhumi. Furthermore, I believe that the interpretation of sutra in the Yo giiciirabhumi, even sometimes in the earliest portions, does not follow the abhidharma of its author's (or authors') putative Hlnayana school, but instead is based on Yogacara ideas. The fascinating question of whether all Yogacara is Mahayana is outside of the scope of this study. 3. The Authorship ofthe Yo giiciirabhumi The other major 'issue raised by the biographical sources is the ,authorship of the Yo giiciirabhumi. Again, the traditional accounts differ. According to Paramartha, Maitreya, at Asailga's request, came down fr om Tu�ita heaven to p,reach the Shih ch 'i ti ching i--l::;:I'II!.*.! (= Yo giiciirabhumi) at night, while during the day, Asailga, who was the only one who could approach Maitreya, explained Maitreya's speech to the rest of the audience (T. 2049: 188cI4-20; Takakusu 1904: 274-275). According to Hsiian-tsang, on the other hand, Asailga ascended to Maitreya's palace at night and received from him the Yo giiciirabhumi (I� f1Jn rup:l'll!. i�), the Mahiiyiinasutriilarflkiira (* * m: � *.!), the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"14 Madhyiintavibhiiga (J:j:l �5t53U�iJj;) and other texts, which he later explained to the masses (T. 2087: 896b21-24; Beal 1983: 226).l8 The Tibetan tradition is more willing to attribute the actual authorship of the Yo giiciirabhiimi to Asailga. Bu-ston first tells the story of Asailga's ascent to Tu�ita heaven, where Maitreya expounds the Prajiiiipiiramitii, the Yo giiciirabhiimi, and other Mahayana siitras. In order to elucidate these scriptures, Maitreya composes the five works of Maitreya,l9 which Asailga brings down to earth. However, Bu-ston shortly thereafter states that Asailga composed \"his great treatise in five divisions\" (in other words, the Yo gaciirabhiimi) after his return to earth (Obermiller 1986: 139-140). In Taranatha's version of the same story, Asailga, after arriving in Tu�ita heaven, \"listened to the Mahayana doctrine in its entirety from Aj itanatha [Maitreyanatha] and learnt the real significance of the whole collection of siitra-s. Then he listened to the 'Five Works of Maitreya'\" (Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1970: 159). Unlike Bu-ston, Tiiranatha does not mention the Yo giiciirabhiimi as one of the texts preached to Asailga by Maitreya. However, Taranatha does mention the Yo giiciirabhiimi as one of the treatises written by Asailga some time after his return fr om Tu�ita heaven (Chimp a and Chattopadhyaya 1970: 160). Both Bu-ston and Taranatha, in their sections on the life of Vasubandhu, relate a story according to which Vasubandhu, hearing or reading a work or some works of Asailga, criticized Asailga: Alas, Asanga, residing in the forest, Has practised meditation for 12 years. Without having attained anything by his meditation, He has founded a system, so difficult and burdensome, That it can be carried only by an e1ephant!20 18Demieville, in La Yogiiciirabhumi de Saligharak!fa, includes a long section devoted to the figure of Maitreya; in it he convincingly refutes Maitreya's historicity (1954: 376-387, especially 381 n. 4). 19 Accordingto the Tibetan tradition, these include the Mahiiyiinasutriilaf!Zkiira, the Madhyiintavibhiiga, the Abhisamayiila/!lkiira, the Dharmadharmatiivibhiiga, and the Uttaratantra (Nakamura 1987: 256). 2f'Obermiller's translation of Bu-ston's version (1986: 143), quoted in Wayman 1961: 40. For Taranatha's version, see Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1970: 168."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"15 . Although Bu-ston does not mention the Yo giiciirabhiimi by name, referring only to \"numerous treatises\" (Obermiller 1986: 143), Tiiranat ha says specifically that Vasubandhu \"read the Five Bhiimi-s, the work of iirya Asanga\" (Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1970: 168) . . Incidentally, Wayman, perhaps relying on Taranatha, assumes that Bu­.. ston's version is, in fact, referring to the Yo giiciirabhiimi (1961: 40). Thus, Taranatha unequivocally attributes the authorship of the Yogiiciirabhiimi to Asailga, while Bu-ston seems to contradict himself by first saying that Maitreya expounded it to Asanga and then stating that Asanga composed it himself. In addition to these biographical accounts, we also have traditional attributions in the canonical collections that include the Yo giiciirabhiimi. According to the Ta ishO edition of the Yo giiciirabhiimi, the author is Maitreya (T. 1579: 279a5; Demieville 1978: 134), while according to the index to the Peking edition of the Bstan 'gyur, the author is Asanga. Before I move on, I must again take issue with a statement of Wayman's. According to him, \"There is no disagreement between Chinese �,nd Tibetan tradition as to the common provenance of the Yo giiciirabhiimi, the Abhidharmasamuccaya, and the Ma hiiyiina­sarrtgraha\" (1961: 40). This is just not true. Neither Paramartha nor Hsiian-tsang mentions the Abhidharmasamuccaya or Ma hiiyiina­sarrtgraha, so we must rely on the canonical attributions for the Chinese tradition regarding these works: both texts are attributed to Asailga, with no mention of Maitreya (Demieville 1978: 136). The Tibetan tradition, which unlike the Chinese accepts Asanga as the author of the Yo giiciirabhiimi, agrees with the Chinese in accepting him as the author bf the Abhidharmasamuccaya and the Mahiiyiinasarrzgraha. Therefore, although, as Wayman claims, the Tibetan tradition accepts the common authorship of the three texts, the Chinese tradition certainly does not. In his later work, Wayman in fact mentions the attribution of the Yo giiciirabhiimi to Maitreya in the Chinese canon, and he speculates that \"Hsiian-tsang, believing that Maitreya had inspired Asanga, may have entered the name Maitreya in order to get a hearing for the work, to ensure its study in his country where the Buddhists mainly fo llowed Siitras, such [as] the Pure Land ones, the Avatarrzsaka, the Lotus Siitra,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"16 and so on\" (Wayman 1989: 202). Wayman's reasoning seems to be that, since \"Demieville has sufficiently demonstrated the absurdity of regarding Maitreya as a 'historical personage, \",21 we can safely assume that the story of Asanga's having received the Yo giiciirabhumi from Maitreya is totally fictional and that Asanga wrote the treatise himself. 1 agree with Wayman regarding the question of Maitreya, but 1 think that we must be more open-minded regarding the Chinese tradition that the author of the Yo giiciirabhumi is not the same as the author of the Abhidharma­samuccaya and the Mahiiyiinasa'!'lgraha. Modem scholars have a variety of opinions regarding the authorship of the Yo giiciirabhumi. Some, for example, Willis (1982) and Rahula (1980: xi), simply accept the traditional attribution to Asanga, do not acknowledge that a difference of opinion exists, and therefore make no attempt to justify their acceptance. Others recognize that there is a diff erence of opinion but do not seriously engage the issue. For example, Wayman states that \"it is untenable to hold that certain sections of the Yo giiciirabhumi were written by different persons\" and supports this statement by saying, \"My reading over the years in the Yo giiciirabhumi has led me to conclude that it is the same person writing throughout\" (1989: 201 -202). At the other extreme is Nakamura, who accepts the Chinese attribution to Maitreya or Maitreyanatha and, at the end of two pages of description of the contents of the Yo giiciirabhumi, merely mentions that \"there is an opinion that, as the contents of the Yo giiciirabhumi are substantially different to a great extent from other works ascribed to Maitreya, its author may be different fr om Maitreyanatha\" (Nakamura 1987: 258). Schmithausen, on the other hand, believes that the Yo giiciirabhumi is a compilation (1987: 13) and, responding to Hakamaya, is unwilling to grant much credence to traditional attributions: \"I for one prefer to confine myself to the statement that it is possible (perhaps even probable) that Asanga compiled [the] Y[ogiiciirabhumi] or, as Hakamaya himself puts it in a later article, somehow participated in its compilation 2IWayman 1961: 33, referring to Demieville 1954."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"17 (i.e. that 'tradition' may, in this case, in fact contain a kernel of ..•.. historical truth in our s�nse). But this possibility still needs verification, . and for the time being I for one cannot exclude the opposite possibility\" «1987: 1 85). In fact, in his most recent work on the Yo giiciirabhumi, \" Alayavijiiiina, Schmithausen identifies so many passages from various .· portions of the text that differ so substantially from passages in other ,portions that, to my mind, he has effectively proved his theory that the Yogiiciirabhumi is a heterogeneous compilation that cannot be .•. attributed to Asailga.22 The question of the authorship of the Yo giiciirabhumi is obviously .. pertinent to the study of the Abhidharmasamuccaya, which, to the best of my knowledge, has hitherto been universally accepted (except, perhaps, by Schmithausen) as the work of Asailga. That the Yo giiciira­b.humi chronologically precedes the Abhidharmasamuccaya is also generally, but not universally, conceded; Willis (1982: 10) and Warder (1991: 441), who accept Asailga's authorship of the Yo giiciirabhumi, hoth state that the Abhidharmasamuccaya is earlier without, as Schmithausen points out (1987: 262 n. 100), providing any evidence to support their positions.23 It is indeed difficult to imagine that the same person would have first written the Abhidharmasamuccaya, a model of brevity and organization, and afterwards produced the text to which the TIbetan tradition refers when it criticizes \"Asailga's system\" as being \"so difficult and burdensome that it can be carried only by an elephant\" (Obermiller 1986: 143; see above). Perhaps a better idea of the relationship between the two texts is suggested by Rahula in the introduction to his translation of the rAbhidharmasamuccaya: \"Ce que l' Abhidhammapitaka en piili est pour les Theraviidin, Ie Jii iinaprasthiina pour les Sarviistiviida, Ie 22Schmithausen's bibliography incidentally contains invaluable information about Japanese scholarship on the Yo giiciirabhumi, much of which is discussed in the text of the book. He also reiterates in English some of the points made in his earlier German works, especially Schmithausen 1969 and 1969a. 23 In addition, Schmithausen adduces the fact that the Abhidharmasamuccaya, but not the YogiiciirabhUmi, is familiar with certain doctrines found in the \"Maitreya\" texts as proof that the Abhidharmasamuccaya is later than the Yo giiciirabhumi."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"18 Ma hiiprajiiiipiiramitiisiistra pour les Madhyamika, Ie Yo giiciira­bhumisiisfra l'est pour les Yogacarin\" (Rahula 1980: xiv). Although I disagree with Rahula about the authorship of the Yo giiciirabhumi, I think that his characterization of the text as Yogacara abhidharma, which is similar to Wayman's (1961: 45; see above), is accurate. It is, moreover, significant that Rahula compares the Yo giiciirabhumi with texts belonging to the Theravadin and Sarvastivadin Abhidharmapi!akas proper, rather than with the later treatises. Rahula sets aside his analogy regarding the Yo giiciirabhumi and goes on to compare the question-and­answer format of the Abhidharmasamuccaya with that of certain Pali Abhidhammapi!aka texts, such as the Dhammasmigaf}i, Vibhmiga, and Dhiitukathii. But it must be stressed that if the Yo giiciirabhumi is compared with the Abhidharmapi!akas, the Abhidharmasamuccaya is more properly analogous to the manuals such as the Abhidharmiimrta, which also consists largely of questions and answers similar to those found in the Abhidharmasamuccaya. In any case, the analogy should not be taken too far, since the Abhidharmasamuccaya is a much more sophisticated text than the early Sarvastivada manuals, let alone the works ofthe Pali abhidhamma. C. The Sources of the Exposition of Pratityasamutpiida in the Abhi­dharmasamuccaya As I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the most readily identifiable source of the exposition of pratltyasamutpiida in the Abh idharmasamuccaya is found in the Savitarkiidibhumi of the Yo giiciirabhumi.24 The last eight sections, in particular, of the exposition 24This exposition consists of nine sections, of which the first, entitled sarlra (Yogiiciirabhiimi: 198.1 7-203.5), is also found in the Va sfusa'!lgraha/Jl and is quite different in style from the last eight (Yogiiciirabhiimi: 203.6-232.15), which appear to be later. Schmithausen refers to the sar\"ira section as the \"Pratltyasamutpiida Analysis,\" but he does not seem to comment on the relationship between it and the other eight sections. A verse that appears just before the sarlra section links it to the remainder of the exposition (see note 35). Ui (1958: 279-295 passim) and Matsuda (1983) have noted some of the similarities between the expositions in the Savitarkiidibhiimi and the Abhidharmasamuccaya."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"19 ofpratityasamutpiida in the Savitarkiidibhumi are very abhidharma-like in style. Although the Abhidharmasamuccaya exposition is much shorter, the formats of the two are quite similar, and a number of the same topics are treated in both.25 In general, the Abhidharmasamuccaya, besides being terser, is more systematic than even the latter part of the SavitarkiidibhUmi exposition. Not only does the Abhidharmasamuccaya swnmarize much of the contents of the Savitarkiidibhumi exposition, but it shoWS considerable doctrinal development. This suggests advances in the Yogiidira philosophy that underlies the two texts. Aside from-the Yo giiciirabhumi, the exposition of pratitya­samutpiida in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, has, I believe, another rather surprising source, namely the sixth chapter (A bhimukhibhumi) of the Dasabhumikasutra. In general, the Yo giiciirabhUmi does not refer to Mahayana sutras, the notable exception being the Sarrzdhinirmocana­sutra, which Schmithausen suggests is in fact later than much of the Yo giiciirabhumi, probably including the exposition of pratitya­samutpiida in the Savitarkiidibhumi (1987: 12). The Abhidharma­samuccaya similarly relies on Mahayana sutra sources only rarely, although Schmithausen has identified a passage originating in the Large Prajiiiipiiramitii (1987: 193). However, as I show in the notes to my translation, there are some striking similarities between portions of the Abhidharmasamuccaya pratityasamutpiida exposition and the prose of the Abhimukhibhumi that strongly suggest that the author of the Abhidharmasamuccaya was influenced by the Dasabhumikasutra. ,D. The Ablzidharmakosabhii�ya as Yogacara abhidharma In attempting to establish points of difference between the Yogacara and Sarvastivadin abhidharmas, I have naturally looked first at Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, which, although it is well known not to be an orthodox Sarvastivadin text, clearly analyzes the issues involved in many doctrinal controversies, and which also has the advantage of being thoroughly indexed (Hirakawa 1973-1978) and superbly translated (La Vallee Poussin 1971). Vasubandhu is famous for 2SSee note 35."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"20 generally upholding the Sautrantika position when it differs from Sarvastivada. However, the fact that opinions that he identifies as Sautrantika can often be found in the Yo giiciirabhumi has not been remarked upon until recently. Moreover, in at least several cases, when he does favor Sarvastivada over Sautrantika (or Dar�tantika),z6 the Yo giiciirabhumi position also is in agreement with Sarvastivada. Although nothing can be said conclusively until all of the Sautrantika positions mentioned in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya have been compared with the Yo giiciirabhumi and the Abh idharma­samuccaya, I suspect that Vasubandhu's so-called Sautrantika opinions are, in fact, Yogacara abhidharma in disguise.27 If this is true, it raises questions .about the meaning of the terms Sautrantika and Yogacara as well as about the definition of Mahayana. Currently, a number of Japanese scholars are studying these problems, and I refer to them throughout in my attempt to trace a number of Vasubandhu's positions to their sources in Yogacara abhidharma. 2·Certain commentaries sometimes designate as \"Sautrantika\" positions that originate with Dar�tantika but that are criticized by Vasubandhu. However, Vasubandhu himself does not refer to them as such. Willemen, Desein, and Cox, in discussing the terms Sautrantika and Dar�tantika, observe that Sautrantika is used as a term of approval, while Dar�tantika indicates disapproval (1998: 109). 27Harada, who has been coming to conclusions similar to mine, distinguishes two types of theories that are identified as \"Sautrantika\": positions originating with Dar�tantika that are adopted by Vasubandhu in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya and that can also be found in the Yo giiciirabhumi; and positions that cannot be traced to Dar�tantika but are adopted by Vasubandhu and can also be found in the Yogiiciira­bhumi (1993: 107-1 10). The question remains as to why Vasubandhu, if he fo llows the Yo giiciirabhumi, does not mention iiZayavijiiiina in the Abh idharmakosabhii�ya. Writing about the Vi rpsatikii , Franco in a recent article suggests that those of its features that Schmithausen (1967) has identified as Sautrantika are the result of the fact \"that its opponents are the Sautrantikas. It seems reasonable, therefore, that in trying to make his point, Vasubandhu would argue as much as possible from the Sautrantika presuppositions and that he saw no need to drag the iiZayavijiiiina into the controversy\" (1994: 369-370). I find this explanation of Vasubandhu's method in the Virpsatikii provocative and useful, even though it does not directly account for what he is doing in the Abhidharmako.§abhii�ya."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"21 ll.

The Abhidharmasamuccaya section on artha contains most of the components of the Savitarkiidibhumi section of the same name (Yogiiciirabhumi: 203.12-20), along with several new additions; see note 123. In the Abhidharmasamuccaya, the discussion of pratltyasamutpiida with respect to the conditional operations of the members (angapratyayatvavyavasthiinatah) deals with the same subject as the section in the Savitarkiidibhumi on conditioning (pratyayatva) (Yogiiciirabhumi: 215.1-15). Finally, the contents of the sections in the Abhidharmasamuccaya on the sets of the members (angasamiisataf}) and on the progressive and regressive orders (of defilement and purification-anuloma­pratilomatah) are similar to the contents of the section in the Savitarkiidibhumi on structure (Sarlra) (YogiiciirabhUmi: 198.17-203.5)."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"25 (niri[ha ]pratyayotpattitiim upiidiiya, anityapratyayotpattitiim upiidiiya, samarthapratyayotpattitiim up adaya-26.3-4) A.bhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya 40A This is what the Lord has taught to be the characteristic of conditioned origination: \"Since this exists, that exists\"; \"Due to the 'arising of this, that arises\"; and (bhagavatoktaT!! yat pratitya­s ainutp iidalak�a1}am-asmin safidaT!! bhavati, asyotpiidiid idam �tpadyate / tad uta-31 n. lY6 \"Conditioned by Ignorance, the Kannic Forces37 [exist], etc.\" (avidyiipratyayiiJ;. saT!!skiirii ity evam iidi-31.1) With respect to this: i.

However, as I stated in note 56, I follow the Sanskrit, which seems to make more sense given the context. 58Matsuda (1983: 40) follows the Tibetan translations in reading the Sanskrit tadiik�epakavise�ena (note that Matsuda does not correct a�epakao to a�epaO) as tadii + iik�epakavise�ena (de 'j tshe 'ph en pa'i bye brag-Abhidharmasamuccaya­bhii�ya [tib.]: 24al; Abhidharmasamuccayavyiikhyii [tib.]: 193a3), but the temporal reference does not seem to me to make sense here; I fo llow Hsiian-tsang's Chinese, where :fBi (tad = tasya) refers back to Ignorance, which Hsiian-tsang seems to have supplied in order to clarify the passage ('i�taQ-m�:m1T���g51�;:t&o ���ra' �o EI3 1Bi5 1#;�jJU��1TViE*,i'§ti1:t&-T. 1606: 711c14-16). 59In his edition, Tatia breaks the sentence after tatkiilasamudiiciiril:Zl; however, this seems to be a mistake.

The Arthaviniscayasutranibandhana comments on another version of the sutra, which contains another stage, not included in our version, namely, upapatti. According to the Arthaviniscayasutranibandhana, sa\",jiiti is the completion of niimariipa, while upapatti is the obtaining of the remainder of the body on the part of the completed niimariipa (sa\",purIJaniimariipasya visi�takiiyiivasthii­priiptir upapattil]-Arthaviniscayasutranibandhana: 148.2). Thus, sa\",jiiti in the Savitarkiidibhumi is equivalent to sa\",jiiti and upapatti, taken together, in the ArthaviniScayasutranibandhana (148.3). 1112Bhattacharya gives bhavakriinti, wh.ich, again, is clearly an error; the Arthaviniscayasutranibandhana (148.3) gives avakriinti. 103 Again, the antecedent is unclear; avakriinti usually refers to the descent into the womb, i.e., conception (see Monier-Williams 1970: 97), but here, it clearly refers to a later stage in the process of birth. lI14abhinirvrtti according to the Arthaviniscayasutranibandhana (148.4).

According to the Arthaviniscayasutranibandhana, the term skandha here means \"mass\" (riisi; both the editor and Honjo [ 1989: 85] refer to Abhidharmakosa I 10ab).

Before attempting to explain this definition, I shall provide some other interpretations of the term dhiitupratilambha: According to the Paryiiyasaf!1grahar;i, dhiitupratilambha is the obtainment of the seeds of those (skandhas) in this [niimarnpa] state (khams riied pa iiid du de 'i sa bon riied pa 'o-Paryiiyasaf!1grahar;i [tib.]: 48b I; 5'f.l.lj.o !!p£a�.rtt flLCP1Blf!Tl.lj..-T. 1579: 769a15). According to the Arthaviniscayasutranibandhana, the term dhiitu here refers to that which is empty in that it is nothing more than dharmas. Therefore, this is taught to refute the notion that the body is the self (dharmamiitraf!1 tucchaf!1 dhiitur iti nirvacaniit dhiitugrahar;af!1 dehyiitmakalpaniivyudiisiirtham-149.5-6). The Yii ch'ie lun chi f�{b!I8nli�c explains dhiitupratilambha together with skandhapratilambha, in terms of seeds: \"The obtainment of the skandhas is the arising of the actuality of the skandhas. The obtainment of the dhiitus is the nature of the seeds of the skandhas to act as the causal condition of the skandhas. The obtainment of the skandhas is the ripening of that which is currently existing. The obtainment of the dhiitus is the ripening of seeds. The obtainment of the iiy atanas is the ripening of the other three conditions through both that which is currently existing and seeds: fil.lj.��fi:;tj@o 5'f.1.lj.�l'ififiTfi[l;J *�'tlo fi1.lj. :fJl. :jT!lX:�-!\\o mjHiT!lX:�o �lUHfl.fio fi::::: �}jM-!\\ (T. 1828: 368c16-19). But I suspect that this explanation reads too much later Y ogacara philosophy into the text. The above three interpretations of the term· dhiitupratilambha all differ, and what the Savitarkiidibhumi says is not very clear, but perhaps the meaning is something like this: after the initial arising of the skandhas, those skandhas reproduce themselves fr om one moment to the next by acting as the hetupratyaya for their next moment of existence (in this case, hetupratyaya, bija, and dhiitu are essentially synonymous; for this meaning of dhiitu, see Yamabe I 997a, 1997b).

Profundity Abhidharmasamuccaya How [should that which has originated conditionally be understood] with reference to its profundity? Its profundity is to be understood in terms of (a) the profundity of cause (hetugiimbhirya); (b) the profundity of characteristics (lak$aIJagiimbhlrya); (c) the profundity of arising (utpattigiimbhlrya); (d) the profundity of continued existence (sthitigiimbhlrya); (e) the profundity of progression (vrttigiimbhlrya).125 1Z3There seems to be a correspondence between pratiniyatahetuphaliirtha and one of the six modes of bija mentioned in the Mahiiyiinasalpgraha (see Chapter 6, section A). According to the Mahiiyiinasalpgrahabhii�ya, \"lis [bijas] sont les auteurs d'un fr uit propre: tin gerrne donne produit seulement Ie fruit qui lui est propre. Ainsi, la connaissance-receptacle produit seulement la connaissance-receptacle, et Ie ble produit seulement Ie fruit du ble\" (Lamotte 1973 : 40-41). Although our text does not mention iilayavijiiiina or bija, it describes the same causal principle, namely that the result is essentially homogenous with the cause. 12'Some of these arthas call to mind the definitions of certain of the c\"ittaviprayuktasaTrzskiiras in the Abhidharrnasarnuccaya (Pradhan 1950: 11.16-24; Abhidharrnasarnuccayabhii�ya: 9.7-1 1 .8): specifically, hetuphalaprabandhiinupa­cchediirtha seems to correspond to pravrtti; vicitrahetuphaliirtha and pratiniyata­hetuphaliirtha seem related to pratiniyarna; anurilp ahetuphaliirtha corresponds to yoga; and �w:zikiirtha perhaps is related to java. [ examine the relationship between the group of cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras pertaining to cause and effect and pratftyasarnutpiida in Chapter Six. 125The Sanskrit text of the Abhidharrnasarnuccayabhii�ya gives pravrtti instead of vrtti, but there is no difference between the Chinese texts of the Abhidharrna­sarnuccaya and Abhidharrnasarnuccayavyiikhyii, which both give *\" or among the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"58 (kathaTflgiimbhlryata� / hetugiimbhlryato 'pi, la�arJagiimbhlryato 'pi, utpattigiimbhlryato 'pi, sthitigiimbhlryato 'pi, vrttigiimbhlryato 'pi giimbhlryaTfl dra,ytavyam-26.25-27)'26 Abhidharmasamuccayabha�ya 40H (1) .

(c) Profundity of arising [is to be understood] by means of two imports [i.e., paratantrartha and nirlhakiirtha] because of the fact that, even though results arise due to conditions, they are not [really] manufactured by them. (d) Profundity of continued existence [is to be understood] by means Tibetan texts of the Abhidharmasamuccaya, Abhidh armasamuccayabhii$ya, and Abhidharmasamuccayavyiikhyii, which all give 'byun bas. Although I hesitate to correct the Sanskrit text of the Abhidharmasamuccaya here, I translate vrtti as though it were equivalent to pravrtti. In any case, the two words share much of the same meaning.

Tw o Lifetimes or Three? In order to understand the pratityasamutpiida formula more than superficially, it is necessary, as Takasaki has pointed out (1987: 151), to investigate the relationships among the various members, as well as the meanings of the individual members. The section on angasamiisa in the Abhidharmasamuccaya is just such an investigation, and its fo urfold division of the members is one of the most striking features of its discussion of conditioned origination. In this section, the principle of conditioned origination is applied to the cycle of rebirth, and the twelve members are divided into four grOUpS according to their roles in the rebirth process. Since this division is only one of a number of such divisions proposed by Buddhist thinkers, we must compare it with other interpretations, especially those of the Sarvastivada, whose abhidharma the Abhidharmasamuccaya often seems to supersede. One division particularly helpful for an understanding of the relationship among the members can be fo und, among other places, in the Vibhii�ii and in Vasubandhu's exposition of Sarvastivadin doctrine in the Abhidharmakosa. In this grouping, members of the formula are not explicitly assigned positions in the cycle; rather they are grouped according to their essential nature. As we shall see, this is a preliminary step toward establishing their positions. According to this division, there are three groups: (1) Ignorance, Subconscious Desire, and Appropriation are of the nature of defilement (klda); (2) the Karmic Forces and Karmic Existence are of the nature of karma; (3) Consciousness, Individual Existence, the Six Senses, Contact, Feeling, Birth, and Old Age and Death are of the nature of substance (vastu)156 or result '56Yasubandhu explains this as being due to the fact that they are the support of klesa and karma (klesakarmasrayatvat---cAbhidharmakosabha�y a: 134. 12)."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"68 (phala).157 Therefore, the first two groups are, in essence, cause.­However, klesa cannot produce result immediately; the mediation of karma is necessary.158 Thus, karma, which in Sarvastivada, but not in IS7Abhidharmakosa III 26;Abhidharmakosabhii�a: 134.3-15; see also La Vallee Poussin 1913: 34-36. In a note to his translation of the Abhidharmakosa, La ValIee Poussin states, \"Dans toutes les autres sources, Ie troisieme vartman est seulement defini comme retribution (vipiika) [ou fr uit, phala]\" (La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 68 n. 2). Unfortunately, he does not specify what alI these other sources are. As far as I have discovered, the earlier abhidharma texts do not, in fact, define the third vartman as vipiika or phala. The Vi bhii�ii simply states that the three divisions are klesa, karma, and vastu (=5J\":lfo �ltJ:l[tiM�$- T. 1545: 122b I2), and it mentions the opinion of another teacher that the members can be gathered into three groups: klesa, karma, and dul;kha (x.-t=::L lJI � =�o �HIf&lIIH�f-T. 1545: 122 bI5-16). The Abhidharmiimrta caIls the third division dul;kha (T. 1553: 970c27; Sastri 1953: 70.5; Van den Broeck 1977: 131). The Chinese translation of Dharmasri's Abhidharmahrdaya uses the character ft, which is probably a translation of vastu (T. 1550: 826c26; Willemen 1975: 129), while ., the more common translation of va stu, is fo und in both UpaSanta's Abhidharmahrdaya (T. 1551: 860c1) and the SaTflyuktiibhidharmahrdaya (T. 1552: 935b 18). None ofthese texts mentions vipiika or phala. On the other hand, the Visuddhimagga, as La Vallee Poussin mentions in the same note, also contains three divisions, the third of which is calIed vipiikava!!a; what he does not mention, however, is that jiiti and jariimaraIJa are not included (sankhiira­bhavii kammava!!aTfl, avijjii-taIJhupiidiiniini kilesava!!aTfl, viiiiiiiIJa-niimarupa­saiiiyatana-phassa-vedanii vipiikava!!an ti-498.7-9) because they comprise viiiiiiiIJa, etc. (Ayatim phalapaiicakan ti viiiiiiiIJiidfni paiica. Tiini jiitigahaIJena vuttiini. Ja riimaraIJaTfl pana tesaTfl yeva jariimaraIJaTfl-498.1-2). None of the commentators whom I have been able to consult (Yasomitra, Sarp.ghabhadra, P'u-kuang ttJ't, and Fa-pao i*1t) remarks upon Vasubandhu's application of the term phala to the members included in vastu. Of course, in the three­lifetimes/ twofold causation system of Sarvastivada, discussed below, it makes sense to calI these members \"result,\" since vijiiiina, etc., are the result of past avidyii and saTflskiira, while jiiti and jariimaraIJa are the result of present tr�IJii, up iidiina, and bhava. Conversely, in the two-lifetimes/singlefold system, it does not make sense to call vijniina (niimaropa in the Abhidharmasamuccaya), etc., \"result,\" since they are seeds; only when they are actualized as jiiti and jariimaraIJa can they be calIed phala (see section C2 of this chapter). • UsualIy, when Vasubandhu changes or adds to what is said in the Vibhii�ii and Abhidharmahrdaya, there is some significance, but in this case I cannot figure out what it is. 'SHkleiiit karma / up iidiiniit bhavo 'vidyiiyiis ca saTflskiiriil; (A bhidharmakosa­bhii�ya: 134.26-135.1; La ValIee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 68)."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"69 other schoQls, has a physical as well as a mental component,159 enables the purely mental state of defilement to have a tangible consequence, namely rebirth, which consists of both mental and physical factors. The last group is result, which in tum comprises two subsets of consecutive members, one consisting of Consciousness through Feeling, the other of Birth and Old Age and Death. These two subsets correspond to the projected and actualized sets of members in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, with the exception of Consciousness, the causal aspect of which the Abhidharmasamuccaya emphasizes by including it in the projecting set. This placement of Consciousness is in contrast to not only Sarvastiviida, which considers vijiiiina in the pratztyasamutpiida formula to be pratisarrzdhivijiiiina and thus purely fiuitional, but also the Ch 'eng wei shih fun, which includes vijiiiina in the group of projected members on the grounds that it refers to the seeds projected from the previous life that are the cause of iifayavijiiiina. 160 Next we come to divisions of members according to their position in the rebirth cycle. Concerning the number of lifetimes needed to complete one cycle of causation, beginning with Ignorance and ending with Old Age and Death, there are two major schools of thought. The first, presented by Va subandhu as the orthodox Sarviistiviidin position and indeed fo und in the Vibhii�iil61 and in the Abhidharmiimrta, 162 requires three lifetimes and two rounds of causation.163 This system can '''See, for example, the definition of lciiyavijiiapti in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: cittavasena kiiyasyatathii tathii sa1Jlstl;iinarrz kiiyavijiiaptil; (192.24; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 3: 4). Avijiiaptiriipa, too, although not exactly material, is nevertheless riipa, and, as P.S.

First of all, by mentioning three lifetimes, it answers the commonsensical questions of how we arrived in this lifetime in the fIrst place, and what will become of us in the next life. Furthermore, it suits 164 Abhidharmakosa II [ 20; Abhidharmakosabhiirya: 131.3-1 1. 165It can be seen for example in the Pilli tradition in the Visuddhimagga: Atlta­paeeuppanniiniigatii e 'assa tavo kiilii.

Finally it is simple, at least superficially, since it does not disturb the order of the members; thus, it lends itself to pictorial representation in the outer ring of the wheel of life (bhavacakra, Tibetan srid pa 'i 'khor 10) familiar to us from Tibetan painting. 166 The second way of distributing the members into lifetimes requires only two lifetimes and one round of causation.167 According to this system, or at least to the version presented in the Abhidharmasamuccaya and Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya, the causal members, which constitute the projecting set of members (Ignorance, the Karmic Forces, and Consciousness) and the actualizing set (Subconscious Desire, Appropriation, and Karmic Existence), belong to one life. The resultant members, which constitute the projected set (Individual Existence, the Six Senses, Contact, and Feeling) and the actualized set (Birth and Old Age and Death), belong to the next life. Thus, all the causal members are assigned to the earlier lifetime, and all the resultant members to the later. This system is generally recognized as being associated with the Yo gacara school although Matsuda, fo llowing Yamaguchi's conclusions regarding the KarmasiddhiprakaralJa, seems to fe el that it is more properly classified as Hinayana and hence connected to the Sautrantika school (1982a: 48). Although the Abhidharmasamuccaya never says so explicitly, its scheme can equally well explain birth from the past life into the present and from the present life into the future.168 If I understand Matsuda correctly, he believes that the treatment in the Abhidharmasamuccaya is the earliest example of the \"two­lifetimes/singlefold\" theory of causation (1982a: 48). However, this very terse arrangement of the members of the formula, which cannot be understood without reference to the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya, does 166For a list of the constituents of each of the four rings, see the large Tibetan­Chinese dictionary (Bod rgya tshig rndzod chen rna: 2976-2977). 167liang shih i ch 'ung iifiii!!: -;i:. 168For a sixth-century Chinese discussion of this question in particular and a summary of various divisions of the pratltyasarnutpiida fo rmula over numbers of lifetimes, see the Ta ch 'eng i cheng **�ft. of Ch 'ing-ying Hui-yiian W��j!

Moreover, it closely matches what is said, although in a non-schematic way, in the section on pratztyasamutpiidasar'ira in the exposition of prat'ityasamutpiida found in the Savitarkiidibhumi of the Yo giiciira­bhumi.169 In order to trace the development of the two-lifetimes! singlefold causation theory, I shall provide translations of the relevant portions of the two texts mentioned above and try to show how they lead to the system in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, which I think is the most fully developed version. B. From the Sixth Stage of the Dasabhumikasutra 1. Concerning the Text The textual history of the Dasabhumikasutra is very complex. In the case of the brief portion of the sixth stage dealing with the lifetimes with which the members of the prat'ityasamutpiida formula are associated, the discrepancies among the Chinese and Tibetan translations and the extant Sanskrit version are strikingly numerous. Among these variants one can distinguish two basic textual traditions, the difference between which, I believe, reflects developments in Yogacara thought. Although my conclusions, based on such a small excerpt from the text, are highly speculative, I think that the earlier of the two traditions may have been a source for the ideas fo und in the Yo giiciirabhumi and Abhidharma­samuccaya, while the later tradition seems to have been influenced by the fully developed two-lifetimes!singlefold causation theory. 170 I have consulted ten different versions of the text of tp e '69The contents of this section are also fo und in the Va stusarrzgrahalJl.

The first version explicitly includes Birth and Old Age and Death in the group of members pertaining to the future life, while the second version omits them or separates them in some way fr om this group. Furthermore, the final sentence of the first version seems to state straightforwardly that the twelve members are to be assigned to three lifetimes, while the last sentence of the second version implies that Birth and Old Age and Death do not belong to the same lifetime as Subconscious Desire, Appropriation, and Karmic Existence. If we next compare the first version to the Sarvastivadin three­lifetimes/twofold causation system, we can see that the distribution of members in the present and future lives is quite different.

I am grateful to Matsuda Kazunobu for informing me of two old Nepalese manuscripts of the Dasabhiimikasiitra:, belonging to the Cecil Bendall Manuscript Collection in the National Archives in Kathmandu, and for transcribing the relevant portions. These manuscripts are not reflected in the Kondo or Rahder editions. Bendall uses one of them in his edition of the Siksiisamuccaya, and he claims that it dates from the sixth century, which seems exce�dingly early (Sik�iisamuccaya: 2 91). This manuscript unfortunately lacks much of our passage, and it is impossible to even know whether it corresponds with the first or the second version. The reading from the other manuscript is substantially identical to Kondo's.

In the first version of the Dasabhumikasutra, however, those members that Sarvastivada considers the cause of the future life are themselves included in the future life. At first glance, this seems strange, since as a rule in both Sarvastivadin and Yogacara discussions of pratityasamutpiida, causal members and resultant members are associated with different lifetimes. However, as Ito has observed, the exposition of pratityasamutpiida in the Dasabhumikasutra contains a mixture of abhidharma-like precision and undifferentiated, undeveloped formulations (1988: 718). In the discussion of lifetimes, the grouping of the causes of the future life together with the future life itself suggests that our passage is an example of non-abhidharma-like imprecision. Thus, when the Dasabhumikasutra relates the members to the various lifetimes, we need not assume as rigid an association as is found, for example, in the Abhidharmakosa. Nor, in fact, must we understand past, present, and future tq be absolute concepts. As we shall see below, the commentary on this passage shows the relative nature of the three times. In terms of the development of the two-lifetimes/singlefold causation system, in the first version ·of the Dasabhumikasutra, the members from Ignorance through Feeling are grouped in the same way as in the Abhidharmasamuccaya arrangement (with the exception of Consciousness), while the members from Subconscious Desire through Karmic Existence no longer share the present life with the members from Consciousness through Feeling. Thus, if we look only at the past and present lives, we can see a fully completed round of causation: Ignorance and the Karmic Forces in the past are the cause of the present life; which consists of Consciousness, Individual Existence, the Six Senses, Contact, and Feeling. Here there are no remaining members that require fruition in a third lifetime, as do Subconscious Desire, Appropriation, and Karmic Existence in the Sarvastivada system. If we use the terminology of the Abhidharmasamuccaya to describe the arrangement in the first version of the Dasabhumikasutra, the projecting and projected groups of members are in place, again except for"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"77 Consciousness, which here belongs to the present life and must be considered part of the-projected group (for more discussion of the ambiguous position of Consciousness, see below). The actualizing and actualized members, on the other hand, are both mentioned-with reference to the future life. No other texts that I have consulted, whether Sarviistiviidin or Yogiiciira, include these members in the same life, nor does the Dasabhumikasutra discuss its own arrangement, and I do not see how the location of Subconscious Desire, Appropriation, and Karmic Existence in the future can be justified. 4. Concerning the Commentary on the Dasabhumikasutra It is difficult to establish which version of the root text the author of the commentary actually used and what exactly he said about it, because there is considerable discrepancy between the Chinese and Tibetan translations of this text, of which no Sanskrit manuscript is extant. Ito remarks that the Tibetan translation is more easily understood than the Chinese (1988: 99), and this observation is certainly valid regarding the passage under discussion. The two versions differ most markedly concerning the root text as presented in the beginning of the section, that is, before the comment- begins, and as quoted in the comment. The versions of the comment itself, on the other hand, have only one meaningful difference; this is found in the discussion of the present life. I am unable to establish which of the two translations is more faithful to the original, so I refer to the Tibetan since it makes more sense. However, I provide translations of both versions. 5.

Analysis of the Comment193 The comments on the past lifetime are particularly interesting in that they point out the relative nature of the three times. According to this interpretation, the past life in the context of the prafityasamutpiida formula is the time of cause. Thus, if we take any three successive lifetimes, Lifetime One is the past life with respect to, and hence the cause of, Lifetime Two. Lifetime Two is the past life with respect to, and hen�e the cause of, Lifetime Three. The logical conclusion, and the point that I think the commentator is making, is that it would be better to talk of the antecedent lifetime and the ensuing lifetime, in this way reducing the three lifetimes to two. Incidentally, according to the 1'I2�Bo 411;aJHifif!p;lU,i/.il$j!!: *#n �l:E��;��f'F�o � 1H1�,f!D�'i*T!lD�� ��.��o�b��.�.l:Et.*n ��.�.M� ••• M.l:E� ••• o.� 1�** •• o fJ�;(L!FJi**t.t\"n 1£��-ttJE�o a1'£:��=.g*n 1£�f&� $$� (T, 1522: 170aI7-23). 193 As I mentioned above, I rely on the Tibetan translation in my discussion of the comment."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"81 ShindojOyuishikiron, two of the commentaries on the Ch 'eng wei shih lun seem to make the same point. 194 In his discussion of the members that the Dasabhumikasutra assigns to the future life, the commentator in fact does not mention past, present, or future by name; he simply refers to a subsequent existence. He states that Subconscious Desire, Appropriation,and Karmic Existence cause the production of a new existence, and he implies (or at least I infer) that this new existence is equivalent to the members, Birth and Old Age and Death. In this case, the comment only makes sense in the context of the second version of the DasabhUmikasutra passage (the version quoted within the comment), in which the last two members are not grouped with the previous three; if all five members from Subconscious Desire through Old Age and Death belonged to the same lifetime (as they do in the Chinese, but not in the Tibetan, translation of the root text), the causal relationship that the commentator attributes to them would be impossible. Thus, the second version of the Dasabhumikasutra passage, especially as interpreted in the commentary, is yet another step closer to the fully developed Yogacara two-lifetimes/singlefold causation theory. The members that comprise the actualizing and actualized groups are now assigned to different lifetimes and so· can assume a relationship of cause and result. Moreover, the real status of the future lifetime h�s been somewhat undermined. It is true that, at this point, the lifetimes to which the actualizing and actualized groups of members belong is not yet clear. However, the second version, far more than the first, can support an interpretation consistent with .the two-lifetimes theory. This fact suggests to me that the text was altered for doctrinal reasons either shortly before the commentary was written or under its influence. 194\"The past [consists of] the ten causal members; the present [consists of] the two resultant [members].

General Remarks Concerning the Sarira Section When we look at the .section on the structure (sarira) of conditioned origination in the Savitarkiidibhumi of the Ma ulibhumi,195 we find that the members of the formula are arranged in similar, although not precisely the same, groups as in the A[Jhidharmasamuccaya, and we also have an explanation of the logic underlying this grouping. Matsuda disagrees with Ui, whom he quotes as saying that the sarira section contains neither a three-lifetimes/twofold causation theory nor a two­lifetimes/singlefold theory. Referring to another, more or less parallel passage in the SriivakabhUmi, Matsuda maintains that the passages in the Yo giiciirabhumi do, in fact, express a two-lifetimes/singlefold causation theory, while at the same time he points out that the sarira section is quite difficult to understand (1983: 30-32). Although the ideas found there are somewhat disorganized, I shall attempt to show their relationship to the more systematized presentation in the Abhidharmasamuccaya.196 195The sarfra portion only of the Savitarkiidibhftmi (Yogiiciirahhftmi: 198.17-203.5; Maulfbhftmi [tib.]: zi 115 a3-118b3; T. 1579: 321a1 7-322aI8) is parallel to the first portion of the Va stusalflgrahar:zi exposition of pratftyasamutpiida (Vastusalflgrahar:zf [tib.]: 'i 285a3-287b6; T. 1579: 827c3-828c I2). 19·5imilar ideas can be found in the Bodhisattvabhftmi in a discussion often types of causes (hetu), among which iik�epahetu is defined as fo llows: avidyiidfniilfl dharmiiniim dr�ta eva dharme yiini bijiini jiitasya bhfttasyeha I tiiny anyajiinmikasya jiitijariimarar:zasyii�epahetu� (Bodhisattvabhftmi: 100.13-15; T. 1579: 501 c17 -19); the entire discussion of the ten types of causes, which includes an extensive explanation of bija causality in botanical terms, as well as a definition of abhin irvrttihetu (Bodhisattvabhftmi: 99.9-1 00.10; T. 1579: 501 b 18-c 11), deserves further study. The SavitarkiidibhUmi also contains a discussion of ten types of causes in which iik�epahetu and abhin irvrttihetu are defined (Yogiiciirabhftmi: 106ff; T. 1579: 301b9 ff.).

The projecting cause consists of Ignorance, the Karmic Forces, and Consciousness in the present life, together with the seeds of Consciousness (in the form of the six vijiiiinakiiyas), Individual Existence, the Six Senses, Contact, and Feeling in the future. The cause that actualizes rebirth consists of Subconscious Desire, Appropriation, and Karmic Existence in the present life. The above passage does not designate the result of these causes, but the later section on pratyaya does: \"How many members are included in the proj ecting cause? [The members] from Ignorance through Feeling. How many members are included in the cause that actualizes rebirth? [The members] from Subconscious Desire through Karmic Existence.

In this way, the discussion of the pratztyasamutpiida formula in the Savitarkiidibhumi represents a theory of causation based o.n seeds. In brief, the causal consciousness in this lifetime contains the seeds of rebirth in the next lifetime. The cause that actualizes rebirth, namely Subconscious Desire, Appropriation, and Karmic Existence in this lifetime, makes the seeds of rebirth yield results, thereby producing rebirth in the future. 209 Readers who are familiar with the fully developed, two-layered structure of consciousness fo und in \"classical\" Yogacara texts such as the Tr irrzsikiibhii�ya may [m d the descriptions of consciousness in this exposition of pratztyasamutpiida a bit strange. Most strikingly, there is no discussion of how this consciousness operates in cognition. Nor is there any mention of its object or of a continuous stream of an underlying consciousness generally accompanied by one of the regular sense-consciousnesses. To some extent, this passage is similar to other expositions of pratztyasamutpiida, in which the mechanism of cognition is far less· important than the implications of cognition in perpetuating the cycle of klda, karma, and vastu (or du�kha). Not even in a text like the Ch ' eng wei shih lun, in which the doctrine of vijiiaptimiitra is fully developed and cognition is explained in detail, can we find a mention of the cognitive function of vijiiiina in statements about vijiiiiniinga. Furthermore, it is important to remember that consciousness in the Savitarkiidibhumi sarzra portion, although clearly different fr om consciousness in, for example, Sarvastivadin interpretations of the pratztyasamutpiida formula, is not called iilayavijiiiina nor is it described in a way that clearly suggests that it is iilayavijiiiina.

Therefore, when we read in the Yo giiciirabhumi about consciousness in the pratftyasamufpiida formula, we should not expect to find an exposition of iilayavijiiiina.

Furthermore, the Ch 'eng wei shih [un points out that the term Consciousness here refers to the causal aspect of vijiiiina, i.e., the karmabijas,211 while the seeds of the vipiikavijiiiina (i.e., the vijiiiinabijas; 21'1 have not, in fact, discovered any occurrences of this tenn in Sanskrit texts.

Cox, who also cites the occurrence in the Sriivakabhumi, notes that the tenn is very uncommon in abhidharma texts (1995: 373 n. 142). According to the Trirrciikiibhii$ya, karmaviisanii refers to the power, deposited in the iilayavijiiiina by mental kanna, to actualize a future existence (pu1',lyiipu1',lyii­neiijyacetanii karma / tena karma1',lii yad aniigatiitmabhiiviibhinirvrttaye (emended fr om iinagatiitmaO) iilayavijiiiine siimarthyam iihita1!l / sii karmaviisanii-Tri1!lsikii­bhii$ya: 36.23-24).

The Abhidharmasamuccaya refmes the Yo giiciirabhumi system by further analyzing the projecting cause into sets of projecting and projected members, thereby assigning the seeds of Individual Existence, etc., to the next lifetime, where they are a potentiality waiting to be actualized. Thus, the treatment of angasamiisa is typical of the method in much of the Abhidharmasamuccaya. Without even mentioning bija, let alone iilayavijiiiina, it systematizes ideas fo und in the Yo giiciirabhumi and perhaps in the Dasabhumikasutra in order to formulate an abhidharma that is consistent with bija and iilayavijiiiina theory. In this case, the Abhidharmasamuccaya is so effective that its exposition is incorporated, with only slight changes, into the Ch 'eng wei shih lun, a text that of course explicitly propounds the doctrine of iilayavijiiiina. between the different categories of viisaniis or bijas is often missing or at least not easily recognizable\" (1987: 343 n. 448) and that the seeds of future iitmabhiivas can \"hardly be dissociated from the Impressions ofkarman\" (1987: 428 n. 83 1).

THE FUNCTIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS A. Introduction In this chapter, I discuss the functions of some of the individual members of the pratityasamutpiida fo rmula as described in the fifth section (angakarmavyavasthiina) of our exposition. My approach in each case is somewhat different, and the discussions vary in length as I examine a number of doctrinal issues raised by the very terse explanations. In order to clarify these issues, I have had to look at a rather large number of other sources. While the Abhidharmasamuccaya and Abhidharmasamuccaya­bhii�ya are the only extant works that both are openly attributed to Yo gacara and include the word abhidharma in their titles, the contents of large portions of other Yogacara texts, most notably the Yo giiciirabhumi, can certainly be characterized as abhidharma. Furthermore, in my opinion Vasubandhu in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya on at least some occasions adopts a position in agreement with the Yo giiciirabhumi rather than with orthodox Sarvastivadin abhidharma. Other texts attributed to Vasubandhu, such as the Pratityasamutpiidavyiikhyii and the Paiicaskandhaka , more obviously not written from a Sarvastivadin viewpoint, are clearly relevant to the study of the Abhidharma­samuccaya . In addition, in order to understand the divergence between Yo gacara and Sarvastivada, it is often necessary to trace the development of a concept within the Sarvastivadin abhidharma literature and sometimes even further back, to the Ag amas. Therefore, in this chapter I frequently refer to a large body of siistras, including works associated with both Yogacara and Sarvastivada. More surprisingly, a passage from the DasabhUmikasutra is directly relevant here, as can be seen fr om my translation in Chapter Two. In general, the Abhidharmasamuccaya, like the Yo giiciirahhumi, neither quotes from nor refers to Ma hiiyiina sutras, but the fo rmat of our fifth section is strikingly similar to that of the Dasabhumikasutrapassage."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"94 B. Concerning the Two Parallel Passages According to the section in the Abhidharmasamuccaya on the establishment of the functions of the members of the pratltyasamutpiida fo rmula (angakarmavyavasthiina), each member, with the ex�eption of jariimara1}a, has two functions, the second of which is to act as the condition of the fo llowing member. Matsuda (1983: 49 n. 28) mentions that this section corresponds to the vibhanga section of the discussion in Savitarkiidibhumi, which he identifies as a commentary on the Prcitztya­samutpiidiidivibhiiganirddasutra fo und in the Sa7!lyuktiigama.212 In my . discussion, I examine both the section on vibhanga in the Savitarkiidibhumi and another possible source for the Abhidharma­samuccaya, the section fr om the Dasabhumikasutra that I have included in the notes to my translation. Another relevant text is Vasubandhu's Prat'ityasamutpiidavyiikhyii, which quotes the entire text of the Savitarkiidibhumi treatment of avidyiinga and often corresponds to the discussions of angakarmavyavasthiina in the Abhidharmasamuccaya and Abh idharm asamuccayabhii�ya (1983: 47 n. 11,49 n. 28). Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to read the PratZtya­samutpiidavyiikhyii, except very partially. For this reason, I only occasionally refer to this very important text, which, although it is later than the Abh idharmasamuccaya, may help us understand the philosophical underpinnings of the abhidharma system of the Abhidharmasamuccaya. Before I discuss a number of the individual members in detail, I shall make a fe w very general comments on what I consider to be the relationship between the discussions in the SavitarkiidibhUmi and the Dasabhumikasutra and those in the Abh idharmasamuccaya and Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya. The Savitarkiidibhumi vibhanga section 212T. 99 (no. 298): 85a-b. The discussion in the Savitarkiidibhumi in some cases seems to match more closely the version of the sutra as translated by Hsiian-tsang (T .. 124: 547b-548a) than the version in the Sa7!lyuktiigama, to which Matsuda mentions it corresponds (1 Q82a: 43). However, I cannot here address the question of the exact source of the Savitarkiidibhumi discussion."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"95 is, to a large extent, a rather straightforward commentary on the Prafityasamutpiidiidivibhiiganirde.sasutra, and its discussions of the first two (Ignorance and the Karmic Forces) and the last five members (Subconscious Desire, Appropriation, Karmic Existence, Birth, arid Old Age and Death) of the formula seem unremarkable from a doctrinal point of view. However, as Schmithausen has noted,213 the discussion of the members from Consciousness through Feeling presents a theory of causation by seeds; to my mind, this indicates that it is a Yo gadira interpretation, albeit an early or \"primitive\" one. The discussion in the Dasabhumikasutra, on the other hand, does not contain any terms such as bija that are specifically associated with Yo gacara doctrine. The form of the discussion, however, is nearly identical to that of the Abhidharmasamuccaya. Each member is first defined in terms of its own activity and then in terms of its function as the condition of the following member. Outside of these two texts, I have not seen a discussion similar in form, with the possible exception of the Savitarkiidibhumi discussion of Consciousness through Feeling, in which each member seems to be at once itself and the seed of itself produced by the preceding member. I believe that it is possible that the Abhidharmasamuccaya adopted the form of the Dasabhumikasutra discussion in order to emphasize that not only the function of each member, but also the precise relationship between one member and another, is important for an understanding of conditioned origination. The Abhidharmasamuccaya only mentions and does not explain the second function of each member, with the crucial exception of the Karmic Forces, which it specifies as being the condition of the impressions contained in Consciousness.214 The comments of the Bhii�a, however, clarify the nature of each relationship. In this chapter, I shall discuss Ignorance, the Karmic Forces, Individual Existence, Feeling, the Six Senses, Contact, and Subconscious Desire. The functions of vijiiiina will be the subject of the next chapter. 2J3(I 987: 78). See Chapter 2, section 85c. 2.14See Chapter 2, section 85b."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"96 C. Discussion of Individual Members 1. Ignorance According to the Abhidharmasamuccaya, the first function of Ignorance is to delude beings concerning existence. This seems to be a fairly straightforward summary of the definition found in the Pratltyasamutpiidasutra, which consists of a long list of different types of Ignorance regarding various aspects of existence. The Abhidharma­samuccayabhii$ya certainly understands it this way; it supplies from the vibhafzga section of the Savitarkiidibhumi the examples of Ignorance regarding past, future, and present lives in order to show that delusion regarding existence consists of the various types of Ignorance mentioned in the sutra and that each of these types should be understood according to the explanations in Savitarkiidibhumi. A related explanation of the nature of Ignorance can be found in the Abhidharmakosabhii$ya, in a passage in which Vasubandhu gives his own, as opposed to the orthodox Vaibha�ika, explanation of pratftyasamutpiida: \"an ignorant person, not understanding that what originates conditionally is merely the conditioning factors ... \"215 Ya somitra explains that \"merely the conditioning factors\" refers to the non-existence of a self.216 Here, Vasubandhu seems to have chosen for the purpose of summarizing Ignorance another of the types of Ignorance mentioned by the sutra, adhyiitmam aj iiiinam, which is explained as follows by the Savitarkiidibhumi: \"What is internal ignorance? It is the ignorance of one who improperly considers his conditioning factors to be a self.,,217 This discussion of pratftya­samutpiida in the Abhidharmakosabhii$ya218 generally follows the 215biilo hi pratityasamutpannarrt sarrtskiiramiitram idam ity ap rajiinan (Abhidharmakosabhiirya: 139.25-26; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 84). 2 16miitragraha1J,am iitmaprati�edhiirtham (Abhidharmakosavyiikhyii: 299.8-9). �17adhyiitmam aj niinarrt ka tamat I pratyiitmikiin sarrtskiiriin ayonisa iitmato [corrected by Schmithausen (1987: 518 n. 1421) fr om iitmanii on the basis of the manuscript] manasikurvato yad aj niinam (Yogiiciirabhiimi: 204.10-11). 2IRAbhidharmakosabhii�ya: 139.24-140.25; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v . 2: 83-88."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"97 Pratityasamutpiidasutra. I mention it further below, especially with reference to· Consciousn�ss. In comparison, the definition in the Dasabhumikasutra, that Ignorance deludes beings regarding objects (99.1), is considerably broader if we understand iilambana to refer to all the objects of experience.219 Furthermore, the association of avidyii with iitmadrtfti noticed by Schmithausen in the Savitarkiidibhumi passage,220 and implicitly present in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, Abh idharma­samuccayabhiitfya, and Abhidharmakosabhiitfya, is not found here. 2. Karmic Forces Kajiyama Yu ichi has pointed out that sarrzskiira can have two meanings, karma and viisanii.22I In other words, it can be used in the sense of either of the meanings attributed to karma by Takasaki in his discussion of Yo ga car a doctrine: \"a residual force (viisanii, ��) insofar as it remains after having perished, and a formative force (sarrzskiira, :IT) insofar as it gives rise to the fo llowing mode of activity\" (1987: 204). Consequently, according to Kajiyama, the vijiiiina that is dependent on the sarrzskiiras also can be understood in tw� different senses, the rebirth consciousness (pratisarrzdhivijiiiina) and the six ordinary forms of consciousness (tfafj.vijiiiinakiiya), respectively. Of the texts under discussion, the Dasabhumikasutra unambiguously sticks to the first pair of meanings (i.e., karrna/p ratisarrzdhivijiiiina, and its definitions of both the Karmic Forces and Consciousness are in keeping with the definitions found in the Sarv�stivadin iivasthika interpretation of the formula, in which each member represents a different state of the five 219See Abh idharmakosa II 62c: iilambanarrz sarvadharmiiJ; (Abhidharmakosa­bhii�a: 100.3). 221l 1987: 518 n. 1421. See Chapter 2, section 85a. 22IThese two meanings occur in abhidharma (Kajiyama, personal communication), but the Taisho index suggests that the term viisanii does not appear in abhidharma texts e�r1ier than the Abhidharmakosa, except for the Vibhii�ii. Further study is necessary to establish at exactly what point viisanii, like bija, takes on the technical meaning that becomes so important in Y ogiiciira texts."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"98 skandhas.222 The Dasabhumikasutra discussion of the function of the Karmic Forces does not suggest an awareness of any of the issues associated with iilayavijiiiina or seed theory. Coming to the Savitarkiidibhumi, we fm d that in the sarzra expo­sition, the focal point of the pratztyasamutpiida formula with regard to seed theory is Consciousness. It is the role of Consciousness tha� departs radically from pre-Yogacara interpretations. In contrast, although the Karmic Forces put Consciousness \"under their sway\" (karmopagam), which implies that they \"impress\" Consciousness or leave seeds in it (Schmithausen 1987: 178), the passage never explicitly mentions bija or viisanii in connection with sarrzskiiriinga. Similarly, in the vibhanga section, there is nothing about the Karmic Forces that goes beyond the spirit of what was said in the Pratityasamutpiidasutra. The vibhanga section defines the Karmic Forces simply as karma, with no mention of viisanii,223 while it accepts the sutradefinition of vijiiiina as the six vijiiiinakiiyas.224 Thus, if we are to take the Savitarkiidibhumi vibhanga defmitions at face value, karma from the earlier lifetime causes the six types of consciousness in the later life. This relationship, however, is problematic in a technical context, in which, as Kajiyama and Takasaki suggest, karma should be the cause of pratisarrzdhivijiiiina, not of the vijiiiinakiiyas. However, when we look at the vibhaliga description of cak�urvi­jiiiina, it is clear that the sarrzskiira that conditions vijiiiina is not, in fact, 222See Chapter 5. 223kiiyasa1!lskiirii� katame / kiiyakarma kiimiivacara1!l rupavaciira1!l pur;yiipur;yasa1!lkhyiitam adha urdhva1!l punar iinifijyasa1!lkhyiita1!l / viiksa1!lskiirii� ka tame / viikkarma / se�a1!l purvavad dra�tavya1!l / mana�sa1!lskiirii� katame / manaskarma / tat kiimadhiitau pur;yiipur;ya1!l niinefijy a1!l dvayor up arimayor dhiitvor iinefijyam eva ca (Yogiiciirabhumi: 206.10-13). 224ca/gur vijfiiina1!l katamat / iiy atyii1!l ca/gurindriyiisrayiiyii rilpaprativijfiapt!a:yat pur;yiipu7Jyiinefijygp.aribhiivitabijabhuta1!l vijfiiina1!l yac ca tadbijasamudbhavam phalabhuta1!l / yathii ca/gurvijfiiinam eva1!l srotraghriir;ajihviikiiyamanovijfiiiniini dra�tavyiini / iisrayavi�ayakrtas cai�a prativijfiaptivise�o dra�!avya� / tat puna� kiimiivacara1!l �a4vidha1!l rupiivacara1!l caturvidham iirupyiivacaram elcavidham eva (Yogiiciirabhumi: 206.14-18).

Analysis contains a somewhat archaic doctrine of Seeds (bija) according to which vijiiiina-still understood as the [mental series constituted by successive moments of one or the other of] the six ordinary kinds of vijiiiina­\"approaches\" or \"follows\" (-upaga-) karman, i.e. comes under its sway by being somehow \"impressed\" by it so that it becomes the cause or Seed of the (vipiika-)vijiiiina which is the initial factor of a new existence\" (1987: 178). Schmithausen's explanation is perhaps as difficult to understand as the passages themselves, but it emphasizes that, even though the Savitarkiidibhumi still interprets vijiiiina as the six vijiiiinas, it has broadened their definition to include both actualized Consciousness and seeds. If Schmithausen is correct, and the vipiikavijiiiina at this stage is still somehow identical to the six ordinary vijiiiinas, then sarrzskara must at the same time \"form\" the pratisarrzdhivijiiiina and be the \"residual force\" fr om . which future ca�urvijiiiina, etc., arises. Furthermore, in the sarira section of the exposition of pratitya­samutpiida in the Savitarkiidibhumi226 it is clear that the way in which the Karmic Forces condition Consciousness by bringing it \"under its sway\" is not the same way in which the karma of the past life, according to the Dasabhumikasutra as well as to Sarvastivada, conditions Consciousness by producing pratisarrzdhivijiiiina in the present life. Thus, both the sarlra and the vibhanga sections at least implicitly suggest the impressioning or seed-planting function of the Karmic Forces. The explanation of the first function of sarrzskiira in the Abhidharma­samuccaya consists of a very terse statement about how the Karmic Forces work in determining rebirth, that is to say about their formative 225Unlike me, Schmithausen does not seem to consider the sarfra portion to be earlier than the remainder of the Savitarkiidibhumi pratftyasamutpiida exposition. 22·See Chapter 3, section C2."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"100 function. This is essentially the same as the first function in the, Dasabhiimikasiitra. However, the Abhidharmasamuccaya defmes their second function as acting as the conditions of the vasanas contained in Consciousness. This is dramatically different fr om the definition in the Dasabhiimikasiitra, as well as from the Sarvastivadin avasthika definition of sarrzskara. Furthermore, it goes beyond what is found in either of the sections of the exposition of prafityasamutpiida in the Savitarkadibhiimi that I have discussed. The Abhidharmasamuccaya, as we have seen above, includes Consciousness among the projecting members and thereby assigns it to the earlier of two lifetimes. Moreover, as we have also seen, Consciousness as understood in the Abhidharmasamuccaya has been identified with the karmabijas by the Ch 'eng wei shih lun.227 The present definition in the Abhidharma­samuccaya of the second function of the Karmic Forces, together with that of the first function of Consciousness, which fo llows, is probably the basis for this identification. In the section on the sets of members (aitgasamasa), the causal role of Consciousness is emphasized, a fact that suggests to me that the pratityasamutpiida exp osition of the Abh idharmasamuccaya presupposes a more fully developed concept of iilayavijiiana than that which underlies the Savitarkadibhiimi discussion� As I have mentioned, the Abhidharmasamuccaya in general avoids terminology usually associated with Yogacara, such as vasana and bija. However, in order to justify an interpretation of vijftana that stresses its causal aspect, the text is here forced to be more explicit than usual. By introducing the term vasana into its definition of sarrzskaraitga, it rationalizes the inclusion of vijftanaitga in the group of projecting members. If the Karmic Forces were stated here to be the condition of Consciousness, instead of the condition of the impressions contained in Consciousness, then they would represent the \"formative force\" of karma, and the Consciousness resulting from them would have to be reassigned to the group 'of projected members. The ability to project belongs,properly speaking, to 227SeeChapter 3, section 0,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"1 01 karma,228 and only if Consciousness is identified with kamia can it belong to the projecting group of members. Thus, for the sake of maintaining consistency between its interpretation of pratltyasamutpiida and the particular theory of iilayavijfiiina and bijas to which it subscribes, the Abhidharmasamuccaya must emphasize the \"residual force\" of karma. To do so, it must depart at an earlier point than the Savitarkiidibhumi fr om giving a simple, non-innovative interpretation of the formula, namely at sa1!!Skiira rather than vijfiiina. The treatment in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, although terse, is more sophisticated than that in the Savitarkiidibhumi or the Dasabhumika­sutra, and it systematically incorporates both backward-looking and forward-looking definitions in the section on the function of the members (angakarmavyavasthiina). Thus, the first function of the Karmic Forces is the performance, under the influence of Ignorance, of the karma that, according to its moral nature, produces rebirth in one of the various destinies; this is avidyiipratyayarrz sarrzskiiram. The second function is the depositing of the impressions that comprise the following member, vijfiiina; this is the sarrzskiira in sa1!!Skiirapratyayarrz vijfiiinam. The crucial difference between the Abhidharmasamuccaya and the Dasabhumikasutrais that the Abhidharmasamuccaya states explicitly that the nature of the causal relationship between the Karmic Forces and Consciousness is one of impressioning or impregnation. In the Dasabhumikasutra, on the other hand, the Karmic Forces \"provide the cause of the generation of Consciousness,\" the first function of which is to \"bring about conception into the next existence\" (99.3_4).229 Schmithausen has shown that the Yogacaras use iilayavijfiiina to solve the problem of dependence of Consciousness on the Karmic Forces (1987: 6). Referring to a number of texts, including the Mahii­yiinasarrzgraha, Pratltyasamutpiidavyiikhyii, Tr irrzsikiibhii�ya, Pafica-228See, for example, a portion of Vasubandhu's discussion of pratftyasamutpada in the Abhidharmakosabha$ya, to which I refer again later: tdsyavidyapratyayab salf/S¥irab karmak$epavaSac ca vijizanasaTfltatis taTfl taTfl gatiTfl gacchati (Abhidharma­kosabha!fYa: 140. 1-2). 229 See Chapter 2, section 85d."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"102 skandhaprakara1}avaibhii�ya, Paficaskandhabhii�ya, and Ch 'eng wei shih iun, he says, \"the sa1!Zskiira-pratyaya1!Z vijfiiinam is the vijfiiina of the prior existence which receives the Impression of karman and - by continuously propagating itself along with this Impression - becomes, in its turn, the cause of a new existence (beginning with niimarupa). This exegetical issue thus involves the systematical issue of (alaya)vijfiana as the recipient and support of karmic Impressions (viisanii)\" (1987: 253-254 n. 51). The description of the second function of the Karmic Forces in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, together with the location of vijfiiina in the projecting group of members, suggests that the exposition of pratztyasamutpiida in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, which is probably earlier than the Mahiiyiinasa1!Zgraha and almost certainly older than the other texts mentioned by Schmithausen, already presupposes a vijfiiina that can, in Schmithausen's terminology, receive and support karmic impressions. In other words, it presupposes iiiayavijfiiina. 3. Individual Existence The defmition o\"f niimarupa in the Pratztyasamutpiidasutra, which is quoted in the Savitarkiidibhumi,230 is a very basic one, and it can be found as well in early Vaibha�ika texts such as the Abhidharmiimrta.23\\ However, even this very simple definition immediately suggests some rather complex problems. If, in the pratztyasamutpiida formula, niimarupa is dependent on vijfiiina and at the same time consists, partly of vijfiiinaskandha, then the question arises as to how vijfiiina can be included in two angas. Schmithausen shows how the Vaibha�ikas get around this problem in two different contexts. In their interpretation of the formula in terms of a single moment (h;a1}ikapratztyasamutpiida), they alter the definition of niimarupa so as to exclude vijfiiinaskandha.232 In their iivasthika interpretation, on 230See Chapter 2, section B5d. 23Iiiti�1T����\\1l�o 1lY*&j§;�:;!jH\\1l�o =$�m�� (T. 1553: 971a21-23; Sastri 1953: 71.17-18; Van den Broeck 1977:135). 232Individual Existence consists of the four skandhas that appear together with vijiiiina (vijiiiinasahabhuvas catviiralJ skandhii niimarup am-Abhidharmakosabhii�a:"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"103 the other hand, both vijiiiina and niimariip a consist of all five skandhas at different moments (Schmithausen 1987: 464). According to the discussion of iivasthikap ratftyasamutpiida in the Abhidharmakosa, niimariipa refers to the skandhas from the moment of conception (pratisarrzdhi) to the moment immediately preceding the development of the Six Senses,233 that is to say, to a stage of the embryo.234 Another issue involving niimariipiinga arises from the statement found in several siitras that vijiiiina and niimariipa, like two bunches of reeds , are mutually dependent; Schmithausen identifies the Na f/akaliipikiisiitra of the Sarrzyuktiigama235 as being the primary source of the discussion of this issue in the Mahiiyiinasarrzgraha (1987: 170, 460 n. 1076). Schmithausen discusses the interpretation of this simile in great detail, mainly to refute Kajiyama's thesis that \"the 133.4; referred to in Schmithausen 1987: 173, 464 ns. 1110, 1114). Paramiirtha's translation agrees with the Sanskrit: w.�m�Im�!�iS (T. 1559: 205e8). However, as La Vallee Poussin points out (1971, v. 2: 65 n. 2), Hsiian-tsang alters this in his translation to three skandhas (�f�;t=:li$!l��iS-T. 1558: 48cI2). For a complete discu!lsion of this issue, see Yamaguchi and Funahashi 1955: 169-1 70, ns. 1, 7. 233 sarrzdhicittiit parelJa yiivat �a4iiyatanarrz notpadyate sii 'vasthii niimarftparrz tiivat �a4iiyatanam ity ucyate (Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 132.3-4). 234Moreover, in the portion of the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya in which, as I show in my chapter on sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijfiiinam, he expounds his own, provisional opinion, Vasubandhu contradicts the definition according to k�alJikapratitya­samutpiida : viJfiiinapurvakarrz punas tasyiirrz tasyiirrz gatau niimaruparrz Jiiyate paficaskandh akarrz krtsnajanmiin ugatarrz / vibhQ/ige mahiinidiinaparyiiye caivarrz nirddat (Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 140.5-6; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 85). As the Abhidharmakosavyiikhyii states, the definition to which Vasubandhu here refers is the sutra definition according to which niima consists of fo ur skandhas (vedanii, sarrzjfiii, sarrzskiira, and vijfiiina) and rftpa of one (rftpaskandha): yibham�a evam nirdesiid iti.

In this particular case, Vasubandhu's definition coincides with that of the iivasthika interpretation since both agree that niimarupiiliga consists of five skandhas. Again, Vasubandhu fo llows the same sutra upon which the exposition of pratftyasamutpiida in the Savitarkiidibhumi is a commentary. 235T. 99 (no. 288): 81b."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"104 exegesis of the relation between vijiiiina and niimarupa played an important if not the decisive role in the fo rmation of the concept of alayavijiUina\" (1987: 171). Although he concludes that \"a connection of alayavijfiiina with the context of the mutual dependence of vijiiiina and niimariipa is not found before Mahayanasarpgraha\" (198}: 171), Schmithausen refers to a number of other texts in which mutual dependence is mentioned, among them both Vaibhii�ika (e.g., the Vibhii�ii and Ny iiyiinusiira) and Yogacara works (e.g., the Yo giiciira­bhumi). In fact, we have seen that the Dasabhumikasutra defines the first function of niimarupa as forming the \"mutual support\" (99.5); as I indicate in my translation, this must refer to its relationship of mutual dependence with vijiiiina. The. challenge of solving the problems raised by either the \"doubling\" of vijiiiina (its inclusion in two angas) or the mutual of dependence ofvijiiiina and niimariipa would seem to provide a Yogacara author with the opportunity t6 \"prove\" the existence of iiZayavijiiiina; in fact, the Ma hiiyiinasarrzgraha does precisely this.236 The Abhidharma­samuccaya; however, is not concerned with proving the existence of iiZayavijiiiina, so it does not address these questions. Nevertheless, the understanding of niimariipa revealed by the defmition of its functions in the Abhidharmasamuccaya presupposes, I believe, an identification of sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijiiiinam with iiZayavijiiiina. To understand what the Abhidharmasamuccaya means when it says that \"Individual Existence makes beings grasp the basis of personal existence,\"237 it may be helpful to look at a portion of the Yo giiciira­bhumi, in which a similar notion is expressed in greater detail, as well as at the Ch 'eng wei shih Zun, in which the position of the Abhidhartna­samuccaya is explained and criticized.

However, I am not sure that this passage must be read as unambiguously separating pratisarrzdhivijiiiina from niimarupa; the extremely confused syntax of the passage makes it difficult to determine the exact temporal relationship between the pratisarrzdhiphalavijiiiina and niimariip a. In any case, what concems me here is the use of the term \"basis of personal existence\" (iitmabhiiva) in a context similar to that in which the Abhidharmasamuccaya uses it. Throughout his book on iilayavijiiiina, Schmithausen discusses this term and identifies fo ur aspects of iitmabhiiva, that \"are not mutually exclusive but may be variously stressed or ignored according to the context.\" Among these four he identifies a \"qualitative aspect,\" in which iitmabhiiva is similar to nikiiyasabhiiga, and a \"concrete aspect,\" referring to \"the constituents on which a certain personal existence is based, or which forms its 23Rsa kiila/'fl krtvii piirviintiid vartamiine 'dhvany iitmabhiivam abhinirvartayaty anupiirvelJa miitub ku�au hetuvijiiiina[pratyaya/'fl-Schmithausen's emendation from the manuscript (1987: 468 n. 1130)] pratisandhiphalavijiiiina/'fl yiivad eva kalalatviidibhir avasthiivise�air uttarottarais tasya garbhagatasya niimariipasya yiiva} jlrl}atviiya (Yogiiciirabhiimi: 199.3-5).

In both the Abhidharmasamuccaya arid Savitarkiidibhumi passages under discussion here, the concrete aspect of iitmabhiiva seems prominent. The beginning of the iitmabhiiva in the new life, which consists of either the pratisa7!ldhivijiiiina together with niimarUpa at the same moment, or the pratisa7!ldhivijiiiina immediately followed' by the niimarupa, is the karmic result of the causal consciousness from the preceding life.239 The fact that these are the only two passages that I have come across in which the term iitmabhiiva is used in the context of niimarupa in the prafityasamutpiida formula further suggests that the Savitarkiidibhumi is a major source of the exposition of pratityasamut­piida in the Abhidharmasamuccaya.240 Another peculiarity of the terminology, or rather phrasing, of the Abhidharmasamuccaya here is the use of the verb, griihayati, which, like almost all of the verbs in the section on the function of the members, is causative. Unlike in the Dasabhumikasutra, where the functions attributed to the ailgas fr om Individual Existence through Feeling are rather passive and are, for the most part, related to the process of cognition, in the Abhidharmasamuccaya they are decidedly active and are related to the process of rebirth. This can be explained, I believe, by the fact that the Abhidharmasamuccaya, when it refers to the 239The Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya, on the other hand, stresses the qualitative aspect by relating the arising of niimarupa to the distribution of beings among the nikiiyasabhiigas. 241lln the Sriivakabhumi, the term iitmabhiivaphala appears as the result due to an ignorance of which the causal chain leading to the projection ofa new existence begins (SriivakabhUmi:, 384.8; Wayman 1961: 114; Sriivakabhumi [tib.]: 169b3; T. 1579: 454b 16.

The Ch 'eng wei shih lun suggests that the Abhidharma­samuccaya, as well as the Dasabhumikasutra and the Pratityasamutpiida­sutra, refers to the members from Consciousness to Feeling as actual entities rather than as bijas because it designates these angas from the point of view of the time of their actualization, when they appear in the order of the formula, rather than from the point of view of their causal state, when they are still simultaneous.241 This explanation is convincing since the Abhidharmasamuccaya here is, in fact, explaining the prafitya­samutpiida formula per se, in the order in which it is traditionally presented, rather than in the rearranged order found in the section on the sets of members. More specifically, the Ch ' eng wei shih lun states that, in the section on the sets of members in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, niimariipa includes the bijas ofvipiikavijiiiina.242 If, keeping this assertion in mind, we examine the statement that niimariipiiJiga \"makes beings grasp the basis of personal existence,\" we can see that actualized niimariipa would have no power to cause a being to do anything; it is, essentially, the being itself. However, if niimarupiiJiga consists of the seeds of the first moment or moments of the karrnically produced next life, then one can understand how it has the potential to make beings commence a new existence. In the immediately following discussions of the Six Senses, Contact, and Feeling, the Abhidharmasamuccaya similarly uses verbs indicating capabilities that can only be explained if these aJigas represent seeds rather than actualized entities. The notion that a member of the formula can be a seed seems to 241T. 1585: 42c13-14; Shindojoyuishikiron: 355; La Vallee Poussin 1928-1 929: 483.

The section entitled vibhanga (vibhiiga) of the same exposition (summarized in my translation of the section of the Abhidharmasamuccaya on the functions of the members) appears to have applied some concepts fr om the sarira section to the individual members of the formula (Yogiiciirabhumi: 204.1-212.4). However, the seed theory implicit in the Abhidharmasamuccaya exposition is, as I have mentioned in Chapter Three, somewhat different from the theory (or theories) found in the Yo giiciirabhumi. According to the explanation of niimarupa in the section on vibhanga in the Savitarkiidibhumi, the term refers to a seed that is contained in the seed of consciousness (presumably, the consciousness that has been projected by karma from the previous life), as well as to niimarilpa in the form of the actualized result of that seed. In the Abhidharmasamuccaya system, on the other hand, niimarupa is not contained in the seed of consciousness; Tather, it is the seed of the resultant consciousness itself. Nor does it refer to the actualized niimarilp a, which is only to be found injiityanga. Similarly, in the discussions of the Six Senses, Contact, and Feeling, the Abh idharmasamuccaya seems to have refined the Savitarkiidibhumi theory so that seeds and actualized dharmas no longer are included in the same member.

In this respect, at least, their definition is quite close to the iivasthika definition in the Abhidharmakosa, as explained in the Abhidharma­.kosabhii�ya and Abhidharmakosavyiikhyii. According to the iivasthika interpretation of the formula, Individual Existence refers to a stage of the embryo in which only two of the organs, namely manas and kiiya, are present,245 while the Six Senses refer to the stage at which the other . four organs have developed.246 This explains the comment of the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya that the remaining organs are no longer lacking.

Contact a. The Abhidharma Controversy about Sp ada In this section, before discussing how sparsa functions as a member of the pratftyasamutpiida formula according to the Abhidharma_ samuccaya, I examine the abhidharma debate concerning the reality of sp ada, as well as the Yogacara position on this issue. In the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, the defmition of spada is presented as a subject of controversy. According to Sarvastivada, sp ada is a real dharma, defined as that which is produced by the coming together of three dharmas.248 The opponents, on the other hand, say that it is not a dharma in itself, but simply the coming together of the three. Jaini, in the introduction to his edition of the Abhidharmadfpa {l959b: 59), identifies the sutra source of the \"Sautrantika,,249 position as being similar to a passage from the MadhupilJrjikasutta of the Majjhimanikiiya,250 . and he says that the Vaibha�ika position is based on the $at�atkasiitra.25\\ Furthermore, in the Sarrzyuktiigama, one can find two siitras that seem to support the two different positions.252 248However, it is not clear that all Sarvastivadin texts agree with this definition. The � PrakaraQapiida (JliiJ mi!J�!hIM�ii):EJ�), for example, defines sp arsa simply as having the nature of the coming together of the three (Ji;j�fJiJo �-=tD,g.'ti-T. 1542: 693a13-14). ' 249Jaini uses this term, but the text itself does not identify the opponents. Since this position is attributed to the Da�tantika in the Vi bhii�ii, and since Vasubandhu does not accept it, I shall refer to it as a Dar�tantika position. 2sIIJaini refers to a passage quoted in the Abhidharmakqsavyiikhyii: ata indriya­vi�aya-vijfiiina-traya\"f!'l sp ada-bhutam (Abhidharmakosavyiikhyii: 304.33-34).

Honjo also refers to Sa\"f!'lyuktiigama 304 (1984: 41 ).' 252Sa\"f!'lyuktiigama 306: \"The conditions cakfus and riipa produce cakfurvijfiiina; the: coming together of the three is sp ada\" (IIlt§'�1=.IllUI&-=$tD,g.��-T. 99: 87c26-27);"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"111 Jaini implies that the view of sp ada as a separate dharma prevails the abhidharma (1959b: 59).

The Dar�1iintikas, however, object to this reasoning, saying that the sutra in fact does mention things that are already included in other categories; for example, vedanii and tr�1Jii belong to one of the six so­called external iiyatanas, namely, dharmiiyatana.279 The Sarvastivadins respond by pointing out the diff erence between the \"repetition\" of vedanii and tr�1Jii and the mention of spada in this context.

Vasubandhu's Position In order to ascertain Vasubandhu's personal opinion, we must return to the context of the prafityasamutpada formula as a whole. In the Abhidharmakosabha�ya, there are three general interpretations of the 'formula. The first, an explanation of each member as a state (avastha) of .the five skandhas, is accepted by the Vaibha�ikas. The second, lqar:tika, jflterpretation is an explanation of each member as it occurs in a single moment; Vasubandhu gives the example of the moment at which a .murder is committed.288 This interpretation is not, as far as I know, associated with a particular school. Finally, there is a passage in the 'comment on Abhidharmakosa III 28ab, in which Vasubandhu presents ;Pis own understanding of pratftyasamutpada. In this passage, Vasu­'bandhu often criticizes Sarvastivadin positions, seemingly from a Sautrantika point ofview,289 but in the case of sp ada, he seems to accept ithe Sarvastivadin position.

Certainly, the term sp ada seems to be used almost synonymously with trikasangama, another synonym for trikasarrznipiita, in the verse here.294 Nevertheless, I think that I can distinguish a difference between the significance of the two terms in the iivasthika interpretation. Vasubandhu uses the terms trikasangama and trikasarrznipiita in the verse and the commentary respectively to refer to the first moment of the stage, the moment of birth. However, to refer to the entire stage, he uses the term spada, again in both the verse and the commentary.295 I believe that the key to understanding this passage lies in the fact that certain members of the formula, - including sp arsa, have a strongly cognitional role, even in the \"embryological\" iivasthika system.296 If from birth to about age three, an infant or child can experience the 29!trayiir.zii'!l sa'!lnipiitiit sp ado bhavati. sa yiivad vedaniitrayakiirar.zaparicchedena samartho bhavati sii 'vasthii sp arsa ity ucyate (Abhidharmakosabhii�a: 132.10-11; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 64). 292�jiitiivasthiiyii'!l vy avasthiipyate. paripiirr.za-�a4iiyatana-sa1!lnipiita­sadbhiiviit.

Therefore, the potential for cognition that occurs at the moment of birth, trikasa1!lnipiita, is the cause, in some sense, of spada. In this way, I believe, the Sarvastivadins' embryological explanation of sp ada in the pratityasamutpiida formula can be reconciled with their insistence in other contexts that sp arsa is a dharma that exists independently from organ, object, and consciousness, but that is caused by the coming together of the three. Coming to Va subandhu's own exposition of pratltyasamutpiida in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya commentary on Abhidharmakosa III 28ab, we are immediately confronted with a textual problem. According to Pradhan's Sanskrit text,297 sparsa is the coming together of the three.298 If we accept . his reading, it would appear that Vasubandhu here, as is frequently the case, favors a Dar�1antika/Sautrantika opinion. However, the Chinese and TIbetan translations all differ from Pradhan's text, and they all suggest an original Sanskrit trayiil'Jii1!l sa1!lnipiitajab (\"produced by the coming together of the three\")299 or trayiil'Jii1!l sa1!lnipiitiit (\"as a result of the coming together of the three\").300 These versions suggest that Vasubandhu here accepts the Sarvastivadin position. Unfortunately, Yasomitra and Sthiramati neither comment on nor even quote the definition of sp ada in Vasubandhu's exposition301 so we are unable to know what version of the 297trayaIJiirrz sarrznipiita� sp ar.§a� sukhiidivedanfya� (Abhidharmakasabhii�ya: 140.7-8). Pradhan's reading here has been confirmed by inspection of a photocopy of the manuscript. . 298Mejor's translation reflects the Sanskrit text: \"there is a meeting of the three [viz. visual consciousness, sense of vision, object of vision, etc.], [and this is called] 'contact', [which may be felt as pleasant etc.]\" (1991: 96). 299Paramartha's Chinese translation: ;xM-IlUsifjL.l\"H�o El3�l�i&o :jj£=;fD.g-�U!ljo ��1i ����Mf (T. 1559: 208a23-24). 3\"\"Hsiian-tsang's Chinese translation: *:W-:J:1t.g-1flr��o =;fD�tlr}IIl[���!Ij (T. 1558: 5Ib3-4.

On the basis then of the available sources, I believe that Vasubandhu in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya accepts the Sarvastivadin, rather than the Dar�tantika, definition of sp ada. My conclusion is supported by the fact that Vasubandhu elsewhere· either implicitly or explicitly grants sp ada the status of an independent dharma. In the Paiicaskandhaka/02 he defines sp ada simply as one of the universally present (sarvatraga) dharmas, without referring to any difference of opinion, while in the Pratltyasamutpiidavyiikhyii, in his exposition of �a4iiyatanapratyayal} sp arSal}, he quotes the sidra on which the Dar�tantika position is based and proceeds to refute this position at considerable length, using some of the same arguments that he attributes to Sarvastivada in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya.303 3112reg pa gan ze na / gsum 'dus nas yons su gcod pa '0 (Paficaskandhaka [tib.]: 14a2).

Sparsa in Yogacara Texts If, in fact, Vasubandhu accepts the Sarvastivadin defin�tipn of sparsa as a separate dharma, it is not surprising. As I shall argue in more detail later in this chapter and in following ones, Vasubandhu, in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, when discussing a controversial point, . tends to side with whichever position is more consonant with Yogacara doctrine. In this case, it is Sarvastivada that is closer to Yogacara. The Dar�tantika denial of the reality of sp arsa is incompatible with its status, according to Yo gacara texts such as the Ch 'eng wei shih [un, as one of the five caitasika dharmas always associated with iilayavijiiiina and thus separate and real entities. 304 However, the definitions of sp ada in earlier portions of the Yogiiciirabhiimi differ from those in later ones, and it is necessary to examine the various definitions in the Yo giiciirabhiimi in order to determine at what point Yogacara starts to identify sparsa explicitly as 'something other than the mere coming together of organ, object, and consciousness. As far as I can tell, those portions ofthe Yo giiciirabhiimi identified by Schmithausen as the oldest, i.e., the Sriivakabhiimi, Bodhisattvabhiimi, and Va stusa1?Zgraha1Jl, do not define sp ada in terms that indicate a concern with the question of its reality.305 In the Ma nobhiimi, on the other hand, most of the evidence suggests 'gyur la I gsum 'dus pa ni sems las byun ba'i chos reg pa yan ma yin no I reg pa ni btags pa yin te ris 'dra ba biin no ie na yan de ltar na mi ldan pa yin par 'gyur la de Ita bu ni sde pa gan gi grub pa 'i mtha' yan ma yin no I btsun pa gos dam rab dan mdo sde 'di iiid las gsuns pa min gan iena I tshor ba dan 'du ses dan I sems pa dan I reg pa dan I yid la byed pa '0 ies bya ba dan I sde tshan drug pa drug las kyan sde tshan drug rnams ni rigs tha dad pa las rnam par biag gi I gsum 'dus pa iiid reg pa ma yin no (Pratltyasamutpiidavyiikhyii [tib.]: 35b8-36a6). 31l4T. 1585: IlbI6-cI6, especialIy Ilc4: ?'r.i�liii3tE£.���; La ValIee Poussin 1928-1 929: 143-146.

However, immediately before this definition, sparsa, which is said to be that by which the pleasant -unpleasant, or neutral character of an object is ascertained,306 is mentioned as one of the sarvabhumika caittadharmas. Both its function and its inclusion among the sarvabhumikas imply that it is real. After this passage, in which the functions of the sarvabhumikas are described in order to prove that they are indeed present at each moment of consciousness, each dharma is defmed by a single noun, nominal compound, or very brief nominal phrase.307 In this context, we find the definition: \"What is sp arsa? ° The coming together of the three.\" Thus, the term is probably used here, not to indicate the author's rejection of spada as a real entity, but simply for convenience since, as we have seen, the term trikasaf!lnipiita is found in the sutras and can thus be understood as a kind of shorthand definition.30B In the Paiicavijiiiinakiiyamanobhumi of the Viniscayasaf!lgrahar.zi, too, sp ada is included among the dharmas always associated with vijiiiina, which in this case is specified as iilayavijiiiina.309 From these passages, we can infer that sp ada is considered real and separate, but, unlike in the Sarvastivadin discussions, it is never explicitly stated to be the result of the coming together of organ, object, and consciousness In the pratyayap rabheda section of the analysis of pratityasamut­piida in the Savitarkiidibhumi, however, the question is raised as to how, 3116tatraiva subhasubhobhayaviparltalak�alJa1!l yat [tat] sp adena pratipadyate (Yogacarabhiimi: 59.17-18; see Schmithausen 1987: 380 n. 613). 3117manaskarab katamab I cetasa abhogab I sp adab katamab I trikasannipatab / vedana katama I anubhavana I sa1!lifia katama I safijanana I cetana katama I cittabhisa1!lskiirab (Yogacarabhiimi: 60.1-3). 3118This passage is referred to in the Sravakabhiimi of the Vi niscayasa1!lgrahalJi, which reproduces its enumeration of sarvabhiimikas (Viniscayasa1!lgrahalJl.

In this way, one can say that there is \"a change in the indriya\" at the moment of cognition; what changes must be the accumulated seed of future consciousness. Sp arsa is the registering of the nature of this change. The definitions in the Abh idharmasamuccaya and other, later '. Yogadira texts are difficult to understand. Although I have indicated my . reasons for thinking that they presuppose a theory of iiZayavijiiiina, some ·'uncertainty remains. I have been assuming that the Abhidharma­,'samuccaya definition is a refinement of ideas originating in the Yo giiciirabhiimi, but the possibility remains that the author (or authors or compiler) of the Abhidharmasamuccaya took this definition from the abhidharma of his (or their) putative Hlnayana schoo1.324 If this is, in fact, the case, there may be another explanation of the meaning of in driyavikiirapariccheda. Nevertheless, we can say, at least, that Yo gacara, like Sarvastivada, consistently grants sp ada the status of a 'separate dharma, present at every moment of consciousness.

The Function of Sp ada According to the Abhidharmasamuccaya Returning now to the function of Contact in the prati:tyasamutpiida process, we can see that the Abhidharmasamuccaya again, as in the case of the last two members (niimariip a and �acjiiyatana), stresses the active nature of its role in rebirth. That this is related to its role in the process of cognition emerges clearly from the remainder of La Vallee Poussin's translation of Sthiramati's explanation of sp ada: \"Le concours, c'est quand I' organe et I' objet produisent Ie Vijiiiina. A ce moment a lieu une modification de l'organe qui est favorable a urie sensation agreable, desagreable, neutre. [L'organe est affe cte d'une certaine maniere lorsque, avec l'obj et, il produit Ie Vijiiiina]. En confonnite avec cette modification, pareil a cette modification, a lieu Ie discernment de la qualite qu'a l'objet de pouvoir etre senti d'une maniere agreable, etc\" (1928-1929: 144 n. b). Thus, sp ada is the moment at which one becomes engaged with what one perceives and, according to the Abhid harmasamuccaya and the Tr irrzsikiibhii�ya, this engagement causes one to change internally. At this moment, which, according to the iivasth ika system, coincides with emergence from the womb in the present life,325 the chain of events begins that will result in the creation of new kanna and the next rebirth. The Abhidharmasamuccaya implies that Contact, like the rest of the projected members, refers to the seed of itself produced by the kanna of the previous lifetime. Actualized sp ada, on the other hand, is included in the member, Old Age and Death. Again, the causative verb fonn, pravartayati, can only apply to a seed, the potential of which can impel a being to do something. If the Abhidharmasamuccaya had intended for sp adiinga to refer to an actualized dharma, it would have defined it as the movement of, rather than that which turns, beings toward the experience of the sense objects. 325sparso jiitiivasthiiyi'i111 vy avasthiipyate (Abhidharmakosavyiikhyii: 285.9)."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"[ 129 e. Conclusion Thus, although the Abhidharmasamuccaya defines sp ada differently than does Sarvastivada, it does not question its status, and what it says about sp ada is congruent with the Sarvastivadin arguments for its reality as a dharma. We have seen that one of these arguments is that, if spada were not a real and separate entity, the pratltyasamutpiida formula would not include it as a member. In the exposition of pratltyasamutp iida in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, this is all the more true in that sp arsiinga must consist of bija. Therefore, if sp ada were nothing but the coming together of the three, the member designated as Contact would have to consist of the seeds of an indriya, a vi�aya, and a vijfiiina, and this would not make sense. The fact that the ;Abhidharmasamuccaya includes spada in its definition of sarrzskiiraskandha recalls the Sarvastivadin argument that sparsa would not be included among the cittamahiibhumikas if it were not real. Finally, it is clear from the definition of sp ada as indriyavikiira­.pariccheda that spada is considered to be subsequent to, and quite idifferent from, mere sarrznipiita.326 In many controversies, Vasubandhu opposes Sarvastivada and aligns himself with what he identifies as the Sautrantika position, which is usually identical with those of the Dar�tantika, Harivarman, and Srilata. In these cases, the Yo giiciirabhumi frequently contains a similar 'position, which in turn is often followed by subsequent Yogacara texts.327 In the case of sp ada, however, Va subandhu disagrees with the Dar�tantika position, and it is not coincidental that the Yogacara position is closer to the Sarvastivadin stance that he takes than to 326Another argument against sp ada's being identical to trikasarrrnipiita can be inferred from the statement in the Ch 'eng wei shih lun that sp arSiinga is exclusively non-material: 1\\ IlltdF'§. 0 jj� �a)HlUJj��lfH� )m=fl (T. 1585: 44b12; Shindojoyuishikiron: 359; La Vallee Poussin 1928-1929: 491).

According to Kat6, Dharmatrata borrows considerably from SriIata in presenting the argument on the basis of siitra against the reality of sukhavedanii, while he rejects this argument in the same way as Vasubandhu, by combining the three types of dul}khatii (du/:tkha-, parilJiima-, and saTflskiiradu/:tkhatii) with the three vedaniis (1989: 191).337 Harivarman, on the other hand, takes the opposite position in the 332asty evety iibhidhiirmikii� / e�a evaca nyiiya� (Abhidharmakosabh�ya: 330.22; fLa Vallee Poussinl971, v. 4: 130). 1 333Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 330.1 1-333.2; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 4: 130-136. f:' 334The vedaniivibhanga begins at folio 38a8 and continues to folio 41b2.

Kat6 points out the similarity between Harivarman's argument and that of Srilata as recorded by Sarpghabhadra and speculates that Harivarman, like Srilata, was a student of Kumiiralata (1989: 191-192).338 Vasubandhu again takes up the subject of vedanii several times, in the specific context of pratftyasamutpiida. In the iivasthika exposition, he defines vedanii as the state in which one becomes able to recognize the causes of the three kinds of fe elings (pleasurable, painful, or neutral).339 In his comment on Abhidharmakosa III 28a-b, where he expresses his own opinion, which follows the Pratftyasamutpiidasiitra, Vasubandhu simply refers to the fact that vedanii consists of three kinds. 340 Finally, in verse III 32, he divides vedanii into six and then eighteen types. The discussion of this verse in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya relates a disagreement between the Vaibhii�ikas and an opponent regarding the temporal relationship between sp arsa and vedanii.341 According to the Vaibha�ikas, vedanii is simultaneous with sp arsa, and the two are described as reciprocal causes (sahabhuhetu). The opponent, who is not named here by either the Bhii:fya or the Abhidharmakosavyiikhyii, but agrees with the Nyiiyiinusiira, of two types of vedanii: chih ch 'u shou *Allt'!lt and tzu hsing shou §'t!l:'!lt (T. 1563: 783a26-b4; see also T. 1562: 338c26).

This theory postulates three moments: (1) the moment in which , the organ and the object come into proximity; (2) the moment in which vijiiiina is produced, which, for Srllata, is equivalent to and simultaneous with sp ada; (3) the moment in which vedanii is produced as a result of spada.346 The Vaibha�ika shows that this theory results in an illogical explanation of cognition347 and that it contradicts the principle of universally occurring (mahiibhUmika) dharmas, according , to which vijiiiina is always accompanied by sp arsa and vedanii, as well as by eight other dharmas. 342It appears as though La Vallee Poussin is fo llowing Saeki (1978, v. 2: 432 ff.) in attributing this position to the Sautrantih.

The heart, I thi�k, of the Vaibhii�ika argument is that Sriliita's position undermines the logically necessary association between the consciousness of an object and the mental factors that accompany consciousness of that particular object (Abhidharmakosabhii�a: 145:21-146.2; Abhidharmakosavyiikhyii: 307.17-308.19; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 103)."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"134 The opponent replies to this argument by attacking the Vaibhii�ka category of mahiibhumikas. First of all, he says that he does not recognize as authority the abhidharma, in which the category is found. Next, he proposes a different interpretation of the term mahiibhumika. There are three groups of three bhumis, in which the term bhumi refers to respectively: planes of existence or meditational states (savitarkii . saviciirii, avitarkii saviciirii, and avitarkii aviciirii bhumis); groups of dharmas classified according to their moral status (kusalii, akusalii, and avyiilq-tii bhumis); and groups of dharmas classified according to the type of person with which they are associated (saik$z, asaik$z, and naivasaik$z [niisaik$i] bhumis). If a dharma, for example, vedanii, is found in all nine of these bhumis, it is called mahiibhumika; it does not have to be present in every moment of consciousness.348 - According to Yasomitra,349 the correct understanding of when vedanii occurs can be found by consulting the Paiicaskandhaka,350 . according to which two groups of dharmas are distinguished. Chanda, adhimok$a, smrti, samiidhi, and praj iiii are of limited occurrence (pratiniyatavi$aya). For example, chanda is defined as desire for an agreeable object, and, as Yasomitra points out, if the object is disagreeable, there will be no desire.351 In contrast, vedanii, sarrzjfiii, sp ada, manaskiira, and cetanii are specifically said to be universal; therefore, Yasomitra implies, they must be simultaneously present in every moment of consciousness.352 348The text here is not completely clear about whose opinion this is. According to the Sanskrit, this passage belongs at the end of what \"others say\" (Abhidharma­kosabhii�ya: 146.11). According to the Tibetan, the sentence de dag ni ci rigs par rnam grans kyis yin gyi I thams cad cig car ni ma yin no is introduced by gian dag na re and concluded by ues zer ro, thus separating it from the preceding non-Vaibha�ika definition of mahiibhumika (Abhidharmakosabhiirya [tib.]: 157a1).

In this case; Vasubandhu agrees with the Vaibha�ikas regarding the meaning of mahiibhumika and the simultaneity of spada and vedanii and disagrees with the opponent, even though he only accepts half of the Vaibha�ikas' list of mahiibhumikas as being truly universal. Elsewhere, Yasomitra refers to the Paiicaskandhaka to show the contrast between a position mentioned in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya and Vasubandhu's own. For example, when Vasubandhu comments on Abhidharmakosa II 24, which gives the Vaibhii�ika list of mahiibhumikas, he uses the word kila to indicate that he himself does not believe that they are all present at every . moment, and Yasomitra mentions the definitions of chanda and adhimo�a in the Paiicaskandhaka to illustrate that Vasubandhu really believes that they are pratiniyata.3S3 The argument continues in the Abhidharmako�abhii�ya with another exchange regarding the opponent's assertion that vedanii follows spada.354 This exchange ends with the Vaibhii�ikas having the last word and declaring, \"Therefore, whenever there is vijiiiina, there must be sp ada, and vedanii must be produced together with sp arsa.\"355 Vasu­bandhu in the Bhii�ya thus rejects the various positions of the opponent below). Certain Tibetan siddhiinta texts, such as the Blo gsal grub mtha', also mention a Sautrantika teacher who, contrary to the standard Sautrantika position that, among the caitasikas, only vedanii and sarrzjiiii are real, accepts these five, which are identified as sarvatraga. The identity of this teacher is unclear. Although his name is given as Buddhadeva in certain texts, the opinion attributed to him contradicts that of a famous Buddhadeva who, in the Vi bhii�ii, is said to believe that the caitasikas are not independent dharmas (Mimaki 1979: 198; 1980: 151, 166-169 ns. 15-17). 353Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 55.19; Abhidharmakosavyiikhyii: 127.20-23; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 1: 153-156. 354Actually, there is a very problematic sentence concerning akusalamahiibhumika dharmas between the end of the opponent's explanation of mahiibhiimika and the beginning of this Vaibha�ika rejoinder. According to Yamaguchi, this sentence is perhaps related to the discussion of the manopaviciiras that follows Abhidharmakosa III 32c-d (Yamaguchi and Funahashi 1955: 311-312 n. 5). 355tasmiid avasyarrz sarvatra vijiiiine sp arSab sp arSasahajii ca vedanai�!avyii (A bhidharmakosabhiifYa: 146.23-24; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 105-107)."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"136 re�arding vedanii in favor of that of the Vaibha�ikas, whicli, as Ya somitra points out, coincides in this case with what Vasubandhu says in the Paficaskandhaka. b.

In summary, of the passages from the Yo giiciirabhumi discussed above, the Sriivakabhumi and the Savitarkiidibhumi define the three types of vedanii wi�hout reference to du�khatii, while the Va stu­sarrzgraha1}I, Paryiiyasarrzgraha1}l, and Viniscayasarrzgraha1}1 all relate the three vedaniis to the three du�khatiis. The question then presents itself as to why certain texts connect the two doctrines in this way, while others do not. Of course, the point of the teaching of three du�khatiis is to show that what at first seems pleasant or neutral is ultimately to be experienced as suffering, and it is natural to state, as does the Sarrzyuktiigama passage mentioned above, that one should regard even pleasant experience as du�kha. However, the passage implies, and the Va stusarrzgraha1}1 makes explicit by use of the term, \"correct view,\" that the statement, \"Everything experienced is du�kha,\" is an epistemological one. The fact that the Va stusarrzgraha1}i defines the \"self-nature\" of vedanii as sukha-, du�kha-, and adu�khiisukhavedanii indicates that it accepts the ontological reality of all three vedaniis. At the same time, it suggests to me that, by the time of the composition of the Va stusarrzgraha1}l, the ontological status of sukhavedanii was already being questioned. Therefore, although the Yo giiciirabhumi, as Harada says, does not record a controversy, the Va stusarrzgraha1Jl, fo llowed by the Vi niscayasarrzgraha1Jl and Paryiiyasarrzgraha1Jl, may in fact be reacting to early proponents of the view, later accepted by SriHita and Harivarman, that sukhavedanii does not really exist. Following Harada, I have argued that the texts that explain the meaning of the statement \"everything experienced is du�kha\" do so in order to show that sukhavedanii exists even though it must be recognized as unsatisfactory. As for the other two texts, we can speculate that the Sriivakabhumi, probably the oldest of all the material under discussion, was written before the reality of sukhavedanii was questioned.

On the other hand, if we follow Aramaki, who believes that the Viniscayasarrzgrahar.zl belongs to the middle layer and the Savitarkiidibhiimi to the latest, we can speculate that, for the author(s) of the Savitarkiidibhumi, the issue is already settled, with sukhavedanii so thoroughly integrated into the Yo giiciira abhidharma system that there is no longer any need to justify its existence.

Let us now return to the Abhidharmakosabha�ya. If, as I suspect, Vasubandhu's purpose in writing the Bha�ya was to produce retroactively an abhidharma that would support Yogiiciira doctrine, it is understandable that he would defend the ontological reality of sukhavedana.

Vedanii in the Abhidharmasamuccaya i. The Existence of Sukhavedanii Although the Abhidharmasamuccaya does not refer to the controversy over the reality of sukhavedanii, it mentions sukhavedanii or sukh a on several occasions. Sometimes the terms occur in the enumeration of categories from iigama. For example, in its definition of vedaniiskandha, the Abhidharmasamuccaya mentions the traditional six types of vedanii according to the sense organs from which they arise; each of these six types is subdivided into sukha-, dulJ,kha-, and adulJ,khii­sukhavedanii.373 Sukha also appears in discussions of the dhyiinas. In the section on samudayasatya, sukha is said to be one of the sensations accompanying riiga in kiimadhiitu and the first three dhyiinas (Pradhan 1950: 51.7-9). Furthermore, in the section on miirgasatya, sukha is listed as one of the ai/gas of each of the first three dhyiinas of laukikamiirga, while adulJ,khiisukhavedanii is an ai/ga of the fourth dhyiina (Abhi­dharmasamuccaya: 32.21 -24). In our section on pratltyasamutpiida, too, the real existence of . sukhavedanii is implied, although not explicitly stated. Since karma is of three types, good, bad, and neutral, it follows that when the seed of .. vedanii is actualized the resulting feelings will be of three types, sukhii, 372This sentence undoubtedly grossly oversimplifies a very complicated issue in the ...

After stating that sarrzskiiraskandha consists of cetanii, the other caita'sika dharmas, with the exception of vedanii and sarrzi fiii, and the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras, the Sanskrit text asks the question, \"And what are they?\" The answer is a list of the caitasikas, except for the three mentioned . above (ifiyarrz cetanii vedaniirrz sarrzifiarrz ca sthiipayitvii tadanye caitasikii dharmiis cittaviprayuktiis ca sarrzskiiriiiJ sarrzskiiraskandha ity ucyate / te punaiJ katame / manaskiiraiJ sp arSaiJ chanda ... viciiras ca-Abhidharmasamuccaya: 15.9-16): in other words, all the sarrzskiiras except for .cetanii. After the list, all the cittasarrzprayukta­.sarrzskiiras, including cetanii, are defined. Then the question is asked, \"What are the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras?\" The answer again consists of a list, which is fo llowed by definitions. Both the Tibetan and Chinese translators seem to have noticed a problem regarding the antecedent of the pronoun te, and the differences in their readings probably represent attempts to solve it. In the Tibetan text, the question is the same as in the Sanskrit, while cetanii appears at the beginning of the list (de dag kyan gan iie na / sems pa dan / yid la byed pa dan, etc.-Abhidharmasamuccaya [tib.].. 55a7). This suggests that the Tibetan translators understood te as indicating all the' cittasarrzpra­yuktasarrzskiiras. The Chinese text, on the other hand, asks a different question: \"What are the other caitasika dharmas?\" ({iiJ�:g��,(,'PJTii-T. 1605: 664aI2). It, like the Sanskrit, omits cetanii from the list, and it seems to understand \"other caitasika dh armas\" as meaning other than cetanii, vedanii; and sarrzjfiii. Although both the Tibetan and the Chinese make better sense than the Sanskrit, I believe that Pradhan, who notes the variants (Pradhan 1950: 5 ns. 8,9), is correct in letting the Sanskrit text stand. In the case of the Chinese translation, the specification of te as tadanye caitasikii dharmiiiJ seems to be an example of Hsiian-tsang's tendency to explain, rather than simply reproduce, the text that he is translating. And the fact that cetanii is missing from the Chinese translation, as well as fr om the Sanskrit manuscript, makes it likely that it was added by the Tibetan translators, not without a purpose, as Pradhan suggests, but rather to correct what seemed like a mistake in the Sanskrit text. Rahula's \"Et que sont-elles [ces formations]?\" is not satisfactory since \"ces fo rmations\" should include cetanii (Rahula 1980: 6). 37RHsiian-tsang has, in fact, done just this in his translation of the Abhidharma­samuccayavyiikhyii.

His delusion concerning the nature of existence, namely his failure to understand that rebirth is suffering, leads him to perform new actions, which will project another . rebirth. His delusion concerning the content of existence, that is to say, his failure to understand that the world he experiences is unsatisfactory, arouses in him subconscious desire (tr�1!ii) for fe elings arising from sense-objects.38o This suggests that vedanii conditions tr�1!ii by being its . object381 and is consistent with the c�mment in the Abhidharma­samuccayabhii-DJa on the second function of vedanii: \"due to a craving for connection, etc., with it [i.e., Feeling], there is the arising of Subconscious Desire.\"382 Still, in our passage from the Abhidharmasamuccaya, the second function of vedanii is inconsistent with its being a seed rather than an ac tualized dharma. One's misunderstanding of the nature of experience should lead one to desire actual fe elings, not the potential for fe elings, with which vedaniinga (= vedaniibija) is identified. This, in fact, seems to be the way that Sthiramati understands the relationship between vedanii and tr�r.zii: in the Madhyiintavibhiiga{ikii, he says that tr�1!ii depends on vedanii that has arisen at this time from that which was previously projected.383 Therefore, it seems that sparsapratyayii vedanii is a seed belonging to the future lifetime, projected from the present, while the vedanii on which tr�1!ii depends is a dharma that was projected into the present lifetime from a still earlier lifetime and that has already been actualized. 38llYogiiciirabhiimi: 200.6-201.13.

Tr�1'}ii in Abhidharma Texts-The Context of Samudayasatya As Takasaki, who probably has in mind texts such as the sidra translated above, says, \"The positing of craving [tr�1'}ii] as the cause of suffering is the oldest formula of dependent co-arising, and even in later Buddhism desire is ever looked upon as the root of all evil\" (1987: 156). However, the topic of tr�1'}ii is not completely free fr om controversy, notably in the context of the Noble Truth of the origin of suffering (samudayasatya). Vasubandhu, in his comment on Abhidharmakosa VI 2, defines duJ:tkhasatya as the up iidiinaskandhas when they are result; samudayasatya, he says, consists of the up iidiinaskandhas when they are cause.387 In a note, La Vallee Poussin points out that not all abhidharma sources agree with this view, and he translates a passage fr om the Vibhii�ii (T. 1545: 397a28-b13) in which the following opinions are . attributed to various sources: According to the iibhidharmikas, duJ:tkhasatya consists of the up iidiinaskandhas, while sdmudayasatya is the cause of siisravadharmas; according to the Dar�tantikas, dul:tkhasatya is niimariip a, while samudayasatya is karma and klesa; and according to the Vibhajyavadins, duJ:tkhasatya consists of only those siisravadharmas that have the eight characteristics of duJ:tkha, while samudayasatya consists of only that tN1'}ii that produces rebirth.388 rogataf.! sama(n udra)�yanti / ga1J (q.a) ta {l:l) salya(to) 'gato 'n (i) tyato du{l:lkhata1.l) sunyato 'na(tma)taf.! samanu(d) rak�yanti te t(rh1}a(lfI) prahosy anti / ye (tr�1}OIfl prahosyanti te upadhilfl) prahasyanti / ye upadhi(lfI) prahas(ya)n(ti te) dulJkhalfl praha(sya)n(ti / ye duf.!khalfl prahasya)nti te (parimok�y ante) jatija(ro)­vy adhimara1}asoka(pari)deva(dulJ)kha(daurmanasyopoyosebhyalJ / parimo�yante) duf.!khod iti vadami (TripathiI962: 124-1 26). 387tatra phalabhuto upodonaskandha dulJkhasatyam / hetubhutalJ samudayasatyam / samudety asmad iti krtvo / ata eva tayolJ phalahetubhavan namato bhedo na dravyataf.!

This may be summarized as follows: everything that is duMha, including the paficaskandhas of one's own and of others' sal!ltatis,as well as all animate and inanimate skandhas, is du�khasatya. But when meditators produce insight, they should only consider their own paficaskandhas as du�kha, not those of others or all the inanimate skandhas, because dubkha is something that is to be destroyed, and having insight into the skandhas of others does not destroy that which is in one's own sal!ltati . . Similarly, everything that is samudaya is samudayasatya, but in meditation one should consider only the cause of one's own paficaskandhas.

In support of this interpretation, he refers back to the Miinu�yakasutra, from which, alluding to yet another sutra/99 he infers that tr�7Jii is the cause of rebirth in general (abhinirvrttihetu),400 karma is the cause of rebirth into specific circumstances (upapattihetu),401 and avidyii is t he cause of both tr�7Jii and karma.402 Vasubandhu then compares up apatti-and abhinirvrttihetu to a seed, which produces sprouts of a specific type of grain, and water, which causes the germination of any type of sprout.403 Next, he provides us with a logical proof that tr�7Jii must be abhinirvrttihetu: Although all people must die, only those who possess tr�7Jii are reborn; therefore, there is no rebirth without tr�7Jii, and we can know that tr�7Jii is the cause of the production of existence.404 I have been unable to trace the term abhin irvrttihetu in the abhidharma literature that precedes Va subandhu.

Therefore, it seems likely to me that, in his reasons for insisting that tr:f1!ii is not equivalent to samudayasatya, but only to abhinirvrttihetu, Vasubandhu is actually relying on Yogaciira soUrces. Before going·further into the relation between Vasubandhu's argument here and a specific passage from the Yo giiciirabhiimi, I shall explain the . background of abhinirvrttihetu and iik/fepahetu. c. Abhinirvrttihetu and Ak/fepahetu405 The best known, and probably the earliest, occurrence of a list of ten hetus is found in the Bodhisattvabhiimi. This list is followed by definitions of the individual causes, which are then assigned to two groups, janakahetu and up ayahetu, after which they are reiated to the fo ur pratyayas. Finally, three processes are described in terms of the ten causes: a) the coming into existence of everyday things (laukika bhiiva), with particular reference to grain (sasya); b) the process of defilement (sarrzklda), which is equated withprafityasamutpiida and analyzed with reference to the members of the formula; and c) the process of purification (vyavadiina), which is equivalent to pratftyasamutpiida in its reverse (pratiloma) order.406 This passage has been translated into French by Bendall and La Vallee Poussin (1911: 176-1 82) and is summarized by La Vallee Poussin in a section of his pioneering work, Th eorie des Douze Causes, entitled \"La causalite dans Ie systeme des Vijiianavadins\" (1913: 64-67). La Vallee Poussin treats this subject again in his translation of the Ch ' eng wei shih lun, which relates the ten hetus to fifteen adhi:fthiinas, as well as to the five results.407 In his notes, he provides extensive references to other occurrences of ten hetus, and he remarks.that the order in the Ch 'eng wei shih lun differs from that of the Bodhisattvabhiimi (1928-1929: 456). More recently, Funahashi has examined the relationship between the 4()5Some of the material in this section has appeared in a very abbreviated fonn in Kritzer I 994a. 4()6Bodhisattvabhiimi: 97.6- 1 02. 1; T. 1579: 501 a8 ff. 4U7T. 1585: 4Ibl3-42cI7; La Vallee Poussin 1928-1 929: 453-459."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"156 ten: hetus and the twenty kiira1}as, and he, too, notes the difference 'in order between the lists of hetus in the Bodhisattvabhumi on the one hand, and in the Savitarkiidibhumi of the Yo giiciirabhumi and the Hsien yang sheng chiao tun, as well as in the list of twenty kiira1}as (the last ten of which correspond to the ten hetus) of the Abhidharmasamuccaya, on the other (1979; see also Funahashi 1991). In the BodhisattvabhUmi, parigrahahetu separates the third hetu, iik�epahetu, from the fifth, abhinirvrttihetu. In the Savitarkiidibhiimi, abhinirvrttihetu immediately follows ii�epahetu, while parigrahahetu follows abhinirvrttihetu. In the Abhidharmasamuccaya, parigrahakiira1}a, the fifteenth kiira1}a, similarly follows number thirteen, iik�epakiira1}a, and number fourteen, abhinirvrttikiira1}a. Funahashi suggests that the difference is due to the fact that the Savitarkiidibhumi considers the hetus in relation to the scheme of fifteen adhi�thiinas, according to which siibhini�yandabija,408 with which abhinirvrttihetu is associated, precedes the group of six adhi�thiinas (Sli�tanirodha, vi�aya, indriya, kriyii, puru�akiira, and tattvadarSana)409 with which parigrahahetu is associated (Yogiiciirab­humi: 108.5-13). The Bodhisattvabhiimi, on the other hand, mentions parigrahahetu in the middle because it consists of the auxiliary causes that help the seeds that comprise ii�epahetu to become the immediate' cause of rebirth, abhinirvrttihetu.4JO Funahashi does not pursue the issue further. At this point I would like to make two comments with regard to Funahashi's article. First, the Va stusaJ?1.graha1}1 refers to the Bodhisattva­bhiimi list and reproduces it in the same order;411 as far as I can tell, Funahashi does not notice this. Although the chronological relationship between the Va stusaJ?1.graha1Jl and the Bodhisattvabhumi,' two of the oldest sections of the Yo giiciirabhumi, is still unclear, this reference in 4U8 According to La Vallee Poussin's translation of the Ch 'eng wei sh ih fun, sasnehabijiidhi�!hiina. 4U9 According to La Vallee Poussin, anantaraniruddha-, vi�aya-, indriya-, karalJa-, ;. puru�akiira-, and ta ttvadarSaniidhi�!hiina (La Vallee Poussin 1928-1929: 456-457). . 41uFunahashi 1979: 329-330; La Vallee Poussin 1913: 66-67; La Vallee Poussin' 1928-1 929: 456-457. 411 T. 1579: 881 b 13. Not found in the Tibetan; see note 411 ."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"157 the Va stusalpgrahalJl would suggest that at least this portion of it412 is newer than portions of the Bodhisattvabhumi. Second, Funahashi, as I mentioned above, thinks that the order of the hetus in the Savitark?idibhumi is related to the order of the adhi�th?inas, and this certainly seems to be true. However, I have been unable to find any mention of fifteen adhi�th?inas earlier than this same discussion of hetu, . pratyaya, phala, and adhi�th?ina in the Savitarkadibhumi. Therefore, it seems probable to me that the association of the fifteen adhi�th?inas with the ten hetus did not prompt the rearranging of the list. Instead, I think, the influence of early Yogacara interpretations of the prafityasamutp?ida fo rmula led to both these fe atures of the Savitark?idibhumi passage. In the introduction to his translation of the exposition of pratltyasamutp?ida in the Abhidharmasamuccaya and its Bh?i�ya, Matsuda discusses the development of the Yogacara \"two­lifetimes/singlefold causation\" theory. Although the section on aizgasam?isa in the Abhidharmasamuccaya is the locus classicus of this theory, Matsuda suggests that the Yog?ic?irabhumi may contain its fo rerunners. There are several expositions of pratztyasamutp?ida in the Yo g?ic?irabhumi, and Matsuda deals with two in particular. Regarding the sarzra section of the Savitark?idibhumi exposition (Yog?ic?irabhumi: 198.1 7-203.5), which is also included in the Va stusarrzgrahalJl (Vastu­sarrzgrahalJz [tib.]: 'i 285a3-287b6; T. 1579: 827c3-828cI2), Matsuda disagrees with Vi Hakuju, who does not see it as similar to the two­lifetimes/singlefold causation theory. However, citing the difficulties in understanding this passage, Matsuda does not analyze it in depth. Instead he turns to an exposition in the Sr?ivakabhumi (Sr?ivakabhUmi: 384.6-385.5; Wayman 1961: 114; Sr?ivakabhumi [tib.]: 169b2- 170al; T. 1579: 454bI5-c1) that he says corresponds to it, in which two types of causes (?ik�epakahetu and abhinirvartakahetu, or abhinirvrttihetu) and two types of results (?itmabhavaphala and vi�ayopabhogaphala) are 412This last portion of the Va stusaJ?1grahaT,lI, unlike the majority ofthe text, is not a commentary on the SaJ?1yuktiigama; rather it consists of a miitrkii of abhidharma, and Mukai notes that it does not exist in Tibetan translation (1985: 6). This, and the fa ct that the portion iefers to the MaullbhUmi, suggests that it is a later addition to the Va stusaJ?1grahaT,lI."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"158 mentioned. According to this passage, the members from Consciousness through Feeling are the seeds in the present life of Birth in the future life (Matsuda 1983: 30-32). The siirira section from the SavitarkiidibhUmi in fact seems to present a very similar system, with certain slight differences in terminology (vipiikaphala for iitmabhiivaph�la; vi.Jayanirjiitafphala] for vi.Jayopabhogaphala; up apattyabhinirvrttihetu for abhinirvrttihetu) and perhaps a somewhat different mechanism of seed-causation. Establ.ishing the chronological sequence of these expositions is difficult. As I have mentioned above, Schmithausen thinks that the SriivakabhUmi, the Bodhisattvabhumi, and the Va stusar!1grahalJ-z belong to the earliest layers of the Yo giiciirabhumi (1987: 14). Since the sanra section of the Savitarkiidibhumi exposition appears (without the heading sanra) in the Va stusaJ?lgrahalJ-z, the most natural assumption might be that it was borrowed by the Savitarkiidibhumi to serve as the first of its nine sections. If this is the case, then the sarzra section, unlike the remainder of the exposition, is very early. However, Mukai has shown that, while much of the Va stusaJ?lgrahalJ-1 is in effect a commentary on the SaJ?lyuktiigama, the part corresponding to the Savitarkiidibhumi sarzra section is not (1985: 34). On the other hand, it does not seem likely to me that this section originated as late as the composition of the Savitarkiidibhumi and was interpolated from the Savitarkiidibhumi into the Va stusaJ?lgrahalJ-z. On the contrary, its rather disorganized contents suggest to me an early date of composition; in fact, its greater length and lack of clarity make it seem older than the Sriivakabhumi exposition, even though the Sriivakabhumi is generally considered to be earlier than the Va stusaJ?lgrahalJ-l, let alone the Savitarkiidibhumi. Although Schmithausen refers to this passage and mentions the fact that it appears in both the Va stusaJ?lgrahalJ-1 and Savitarkiidibhumi, he does not . speculate on where it was first incorporated (1987: 38, 48, 170). Therefore, the origin of this passage remains unclear, as does its chronological relation to the Sriivakabhumi exposition, at least to my mind. In any case, the Savitarkiidibhumi sarlra section and its Va stusaJ?lgrahalJ-1 parallel are probably considerably older than the remainder of the Savit�rkiidibhUmi exposition, while the Sriivakabhumi ,"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"159 passage is undoubtedly so. Thus, we can find the terms Cik�epa (Cik�epaka) and abhinirvrtti (abhinirvartaka) occurring with essentially similar meanings in the several systematic expositions of the pratztyasamutpCida forrrtuia contained in the Yo gCicCirabhumi. As we shall see, they also are found in the fully developed two-lifetimes/singlefold causation system of the . Abhidharmasamuccaya. However, there seems to be some development over the course of time. In certain passages (the expositions in the SrCivakabhumi and the Va stusarrzgrahar.zz, as well as the sarzra section of the SavitarkCidibhumi), the terms are mentioned as part of an explanation of the process of conditioned origination, while in others (the pratyayatva section of the SavitarkCidibhumi and the angasamCisa section of the Abhidharmasamuccaya), they appear as the headings of groups under which the members of the formula are enumerated. On the basis of this, I think that the Yogacara explanation of the prantyasamutpCida formula in terms of a theory of seed callsation is in the process of being worked out in the earlier passages, while the later passages simply describe the implications of a theory that has already been more or less systematized. How then are the Cik�epakahetu and abhinirvrttihetu (or abhinirvartakahetu) of the prat'ityasamutpCida expositions related to Cik�epahetu and abhinirvrttihetu in the list of the ten hetus? I shall attempt to show a sequence of ideas and texts, but given our lack of certainty regarding the chronology of the Yo gCicCirabhUmi texts, my conclusions must be largely speculative. The earliest interpretation of the pratZtyasamutpiida formula containing the idea that actions performed under the influence of Ignorance condition rebirth, not by. directly causing Consciousness to arise in the next life, as in the Sarvastivadin three-lifetimes/twofold causation system, but by \"planting\" a seed that can become actualized in the form of the next life, is perhaps found in a passage from Chapter Six of the Dasabhumikasutra.413 Although this passage does not contain the 4l3te�iil?'l tai� sal?'lskiirai� paribhiivitam [omitted by Rahder (1926: 48) and La Vallee Poussiri (1913: 116), but supported by Dasabhftmikasfttra [tib.]: Ii 102b2]"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"160 terms ak$epahetu and abhinirvrttihetu, its approach is more similar to that of the Sravakabhumi and sar'ira expositions than to that of the Sarvastivadin interpretation of the prat'ityasamutpada formula, and the botanical metaphor that is elaborated on in the Bodhisattvabhumi discussion of the ten hetus seems to originate here. Both the Sravakabhumi and the sar'ira expositions seem to be attempts to explain more systematically the process described in the DasabhUmikasutra, and both expositions take the term bija in a more technical sense. Although we do not know which is earlier, the sar'ira exposition as found in the Va stusa'!lgraha1}'i, or the Sravakabhumi, I believe that, in the course of determining exactly how the members of the fo rmula function in causing rebirth, one of these two texts introduced the terms ak$epahetu414 and abhinirvrttihetu (or abhinirvartakahetu). If I am correct then, the ten-hetus passage from the Bodhi­sattvabhumi, in which the. description of how the hetus function in a botanical context clearly recalls the language of the Dasabhumika-avaropita1j1 cittabija7!l siisrava7!l sopiidiinam iiyatyii7!l jiitijariimaraf}apunarbhavii­bhini[r]*vrttisa7!lbhavopagata7!l bhavati I karmak�etriilayam avidyii7!ldhakiiran tr�f}iisneham asmimiinapari�yandina7!l dT$fikrtajiilapravrddhyii niimarupiinkurab priidurbhavati (Dasabhumikasutra: 97.3-6). *Rahder and La Vallee Poussin clearly provide a better reading here. With regard to the question of when explanations of the pratztyasamutpiida fo rmula in terms of seeds fi rst appeared, Aramaki cites a sutta from the Sa7!lyuttanikiiya, according to which the body's development, depending on causes, is similar to a plant's development from a seed that has received \"earthly nutrients\" (Aramaki's translation) and water (nayida7!l attakata7!l bimba7!l n ayida7!l parakatam agha7!l I hetu7!l paficca sambhiita7!l hetubhangii nirujjhati II yathii afifiatara7!l bija7!l khette vutta7!l viriihati I pathavzrasam ciigamma sinehaii ca tad ubhaya7!l-as given in Aramaki 1986: 118). This, of course, is an earlier example of a botanical simile in a discussion of causation, and the basic metaphor may have originated in this or some even older text. However, this sutta, if I understand Aramaki correctly, precedes the emergence of the pratltyasamutpiida formula as we know it. The very detailed application of the metaphor to the formula in the Bodhisattvabhiimi strikingly resembles that of the Dasabhiimikasiitra. Although the two texts may have a common source, it seems likely to me that the author of the Bodhisattvabhiimi was familiar with the Dasabhiimikasiitra passage. 4141 do not think that there is any substantial difference in meaning between iik�epa and iilqeptika in these compounds."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"161 sutra,4J5 borrows the terms iik�epahetu and abhinirvrttihetu from one of the early pratztyasamutpiida expositions found in the Yogiiciirabhumi.

The main diff erences between the Bodhisattvabhumi definitions and those of the sarzra exposition involve the mention of the seeds of Ignorance in the former. Both the sarzra418 and the Sriivakabhumi419 passages iJ;1clude seeds in ii�epakahetu, but only the seeds of the members fr om Consciousness through Feeling; Ignorance and the Karmic Forces are not described as seeds.

Again, the seeds of Ignorance are not mentioned; however, the Bodhisattvabhumi, like the sarzra exposition, defines abhinirvrttihetu as the seeds of the constituents of the next life in a state of readiness to yield results.

Furthermore, the fact that another hetu, parigrahahetu, comes between ak�epa-and abhin irvrttihetus suggests that at the time of the composition of the Bodhisattvabhumi list the expositions of pratitya­samutpada in the Yo gacarabhumi were not yet established as the standard Yogacara explanations of the formula, and thus a�epahetu and abhinirvrttihetu were not yet an inseparable pair. The botanical origin of the seed metaphor, which lingers in the Bodhisattvabhumi description of external causality, perhaps still overrides the more abstract theory of causality found in the expositions of pratltyasamutpada. After all, in the physical process whereby a seed gains the potential to yield fruit, auxiliary causes such as water clearly work their results after the planting of the seed in its \"unmoistened\" state and before its fructification, and the Bodhisattvabhumi devotes considerable space to describing this process. In contrast, the ten-hetus passage in the Savitarkadibhumi does not refer to botanical development at all; in fact, it scarcely mentions the external world.421 As seed theory was refined, the original metaphor may have lost its force, and even in texts as early as the Sravakabhumi, the term bija seems somewhat divorced from the botanical setting. By the time of the Savitarkadibhumi (here I exclude the sarira section on the grounds that it was probably borrowed wholesale from an earlier source), there has been even further movement away from the original meaning, and the ' remainder of the extensive treatnient of pratftyasamutpada found at the end of the Savita rkadibhumi represents a later stage in the systematization of bija theory. Unlike the exposition of sarira, which is convoluted and repetitive, the rest of the Savitarkadibhumi analysis is written in a straightforward abhidharma style, full of definitions and 421For example, in its explanation of iilqepahetu, the Savitarkiidibhumi simply states: biihyiiniirrz ca bhiiviiniirrz tenaiviidhipatyena sampannavipannatii (Yogiiciira­bhumi: 108.2-3).

The pratyaya section, for example, in explaining the types of causal relations the various members of the formula can enter into with one another, states that one member cannot be the causal condition (hetupratyaya) of another because the causal condition of something is . always the seed of that same thing.423 The terms iik�epahetu and abhinirvrttihetu come up in further discussion of this point. Here the two, as they occur in the list of ten causes,424 are related specifically to the pratityasamutpiiia formula: ii�epahetu consists of the members from Ignorance through Feeling, while abhinirvtttihetu consists of the members from Subconscious Desire through Karmic Existence.425 In the course of showing the connection between the four pratyayas and the twelve members of the formula, this brief passage in effect summarizes the lengthy descriptions of iik�epakahetu and up apattyabhinirvrttihetu from the sarira exposition and equates the two with the ii�epahetu and abhinirvrttihetu of the ten-hetus system. By this point, the bija interpretation of the formula is so well established that here, unlike in the Sriivakabhumi and sarira expositions, the fact that the members fr om Individual Existence through Feeling are in the form of seeds rather than actualized dharmas is not even mentioned, a feature this passage shares with the aftgasamiisa section of the Abhi­dharmasamuccaya.

Bence, it is not surprising that,earlier in the Savitarkiidibhumt, in the discussion of the ten hetus, the order of the Bodhisattvabhumi list has been changed to bring iik�epahetu and abhinirvrttihetu together. Furthennore, the definition of the causes in tenns of the adhi�thiinas, upon which Funahashi remarks, places more emphasis than the Bodhisattvabhumi on the relationship between the two types of causes in the rebirth process .. Ak�epahetu is to be understood in tenns of the adhi�thiina of perfuming (viisanii) because the Kannic Forces, perfumed by good or bad kanna, project new lives in desirable or undesirable existences,426 while abhinirvrttihetu is to be understood in tenns of the adhi�thiina of the moist seed (siibhi�yandabija) because the seed, moistened by Subconscious Desire, results in the actualization of the projected new lives.427 \\V.'ith the exceptions of the VinscayasarrzgrahaIJI and the Chiieh ting tsang fun, both of which refer the reader to the Bodhisattvabhumi exposition without enumerating the causes themselves, all discussions of the ten hetus that I have found in texts later than the VastusarrzgrahaIJI follow the order of the Savitarkiidibhumi. Furthennore, the Ch ' eng wei shih fun, although it contains two different explanations of a discrepancy between the Bodhisattvabhumi and Savitarkiidibhumi regarding jana­kahetu and upiiya hetu in which iik�epahetu and abhinirvrttihetu figure prominently,428 does not mention the difference between these two texts regarding the order of the hetus.

After this point, while there was 'no further evolution in the exposition often hetus, the Yogiid:ira interpretation of pratztyasamutpiida was brought to yet a higher level of systematization in the Abhidharmasamuccaya. As we have seen, the Abhidharma­samuccaya explains the formula in terms of four sets of members: that which proj ects (iik�epakiinga : Ignorance, the Karmic Forces, and Consciousness) and that which is projected (iik�iptiinga: Individual Existence, the Six Senses, Contact, and Feeling) at the time of cause, and that which actualizes (abhin irvartakiinga: Subconscious Desire, Appropriation, and Karmic Existence) and that which is actualized (abhinirvrttyanga: Birth and Old Age and Death) at the time ofresult.429 d. The Yo giiciira Source of Vasubandhu's Up apattihetu and Abhinirvrttihetu As we saw earlier, Vasubandhu referred to an as yet unidentified sutra to show that tr�1'}ii is the cause of rebirth in general (abhi­nirvrttihl!tu), while karma is the cause of the specific rebirth (upapatti­hetu). The same sutra passage (karma hetur up apattaye / tr�1'}ii hetur abhinirvrttaye) is quoted at the end of the explanation of abhinirvrtti­hetu in the Savitarkiidibhumi exposition of the ten hetus summarized in the preceding section (Yogiiciirabhumi: 108.10). Although the Savitarkiidibhumi does not explicitly identify up apattihetu with iilqepahetu, iilqepahetu, like up apattihetu, is essentially karma, albeit in the form of bija or viisanii. Furthermore, the quotation appears to be used in the Savitarkiidibhumi passage to justify not only the category of abhinirvrttihetu, but of iik�epahetu as well.430 The Savitarkiidibhumi, 429Abhidharmasamuccaya: 26.6-9; Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya: 31.9-32.3. see Chapter Two, section B3. 43\"This passage recognizes a distinction between upapatti and abhin irvrtti that is not made in the sarlra portion of the exposition of pratltyasamutpiida in the Savitarkii­dibhiimi. See note 205."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"166 like Vasubandhu, cites the sutra to show the special role of tr�1Jii in the rebirth process: tr�1Jii moistens the seed, and the moistened seed results in the actualization of the projected iitmabhiiva. I have suggested in the previous section that the Savitarkiidibhumi exposition of the ten hetus, like the majority of its pratityasamutpiida exposition (excluding the sarira section), reflects a highly systematized doctrine of seed causation. We have seen that the less systematized sarira section uses the word up apatti in the compound upapattya­bhinirvrttihetu simply as a synonym of punarbhava, with no special reference to seeds. The ten hetus exposition, on the other hand, by quoting from a sutra that contrasts up apatti with abhin irvrtti, emphasizes the twofold process that constitutes seed causation. Our discussion of tr�1Jii began with the controversy about whether tr�1Jii alone comprises samudayasatya. On the basis of the Yo giiciirabhumi analyses of pratityasamutpiida and the ten hetus, we must conclude that in the Yogacara system tr�1Jii cannot be solely responsible for dul}kha because abhin irvrttihetu is not the only causal process involved; iik:fepahetu, which is equivalent to karma, is also necessary. This is what Vasubandhu suggests in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, although, in the context of samudayasatya, he avoids using the term bija in a technical sense and does not mention iik�epa. Again, I believe that Vasubandhu adopts a position, this time the Vaibha�ika insistence that all siisravadharmas comprise samudayasatya, because it can be more easily reconciled with Yogacara doctrine than its alternative. Elsewhere, in his discussion of iihiira, Vasubandhu uses the terms iik�epa and abhinirvrtti in the same sentence to analyze the process of rebirth: \"Projection of a new existence is due to mental volition; actualization of that which is projected, moreover, [arises] fr om the seed of consciousness, which is impregnated by karma.

Mental volition, identified by Yasomitra as karma, corresponds to sa1!1skiira in the Yo giiciirabhumi passages and to vijfiiina (understood as karmabija) in the Abhidharma­samuccaya. The seed of consciousness corresponds to the seeds of vijfiiina through vedanii (or, in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, niimarupa through vedanii). Actualization corresponds to jiiti. Only the cause of actualization is not mentioned here. However, Sarpghabhadra in his comment clarifies Vasubandhu's understanding of the relationship between tr�1:tii and the future life: \"Cetanii is projecting karma. Vijfiiina is bija. [They] bring about the future life. This means that, due to karma, one can project the existence of the two, niima and rupa, of the future. After karma has projected [niimarupa], tN1Jii, [by] moistening the seed of vijfiiina, is able to generate the iitmabhiiva, which consists of the niimarupa of the future existence. Thus it is said in the sutra, 'karma is the cause of up apatti; tr�1Jii is the cause of abhinirvrtti. \",432 This, of course, is the same sutra that is quoted by Vasubandhu and in the SavitarkiidibhUrni, and Sarpghabhadra equates iik�epahetu with upapattihetu, as I have done above. Vasubandhu is being more blatantly unorthodox than usual in this passage. He even inserts what I consider to be telltale Yogadira terms, iik�epa and [abhi]nirvrtti, into the verse.433 Therefore, it is the more surprising that Sarpghabhadra does not attack Vasubandhu for the reference to bija in this passage of the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya. On the other hand, P'u-kuang, as La Vallee Poussin notes, characterizes the passage as a Sautrantika explanation.434 But if he is correct, we 4J2.\\!;t�51�o P.t�flTo 51;g'l�o ��El3�itt o ��51'l*o t,tg=�o �1l!t51eo f: ��flo ���'l�t,tg!r;go itt�;M!.�o ���j;§o f:�;gj;§ (T. 1562: 511bI7-20; Kokuyaku Is saikyo Bidoo-bu 28: 268). 433dvayam anyabhaviilqepanirvrttyartharrz yathiikramam (Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 154.12; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 3: 125-126). 43�. 1821: 182b2-3.

Again, I think that Vasubandhu is advocating a Yo gacara position here, and it is not recognized as such because of the tradition that Vasubandhu was a Sautrantika and not a Yogacara when he wrote the Abh idharma­kosabhii�ya. We must still ask how aware the authors of early Yo gacara texts were of the contradiction between the sutra statement that t!�lJii is samudayasatya and the logical demands of their own system of causation. As far as I can tell, the earliest strata of the Yo giiciirabhumi do not reveal such an awareness. In the Sriivakabhumi, samudaya­satya is simply and explicitly defined, as it is in the sutras, as comprising the various types of t!�lJii.435 In the Va stusa\"f!lgrahalJI, although samudayasatya is mentioned in a number of contexts, there seems to be nothing to suggest that its scope must be larger than t!�lJii. Finally, I have found no detailed discussion of samudayasatya in the Bodhisattvabhumi.436 However, when one turns to later portions, particularly the Viniscayasa\"f!lgrahalJl and Savitarkiidibhumi, one can see clearly that the sutra definition has been reconsidered.

The Function of Tr�1Jii in the Abhidharmasamuccaya Returning to the exposition of prafityasamutpiida in the Abhi­dharmasamuccaya, we can, if we compare the functions of sarrzskiiriinga and tr�1Jiinga, identify a distinction similar to that between upapattihetu . and abhinirvrttihetu. As we have seen, the saJ?1.skiiras, which are identified with karma, determine the specific destiny into which beings are born, as well as being the cause of the seeds of future existence.447 Thus, they correspond closely to Vasubandhu's upapattihetu, which causes rebirth in specific circumstances (see section d above). Tr�1Jii, on the other hand, draws beings to existence in general; the term existence Uanman) here seems synonymous with abhin irvrtti. Tr�1Jii is thus the first step of the three-step process (designated as abhinirvartakiinga in the angasamiisa section) that leads to the actual production of the new life. It ensures that beings will not be released from saJ?1.siira in this life and must, therefore, be born again. Up iidiina, which Takasaki sees as corresponding to karma in the context of the pratityasamutpiida formula,448 affects their consciousness, so that the impressions of past karma contained therein will result in the appropriate rebirth. When these impressions are activated, all the karma that leads to rebirth, added up, as it were, at the last moment, is called bhava.449 Bhava , as the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya says, conveys beings immediately to the next existence.45o The main function of tr�1Jii in this section of the Abhidharma­samuccaya pratftyasamutpiida exposition is to act as abhinirvrttihetu, or as the most important constituent of abhinirvrttihetu, which is 447See Chapter 2, section 85b. 448This is in spite of the fact, which he recognizes, that up iidiina is formally klesa rather than karma (Takasaki 1987: 156- 158). T he Abhidh armasamuccaya includes up iidiina in the category of klesasarrzklesa (see Chapter 2, section 86). 4490r so Vasubandhu explains bhava in his comment on Abhidharmakosa III 28ab, where he presents his own understanding of pratltyasamutpiida: up iidiinapratyayarrz puna� paunarbhiivikarrz karmopaclyate / tad bhava� (Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 1 40. 15; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 86). 4S\"See Chapter 2, section 85j."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"173 completed by up iidiina and bhava. This becomes clear by comparison when one looks at the 'explanation of the fu nctions of these three members in the Dasabhumikasutra. Chapter Six of the Dasabhumika­sutra, I believe, foreshadows various features ofYogaCiira expositions of pratltyasamutpiida but without formulating a consistent system. Although elsewhere in the chapter, as we have seen, one can find an explanation of pratltyasamutpiida involving seeds, the system of two types of cause, one that produces seeds and another that actualizes them, is not yet apparent. Nor does anything in the explanation of the functions in the Dasabhumikasutra suggest that vedanii and tr�1Jii belong to different lifetimes,451 or that vedanii is a seed, while tr�1Jii is an actualized dharma.452 Neither tr�1Jii nor upiidiina is related to rebirth at all; only bhava is said to establish the destiny of the new birth,453 a function assigned by the Abhidharmasamuccaya to sarrzskiira. The angakarmavyavasthiina section of the Abhidharmasamuccaya thus seems to be a rewriting of the corresponding passage from the Dasabhumikasutra in the light of the fully developed two-lifetimes/ singlefold causation system. In the case of tr�1Jii, the function described in the Dasabhumikasutra, namely to bring about desire for desirable 451 However, in the portion of Chapter Six of the Dasabhumikasutra in which the members are assigned to the past, present or future, vedanii and tr�lJii are assigned to different lifetimes (see Chapter 3, section 8), � 452The Ch 'eng wei shih [un says that the members from vijiiiina through vedanii, although they are seeds and simultaneous, are always mentioned in the traditional sequence, either due to the relative importance of each member, or because when they are actualized, they appear in this order (��.lifj:EI3�IUU�$nfl11l *o ffii1R.3:.1t1t.llUJlY1 %W.ffi.�g� •• m •• od1R.*ffl��&�*.�m� •• o El3M�.�mffl 1TW*�l!!Iiffl1T;Jt�-T. 1585: 43cl l-14; Shindojoyuishikiron: 355; La Vallee Poussin 1928-1929: 483).

While this seems to be accurate with respect to the Abhidharma­samuccaya, I think that the Dasabhumikasiitra, in fact, represents them as actualized dharmas because it has not yet taken the step of considering them to be bfjas.

Introduction 175 The definition of Consciousness as a member of the pratltya­samutpiida formula, that is, of sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijiiiinam, is crucially important to all interpretations of the principle of conditioned origination, and in any technical discussion of the formula, the treatment of vijiiiina sheds light on the fundamental doctrinal stance of the author. In this chapter, I show how early Yogikiira authors reject the traditional Sarviistiviidin definition in favor of a sidra definition that they can reinterpret according to their characteristic doctrine of iilayavijiiiina. Three possible definitions of Consciousness as a member of the formula concern us here. Does vijiiiiniinga consist of the six vijiiiina­kiiyas, i.e., visual consciousness (ca�urvijiiiina), and the other five? Is it pratisarrzdhivijiiiina, the exclusively mental consciousness (manovijiiiina) at the moment of conception? Or is it iilayavijiiiina? Of these three, the six-vijiiiinakiiya definition appears in the two versions of the Pratityasamutpiidasutra mentioned above (T. 99: 85a26-28; T. 124: 547c6-8), as well as in the Tibetan translation of the Pratztyasamutpiidiidivibhiiganirdda (de Jong 1979: 147). Furthermore, an explanation, with reference to the process of cognition, of how the six vijiiiinas� are conditioned by sarrzskiira is also given as one of a number of interpretations of sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijiiiinam in the Dharmaskandha, an early Sarviistiviidin abhidharma text.457 In a later 457ap i khalu cak�u� pratftya riipiilJicotpadyate cak�urvvijfiiina1!l (I ) tattra cak�u�sa1!lskrta1!l riipiilJi ca biihya1!l pratyaya1!l cak�urvvijfiiinasya tad ucyate sa1!lSkiir[ a ](pratyayarp vijfiiinam 1 ) srottraghriilJajihviikiiyamana� pratftya dharmmii1!ls cotpadyate manovijfiiina1!l (I ) tattra mana�sa1!lSkrta1!l dharmmiiS ca biihya1!l pratyaya1!l manovijfiiinasya tad ucyate sa1!lSkiirapratyaya1!l vijfiiina1!l (Dietz 1984: 31.5-1 2). 1£*IllN.

Vasubandhu, without personally subscribing to it, presents the best known version of the pratisarrzdhivijiiiina interpretation in the verses of the Abhidharmakosa, This, as I shall show, is the orthodox interpretation of the Sarvastivadin school from the period of the Vibhii$ii. In reaction to this interpretation, Vasubandhu in the Abhidharmakosabhii$ya insists that vijiiiiniifzga consists of the six vijiiiinakiiyas in the intermediate existence. His reason for rejecting the pratisarrzdhivijiiiina definition is, I believe, that it cannot be rationalized in terms of Yo gacara doctrine while the six-vijiiiina definition can. Finally, the explicitly Yogacara interpretation of sarrzskiira­pratyayarrz vijiiiinam is that it must be iilayavijiiiina. This is Vasu­bandhu's ultimate position in the Pratity asamutpiidavyiikhyii, and it underlies, I believe, his discussion in the Abhidharmakosabhii$ya, although it is by no means explicitly stated there. In the beginning of this chapter I examine Vasubandhu's various interpretations, an understanding of which may help clarify the explanation of the two functions of vijiiiiniinga in the Abhidharmasamuccaya. B. Vasubandhu on Sarrzskiirapratyayarrz Vijiiiinam 1. What was Vasubandhu's Own Opinion? In Chapter Three of the Abhidharmakosa, Vasubandhu devotes nineteen verses (v. 20-38) to a discussion of pratityasamutpiida. In the course of this discussion, we can find two conflicting definitions of consciousness as a member (afzga) of the pratityasamutpiida formula, that is to say, of consciousness conditioned by the karmic forces (sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijiiiinam). In verse 21 c, consciousness is defined as the skandhas at the moment of conception.458 In his comment in the Abhidharmakosabhii$ya on verse 28ab, however, Vasubandhu states that 45'sal?1dhiskandhas tu vijiianam (Abhidharmakosabha�ya: 131.26)."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"177 saf!'lskiirapratyayaf!'l vijiiiinam actually refers to the continuity of consciousness that goes to the various destinies by way of the antariibhava, which serves as a connection, and he cites a sutra definition for support.459 Although Vasubandhu does not explicitly mention pratisarrzdhivijiiiina, his commentators, as we shall see, infer the inclusion of this moment of consciousness in his defmition. In his translation of the Abhidharmakosa, La Vallee Poussin does not mention which school accepts the second definition. In his translation of the Ch 'eng wei shih [un, on the other hand, La Vallee Poussin attributes it to Sarvastivada (1928-1929: 200). Jaini makes the same attribution in the introduction to his edition of the Abhidharma­dfpa: \"The other [i.e., not pratisaf!'ldhivijiiiina] meaning, viz., the six vijiiiinas, although occurring in the Vibhanga-sutta of the Saf!'lyutta­nikiiya, is most probably a later addition introduced by the Abhi­dharmikas. This becomes evident from the attempt of the Vaibha�ikas to apply this term not only to the moment of rebirth consciousness, but also to a long preceding period called antarii-bhava, where alone the six vijiiiinas could be understood to function\" (1977: 58-59). More recently, Mejor has introduced a translation of the comment in the Abhidharma­kosabhii�ya on Abhidharmakosa III 28jib, together with the text and translation of the corresponding portion of Sthiramati's commentary, Ta ttviirtha, as \"Vaibhii�ikas on the prafityasamutpiida\" (1991: 96), thus indicating that he, too, considers the six-vijiiiinakiiya definition to represent the Sarvastivadin position. Samtani has pointed o,ut that the Arthaviniscayasutranibandhana identifies another interpretation of the six-vijiiiinakiiya definition, in which the six vijiiiinas are described as saf!'lskiiraparibhiivitii�, as a 459karmiik�epavasiic ca vijfi.iinasaTfltatis tiiTfl tiiTfl gatiTfl gacchati / jviiliigamana­yogeniintariibhavasambandhiit / tad asya* saTflskiirapra(vayaTfl vijfi.iinam / evaTfl ca lq-tvii tad up apannaTfl bhavati vijfiiiniinganirdeie \"vijfiiinaTfl katamat / �a4vijfiiinakiiyii\" iti (Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 140.2-4; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v, 2: 84-85), Following the suggestion of Muroj i Gijin (personal communication), I have emended tad anya to tad asya on the basis of the Tibetan translation de ni, 'di 'i 'du byed kyi rkyen gyis rnam par ses pa yin no (Abhidharmakosabhii�ya [tib,]: gu 15Ib6).

Among Japanese scholars, Yamaguchi and Funahashi describe the section of the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya in which this definition is found as \"Vasubandhu's Twelve-membered Conditioned Origination\" (1955: 230), thus indicating that it does not represent Sarvastivada doctrine. Furthermore, Kat6 shows that Vasubandhu, in his comment on Abhidharmakosa III 28ab, is actually attacking the Sarvastivadin iivasthika interpretation of pratztyasamutpiida. According to Kat6, Vasubandhu makes this attack in the name of the Sautrantika (1989: 315-317). However, Kat6 too does not explore Vasubandhu's interpretation of vijiiiina in detail. In this section, I hope to show that the first of these two defInitions (saT(ldhiskandhiis tu vijiiiinam) represents the orthodox Sarvastivadin position, while the second (vijiiiinaT(l ka tamat/ �a4vijiiiinakiiyii�) is Vasubandhu's own opinion. I shall also try to explain the implications of Vasubandhu's position. 2. The Sarvastivadin DefInition: PratisaT(ldhivijiiiina Since the exposition of conditioned origination in the Abhidharmakosa is rather involved, I shall fIrst explain the context in which each definition occurs. In the beginning of Chapter Three, the Exposition of the Universe (Lokanirdesa), Vasubandhu enumerates the various realms, destinies, etc., into which beings are reborn, and he explains antariibhava, the intermediate existence between death and rebirth. He then denies that there is any soul (iitman) that is reborn; rather, \"the skandhas alone, conditioned by defilement and action, enter the womb by way of the series (that is given the name) of the intermediate existence, like a lamp.,,461 To explain this conditioning 460Thls is Vasubandhu's position in another text, the Prafityasamutpiidavyiikhyii; see below, section B4. , 461niitmiisti skandhamiitraTfl tu kleSakarmiibhisaTflslq-tam / antariibhavasaTfltatyii kulqim eti pradipavat (Abhidharmakosa III 18; Abhidharmakosabhii�y a: 129.7 ff.; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 57)."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"179 process, whereby defilement and action result in rebirth, and birth in turn results in defilement and action, Vasubandhu introduces the topic of pratityasamutpiida.

In Abhidharmakosa III 20, Vasubandhu states that the twelve members of the pratztyasamutpiida formula can be divided among three lifetimes, and, in Abhidharmakosa III 21-24, he defines each member as being a \"state\" (dasii or avasthii) of the five skandhas. However, in verse 25, using the word kila (\"as is said\"), he indicates that he personally disagrees with this interpretation, which he attributes to the Sarviistiviidin or Vaibhii�ika schoo1.462 It is among the verses that present the iivasthika interpretation that our first definition of vijfiiina is found. Thus, Vasubandhu himself has identified the first definition as . being that of Sarviistiviida. Furthermore, as I mentioned above, near the beginning of his comment on verse 28ab, he attacks the entire iivasthika interpretation, to which, he says, the Sautriintikas object, and he questions whether it accurately reflects the meaning of siitra. 463 Moreover, at the end of the same section, he again explicitly identifies everything contained in the iivasthika interpretation as Vaib�ika doctrine.464 Similar iivasthika interpretations of pratztyasamutpiida, including definitions of vijfiiiniinga resembling the one found in Abhidharmakosa III 21 c, can be traced to earlier Sarviistiviidin texts, although not to the earliest group. I have not fo und such interpretations in the Sarviistiviidin Abhidharmapitaka, either in early texts, such as the Dharmaskandha (A p'i ta mo fa yiin tsu tun �iiJ mj!��;¥'!J.EJ�), which contains extensive discussions of both sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijfiiinam and niimariip a-462iivasthikaIJ kile�!o 'yalfl (Abhidharmakosa III 25a; Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 133 .11; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 66 n. 5). 463atra tu sautriintikii vijiiiipayanti / kilfl khalv etii i�!aya ucyante yii yasye�!ir iihosvit sutriirthalJ (Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 136.16-17; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 75). 464sa eva tu vaibhii�ikanyiiyo yalJ purvam uktalJ (Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 140.25; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 88).

According to the Vibhii�ii's own interpretation, each member refers to the five skandhas at a different moment; this is clearly the same iivasthika system described in Abhidharmakosa III 21-24. The definition of vijiiiina in the Vibhii�ii, however, appears somewhat different at first glance. According to Hsiian-tsang's translation, vijiiiina is the pratisaf1'ldhicitta (hsii hsin *I,C,,), together with its accompaniment (chu pan f!:IJW), which the Kokuyaku Issaikyo explains as the remaining fo ur skandhas (T. 1545: 119a5; Kokuyaku Issaikyo, Bidon-bu, v. 8: 9 n. 19).

Nor, I think, is there any difference in meaning between this pratisaf1'ldhicitta and the saf1'ldhiskandhas of Abhidharmakosa III 21; according to the iivasthika system, the five skandhas at this point in the development of the new life can be called vijiiiina (or citta, since the terms are synonymous here t72 because vijiiiina is the predominant element. 473 Vasubandhu perhaps condenses the term pratisaf1'ldhi metri causa, and Ya somitra, judging fr om his comment on Vasubandhu's second definition,474 considers that saf1'ldhiskandhas refers to pratisaf1'ldhicitta.

The SaTflyuktiibhidharmahrdayadefines it as the present saTfltati (hsien tsai hsiang hsii IJ!1:E;f:�*.), which here seems to be equivalent to the five skandhas at the first moment of the present life, since the next member, niimariip a, is defined in the following way: \"that saTfltati, (after) it already (exists), and while the six iiyatanas are not completely differentiated, is called niimariipa.,,475 Dharmasri's Abhidharmahrdaya (or Abhidharmasiira-A p'i t'an hsin lun �ilJm�'L'iii) also agrees with the Vibhii�ii in maintaining that the twelve members of the pratityasamutpiida formula refer to twelve sets, or states, of the skandhas and that the formula should not be understood in terms of a single moment. Its definition of vijiiiina, on the other hand, is rather surprising; it states that vijiiiina is the chung hsin f£ 'L' (= bijacitta) produced by the previous member, saTflskiira.476 This would seem to support Mizuno Kogen's statement that Dharmasri's Abhidharmahrdaya sometimes contains doctrines that diverge from orthodox Sarvastivada (1961: 73). Although Willemen does not comment on it in his translation, this definition deserves further exploration, especially since the term chung hsin, or chung shih f£�, is a synonym for iilayavijiiiina in some vijiiaptimiitratiitexts (Nakamura 1975: 650). All of the abhidharma texts mentioned above define vijiiiiniinga as the initial moment of the present lifetime and as the karmic link between the past life and the present. In the Vibhii�ii, Upasanta's Abhidharma­hrdaya, and the SaTflyuktiibhidharmahrdaya, moreover, this vijiiiina cannot possibly be the six vijiiiinakiiyas because, as we discover from the defmitions of the following angas, the six sense organs are not yet present at the moment referred to as vijiiiina.

Thus, I have found no evidence that the Sarvastivadins, from the period of the Vibhii�ii, interpreted vijiiiiniinga as the six vijiiiinakiiyas in the intermediate existence,478 whereas there are a number of Vaibha�ika texts that present the iivasthika interpretation as orthodox.

He then mentions the differing opinion of a Sthavira PUl1,lasa, who adduces four reasons to prove that wh�tever is pratltyasamutpiida cannot be pratltyasamutpanna (Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 136.10-16; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 74). It is at this point that Vasubandhu attributes to the Sautrantikas the criticism of the iivasthika interpretation, mentioned above. According to the Sautrantikas, nothing like it can be found in the sutras. There follows an argument between the Sautrantikas and the Sarvastivadins concerning the authority and completeness of the sutra definitions of the members of the formula. In the course of this argument, the Sarvastivadins maintain·that these definitions are not complete and that their meanings are not c1ear.48! The Sautrantikas, who have the last word in this dispute, state that the sutra is actually complete,482 and they proceed to point out the logical flaws in the iivasthika interpretation: \"Why do you introduce something of a different kind [other than avidyii; i.e., the five skandhas] into [your definition of] avidyii? Although the five skandhas are found in these 'states,' only that [entity] whose existence or non-existence determines the existence or non-existence of some [other entity, i.e., the following member] can be established as a member.

The point of this argument seems to be that, if the members of the formula are defined as states of the skandhas, the arhat would still be ensnared in sarrzsiira, simply because he still possesses the skandhas. However, we know that the arhat is able to reverse the process of sarrzsiira precisely because he destroys the first member, avidyii. Thus, although he possesses the skandhas until his death, he does not produce the conditions for rebirth and the continuation of sarrzsiira. Vasubandhu next returns to the four points of PUI1).iisa, refuting the first of them, and then discusses the question of whether pratftya­samutpiida is asarrzskrta. This in turn leads into an etymological discussion of the term pratltyasamutpiida, which is followed by various opinions regarding the question of why the Buddha expressed the principle of conditioned origination in two ways: \"since this exists, that exists,\" and \"due to the arising of this, that arises.,,484 Finally, Vasubandhu offers his own interpretation of the formula. Kata has remarked that, although Vasubandhu rejects iivasthikapratftya­samutpiida in principle and treats the formula for the most part in terms of a theory of cognition (ninshikiron ���il£��), his definitions of vijiiiina, niimarup a, and the �aifiiyatanas are not inconsistent with an embryo-4R]iityantarasya tv avidyiiyiirrz kirrzkrtal; prak�epal; / yady api ca tiisv avasthiisu pancaskandhii vidyante yasya tu bhiiviibhiivayor yasya bhiiviibhiivaniyamaIJ tad eviingarrz vyavasthiipayitum / saty api ca pancaskandhake 'rhatal; sarrzskiirii na bhavanti pancaskandhahetukiil; / kirrz tarhi / avidyiihetukii eva / tathii pWJyiipu1Jyiinefijyopagarrz ca vijfiiinarrz [na bhavati]* tr�1Jiidayas ceti / yathiinirdda** eva sutriirthal; (AbhidharmakosabhiiD'a: 137.4-8; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 76). *This is missing in Pradhan's edition, but Shastri includes this (Abhidharmakosa & Bha�ya: 452.7), and I fo llow him on the basis of the Tibetan (Abhidharma­kosabhii�ya [tib .]: gu 149b2). **Pradhan gives yathiinirddam, which is ungrammatical.

While Vasubandhu does not define these members as states of the skandhas, he does trace the early development of the new being from its beginning as consciousness, karmic ally projected by the past life, through the appearance of the other three mental skandhas, together with riipaskandha (i.e., niimariip a), to the development of the six sense organs (�a¢iiyatana). However, as I have shown at the beginning of this section, Vasubandhu does not think that vijiiiina refers only to the moment of pratisarrzdhi consciousness; rather, it encompasses the series of vijiiiinas that continues through the intermediate existence and begins the next life.485 This interpretation of the definition from the Pratltya­samutpiidasiitra, which Vasubandhu quotes here,486 can be justified because, according to abhidharma, the sense organs are all present in the intermediate existence,487 and thus consciousness can include all six vijiiiinakiiyas. (It is to this rule of abhidharma that Jaini alludes in the passage quoted in section Bl above.) If, on the other hand, explains Ya somitra, the siitra had intended for vijiiiiniinga to refer exclusively to pratisarrzdhivijiiiina, it would have said, \"What is vijiiiina? Manovijiiiina,\" because, at the moment of conception, only manovijiiiina is present, not the other five vijiiiinas.488 Ya somitra then quotes from Abhidharmakosa III 42ac to support his claim that pratisarrzdhivijiiiina can only be manovijiiiina, a point on which Vasubandhu and Sarvastivllda agree (see Srup. ghabhadra's comment, quoted above at the end of section B2).

Although the moment of conception is only manovijiiana, in the state of the intermediate existence, [the stream of the vijiianas?] produces all six vijiianas.,,489 Then, after quoting Vasubandhu's approval of the definition of vijiiana in the Prafityasamutpadasiitra as the six vijiianakayas, P'u-kuang states, \"If one relies on the Sarviistiviidins, vijiiananga is only the single moment of up apattibhava and does not pass through the intermediate existence; therefore, (for them) it is only manovijiiana.,,490 Clearly, P'u­kuang believes that Vasubandhu disagrees with orthodox Sarviistiviidin doctrine. With the exception of the mention of Parsva in the Vibha�a, no interpretation of vijiiananga as including the consciousness of the intermediate existence can be found in the Sarviistiviidin abhidharma. Since Vasubandhu says very little by way of justifying his defmition, we must look elsewhere for explanations. Perhaps Sthiramati's comment on Vasubandhu's exposition of pratltyasamutpada in the Madhyantavibhagabha�ya can clarify Vasubandhu's reasoning in the Abhidharmakosabha�ya.

On the other hand, in his comment on Vasubandhu's explanation of vijiiiiniinga in the Tr irrzsikiibhii�ya, Sthiramati, although he does not use the term antariibhava, agrees with Vasubandhu's statement in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya that sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijiiiinam is located at least partially in the interval between death and rebirth. When Vasubandhu says that vijiiiina \"leads\" beings to, or causes them to obtain, rebirth,493 Sthiramati explains that the viisaniis, in the form of the seeds of rebirth, are led from death in the present life to rebirth in the next by means of the continuance of the stream of vijiiiinas that is impregnated by karma.494 Sthiramati then seems to say that this is proof that the vijiiiina of the previous life, and not the pratisarrzdhivijiiiina, is sarrzskiirapratyaya.495 492viUiiina iti atriilayavijfiiinam abhipretarrz na tu pravrttivijfiiinam (Madhyiintavibhiigatfkii: 29; Yamaguchi 1934: 36.15-16). 493navaniid vijfiiinenopapattisthiinasampriipar:ziit (Madhyiintavibhiiga: 28.12; Nagao 1964: 21.13-14). 494karmaparibhiivitena vijfiiinena santiinavrttyii cyuttisthiiniid upapapattisthiine punarbhavabijabhutiiyii viisaniiyiiJ:t priipar:zarrz nayanam (Madhyiintavibhiigatfkii: 29.21-22; Yamaguchi 1934: 7-9). 495tathii ca sati na pratisandhivijfiiinarrz sarrzskiirapratyayam purvakiilabhava­vijfiiinam eva sarrzskiirapratyayam iti pradarsitarrz bhavati (Madhyiint avibhiigatfkii: 29.23-30.1).

In our passage from the Abhidharmakosabhii-DJa, Vasubandhu does not use the term karmaparibhiivita, let alone iilayavijiiiina. But by including the consciousness of the intermediate existence in sarrzskiira­pratyayarrz vijiiiinam, he contradicts the unequivocal identification of vijiiiina with the present life that is prominent in the Sarviistiviidin iivasthika interpretation. And by doing so, he suggests that the nature of vijiiiina in the pratityasamutpiida formula is causal rather than resultant, as it would have to be if it were simply pratisarrzdhivijiiiina. 4. Vasubandhu's Definition in the Pratltyasamutpiidavyiikhyii: Sarrzskiiraparibhiivitarrz Vij iiiinam Like P'u-kuang, Viryasridatta, in a passage in the Arthaviniscaya­sutranibandhana, also draws attention to the difference between two defmitions of vijiiiiniiilga.496 The Arthaviniscayasutra itself contains the text of the Pratltyasamutpiidasutra and hence the six-vijiiiinakiiya Stcherbatsky 1978: 62) all disagree. Friedman probably comes closest to an accurate and intelligible translation, but he understands purvakiilabhava in a technical sense that is not, I think, justified here. Referring to the Abhidharmakosa, which defines purvakiilabhava as the skandhas between the moments of pratisarrzdhi and death, he explains the significance of our passage as fo llows: \"The sa!pSkaras condition not only the first moment of the new existence, i.e. the moment of reincarnation, but the whole existence, starting from the moment of conception up to death\" (1937: 127 ns. 62, 63). If Friedman is correct, sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijiiiinam is the vijiiiina of the present lifetime, from the moment of birth up until the moment of death. Friedman does not cite any other texts that define vijiiiiniinga in this way, nor do I know of any. Therefore, I think we should read snon gyi dus kyi srid pa 'i rnam par ses pa literally as \"the vijiiiina of the previous existence.\" In fact, the fo llowing sentence suggests that Sthiramati is arguing that the sarrzskiiras from the previous life, which no longer exists, cannot directly condition the vijiiiina of the present life (na hi vina�!iit [following Yamaguchi, instead of vina�!atviit] kiirar,ziit kiiryotpattir yujyate­Madhyiintavibhiigapkii: 30.1; Yamaguchi 1934: 37.12). 496This passage corresponds to a portion of the Pratltyasamutpiidavyakhyii, in which Vasubandhu quotes the view of an opponent whom he will soon refute (Honjo 1989: 173); Viryasridatta, on the other hand, seems to approve of this view."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"190 definition, but Viryasddatta, who, according to Mejor, follows the Kashmirian Vaibha�ikas (1991: 18), points out that elsewhere sarrzskiira­pratyayarrz vijiiiinam is identified with pratisarrzdhivijiiiina, and he quotes Abhidharmakosa III 21c (sarrzdhiskandhiis tu vijiiiinam). He also refers to the well-known siitra statement according to which niimariipa could not solidify into a fetus if vijiiiina did not descend into the mother's womb (Dlghanikiiya II 63; quoted in La Vallee Poussin 1913: 12) and understands it to imply that vijiiiina in the pratltyasamutpiida formula refers to pratisarrzdhivijiiiina and hence can only be manovijiiiina (Arthaviniscayasiitranibandhana: 118.2-6). Viryasridatta then points out the discrepancy between this interpretation and the definition in the Arthaviniscayasiitra, but he argues that there is no contradiction (virodha). According to him, the definition in the Arthaviniscayasiitra(i.e., that of the Pratltya­samutpiidasutra) is overly broad and ,not specific to the context of rebirth. Therefore, he says, it is not liik�Wlika. To support this assertion, he compares the siitra definitions of vijiiiina and the riipa portion of niimariipa and shows that, in the case of riipa, too, the siitra likewise gives an all-inclusive definition that does not pertain to the specific context of vijiiiinapratyayarrz niimarupam. Furthermore, he states that the lii�al}ika definition is to be found elsewhere, i.e., in the verse of the Abhidharmakosa that contains the iivasthika definition (Arthaviniscaya­siitranibandhana: 118.6-119.2). However, Viryasridatta is also able to rationalize the siitra definition; that is to say, he is able to understand it in the context of the pratltyasamutpiida formula. He mentions by name the Sautrantikas, who, he says, believe that the vijiiiina conditioned by the sarrzskiiras is not pratisarrzdhivijiiiina but rather the six vijiiiinas, which are permeated by the sarrzskiiras.497 This passage is significant because it is one of only two explicit attributions of a six-vijiiiinakiiya definition to the Sautrantikas 497 sautriintikamatena tv avirodha eva I yasmiit tasya sa1!lskiiraparibhiivitii!J �a4vijiiiinakiiyii!J sa1!lskiirapratyayarrz vijiiiinam i�!arrz na pratisarrzdhivijiiiinam eveti (ArthaviniScayasutranibandhana: 119.2-4; Honjo 1989: 67-69)."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"191 that I have found.498 However, the interpretation of the six vijiiiinakiiyas here as sal!lskiiraparibhiivita is not identical to Vasubandhu's interpretation in the Abh idharmakosabhii�ya, in which the term sal!lskiiraparibhiivita is not mentioned, whereas antariibhava is. Moreover, there are many passages in the Arthavin iscayasutra­nibandhana that correspond to Va subandhu's Pratltyasamutpiida-. vyiikhyii, including the first part of this one (Honjo 1989: 173), and it is perhaps to this text, and not to the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, that Vlryasridatta is referring when he mentions the opinion of the Sautrantikas in the above passage. In the Prafityasamutpiidavyiikhyii,499 Vasubandhu includes a long discussion of vijiiiiniinga,500 in which he mentions the view of certain \"others\" (gian dag) who maintain that sal!lskiirapratyayal!l vijiiiinam is the pratisal!ldhivijiiiina in the mother's womb (20b4-5; see above concerning the correspondence between this passage and the Artha­viniScayasutranibandhana). Schmithausen has identified a passage501 in which Vasubandhu refutes this view as being inconsistent with both sutra502 and reason (1987: 467 n. 1128).503 Among the several opinions that Vasubandhu attacks is the one quoted with approval in the Arthaviniscayasutranibandhana, namely that the pratisal!ldhivijiiiina definition is liilqalJika and the six-vijiiiinakiiya definition is iibhipriiyika, and that the siistra defmition, therefore, does not contradict the sutra \"'\"[he other occurs in the Tr i17lsikiirikii (quoted in Muroji 1993: 181 n. 297). \"'This text has been studied by Matsuda (1982a; 1982b), Muroj i (198S), and Schmithausen (1987).

On the basis of Muroji's work, as well as a personal communication, for which I am grateful, I have made a number of changes to the following section; however, he may still disagree with my understanding of Vasubandhu's position. sII°Prafityasamutpiidavyiikhyii [tib.]: 17aS -26bS; Muroji 1993: 144-201. sII'Prafityasamutpiidavyiikhyii [tib.]: 20b4 -22b4; Muroji 1993: 163-17S. s02mdo sde dan 'gal (Pratftyasamutpiidavyiikhyii [tib.]: 20b6-21 b8; Muroji 1993: 164-1 70).

Vasubandhu ridicules this position, saying that the two definitions are indeed irreconcilable. He shows that, in the case of the rupa portion of niimarupa, the sutra definition, namely that rftpa consists of the four mahiibhutas and the four up iidiiyarupas, and the siistra definition, presumably that rupa is the material portion of the embryo, are compatible since the embryonic rupa does, in fact, consist of the mahiibhutas and the up iidiiyarupas. In the case of vijfiiina, however, the six vijfiiinakiiyas are not present at the moment of conception, so siistra contradicts sutra.504 Instead, Vasubandhu here defmes sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijiiiinam as vijfiiina permeated by the sarrzskiiras.505 Schmithausen describes this vijfiiina as follows: \"The sarrzskiira-pratyayarrz vijfiiinam is the vijfiiina of the prior existence which receives the Impressions of karma and - by continuously propagating itself along with this impression - becomes, in its turn, the cause of a new existence (beginning with niimarupa)\" (1987: 253 n. 51). Vasubandhu rejects the Vaibha�ika assertion that the pratisarrzdhi­vijfiiina definitIon is lii�a1'}ika. However, he too, as Matsuda points out (1982b: 63-64), considers the six-vijfiiinakiiya definition in the sutra to be intentional: according to Va subandhu, sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijfiiinam is ultimately the stream of iilayavijiiiina permeated by the sarrzskiiras, due to the evolution of which rebirth can occur. When the sutra mentions the six vijfiiinakiiyas, it is really indicating the cause (iilayavijfiiina) by means of the result (the six vijfiiinas), the basis by 5114iiili mtshams sbyor ba na rnam par ses pa gali yin pa de rnam par ses pa 'i tshogs drug ma yin pas / 'dir chos 'dra ba ci yod / 'dir ni 'du byed kyi rkyen gyis rnam par ses pa bstan pa brtsams pa yin pas zfa fa ci 'i phyir bya (Pratltyasamutpiida­vyiikhyii [tib.]: 21a3-4; Muroj i 1993: 165; see also Wayman and Wayman 1974: 55 n. 58, where this passage is referred to; however, I am not sure whether the Wayman s understand it in the same way that I do). 5115de Itar na 'du byed kyis yolis su bsgos pa rnam par ses pa de iiid 'du byed kyi rkyen gyis yin gyi iiili mtshams sbyor ba'i rnam par ses pa ni ma yin no (Pratltya­samutpiidavyiikhyii [tib.]: 23al-2; Muroj i 1993: 176)."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"193 means of that which is based on it.506 Nevertheless, there is a difference in Vasubandhu's treatment of the two definitions. According to him, the first definition is simply wrong: as has been shown by scripture and by reason, saTflskiirapratyayaTfl vijiiiinam cannot be pratisaTfldhivijiiiina. The second definition, on the other hand, can be justified by the exegetical maneuver of claiming that when the sutra says \"the six vijiiiinas,\" it really means \"iilayavijiiiina.\" The remainder of Vasu­bandhu's section on vijiiiiniinga concerns iilayavijiiiina, a discussion that is similar to that found in the Karmasiddhiprakara1}a, yet another text by Vasubandhu (Matsuda 1982a: 44) . . C. Vasubandhu's Positions-Sautrantika or Yogacara? In all interpretations of pratztyasamutpiida in the context of rebirth, vijii iina is the most important member since it is exactly at vijiiiina that the karmic legacy of one life passes on to the next. However, as we have seen, different interpretations disagree regarding two interrelated issues: the stage in the rebirth process to which vijiiiiniinga corresponds; and its causal nature. To the question of whether vijiiiina is cause, result, or both cause and result, all possible answers have been proposed in one text or another during the history of the exegesis of the formula.507 As I have shown above, vijiiiina in the Sarvastivadin system refers 51)6 'dir don iiid gan ie na / 'du byed kyis yons su bsgos pa 'i kun gii rnam par ses pa 'i rgyun yons su gyur pas yan srid 'byun bar nus pa ni 'dir 'du byed kyi rkyen gyis rnam par ses pa yin par dgons pa yin no / gan yan 'di skad du rnam par ses pa drug' go ies gsuns pa ni gnas pa gnas bstan pa dan 'bras bus rgyu ste de dan ldan pa 'j rnam par ses pa 'i rgyun 'bab pa bstan pa 'j phyir ro (Pratltyasamutpiidavyiikhyii [tib.]: 24al-3; Muroji 1993: 182-183; Matsuda 1982b: 64).

There is some disagreement as to whether or not vijiiiina is vipiika. According to the Sarviistiviidins, it is .not vipiika because for them, pratisarrzdhi is always defIled,508 while vipiika must be morally neutra1.509 However, as Schmithausen has shown, pratisarrzdhi­vijiiiina is, in fact, considered to be vipiika in Theraviidin abhidharma, in the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya, and in parts of the Yo giiciirabhumi (1987: 38; 307 ns. 256-257). On the other hand, certain Yogaciira texts, for example, the Ch 'eng wei shih lun cr. 1585: 19a8; La Vallee Poussin 1928-1929: 217) and the Ma hiiyiinasarrzgrahabhii�ya (Lamotte 1973: 53-54), have adduced the defIled nature of pratisarrzdhivijiiiina as proof that it could not be sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijiiiinam, which, according t� them, must be vipiika and hence neutral. Regardless of the moral nature of pratisarrzdhivijiiiina, there is certainly nothing about it that suggests the strongly causal and projecting qualities of the six vijiiiinakiiyas, permeated by the sarrzskiiras, as described by Vasubandhu in the Pratityasamutpiidavyiikhyii. In the Pratityasamutpiidavyiikhyii, Vasubandhu locates vijiiiina in the prior lifetime. Furthermore, by calling it sarrzskiiraparibhiivita, he shows that, rather than being a resultant entity, projected by karma into the next life, it is a causal entity, the ability of which to project the next life is conditioned by karma. As for pratisarrzdhivijiiiina, it is the fIrst moment ofniimaropa in the present life.510 The general similarities between the explanations of pratitya­samutpiida in the Abhidharmasamuccaya and the Pratityasamutpiida­vyiikhyii have been noted by Matsuda (1982a: 47-48), and the sfl8upapattibhava� kli.na� (Abhidharmakosa III 38a; Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 151.19; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 2: 117-1 18). 5f19Vipiiko 'vyiikrto dharma� (Abhidharmakosa II 57a; Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 95.10; La Vallee Poussin 1971, v. 1: 289).

According to the Abhidharmasamuccaya, vijiiiina, which is considered a projecting (ii�epaka) member of the formula and hence belongs to the prior life, \"supports the bond of beings' actions\";Sll the Abhidharma­samuccayabhii�ya explains that this is ''because it arises simultaneously with the impressions produced by the Karmic Forces.\"s12 This seems to be the same function that is implicit in Vasubandhu's vijiiiina permeated by the sarrzskiiras. Furthermore, \"it is the condition of Individual Existence,\"513 because \"Individual Existence attains growth due to the entrance of consciousness into the mother's womb.\"s14 The consciousness mentioned here by the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya must be pratisarrzdhivijiiiina and, being associated with the later lifetime, cannot be the same as the vijiiiina that arises simultaneously with the karmic impressions. In the immediately following description of the function of niimariip a, which \"makes beings grasp the basis of personal existence,,,sls it becomes clear that, as in the Pratztyasamutpiidavyiikhyii, pratisarrzdhivijiiiina is identified with the initial moment of niimariipa. Thus, both the Abhidharmasamuccaya and Vasubandhu in the Pratztyasamutpiidavyiikhyii recognize two types of consciousness, a causal one, which is associated with the impressions of karma and which the siitra identifies provisionally with the six vijiiiinakiiyas, and a fruitional one, pratisarrzdh ivijiiiina, which is not considered . sarrzskiirapratyaya and which is associated with niimariipa.

Muroji [1985: 23] allows the nub of the Derge edition, upon which he bases his version, to stand in place of nus, which is attested in the Peking and Narthang editions). All of the editors and translators seem to rely on the commentary (Karrnasiddhi­prakaralJ.atikii) of Sumatisila, whom Anacker (1984: 85) dates to the late eighth century, in order to identify the proponents of the various arguments presented in the text. Even so, there remains considerable confusion regarding who is saying what and in answer to whom. In the case of the above passage, everybody agrees that it is either a Sautrantika statement (Lamotte 1936: 233; Muroji 1985: 23; Anacker 1984: 106) or Vasubandhu's comment on a Sautrantika position (Yamaguchi 1975: 162). However, their analyses of the surrounding text vary considerably (in the fo llowing, I refer to Lamotte's division of the text, which diffe rs from Yamaguchi's and Muroji's). According to Lamotte, section 20 is a statement of the Sautrantika theory of sarrztiinaparilJ.iirna. Section 21, in which the passage occurs, is a Sautrantika answer to a Vaibha�ika objection. Section 22 consists.of a Vaibha�ika statement that also mentions paribhiivitavijfiiina (kha cig na re t$he 'di fiid la des bsgos pa'i serns leyi rgyud rntshams 'byor pa las so ie na-KarrnasiddhiprakaralJ.a: 193.6-7) and that is questioned by someone, presumably Vasubandhu. According to Yamaguchi, section 20 and the first half of section 21 comprise the Sautrantika. statement of sarrztiinaparilJ.iirna, while the second half of section 21, beginning with the phrase '0 na ni gal te las nus leyan des bsgos pa 'i serns leyi rgyud las tshe phyi rna la 'bras bu 'byun na, quoted above, as well as section 22, are Vasubandhu's comment on the Sautrantika position, with which he disagrees. Yamaguchi identifies the kha cig in the statement kha cig na re tshe 'di fiid la des bsgos pa 'i serns Icyi rgyud rntsharns 'byor pa las so ie na as \"some among the Sautrantikas\"; although he does not so indicate, he relies here on the KarmasiddhiprakaralJ.at/kii for this identification (see Muroji 1985: 23 note a). According to Anacker, section 20 is Vasubandhu's opinion. Section 21 consists of the Vaibha�ika objection and a Sautrantika response. Section 22 consists of an interchange between Vasubandhu and certain Sautrantikas. Finally, Muroji agrees with Yamaguchi that section 20 and the first half of section 21 are the Sautrantika statement, but he also identifies the second half of 22 as the Sautrantika piirvapalqa, in which the view of another group of Sautrantikas is mentioned. Clearly the KarmasiddhiprakaralJ.a is a difficult text to make sense of, and it is probably not advisable to accept unquestioningly Sumatisila's identifications. Regardless of to whom the two references to paribhiivitavijfiiina are attributed, I have been unable to fi nd any references to karrnaparibhiivita-or sarrzskiira­paribhiivitavijfiiina among the texts (e.g., the Vibhii�ii, Tattvasiddhisiistra, and Ny iiyiinusiira) that are our sources for pre-Vasubandhu Sautrantika.

The relationship between this vipiikavijfiiina and niimarupa is explained in terms of the mutual dependence ofvijfiiina and niimariipa (Yogiiciirabhumi: 199.7-14). Schmithausen, who considers this passage to predate a systematized notion of iilayavijfiiina, emphasizes that both the causal and the vipiika consciousnesses here are the series \"consisting of one or the other of the ordinary six kinds ofvijfiiina\" (1987: 178). However, he does not suggest that it therefore represents a non-Yogacara (for example, a Sautrantika) doctrine. According to him, the earliest Yogacara thought, which he says is found in portions of the Yo giiciirabhumi, does not encompass a fully developed theory of iilayavijfiiina, explicitly identified as such. This raises the question of the development of Yogacara doctrine and its relationship to the Sautrantika school, a question that is very pertinent to the study of texts such as the Abhidharrnakosabhiirya and Abhidharma­samuccaya. Vasubandhu, whose name is associated with both the Sautrantika and Yogacara schools,-of course figures critically in any discussion of the relationship between them. There are many different opinions regarding Vasubandhu, especially concerning his dates and to how many people his name refers. Hirakawa summarizes the most commonly held views regarding Vasubandhu's philosophical beliefs: \"It is generally accepted among scholars that the author of the Kosa was ordained in the Sarvastivada School, but his thoughts were closer to those of the Sautrantika School. The doctrine of the Sautrantika School is based on 'the prajiiapti,' which includes the teaching of bija; therefore, the developed form of this doctrine can be related to the doctrine of Vijiianavada. It does not necessarily mean that the Sautrantika School itself developed into the Vij iianavada, but it can be easily assumed that the author of the Kosa belonged to the Sautrantika School [and] later changed to the Vijiianavada, for there is a certain common ground between the doctrines\" (1973-1978, v. 1: xi-xii). According to this way of thinking, Vasubandhu wrote the Abhidharmakosabhiirya when he was a Sautrantika, the Tr if!Z,§ikii when he was a Yo gacara, and texts like the Karmasiddhiprakaral}a and the Pratltyasamutpiidavyiikhyii at some time in between, while he was presumably in the process of conversion from Sautrantika to Yogacara.

This model ofVasubandhu's literary and philosophical development is largely based on two types of evidence: traditional accounts of his life and the contents of his writings. According to Mej or, the reliable information in the Chinese and Tibetan biographies and historical sources \"may be summarized in two points: (1) Vasubandhu's composition of the Abhidharmakosa-karikii and bhii:jya and a sub­sequent controversy with a Kashmirian Vaibha�ika master, Sailghabhadra, (2) Vasubandhu's conversion to Mahayana under the influence of his elder brother Asailga\" (1991: 7). As for the content of his works, it is well known that in the Abhidharmakosabhii:jya Vasubandhu frequently criticizes Vaibha�ika positions while supporting positions that he identifies as, or we know from other sources to be, Sautrantika. To summarize what Lamotte says about the Karma­siddhiprakarar:za (and this applies to works such as the Pratitya­samutpiidavyiikhyii as well), Vasubandhu, although he mentions iiZayavijiiiina, does not propose a doctrine of consciousness-only; furthermore, he quotes almost exclusively from non-Mahayana sutras, mentions the opinions mostly of non-Mahayana schools and teachers, and takes recognizably Sautrantika positions on a number of important issues (Lamotte 1935-36: 176-1 79). Finally, in the Tr irrzsikii, his exposition is clearly and classically Yogaciira. There may, however, be another way to explain why Vasubandhu asserts a \"Sautrantika\" position, at least in our case of sarrzskiira­pratyayarrz vijiiiinam. Before I come to this, it is necessary to discuss briefly two differing opinions regarding the composition of the Yo giiciirabhiimi, a text that precedes Vasubandhu and with which he was presumably acquainted.520 52·Concerning the question of the relationship between the Yogiiciirabhumi and the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, Yarnabe (1990) raises the possibility that Vasubandhu's bija theory can be traced back to the Yo giiciirabhiimi.

He goes on to identify three layers of the text: an oldest layer, in which there is no reference to iilayavijiiiina; a middle layer, in which there are occasional references to iilayavijiiiina, but no reference to the Sarrzdhinirmocana­sutra; and the newest layer, in which iilayavijiiiina is discussed in detail and the Sarrzdhinirmocanasutra is fu lly utilized (1987: 14). The assumption that underlies Schmithausen's view of the stratification of the Yo giiciirabhumi is that, roughly speaking, the less mention of iilayavijiiiina and the fewer references to Mahayana sutra there are, the older the layer. Aramaki Noritoshi, on the other hand, takes a different approach in determining the strata of the text.52I Aramaki agrees with Schmithausen regarding the portions comprising the oldest layer, but he takes issue with Schmithausen.'s identification of the other two layers. Aramaki locates some portions containing material fr om the Sarrzdhinirmocana and detailed treatments of iilayavijiiiina in the middle layer and some portions containing scant mention of iilayavijiiiina in the newest layer. According to Aramaki's theory, the middle layer of the Yo giiciirabhumi contains the Yogacara exposition of ultimate truth (paramiirthavyavasthiina), namely the doctrine of iilayavijiiiina, while the newest layer contains an exposition of provisional truth (sarrzvrti­vyavasthiina), which presupposes iilayavijiiiina theory.522 In this layer, Aramaki sees the origin of the Yogacara abhidharma. In the case of Vasubandhu's texts, as well as the Abhidharma­samuccaya and Mahiiyiinasarrzgraha, we are dealing with a different situation. All of these texts were written after even the newest layer of the Yo giiciirabhumi, and there is a greater possibility of there having 52JPersonal communication. 522This is not to say that iilayavijiiiina itself has ultimate reality (parini�panna­svabhiiva).

Furthennore, by the time these works were written, the doctrine of alayavijiiana had been considerably systematized. Nonetheless, Aramaki's distinction between paramarthavyavasthana and sarrzvrtivyavasthana can perhaps help us understand the intention of these texts. First, let us consider the Abhidharmasamuccaya and Ma hayana­sarrzgraha. The purpose of the Ma hayanasarrzgraha is specifically to expound the doctrine of alayavijiiana, or, to use Aramaki's tenninology, the Yogacara paramarthavyavasthana, and it contains systematic proofs and elaborations. The Abhidharmasamuccaya, on the other hand, while it occasionally mentions the tenn, does not expound alayavijiiana in detail. Rather, a philosophical system based on alayavijiiana having already been worked out, the author/compiler(s) of the Abhidharma­samuccaya have attempted to produce an abhidharma, a sarrzvrti­vyavasthana, consonant with, and supportive of, this paramartha­vyavasthana. In the case of the Abhidharmasamuccaya interpretation of the pratltyasamutpada fonnula, the two-lifetime system, in which the causal vijiiana of the past life projects the seeds of the present life, only makes sense if vijiiananga is really alayavijiiana. However, since the purpose is to explain the twelve-membered fonnula and not to prove the existence of alayavijiiana, the Abhidharmasamuccaya does not mention it by name. This is in contrast to Ma hayanasarrzgraha I. 33, where, as one of a number of proofs of alayavijiiana, it is stated that sarrzskarapratyayarrz vijiianam can only be alayavijiiana (Mahayanasarrzgraha [tib.]: 1-5.15-16; Lamotte 1973: 53). Similarly, although he eloquently expounds alayavijiiana and· vijiiaptimatrata in the Tr irrzsika, Vasubandhu is writing for different purposes in the Abhidharmakosabha�ya and Pratltyasamutpadavyakhya. The Pratltyasamutpadavyakhya is a commentary on a sutra,523 the subject of which, as its name suggests, is pratltyasamutpada, and Vasubandhu, in commenting on it, does not have to refer to vijiiaptimatra theory, even though he uses the tenn alayavijiiana.

Nor does his accepting on the level of \"intentional meaning\" the identification of vijiiiiniinga with the six vijiiiinas, a position associated by some (see above) with the Sautrantika school, while rejecting the Sarvastivadin identification of it with pratisarrzdhivijiiiina, prove that he is himself a Sautrantika, at least in the sense of accepting the doctrines of other teachers, such as Srilata, who are designated as Sautrantikas. In an article that explores a number of points raised by Kat6 (1989) about Sautrantika, Honj6 suggests the possibility that Vasubandhu was the proponent of a Mahayana Sautrantika doctrine, distinguishable from the \"orthodox,\" Hinayana Sautrantika of Srilata (1990). My own theory is that Vasubandhu espouses Sautrantika or Sautrantika-like ideas for the purpose of constructing Yogacara abhidharma; this is, perhaps, not so different from Honj6's proposal. Whether Vasubandhu is writing as a Mahayana Sautrantika or a cov-ert Yogacara\" by contrasting the abhipriiya of the sarrzskiiraparibhiivitavijiiiinas with iilayavijiiiina, he implies that, for him, the term iilayavijiiiina applies to a higher realm of truth than the six vijiiiinas. To return to the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, there is some question in my mind whether Vasubandhu's definition of sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijiiiinam in his comment on Abhidharmakosa III 28ab is substantially the same as his definition in the Pratityasamutpiidavyiikhyii. At first glance, they appear different. In the Abhidharmakosabhii�a, Vasubandhu does not use the expression sarrzskiiraparibhiivita to describe vijiiiina, and this expression, with its connotations of bija-theory, is one of the most striking features of his discussion in the Pratltyasamutpiidavyiikhyii. Although Sthiramati, in his subcommentary on the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, calls the stream of vijiiiinas in the intermediate existence karmaparibhiivita (Mejor 1991: 101-102), he may be, perhaps under the influence of what Vasubandhu says in the Pratltyasamutpiidavyiikhyii, reading too much into the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya. 524 More important is the fact that, in the 5241n the Madhyiintavibhiiga!ikii, Sthiramati likewise interprets vijiiiina as the stream of vijiiiinas, impregnated by karma, in the antariibhava (karmaparibhiivitena"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"203 Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, Vasubandhu, as I mentioned above, has been understood by his commentators to include pratisarrzdhivijftiina, along with the stream of the six vijftanas in antariibhava, in his defmition of sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijftiinam. This would seem to be inconsistent with the causal nature ascribed to vijftiina in the Prafityasamutpiidavyiikhyii as well as with the statement that pratisarrzdhivijftiina is the first moment of niimariip a in the later lifetime. However, the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya is again quite a different type of text from either the Tr irrzsikii or the Prafityasamutpiidavyiikhyii. Although in Abhidharmakosa VIII 40ab Vasubandhu claims to have presented an abhidharma system largely in agreement with the Vaibha�ika school,S25 it is well known that he rejects the Sarvastivadin position on many crucial points. Nevertheless, even if the author of the Abhidharmadipa is correct in assuming, as laini puts it, that \"the Kosa is not an authentic Vaibhashika treatise but only a mouth-piece of the Mahayanist Vasubandhu disguised as a Vaibhashika achiirya\" (1977: 129), Vasubandhu's intention in writing the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya is not explicitly to expound Mahayana, specifically Yogacara, doctrine, even less so than it is in the Pratityasamutpiidavyiikhyii or the Karma­siddhiprakarar;a. In the case of his discussion of pratityasamutpiida, Vasubandhu seems mostly concerned with undermining the Sarvastivadin iivasth ika interpretation and with promoting the Pratityasamutpiidasutra as scriptural authority. Having established in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, without using any suspiciously Yogacara terminology such as paribhiivita, that the sutra definition of sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijftiinam as consisting of the six vijftiinakiiy as is preferable to the Sarvastivadin definition, he is free to interpret this six­vijftiinakiiya definition in a more overtly Yogacara fashion in the vijiiiinena santiinavrttyii cyutisthiiniid upapattisthane punarbhavabijabhutiiyii viisaniiyiib priipaIJa1!l nayanam (Madhyiintavibhiiga!fkii: 29; Yamaguchi 1934: 37.7-9). mkiism!ravaibhii�ikan!tisiddh ab priiyo mayii 'y a1!l kathito 'bhidharmab (Abhidharmakosabhii�ya: 459.16-17; quoted by Mejor, who seems to take this verse to mean that Vasubandhu's own doctrinal standpoint agrees with that of the Vaibhii�ikas [1991 : 19])."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"204 PratltyasamutpJidavyiikhyii. It thus seems possible that Vasubandhu, in' . the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, is adjusting the abhidharma system so painstakingly worked out by the Vaibha�ikas in order to make it consonant with his Yogacara beliefs. In his introduction to the Abhidharmadfpa, Jaini identifies sixteen points on which the author of the Abhidharmadfpa attacks Vasubandhu for departing from orthodox Vaibha�ika doctrine. In a significant number of these cases, the \"Sautrantika\" position taken by Vasubandhu is either virtually identical to that of the Yogacara school (for example, regarding the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras) or, in Jain's words, \"foreshadows the theory of ii!q,ya-vijfiiina\" (1977: 110), for example, regarding the anusayas. Jaini draws attention to the fact that the Dipakara accuses Vasubandhu of being a vaitulika, i.e., accepting Mahayana, (see above; also 1977: 128), and, in a discussion of the controversy about �arviistiviida, states:. \"Although the main attack on the Sarvastivada comes from the Sautrantika Kosakara, the DIpakara's reference to the iilaya-vijfiiina and to the abhuta-parikalpita unmistakably shows that his real opponents were Yogachara-Vijiianavadins ... \" (1977: 121). However, Jaini takes the Dipakara's accusations as confirmation of the traditional, and still commonly accepted, assertion that Vasubandhu was a Sautrantika when he wrote the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya and later converted to Mahayana and Yogacara. I, on the other hand, would like to suggest that the DIpakara may have been right, that Vasubandhu, when he wrote the Abhidharmakosa­bhii�ya, may already have been a Yogacara, and that the \"Sautrantika\" views that he espoused provided a better abhidharmic infrastructure for the doctrine of iilayavijfiiina than did the Sarvastivadin positions that he attacked. I believe that what Vasubandhu says about sarrzskiira­pratyayarrz vijfiiinam in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya and the Pratltya­samutpiidavyiikhyii supports my speculation. D.

Here, I shall examine the Abhidharmasamuccaya exposition, particularly as found in the angakarmavyavasthiina section, as Yogacara abhidharma in its own right. Vasubandhu, in both the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya and the Pratitya­samutpiidavyiikhyii is working under certain restraints. In the case of the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya, he is commenting on his own, fairly faithful summary of Sarvastivadin abhidharma contained in his kiirikiis. Although he does not hesitate to criticize Sarvastivadin positions, he is not willing to state explicitly the Yogacara beliefs that, if my speculations in the last section are correct, he held even at the time of writing the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya. And, as I have mentioned, in the case of the Pratityasamutpiidavyiikhyii, he is commenting on a sutra, not writing an independent exposition, even though his commentary is lengthy and far-reaching. The author or compiler of the Abhidharmasamuccaya, on the other hand, is fr ee of these limitations. He is free to include uncamouflaged Yo gacara concepts and terms, even if sparingly. Furthermore, since the Abhidharmasamuccaya is not a commentary on some other text, it can and must stand as an independent work. Therefore, unlike the sarira section of the Savitarkiidibhumi pratityasamutpiida exposition, which seems to belong to an earlier stage of Yogacara thought, in which a preliminary theory of iilayavijfiiina is being worked out, and unlike Vasubandhu when he comments on the Pratityasamutpiidasutra, the Abhidharmasamuccaya does not mention the six vijfiiinakiiyas at all in connection with sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijfiiinam. Nor does it mention the view that pratisarrzdhivijfiiina is sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijfiiinam, since the purpose of the Abhidharmasamuccaya is not to criticize Sarvastivadin doctrine, as Vasubandhu does in both the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya and the Pratityasamutpiidavyiikhyii, but to expound Yo gacara abhidharma.526 The nature of Consciousness in the exposition of pratityasamutpiida 526It is interesting to note that the Dasabhiimikasiitra, when discussing the fu nctions of Consciousness, seems to be unaware of any but the S�rviistiviidin definition of vijiiiiniinga (see Chapter 2, section 8Sc)."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"206 in the Abhidharmasamuccaya is not stated explicitly. However, the comments in the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya on the functions of vijiiiina in the angakarmavyavasthiina section can help us understand the definition of vijiiiina that is implicit throughout the exposition of pratftyasamutpiida, most strikingly in the section on angasamiisa, where Consciousness is assigned to the projecting set of members.527 According to the Abh idharmasamuccayabhii�ya, Consciousness \"supports the bonds of action of beings\" because its arising coincides with the viisaniis deposited by the Karmic Forces (A bhidharma­samuccayabhii�ya: 32.17-18). This is tantamount to associating sarrzskiirapratyayarrz vijiiiinam with the bijas produced by karma. Thus, the first function of Consciousness, that of supporting karmic continuity, is accomplished by the projection of the seeds of the new rebirth. This function of Consciousness is the one that Sthiramati in his Tr irrzsikiibhii�ya argues cannot be performed by the six vijiiiinakiiyas since a pravrttivijiiiina is unable to' contain any sort of viisanii. 528 The second function of Consciousness, i.e., to serve as the condition of Individual Existence, is accomplished when Consciousness enters the womb and initiates the Individual Existence of the next lifetime; this moment is pratisarrzdhivijiiiina.529 The two functions of Consciousness thus straddle the border between two lifetimes as well as manifesting two aspects of iilayavijiiiina mentioned in the famous verse of the Tr irrzsikii: \"Among these [three transformations of consciousness,] the consciousness called iilaya is vipiika and contains all seeds.,,530 The first function is possible because Consciousness is sarvabijaka, the second because it is vipiika .

PRATITYASAMUTPADA AND THE CITTAVIPRAYUKTASA¥SKARAS A. Introduction Certain of the imports (artha) of conditioned origination appear to be connected with the group of nine or ten cittaviprayuktasa1!lskiiras that are associated specifically with the Yogiiciira school.s34 In this chapter, I examine the Yogiiciira treatment of the cittaviprayukta­sa1!lskiiras, particularly as it relates the dharmas in this category to aspects of causality. In doing so, I refer frequently to Vasubandhu, whose qpinions in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya appear to have been influenced not only by the tradition that can be traced back to the Diirl?tiintika of the Vibhii�ii, but also by the Yo giiciirabhumi. Under the category of artha, the Abhidharmasamuccaya enumerates eleven features of the relationship between cause and result, and the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya reiterates the importance of these features in the immediately following section, where it relates them to the fivefold profundity (giimbhlrya) of pratityasamutpiida. Vi and Suguro have examined the section on artha in the Savitarkiidibhumi of the Yo giiciirabhumi, which appears to be the basis of the Abhidharma­samuccaya treatment, and neither of them has found any specifically Yo giiciira fe atures in its description of causality. Ui thinks that the whole pratityasamutpiida exposition in the Savitarkiidibhumi is essentially similar to, and based on, the Vaibhiil?ika three-lifetimes/twofold causation system (1958: 283, 286). Suguro, too, although he points out the relationship between paratantriirtha and the trisvabhiiva theory, stresses that he can find no signs of either a Miidhyamika theory of causality or one based on iilayavijiiiina in the exposition of pratitya­samutpiida in the Savitarkiidibhumi (1982: 210-2 12). However, these lists of pratity asamutpiidiirthas do not resemble anything found in the Sarviistiviidin abhidharmatexts and commentaries. 534See Chapter 2, section 87."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"210 Instead, like a number of other lists pertaining to causality (for example, ' those of the ten hetus and the four yuktis), they appear to be unique to the abhidharma of the Yo gacara, and they first appear in one portion or another of the Yo giiciirabhumi, The prafityasamutpiidiirthas do not on the surface presuppose iilayavijiiiina or even a system of seed causation, although later texts sometimes interpret them in such terms. For example, the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya, in its comment on the giimbhZrya section of the Abhidharmasamuccaya pratityasamutpiida exposition, after explaining the five profundities in terms of the eleven arthas, explicitly connects the profundity of conditioned origination to causation by seeds.535 Even more strikingly, the Mahiiyiinasa'!'lgraha536 refers to a number of the aspects of causality described as pratityasamutpiidiirthas in its definiti on of the six modes of bijas. Bijas are: (1) momentary (k�a1Jika); (2) simultaneous (sahabhuka); (3) continuous (sa'!'ltiiniinuvrt); (4) determined (niyata); (5) dependent on conditions (pratyayiipe�a); (6) realized only in their own result (svaphalasyaiva siidhana).537 Of these, the first corresponds to �a1Jikiirtha, the third to hetup halaprabandhiinupacchediirtha, the fourth538 to anurup a­hetuphaliirtha, and the sixth to pratiniyatahetuphaliirtha. Thus, the Ma hiiyiinasa'!'lgraha, unlike the Yo giiciirabhumi and the Abhidharma­samuccaya, understands these facets of conditioned origination explicitly in terms of the operation of bijas. Furthermore, if Nishi is correct in his assertion that the source of most mAbhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya: 34.1 2-22; see Chapter 2, section 88. 536MahiiyiinasaJ?!graha I: 22 (MahiiyiinasaJ?!graha [tib.]: 12.5-11; Lamotte 1973: 40-41; Nagao 1982, v. 1: 156-161). For the Sanskrit equivalents, I have followed Aramaki's retranslation in Nagao 1982, v. 1. 537A similar exposition is fo und in the Ch 'eng wei shih lun (T. 1585: 9b7-cl; La Vallee Poussin 1928-1929: 116-1 18; Shindojoyuishikiron: 73-74). 538The MahiiyiinasaJ?!grahabhii�ya explains this in almost the same way that the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya explains anuriipahetuphaliirtha: \"lis sont determines: i1s sont individuellement determines (pratiniyata). Tout ne nait pas de tout, mais telle substance nait de tel germe qui lui est propre\" (Lamotte 1973: 40).

Given the facts that the pratityasamutpiidiirthas do not appear in any Sarvastivadin text, that they are explicitly related to bija theory by later Yogacara texts, and that many of the aspects of causality that they explain also appear elsewhere . exclusively in Yogacara texts, it seems fair to say that a bija interpretation of pratltyasamutpiida underlies the pratityasamutpiidiirthas, even though the term bija does not appear in their exposition. In the Yogacara reinterpretation of the Sarvastivadin category of cittaviprayuktasa7!lskiiras, some of the same features of causality that are described in the Yogacara expositions of pratltyasamutpiida and the ten hetus appear again in the definitions of various cittavipra­yuktasaf!!Skiiras, especially those belonging to the group of nine or ten that are Yogadira additions to the Sarvastivadin list and that, according to the Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya, are designations of states of cause and result.539 However, before turning to the Yogacara lists and discussions of the cittaviprayuktasa7!lskiiras and their relation to pratltyasamutpiida, I must first attempt to establish at what stage of development. the Sarvastivadin list was adopted by Yogacara. I shall also investigate sa7!lghabheda and siimagrl, two items not found on the orthodox Sarvastivadin list but sometimes considered by Sarvastivadins to be cittaviprayuktasa7!lskiiras.

Cittaviprayuktasa7!lskiiras in the Sarvastivada Literature The best-known discussion of cittaviprayuktasa7!lskiiras in a Western language is Jaini's \"Origin arid Development of the Theory of viprayukta-sa7!lskiiras\" (1959b). Jaini shows that the term is found in 539hetup haliivasthiiyiil7/ se�ii iti (Abhidharmasamuccayabhii�ya: 11.6-7). See section C2."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"212 Theravada literature as well as in Sarvastivada and Yo gacara, and he' suggests a strong Vaise1?ika influence on what he calls the \"dravya-vada of the Vaibha1?ika\" (1959b: 537) as well as in the case of the last nine cittaviprayuktasarrzskaras of the Abhidharmasamuccaya list. Although laini's account of the controversy in the Abhidharmakosabha�ya concerning the reality of the cittaviprayuktasarrzskaras is excellent, his treatment of the development of the lists in early Sarvastivadin texts, being limited to Sanskrit sources, is necessarily incomplete. For references to earlier abhidharma texts extant only in Chinese, the Japanese secondary literature is invaluable. Mizuno's long article entitled \"Shinf usooho ni tsuite\" (1956, perhaps the most exhaustive treatment of the subject), the article on cittaviprayuktasarrzskaras in Mo chizuki Bukkyo Dai Jiten (Mochizuki 1974: 2089), and the chapter on abhidharma in Yamada's Daijo Bukkyo Seiritsuron Josetsu (1959: 61-136) are particularly useful. Cox also summarizes the earlier Sarvastivadin lists in her translation and study of the cittaviprayukta­sarrzskara section of the Ny ayanusara (1995: 70-73), and Van den Broeck discusses them in some detail in the introduction to his translation of the Abhidharmamrta (1977: 56-62). Since the publication of Jaini's paper, a Sanskrit fragment of the Pancavastuka, probably the earliest source for the five categories (pancavastu),540 as well as for a list of cittaviprayuktasarrzskaras, has become available (Imanishi: 1969). On the basis of the partial manuscript and the Chinese translations, Imanishi has arrived at a text with a list of fi fteen items: (1) prapti; (2) asarrzjnasamapatti; (3) nirodhasamapatti; (4) asarrzjfiika; 5)jlvitendriya; (6) nikayasabhaga; (7) asrayapratilabha; (8) vastupratilabha; (9) ayatanapratilabha; (10) jati; (11) jara; (12) sthiti; (13) anityata; (14) namakaya; (15) padakaya (1969: 8).541 Although Imanishi's text does not indicate it, both Chinese translations, as well as the text of the Prakara7}apada, which is probably 54\"The five categories are: citta, caitta, riipa, cittaviprayukta, and asa711skrta (see Hirakawa 1973-1978, v. 1: xii-xxiv). 541The later Chinese translation includes vy aiijanakiiya as well, and even the very early translation of An Shih-kao 'ti.'t!!:jii'j probably indicates three kiiyas rather than two.

The addition is significant because it proves that, at this period of abhidharma literature, the list of cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras was still open.546 Other texts that include similar phrases are the Dharmaskandha, *, and ;f;@ (T. 1557: 998c25). :t is the standard translation for niima, and * is one of the translations for vyaiijana. Although I could not find ;f;@ as a translation for pada, one of its meanings, probably as an abbreviation for the compound ;f;@1;], is \"a stanza of fo ur lines\" (Matthews 1975: 240). Although the Sanskrit pada in this context probably means \"a sentence (piida) or a line of a giithii\" (Jaini 1959c: 99), it seems likely that An Shih-kao is in fact translating it by ;f;@, which at least preserves the notion of an utterance longer than a word or syllable that expresses a complete meaning. Incidentally, the character 1;] by itself is, in fact, used to translate pada. 542See Yamada 1959: 93. 543if.J'fij(O�it5}7.lIj:t:1To �:t5}7.lIj:t:qT (T. 1557 [An Shih-kao]: 998c25-26); fl;;fjfi it�{'HB�o j(Q��n�o :t�'L'::fm�1Tit (T. 1556 [Fa-ch'eng itlllt]: 995c23-24); fl ;;fjPJTfij(Q��ito �,L.'::f�B�o *�:t{'::fm�1T (T. 1542 [Prakara�apiida]: 692c8-9). 544Mizuno has pointed out that, in the Mahiivyutpatti (p. 152, item number 1999), eva111bhiigfyii� is added, along with bheda, prabandha, prabandhoparama, vyaiijana, a�ara, and var�a, to the twenty-four Yogiiciira cittaviprayuktasa111skiiras to fonn a list of thirty-one (1956: 32). He does not mention that it occurs after padakiiya and before pravrtti. It seems likely to me that it does not indicate a separate dharma in the Mahiivyutpatti list but rather refers to the unnamed additional cittaviprayukta­sa111skiiras mentioned by the pre-Abhidharmahrdaya texts and by the commentaries on the Abhidharmakosa. 545niima-kiiviidavas ceti. ca-sabda eva111jiitiyakiinukta-viprayukta-pradada­niirtha�. sa111gh a-bheda-prabhrtayo hi dravyatas citta-viprayuktii i�yante iti � evamjiitiyakii iti siistre 'py uktatviit (Abhidharmakosavyiikhyii: 142.28-3 1). 5461n fact, the list of caitasikas in the Paiicavastuka is similarly fo llowed by the phrase ye vii punar anye 'py eva111bhiigiyii dharmiis cittena sa111prayuktii ucyante caitasikii dharmii�.

The Abhidharmiivatiira, the only other extant source that predates the Abhidharmakosa, is found in Tibetan, Eastern Tocharian, and Chinese translations. Hsiian-tsang, the Chinese translator, adds the word \"et cetera\" (teng �) to the list of fourteen cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras,557 but the Tibetan translation does not.558 Van Velthem has remarked on the fact that Hsiian-tsang's translation on occasion contains more than the corresponding Tibetan (1977: xix-xx). Perhaps in this case Hsiian-tsang, when he translated the Abhidharmiivatiira in 658, had in mind the Abhidharmakosa, which he is said to have translated between 651 and 654 and which contains the word iidaya�.

The Abhidharmiivatiira is noteworthy for substituting ap riipti for prthagjanatva, which is simply a special case of ap riipti. According to Mochizuki, the identical list of cittaviprayukta­sa1!lskiiras in the Abhidharmakosa must have been based on the Abhidharmiivatiira (1974: 2089). The list in the Abhidharmakosa is generally considered to represent the orthodox Sarvastivadin list. Before coming back to later Sarvastivadin opinions about the constituents of the list, I shall compare the Yogacara list with the Sarvastivadin lists mentioned above. 2. The Relationship between the Sarvastivadin and the Yogacara Lists There are two passages about the cittaviprayuktasa1!lskiiras in the Paficavijfiiinakiiyamanobhumi of the Viniscayasa1!lgrahalJ,z. Of these, the first (Viniscayasa1!lgraha7;lz [tib.]: zi 21b1-29b1; T. 1579: 585c9-588c9) appears to be the oldest Yogacara exposition, and it is to this passage · that I devote the most attention in my later discussion. However, since it does not contain a complete list, I refer to the second passage, which includes the twenty-four cittaviprayuktasa1!lskiiras most frequently associated with Yo gacara, for the purpose of enumerating the Yogacara cittaviprayuktasa1!lskiiras.559 One should notice first of all that the first fourteen dharmas in this list correspond most closely to the list of the Abhidharmahrdaya; notably, both texts include prthagjanatva rather than ap riipti. The first passage, although it omits asa1!liiiisamiipatti, nirodhasamiipatti, and iisa1!lifiika, likewise contains prthagjanatva. In fact, all other Yogacara enumerations of the first fourteen cittaviprayuktasa1!lskiiras contain the 5591. 1� (priipti) 2. iWi:m:iE (asarrzjfiisamiipatti) 3. i�iil:iE (nirodhasamiipatti) 4. iWi:m ;R (iisarrzjfiika) 5. 1if;1� (jivitendriya) 6. * fil15t (nikiiyasabhiigatii) 7. l£(jiiti) 8. � (jarii) 9. f± (sthiti) 10. iWi1t (anityatii) II. t,Jit(niimakiiya) 12. 1iJJit (padakiiya) 13. )c Jit (vyafijanakiiya) 14. �l£tE (Prthagjanatva) IS. iilE$$ (pravrtti) 16. :iE� (pratiniyama) 17. ;f'!lt¥.

Another fe ature of all the lists fo und in the Yo giiciirabhiimi, as well as that of the Ta ch ' eng pai fa ming men [un, is that they do not contain any reference to \"other\" cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras. In the case of the Abhidharmasamuccaya, the Chinese translation includes the word \"et cetera\" (�) at the end of its list.560 However, neither the Sanskrit text nor the Tibetan translation does, thus suggesting that this word is another of Hsiian-tsang's additions. The appearance of a reference to other dhannas in the Chinese translation (also by Hsiian-tsang) of the Hs ien yang sheng chiao [un (T. 1602 : 484a27-28), the Sanskrit and Tibetan of which are no longer extant, is therefore suspect as well. The Paficaskandhaka, on the other hand, which includes only the first fo urteen dharmas, undeniably contains a reference to similar dharmas.561 P'u-kuang, in his commentary on the Ta ch 'eng pai fa ming men [un **si*�r���, explains that the reference to other dharmas in the Paficaskandhaka is to the last ten dharmas of the Yogacara list, beginning withpravrtti.562 On the basis of the above, I think that the Yo giiciirabhiimi tradition regarding the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras must have diverged fr om the Sarvastivadin tradition between the time of the Abhidharmahrdaya and that of the Abhidharmiivatiira. Of course, the Abhidharmahrdaya is considerably earlier than the ViniscaYasarrzgrahalJi. However, it is possible that, at the time of the composition of the Abhidharmahrdaya, the fo rerunners of the Yogacaras were already reconsidering the constituents, as well as the ontological status, of the category of cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras.

Perhaps it was in reaction to this that the Abhidharmahrdaya and its successors omitted such phrases and limited the category to fo urteen dharmas. 3. SaTflghabheda, Siimagrl, and the Reopening of the Sarvastivadin List If, as I propose, the Sarvastivadin school from about the time of the Abhidharmahrdaya closed the list of eittaviprayuktasaTflskiiras at fo urteen, the question arises as to whether, as a number of commentators suggest, Va subandhu re-opens the list with the phrase iidayas eeli in the verse of the Abhidharmakosa, and if so, why. In verse thirty-five and the first piida of verse thirty-six of Chapter II, Vasubandhu says \"the viprayuktasaTflskiiras are priipti, ap riipti, sabhiigatii, iisaTfljiiika, the (two) samiipattis,jivita, the /ak!fWzas, niimakiiya, et cetera.\"563 It is clear that, due to the exigencies of versification, Vasubandhu like earlier authors has abbreviated the names of some of these dharmas: sabhiigatii for nikiiyasabhiigatii;564 the (two) samiipattis for asaTfljiiisamiipatti565 and nirodhasamiipatti;566 jivita for jivitendriya;S67 and the lak:fa7}as for jiiti, jarii, sthiti, and anityatii.S68 Therefore, it seems likely that \"et cetera\" here simply refers to padakiiya and vyaiijanakiiya.

The inclusion of samagrf is interesting for a number of reasons. Cox notes that Satpghabhadra does not discuss the meaning of this term as a cittaviprayuktasarrzskara. However, she refers to the Vibha�a, where it is said that samagrf, and not the object itself, is the cause of the awareness of a composite object. 580 The objection is then raised: \"if the individual (conditions of awareness taken) separately are not called the cause, then the totality (samagrf) of many factors must not be the cause.\" To this, the answer is given: \"The individual (conditions of awareness taken) separately are not called the totality; the assembled group of many fa ctors is called the totality. Therefore, the individual (conditions of awareness taken) separately are not called the cause; the totality (consisting of) many fa ctors c-an be called the cause.,,581 Cox also mentions a passage from the Ny ayanusara, according to which samagrf is the \"cause of the cognition of composites\" (Cox 1995: 77 n. 26; T. 1562: 350c29-351a). As we shall see, the Vibha�a description of samagrf in this context is quite similar to .the Yogacara definition of samagrf as a cittaviprayuktasarrzskara, and it is not surprising that Cox looks to these other passages for some clue as to what Satpghabhadra meant by saying that samagrf is a cittaviprayuktasarrzskara. additions to the Sanskrit text of the Abhidharmakosa, she does not bracket the word ''type'' in her translation of Abhidharmakosa 11 36a: \"name set (niimakiiya) and so on, and [other dharmas of that] type.\" While she is correct that Hsiian-tsang uses � to render ca, the entire phrase, \"other dharmas of that type,\" is really Hsiian-tsang's interpretation, not what Vasubandhu wrote.

In the Chii she lun chi, P'u-kuang relates an argument between Va subandhu and Satpghabhadra regarding siimagrl as a cittaviprayukta­saTfiskiira. When Vasubandhu challenges Satpghabhadra about the nature of siimagrl, Satpghabhadra says that it is what one abandons at . the time of saTfighabheda . Vasubandhu denies that this is a -separate dharma and maintains that siimagrl should be included in sabhiigatii.582 After presenting a rather long debate, P'u-kuang states that, because there are different expositions of siimagrl, the matter needs further investigation.583 However, he is certain that siimagrl does not consist of priipti, and he uses the same argument as in his discussion of saTfigha­bheda (see the next paragraph). I have not been able to find any trace of this debate in either the Abh idharmakosa or the Ny iiyanusiira; nevertheless it calls into question whether the broader meanings that Cox suggests fo r siimagrl as a cittaviprayuktasaTfiskiira (1995: 77 n. 26) are, in fact, intended by Satpghabhadra. P'u-kuang, in his discussion of Abhidharmakosa IV 98, also has something to say about saTfighabheda and asiimagrl. After mentioning . the opinions of two other teachers,584 he giyes his own definition of asiimagrl: it is ap riipti with respect to siimagrl (which, in this case, clearly refers to monastic concord). Prior to saTfighabheda, there is siimagrl, and all members of the monastic community, sharing this siimagrl, can obtain the iiryamiirga. In other words, because the saTfigha has siimagrl, it is possible for the monks to enter the Path. If, however, the saTfigha is broken, siimagrl is relinquished, and asiimagrf arises: because the siimagrf has been broken, it is impossible to enter the Path. This is the reason that saTfighabheda is a deadly sin (anantaryakarma).

However, siimagrz does not consist of priipti, because not every dh arma has an opposite. For example, although the state of being an ordinary person is equivalent to apriipti of the state of being an iirya, the state of being an iirya does not only consist of priipti. 585 P'u-kuang thus seems to understand siimagrz as the opposite of sarrzghabheda and not as a gener�l causal principle, and he denies the separate reality of both of them as real cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras not included in Va subandhu's list of fo urteen. Furthermore, he interprets the lei as indicating subclasses of the fo urteen, and maintains that Vasubandhu did not intend to include any other dharmas.586 Fa-pao, on the other hand, disagrees with P'u-kuang; he says that Sarpghabhadra's inclusion of siimagrz is justified since Vasubandhu, fo llowing texts such as the Dharmaskandha and Prakara1}apiida, intended to leave the list open. 587 Thus, there is some basis in the Vibhii�ii for Ya somitra's assertion that sarrzghabheda should be included on the list, and it is not too far­fe tched for Sarpghabhadra to substitute siimagrz, in the sense of the opposite of sarrzghabheda . However, there is no evidence that in the Abhidharmakosavyiikhyii or the Ny iiyiinusiira either of these terms appears in the context of the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras with a meaning extending beyond monastic discord or concord. In the end, we cannot say anything conclusive about sarrzghabheda and siimagrz as cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras in these abhidharma texts. We do not know whether Vasubandhu actually intended to allow fo r the possibility of more than fo urteen cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras, although I suspect that he did not.

In this section I examine the Yogiiciira reinterpretation of several of the cittaviprayuktasarrzskaras that are common to both lists in order to establish why Yogaciira, if it considers the cittaviprayukta­sarrzskaras to be merely prajiiapti, preserves the category. I also discuss the group of cittaviprayuktasarrzskaras that are specifically associated with Yogiiciira in the hope of explaining why they were added.

According to the first explanation, the word \"et cetera\" (�), which fo lIows siimagrl in Hsiian­tsang's translation (but is fo und in neither the Sanskrit text nor the Tibetan translation), should be understood to include asiimagrl.

The SautrantikaIYogaciira602 criticism of many of the Sarvastivadin cittaviprayuktasaTflskiiras is based on a refutation of the overly mechanistic Sarvastivadin· explanation of these aspects. By \"mechanistic,\" I mean that Sarvastivada fm ds it necessary to posit entities or forces to explain causal phenomena. The Sautrantikas and Yogaciiras, on .the other hand, believe that these phenomena come about due to the very nature of conditioned existence. cittaviprayukta­saTflskiiras such as priipti are maintained as descriptions of phenomena but are no longer considered their causes, while pravrtti, etc., are added to turn the Yogacara interpretation of the cittaviprayuktasaTflskiiras into an extensive discussion of causality.

Furthermore, he stated that the Yogiiciira school relied on the Diir�tiintika's opinion that the cittaviprayuktasaTflSkiiras are merely prajiiapti (1930: 145). However, he did not discuss the explanations of some cittaviprayuktasaTriskiiras in terms of bija, which are found in the YogiiciirabhUmi and Abhidharmakosabhii�a and which are the subject of much of the following."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"232 earliest603 Yogacara exposition of the cittaviprayuktasaf!lskiiras.60� Moreover, it is certainly the most explicit source of information about the dharmas peculiar to Yogacara as well as about the specifically Yo gacara interpretation of cittaviprayuktasaf!lskiiras that belong equally to the Sarvastivadin list. Before I examine the group of the last ten cittaviprayuktasaf!lskiiras, I discuss some of these reinterpretations in which the term bija appears. These definitions are of particular interest to me because they contain many of the arguments adduced by Va su­bandhu in his so-called \"Sautrantika\" criticism of the Sarvastivadin cittaviprayuktasaf!lskiiras. Significantly, although some of these arguments can also be traced to the SautriintikaJDiir�tantika tradition, a number of them seem to have originated in the Yo giiciirabhumi. a. Jii ti605 The first Viniscayasaf!lgraha1Jl passage begins by denying the real existence of the saf!lskrtalak�ar.zas and granting them only provisional status. The text makes a number of arguments against the ultimate existence of jiiti, several of which I mention briefly. The first of these is based on a denial of the real existence of the three times that 6n3This is in accord with Mizuno's opinion that the Yogiiciirabhumi originally did not posit a definite number of cittaviprayuktasaJ?1Skiiras; the example he gives is our first Vi niscayasaf!lgrahar;1 passage, which omits asaf!lpiikasamiipatti, nirodha­samiipatti, and iisaf!ljfiika, as well as deSa and asiimagri (he mistakenly says that it also omits siimagrl). Later, he says, the number was fi xed, and he gives the Manobhumi and second Vi niScayasaf!lgrahar;1 passages as examples (1956: 58). 6{14However, the separate existence of the fo ur saf!lskrtalalqar;as is denied as early as the Bodhisattvabhumi, which maintains that they are nothing other than the saf!lskrtadharmas themselves (tatra bodhisattva� saf!lskiira-miitraf!l sthiipayitvii na tasya jiitif!l na sthitif!l na jariif!l niinityatiif!l sarva-kiilaf!l dravya-svabhiiva­parini�pattita� pasyati. tat kasya heto�. saf!lskiira-miitram utpadyamiinam up alabhate niisyiinyiif!l jiitif!l na sthitif!l na jariif!l niinitycitiif!l-Bodhisattvabhumi: 279.6-1 1; T. 1579: 544bI7-20). 6n5 A study on momentariness in Buddhism contains a chapter on the saf!lskrtalalqar;as in which are cited many of the passages discussed below (Rospatt 1995: 40-66)."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"233 immediately precedes the discussion of the lak�m:tas.606 Once the separate existence of the .future sarrzskiiras themselves has been rejected, the real existence of jiiti, which pertains to the fu ture, must also be rejected.607 This argument foreshadows one of Vasubandhu's criticisms of the Sarvastivadin position in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya,608 and a similar objection is also raised in the Ch 'eng wei shih lun.609 Another . argument is that all dharmas are caused by their own bijas; hence there is no need fo r an entity calledjiiti to produce them.6lO Finally, the text asks whether jiiti is the actUalization of the sarrzskrtadharmas or the cause of their actualization.

Furthermore, its explanation that they are designations for the saf!lskrtadharmas is perfectly clear and is obviously reflected in Vasubandhu's statement of his own position, particularly in the second of three verses that he composes to support his argument : \"Jiiti is existence that has not existed before; sthiti is the series; destruction (=anityatii) is the cutting off [of the series]; the change in state of sthiti (=jarii) is intended to be the difference between the earlier and later [moments of] the series.\"616 Kato suggests that Harivarman, the \"Sthavira\" of the Ny iiyiinusiira, and Vasubandhu all rely on the Dar�tantika of the Vibhii$ii in their criticisms of the saf!lskrtalak$ar.zas (1989: 308).

According to the Ny iiyiinusiira, it is the Sthavira's opinion that Va subandhu quotes in the first of the three verses in the Abhidharmakosabhii$ya mentioned in the preceding paragraph: The stream of saf!lskrtadharmas is called jiiti when it arises, 615de Ita bas na skye ba la sogs pa yan 'du byed rnams la [bta]gs pa 'i yod pa yin par rig par bya '0/ de la rgyu yod na ran gi mtshan fiid snon ma byun ba 'grub pa ni 'du byed rnams kyi skye ba ies bya '0 / sna ma las phyi ma gian iiid du gian du 'gyur ba iiid ni 'du byed rnams kyi rga ba ies bya '0/ skye ba'i dus tsam la gnas pa ni 'du byed mams kyi gnas pa ies bya ste / de Ita bas na skye ba 'i skad cig gi 'og tu 'jig pa 'i skad cig ni 'du byed mams kyi 'jig pa ies bya'o (Viniscayasarrzgraha1J.1 [tib.]: zi 22a2-4). t&����NiHr$1F.tMii�o *\"m*\"IZ9t&��n'�p*§�!lizt;��!I.�1.i,1;:o f&���n'�lltr�gljm �1.i,�o I!P�Jt�n'1;:jil:t1wm�1.i,1!o 1;:�IJjJ�1&�1T�!lmm�1.i,i�o m-��-m-(T. 1579: 585c24-28).

Furthermore, both the Hs ien yang sheng chiao lun625 and the Abhidharma­samuccaya,626 while omitting their reasons for denying the reality of the [a�al}as, come to the same conclusions, as does the Ch 'eng wei shih [un, which includes its reasons in full. 627 However, unlike these three that \"unlike the Sautriintikas, at least some sections among the Diir�tiintikas took the canonical position that origination, change and destruction alone are sal!lskrtala�al}as as their starting point\" (1995: 63 n. 136). 624Vasubandhu makes this criticism explicitly in his comment on Abhidharmakosa II 46c-d. The objection is anticipated that futurejati would produce all future dharmas at the same time (api ca yady anagata jatir janyasya janika kim arthal!l sarvam anagatal!l yugapan notpadyate-Abhidharmakosabha�ya: 79.1 7).

The verse gives the Sarviistiviidin response, namely that production does not occur without causes and conditions, that is to say, according to the Bha�ya, without the totality of causes and conditions (janyasya janika jatir na hetupratyayair vina na hi yina hetupratyayasamagrya jatir janika bhayati-Abhidharmakosabha�ya: 79.18-19).

It is difficult to trace the relationships among the various texts in this case. I have argued that in several places Va subandhu rejects the Diir�tiintika-Harivarman-Sri1ata position in favor of that of the Yo giiciira­bhiimi, but here the Dar�tantika and Yogacara texts are essentially in agreement. Jaini has identified Vasubandhu's three main arguments against the real existence of the lak�alJas: \"( 1) they cannot simultaneously work upon a momentary (k�alJika) dharma; (2) the theory of up alalqalJa628 results in the fal lacy of regress; (3). the term sarrzskrta in the slUra quoted by the Vaibha�ikas does not refer to a momentary dharma but to a series of them (praviiha)\" (Jaini 1959b: 543). Of these, the first is most qbviously similar to the Dar�tiintika argument mentioned in the Vibhii�ii. The second, although it originated early,629 is not attributed by the Vibhii�ii to the Dar�tantika or by the Ny iiyiinusiira to Sri1ata. On the other hand, it seems at least related to the last argument in the Vi niscayasarrzgrahalJi. As fo r the third, Vasubandhu's argument is closest to the Sthavira's as represented in the Ny iiyiinusiira. However, all of these texts, at least implicitly, take the lalqalJas to operate in the stream or the personality, rather than on an individual dharma. Clearly, Vasubandhu essentially agrees with the Dar�tantika position. However, his arguments cannot be traced solely to the Dar�tantika tradition, and it is possible that he was influenced by the Yo giiciirabhiimi as well. 630 In any case, the Dar�tantika and the 628Jaini is clearly thinking of the anula�a1Jas here. 62·See, for example, the Vi bhii�ii (T. 1545: 200c I3ff.; cited in Cox 1995: 357 n. 17) and the Madhyamakasiistra (Chapter Seven, verses 1 ff. ; cited in La Val1ce Poussin 1971, v. 1: 224 n. 3). 6311With regard to the relationship between the Yogiiciirabhiimi and Harivarman, a comparison of their respective lists of cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras shows that, while the Yogiiciirabhumi includes prthagjanatva instead of apriipti (see note 590), the Ta ttvasiddhisiistra includes both prthagjanatva and ap riipti (T. 1646: 289a21\"22; Katsura 1974: 86).

Priipti As it does in the case of the sarrzskrtalak�at:tas, the Viniscaya­sarrzgraha1}l explains in detail the reasons for denying the real existence . of priipti. If priipti is real, it must be the cause of the arising of all sarrzsJertadharmas as well as the cause of the non-loss of all dharmas.631 The text first denies that priipti can be the cause of the arising of the sarrzsJertadharmas. The point of this argument seems to be that priipti itself, being a sarrzsJertadharma, would have to be the cause of its own arising, which is impossible since it must have been nonexistent prior to its arising.632 It cannot be the cause of the non-loss of all dharmas because if it were, the priiptis of all good, bad, and neutral dharmas would be present simultaneously, and morally contradictory dharmas would arise simultaneously. Therefore, the two functions of priipti are both illogical.633 The first of these arguments presages the second of Va subandhu's three criticisms of priipti as the cause of production of its criticism of the reality of the cittaviprayuktasaT{lskiiras, it is hard to explain· why it seems to follow the Abhidharmahrdaya in including only prthagjanatva; furthermore, it also omits anyathiitva (�). 631gal te 'thob pa rdzas su yod par gyur na / de 'du byed mams kyi 'bywi ba 'i rgyu 'am / yan na chos dan mi 'bral bar 'gyur ba 'i rgyur 'gyur gran na (ViniscayasaT{lgraha1J1 [tib.]: zi 24b8-25al).

Mizuno mentions this definition as . an example of the way in which the Y ogiiciira school adds its own theories of bija or iilayavijniina to material that it has \"inherited\" from Sarviistiviida or the Sautriintikas (1956: 57-58).

Both passages contain long explanations of why the Dar�tantikas (according to the Kokuyaku Issaikyo [Bidon-bu II: 24 1 n. 7], the older translation of the Vibhii�ii attributes this position to Buddhadeva) reject priipti as a real dharma, but neither pasage contains any mention of blja. 648Yamabe states that this discussion of blja is fo und within the cittaviprayukta­saf!!skiira section (Yamabe 1990: 14), thus suggesting that, in the Vi niscaya­saf!!grahaT}l, blja is in fa ct a cittaviprayuktasaf!!skiira. A possible justification for this opinion can be fo und in the Viniscayasaf!!grahaT}z on the Cintiimayzbhiimi, where the distinction between the real and the provisional is analyzed at great length. According to this passage, all twenty-four cittaviprayuktasaf!!skiiras except fo r asaf!!jiiisamiipatti, nirodhasamiipatti, and iisaf!!jiiika , as well as bija, vijiiapti, and avijiiapti, are designations for the saf!!slq-tadharmas (ViniscayasQ/!lgrahaT}1 [tib.]: zi 208a4-6; T. 1579: 659aI2-16; see Schmithausen 1987: 158, 454 n. 1016). However, it is clear that this passage is about prajiiapti, not exclusively the cittaviprayuktasaf!!skiiras. Coming back to our original passage, we can say that blja, like the cittaviprayuktasaf!lSkiiras, is simply a designation for the saf!!skrtadharmas. Nevertheless, although the other dh armas mentioned are elsewhere (for example, in the second Vi niscayasaf!!grahaT}z passage) specifically caned cittaviprayuktasaf!!skiiras, blja is nowhere so defined in the Yogiiciirabhiimi."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"244 the first Viniscayasarrzgraha1'}1 cittaviprayuktasarrzskiira649 passage is one of the sources of Vasubandhu's definition of bija (1990).650 However, it is at odds with Nishi's understanding of the development of bija theory. Nishi remarks on the close relationship between Yogacara and Sarvastivada, and he identifies passages from the Vibhii$ii containing ideas about bija that are similar to those ofYogaciira but less completely worked out. According to Nishi, the \"Sautriintika\" position in the Abhi­dharmakosabhii$ya is the fo rerunner of the fully developed Yogacara doctrine, in which iilayavijiiiina is established as the basis for the bijas (1975: 483-495). laini writes under the same assumption (1959a). Nishi's research, nevertheless, does not really take the Yo giiciirabhumi into consideration and must therefore be considered somewhat dated. Similarly, Cox's statement that \"the earliest sources that describe in detail the dynamics of the seed theory are Vasubandhu's Abhidharma­kosabhii$ya and Karmasidci.hiprakara1'}a, and SaIighabhadra's Ny iiyiinusiira\" (1995: 103 n. 44) clearly must be revised in the light of current research on the Yo giiciirabhumi. , The Abhidharmasamuccaya and the Hs ien yang sheng chiao lun both rely on the Viniscayasarrzgraha1'}1 in denying the real existence of priipti.

Prthagjanatva Both the Abhidharmasamuccaya and the Paiicaskandhaka give the same very simple definition of prthagjanatva that can be fo und in abhidharma texts such as the Sarrzyuktiibhidharmahrdaya: prthag­janatva is the non-possession of the iiryadharmas.653 The Hs ien yang sheng chiao lun identifies two types of prthagjanas: the fo ol (biila), who has been a fo ol fo r countless lifetimes, and the untutored one (asrutaviin), who fo llows false paths that diverge fr om the Tathagata's teaching.654 Although these three texts consider prthagjanatva, like the rest of the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras, to be prajiiaptis, there is nothing else about their definitions that distinguishes them from those fo und in abhidharma texts before the Abhidharmiivatiira. As I have mentioned above, beginning with the Abhidharmiivatiira, prthagjanatva is replaced by ap riipti. The Dar�tantika of the Vibhii$ii is, again, the earliest source that denies the reality of prthagjanatva, but the Vibhii$ii does not say on what basis he does SO.655 Harivarman, on the other hand, gives his own reasoning in detail. There is no nature (dharma) of an ordinary person that is distinct fr om the ordinary person himself. If there were, we would have to accept pot-ness, as well as ideas such as number, measure, sameness, difference, conjunction, disjunction, desirability, 6s 'p rthagjanatvarrz ka tamat / iiryadharmiiniim apratilambhe prthagjanatvam iti prajiiaptilJ.

This contradicts the Buddhist principle that a dharma is identical with its own-nature. 6 57 Finally Harivarman criticizes those who base their abhidharma on heterodox scripture, namely those who maintain that prthagjanatva, etc., are real, as well as those who say that asarrzskrtas such as tath a tii, dharmatii, bhutakop, and pratityasamutpiida, etc., are real. In conclusion, he recommends that they should deeply ponder the principles and not merely fo llow the letter [of the text).658 In contrast to Harivarman's purely negative argument, the first ViniscayasarrzgrahmJi passage again explains the designation in terms of seeds. Prthagjanatva refers to those seeds of darsanaheya dharmas in the three worlds that have not yet been permanently destroyed.659 There are fo ur types of prthagjanatva, one included in the gotra of those not 656r\"mo FL;!crt:t�A.'/F;f§l@!1T 0 ���fiiJ 0 � 8 0 FL;!crt/FJ'tFL;!Co ;6=5JU;ff FL;!crto lj);8!�5JU ;fflUi:rt�o ::x.t�:i:-�15-�HfM�ito W8!5JU ;ff (T. 1646: 289c3-6).

At least this is what the Ch 'eng wei shih lun suggests in the passage mentioned above. Moreover, the long passage664 preceding Vasubandhu's definition of bija, which contains an explanation of the abandonment or non-abandonment of kleSas in terms of states of the iisraya, makes it clear that it is the presence of undestroyed seeds of kleSas that prevents one fr om obtaining the iiryadharmas. Therefore, the saT{ttati in which the iiryadharmas are not present is in fa ct the saT{ttati in which the seeds of klesas still exist, and Vasubandhu's understanding of prthagjanatva is actually identical to that of the first· ViniscayasaT{tgraha1J.z passage. As we have seen, the Dar�tantika and Harivarman both merely criticize the status of prthagjanatva as a dharma without defining it, while Srilata is silent. Thus, Vasubandhu again identifies as Sautrantika, with no textual corroboration for his claim, a position taken from the Yo giiciirabhumi. 4. Yogacara CittaviprayuktasaT{tskiiras I now come to the group of cittaviprayuktasaT{tskiiras that are specifically associated with Yogacara.

However, the order is not always the same For example, in the Cintiimay'ibhumi of the ViniscayasaT{tgraha1J.z, the list begins with siimagrz (ViniscayasaT{tgraha1J.'i [tib.]: zi 208a6; T. 1579: 659aI4- 16). Nor is the number always the same. For example, the Abhidharmasamuccaya includes only nine dharmas, omitting asiimagrz. Our first ViniscayasaT{tgraha1J.z passage is peculiar in that it includes siimagrz after prthagjanatva but before niima-, pada-, and vyaiijanakiiya. After this, it defmes the dharmas from pravrtti to saT{tkhyii in the order given ab ove, with the exception of desa, which it omits entirely.

Obviously, however, the Yogadira definition of siimagri, although it includes Sarp.ghabhadra's, is far more . extensive. I think that both the Vzniscayasarrzgraha1Jz and Sarp.ghabhadra derive their notion of siimagrz as a cittaviprayuktasarrzskiira fr om the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiira, sarrzghabheda, in the Vzbhii�ii; that is to say, they give the status of a dharma to the opposite of sarrzghabheda. However, unlike Sarp.ghabhadra, the Vzniscayasarrzgraha1Jz extends the scope of the term to encompass a broadly applicable, causal principal. b. (AsiimagrZ) Although asiimagrl is not mentioned in the first Vzniscayasarrzgra­ha1J1 passage, I discuss it here, since it, like siimagrl, is a possible point of connection between the Sarvastivadin and Yogacara lists of cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras. A definition of asiimdgrz is fo und only once in the Yo giiciirabhiimi: in the second Vzniscayasarrzgraha1Jz passage asiimagrz is simply said to be the opposite of siimagrz.679 In this passage siimagrz is defined as the non-absence of the constituents of action and consists of three types: assemblage siimagrz, singleness-of-purpose siimagrl, and perfe ction siimagrl.68o These types are not fu rther defined, but singleness-of­purpose siimagrz perhaps corresponds to the conventional siimagrz of·the first passage.

Unlike the majority of the cittaviprayuktasaTflskiira lists in the Yo giiciirabhumi and that of the Hs ien yang sheng chiao [un, the list of cittaviprayuktasaTflskiiras in the Abhidharmasamuccaya does not include asiimagrz. P'u-kuang offers two explanations for its omission. The first is based upon Hsiian-tsang's addition of the word \"et cetera\" after siimagrz in his translation of the Abhidharmasamuccaya: P'u­kuang says that \"et cetera\" refers to asiimagrz.683 Since neither the Sanskrit text nor the Tibetan translation includes \"et cetera,\" we can discount this first explanation. P'u-kuang's second explanation is more convincing: asiimagrz is omitted because one type is included in prthagjanatva, which is the non-�btaining of the iiryamiirga, and the other types can be inferred from this. 684 Thus, we can see that, like siimagrz, asiimagrz is defmed broadly in these Yogacara texts. While siimagrz refers to the concatenation of causal fa ctors that results in production, asiimagrz is a designation for the fa ct that if something fa ils to be produced, it is because the conditions necessary for production do not cooperate. In addition, special cases of siimagrz are mentioned in both the Vini.ScayasaTflgraha1Jz passages and defined in detail in the first. Special cases of asiimagrz, on the other hand, are implied in the second passage and are referred to by P'u-kuang. Therefore, the opposite of conventional siimagrz, or perhaps of singleness-of-purpose siimagrz, probably corresponds to saTflgha­bheda in the Vibhii�ii.

This inconsistency suggests that they are somehow separate fr om, or more important than, the other eight Yogacara cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras. In fact, siimagrl is the most basic aspect of causality denoted by this group of dharmas. The fu ndamental role of siimagrl in the causal process is emphasized, although outside of the context of the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras, in the Paramiirthagiithiis.

Five of the verses (27-31) explain in terms of seed theory how the operations of cause and result come to be mistaken for a self. According to the commentary, the first of these is a refutation of possible objections to the statement that \"there is, from the point of view of ultimate reality, no proprietor nor doer nor fe eler but only cause(s) and result(s).,,686 The verse itself reads as fo llows: \"because of the non-de struction of the course of causes, activity proceeds due to siimagrl; [sarrzskrtadharmas] arise from their own cause, and they make a totality.,,687 685Manobhiimi (Yogiiciirabhiimi: 69.3-4); second Vi niscayasaTflgraha7}z passage (ViniscayasaTflgraha7}1 [tib.]: zi 78al-3; T. 1579: 608a2-6); Abhidharmasamuccaya (18.22; siimagrz only); Hsien yang sheng chiao [un (T. 1602: 484a27); Ta ch 'engpaiJa mingmen [un (T. 1614: 855cI5-16). 686Schmithausen 1987: 235.

All references to the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiira, pratiniyama, and to pratiniyatahetuphaliirtha are later than our first reference to pratiniyamahetu in the Bodhisattvabhumi, which is one of the oldest portions of the Yo giiciirabhumi. The relative positions of the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras and pratiniyatahetuphaliirtha, however, are not so clear, since the chronological relationship between the portions of the Yo giiciirabhumi in which they occur has not been definitely established. However, whether or not the Viniscayasarrzgraha1Jl is, as I believe, generally older than the Savitarkiidibhumi, the Yogacara exposition of prantyasamutpiida exists in at least one fo rm (in the Sriivakabhumi) that is undoubtedly older than any Yogacara discussion of the cittavipra­yuktasarrzskiiras. Therefore, although the earliest reference to pratiniyatahetuphaliirtha that we have is fo und in the Savitarkiidi­bhUmi,711 it is not impossible that the category of the pratltyasamutpiidii­rthas was borrowed fr om another, no longer extant exposition of pratltyasamutpiida, later than the Sriivakabhumi, which does not mention them, but earlier than the Savitarkiidibhumi.

Kala The definitions of kala in the Abhidharmasamuccaya and Hs ien yang sheng chiao lun are phrased differently but are similar in meaning. According to the Abhidharmasamuccaya, kala is a designation for the fo rward movement of the stream of causes and results.740 The Bh[z�ya explains that the time in which cause and result have both arisen and been destroyed is called the past. Similarly, the time in which they have not yet arisen is called the fu ture, and the time in which they have arisen but not yet been destroyed is called the present. 74 1 The Hs ien yang sheng chiao lun says that kala refers to the fa ct that saf!lslq-tadharmas progress by arising and being destroyed again and again.742 The second Viniscayasaf!lgrahalJi definition is even more abstract,but it also amounts to the same thing: kala is the non­interruption of the stream of saf!lslq-tas.743 The basic definition in the first Vi niscayasaf(lgrahalJi passage is more complicated.

To prove that things cannot arise without a cause, he adduces the examples of the seed and the sprout, and fire and that which is cooked, and he says that the efficacy of the seed and fire can be verified by the determination of place and time.754 The Abhidharmakosavyakhya explains that, in the case of the seed, the sprout will arise only in the place in which the seed is planted, and it will appear immediately fo llowing [the destruction ot] the seed. Similarly it suggests that, in the case of fire, that which is cooked will appear only in the place where the fire is located and only at the appropriate time.

Kat6 has identified seven references to Dar�tantika opinions, one regarding prthagjanatva, two regarding samanviigama (=priipti) and/or asamanviigama, three regarding the sarrzskrtalalqalJas, and one regarding niima-, pada-, and vyaizjanakiiya (1989: 303-304). Our next earliest source is Harivarman's Ta ttvasiddhisiistra, which contains a fa irly long section in which each cittaviprayuktasarrzskiira is shown to lack independent existence. Harivarman is of particular interest to us because of the way in which he invokes the principle of causality to show the superfluousness of the cittaviprajuktasarrzskiiras, particularly jiiti. 768 Finally, Sri1ata's denial of the reality of the sarrzskrta­lalqalJas is similar to Harivarman's (Kat6 1989: 306-307) .. One of the earliest sections of the Yo giiciirabhumi, the Bodhisattva­bhumi, although it does not discuss the category of cittaviprayukta­sarrzskiiras or even mention the term, denies the separate existence of the sarrzskrtalak�alJas on the grounds that they refer to nothing other than the sarrzskrtadharmas. This argument is no different from those of the Dar�tantika and Harivarman. However, in the first passage of the Vi niscayasarrzgrahalJl, we fi nd a radical interpretation of the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras. Only part of this interpretation, the insistence that the cittaviprayuktasarrzskiiras are merely prajizapti, can be traced to those earlier sources. The explanation of many of the cittaviprayukta-76RHarivarman identifies as the· deep meaning of the Buddhadharma the statement that, since all dharmas arise due to the coming together of a variety of conditions, no [single] dharma can produce another dharma Cx.1§!liti*�o �\\!l??<�;fO.g.:ff ��¥t�o jiftifc 4!lIiitfiE:��it-T. 1646: 289b21-22).

Sastri translates this as follows: \"The Buddha himself explains the import of the term Jati in the Dvadasa­Nidana-Sutra thus: The birth (jati) of such and such living beings in the midst of such and such places is the gaining of the five aggregates of elements. So jati is the first appearance of five aggregates of elements\" (Sastri 1978, v. 2: 189). However, he does not further identify the Dvadasa-Nidana-Sutra; the Repertoire du Canon Bouddhique Sino-Japonais (Demieville 1978: 70) identifies one sutra by the short title of +=IZ5l� (T. 713), but it does not contain such a definition of jati. The last sentence of this passage contradicts the three lifetimes/twofold causation theory, which locates jati in the future."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"279 sarrzskiiras in terms ofbija is the original contribution of this passage and marks a divergence. from, or advance upon, the philosophy of the earlier \"ritics of Sarviistivada, who did not use the term bija, at least not in any systematic way.769 Furthermore, the addition of the final group of cittaviprayuktasa1'(lskiiras is an example of the tendency in portions of the Yo giiciirabhiimi to construct a new abhidharma, that is to say, an abhidharma different from those of the Hinayana schools. Moreover, the references to other expositions of causality within the Yo giiciirabhiimi, which are also examples of this new abhidharma, show a willingness to consider it as authoritative. Vasubandhu in his discussion of cittaviprayuktasa1'(lskiiras in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya thus relies on two group s oftexts. For his criticism of the reality of the cittaviprayuktasa1'(l�kiiras, he goes back directly to the earliest sources as well as to the Yo giiciirabhiimi. But in his explanation that certain dharmas are really bijas he reveals his knowledge of the Yo giiciirabhiimi770 and his acceptance of ideas fo und in it but not in the works of the earlier Sautrantikas. Therefore, if we call Vasubandhu a Sautrantika, he is a different kind of Sautrantika than, for example, Harivarman or Srilata. Honj6, as I have mentioned above, contrasts the orthodox Hinayana Sautrantikas, the earliest of whom predate the Vibhii�ii, and who include the Dar�tantika, Harivarman, and Srilata, with the Mahayana Sautrantika, namely Vasubandhu (1992: 152). In characterizing Vasubandhu thus, Honj6 takes into account Vasubandhu's affinity with the earlier Sautrantikas, as well as his use of their name, while alluding to his reliance on the Yo giiciirabhUmi. However, might we not just as 769Honjo, who identifies Asvagho�a's school as Sautrantika (Honjo 1993), has, in a personal communication, drawn my attention to the fact that Asvagho�a uses the term bfja. However, an examination of the occurrence of the term in, for example, the Buddhacarita shows that it is used in a simile and not with the technical significance it acquires in the Viniscayasa\"f!lgrahar,zi: rtubhiimyambuvirahiid yathii bfja\"f!l na rohati I rohati pratyayais tais tais tadvat so 'pi mato mama (Buddhacarita XII 72; Johnston 1972: 137, 179). 77\"For other contexts in which Vasubandhu in the Abhidharmakosabhii�ya shows his familiarity with, and presumably approval of, doctrines originating in the Yogiiciirabhiimi, see Hakamaya 1986."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"280 well characterize the Dar�tfuJ.tika, et aI ., as Hinayana Yogacaras? Better still, we should perhaps call them pre-Yogiiciirabhiimi Yogacaras, thus acknowledging the fa ct, repeatedly pointed out by Schmithausen (1987), that much of the material in the Yo giiciirabhiimi and other early Yogacara texts, although not identifiable as Sarvastivada, cannot be designated as Mahayana. Hakamaya, in his discussion of the term piirviiciirya in the Abhidharmako.§abhii�ya, sees the Yogacara school as we generally define it as a group that emerged fr om among the yogiiciiras, in the sense of practitioners of yoga, who had a much longer history than the school that later took the name. According to Hakamaya, this group, which was more theoretically inclined than the general run of practitioners, came to be known as the piirviiciiryas, and it is by the name piirviiciirya that Vasubandhu refers to Asailga, the most illustrious representative of the group (1986: 100). Hakamaya does not identify any texts associated with the pre-Yogacara yogiiciiras, nor does he state clearly whether the piirviiciiryas existed before the time of AsaIiga. Nevertheless, by enlarging the scope of the term yogiiciira, he suggests another way of looking both at non-Mahayana material in Yogacara texts and at figures who are identified as Dar�tantika or Sautrantika and whose ideas are similar to those of the Yogacara. In this context, it is interesting to note that there are several texts, generally considered Hinayana, that bear the title Yo giiciirabhiimi. The best-known of these is the work of SaIigharak�a, which has been translated and studied by Demieville (1954). This text, although it is perhaps later than Hakamaya's original yogiiciiras, is probably earlier than any of the sources to which I have been referring. Significantly, Demieville wonders whether Sailgharak�a, because of his frequent use of comparisons, should not be called a \"diir�tiintika\" (1 954: 339 n. 2), and he notes that Sailgharak�a's Yo giiciirabhiimi is mentioned in a work, the Ch 'u yao ching I±\\llfUJ[ (T. 212),771 attributed to the Dharmatrata who was a prominent Dar�tantika in the Vibhii�ii (1954: 406 n. 3). Another 771 Demieville describes this as \"Ia partie en prose de I' Udiinavarga\" (Demieville 1954: 406 n. 3)."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"281 text the original Sanskrit title of which was perhaps Yo giiciirabhurni is the Ta rno to 10 ch 'an ching it�?HjH,,- *! (f. 618);772 the Chinese title suggests a connection with Dharmatriita, but the identity of the Diir�tiintika Dharmatriita and the author of this text is questionab1e.773 Perhaps these other Yo giiciirabhurnis may contain some clues concerning the still obscure relationships among the philosophers, texts, and arguments variously de signated as Sautriintika, Diir�tiintika and Yogiiciira, and between this group and the mainstream of Sarviistiviida, from which they emerged. 772Yamabe is currently studying this text and has been kind enough to identify several occurrences in it of the word bi/a (e.g., T. 618: 316c23; 321a17; 322a8; 323aI5). 773Willemen summarizes Lin (1949: 314-351) as distinguishing three diffe rent Dharmatratas: the Dar�tantika Dharmatrata or Bhadanta of the Vibhii�ii; the author of the SaTflyuktiibhidharrnahrdaya and the commentary on the Paiicavastuka; and the one connected with the Ta rno to 10 ch 'an ching (Willemen 1975: xv). Yamada devotes a very long section to the identity of the various Dharmatratas (1959: 416-437), but in the end he seems unwilling to say definitely that they are different people (437). Lamotte, on the other hand, accepts Lin's opinion ( 1988: 696)."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"282 BmLIOGRAPHY Chinese Sources A p'i ta rna chii she fun �iiJm�)fiH��� (= Abhidharrnakasabhii�ya).
