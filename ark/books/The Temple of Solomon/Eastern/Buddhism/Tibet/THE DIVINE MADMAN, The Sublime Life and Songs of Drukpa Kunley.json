Whatever the historical credibility of these stories may be, they deserve our full attention for two reasons: first, because Drukpa Kunley counts among the most celebrated Adepts of the Himalayan countries, and second, because he belonged to the tradition of \"Crazy Wisdom,\" of which precious little is known in the West. Like that other great and in the West better known Tibetan Adept Milarepa (1040-1123), Drukpa Kunley was a \"madman\" (smyon-pa), an Enlightened \"eccentric.\" But unlike Milarepa, who was a celibate teaching by means of poetry and song, Drukpa Kuliley used p,oetry, song, dance, humor, drink, and not least sex to Teach his contemporaries the great Lesson of spiritual life: that the individual being, with its countless likes and dislikes, is constantly immersed in the universal Reality-Bliss beyond all personal preferences, feelings, and thoughts; that the phenomenal world (samsara) is indeed coessential with the transcendental Reality (nirvana). Drukpa Kunley, in the style of all the \"divine madmen\" before and after him, was a relentless critic of what the modern Crazy Adept Da Free John calls the \"usual man\"~whether he has donned a monk's garb or labors in the field. Drukpa Kunley mocked the secular and religious establishment, railed against commonplace morality and conventionalism, and lashed out against the narrow-mindedness of the earthling who does little more than stake out and defend his own insular existence. The Spiritual Master is indeed a voice that rises in this wilderness, to Awaken every neighbor from the illusion of his acre of land, his ordinary pond, his body-mind. It is a necessary voice, the voice that sounds whenever the Truth of human experience is Revealed to one who is Awake. There-fore, such a one speaks, even with urgency and anger. It is"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 the prophetic voice, the awful shout, expressed with all the gestures of frustrated Divinity.1 The motivation for Drukpa Kunley's unusual exploits was not personal gain or self-aggrandizement, but the spontaneous desire to Enlighten others. \"What I do is not the way I am, but the way I teach\" 2 is Master Da 's explanation of the Crazy Adept's unorthodox Teaching methods. ~'Care-free renuncia-tion, an excess of compassidn, total lack of inhibition, skilful use of shock-therapy, tears and laughter, are the specific characteristics of the divine madman,\" writes the translator of this volume (p. 28). In the West, but also in the East-wherever religious fun-damentalism or a dualistic metaphysics holds reign, spiritual life is characteristically viewed in opposition to material, bodily existence. If it is regarded as legitimate at all, as it barely is in our society, it is generally promoted as an other-worldly, ascetical, and ethereal pursuit. Such spirituality is based on the presumption that Man is a disembodied, unfeeling, sexless, and relationless entity. · Crazy Wisdom Adepts have an altogether different view of Man and life in general. For them, Enlightenment is. a whole-bodily Realization that does not presuppose a world-negative attitude, a disposition of mystical inversion, and esoteric ascent of awareness. They know Reality to be here and now and nondistinct from the creative struggle of life. As Master Da Free John writes: We must surrender to and into the Present God. God is not elsewhere .in relation to us now. God is always Present, Alive as all beings, Manifest as the total world. Our obligation is not to invert and go elsewhere to God, nor to extrovert and exploit ourselves in the self-possessed or anti-ecstatic mood that presumes God to be absent or non-existent. Our obligation is to Awaken beyond our selves, beyond the phenomena of body and mind, into That in which body and mind inhere. When, we are thus Awakened, our lives become l.

That Way of Life is not bound to this world or any other world, nor to any form of attention in body or mind. Rather, the Way of Life is Ecstatic, God-Made, Free, Radiant, and always already Happy.J Although Drukpa Kunley, being a Buddhist, did not use the term \"God,\" the mood of his Teaching is nevertheless akin to that of Master Da. By his own testimony always '\"relaxing in the stream ofevents\" (p. 93) and \"never working, letting reality hang loosely\" (p. 133), Drukpa was continually and spon-taneously communicating the great Truth of\"Emptiness\"-that \"whatever arises is the Path of Release\" (p. 133). This is what 'Master Da calls seventh-stage Wisdom. One who abides in the Self of God in the seventh stage of life is A wake to God under all conditions. He inheres in God through Self-Realization (the moment to moment re-cogni-tion of attention) and, as the Self, inheres in God as Infinite Radiant Bliss. The Self is Awake to the Radiance of God. All objects, all arising conditions are found to be a transparent Play on the Radiant Immensity of the Divine Person. Thus, in the seventh stage of life, the soul inheres in God as the Self, and the Self inheres in God through re-cognition of everything in God. Therefore, in the seventh stage of life, the soul is Awake as Love, or Ecstatic Worship of the Transcendental and All-Pervading Divine Person. All inwardness is transcended. All obsession with experiences, objects, and others is transcended. There is constant re-cognition of all arising conditions of experience, but all the While there is natural abiding in the Ecstatic Love of God through radical intuition of the Condition of everything. Thus, in the seventh stage of life, the arising of attention and experience is not at all prevented. The soul Awakens from its exile in the world and its seclusion in the heart. 3.

Attention has been Transformed, so that it is simply the Radiance of the Self, rather than the binding gesture of an independent consciousness.4 From the Realizer's aerial view of existence, the world process is essentially chaotic, nonsensical, and utterly unde-pendable. Where the conventional, ego-entrenched . mind anxiously clings to meanings of its own making, and thereby exposes itself to repeated frustration and suffering, the Enlightened being sees the non-binding nature of all' arising conditions-and encounters them with a sense of irrepressible humor. Perceiving God or Reality equally in everything, he neither shies away from anything nor becomes obsessed with any experience or idea. Because he is radically and irrevocably Free, he can also abstain from them without repressing any latent desires or tendencies. For the Realizer, life is Divine Creativity or Play (lila). In the language of Sufism, he is \"drunk with God,\" which sacred inebriation makes him immune to the \"poison of the world.\" In his God-intoxication or Ecstasy, however, he is prone to behave at odds with the all-too-sober world of social convention. In the eyes of the world, therefore, he is a radical, an anarchist or eccentric-a lunatic. His very existence calls into question the established order. Living, as he does, out of the plenitude of the Whole, he has no need for any self-limitation. His entire life is a towering symbol, a constant demonstration, of the fact that the limitations the \"usual man\" presumes are merely neurotic strategies to introduce a semblance of stability and orderliness into the incessant flux of events that constitutes phenomenal existence. The \"divine madman\" demonstrates that it is not necessary to sleep eight hours a day to feel good, or to eat three meals a day to maintain the body in a fit condition, or to abstain from sexual intercourse to promote spiritual growth. By his anoma-lous and erratic behavior he spotlights the absurdity of all fixed, man-made rules and prescriptions, whether they are designed to 4.

His very unusual-ness serves as a mirror to evince the intrinsic lopsidedness of conventional experiencing, thinking, feeling, and doing. He is an iconoclast who is wont to smash all our carefully_ erected conventional images of the world. In the light of his sublime Realization; our ideas about life, our pet theories, and our venerable customs are all seen to be merely huge prisons built on sand. · , Conventional religiosity and spirituality are not exempted from the Crazy Adept's criticism and ridicule. Nothing is sacred to him who moves in, .and is moved by, the Sacred itself. Whatever springs from the human mind or heart can never be more than an effigy-a fragile image of the Real. And the God-Realized Adept, who is at .one with the Real, will not suffer substitutes. He has emerged from the ·dark cave with its phantom shadows, and his whole life acts as a reminder that mankind's true place is in the Divine Light. In India such a great being is also known as an avadhuta. The esoteric significance of this word is explained in ,the Kularnava-Tantra. ,(chapter X) as follows: · a = the Immutable (akshara) va = the Excellent (varenya) dhu = shaken off (dhuta) the fetters of the world ta = \"That Thou art\" (tat tvam asz) Thus, each syllable is a pointer to the transcendental Realization of the avadhuta. This is how the Siddha-Siddhanta-Paddhati (chapter VI), one of the earliest Hathayoga texts, describes the Crazy Adept: He who is firmly stationed in the center of the world, devoid of all [fearful] trembling, whose freedom-from..dejection [serves as] his loin cloth and kharpara-stone-he is styled an avadhuta (v. 5). Whose limit is [naught but] the Supreme Consciousness, whose knowledge of the [Ultimate] Object [serves as] his sandals, and wfiose great vow (serves as] his antelope skin-he is style(! an avadhuta (v. 7). Whose Light of Consciousness and Supreme Bliss [serve as] his pair of earrings, who has ceased recitation with a rosary-he is styled an avadhuta (v. 9). ·"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 Who moves with his inner-being into the Unthinkable, into the remote Region within, who has that very Place as his undergarment-he is ~tyled an avadhuta (v. 12). Who always turns round fully into. the very center of himself and who views the world with equanimity-he is styled an avadhuta (v. 15). ' Who is firmly established in his own Luminosity, who is the Lustre of the nature of the Bright,. who delights in the world through Play-he is sty!ed an avadhuta (v. 19). · Who is sometimes an enjoyer, sometimes a renouncer, sometimes a nudist or like a demon, sometimes a king, and sometimes well-behaved-he is ·styled an avadhuta (v. 20).5 The last stanza makes direct reference to his protean nature. He is a trickster who can turn himself into anything at all. He assumes no fixed roles and statuses. One day, or perhaps one minute, he will act the beggar, and the next moment he will behave like an emperor. Thus, Hari Giri Baba (twentieth century), of Vaijapur in Aurangabad district, India, was well known for occasionally dressing qp like a king. He would wear silk and brocade, expensive shoes, and a stately turban and expect to be treated like royalty. And then again he would go about naked like the poorest beggar. · Understandably, discipleship under such a God-Realized Adept is a hard school, but conceivably also the most direct way to Realization. For, the student will have to aband~n all ideas of predictability and emotional security. His only assurance is that the Adept will do his utmost to serve his Awakening. The devotee's principal task is to recognize in his Teacher an Agent of the Enlightenment Process and simply surrender to him as such.

Such is the ordinary spiritual seeker .... But the Master waits for his true disciple to come and submit to him.7 The disciple or devotee must come to understand that there is absolutely nothing to hold on to. In his surrender to the Adept, he has to learn perfect self-reliance; or rather, Self-reliance. Until then he will be tested again and again. For, it is only when one is totally immersed in the Bliss of the Whole that one realizes, moment to moment, the non-binding nature of all arising phenomena. When the famous Buddhist scholar-saint Naropa approached his teacher-to-be, Tilopa, for instruction, the latter took him to a place where they met a prince in a chariot. Tilopa suggested that if he had a disciple, that disciple would drag the nobleman out of his chariot and manhandle him. Naropa, who had complete trust in the Wisdom of his newfound teacher, unhesi-tatingly followed this indirect command. He almost lost his life in the process because he was swiftly overpowered by the prince's · bodyguard. Tilopa healed his wounds and then in-structed him that \"the deer of the body which believes in an I\" deserves to be killed. Other similarly dramatic and unconven-tional lessons followed. On one level, the story of Naropa's spiritual tests is an allegory, though Crazy Adepts have been suffers in dilemma, contracted upon himself at every level of the being from all relations and from the condition of relationship itself. \"He is the ancient one visible in the Greek 'myth,' who was the universally adored child of the gods, who rejected the loved-one and every form of love and relationship, who was finally condemned to the contemplation of his own image, until he suffered. the fact of eternal separation and died in infinite solitude.\" (Da Free John, The Knee. of Listening, rev. ed.

Life is movement, but the ego in its constant anxiety to place and secure itself in this eternal flux creates borders, fences, and walls where there are none.· The ego itself is an illusion of solidity and stability. Consequently, it is the main target of the Crazy Adept's attack. There is a story about Neem Karoli Baba (?-1973), who one evening was squatting in ·the street. A delegation of self-important notables came along to pay their respects to him. He invited them to sit down with him right there and then. It was not until they had done so, with much reluctance, that he consented to get up and accompany them to his nearby hermitage. Swami Saniarth, also known as Akkalkot · Maharaj (?~1878), used to live in the home of one of his disciples~ He would cause much upset by his eccentric behavior, especially to the disciple's wife, who was only a reluctant devotee. The Swami would often touch and thereby \"pollute\" the food before an offering could be made to the Divine, or teed the cows the precious grain, or pour water into the hearth: On one occasion he even expelled his disciple's family When his pupil was out of town, and it took much pleading before the great Teacher changed his mind. All 'these wayward acts are undoubtedly profoundly significant. But in every instance there is a deliberate infringement of egoic expectations, a bursting of customary forms of self-limitation. Most Westerners, having been educated to worship reason and rational order, may find it particularly difficult to under-stand Crazy Wisdom and the Teaching methods and behavior of Crazy Adept~. Yet, there is a little-known tradition of \"divine madmen\" even within Christianity-a predominant western · religion.· Bul, estFa:nged as we are from the religious roots of our culture, we know nothing of the living wisdom of those who followed the \"glad tidings\" of Jesus of Nazareth at the margins"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 of the conventional (or orthodox) religious ethos ..

The biographies of Tibetan saints are written in three distinct styles. The 'external biography' gives us factual information about the saint's life: where he was born; his youth; how the change in his mind took place; how he renounced the eight worldly preoccupations (praise and blame, loss and gain, pleasure and pain and notoriety and fame); how he gained an understanding ofkarma; how he met his teacher and took refuge in the Lama; how he practised his moral precepts, study, and meditation, to gain both relative and absolute compassion; how through the maintenance ofhis SAMAYA vows and his accomplishment of the two stages of Tantric practice, he brought his body, speech, and mind to full enlightenment.

An uncensored account of the Lama's activity likely to raise all sorts of doubts and fears in the minds devotees. Also, it is secret, a mystery, because a Buddha's. existence resolves the paradoxes and dualities of being. The way Drukpa Kunley acts makes us understand how the Three Precepts of the Three V chicles (Hinayatla, Mahayana and Vajrayana) can be combined without any contradiction. We should understand that in his secret biography Drukpa Kunley takes his consorts like Milarepa, who took Tseringma to assist him in the final production of co-emergent bliss and wisdom in enlightenment. Wherever the Master finds his consorts, his great bliss awakens the Dakitii's natural insight. Saraha, after a long tenure at Nalanda University, took an arrow-smith's daughter (a Dakini) as his consort, and said: Only tlOW am I a truly pure Bhikshu.

His style, his humour, his 'earthiness, his compassion, his manner of relating to peo-ple, won him a place in the hearts of all the Himalayan peoples-the Sikkimese, the Assamese, the Ladakhis, the Nepalis, the Kunnupas, and the Lahaulis. He may not have been the greatest of scholars or metaphysicians, although he left some beautiful literature behind him, but he is the saint closest to the hearts of the common people, the Buddha to whom they feel most akin.

It is the work of a contem-. porary Bhutanese monk and scholar fulfilling the current need of Himalayan Buddhists for a new presentation of Drukpa Kunley's crazy-wisdom. This need arises at a time of rapid change when traditional forms are suspect-much as they were in Fran\\ois Rabelais's France. It appearea to us that the unique ingredients of this hagiography, a positive attitude to sex, an antipathy to organized religion and priestcraft, and the anarchic life-style of an itinerant mystic, would provide an ideal vehicle to carry the Tibetan Budd-hist Tradition to those who would never read a formal exposition of the doctrine. In the belief that the significance of Tantra has important implications outside the formal system of its practice, and wishing to inform and entertain those already committed to the Tradition, we have taken this opportunity to make a 'secret' biography available to western readers. Hitherto, the reformist oriented holders of theTantric Lineages have observed the strictures adjuring secrecy of Tantric literature; the unreformed schools have always had a more liberal attitude. Although we expect an adverse reaction from Buddhist schools adhering closely to the Buddha Sakyamuni's teaching in the 'First Turning. of the Wheel', we hope that the interest in the Tantras this translation excites, the misconceptions that it removes, and the insight and inspiration that it infuses, will vindicate us.

To this list Drukpa Kunley added profane and monastic sexuality, abuse of authority by privileged archs, exploitation of the ignorant and superstitious, occupation with peripheral religious concerns, wealth, fame, and many other forms of'spiritual materialism'. aim of both Saraha and Drukpa Kunley was to free human spirit's divinity from slavery to religious tions, and moral and ritual conventions, that had been designed to support spiritual endeavour (see page Both these Yogins, as exemplars of the · ascetic path, believed that .total renunciation and ment, including detachment from religion and its tions, were necessary conditions for perfect happiness.

The stories ofDrukpa philandering should be read with this in mind, and become evident why the craft with which he ex-pressed his desire is irreproachable. To impute prurient motivation to the Adept is to totally misconstrue the dy-namic of his existence, and a prurient delight or disgust on the reader's part will indicate a failure to understand one of 's great mysteries and an essential message of the Tantras: the blissful nature of all phenomena is realized in the union of duality (subject/object, consciousness/sensory stimuli, male/female). Whether his consort is a human being or a sensory field, the Adept participates in a consummate union of skilful means (male) and awareness (female), compas-sionate skilful means awakening the awareness potential of the 'Empty' female counterpart. In this union, the Tantric Mysteries, symbolized in mandalas of gods and goddesses, are revealed. His sexual activity is only a part of his craft of releasing people from ignorance - the universal psychosis that occludes the Buddha-nature inherent in us all - and eradicating the fixed notions of who we are and what we should and should not do. The genius of his therapeutic craft lies in spontaneous speech and action that awakens awareness of an authentic existential reality. Outrage and laughter are the skilful means he employs to shock people out of their lethargic acceptance of the neurotic status quo of their minds, and out of their attachment to conventional forms. All Drukpa Kunley's relationships are determined by the craft of his desire to attain his own and others' simultaneous and continuous enlightenment. Drukpa Kunley attained Buddhahood as a result of the arduous, highly disciplined training in listening, pondering, and meditating, which he received in the austere environ-ment of the Tibetan monastic academy, following the instructions and precepts, and receiving the authentic inner initiations and empowerments of the Lamas of his school.

But once he had attained his goal, at an exceptionally young age, he transcended the boundaries between the different schools; he became the universal mystic. The monasteries ofDrepung, Galden and Tsurphu, which he ridiculed, all recall his visits with great affection. Jealousy of one's choseti method of spiritual evolution functions, initially, like a tin pipe placed over a seedling to protect it from the ravages of sheep or rabbits, but, finally, it becomes necessary for the nt>ophyte to stand alone, free of all social supports and psychic crutches, as the Guru demonstrates. This glorious isolation, in the world but not of it, is one definition of the indefinable Great Perfection (Dzokchen) and the Magnificent Stance (Maha-mudra, Chakchen), whichoutside the schoolroom are syno-nyms for Drukpa Kunley's spiritual attainment (see pages 113-14). Drukpa Kunley has become more than an historical figure. In Bhutan he is a culture hero around whom a web of stories and legends, facts an:d fictions, have been spun. Tibetan beer-house raconteurs use his name interchange-ably with the less than holy Agu Tomba, the lewd secular character who recurs in Tibetan folklore to instruct in popular wisdom. But in the abundance of authentic tales told of him, he is the archetypal divine madman, whose personality is formed by the imperatives of the mythic hero of this mode of spiritual being. These imperatives are found embedded in the legends of the Eighty Four Indian Maha-: siddhas, in the stories of the plethora of divine crazies who appeared during the flowering of the Tibetan · (fourteenth to sixteenth centuries), and even today in villagers' highest expectations of their Pagala Babas saints). Care-free renunciation, an excess of compassion, total lack of inhibition, skilful use of shock-therapy, and laughter, are the specific characteristics of the n•v•nr· madman.

So although, initially, western readers may be shocked to find sex and scripture confounded, Tibetans are probably more sensitive to the Jherapeutic effect of the stories. . In the second half of this book, Drukpa Kunley is seen in Bhutan preoccupied with a peculiar activity that needs some explanation. In the sixteenth century, the people of Bhutan still lived under the spell of animist superstition, and it was Prukpa Kunley's dut,yand pleasure to enslave or destroy ;the.

The different species of demons can best be explained as configurations of yarious natural, elemental forces affecting the minds of human beings, and inseparable from the fear and instinctual responses that they incite. The seat of these forces may be inside the body or without. For example, the demon of a mountain pass can be a conform:,ttion of the latent powers of phenomena of cold, snow, wind, and high altitude, projected form. and character by the common ex· perience and imagination of many fearful, exhausted, an:d triumphant men crossing the pass.

Our hero's full personal name is Kunga Legpa'i Zangpd, which is contracted to Kunga Legpa, or simply Kunleg (Kunley). His title 'Drukpa' indicates that he belongs to the Drukpa Kahgyu School, and that he is associated with Bhutan. 'Master ofTruth' (Chos-rje) indicates his mastery of the Dharma, the Buddhas' Law and its practice. 'Lord of Beings' ('Gro-ba'i mgon-po) is an epithet of the Bodhisattva of Compassion as the liberator of gods, men, titans, beasts, hungry ghosts, and fiends. Since he is a Buddha, and Guru Preceptor, to numerous of his contemporaries, and to his disciples of succeeding generations, he is called 'Lama'. The title 'Naljorpa' (Yogin in Sanskrit, Yogi in the vernacular) identifies him as an itinerant renunciate and Adept profi-cient in meditation and magical ma~ipulation; literally,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Divine Madman 31 ,<.,.A,.,.,,.

'Adept' is a rendering of Druptop (siddha), one who has both relative magical powers and realization of s ultimate nature. The last of Drukpa Kunley's epithets, Jadral (bya-bral), which I have rather flippantly translated as 'Duty-Free', means that he abides in the free-§pace ofMahamudra, wherein action is called Non-Action: liis motion is in such harmony with the universe that it uires no effort or striving; spontaneous and uninhibited, it transcends our concepts of work or activity. Three other titles, often misunderstood, deserve definition. 'Precious One' (Rimpoche) is the form that devotees use to address their Lama, and serfs used to address their ecclesiastical overlords. 'Tulku' (Incarnation) has a profound metaphysi-cal reality - it indicates the transforming emanation of the Buddha-Essence-and in a political context it denominates ~he titular head of a monastery. 'Gomchen', for which I have been unable to find a pithy equivalent, is the name given to an ascetic meditator who spends his life, or the major part of it, in a cave or hut, often sealed, in the jungle or a Himalayan fastness.

The Naljorpa,4 Drukpa Kunley, came from an extremely exalted family and spiritual lineage. In latter day Buddhist India, there were many great Adepts, foremost of whom was Narotapa.5 Narotapa decided to gain rebirth in the Land of the Snows to spread the teaching that gives mean-ing and purpose to people's lives. In that land of the Bodhisattva Lotus-in-Hand, 6 near Y agyal in the east of the province ofTsang, over the pass of the Mountain-Demon Complete Contentment, in a place called Nyangto Saral, there was a large nomad encampment. In that camp lived a man named Zurpo Tsape of the family of Gya7 with his wife, Maza Darkyi.

Through a synthesis of the meaning of all the oral instruc-tion he had received, he discovered the key to all realization: BE AWARE! GUARD THE MIND!

He went straight to the market place, where he found a hundred-year-old hag with white hair and blue eyes, who was bent at the waist and had not so much as a single tooth in her head.

Nomads, farmers, . officers, monks, nuns, Naljorpas, devotees, traders, • pilgrims were all gathered together in the Holy City. 'Listen to me, all you people!' shouted the Lama. 'I Drukpa Kunley of Ralung, and I have come here · without prejudice, to help you all. Where can I find the chung19 and the most beautiful women? Tell me!' The crowd was startled, and muttered to one 'This madman says he's come here for the sake of all and then asks where he can find alcohol and women! kind of piety is that? He should be asking who is the Lama, which is the most desirable monastery, and where religion flourishing most strongly. But he has no questions. Most likely he's the type of religious freak binds girls to the Wheel ofTruth rather than demons!' There was a man in the crowd with a white skin, a face, a head like a blacksmith's hammer, staring eyes, lips like a sheep's intestines, a forehead like an. turned begging bowl, and a neck as thin as a horse's tail a vast goitre growing out of it. He shouted back at Lama, 'You may try to tell us you're a man, you idiot, you surely have no home; you may tell us you're a bird, you have no perch; you may call yourself a deer, but have no forest; you may call yourself a beast, but you no lair; you may call yourself a devotee, but you have · sect; you may call yourself a monk, but you have monastery; you may call yourself a Lama, but you have throne.

When Pebdak's wife brought her son, the child imme-diately began to shake and tremble. 'Stay still! Don't be afraid!' the Lama commanded, and he asked Pebdak to bring a black lassoo that he had seen hanging upon a pillar. He put the noose round the child's neck as it lay in its mother's lap and said, 'If you don't lick my cock today, my name isn't Drukpa Kunley! Now down to the river!' Drag-ging the child behind him with the lassoo, followed by the parents wailing, swallowing dust, chewing stones, and tearing their hair, he reached the river bank. 'If you dare to return here again, you'll get this same treatment,' said .the Lama holding the child at arm's length by the neck and then hurling him into the centre of the swirling stream. Suddenly the child's corpse was seen to change into a black dog with a gaping red mouth which snarled, 'You've no compassion, Drukpa Kunley!' as it swam to the opposite bank. 'That was your son!' he told the parents, and gaining complete faith in the Lama, they returned to their house blameless and free from fear. Back in Pebdak's house the Lama taught this method of Destroying Evil Influences that might threaten their children: 'The baby crying in its cradle at midnight, Signifies father's penetration ofhis wife-Calm the baby by giving it nuts to eat.

After giving this teaching, the Lama told Pebdak and his wife that they should expect another son by the same time next year. 'Please name the child now,' Pebdak requested. 'You may not be here next year.' 'Call him Abundant Harvest, because he will be the origin of a flourishing line,' said the Lama. When Pebdak's wife heard this prediction, she offered the Lama her jewelry as a token of her gratitude, and Pebdak himself presented the Lama with a box of fifty gold coins . and a turquoise.

He returned the gold and turquoise also, but Pebdak insisted that he keep them in order to bring good fortune upon his family and to remove any obstacles that would arise in his path. The Lama finally accepted the gifts with the avowed intention of· offering them to Tsongkhapa. He put the turquoise into the aperture of his Thunderbolt, 25 took the gold in his hand, and left Samye for Lhasa. In the market place at Lhasa all eyes boggled at his treasure. 'If you want gold, pay with turquoise. If you want turquoise, pay in gold!' he shouted. 'You'll find no buyer for so much gold,' he was told. 'And the turquoise is stuck in a strictly sacredplace, so no one will want it.' But interested to see what the Lama would do with it, a crowd followed him. He went straight to the Temple of the Glorious Goddess, where he found seven girls dancing and singing the praises of the goddess: 'Enshrined in this golden pagoda Protectress, Only Mother, Glorious Goddess,26 Possessor of the Eye of Wisdom, To you we girls sing praises!'"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Divine Madman 69 'You sing very sweetly,' the Lama told them.

Leaving the temple he set off to visit the Bodhisattva of Intelligence, Tsongkhapa. As soon as he arrived at the Ramoche Temple, the monks asked him what he was doing there. 'I've come for audience with the Buddha Tsongkhapa,' he told them. 'Do you still only have your balls as offerings?' jibed the monks. 'No. This time I have gold to offer him,' responded the Lama. 'Then you can gain audience immediately.' 'Yah! Yah!' laughed the Lama. 'If one has gold to offer, the way is immediately opened.' And he thought to himself that he should open these monks' eyes for them.

'It is not comfortable to wear around my neck. I have no pocket put it into, and I don't want to carry it in my hand. Better tie it around my penis which is quite clean and has nn1·n1r•\"' to carry.' So he wrapped it around his penis and went to market. 'Look! Look!' he shouted. 'If you have fifty pieces you can gain audience with the Buddha Tsongkhapa self. He may even give you one of these!' And he waved his member with the thread around it in the air. Now in the market at Lhasa, lived an innkeeper, who was named Lhadron. She was a notorious thief, tricking tra.aer·s. out of their goods and their money. A Y amdrok trader was staying there at that time, and his hostess was intending to replace his amber with some imitations. The Lama was aware of this and went to the inn for a drink in the chung parlour. 'Everybody is happy here,' he said. 'The hostess must be an excellent woman! And since everybody's tongue is loose, the chung must be first class. There's an old saying, \"Good chung is good for the health, and good stories are good for the mind.\" If you give me some quality chung, I will tell you a first class story.' 'Tell us your story!' said the innkeeper. Once upon a time, in the upper part of a valley called Nangyul, lived a trickster called Lying Greed and his two sons, Duwa and Duchung. In the valley below lived a poor man called Faint Heart. These two were companions in their constant search for sustenance. One day in their travels from valley to valley they were resting beneath a tree when they noticed that the tree seemed to glitter.

Consider this carefully.' 71 'Today through a coincidence of virtue and luck, we have found this treasure,' Lying Greed opined. 'And since it is your merit more than mine that has caused this good fortune, I shall give a three day feast of chung and meat in your honour. Just now I will take the gold and divide it fairly into two parts. But beware! good friend. This gold could be an illusion, a trick of gods or demons.' 'That is highly unlikely,' Faint Heart said sceptically. 'But if it is an illusion, there is little that we can do about it.' Faint Heart went home. But Lying Greed took the gold, hid it in the ground in a secret place, and refilled the pot with sawdust. When Faint Heart returned, he found Lying Greed crying under the tree. 'What is the matter, friend?' he asked. 'I told you that the gold could be an illusion, and so it turned out,' Lying Greed moaned. 'You must be lying,' said Faint Heart. 'I never heard of such a thing before. But fven if it is true, there's nothing to cry about.' Lying Greed plied his friend with chung, and com-manded his boys to dance for him. 'Friend, your sons dance like phantoms or figments of a dream,' Faint Heart commented. 'It certainly makes a fine· spectacle.' .

'Your two sons have turned into monkeys,' Faint Heart moaned. 'You remember when they were dancing at house last week I said that they looked like phantoms? it seems that I was right!' 'I never heard of boys changing into monkeys,' Lying Greed in scorn. 'Please return my sons to me at once.' Faint Heart replied: 'Lying Greed, my friend, please listen to me!

'This must be divine retribution for exchanging the gold dust for sawdust. But I confess! I will bring the gold dust to you. Now please give me back my two sons.' 'Bring the gold dust first,' Faint Heart told him. 'Then I may do something for you.' Lying Greed retrieved the gold dust, divided it into two, gave Faint Heart his portion, and regained his sons.

Where is your home and what are you doing here?' 'I live on the pass,' she explained, 'and I come down into the valley to find food and clothing.' 'What do you eat and what do you wear?' the Lama asked her. 'I eat human flesh and wear human skin!' she replied menacingly.

At that moment the Lama returned and bit the ear of the old woman's son who had disobeyed his instruction and opened the door prematurely. The unfortunate son was struck dumb, but eventually he found his tongue and praised the Lama with thanksgiving and deep devotion. 'Whether you are grateful or not is irrelevant,' the Lama told him. 'Your mother is now living in a Pure Buddha Land, and that is the important thing.' Travelling down from Paro Valley towards the Indian plains, the Lama passed a house in which the funeral feast of a woman called Akyi was being celebrated. Seeing him pass by, the relatives of the deceased called to him to join them in their drinking. 'It's good to drink chung in the hot season,' he said, and straightaway began throwing it back.

'No one give him lodging so that he has to stay up in the ruins. We'll take him food up there.' So, unable to find lodging in the village, the Lama went up to the ruins to sleep, and at midnight he was attacked by a demon that had nine goitres piled one above the other growing out of his neck. Kunley thrust his Flaming Thun-derbolt ofWisdom up the demon's rear and sent him fleeing up the hill. Even today near the Orgyen Rock, one can smell burnt meat and hear cries of pain. And although there used to be eighty tax payers in Kunzangling, because the people refused Drukpa Kunley hospitality, now there are only four.

After she had recei instruction in both sexual and spiritual intercourse, went up to Paro Chumphuk and stayed there for three in meditation. Finally, by a fortunate conjunction of Lama's grace and her own devotion, she gained a Body Light. .

She pre-tended not to feel it so he withdrew it and was about to leave her when she put her arms around him and drew him to her, so that he had no alternative but to take her. The following morning he went down to the market place where all the villagers were gathered, and shouted out for them to hear, 'Gokye Palmo pretended to be asleep when I wanted her.

This miracle was observed by many people, and that rock can still be seen preserved in the wall of the temple that was built there. Moving on, the Lama came to the head of the Jelai La pass (between Wong Dzong and Tongsar), and while he was wondering whether he should descend through Mang Dewa to Khyen Yul, he met an old man with a heavy load.

The Lama proceeded to hang his bow and arrow, and his dog, on a sunbeam. The sunbeam remained taut. 'Why does this sunbeam bend when it has only a robe hanging on it, when your sunbeam remains taut with a dog on it?' asked the puzzled abbot; 'Our degree of spiritual realization and detachment is the same,' Kunley told him. 'But the weight of your posses-sions and material comforts makes your magic heavier. I have a higher vision.' In spite of themselves, the assembly was deeply im-pressed and sighed with devotion. 'This Lama is Palden Drukpa himselfl' they said. 'Ngawong Chogyal has a vast power of blessing, but Drukpa Kunley is a Naljorpa un-paralleled and peerless.' And Drukpa Kunley's fame spread throughout the South, and later through U and Tsang in Tibet. One day Ngawong Chogyal said to Drukpa Kunley, 'Spring is here. It is becoming hot.

At Khawa Ngoshing the Lama found a flat flailing stone and inscribed these words upon it with his finger: 'Men pass to and fro together, but I have no companion, and my heart is sad.

'Listen to this • story.' ~ A long time ago in India in a kingdom called Nagrota\" ruled by a powerful and wealthy raja called Paladha, lived' two men named Bhasu and Dhasu. These two men alike in wealth, taste and reputation, and before their god, Mahadev, they had sworn an oath of fidelity to one another. Bhasu had an extremely beautiful wife whom ·· coveted. He justifi~d this by telling himself that the which he had sworn with Bhasu was invalid since possessed something he could not share.

I sentence you to give your beautiful wife to the man whose gold you stole, and you yourself will face death by burning.' A wood and tar tax was levied from the townspeople, a fire was lit, and Bhasu was cast into the flames. 'I can never be your wife,' cried Bhasu's wife to Dhasu. 'Your gold was returned and you know it. And now my innocent husband is being burnt alive. Please let me express myself sincerely for the sake of our old friendship.' 'The wedge ofkarma is very thin And even saints can face disaster. Destroyed by dependence upon a dishonest friend, Cheated by a friend's broken pledge, My husband is burnt, and my eyes fill with tears. Iflcould ever betray my husband's memory My mind is surely deluded!' With these words she threw herself into the flames with her husband. That is the origin of the custom of Suttee which is practised in India and Nepal to this day. 5 Not long after, Dhasu died of melancholia, his evil designs having failed to gain his mean ambition. Thus Dhasu, Bhasu, and his wife found themselves together in the court ofDharmaraj, Lord ofDeath and Judge ofKarma. 'Bhasu, you and your wife will be reborn as son and daughter of the Raja Paladha. You, Bhasu, will be reborn as the son of a swineherd who lives close to the palace,' judged Dharmaraj. And so it was.

Please tell me what unfortunate karma. has caused this miserable birth,' she begged. 'Bring the king's son and daughter here,' directed the Buddha. When they arrived, Buddha recounted the story of their past lives in detail, and all three of them, remembering those events, wept together. Dhasu threw himself at Buddha's feet, weeping and wailing. The Lord shaved the head of the miserable boy, gave him the name Pure Joy, and ordained him as a lay devotee. He was sustained by burnt tsampa smoke. Buddha promised thathe would finally gain • Buddhahood. . 'And that is the karma that hounds a man who blatantly steals another man's wife,' Drukpa Kunley told his audience.
