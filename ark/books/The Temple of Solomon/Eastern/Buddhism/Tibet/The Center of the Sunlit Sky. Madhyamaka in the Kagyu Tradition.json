He even became very specificabout what such an introduction should include and which texts should be con-sulted, so I could not but start taking this project more seriously. It rapidly grewfrom a mere introduction into quite an extensive volume of its own, partlybecause Rinpoche, at each of our meetings over the years, added topics to beincluded. Thus, my sincere gratitude and respect go to The Dzogchen PonlopRinpoche for his original idea and his continuous inspiration and guidancethroughout the entire project. Even greater is the kindness and skillfulness ofKhenchen Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, who for many years has guided West-ern students through the world of Tibetan Buddhist scriptures with their variousphilosophical systems and terminologies.

I never completed the traditional three-year med-itation retreat, so I have no realization either. And not being a native speaker ofeither English, Tibetan, or Sanskrit, I do not have sufficient command of any ofthese languages. In brief, there isn’t anything to qualify me to write a book likethis. In doing so, I have only tried to comply with the wish of The DzogchenPonlop Rinpoche.

Renowned for its poetry, it presents some of the mostprofound teachings of the Buddhist philosophical tradition in a lucid and sim-ple style, combining the view of emptiness with direct instructions for contem-plative practices of compassion.The author of the Bodhicary›vat›ra, as the text is titled in its original Sanskrit,is ⁄›ntideva, a great eighth-century Indian master from N›land› University.1The treatise is a very practical guide for those aspiring to actualize the practicesof the six p›ramit›s, or perfections: generosity, discipline, patience, exertion,meditation, and superior knowledge or prajñ›. Buddhist practitioners in India and Tibet have expounded, studied, and practiced the Bodhicary›vat›rain an unbroken tradition until today. Over thecenturies, great Buddhist masters of India and Tibet composed numerous com-mentaries and instructions on the text. Many masters not only wrote about thisfamous book, but also continuously taught this text to their students. One suchmaster is the most renowned wandering hermit Patrul Rinpoche, who taughtthis text at Dzogchen Shri Singha Shedra of the Dzogchen Monastery, and laterat his retreat area in the Dzachu region of eastern Tibet. Indeed, this textaddresses timeless issues, which are of critical importance to anyone who is seri-ously engaged in spiritual pursuits, and contemporary masters continue to writeabout it and teach it to their students. The Bodhicary›vat›rais presented in ten main topics or chapters: 1) Benefitsof Bodhicitta; 2)Purification; 3) Embracing Bodhicitta; 4) Awareness; 5) Vigi-lance; 6) Patience; 7) Perseverance; 8) Meditation; 9) Wisdom (prajñ›); and 10)Dedication.The exposition of the Madhyamaka, or the Middle Way philosophy, in theninth chapter is one of the classic presentations of this profound view and formsthe basis for elucidating the ŸÒnyatav›da, or teachings on emptiness, as taught byN›g›rjuna, the founder of the Middle Way school. One of the most detailed and complete commentaries on the Bodhicary›vat›rais the Ocean of the Dharma of the Great Vehicle2,composed by Pawo TsuklakTrengwa (1504–1566). He was a great teacher of the Kagyü lineage of Tibet andCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"was one of the two most important students of the Eighth Karmapa, MikyöDorje (1507–1554), a great scholar and meditation master who wrote over thirtyvolumes of commentaries and instructions on Buddhist sÒtras and tantras. The Kagyü lineage is rich in intellectual studies, especially in the areas of phi-losophy and logic, as well as in its tradition of practice instructions, famed fortheir directness. Teachers in this tradition use a balanced approach to lead stu-dents along the “middle way,” a distinctive method of the Kagyü lineage.Through study, combined with practice pursuant to these instructions, one maydevelop the wisdom that is the basis for transcending the neurotic confusion ofsa ̇s›ra. The scholarly tradition of the Kagyü lineage expanded rapidly during the timeof the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Karmapas. The author of this text, Pawo Rin-poche, lived during the peak of this period, and played a very important role inclarifying the intentions of Karmapa Mikyö Dorje and enriching the view of theKagyü Madhyamaka school. His contribution to Kagyü scholarship was thusvery important, and his writings are still studied today at different Kagyü shedras,including the main seat of His Holiness the Karmapa, Tsurphu, in Tibet, and atKarma Shri Nalanda Institute in Rumtek, Sikkim, India.The Bodhicary›vat›rais one of the few Indian Buddhist texts for which theoriginal Sanskrit has survived. It was first translated into Tibetan from Sanskritin the eighth century. Now, in the twenty-first century, we are especially fortu-nate to have many different translations of the root verses in English, as well astranslations of portions of some commentaries. I am delighted to present The Center of the Sunlit Sky, which includes a trans-lation of the commentary by Pawo Tsuklak Trengwa on the chapter of the Bod-hi cary›vat›ra on “Wisdom.” A special feature of this first publication in theNitartha Institute Series is an extensive introductory presentation of Madhya-maka in the Kagyü tradition by Dr. Karl Brunnhölzl. Karl Brunnhölzl is a highly qualified translator, interpreter, and teacher. Thisexcellent translation and comprehensive introduction to Madhyamaka in theKagyü tradition reflect his knowledge, wisdom, and extensive experience study-ing and presenting these materials for many years. In particular, he has studiedTibetan language and Buddhist philosophy and logic with Very VenerableKhenchen Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche and myself, as well as with many otherteachers. He has also translated numerous Tibetan texts into English and Ger-man. Karl has been one of the key translators and teachers at the Nitartha Insti-tute. This book gives, for the first time in a Western publication, a comprehensivepresentation of the unique Kagyü view of Madhyamaka. While going into greatdetail in his presentation of the view, Karl is still careful to address Madhyamakawithin a context of meditation. Special features of his detailed treatment include14The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"a discussion of Shentong in relation to Madhyamaka and a detailed considerationof differences between Kagyü and Geluk understandings of this philosophy ashighlighted in the works of Mikyö Dorje and Tsongkhapa.

I am grateful to have had the opportunity to teach the ninth chapter of Bod-hi cary›vat›raat Nitartha Institute Europe. Karl prepared the translation of thischapter for my class, along with that of the commentary by Pawo TsuklakTrengwa, and assisted with translation during my teaching. At that time, Karl andI discussed how important it would be to write an extensive introduction to thischapter when published in English. I am delighted by Karl’s remarkable accom-plishment. He has not only presented us with a wonderful translation, but alsoan outstanding introduction that truly elucidates the view of ⁄›ntideva throughthe teachings of the great Kagyü Madhyamaka masters.May this translation contribute to the genuine effort to transplant pure dharmain the West.

The brief answer tothis is that, despite the extensive materials on Madhyamaka that are currentlyavailable in the West, the overall picture of this Buddhist system in India andTibet is not nearly complete. A number of issues call for an attempt to fill insome gaps. First, with a few exceptions, the majority of books or articles onMadhyamaka by Western—particularly North American—scholars is based onthe explanations of the Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism.2Deliberately ornot, many of these Western presentations give the impression that the Gelugpasystem is more or less equivalent to Tibetan Buddhism as such and that thisschool’s way of presenting Madhyamaka (especially with respect to its Conse-quentialist3branch) is the standard or even the only way to explain this system,4which has led to the still widely prevailing assumption that this is actually the case.From the perspective of Indian and Tibetan Buddhism in general, nothing couldbe more wrong. In fact, the peculiar Gelugpa version of Madhyamaka is a minor-ity position in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, since its uncommon features are nei-ther found in any Indian text nor accepted by any of the other Tibetan schools.5Thus, the current situation in the West in no way represents the richness ofMadhyamaka views that existed in India and are still transmitted in all four majorTibetan Buddhist schools. Specifically, there is no general outline of the Madh-yamaka view as presented in the Kagyü school of Tibetan Buddhism in any West-ern language.6However, I would like to make it clear at the outset that this book is not aboutsectarianism or which view is the better one. Rather, it should be regarded as anattempt to shed some light on more facets of the living Indo-Tibetan Buddhisttradition and to introduce them to a wider Western audience. As the Buddhahimself always said, it is up to us which teachings we personally find most con-vincing and helpful for our lives.In addition, there is a rather common cliché that the followers of the Kagyüschool just chant rituals or sit in caves and three-year retreats to practice medi-Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"tation and lack any scholarly tradition. By presenting materials from a numberof mainly Karma Kagyü sources, I attempt to show that there definitely isa richscholarly and scriptural tradition in this school and to offer a glimpse of it.Marpa’s scholarly accomplishment, resulting from his twenty-one years ofstudying with many masters in India, is still evident in his numerous translationscontained in the Tibetan Buddhist canon, in both Kangyur7and Tengyur.8Notwidely known is that Milarepa studied intensively with Marpa before he set offfor his solitary retreats. His familiarity with advanced Buddhist terminology andconcepts can be seen in many of his vajra songs. Starting with Gampopa9(1079–1153), the school’s early masters wrote mainly works that focus on medi-tation practice. Before Gampopa met his principal teacher, Milarepa, he wasalready an accomplished master in the Kadampa10tradition, well known for itsrigorous educational training. He composed numerous texts on Mah›mudr›,and his Jewel Ornament of Liberation11is held in high esteem by all Tibetan tra-ditions. The First Karmapa Tüsum Khyenba12(1110–1193) studied extensively forabout two decades with most of the greatest masters of his time, including ChabaChökyi Senge13and Patsab Lots›wa,14before he became Gampopa’s student. TheSecond Karmapa Karma Pakshi (1206–1283) wrote many—now lost—volumes,including a text on valid cognition.15The Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje16(1284–1339) greatly contributed to the corpus of practice-oriented works, mainlythrough his famous Profound Inner Reality,17but he also wrote a number of morescholarly works, such as his Distinction between Consciousness and Wisdom,18atreatise on Buddha nature,19and a recently rediscovered commentary onN›g›rjuna’s Praise to the Dharmadh›tu. The Fourth Karmapa Rölpay Dorje20(1340–1383) was a prolific writer on logic and reasoning.The Sixth Karmapa Tongwa Tönden21(1416–1453) studied extensively withthe great Sakya master Rongtön Sheja Künrig22(1367–1449). From this timeonward, throughout Tibet, the Karmapas established a number of major Kagyümonastic colleges (shedra),23the main ones being Tagbo Legshay Ling24and SatamNyinje Ling.25According to Jamgön Kongtrul’sTreasury of Knowledge,26initially,the sources for the exegetical system of the sÒtra texts in the Kagyü lineage are forthe most part to be found in the Sakya tradition, specifically in the explanationsof Rongtön. The Karma Kagyü school’s independent exegetical tradition withregard to the great sÒtra texts started with the Seventh Karmapa’s27(1454–1506)Ocean of Texts on Reasoning28and his commentary on The Ornament of ClearRealization. This exegetical tradition reached its culmination in the extensiveworks of the Eighth Karmapa Mikyö Dorje29(1507–1554), who wrote commen-taries on four of the five traditional topics of sÒtra studies30as well as a numberof independent treatises on both sÒtras and tantras, over thirty volumes alltogether. The Ninth Karmapa Wangchug Dorje31(1556–1603), in addition to hisfamous three major texts on Mah›mudr›32and other works on tantra, wrote both18The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"brief and extensive commentaries on the five topics of sÒtra.33Also the Four-teenth and Fifteenth Karmapas, Tegchog Dorje (1798–1868) and Kakyab Dorje(1871–1922), were accomplished scholars, both involved in the nonsectarianRime34movement in Eastern Tibet; they composed numerous texts. Other greatscholars in the Karma Kagyü school who wrote their own commentaries andtreatises on both sÒtras and tantras include the Fifth and Sixth Shamarpas, Gön-cho Yenla35(1525–1583) and Chökyi Wangchug36(1584–1630), the First KarmaTrinlayba Choglay Namgyal37(1456–1539), the Second Pawo Rinpoche TsuglaTrengwa38(1504–1566), Tagbo Dashi Namgyal39(1512–1587), the Eighth SitupaChökyi Jungnay40(1699–1774), and Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye41(1813–1899),one of the main figures in the Rime movement.42The flourishing of this well-established scholarly tradition was somewhat weak-ened after the time of the Ninth Karmapa as a result of almost all its colleges beingclosed down by the Central Tibetan government. The most important exceptionto this was the college at Palpung43Monastery in eastern Tibet, founded by theEighth Situpa in 1727. Nevertheless, most of the classical Kagyü scriptures con-tinue to be studied and transmitted to the present day. Unfortunately, during theChinese takeover of Tibet, many of these texts became lost and were only partlyrediscovered in recent years. In 1981, the Sixteenth Karmapa Rangjung RigbayDorje44(1924–1981) reestablished the school’s tradition of monastic colleges byfounding the Karma ⁄rı N›land› Institute at his seat-in-exile in Rumtek (India).Since this time, an increasing number of Kagyü colleges have been opened inIndia and Nepal. In addition, since the early 1990s, Nıt›rtha International underthe direction of The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche is involved in preserving (onelectronic media), editing, and republishing all the major texts of the KarmaKagyü lineage, starting with its “eight great texts of sÒtra and tantra”45plus theirmain commentaries. More recently, Thrangu Rinpoche’s Vajra Vidya Institutein Sarnath, India, has also become involved in editing and republishing theKarma Kagyü scriptural inheritance. In the West, the eight great texts are grad-ually being translated into English and German and studied at Nıt›rtha Institutein Canada and Germany.There is still widespread misunderstanding about what Madhyamaka is and isnot, even—or maybe particularly—among Buddhists. These misconceptions aremostly accompanied by a great deal of resistance to what is often assumed to bemerely dry intellectual gymnastics. There are strong concerns as to whether theMadhyamaka approach has any practical value at all or is just outright nihilism.It seems that there are two main reasons for this attitude. In general, to put itmildly, we do not appreciate it when our treasured and often unconscious waysof looking at the world are brought into daylight and questioned, but this is pre-cisely what Madhyamaka does, relentlessly and thoroughly. Furthermore, espe-cially in the West, there are hardly any instructions on how to actually work withPreface 19Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"this approach in a personal rather than just a theoretical way, nor much instruc-tion on why this might be to our benefit.In other words, in order to appreciate Madhyamaka, we first need to under-stand how this approach can provide us a chance to vividly notice our rigid waysof viewing ourselves and the world. We may then acknowledge how this literallynarrow-minded outlook causes our many problems and our suffering.46It is cru-cial to see that Madhyamaka is not just another philosophical trinket that weadd on top of all the sophisticated conceptual garbage of which we have alreadytoo much anyway. Madhyamaka is not about adding more intellectual headaches,but loosening up and letting go of everything that gives us headaches in the firstplace. When we first look at the jungle of Madhyamaka refutations of all kindsof belief systems, they might seem quite alien and complicated. However, allthese views simply mirror the fixations and complications that we foster in ourown minds. Thus, what makes things complicated is not Madhyamaka itself butour inflexible and discursive mind. Actually, Madhyamaka is not at all aboutdoingsomething complex, new, or particular but about undoingin a very basicand profound sense. When we start to realize this, we might discover some gen-uine interest and even delight in unraveling the convoluted web of our ingrainedpatterns. It is these patterns that prevent us from fundamentally relaxing ourminds, finding relief from mental afflictions,47and being more kind toward our-selves and others, with whom we share the same basic problems. Thus, from apractical point of view, it is not Madhyamaka’s business to refute the strangebelief systems of other schools and people, most of whom lived hundreds of yearsago in quite different cultures and societies. Rather, we may consider these viewsas examples that can help us with finding out about our own beliefs and how theycause us trouble. Consequently, as Buddhist practitioners, it is a matter of apply-ing the Madhyamaka approach first and foremost to our own mental entrench-ments and trying to come out into the open.As for ⁄›ntideva’s Bodhicary›vat›ra, there surely exist numerous translationsof the whole text (both from the Tibetan and the Sanskrit) and especially itsninth chapter on knowledge.48The commentaries on which these translationsrely are some of the classic Indian commentaries (mostly Prajñ›karamati’s Bod-hicary›vat›rapañjik›), various commentaries from the Tibetan Gelugpa school,a single Sakya commentary,49and a single Nyingma commentary.50In a study ona few selected verses from the eighth and ninth chapters of the text, Williams(1998a) offers some glimpses into a variety of commentaries from all four schools.So far, though, there is no translation of a Kagyü commentary on ⁄›ntideva’sfamous ninth chapter into any language. Thus, the purpose of the present studyis to address these issues in the following ways.The first part of this book is an attempt to give a general and systematic out-line of Madhyamaka (and more specifically of its Consequentialist branch) in20The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 20"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"terms of ground, path, and fruition that is based on the original Indian texts andtheir understanding in the Tibetan Kagyü tradition. Throughout my research, Ihave always tried to directly rely on the main Indian Madhyamaka sources,51ineither the Sanskrit originals (if available) or their Tibetan translations. As for theTibetan commentaries on these texts, my presentation rests primarily on the twomajor Madhyamaka commentaries in the Karma Kagyü tradition. The teachersof this school say that if one wants to know how Madhyamaka in general and theConsequentialist system in particular is presented in the Karma Kagyü lineage,these are the two texts to study:• The first is a large commentary on Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrismbythe Eighth Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, called The Chariot of the Tagbo Siddhas.52It is not only a commentary on this one major work by Candrakırti. By refer-ing to a wide range of other Centrist texts as well, it treats all the crucial issuesin Madhyamaka in general. In particular, the Karmapa’s text includes andextensively comments on the entire long section in Candrakırti’s Lucid Words(his other main work) that defends Buddhap›lita and criticizes Bh›vaviveka,thus leading to the later distinction between Autonomists and Consequen-tialists.• The second text is an equally voluminous commentary on ⁄›ntideva’s Entranceto the Bodhisattva’s Way of Lifeby one of the Eighth Karmapa’s major disciples,Pawo Rinpoche Tsugla Trengwa. It is called Exposition of The Entrance to theBodhisattva’s Way of Life, the Essence of the Immeasurable, Profound, and VastOcean of the Dharma of the Great Vehicle. As well as being a detailed com-mentary on ⁄›ntideva’s text, it preserves many of the Eighth Karmapa’s gen-eral explanations on Madhyamaka.In the Kagyü tradition in general, both commentaries are the earliest and mostdetailed presentations of Madhyamaka and considered the standard works onthis subject. They were written at a time when the debate about the novel inter-pretation of the Madhyamaka system by Je Tsongkhapa Lobsang Tragba53(1357–1419) was still in full swing. However, Karmapa Mikyö Dorje’s text in par-ticular not only is a reaction to the position of Tsongkhapa and his followers butaddresses most of the views on Madhyamaka that were current in Tibet at thetime, including the controversial issue of “Shentong-Madhyamaka.” More impor-tant, it presents a Madhyamaka view that is not just a philosophical system buta view whose primary focus is its efficiency in serving as the basis and means forliberation and Buddhahood. The Karmapa’s work is distinctly Kagyü in that itamply illuminates the connection of Madhyamaka with Mah›mudr› and thesiddha tradition, in terms of both view and practice. The text quotes such Indianmah›siddhas as Saraha, Tilopa, and N›ropa, as well as the great Kagyü yogis ofPreface 21Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Tibet, such as Milarepa, Gampopa, Götsangba,54Jigden Sumgön,55and the FirstSangye Nyenba Rinpoche Dashi Baljor,56who was the Eighth Karmapa’s mainteacher and a great siddha. This approach is in itself an “online,” direct oralinstruction that is imparted simultaneously to reading the written commentary.One may struggle in the midst of all these Madhyamaka arguments and refuta-tions, and then suddenly there is a yogic song, which cuts through all these philo-sophical complexities right on the spot with a fresh breeze of nonconceptual ease.In this way, the Eighth Karmapa’s commentary is quite unique and at the sametime extremely profound.In addition, I draw from three other Kagyü sources on Madhyamaka. Thefirst two are by the famous Drugba Kagyü master Künkhyen Padma Karpo57(1527–1596) who, in terms of his Madhyamaka view, is considered to be a Con-sequentialist. These texts include• his commentary on The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life, called TheLamp for the Middle Path,and•An Illumination of Three Centrist Scriptural Systems, Called The Chariot ThatEstablishes the Definitive Meaning, which comments on N›g›rjuna’s Funda-mental Verses on Centrism, Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrism, and Milarepa’svajra song called True Expression of Centrism.58The final source is a later—and sometimes quite different—presentation ofMadhyamaka, which is found in• several chapters (mainly 6.3, 7.2, and 7.3) in Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye’sTreasury of Knowledge.Based on the groundwork of these scriptures, I try to explore the relevance ofthe Madhyamaka system for the Buddhist practitioner. Here, the emphasis doesnot lie on unraveling the details of its logic or searching for a philosophy behindit (others have already done that extensively). Rather, my focus is on the practi-cal application and efficacy of this approach when used as a spiritual tool to trainour minds in a way that is not just theoretical or intellectual but as personal as itcan get. This means that its teachings and methods are explicitly intended as away of life that permeates our whole being in order to put an end to our own andothers’ suffering.Finally, as a scriptural example for such an approach, the ninth chapter of theBodhicary›vat›rais presented in the light of a translation of Pawo TsuglaTrengwa’s commentary.As for the general approach to studying, presenting, and practicing Madhya-maka and the above materials, a few remarks about methodology seem necessaryhere. The traditional Indian and Tibetan way of explaining Buddhist texts is to22The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 22"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"combine scholarly methods with an account of the experiential relevance of thematerial as mind training for the practitioner. This represents an attempt to avoidboth mere dry scholasticism unrelated to one’s experiences in life and mere blindfaith or some sort of “emotional spirituality” that is not grounded in its properscriptural background and critical analysis. When one speaks of faith in Bud-dhism, this explicitly means well-informed trust that is born from a thorough andproper investigation of the teachers and the teachings in which this trust is to beput.Such a combined approach implies that the style and terminology of the pres-entation may vary considerably. Thus, especially for people with little or no back-ground in the Buddhist scholarly tradition, some issues may seem inaccessible atfirst. Apart from terminology, however, the main reason for this seeming inac-cessibility lies in the nature of the subjects that Madhyamaka addresses, which areoften not easily digestible. Another reason is the specific ways in which Centristsanalyze and communicate, which are usually very different from our ordinaryways of thinking and speaking. In addition, almost all Indian and Tibetan textsand their commentaries were originally written by highly learned scholars forother scholars who were all very familiar with the relevant materials and theirbackground as well as the technical terms and difficult key points. Consequently,these texts are usually terse in the extreme, come with a plethora of complicatedtechnical terms, and mainly use examples that come from Indian or Tibetan cul-ture and thus often do not ring any bells for us. Hence, both nonscholars andBuddhist practitioners who are unfamiliar with all the terms and details oftenbecome overwhelmed by such presentations and quickly lose interest in them. Tobe sure, in order to remedy that problem, I am far from advocating any over-simplification or superficial popularization that would dilute profound issues.However, I think there is a lot in Madhyamaka that can be conveyed prettystraightforwardly and shown to be practically relevant to most people withoutreliance on complicated terminology.Whenever I study and teach these materials, I regularly encounter the fact thatmere translations of Indian and Tibetan texts are usually not the best way tocommunicate their contents, judging by the reactions of many people who areexposed to such translations. Even if—or especially when—these translations areprecisely correct, they can even turn into the most counterproductive way ofcommunicating what the texts say. However, it usually helps a lot to paraphraseand elaborate on the classic texts and to furnish contemporary examples thatillustrate the salient points equally well or even better. Therefore, here too, Imainly choose this approach in presenting material from such texts. This meansthat Western scholars will not always find the precise source for each paraphraseof certain passages from the texts that I use in my presentation.59They may alsomiss all the technical details of the standard critical apparatus.60Some might evenPreface 23Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"consider this way of working with texts to be completely unscientific, since thepersonal and practical relevance of the material is addressed too.So, what to do? Going through this book will certainly require some effortfrom readers at times. However, they might want to consider that, for a longtime, Western philosophies, cultures, and societies have cultivated a split betweenintellect and experience, body and mind, and the two poles of being “objective”(or “scientific”) and “subjective” (that is, “experiential” or even “emotional”).However, this split is really only a Western invention. Like most Indian (or Asian)spiritual approaches, the Buddhist path does not regard these aspects as contra-dictory per se, nor does it favor one side over the other. Naturally, our approachto Buddhism in general—and Madhyamaka in particular—depends entirely onwhat we are looking for. Are we interested in it merely as an external object ofphilosophical, historical, or other study, or are we interested in it as an aid fortraining and transforming our minds, that is, the inner subject that studies andexperiences all this? Even in the latter case, most of us will usually just follow thenatural tendencies of our dualistic minds and vote for either a more intellectualapproach or a more experiential one, while discarding or avoiding the other.However, why not use both? Who says that we always have to live in the squarebox of an either/or world?Buddhism explicitly uses all facets of our minds. If we want to be a Buddha,which is nothing other than experiencing the full potential of our minds, we donot have to—and in fact should not—deny or neglect our personal experiences,our emotions, our intellectual sharpness, or any other part of our existence. Inprinciple, everything can be used as part of the path to mental freedom. If we tryto avoid or discard certain aspects of our minds, we just deprive ourselves of ourinnate mental richness and reduce the number of tools that we can skillfullyemploy in order to end our own and others’ suffering. In a way, the whole Madh-yamaka project is about getting our minds unstuck and letting go of precon-ceived ideas, narrow-mindedness, and thinking in terms of black and white.Training the mind in this way of leaving all constrictions behind is what enablesus to relax and widen our perspective in a fundamental manner. Specifically, inBuddhism, sharpening our intelligence through intellectual analysis and workingwith our emotional experiences at the same time are clearly regarded as mutuallysupporting and reinforcing each other. In this vein, we might consider wideningour approach toward what we may regard as the only or correct method of treat-ing the topic of Madhyamaka. Thus, our intent to reach the state of liberationfrom suffering could eventually evolve into a process of not only reading or talk-ing about the theory of Madhyamaka, but having it come alive as our personalexercise in such mind training.24The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 24"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"TIntroductionAmong Buddhists,when the issue of study and reasoning in Buddhism comesup, one often does not have to probe very deeply to encounter resistance to studyin general and reasoning or logic in particular. This approach is apparent in state-ments such as: “Study and logic is only for intellectual people.” “It has nothingto do with me as a person.” “It only creates more thoughts.” “I had enough of thatin school.” “I just want to meditate and make my own experiences.” “I’d rathertake the path of devotion.” “Who cares about the views of different people andschools in India two thousand years ago?” But is it fair to portray Madhyamakaas being only of historical, intellectual relevance or as merely an abstract philos-ophy that has nothing to do with the personal experience of modern people?What could there be in Buddhist conceptual analysis—and especially in theMadhyamaka approach to it—that is relevant and worthwhile for Buddhist prac-titioners even today?In 1973, the great Western Buddhologist Edward Conze addressed the issuewhether Buddhist texts in general and the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras (the source ofMadhyamaka) in particular are still “up-to-date” for a “modern Western audi-ence,” weaving in some remarks that will continue to guarantee him a top rankin the category of “not being politically correct” also today:Finally one could also treat them as spiritualdocuments which are stillcapable of releasing spiritual insights among people separated fromtheir original authors by two thousand years and vast disparities inintellectual and material culture. There is, however, a certain absurd-ity about interpreting spiritual matters in the abstract and in generalterms, since everything depends on concrete conditions and the actualpersons and their circumstances. Some will regard this literature asrather strange and alien, and may long for something more homespun.They will, I hope, allow me to retort with a remark that so endearedme to my students at Berkeley. Asked what Buddhism should do tobecome more acceptable to Americans, I used to enumerate with asmile a few concessions one might perhaps make respectively to theCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"feminist, democratic, hedonistic, primitivistic and anti-intellectual ten-dencies of American society. Though in the end I invariably recoveredmy nerve and reminded my listeners that it is not so much a matter ofthe Dharma adjusting itself to become adaptable to Americans, but ofAmericans changing and transforming themselves sufficiently tobecome acceptable to the Lord Buddha.61In brief, the sole aim of all Buddhist teachings is to help us realize the true natureof our minds. Thus, apart from certain outer cultural forms, there is no point intrying to alter the essential core of the means to remedy our mental afflictions inorder to make it more palatable to the various fashionable whims triggered bythese very afflictions. Rather, the main point of Buddhist studies is always toconnect with the teachings personally by applying them to the individual expe-riences in our own mind. In Buddhism, we do not study in order to follow a cur-riculum or pursue a career but because we intend to learn how to tame our minds,see things as they are, and gain freedom from suffering. Moreover, when weengage in studying Buddhism, what is processed is our very mind. Since thematerials are tailored to address the mind, plenty of emotional and intellectualreactions are sure to be triggered by this process of the mind working with its con-tents and being worked on by them. All of these reactions can and should beacknowledged, watched, and processed as they appear. This is nothing other thanpractice—mindfully dealing with our experiences.Most people seem to believe that studying means creating more thoughts.However, this is just like the initial experience of having more thoughts when westart to practice the meditation of calm abiding. That this seems to be the case isonly because we never took the time to really look at our thoughts before and thusremained unaware of their sheer number and rapid flow. Looking at them justshows us the perpetual rush hour in our minds, so it is only a matter of whetherwe notice this constant stream or are busily carried away by it. Thus, when westudy Buddhism—and especially when we use analysis through reasoning—ourthoughts about reality that are initially very massive and solid are chopped into“smaller” and “lighter” concepts. We observe that these concepts are more numer-ous, but actually the overall quantity of “thought mass” stays the same. Theadvantage of gradually processing our rigid and clumsy ideas by first noticingand then deconstructing them is that it is much easier to deal with our conceptsonce they become more flexible and subtle. In this way, we gradually approacha nonconceptual direct realization of the nature of our mind in which all conceptsare absent.This process can be compared to melting a big block of ice. If we take a largechunk out of the freezer and just let it sit there, it takes much longer for it to meltinto water than if we chop it into small pieces, since each one of these pieces will26The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 26"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"melt much more quickly. In the same way, when our hard, solid concepts incyclic existence—which are often as painful and unyielding as some jaggedchunks of ice—get broken down into their underlying assumptions, they candissolve more easily into the gentle and soothing waters of nirv› ̊a. Moreover, ifwe try to deal with our massive and largely unconscious thought patterns merelyby striving to attain some peaceful or blissful state through calming the mind inmeditation, this will have no lasting effect on the deeply rooted habitual belief sys-tems that govern our actions in the world. The lord of yogis, Milarepa, sang inone of his vajra songs:Don’t be attached to the pool of calm abiding,But let the foliage of superior insight burst into open bloom.The Buddha always emphasized a three-step approach to practicing his teach-ings: listening (studying), reflecting, and meditating. He did not say, “Listen andthen meditate.” However, it is exactly the middle stage of reflection that is oftenmissing in the practice of Buddhists. As students of Buddhism, we are requiredto first gain sufficient access to the relevant information about Buddhist theoryand practice through both scriptures and oral instructions. Following that, thematerial has to be investigated and integrated into our own personal under-standing. Finally, meditation serves as the means to familiarize ourselves withthis understanding on increasingly deeper levels until it becomes a spontaneousliving experience in every situation.Thus, it is at the step of reflection that reasoning in general—and Madhya-maka reasoning in particular—comes into play. Here, reflection does not meanjust pondering something in a vague way but employing systematic and rigoroustechniques of reasoning to gain thorough and incontrovertible certainty about thekey issues of the Buddhist path. The Buddha himself said that his teachingsshould not be accepted out of unquestioning belief or because people of highrank propagate them. Rather, the teachings should be scrutinized carefully, inmuch the same way gold is analyzed for its purity. This means that, in Bud-dhism, true and reliable confidence can arise only through a well-founded per-sonal understanding of the proper reasons that something works and istrustworthy. Otherwise, it is just some kind of assumption or blind faith thatcan easily be lost when doubts appear.Looking at the widespread dislike of reasoning and logic on the one hand andour everyday approach to the world on the other hand, we will probably be sur-prised when we have to acknowledge that we actually make daily use of reason-ing and logic even though we may not always be aware of it. As Dharmakırtibegins his Drop of Reasoning:Introduction 27Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 27"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Since correct knowledge precedes the accomplishment of all purposesof persons, it is taught [here]. Correct knowledge is twofold: percep-tion and inference.All our sciences and much of our professional and private lives are based notonly on direct observation but also on reasoning. Consciously or unconsciously,we usually act in one way or another because we know the connection betweencertain actions and the results we want to achieve or to avoid. We are not just act-ing randomly. Farmers plant seeds and cultivate them in a specific way in orderto have a good harvest. Architects build skyscrapers based on mathematical cal-culations. Parents tell their children not to touch the hot stove, because it hurts.Besides that, our favorite question is always “why?” and we usually are not satis-fied until the answer makes good sense. So we use and live with reasoning andlogic all the time, but when we hear these words, we wince and run.From a Buddhist point of view, our human mental world is a highly concep-tual one. Pure, immediate experience unaccompanied by conceptual processinghardly ever happens. Since we deal with the world through thoughts and conceptsmost of the time anyway, we might as well make use of them in an intelligent wayon our Buddhist path, rather than regarding our thoughts as something to get ridof and deliberately excluding our intellect from our practice. In Buddhism, beingintelligent and inquisitive is not a crime. It is also not a question of being eitherexclusively intellectual or exclusively devoted, with—we hope—lots of blissfulexperiences. There is nobody but ourselves to restrict the range of skillful meansthat we may beneficially apply as practitioners. Being skillful as well as develop-ing higher insight and wisdom are certainly two major focuses on the Buddhistpath, and both obviously require some intelligence and refined mental activity.If incontrovertible certainty about the foundations of the Buddhist path andits fruition has not been achieved, it may be problematic to engage in meditation.Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye says in his Treasury of Knowledgethat trying tomeditate without study and reflection is like trying to climb a mountain withouthands and feet. The Tibetan word gomba(sgom pa), usually translated as “med-itation,” means “to cultivate, train or familiarize.” If there is no clarity or certaintyabout what to familiarize with even on a conceptual level, what are we going tocultivate or familiarize ourselves with? In fact, our meditation/familiarization willlack a clear and proper object. Without such an object, it is more than likely thatdoubts will arise during such “meditation” and afterward. If we carry aroundunresolved questions about Buddhist practice and theory, wondering what we areactually doing, we have only two real options: either go back and try to resolveour doubts by gaining certainty through convinced insight or eventually drop thewhole enterprise. Once our initial enthusiasm has faded, it becomes increasinglydifficult to sustain the motivation for continuous practice without being basically28The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 28"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"convinced about what we are doing, especially when encountering unfavorablecircumstances. That this is not merely a theoretical scenario is, unfortunately,amply illustrated by a number of even longtime Buddhist practitioners whofinally give up their practice due to such doubts (which is not to say, of course,that this is the only reason for that to happen).The practical approach to gaining incontrovertible conceptual certainty iscalled analytical meditation or superior insight. Starting with the most basic Bud-dhist notions, such as the four reminders that turn the mind away from cyclicexistence, this kind of meditation may be applied throughout the whole path. Forexample, when we reflect on the precious and rare opportunity of human exis-tence or on impermanence, there is no point in trying to convince ourselves ofthese things by just repeating “My life is precious” or “Everything is imperma-nent” like a mantra. Rather, it is important to come up with some good reasonsthat this is the case. This process is, of course, supported by more systematicscriptural material, but there is a definite sense that we must apply personal inves-tigation and mentally process these statements from various angles by connect-ing them to our own experience.This is even more important with such key Buddhist notions as the lack of a per-sonal self and the lack of any real identity of phenomena. Tackling these topics inorder to make them personally relevant to our lives cannot be accomplished with-out some degree of personal investigation by honestly looking into our own viewsof the world and being willing to question them. Some of the most radical andchallenging ways to do this are no doubt contained in the Madhyamaka teachings.What Is Madhyamaka?A typical Madhyamaka answer to the question “What is Madhyamaka?” wouldstate what it is not: It is not a philosophy, not a religion, not a doctrine, not a his-torical school of thought, not a belief system, not a linguistic theory or analysis,not a psychotherapy, not agnosticism, not nihilism, not existentialism, nor is itan intellectual mind game of some people in India and Tibet who had too muchspare time and just wanted to tease others.So, what is it then? When we use the word Madhyamaka, we first have to beclear about whether we are referring to a view, a meditation system, a spiritualpath, its fruition, or the ultimate nature of all phenomena, including our mind.The most fundamental meaning of Madhyamaka is this last one. This ultimatenature is the fundamental ground within which Madhyamaka view, meditation,and conduct evolve. The essential characteristic of such view, meditation, andconduct is that they are all aimed at nothing but realizing this nature. Madhya-maka fruition is then the direct and incontrovertible experience of this ultimatereality within our own mind.Introduction 29Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 29"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Now, what can we say about this fundamental Madhyamaka? Basically, thereare two kinds of answers that are pointedly illustrated in Pawo Rinpoche’s com-mentary on The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life:[Some] consider merely not giving an answer as the ultimate actuality.This is certainly a case of giving those who understand the meaning ofCentrism a good chance for a laugh. . . . Therefore, it is explained thatwhen MañjuŸrı asked Vimalakırti about the meaning of the actual, thegenuine answer [in this case] was to not give an answer.62However,when one naïve being does not give an answer to the question ofanother one, how could these two cases ever be comparable? Youshould know the difference between a bodhisattva in his last existencewho dwells under the bodhi tree and [someone like] Devadatta sittingunder a nimba tree. If you think, “These are comparable,” then askabout genuine [reality] in front of an ox and you will get the finalanswer that you wish for.63Thus, ultimately, from the point of view of the true nature of phenomena itselfand for such highly realized beings as MañjuŸrı and Vimalakırti who directlyexperience it in meditative equipoise, there is nothing that could be said aboutit, since its very essence is that all discursiveness and its reference points64have dis-solved.

Thus, whatever might be said aboutMadhyamaka and whatever aspects of it we practically apply must be understoodas being merely like a pointing finger that makes us look in a certain direction (orrather no direction). However, this finger should not be mistaken for what itpoints to. As it is said, “Do not mistake the finger pointing to the moon for themoon itself.” Thus, it is on the basis of their minds directly realizing ultimate real-ity—the moon of the actual Madhyamaka—and for the sake of others realizingthis too that Centrist masters set out to point with their scriptural, verbal, andphysical fingers to this orb free from center or edge.On the conventional level, in the great vehicle of Buddhism, Madhyamaka asa “school” is regarded as the second major system beside the Yog›c›ra (YogaPractice)67school. Madhyamaka is not just something that was made up by Cen-trist masters such as N›g›rjuna. Rather, it has a firm basis in the teachings of Bud-dha ⁄›kyamuni. This refers not only to the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasbut also tomany other sÒtras from the first and third turnings of the wheel of dharma.68During the second century ce, N›g›rjuna formulated these teachings in a sys-tematic fashion that embedded their basic message of emptiness in a rigoroussystem of reasoning.69However, N›g›rjuna never referred to himself as a“M›dhyamika,” nor did he consider himself the founder of a new school or a sys-tem called “Madhyamaka.” He just used the term “discussion of emptiness.”70Infact, his approach is a system to get rid of all systems, including itself. N›g›rjuna’sbasic concern was to free the teachings of the Buddha from all superimpositionsand denials, his main target being the scholastic systems of Abhidharma withinBuddhism. It was only later when Bh›vaviveka71started to talk about Madhya-maka as a distinct view that N›g›rjuna began to be regarded as the founder of this“new” school, whose followers were also called “Proponents of the Lack ofNature.” Over the following centuries, there were many debates in India andTibet about the correct understanding of N›g›rjuna’s presentation, which led todifferent streams within the Madhyamaka school. In this book, its system isexplained as it was understood by the “early Centrists”72in Tibet. In general, thisrefers to the ways in which Centrism was presented in Tibet before Tsongkhapa,which are based on the Indian treatises on Centrism and the oral teachings of thenumerous Indian masters with whom Tibetans had direct contact during thistime.73More specifically, the Eighth Karmapa Mikyö Dorje identifies the lineagesthat come from AtıŸa (982–1054) and Patsab Lots›wa74(born 1055) as “the earlyTibetan tradition of Consequentialism.” This tradition of teaching Centrismcontinues to the present day in most parts of the Kagyü, Nyingma, and Sakyaschools of Tibetan Buddhism.Introduction 31Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 31"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"An Extreme MiddleTo find out what the whole project of Madhyamaka is about, it is helpful to lookfirst at the Sanskrit word itself. In the West, Madhyamakais usually translated as“middle way,” but the word “way” does not have any correlate in either the San-skrit term nor its Tibetan equivalent uma.75Madhyameans “middle or center,”mais an emphasizing affix, and ka76refers to anything that deals with or expressesthis middle, be it texts, philosophical systems, or persons. (The latter are mostlycalled “M›dhyamika,” however.) Thus, Madhyamaka means “that which dealswith (or proclaims) the very middle/center.” The corresponding Tibetan termumausually also refers to “the very middle.” Some masters, such as the EighthKarmapa Mikyö Dorje, interpret the syllable maas a negative and thus take thewhole term to mean that there is not (ma) even a middle (u) between theextremes. This interpretation may not strictly conform with Tibetan grammar,but its meaning surely has a basis in the scriptures. The SÒtra of the King of Med-itative Concentrationdeclares:Both existence and nonexistence are extremes.Purity and impurity are extremes too.Therefore, having left behind both extremes,The wise do not abide even in a middle.77The SÒtra Requested by Crown Jewelstates:The perfection of knowledge78is free from extremes and also does notabide in a middle.79The K›Ÿyapa Chapter SÒtrasays:This so-called cyclic existence is an extreme. This “nirv› ̊a” is a secondextreme. What is the middle between these two extremes is not to beanalyzed, not to be shown, without appearance, without cognition:K›Ÿyapa, this is called “the middle way, the perfect discrimination ofphenomena.”The center is without form, unseen, nonabiding, nonappearing, andwithout a location.80Here, this center is furthermore explained as being equivalent to ultimate realityand suchness.32The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 32"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"N›g›rjuna states in his Fundamental Verses on Centrism:Where there is neither beginning nor end,Where should there be a middle?81In his Song of Looking at the Expanse of Dharmas, AtıŸa says:If the middle is completely released from extremes,Since there are no extremes, there is also no middle.The view that is without middle and extremesIs the perfect view.82The Treasury of Knowledgequotes the Sixth Shamarpa Chökyi Wangchug’s Col-lected Reasonings:Under analysis, neither middle nor end is found,And one does not dwell even in a middle.All claims will dissolve.There is neither beginning nor end, and a center is not observed.There are no positions and no philosophical systems.At this point, this is the great center.83In his commentary, Pawo Rinpoche agrees:When clinging has been purified, finally, even a mere middle cannotbe observed. All views have completely vanished.84One might wonder, “Is there actually a middle between these twoextremes?” If there are no extremes, where should there be a middle?. . . When all kinds of grasping that superimpose or deny existence,nonexistence, a middle, and so on have subsided, . . . this is called“seeing or realizing identitylessness.”85Thus, the actual Madhyamaka per se does not refer to a middle way betweentwo extreme views (such as thesis and antithesis) in the sense of trying to find asynthesis or keeping some sort of balance between such extremes as existence andnonexistence or permanence and annihilation.86It is also not some definable oridentifiable middle in relation or opposition to any extremes, since—in the Cen-trist view—such a middle would only serve as another reference point and thusas a further extreme.

In fact, “extreme” is just another word for reference point. It isimportant not to misunderstand the freedom from all reference points as justanother reference point or theory, a more sophisticated philosophical point ofview, or some mere utter blankness. Rather, the actual Madhyamaka stands forthe unobstructed, supple, and relaxed openness of a mind in which all impulsesof grasping at something have completely dissolved. As N›g›rjuna’sSixty Stan-zas on Reasoningsays:By taking any standpoint whatsoever,You will be snatched by the cunning snakes of the afflictions.Those whose minds have no standpointWill not be caught.If there were a standpoint,There would be desire and freedom from desire.However, great beings without a standpointDo not have desire, nor are they free from desire.Those whose minds are not moved,Not even by a flicker of a thought about “complete voidness,”Have crossed the horrifying ocean of existenceThat is agitated by the snakes of the afflictions.88Madhyamaka Travels: The Complicated Road to SimplicityWhen talking about Madhyamaka as the practical path or soteriological approachto this ultimate freedom from all reference points, what is most important is theunderlying motivation and purpose of teaching and traveling this path. Espe-cially at points when our minds get weary of all the reasonings, when nothingseems to make sense, and when we wonder why we got into this in the first place,it is helpful to remember this. If we just look at the complex techniques of decon-structive analysis and reasoning in which Centrists engage, it is easy to lose trackof what this rigorous dismantling of everything is good for. Essentially, just as in34The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 34"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"the case of all other teachings of the Buddha, the only thing that Centrists aregenuinely concerned about is to help sentient beings to overcome suffering andits causes and to reach the irreversible liberation of Buddhahood (which is noth-ing other than the ultimate Madhyamaka described earlier). Thus, what lies at theheart of the Madhyamaka approach is not a mere view but a bodhisattva’s moti-vation to free all beings from suffering.In the Centrist approach, the root cause of suffering is identified as the cling-ing that takes oneself and other phenomena to be real in just the way they appear.Different from that, the luminous space of our mind’s true nature is essentiallyfree from all discursiveness and reference points. In itself, this space is basic aware-ness which unfolds as an unceasing natural display of its own. Through its vivid-ness, we may momentarily become unaware of its actual nature and get caughtup in its mere appearance. Being lost in the flux of mind’s display without anawareness of its spacious nature leads to a fundamental fear of just allowing itsfree flow. There is some urge to feel grounded and safe within the stream of thisinfinite expanse, so we try to hold on to something within it or freeze it alto-gether. Imagine sitting on a sunny beach and looking at the ocean’s large rollingwaves, feeling relaxed and serene just from watching the play of this moving vast-ness. However, if you were to fall into this ocean and get washed away by itshuge waves, your state of mind would be far from spacious and relaxed. Mostprobably, you would not think that the waves are just a superficial movement onthe surface of the deep, still waters of the ocean and that their nature is nothingbut freely flowing water. Rather, you would be helplessly carried away by thepower of these waves. You would panic and desperately try to find something tohold on to, which would only bring you closer to drowning. This is the situationof sentient beings in sa ̇s›ra.In the ocean of mind, there is no fixed point to stand on, so all we do as mis-taken beings is hold on to our initial impulse of trying to grasp at such a fixedpoint. This impulse of grasping itself becomes our first reference point, called“me.” It is, in a sense, a very basic self-justification for our existence. To adaptthe famous words of Descartes, we seem to say, “I grasp, therefore I am.” Thisfirst, central reference point of “me” naturally leads to its counterpart of “other”and all further ones, such as subject, object, inside, outside, good, bad, and so on.Gradually, these reference points become more and more solidified through addi-tional layers of conceptual paint and glue. Finally, we have managed to convinceourselves of the hard-and-fast reality of our magnificent work of art—this self-spun sophisticated cocoon that ensnares us—to such a degree that we feel it is themost natural thing in the world and hold on to it for dear life. We have com-pletely lost track of where we started and of the fact that this construction isentirely homemade. Within this castle in the sky, we feel attraction to those ofits very real-looking parts that affirm ourselves, while giving rise to aversionIntroduction 35Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 35"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"toward its other parts. This emotional polarity calls for action: trying to obtainor keep what we feel attracted to and to avoid or get rid of what we feel aversionto. As the karmic fruits of such actions, we then experience the various types ofhappiness and suffering in cyclic existence. During this continuous process, everysingle aspect of it just adds up to and solidifies our cocoon even more. Thus, inthe double sense of the word, we keep spinning in what is called cyclic existence.Since, according to Centrists, the main cause of suffering is our basic clingingto reference points, it is this cause that we have to dissolve in order to obtainfreedom from its result: suffering. Thus, whatever is taught in Centrism is basedon precisely this motive and constantly points to what might happen once ourcocoon unravels. For Centrists, apart from just being tools to the end of liberat-ing sentient beings from their pains, there is no intrinsic value or purpose in phi-losophy, reasoning, refuting other people’s positions, or even meditationaltogether. Candrakırti says in his Entrance into Centrism:The analyses in [N›g›rjuna’s] treatise were not performed out ofattachment to debate.[Rather,] true reality has been taught for the sake of complete release.It may well be that in the process of explaining true realityThe scriptures of others become ruined, but there lies no fault in this.89In the end, Madhyamaka refers to the actual direct experience of a nonrefer-ential state of mind that is utterly free from all discursiveness obscuring the see-ing of mind’s true nature. So when Centrists talk about freedom fromdiscursiveness, it means not only freedom from extreme or wrong ideas but com-plete absence of any coarse, subtle, conscious, or unconscious ideas, thoughts, ormental images whatsoever (obviously, this does not mean some kind of coma).At the most subtle level, this means to be free from even the most deeplyingrained tendencies within the mental flux of ordinary sentient beings, such asour instinctive “gut feeling” of being individuals who are different from othersand the appearance of subject and object as being distinct. Of course, we cannotaffect such deep levels of mind with mere conceptual reasoning, but Centristsregard the path to mental freedom as a gradual process of stripping off the manylayers of our cocoon of obscurations. Conceptual analysis is used as the initialremedy, but it is only a technique that points beyond both obscurations andtheir remedies (including this very analysis), that is, beyond the entire realm ofreference points altogether, no matter whether we call them bondage and cyclicexistence or liberation and nirv› ̊a.Reasoned analysis is refined more and more through the threefold approach ofstudying, reflecting, and meditating. In other words, coarse concepts are coun-teracted with more subtle concepts, which are in turn dissolved by even more36The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 36"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"refined ones. Meditation basically means becoming familiar with such insightsand thus letting them sink in to the deeper levels of the mind that will becomemore and more accessible and prominent as we proceed along the path. Finally,we will be able to let go of even the most subtle referential threads of the cocoon.Thus, reasoned analysis does not end up in some blank nothingness but eventu-ally gives way to relaxing the mind on a profound level and just resting with crispwakefulness in its natural, uncontrived state beyond words, concepts, and refer-ence points. It is in this way that Madhyamais utter freedom from discursivenessand Madhyamakais the view or teaching that points to this freedom. AsN›g›rjuna begins his Praise to the Vajra of Mind:I prostrate to my own mindThat eliminates mind’s ignoranceBy dispelling the web of mental eventsThrough this very mind.Sharpening the Mind, Opening the HeartSo far, we have seen what is dissolved on the Madhyamaka path and what isfinally attained. What is the driving force that allows us to actually work with ourdelusion? What is the main mental factor that brings about freedom? It is calledprajñ›p›ramit›, the perfection of knowledge. As their name suggests, thePrajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras—on which the Madhyamaka system is based—deal exten-sively with such knowledge.90Conventionally speaking, this involves two aspects:emptiness as the object to be realized by prajñ›p›ramit› and the wisdom ofprajñ›p›ramit› as the subject that realizes emptiness. Ultimately, there is no dif-ference between these two aspects of subject and object. However, in terms of cul-tivating the realization of this unity of the ultimate subject and object on thepath, the sÒtras do not address only the object, or emptiness. In a more hiddenway, they also lay out the gradual subjective process of realizing emptiness, thatis, how knowledge is perfected in the mind. This means a detailed description ofwhat happens in the minds of bodhisattvas when they progress through the var-ious levels of realizing emptiness that finally culminate in perfect Buddhahood.91Thus, the texts always refer to “the perfection of knowledge (or wisdom)”; theynever say “the perfection of emptiness” or “the perfection of the nature of phe-nomena.” Of course, by definition, there is nothing to be perfected in emptinessor the true nature of the mind anyway. However, there surely is a lot to be per-fected in our awareness of this nature. So the perfection of knowledge meansperfecting not the ultimate object to be realized but the realization of this object.During what is experienced as the mental paths and bhÒmis of refining anduncovering the perfection of knowledge, this perfection itself is something thatIntroduction 37Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 37"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"is completely beyond all reification,92inconceivable, and inexpressible. However,as mentioned before, other than just becoming mute about it, it is still possibleto compassionately and skillfully point to just that which is beyond everythingone could say or think about it. In The SÒtra of Vast Display, right after havingbecome the Awakened One, Buddha ⁄›kyamuni is reported to have uttered thefollowing verse:I have found a nectarlike dharma,Profound, peaceful, free from discursiveness, luminous, andunconditioned.Whoever I would teach it to could not understand it.Thus, I shall just stay silent in the middle of the forest.93How can we understand that the Buddha first expressed the utter futility of teach-ing others what he had realized and then engaged in doing precisely this for forty-five years, until the end of his life? Essentially, enlightenment is inexpressible andinconceivable, but it is not inaccessible. Possessing this insight as well as the infi-nite compassion and capacity to actually show others how to reach mental free-dom, the Buddha taught what cannot be taught.Again, it should be kept in mind that verbal or other indications are nothingbut a pointing finger and not that to which this finger points. We cannot expe-rience the taste of delicious food simply by talking or hearing about it. Still, wemight become inspired to engage in preparing such food and then relish it. In thesame way, we might become inspired to make some effort to experience the tasteof enlightenment while not mistaking the words for their referents. Otherwise,if there is nothing to be said anyway, what would be the point of twenty-one hugevolumes of Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasin the Buddhist canon, all the detailed Madh-yamaka scriptures, or the teachings of the Buddha in general?Usually, Centrists—and particularly Consequentialists—are known for theirrefusal to make any statements about what happens when all obscurations havefinally dissolved. The reason for this is that they try to avoid fueling our ever-activeimpulse to get hooked on anything that is presented to us as just another referencepoint. In particular, as we journey on the Buddhist path and thus refine our under-standing, our reference points seem to become ever more sophisticated, up to themost sophisticated reference point of thinking that we are without reference point.Hence, the Centrist approach is adamant in taking away our good old mental toyswhile strictly refusing to provide new toys, not even very nice ones such as “Bud-dhahood,” “enlightenment,” “Dharmak›ya,” or “freedom from discursiveness.”This is why Centrist texts so often deny that Buddhahood, wisdom, and thethree enlightened bodies exist and that a Buddha possesses wisdom. However,these are not categorical statements that wisdom and so on absolutely do not38The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 38"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"exist in any way and under all circumstances. Rather, such explanations shouldbe understood in the same noncommital way that all Centrist negations areemployed. For example, from the refutation of arising it does not necessarily fol-low that one asserts nonarising or anything else instead. Also, when Centristsdeny that a sprout arises, they do so in order to stop our clinging to the notionthat such arising is really existent. It does not mean that they try to refute or stopthe activity of farming as such.Likewise, the Centrist denial that wisdom and Buddhahood exist has a num-ber of purposes. It serves as a means to put an end to the fixation that wisdomand Buddhahood are really established, since it is not only our getting hooked onworldly things that has to be dissolved but also the grasping at supramundanephenomena in terms of the Buddhist path and fruition. Thus, such denial is nota teaching that wisdom and Buddhahood are inert things or utter nothingnessafter everything has been annihilated. Nor is the denial of the existence of wis-dom to be taken as an affirmation that wisdom is not established, since all think-ing in terms of existence, nonexistence, and so on is nothing but being trappedin reification; that is to say, it is exactly what is to be relinquished. If even ordi-nary things cannot be seen as fitting into such categories as existent, nonexistent,and so on, how should these dualistic notions ever apply to the very means or theresult of eliminating precisely these dualistic notions? Furthermore, the teachingthat wisdom does not exist implies that subject and object are never found asseparate entities within the nature of all phenomena. Since a Buddha realizes theexpanse that is primordially without the duality of subject and object, a Buddhadoes not possess any wisdom in the sense of a realizer that engages in an objectas something to be realized. Still, the three enlightened bodies, the four or fivewisdoms, nonreferential compassion, and enlightened activity do function asdynamic processes, but they cannot be solidified or pinned down in any way. Thedetailed explanations of these factors in Centrist texts are meant as conventionaldescriptions that in themselves point to nonreferential openness-awareness.Thus, Centrist masters thoroughly prepare the ground by continually makingit clear that our tendency to grasp at everything—be it mundane or supramun-dane—is our fundamental problem and that we must be constantly aware of it.It is against this background that a number of positive statements in the scripturesclearly indicate that freedom or enlightenment is not mere extinction. The finalperfection of knowledge or wisdom manifests as a living and compassionateawareness of the nature of all phenomena in which all reference points—includ-ing those of emptiness as an object and knowledge as a subject—have vanishedaltogether. This wisdom is neither a mere negation of everything nor just empti-ness. It is the luminous and open expanse of the true nature of mind which isaware of its own fundamental state.94The Prajñ›p›ramit› SÒtra in Eight Thou-sand Linessays:Introduction 39Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 39"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"“The mind is no-mind.

It is for just this [type of seeing] that theconventional terms “penetrating the nature of phenomena” and“beholding ultimate reality” are used. The conventional term “person-ally experienced wisdom” is then used for the very knowledge that doesnot observe the characteristics of the reference points of subject andobject.109Thus, the nature of phenomena is not seen through appre-hending a subject and an object. Rather, if one knows that subject andobject are not observable, one engages in the nature of phenomena.110Because one has engaged in emptiness through devoted interest on[the paths of] accumulation and junction, emptiness—which is, likespace, without any difference—is realized on the path of seeing in amanner of being omnipresent.

Independence on the worldly seeming level, [this final realization isdescribed by] saying, “Perfect Buddhahood is attained.”111Yet Buddhahood is in no way a self-sufficient or self-indulgent state, since itswisdom-space radiates the living warmth of infinite and spontaneous compassion.Realizing the nature of one’s own mind means seeing the nature of everybody’smind. The more clearly Buddhas and bodhisattvas experience the shining of thetrue heart of all beings, the more clearly they realize the suffering of these beingsthat comes from cloudlike ignorance within the clear sky of their minds. Seeingthrough the illusory nature of both this ignorance and the ensuing unnecessarysuffering, Buddhas and bodhisattvas cannot help doing everything they can towake up and comfort their fellow beings, just as we would try to wake up peo-ple who show all the signs of having a terrible nightmare and soothe them bytelling them that it was just a dream. Furthermore, Pawo Rinpoche declares:Thus, by gaining power over and becoming very skilled in the depend-ent origination of the collections of causes for the entirety of cyclicexistence and nirv› ̊a, compassion for the assembly of sentient beingswho do not realize this in the same way wells up unbearably.

In his presentation ofthese lineages, the Karmapa does not merely show the richness of transmission.He clearly explains not only that the final purport of Madhyamaka is no differ-ent from the main Kagyü teachings of Mah›mudr› and the Six Dharmas ofN›ropa, but that Madhyamaka view and meditation are the indispensable basisthat underlies the entire range of practices in this school. The Karmapa’s inter-est in doing so is not just to establish some philosophical or theoretical consis-tency on the levels of sÒtra and tantra. His essential concern is more important:to give clear specifications as to how Madhyamaka is crucial in all practices so thatthey actually function as practical tools to definitely liberate the mind from allobscurations.113Again, the heart that brings the Madhyamaka approach to life isnot a mere view but a bodhisattva’s motivation to free all beings from suffering.In tune with this basic thrust of classic Madhyamaka, the Eighth Karmapa’s fore-most concern throughout his commentary is one of ultimate versus pedagogic,not ultimate versus conventional. He focuses on whether the view’s orientationis soteriological as opposed to philosophical. In other words, his concern is aboutwhat is useful for liberation rather than what may be an elegant theory or a philo-sophical system that is coherent from a conventional perspective. Thus, when herefutes some views of other Tibetan masters or their attacks on the Mah›mudr›system of the Kagyü school, he does so not for polemical reasons or simply tostreamline his own position and point out the philosophical inconsistencies ofothers.

In his Fundamental Verses,N›g›rjuna refers to the Kacc›yanagottasutta:114Through his knowledge of entities and nonentities,115In the instruction for K›ty›yana,The Victor has refutedBoth [their] existence and nonexistence.116The Acelak›Ÿyapasuttaspells out the typical fourfold negation of arising by say-ing that suffering is not produced from itself, nor from something other, norfrom both, nor from neither. Rather, it is said to come about through depend-ent origination, which in itself is not characterized by any of these fourextremes.117The P›li canon contains several references to the fourteen undecided ques-tions118that follow the structure of the tetralemma. The Buddha refused to agreeto any of these questions when they were put to him by the mendicant Vaccha-gotta. For example:Gotama denies that . . . the Tath›gatha passes to another existenceafter death here, . . . does not pass to another existence after deathhere, (that) he both does and does not pass to another existence afterhis death here, (and that the Tath›gata) neither passes nor does notpass to another existence after his death here.119The Buddha also explained the purely soteriological reasons for such a denial:To hold that the world is eternal, or to hold that it is not, or to agreeof any other of the propositions you adduce, Vaccha, is the thicket oftheorizing, the wilderness of theorizing, the bondage . . . the tangle andthe shackles of theorizing, attended by ill, distress, perturbation andfever; it conduces not to aversion, passionlessness, tranquillity, peace,illumination and Nirv› ̊a. This is the danger I discern in these views,which makes me scorn them all.120Both the dialectic structure and the content of these fourteen questions havetheir exact parallels in N›g›rjuna’s Fundamental Verses121and other texts.122Alsoin the Brahmaj›lasutta(Dıgha Nik›ya), the Buddha discards all theories, views,48The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 48"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"and speculations as dogmatic narrow-mindedness (di ̨ ̨hiv›da) and refuses to bedrawn into their net (j›la).123Even the crucial notion of emptiness can be found in the P›li canon. Forexample, the Buddha prophesies about future monks:The monks will no longer want to hear and study the sutt›ntas taughtby the Thus-Gone One that are so very deep in meaning, supramun-dane, and related to emptiness (suññat›-patisa ̇yutt›). Instead, theywill only listen to the mundane sutt›ntas taught by disciples and com-posed by poets, which are artistic and embellished with beautiful wordsand syllables.124finanda asked the Buddha:Lord, it is said that the world is empty (suñña), the world is empty. ButLord, in what respect is the world called empty?The Buddha answered:finanda, since it is empty of identity or anything pertaining to iden-tity, therefore it is said that the world is empty.125There is further mention of emptiness by referring to the mind when attainingnirv› ̊a upon the cessation of afflictions and ordinary consciousnesses.126In thecollection of songs of realization of Therav›din nuns, the Therıg›th›, the femalearhat Uttam› proclaims that she has attained emptiness and signlessness uponentering nibb›na.127As is well known, the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasare the teachings of the Buddhathat are most directly related to Madhyamaka. However, there are many othersÒtras that also serve as the scriptural bases of this system. These include TheJewel Mound128collection (specificallyThe K›Ÿyapa Chapter SÒtraand The SÒtraof the Meeting of Father and Son),129The SÒtra of the White Lotus of GenuineDharma,130The SÒtra of the King of Meditative Concentration, The SÒtra of theArrival in Laºka,131andThe SÒtra That Unravels the Intention.132Thus, Madh-yamaka as a later system is definitely based on all levels of the sÒtras of the Bud-dha. It can well be considered as a logical and systematized continuation of manyof the most crucial elements in his teachings.The generally accepted beginning of Madhyamaka as a formalized system isattributed to N›g›rjuna in the second century. According to the Eighth KarmapaMikyö Dorje, N›g›rjuna, his main disciple firyadeva, AŸvagho ̋a133(both sec-ond/third century), and ⁄›ntideva (eighth century) are called “the Centrists of theThe Transmission of Madhyamaka from India to Tibet 49Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 49"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"model texts,”134since no other Centrists ever denied that they were Centrists ordisputed their texts. The debate that led to the later Tibetan division of Centristsinto Autonomists and Consequentialists135started in the sixth century withBh›vaviveka, who criticized the way in which Buddhap›lita, who lived early inthat century, had commented on N›g›rjuna’s Fundamental Verses on Centrism.Candrakırti (sixth/seventh century) extensively defended Buddhap›lita’s presen-tation and rebutted Bh›vaviveka’s critique of the latter. Thus, he is regarded asthe actual founder of the Consequentialist system, since he presented it in sucha thorough way. Many later Centrists, such as Jñ›nagarbha (seventh century),⁄›ntarak ̋ita (eighth century), KamalaŸıla (740–795), Haribhadra (eighth cen-tury), and Prajñ›karamati (tenth century), exhibited some positions that varyslightly from Candrakırti’s approach. AtıŸa (982–1054) seems to have mostly—butnot exclusively—followed Candrakırti’s approach. However, in India through-out this time, there was no notion of distinct subschools among Centrists, and,with maybe a single late exception, even the names Autonomists and Conse-quentialists were not used in Indian texts.136In particular, there is no evidence thatthe Consequentialist approach was generally considered any better than theAutonomist one. Rather, the texts of those Centrists who later came to be labeledAutonomists enjoyed great and widespread esteem. In fact, all these masters dif-fered only in the methodology through which the correct view of the ultimate inone’s mind is best communicated to and generated in others. They do not showthe slightest difference in their position on ultimate reality, since all of them arefully qualified Centrists. Otherwise, if they differed with regard to the ultimate,it would follow that either the Autonomist or the Consequentialist view is notCentrism, since there are no multiple true natures of phenomena.The Eighth Karmapa says that, in Tibet, some people mistakenly claim thatcertain Centrists, such as Candrakırti, do have a higher view and realization anda better philosophical system than certain others, such as Bh›vaviveka. However,if this were the case, the latter would not be Centrists at all, since for someonewho has not fully realized the actual meaning of Centrism, the expressions “Cen-trism” and “Centrist” remain nothing but mere names. Furthermore, since theBuddha taught in accordance with individual disciples’ various mental abilities,there surely appear distinctions in terms of the expedient and definitive meaningswithin the other three philosophical systems in Buddhism. However, in the con-text of Centrism as its fourth and highest philosophical system,137the Buddhataught only the final definitive meaning. Since there is no distinction betweenexpedient and definitive meaning in the Centrist teachings themselves, how couldany Centrists have higher or lower views?During the first four hundred years of Buddhism in Tibet, Centrism was trans-mitted mainly from an Autonomist perspective. This is primarily because many50The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 50"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"of the leading Indian masters during the early spread of Buddhism to Tibet, suchas ⁄›ntarak ̋ita and KamalaŸıla, followed this approach.138Thus, the majority ofMadhyamaka texts to be translated into Tibetan during the first period of trans-lation were either by N›g›rjuna or by Autonomists.139As mentioned earlier, to acertain extent AtıŸa’s transmission was an exception here. However, certainly upthrough his time, there was no clear differentiation of distinct Madhyamaka“schools” headed by Bh›vaviveka and Candrakırti, and their approaches wereevidently studied side by side. As for early Tibetan masters after AtıŸa, NgogLots›wa Loden Sherab140(1059–1109) is said to have followed the Autonomistapproach. It is also known that Chaba Chökyi Senge (1109–1169) strictly adheredto Autonomist reasonings and completely denied the use of consequences.141Heis moreover said to have defeated the Kashmiri Consequentialist Jay›nanda indebate. AtıŸa’s disciples Dromtönpa Gyalway Jungnay142(1005–1064) and NagtsoLots›wa Tsultrim Gyalwa143(born 1011), as well as several Kadampa masters suchas Potowa144(1031?–1105), are said to have been early Tibetan Consequentialists.However, a systematic translation and propagation of the major Consequential-ist scriptures, especially those of Candrakırti, started only with Patsab Lots›waNyima Tra (born 1055). After that, it still took a few more centuries before allTibetan schools more or less unanimously regarded the Consequentialist systemas the supreme Centrist approach, a position held to this day.I. The Two Lineages of the Indigenous and UniqueTransmissions of the Kagyü Tradition145a. The Lineage from N›ropa146This transmission starts, of course, with the Buddha and continues with Aval-okiteŸvara, MañjuŸrı, and Vajrap› ̊i. From N›g›rjuna it was passed on tofiryadeva, Candrakırti,147M›taºgı, Tilopa (988–1069), N›ropa (1016–1100),Marpa (1012–1097), Milarepa (1040–1123), Gampopa (1079–1153), the FirstKarmapa Tüsum Khyenba (1110–1193), Drogön Rechen148(1088–1158), Bom-tragba,149the Second Karmapa Karma Pakshi (1206–1283), Orgyenba(1230–1309), the Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje (1284–1339), GyalwaYungdönba150(1284–1365), the Fourth Karmapa Rölpay Dorje (1340–1383), theSecond Shamarpa Kachö Wangbo151(1350–1405), the Fifth Karmapa TeshinShegba152(1384–1415), Ratnabhadra, the Sixth Karmapa Tongwa Tönden(1416–1453), Jampel Sangbo153and the First Gyaltsab Paljor Töndrub154(1427–1489), the Seventh Karmapa Chötra Gyamtso, Nyemo Goshri GönchoÖser155and Jetsün Reba Chenbo (1505-1569)156up through the Eighth KarmapaMikyö Dorje. After him, this transmission continues in the commonly knownway within the Kagyü tradition.157The Transmission of Madhyamaka from India to Tibet 51Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 51"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"b. The Lineage from MaitrıpaMaitrıpa (1012–1097) realized that the Madhyamaka taught by Saraha the Elder,Saraha the Younger (⁄avaripa), N›g›rjuna, and Candrakırti has the same mean-ing and taught it in this way to others. From Maitrıpa, this lineage was passed onto Marpa, Milarepa, and Gampopa. After Gampopa, it continues in the same wayas the lineage from N›ropa above.Maitrıpa’s cycle of Centrist teachings is known as “the twenty-five dharmaworks of mental nonengagement.”158His Ten Verses on True Realitysays:Those who wish to know true reality[See] that it is neither with aspect nor without aspect.Not adorned with the guru’s instructions,The middle is only middling.159Maitrıpa’s student, the late Indian Centrist Sahajavajra (eleventh/twelfth cen-tury), says in his commentary160that “with aspect” and “without aspect” in thisverse refer to the views of all Aspectarians and Non-Aspectarians,161who do notrealize true reality. The definitive meaning of true reality is the lack of nature. Itaccords with the explanations on dependent origination by Centrist masters suchas N›g›rjuna, firyadeva, and Candrakırti. “The guru” is Bhagavatı—the perfec-tion of knowledge—as well as these Centrist masters. “The middle” is the natureof true reality which accords with their explanations: It is the unity of arisingand nonarising, of dependent origination and emptiness. Any kind of “middle”that is understood as some remainder after having negated certain specifics is notcorrect; it is “only middling.” Thus, Maitrıpa’s explanation of Centrism fullyaccords with the above masters.162In Tibet, three distinct ways of fulfilling the intended meaning of this“Madhyamaka of mental nonengagement” have developed:1. the practice that focuses on the profound and luminous Madhyamaka of theMantra vehicle2. the practice that focuses on the profound Madhyamaka of the SÒtras3. the practice that focuses on “the Madhyamaka of False Aspectarian Mere Men-talism”163Marpa and Milarepa transmitted and accomplished the entirety of the first twopractices. Gampopa specifically focused on the second practice and widely prop-agated it. He was praised by the Buddha in The SÒtra of the King of MeditativeConcentrationas the one who would later spread the teachings of this sÒtra—theMadhyamaka. These specific sÒtra-based instructions of Gampopa were given the52The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 52"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"name of Mah›mudr›, a term that primarily comes from the tantras. The greattranslator and scholar Gö Lots›wa Shönu Pal164(1392–1481) says in his Blue Annals:Tagbo Rinpoche produced an understanding of Mah›mudr› in thosebeginners who had not obtained initiation. This is the system of thePrajñ›p›ramit›.165Here the Eighth Karmapa Mikyö Dorje says that when the Madhyamaka viewof this system dawns in one’s mind stream, this is called “the manifestation ofordinary mind”166or “the manifestation of the Dharma Body.”167When one real-izes that the bearers of the nature of phenomena, such as sprouts and thoughts,are not established as anything other than this nature of phenomena, one refersto this realization using the conventional expression of “thoughts appearing as theDharma Body.” The view and meditation of this Mah›mudr› system as inseparable from Cen-trism are said to be very necessary in order to eliminate remaining latencies of dis-cursiveness and the impregnations of negativity168at the time when extremelypleasant experiences of the Vajray›na’s wisdom of the unity of bliss and empti-ness arise in one’s mind. Even a partial dawning of the view and meditation ofthis Mah›mudr› in the mind serves as the supreme panacea for the referentialgrasping at what is held to be inferior (such as seeming reality and adventitiousstains) or superior (such as ultimate reality or the nature of phenomena). With-out such a remedy, just like medicine turning into poison, the view and medita-tion of the freedom from discursiveness would turn into a view and meditationthat are themselves nothing but discursiveness.That this specific sÒtra-based Mah›mudr› system is not just an invention ofthe Kagyüpas in Tibet is demonstrated by the following passages from Indiantreatises. In his Entrance into True Reality, Jñ›nakırti (eighth/ninth century) says:As for those of highest capacities among the persons who exert them-selves in the p›ramit›s, when they perform the meditations of calmabiding and superior insight, even at the stage of ordinary beings, thisgrants them the true realization characterized by having its origin inMah›mudr›. Thus, this is the sign of irreversible [realization]. . . .All these results are accomplished through the meditation of the nondualtraining in Mah›mudr›. As the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasextensively say:Those who wish to train in the grounds of hearers should listento just this prajñ›p›ramit› . . . and should practice the yoga of justthis prajñ›p›ramit›.The Transmission of Madhyamaka from India to Tibet 53Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 53"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The same is said there for [those who wish to train] “in the groundsof solitary realizers” and “in the grounds of Buddhas.” Another nameof Mother Prajñ›p›ramit› is Mah›mudr›, because it is the very natureof nondual wisdom.169. . .Hence, the Blessed One’s teaching on the meditation of nondiscur-siveness is for the purpose of entering nondiscursiveness, that is, themeditation of the nondual training in Mah›mudr›.170Both The Treasury of Knowledge171and The Blue Annals172cite parts of these sec-tions from Jñ›nakırti’s text and agree that this Mah›mudr› systemis clearly explained in Sahajavajra’s Commentary on The Ten Verses onTrue Realityas the wisdom of suchness that has the three characteris-tics of its nature being p›ramit›, according with the secret mantra,and its name being “Mah›mudr›.”173In his Commentary on The Sublime Continuum, Gö Lots›wa relates this state-ment to the corresponding passages in Sahajavajra’s commentary.174These read:Since this master [Maitrıpa] gives a summarized explanation of thepith instructions of p›ramit› that accord with the mantra system,through the very being of the nature of phenomena that bears thename “prajñ›p›ramit›” . . . , he first pays his respect to the very natureof the three enlightened bodies.175andThe gist of this is:By not abiding on the side of the remedyAnd not being attached to true reality either,There is no wish for a result of anything whatsoever.Therefore, it is known as Mah›mudr›.Here, “Mah›mudr›” refers to the pith instructions on the true reality ofMah›mudr›, that is, thoroughly knowing the true reality of entities.176The text further says:The pith instructions of p›ramit› are the definite realization of Madh-yamaka that is adorned with the pith instructions of the guru.

Since she seals bliss through the nonabiding nirv› ̊a179. . . , sheis the seal. Since she is superior to karmamudr› and jñ›namudr› andfree from the latent tendencies of cyclic existence, she is great.180Thus, the explicit teaching of this Mah›mudr› is the Madhyamaka of emptinessfree from discursiveness as taught in the sÒtra system. Ultimately, Maitrıpa’s keynotion of “mental nonengagement” or “mental disengagement” is nothing butthe subjective side of what is called “freedom from discursiveness.” The only wayin which the mind can engage in this “object”—the absence of discursiveness—is precisely by not engaging in or fueling any discursiveness, thus letting it natu-rally settle on its own accord. In other words, the absence of reference points canbe realized only by a nonreferential mind, since this is the only perceptual modethat exactly corresponds to it. This is stated many times in the sÒtras. For exam-ple, The Prajñ›p›ramit› SÒtra in Seven Hundred Lines181says:Not abiding in anything whatsoever, this is the meditation on theperfection of knowledge. Not thinking about anything and not cog-nizing anything whatsoever, this is the meditation on the perfectionof knowledge.The Prajñ›p›ramit› SÒtra in Eight Thousand Linesagrees:This meditation on the perfection of knowledge means not meditat-ing on any phenomenon.182The Transmission of Madhyamaka from India to Tibet 55Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 55"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The SÒtra Requested by Ocean of Intelligent Insight183states:Do not mentally engage in phenomena.Completely abandon doing anything further.Realize all phenomenaAs equality in true reality.What is taught is application of mindfulnessWithout mindfulness or something to be mentally engaged.AtıŸa says in his Centrist Pith Instructions:For example, if you rub two sticks [against each other], fire comesforth. Through this condition, the two sticks are burned and becomenonexistent. Thereafter, the fire that has burned them also subsides byitself. Likewise, once all specifically characterized and generally char-acterized phenomena are established as nonexistent [through knowl-edge], this knowledge itself is without appearance, luminous, and notestablished as any nature whatsoever. Thus, all flaws, such as dullnessand agitation, are eliminated. In this interval, consciousness is withoutany thought, does not apprehend anything, and has left behind allmindfulness and mental engagement. For as long as neither charac-teristics nor the enemies and robbers of thoughts arise, consciousnessshould rest in such a [state].184Pawo Rinpoche clarifies what mental nonengagement means:Its meaning is to rest one-pointedly on the focal object [of medita-tion], without being distracted by other thoughts. If this [one-pointedresting] were stopped, all meditative concentrations would stop. There-fore, in general, “mental nonengagement” has the meaning of notmentally engaging in any object other than the very focus of the[respective] meditative concentration. In particular, when focusing onthe ultimate, [mental nonengagement] has the meaning of letting [themind] be without even apprehending this “ultimate.” However, thisshould not be understood as being similar to having fallen asleep.185Sahajavajra’sCommentary on The Ten Verses on True Realityagrees:In this context, “mental nonengagement” is not like closing your eyesand, just like [inanimate things, such as] a vase or a woolen cloth, not56The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 56"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"seeing anything at all. Here, there is no complete absence of mentalengagement.186In a very similar way, in both his commentary on The Dh›ra ̊ı of EnteringNonconceptualityand his Stages of Meditation,187KamalaŸıla repeatedly elaborateson this clear distinction between “mental nonengagement” and “the completeabsence of mental engagement”188(such as fainting, deep sleep, or just utter dull-ness), which is obviously not the point of meditating in order to realize ultimatereality. In the context of analytical meditation, he also emphasizes the need fordiscriminating analysis to precede mental nonengagement, since the ultimatecannot be realized without this step of analysis.The Eighth Karmapa says that, implicitly, this system of Mah›mudr› alsoteaches the profound actuality of both sÒtras and tantras, that is, the ordinary andextraordinary ultimate Heart of the Blissfully Gone Ones.189With this in mind,Gampopa, Pamo Truba190(1110–1170), Jigden Sumgön (1143–1217), and manyothers have said that “the treatise of our Mah›mudr› is this Treatise of the Sub-lime Continuum of the Great Vehicle191composed by the Blessed One Maitreya.”Götsangba Gönbo Dorje said that the initiators of this dharma of Mah›mudr›are both the Great Brahman Saraha and N›g›rjuna. Saraha taught Mah›mudr›from the side of affirmation, while N›g›rjuna taught it from the side of negation.The Blue Annalssays:This [system] that is known as “the glorious Tagbo Kagyü” is not a lin-eage of [mere] words. Rather, it is a lineage of the actuality [behindthese words]. “Actuality” refers to the lineage of realization of the stain-less Mah›mudr›. The guru from whom one receives this realization ofMah›mudr› is stated to be one’s root guru.192In his Treasure Vault of Mah›mudr›,193Padma Karpo gives a highly detailedaccount of all the main sources of the Mah›mudr› system and its relation toMadhyamaka, the sÒtras, and the tantras. On the basis of this, he clearly invali-dates all attacks by other Tibetans, such as that Mah›mudr› is not found in thesÒtras or that it is equal to the quietist Chinese Hvashang Mah›y›na approach194as it is reported to have been refuted in the debate at Samye195by KamalaŸıla. Karmapa Mikyö Dorje states that, in addition to the Kagyü lineage, manyothers in Tibet taught this dharma system of Mah›mudr›. For example, it iscontained in the teachings called The Pacification of Suffering196that the Indianmaster Padampa Sangye197brought to Tibet. In particular, we have the Mah› -mudr› transmissions to the great bodhisattva Tropu Lots›wa Jambay Bal198(1173?–1225) by many Indian scholars and siddhas, such as Mitrayogin199and thegreat Kashmiri Pa ̊ ̃ita ⁄›kyaŸrıbhadra (1140s–1225) who visited Tibet from 1204-The Transmission of Madhyamaka from India to Tibet 57Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 57"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"1213.

The Lineage from AtıŸaThis second transmission from N›g›rjuna via firyadeva, Candrakırti,204and theElder and Younger Vidy›kokila205reached AtıŸa (982–1054). It continued withDromtönpa (1005–1064),206Chen Ngawa Tsultrim Bar207(1033/38–1103), andJayülwa208(1075–1138). Then Gampopa received it from the latter and many otherKadampa masters. An alternative lineage went from AtıŸa via the Kadampa mas-ters Potowa (1031?–1105) and Sharawa209(1070–1141) directly to the First Karmapa.After him, the lineage continues as above.Here, the Eighth Karmapa addresses the issue of whether the Madhyamakateachings called Mah›mudr› that were transmitted by Maitrıpa and the Madh-yamaka teachings transmitted from AtıŸa are the same dharma system. In termsof the true reality that they teach, there is no difference, but they differ in theirapproach to realizing this actuality. In AtıŸa’s lineage, one determines true real-ity through conceptual examination and analysis. Then, one rests in meditativeequipoise through the knowledge that entails a small degree of clear appearancewith regard to the aspect of a nonimplicative negation.210In Maitrıpa’s system,just as a fire dies once its wood has been consumed, one determines the natureof this examining and analyzing knowledge itself through seeing that it is base-less and without root. Then one rests in meditative equipoise in that which doesnot involve any sense of negation or affirmation whatsoever.Gampopa had perfected the view and the meditations of calm abiding andsuperior insight in the Madhyamaka context according to the Kadampa systemwhen he came to Milarepa. When Gampopa offered his realization to him,Milarepa said, “As for the aspect of calm abiding in your practice, however goodall of this may be, it does not go beyond being a cause for rebirth in the higherrealms of sa ̇s›ra. As for the aspect practice of superior insight, all of this entailsthe danger of divergence into the four deviations from emptiness.211It may wellserve as a remedy for some portions of reification, such as clinging to real exis-tence. However, since it is not able to cut through the entirety of clinging toextremes, there is the danger that the whole complex of this excellent view andmeditation itself could turn into cognitive obscurations. Hence, if one is fettered,there is no difference between being fettered by an iron chain and being fetteredby a golden chain.” Later, Gampopa said about this, “If I had not met the greatmaster Milarepa, I would have risked rebirth as a long-lived god.” Thus, Gam-popa combined the systematic and analytical approach of the Kadampa teachings58The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 58"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"with the mainstream Kagyü instructions on Mah›mudr›, which led to him beingcalled “the one who united the two streams of Kadampa and Mah›mudr›.”III. The Lineage from Patsab Lots›wa Nyima TraThis lineage was transmitted from N›g›rjuna212to Candrakırti and then to hisdirect disciple MañjuŸrıkırti. It continued with Devacandra213(tenth century), theBrahman Ratnavajra214(tenth/eleventh century), Parahita (eleventh century),Mah›sumati215( eleventh/twelfth century), and Patsab Lots›wa (born 1055), whostudied in Kashmir for twenty-three years. He invited the Pa ̊ ̃ita Kanakavarmanto Tibet, translated many Madhyamaka treatises, and propagated Candrakırti’ssystem. Apart from Kanakavarman, in translating, he collaborated with a num-ber of other Indian Pa ̊ ̃itas, such as Mah›sumati, Jay›nanda, TilakakalaŸa,Mudit›Ÿrı, and SÒk ̋majana. Later, the First Karmapa Tüsum Khyenba exten-sively studied Madhyamaka with Patsab Lots›wa.216From the Karmapa, the lin-eage continues as above.Again, the question arises as to whether this Madhyamaka system and theMadhyamaka teachings that were transmitted from AtıŸa are an identical dharmasystem. The Eighth Karmapa says that not only are they identical, but even theirterminologies are alike. Still, in the system transmitted from Patsab Lots›wa, thepredominant approach is to determine the Centrist view through inferences thatresult from studying it. Then, through supreme knowledge in meditativeequipoise, one rests within the meaning to be validated that has been determinedthrough such inference. In AtıŸa’s system, one determines the view through allkinds of reasoned awareness that result from the triad of study, reflection, andmeditation. Then, through supreme knowledge in meditative equipoise, themind rests in a nonreferential manner within the object to be validated that hasbeen determined in such a way. One might wonder how the systems of PatsabLots›wa and AtıŸa differ as to cultivating the view and meditation of Madhya-maka. In terms of the teachings themselves, there is no difference. However, thedifference lies in the greater or lesser propensities of vigor and knowledge of theindividuals who dedicatedly apply themselves to the true reality of Madhyamaka.Still, it is not absolutely impossible that followers of Patsab may cultivate theview and meditation in accordance with AtıŸa’s system. Likewise, it is not ruledout that followers of AtıŸa may cultivate the view and meditation according to thesystem of Gampopa.As for the reading transmission and the tradition of scriptural exegesis ofMadhyamaka as these were known in Tibet during the time of Karmapa MikyöDorje, down to Patsab Lots›wa, they are as indicated in the three transmissionlineages above. After Patsab, they continue with Shang Tangsagba,217DromWangchug Tragba,218Sherab Dorje,219the two brothers Dentsül and Tragden,220The Transmission of Madhyamaka from India to Tibet 59Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 59"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Deway Lha,221Jotsün Uraba,222Sherab Pal,223Darma Sherab,224Pangdön SherabRinchen,225Sönam Senge,226Pangdön Samten Sangbo,227Pangdön ShönnuSamten,228Tangnagba,229Dashi Senge,230Shönnu Sangbo,231Sekangba Chötra,232Thangsagba Shönnu Gyaltsen,233Gyal Morongba Chenbo,234Jamchen RabjambaSangyay Phel,235Bumtra Sumba,236and the First Karma Trinlayba.

He says that even before, but especially after, the beginning of “the newtradition of Consequentialists” (Tsongkhapa’s novel interpretation of the Con-sequentialist system), the proponents of this earlier tradition had became as rareas stars in daylight. He specifically mentions the great translator Kyabcho Bal-sangbo,237the great Rendawa Shönnu Lodrö,238Dagtsang Lots›wa,239and thegreat tulkus of the Tagbo Kagyü together with some of their realized yogic dis-ciples.240There remains the question of whether there is a dharma system of Madhya-maka in the mantra vehicle that is different from the dharma system of Madh-yamaka as taught by N›g›rjuna and his spiritual heirs. The Eighth Karmapadeclares that there is no difference between the mantra vehicle and N›g›rjuna’sCentrism from the point of view of freedom from reference points. This meansthat once the objects of negation—clinging to extremes and clinging to referencepoints—have been relinquished, there is nothing whatsoever to be affirmed.However, the luminous wisdom mind that is explained in the sÒtras and theluminous wisdom mind explained in the tantras are not the same. If they werejust the same, either the tantric path would be indispensable as the means to real-ize the luminous mind as explained in the sÒtras, or the tantric path would besuperfluous for realizing the luminous mind as explained in the tantras, since thesame could be accomplished through the sÒtra path alone. Moreover, the lumi-nous mind in the sÒtras and the luminous mind in the tantras are explained tobe mutually exclusive in the sense of not coexisting. The Prajñ›p›ramit› SÒtra inEight Thousand Linessays:As for the mind, it is no-mind. The nature of the mind is luminosity.241According to Mikyö Dorje, the basis that is intended by this statement is theluminous mind as it is explained in the tantras. The purpose of saying that theactual nature of the mind (the six or eight consciousnesses) is luminosity is tounderstand that one attains the Buddhahood of the sÒtra approach through thepath of the sÒtras. Thus, the above quotation refers to the nondual wisdom mindthat “is without the mind that consists of apprehender and apprehended.” Theluminous mind of the tantras resides in all sentient beings in an unmanifest way.However, when it is about to become manifest, gradually all eight conscious-nesses, including their nature, completely vanish, until finally the luminous mindas described in the tantras dawns. Thus, in the Kagyü lineage, in talking aboutBuddhahood in the sÒtras and tantras, the same names are used for the groundbased on which Buddhahood is accomplished, the path that accomplishes it, andthe fruition that is accomplished. These names are “the Heart of the BlissfullyThe Transmission of Madhyamaka from India to Tibet 61Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 61"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Gone Ones,” “mind,” and “luminosity,” each one in terms of ground, path, andfruition. However, what is labeled by these terms is not the same in the sÒtras andtantras. Therefore, it is explained that the accomplishment of sÒtric Buddha-hood does not cover the attainment of tantric Buddhahood, whereas the accom-plishment of tantric Buddhahood incorporates sÒtric Buddhahood. This is theunmistaken vital dharma-eye of all sÒtras and tantras.One might wonder, “Is the Heart of the Blissfully Gone Ones not also taughtin the sÒtras?” It surely is taught, but only as a mere name. Since its full scope doesnot fit into the minds of the disciples of the sÒtra system, it is taught in a way thatis not to be taken literally. On the other hand, in the tantras, it is taught both inthis way and in a manner that is to be taken literally. In the sÒtras, the tantricmeaning is taught implicitly in a hidden manner, but the sÒtric path does notoperate with Buddha nature as it is taught in the tantras. Rather, on the basis ofthe six or eight consciousnesses, the sÒtric path causes the relinquishment of thetwo obscurations and the gathering of the two accumulations, which leads toattaining sÒtric Buddhahood. Therefore, in the sÒtras, Buddha nature is explainedas being unconditioned. On this basis of it being unconditioned, it is sometimesfurther interpreted as an entity and sometimes as an empty nonentity. With thefirst way of interpretation in mind, Dölpopa242and others have interpreted Bud-dha nature as an unconditioned entity that is permanent, lasting, and unchang-ing. Thinking of the second way of interpretation, the great translator NgogLots›wa interpreted Buddha nature as emptiness in the sense of a nonimplicativenegation, while firyavimuktisena and Haribhadra243have explained the expanseof dharmas (that is, the disposition that is the foundation for accomplishing theperfections) as emptiness.There are further distinctions between the Madhyamaka of the sÒtras and thetantras. The vajra vehicle contains the path of means—certain techniques for uti-lizing the central channel244—that serves to determine the freedom from referencepoints. This path is absent in the Madhyamaka system of the sÒtra approach. Inparticular, there is a difference as to whether both the view of the emptiness thatis intrinsically free from reference points yet endowed with the supreme of allaspects and the wisdom that leads to the realization of this view can dawn forbeginners through their mastery of certain secret essential points without the needto make any mental effort. Furthermore, there is a distinction as to the basis onwhich one cuts through reference points, that is, whether certain distinct featuresof the central channel are utilized as such a basis. Finally, in the Vajray›na, oneidentifies the bearers of the nature of phenomena—all of seeming reality—withthe name of a specific bearer of this nature: the designation “the nature of phe-nomena which is ultimate reality.” Through this, one can attain from these bear-ers of the ultimate nature the result that consists in a change of their state into theenlightened bodies and wisdoms that are the unity of the two realities.62The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 62"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"In general, there is not only a common view and purport in Madhyamaka,Mah›mudr›, and Vajray›na, but it is emphasized again and again that a thoroughunderstanding of Madhyamaka is crucial for the effectiveness of Vajray›na andMah›mudr› practices. No matter how many of these practices we may perform,none of them qualifies as Vajray›na or Mah›mudr›—even if outwardly they areperformed in a technically perfect way—if they lack the three indispensable fea-tures of the renunciation of cyclic existence, the altruistic motivation of the mindof enlightenment, and the view of emptiness. Tagbo Dashi Namgyal’s well-known Moonbeams of Mah›mudr›says:No matter whether this is based on analytical meditation or restingmeditation, it is in any case of great importance to find out the viewof emptiness. Any view and meditation that lack this [view] cannot cutthrough the root of [cyclic] existence.245No matter which progressive stages of meditation in the sÒtras, tantras,or pith instructions you look at, at first, when the [correct] view issearched for, discriminating knowledge is indispensable. . . . And yet,having analyzed through discrimination, finally the very [process of]discrimation itself comes to rest, ushering in nonconceptual [wis-dom].246What makes us thoroughly ascertain the correct view of emptiness is noneother than the Madhyamaka system. In fact, the presentations in the tantras andthe Mah›mudr› texts employ terms such as “emptiness,” “freedom from discur-siveness,” and “nonarising” all the time but usually do not elaborate on themmuch, because they take it for granted that persons who have arrived at theseadvanced practices have gone through a prior training in the view of emptiness.Here, the importance of Madhyamaka lies in its being a prerequisite and constantaid for the practices of Vajray›na and Mah›mudr›. This means not only that wemust have done our homework by familiarizing ourselves with the view of non-referentiality before engaging in these practices. More important, the uncom-promising Madhyamaka way of dealing with our clinging and mental referencepoints plays an important role in the experiential process of letting go of even themost subtle layers of fixating and what is fixated on along the path, be it grasp-ing at impure objects, pure objects, or the subjects that perceive such objects.Without going into the details, I will highlight a few issues to illustrate theprocess of undoing mental fixation. One of the central notions in Vajray›na iswhat is called unity, such as the unity of appearance and emptiness, the unity ofclarity and emptiness, the unity of bliss and emptiness, and the unity of aware-ness and emptiness. Obviously, without an understanding of each factor in theseThe Transmission of Madhyamaka from India to Tibet 63Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 63"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"four pairs, there is no way one can grasp the meaning of their unity. Here, unitydoes not at all refer to two distinct phenomena or features that are separate at firstand later joined through meditation. Rather, it refers to natural inseparabilitythat can be split up only conceptually, not experientially. For example, the unityof appearance and emptiness is to be understood in precisely the way The HeartSÒtra247teaches it:Form248is emptiness, emptiness is also form. Emptiness is no otherthan form and form is no other than emptiness.If we do not understand the oneness of appearance and emptiness and thenengage in, for example, deity visualizations, we will inevitably cling to the realexistence of these deities, just as we do with ordinary appearances. Or, we mighttry to annihilate or “emptify” ordinary, “impure” appearances through the mantraO ̇ svabh›va Ÿuddha ̄ sarvadharm› ̄ svabh›va Ÿuddho ‘ha ̇and then replace themwith the “real” and “pure” appearances of mandalas and deities (see also the fourdeviations from emptiness above).The explicit purpose of deity yoga is to serve as a remedy that reverses ourclinging to ordinary appearances. This is not accomplished through working onlywith the objective side of our experiences by replacing a bad movie with a betterone, that is, replacing impure appearances with pure appearances. Rather, themain focus lies on the subjective side, that is, mind itself as the projector of allthese movies. This means that the mind realizes all pure and impure appearances,including the mind itself, as being illusionlike—appearing while not really exist-ing. The crucial point is that this realization must be applied equally to the verymind that realizes it. To experience the unity of appearance and emptiness interms of both the perceiver and the perceived, the visualization practice of divineappearances must be constantly imbued with the view of their emptiness. How-ever, if there is any clinging to the real existence of mandalas and deities, to theircharacteristics (their shapes, colors, or mere luminous clarity) or to the wisdommind that meditates on all this, then the basic problem of clinging is not reme-died. Rather, it becomes even more solidified by grasping at something “pure”instead of something “impure.” As Milarepa said above, this kind of calm abid-ing only leads to rebirth as a god in higher realms of sa ̇s›ra. Moreover, it lacksthe aspect of superior insight. The starting and main point of superior insight invisualization practice is to look at the empty nature of all these forms that appearin the mind as well as at the looking mind itself. Also, when the visualization is dissolved at the end of the session, this is notmeant to annihilate the deities and their mandalas. Rather, it is a training in let-ting go of even our divine and pure objects of focus and then resting the mind64The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 64"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"in its uncontrived nature free from all reference points. At the end of this phaseof completion, we arise again as the deity, and the next meditation sessionstarts anew with emptiness and the mandala appearing from within it. Thus,we alternate between the creation stage,249in which appearance is emphasized,and the completion stage,250in which emptiness is emphasized. The first impor-tant purpose of this alternating between appearance and emptiness is to rem-edy the clinging to both of these. Dissolving the visualization is a technique thatremedies the clinging to its real existence, while its reappearance from empti-ness is a technique to remedy the clinging to some blank state without appear-ance. In actual fact, however, appearances and emptiness cannot be separated,as the empty nature of appearances is intrinsic to them. So the second impor-tant purpose of meditating on the stages of creation and completion is to trainin the nondiscriminatory experience of the inseparable unity of appearance andemptiness, which is possible only on the basis of not clinging to either facet ofthis unity. In this way, we become familiar with the true nature of mind with-out getting stuck in either its luminous or its empty aspect. ⁄›kya Chogden251says:If there were not the way in which nondual wisdom is empty of natureThat is elucidated by the texts of Consequentialists and Autonomists,What would relinquish our clinging to profound luminous wisdom’s realityAnd our conceptions of being attached to magnificent deities?252The necessity for a background in the Madhyamaka view is also highly evidentin the teachings on Mah›mudr›. In general, Centrist texts are regularly quotedand notions such as “emptiness,” “freedom from discursiveness and referencepoints,” and “neither arising nor ceasing” abound. In particular, among the well-known four yogas of Mah›mudr›,253the second is so named because, with thevision of emptiness predominating, it is the realization that mind and all otherphenomena do not arise, abide, or cease and are free from any discursiveness andreference points. The third yoga refers to realizing the equality of mind andappearances, cyclic existence and nirv› ̊a, empty and not empty, and so on, allbeing of “one taste” in that they lack a nature of their own. The fourth yoga isthe level of nothing to meditate on, no meditator, and no meditation, neitheranything to be realized nor any realization. In particular, an experiential familiarity with the Madhyamaka approach iscrucial for the stages of Mah›mudr› insight meditation, when mind is investi-gated in its various expressions of stillness and movement. The instructions forthese analytical meditations are very concise, but they often follow exactly theThe Transmission of Madhyamaka from India to Tibet 65Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 65"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"lines of more detailed Madhyamaka analyses. It is true that, in Mah›mudr›analysis, the emphasis lies on directly and nonconceptually looking at the mind,but obviously this is not accomplished right away. Naturally, beginners startinvestigating in a conceptual way. In this context, any resultant conceptualinsight into emptiness is helpful only if it eventually proves to be conducive tothe immediate kind of introspection. Hence, such insight is an obstacle if oneclings to an intellectual understanding of emptiness. However, the same is truefor the Madhyamaka approach, which indeed starts on the more intellectualplane but constantly points to and facilitates direct experience and insights intoemptiness (this is what is meant by “experiential familiarity,” mentioned above).In both the Madhyamaka and the Mah›mudr› approaches, one must graduallylet go of conceptual understanding, reification, and hanging on to any referencepoint at all.Thus, without being aware of the actual thrust of the Mah›mudr› investiga-tions of mind and appearances, we might either try to skip them altogether or justgo through the motions and think, “Of course, I know that my mind has nocolor and shape.” When we do not personally engage in scrutinizing our mindfrom different aspects and angles within the states of both stillness and move-ment, we just keep getting caught up in the experiences that rush through thismind. In this way, we completely miss the point of such an analysis as an activeprocess from our own side to eradicate misperceptions and approach the liberat-ing insight into the true nature of the experiencing mind itself. As the NinthKarmapa’s famous Mah›mudr› text The Ocean of Definitive Meaningsays:Some may wonder, “It is fine to demonstrate right from the start thatthis mind can neither be watched nor seen, but beyond that, what isthe point in investigating [whether it has a] color and so on?” It is pre-cisely because sentient beings do not realize that mind—which lacks anature—definitely does not have such [color and so forth] that they,since time without beginning, take what they call “me” and “I” to besomething real. Based on that, attachment, aversion, and ignorancearise, and thus they wander in cyclic existence, the ocean of suffering.In order to put an end to that, you [must] probe into the depths ofyour own mind, the main root of cyclic existence, through investigat-ing, examining, and analyzing [it]. Thus, through determining it to beempty and without identity, it is certain that you see the unmistakenactuality of the basic nature. Through being certain that mind lacks anature, you realize that the mistakenness of clinging to any identity ofcyclic existence is without reality. By the force of that, you are certainthat all phenomena are empty. Consequently, your attachment to allworldly pursuits is put to an end, and the root of reification, the cause66The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 66"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"of cyclic existence, is cut through. Therefore, there is good reason forinvestigating the mind.254Tagbo Dashi Namgyal’s Great Manual for Guidance in Mah›mudr›, Called Elu-cidating Natural True Realityagrees:You might wonder, “Is it not sufficient to embrace whatever appearsin the mind with mindfulness from the very start, without needinggradual steps of guidance?” Such might suffice for the rare few whosekarmic disposition is of the instantaneous type. However, in [all] othercases, unless one is led through the gradual steps of guidance, doubtsabout the root of mind and appearances are not resolved, and the cer-tainty that entails the experience of seeing [one’s] nature will not dawn.Hence, although there may be other [kinds of] mindfulness, thingswill not work out [as they should], since there is no self-aware mind-fulness.255The same master’s Moonbeams of Mah›mudr›frequently quotes Madhyamakatexts as its sources besides the words of the great siddhas of Mah›mudr› andstates:For the most part, these instructions . . . appear to have the sameessential points as the progressive stages of meditation in the sÒtraapproach as [found in] The Prajñ›p›ramit› Pith Instructions,256KamalaŸıla’s three-volume Stages of Meditation,257and AtıŸa’s CentristPith Instructions.258First, one analyzes [the mind] through discriminating knowledge. It isexplained that, through this, the very [process of] discrimination itselfcomes to rest, upon which nonconceptual wisdom dawns.259Here, the way of determining the nature of the mind is similar to thedetermination of personal identitylessness in the sÒtra approach. . . .Likewise, the way of determining thoughts and appearances is similarto the determination of phenomenal identitylessness in the sÒtraapproach.260However excellent a meditation in which insight has not arisen may be,it is nothing more than one of the various kinds of mundane medita-tions of non-Buddhists or ordinary Buddhists. Other than that, if such[meditation] does not even qualify as a meditation of the lower [Bud-The Transmission of Madhyamaka from India to Tibet 67Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 67"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"dhist] vehicles, it is needless to mention that it does not qualify as ameditation of the great vehicle, such as Madhyamaka or, particularly,Mah›mudr›. For that reason, it is very important to seriously engagein the meditation of insight.26168The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 68"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"T2The Middle from Beginning to EndMadhyamaka is most generally classifiedas the actual Madhyamaka (thatwhich is to be communicated) and the verbal Madhyamaka (the means to com-municate this actuality). The actual Madhyamaka is presented as threefold:1) Madhyamaka ground: the unity of the two realities. The two realities are seem-ing reality and ultimate reality. On the level of seeming reality, conventionallyspeaking, all phenomena are nothing but mere collections of causes and con-ditions. Our labels that emerge based on these phenomena are just superim-posed, conventional designations that are coined in an interdependent way.Ultimately, however, phenomena are not to be found as any of the extremesof our mental reference points, such as existing, not existing, arising, or ceas-ing. They are also free from abiding in a so-called middle. Thus, it is the natureof all these fleeting phenomena to appear while not having any identifiablenature of their own, very much like rainbows or reflections in a mirror. Thisis the unity of the two realities.2) Madhyamaka path: the unity of the seeming mind of enlightenment and theultimate mind of enlightenment, or the unity of means and knowledge.Through understanding the modes of being of the two realities in this way,bodhisattvas realize that seeming reality consists of phenomena that are merelynominal. Since all phenomena are free from arising and so on, they are real-ized to be free from all mistaken superimpositions. The unity of the seemingmind of enlightenment and the ultimate mind of enlightenment is to train inthe illusionlike means to accomplish the benefit of oneself and others whileconstantly being immersed in the knowledge that realizes the nature of all phe-nomena. This means developing dependently originating and illusionlike greatcompassion for countless dependently originating and illusionlike sentientbeings who have all been our loving mothers at some point in the infiniteround of cyclic existence. Motivated by this compassion, bodhisattvas train inthe illusionlike and spacelike two accumulations of merit and wisdom thatcomprise the six or ten perfections.262Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 69"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"3) Madhyamaka fruition: the unity of the Dharma Body and the Form Bodies.The fruition of this training is as follows: Through having reached the culmi-nation of the most lucid appearance of the ultimate mind of enlightenment,all afflictive, cognitive, and meditational obscurations including their latenttendencies are eliminated and all mental reference points have vanished. Thisis the perfect accomplishment of one’s own welfare: the Dharma Body.Through having arrived at the culmination of the most lucid appearance of theseeming mind of enlightenment, the perfect accomplishment of the welfare ofothers—the Form Bodies—is attained. This accomplishment for others meanscomplete mastery of enlightened activity that manifests from the perspectiveof all countless sentient beings to be trained until the end of time and space.The unity of these two kinds of enlightened bodies means that, while theDharma Body never moves away from its natural state of luminous spacious-ness, the Form Bodies manifest as the effortless and spontaneous activities ofenlightened body, speech, and mind (such as turning the wheel of dharma)that are naturally in perfect harmony with every single sentient being.The verbal Madhyamaka as the means to express this threefold actuality ofground, path, and fruition are the teachings of the Buddha and the treatises ofthe great M›dhyamika masters such as N›g›rjuna. These treatises comment onthe words of the Buddha in two ways. First, they comment on the intentions of“the Madhyamaka scriptures of the ordinary vehicles,” that is, the teachings ofmainly the expedient meaning that were spoken with certain intentions. Throughthis, they help practitioners realize that there are no internal contradictions in thewords of the Buddha and that his words cannot be invalidated through reason-ing. In this way, the students’ trust and confidence in the Buddha as the Omnis-cient One become irreversible and increase further and further. Second, thesetreatises comment on the ultimate actuality that is expressed by “the Madhya-maka scriptures of the extraordinary great vehicle,” which are the teachings of thedefinitive meaning that do not entail any other intentions or implications. Thus,the texts generate confidence in the definitive meaning in those who are suitablefor it and provide for their relief from all obscurations on the great paths andgrounds of bodhisattvas.As for the persons who are called Centrists, there are two levels. Those on thefirst level uphold the Centrist view by following master N›g›rjuna and under-stand the meaning of the texts that say that all phenomena are without nature.Centrists on the second level are described by Candrakırti as those in whose men-tal continua the realization of Centrism has dawned and whose realization is inconcordance with the realization of the noble ones of all three vehicles. For bodhi-sattvas, this realization begins on the path of seeing of the great vehicle. Thus,noble bodhisattvas are those who are able to rest in meditative equipoise within70The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 70"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"the nature of phenomena through having cultivated the specific knowledge of thispath in meditation. In general, this means that all those noble ones of the secondlevel—learners and nonlearners—who rest in meditative equipoise within thenature of phenomena are the actual Centrists. Those among these noble oneswho abide within the phase of subsequent attainment263and thus engage in var-ious activities on the level of seeming reality as well as all ordinary beings whouphold the Centrist view without having directly realized it are called “Centristswho follow common worldly consensus.”Thus, as for upholding the Madhyamaka view and having realized it, there arefour possibilities. There are (1) people who uphold the Madhyamaka view andin whose continua its realization has not arisen, (2) those in whose continua itsrealization has arisen and who do not uphold the Madhyamaka view, (3) thosefor whom both are the case, and (4) those for whom neither is the case.Among these, the second possibility might require some explanation. Accord-ing to Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, there surely are cases of bodhisattvas who have real-ized the actuality of Madhyamaka but who—for the sake of training certain kindsof beings to be trained—do not uphold the view of Madhyamaka. However, itis impossible that they do not uphold the final intended meaning of this view,because it is impossible for the noble ones of the great vehicle to say somethingmistaken about the view and the accomplishment of the two realities, since theyhave directly realized ultimate reality. Then, there are also beings such as thenoble ones among the hearers and solitary realizers who indeed have accom-plished the actual Madhyamaka, since its realization has been born in them.However, they do not uphold the view of Madhyamaka, since their insight hasnot properly engaged in the scriptural system of Centrism. Therefore, their mindshave not been trained in the conventions of Centrist view and accomplishment.The only exceptions to this are those noble ones among the hearers and solitaryrealizers who have the highest capacities. For, once the basic nature of Madhya-maka just as it is has been realized through the path, the self-confidence of theknowledge that grows from this path cannot be subdued. This knowledge thatarises in meditation is at the same time the means to unmistakenly express theactual Madhyamaka of the basic nature. Once such knowledge has been devel-oped, there is not the slightest difficulty in teaching others the actuality that isexperienced by it.Another example of one who has realized the actual Madhyamaka while notupholding its view is an ordinary being in whose mind stream the realization ofMadhyamaka may arise through the power of cultivating the exemplary wisdomand the two stages of creation and completion in the Vajray›na. Of course, thisperson does not know how to express the Madhyamaka view. Nevertheless, thereare cases of such Vajray›na practitioners who have not been trained in the con-ventional terms of Madhyamaka and who still display the power to explain theThe Middle from Beginning to End 71Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 71"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Madhyamaka view, debate about it, and even compose treatises on it. All this isthe result of removing blockages in the free flow of n› ̃ı, pr› ̊a, and bindu. Andeven for ordinary beings in whom the realization of the actual Madhyamaka hasnot yet arisen, it is possible that a moment of self-confident knowledge couldemerge that causes them to propound the Madhyamaka view just as it is.Through this, they may rise as indisputable guides who in the middle of an oceanof opponents can eliminate all kinds of wrong views. Such can happen throughthe power of intense devotion to the guru and the three jewels or through theforce of overwhelming compassionate accumulations of merit that are motivatedby the mind of enlightenment for the sake of all beings.In general, however, all who uphold and proclaim what is called “the Madh-yamaka view”— whether they are noble beings in whom realization has arisen orordinary beings in whom it has not—do so only for the sake of putting an endto the wrong views of others, that is, solely from the perspective of those whoentertain such views and suffer through them. Thus, when Centrists “uphold” theview of Madhyamaka and present its ground, path, and fruition, they never putthis forward as a system of their own in which they believe. The reason is that theysimply do not present anything whatsoever as their own system and that “uphold-ing this view” refers to nothing but the process of helping other people to freethemselves from clinging to any kind of view or system. In this way, somethingthat looks like a Madhyamaka “system” or “school” can only emerge in the dia-logues that Centrists may have with others. This also explains why all Madhya-maka texts mainly consist of refutations of the positions of others. The reason forall these refutations lies not in mere sophistry or nihilism on the part of Centrism,but in the fact that all conceptual constructions are by their nature incapable ofreally capturing phenomena and their nature, be it on the seeming or the ultimatelevel. Rather, they only obscure our direct perception of how things really are andthus lead to mistaken actions and suffering.T Madhyamaka GroundWhat Is Reality?The ground of the Madhyamaka system is the correct view on the two realities.As The SÒtra of the Meeting of Father and Sonsays:Without having learned this from others,The Knower of the World distinguished these two realities.The one is the seeming and the other the ultimate—There is no other third reality.72The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 72"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"In general, the Sanskrit word satyacan mean both “truth” and “reality.” In thecontext of the two “realities” in Centrism, this term refers to realities in the sensethat what is experienced in some way by someone is that person’s individual real-ity, no matter how delusive this experience might be from the perspective of oth-ers. It is like when we say that someone “lives in a different reality.” We do notmean that this person does not live on this planet but that her or his view or per-ception of things is not the same as ours. This is even more obvious in people whogo insane and live completely in their own world, not because they went to some“Crazy Disney World” located somewhere else but because the entire experien-tial framework of their minds has changed. In Centrism, reality is understood inan experiential or perceptual sense and not ontologically as some hard-and-fast“real existence” in a substantial, independent, or absolute manner. Rather, thisnotion of real existence is precisely what Centrists keep denying. So for them,“realities” refer to different types of experiences of individual beings, withoutthere being some independent reality somewhere. In other words, Centristswould not say, “The truth is out there.” This means that seeming reality does notexist apart from the minds of the ordinary sentient beings whose experience it is.Likewise, ultimate reality is not some absolute or transcendent given. It does notexist anywhere other than in the minds of noble ones who rest in meditativeequipoise within the nature of phenomena. The manifold expressions of seem-ing reality in different beings are usually compared to the various dream experi-ences of different sleepers. None of the episodes in their dreams has any correlatein any real outer reality, but at the time of dreaming, everything that is experi-enced is subjectively completely real. Ultimate reality is compared to waking upfrom the dream and realizing that none of the events in one’s dream ever hap-pened as anything other than a mere appearance in one’s own mind. As Can-drakırti says in his Entrance into Centrism: It is through the perfect and the false seeing of all entitiesThat the entities that are thus found bear two natures.The object of perfect seeing is true reality,And false seeing is seeming reality.264As a simplified analogy, consider the well-known computerized pictures withthree-dimensional effects (called “Magic Eye” and the like). If we look at one ofthese two-dimensional pictures and do not focus on any of its details but basicallylook through it, the picture appears as a completely different three-dimensionalimage. Nothing new is added to the two-dimensional picture itself when thethree-dimensional image is seen, and there is also no other spatial reality behindthis flat sheet of paper. The only thing that has changed is the way of looking atit. However, this is precisely what makes all the difference. Since we can experi-The Middle from Beginning to End 73Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 73"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"ence substantial changes in our perception in such a simple way, how can we ruleout even more dramatic expansions of our minds, if we work in a systematic andall-encompassing manner on our way of seeing the world?Since the two realities refer to experiences or perceptions, they are not justsome abstract conceptual or formal truths (such as “one plus one equals two”).Also, when we see a table or hear a sound, we would not think of this as seeingor hearing a “truth,” nor would we conceive the perceiving consciousness itselfas a “truth.” Rather, we refer to both the objects and the perceiving subject assome kind of reality that we perceive or experience. As Broido rightly says:Truth is a property of sentences (relativized to contexts) or, philo-sophically, a property of propositions, but in any case not a propertyof cognitions or cognitive states or appearances or experiences or“things.” It is only with a very great sense of strain that an English-speaker can say of a visual object or experience that it is true or false.. . . Given this strain and the resulting confusion it is not surprisingthat many Western accounts of the satyas are unintelligible.265Moreover, in terms of the Buddhist path, mere “truths” do not have any lib-erating power per se; only realizations that have been fully integrated into one’smind as experiential realities have such power. For example, it is widely acceptedthat smoking is hazardous to one’s health, but all smokers who have tried to quitknow equally well that it takes much more than just this truth to actually changeaddictive patterns.Thus, the two realities are not understood merely as general truths (of course,they are also formally true) but as the individual realities that are experienced byeither the mistaken minds of sentient beings or the unmistaken wisdom mindsof noble ones.266These realities encompass both the objective and the subjectivesides of experience. The objects that we see, hear, and so forth, including thevarious kinds of consciousness that perceive these objects, are our reality; andwhat the nobles ones perceive is “their” reality.Therefore, in Centrism, the distinction of the two realities is not an ontologi-cal one but primarily epistemological. This means that we are not talking abouttwo separate sets of reality that independently and objectively exist in two differ-ent realms called sa ̇s›ra and nirv› ̊a. Rather, the two realities refer to just whatis experienced by two different types of beings with different types and scopes ofperception. More important still, since the overall purport of the teachings of theBuddha is liberation from cyclic existence, the presentation of the two realities andtheir relation is nothing but a means to this end. Since this presentation is usedas a pedagogical tool for accomplishing liberation, the actual contrast between thetwo realities is soteriological in nature. The dividing line is drawn between what74The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 74"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"is delusive or seeming in the sense of being unreliable when seeking for liberationfrom cyclic existence and what is genuine or ultimate in the sense of being reli-able as the appropriate basis for such liberation. As Pawo Rinpoche says:[The seeming] is not a stable reality, because it does not withstandanalysis and because it does not appear as an object of the meditativeequipoise of the noble ones. . . . [The ultimate] is “genuine,” becauseit is essential for those who wish for liberation and undeceiving withrespect to the result, which is Buddhahood.267The presentation of the difference between seeming and ultimate reality togetherwith the ensuing activities on a seeming path are regarded as the means to achievethe direct realization of what is called ultimate reality. N›g›rjuna says in his Fun-damental Verses:Without reliance on conventions,The ultimate cannot be taught.Without realization of the ultimate,Nirv› ̊a cannot be attained.268Thus, the presentation of the two realities is in itself an aspect of the bod-hisattvas’ skill in means, but within this educational approach, neither of thesetwo realities is “better” or more real than the other. The reason for this is thatall presentations and practical applications of these two can only happen withinthe framework of seeming reality itself, since they only need to be taught tothose who have an essentially dualistic state of mind. As such, these two cannotbut be mutually dependent and dualistic, since it is impossible to talk about,reflect on, or meditate on the one without the other. Likewise, there is no wayto proceed on the path to “the ultimate” without using and eventually lettinggo of seeming reality. On the other hand, within the meditative equipoise ofthose who directly perceive what is called ultimate reality, all reference points ofa dualistic mind have completely subsided. Thus, any arguments about what isseeming, ultimate, real, or false are by definition simply irrelevant to this per-ceptual perspective. The SÒtra That Teaches the Unity of the Nature of the Expanseof Dharmas269says:O MañjuŸrı, when the expanse of dharmas is taken as the source ofvalid cognition, there is neither seeming reality nor ultimate reality.Pawo Rinpoche states:The Middle from Beginning to End 75Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 75"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"It is for the native nature of all phenomena, the very expanse of dhar -mas just as it is, . . . that the conventional term “ultimate reality” isused. . . . This is what abides as the actual nature of all phenomena. Itis the object of the profound meditative equipoise of noble ones.Therefore, it is presented as a stable reality in dependence on the seem-ing. [However,] it is not [such a stable reality] independently throughits nature, because the Buddhas themselves behold neither real nordelusive phenomena.270It is definitely stated that all phenomena have one single reality andthat just this that is called “real” or “delusive” is not observed. Never-theless, in order for naïve beings271to be able to leave their fear behind,the provisional presentation of subject and object is [given as] some-thing that leaves the status quo of mere common worldly consensus asit is. Thus, naïve beings are guided by using the conventional term“seeming reality.”272Candrakırti says in his Lucid Words:What is taught as arising and such in terms of dependent originationdoes not concern the nature of the objects of the uncontaminated wis-dom of those free from the blurred vision273of basic ignorance. Rather,it is [taught] with respect to the objects of the consciousnesses of thosewhose eyes of intelligent insight are affected by the blurred vision ofbasic ignorance.274We teach the delusiveness of entities with regard to seeming reality asa remedy against [the beliefs of] worldly people who cling to this [delu-siveness] as being real. However, the noble ones who have accom-plished what is to be accomplished do not see anything that is delusiveor not delusive. Moreover, for those who have realized the delusivenessof all phenomena, do karma and cyclic existence exist? They do notobserve any phenomenon as either existent or non-existent.275From the perspective of the meditative equipoise of noble ones who realize theultimate, experientially there is only “one reality.” However, it may be conceivedor designated in various ways when these noble ones engage in their activities inorder to help others so that they too may realize this reality. The Sixty Stanzas onReasoningstates:That nirv› ̊a is the sole reality76The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 76"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Is what the Victors have declared.276AtıŸa’s Entrance into the Two Realitiesdeclares:The ultimate is just a single one.Others assert it to be twofold.The nature of phenomena is not established as anything whatsoever,So how could it be two or three and such?277No Ground for the Two RealitiesIn general, there are various presentations of the two realities in the differentBuddhist philosophical systems up through the Autonomists. All their presenta-tions agree on the following general points (Autonomists doing so just conven-tionally) about ultimate reality: (1) it cannot be invalidated through reasoning, (2)it withstands analysis, (3) it abides ultimately as an undeceiving nature, and (4)it is the object of an unmistaken subject. Seeming reality is defined as the oppo-site of this.As for Consequentialists, one looks in vain for their own special presentationof the two realities. Rather, when they dispel the mistakenness in the minds ofthose who uphold philosophical systems, they do so by simply putting an end towrong views through demonstrating the inconsistencies of any position in termsof an actually or substantially existing ultimate. When Consequentialists describewhat is to be adopted and rejected by giving their own presentations of seemingreality, they do not use specific new terms to establish a system of their own thatexplains this process. Rather—both in terms of everyday life and the Buddhistpath—they engage in what is to be adopted and rejected in a way that is adjustedto the conventions of “correct” and “false” as these accord with common worldlyconsensus without analysis. To support this approach, they point to the Buddha,who taught the two realities in accordance with such conventions merely for thesake of helping worldly beings to finally realize true reality:The world disputes with me, but I do not dispute with the world.Whatever is asserted as existent in the world, that I assert as existenttoo. Whatever is asserted as nonexistent in the world, that I assert asnonexistent too.278When Centrists talk about common worldly consensus or the perspective with-out analysis, they usually make a distinction between ordinary people whoseminds have not been altered by philosophical views and people whose mindshave been so altered. Common worldly consensus is then identified as what isThe Middle from Beginning to End 77Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 77"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"consensus among those who have not been affected in this sense. However, it isobvious that there is no single universal set of things about which there is com-mon consensus in the world, even when leaving aside philosophical views in astrict sense. There are an endless number of regional or social views or consen-sus on almost all issues, and in the end, majority vote or custom in a given soci-ety or group is what determines the local sets of consensus. Thus, the famousTibetan master Gendün Chöpel (1903–1951) said that, basically, there is nobodywhose mind is not affected by some sort of view. The only difference concernswhat kind of view. Some people are affected by the views of their parents or theirsocial group; others may be affected by certain religious, scientific, or political the-ories. In light of this, it seems impossible to pinpoint anything as commonworldly consensus among people who are not affected by a view, since such peo-ple simply seem to be nonexistent. Thus, such consensus does not refer to cer-tain social conventions, scientific theories, or commonly held views that peoplemore or less consciously agree on.Can we find another way to determine the type of common consensus that isunaffected by views? It is hard to draw a sharp line here, but according to Cen-trists like Candrakırti, ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, and Gendün Chöpel, this common consen-sus refers to our direct nonconceptual experiences and sense perceptions.Conceptual cognitions, except for merely labeling what we experience in thisway, represent for the most part the kind of consciousness that is already affectedby some view. Candrakırti is reported to have pointed to his robe and said, “Ifyou ask me what this is, I would say this is Candrakırti’s robe. If you ask mewhat the building behind me is, I would say it is N›land› University. Other thanthat, I have nothing to say.”Thus, common worldly consensus in the Centrist sense primarily refers to thevery basic things that we perceive and label by taking them for granted, usuallywithout even thinking about them, such as that we eat when we feel hungry,that fire burns, that water flows downhill, that there is a world of people outthere who are different from ourselves, and that we want to be happy and avoidsuffering. These appearances of seeming reality are what determine our ordinarybehavior. If they are not analyzed, they seem to be there and—mostly—functionas we expect them to. Usually, our bodies are still there when we wake up in themorning and function in the same way as yesterday. Then, we feed them and takethe same road to the same place where we have been working for many years.However, as soon as we start to analyze these appearances for what they really are,they start to lose their characteristics and functions, because we step out of ourfamiliar frame of reference within which these appearances manifest and operate.This is also obvious from modern science: For example, according to quantumphysics, there are no such things as matter, roads, cars, or bodies, so who or whatis driving home after an exciting day in the quantum lab? On the other hand, sub-78The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 78"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"jectively, we do not live our lives by behaving as quantum fields or the like. Wedo not relish quarks and energy waves but eat pancakes and drink coffee. Thus,one could say that common worldly consensus is mainly that which we take forgranted in our everyday transactions and which functions accordingly as long asit is not questioned.In more technical terms, the Eighth Karmapa says that “worldly” refers to allmental activities under the sway of afflictive and cognitive obscurations throughwhich the dualistic appearances of apprehender and apprehended on the level ofseeming, worldly reality are imagined, as well as all thoughts and expressions independence on this imagining that are used by those who experience dualisticappearances. On this level of the worldly seeming, the conventions of everythingin both the world and the treatises that is already consensus or suitable to becomesome consensus are called “the conventions of the worldly seeming.” As ⁄›ntidevasays:Thus, two kinds of world are seen:The one of yogins and the one of common people.Here, the world of common peopleIs invalidated by the world of yogins.Also the yogins, due to differences in insight,Are overruled by successively superior ones.279The Centrist presentation of the two realities is in no way established as aCentrist system of its own. Rather, such descriptions are used as mere labels.When they are analyzed, neither a defining characteristic nor an example of ulti-mate reality can be found. Thus, all that is left on the side of Consequentialistsin their communications with others are mere nominal definienda that give theimpression of being defined by certain defining characteristics. However, sincesuch names are also empty of a nature of their own, ultimate emptiness is evenbeyond being an object of the wisdom of noble ones. So how could anybodyfind a nature that makes up or defines this emptiness? One might argue with the Consequentialists’ refusal to take a position regard-ing the ultimate by saying, “As was said above, the defining characteristics ofultimate reality are that it (1) cannot be invalidated through reasoning, (2) with-stands analysis, (3) abides ultimately as an undeceiving nature, and (4) is theobject of an unmistaken subject. So, ultimately speaking, is there such a phe-nomenon or not? If there is, you Consequentialists are realists.280If there isn’t, thepresentation of the two realities is meaningless.” The Eighth Karmapa respondsthat Consequentialists do not claim that, ultimately, there is an ultimate realitythat is endowed with such defining characteristics, since they also do not claimThe Middle from Beginning to End 79Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 79"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"that, ultimately, there is a seeming reality that has the opposite defining charac-teristics. The reason for this is that both realities are just presented in mutualdependence. Moreover, it is not only impossible to establish an ultimate realitywith such defining characteristics through any valid cognition whatsoever, but thenotion of such an ultimate reality can also be invalidated through reasoning.Thus, the two realities are primordially natural emptiness in which all flux ofmental reference points is completely absent, be these subject or object, definingcharacteristics, definiendum, and example; or valid cognition, what is to be val-idated, and the result of validation. All presentations of the inexpressible andinconceivable that are made from the perspective of ordinary beings by conven-tionally referring to “ultimate reality” are nothing but a futile attempt to writewords onto space. However, the Buddha and N›g›rjuna explain that such expo-sitions are still given for the sake of dispelling the wrong ideas of those who mis-conceive the two realities as something that has characteristics (such as realexistence) versus something that is the fundamental nature of knowable objects.Particularly, if no presentation of ultimate reality is provided, profound true real-ity as it actually is will not be realized. The sÒtras say:If the ultimate did not exist, pure conduct would be meaningless andthe appearance of Thus-Gone Ones would be pointless. Since the ulti-mate exists, bodhisattvas should be skilled in the ultimate.In summary, nonnominal, profound, and ultimate emptiness that is the actualobject of the wisdom of noble ones is free from either withstanding or not with-standing analysis. As such, it is beyond expression. On the other hand, the nom-inal281emptiness that is the object of a correct reasoning consciousness is surelynot something that can withstand analysis. Nevertheless, Centrists apply namessuch as “ultimate reality” or “emptiness” to that which is essentially withoutname and constitutes true reality. Thus, since they use such illustrating designa-tions, one cannot say that Centrists are unable to conventionally express this ulti-mate reality. As will be explained further, this is an essential point in Centrism.The Detailed Explanation of the Two RealitiesThe essential points on the two realities having been elucidated, the ground nowseems properly prepared for a slight elaboration on this conventional distinction.The Meaning of the TermsThe Sanskrit term for “the seeming” is sa ̇v ̧ti(Tib. kun rdzob), which literallymeans “to completely cover, conceal, or obscure.” This is also given as its main80The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 80"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"sense in the twenty-fourth chapter of Candrakırti’s Lucid Words, in which helists three meanings of this term:1) Seeming means completely obscuring, since ignorance completely blocks thetrue reality of things.2) The seeming bears this name because it is mutually dependentand thus notindependently or truly existent. This includes everything that is merely estab-lished in dependence on something else (such as something being long andshort respectively) as well as all that originates in dependence on various causesand conditions.3) Seeming also refers to signs and symbols, that is, to worldly conventions andexpressions. This not only refers to language or conventional terms butencompasses all objects of expression, means of expression, knowing con-sciousnesses, and knowable objects.282The Treasury of Knowledgereports two more meanings:4) Bh›vaviveka’s Blaze of Reasoningsays that “the seeming refers to the completediversificationof all entities, such as forms.”2835) The seeming is make-believeor pretense. As Haribhadra says, “It is seeming,because it does not withstand the force of analysis.”284Thus, seeming reality (sa ̇v ̧tisatya) is called seeming because basic ignoranceobscures the seeing of true reality. It is still called a reality, because naïve beingstake it to be real and because it functions in accordance with how it is perceiveduntil true reality is realized. This is the only way in which it is undeceiving forsentient beings.The Sanskrit term for the ultimate is param›rtha(Tib. don dam). Parama(Tib. dam pa) means “supreme or ultimate,” and arthameans “object, purpose,or actuality.” Bh›vaviveka’s Blaze of Reasoninglists three different ways in whichthe compound of these two words can be read in Sanskrit:1) Since it is an object and ultimate, it is the ultimate object. (2) Or,[it may be read as] “the object of the ultimate”: Since it is the objectof ultimate nonconceptual wisdom, it is the object of the ultimate. (3)Or, it [can be understood as] “that which is in accordance with theultimate object”: Since the ultimate object exists in the knowledge thatis in approximate accordance with the realization of this ultimateobject, it is that which is in accordance with the ultimate object.285The first way to understand this means that both paramaand artharefer only toThe Middle from Beginning to End 81Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 81"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"the object—emptiness—as opposed to the subject that realizes it.286The secondalternative means that paramarefers to the subject (wisdom) and arthato theobject (emptiness).287The third option indicates a reasoning consciousness thatcognizes ultimate reality not directly but inferentially.288The majority of Auton-omists seem to favor the second way of reading param›rtha, while not denyingthe first. Consequentialists usually follow Candrakırti’s Lucid Words,which con-firms the first reading:Since it is both an object and ultimate, it is the ultimate object. Sincejust this is real, it is ultimate reality.289Thus, ultimate reality (param›rthasatya) is called ultimate because it is the ulti-mate sphere of nonconceptual wisdom in the meditative equipoise of noble ones.It is called reality because it is undeceiving in all aspects.290Pawo Rinpoche says:It is called “object” because one engages in the fundamental nature independence on the seeming and because it is what is to be strived for.It is “supreme” because it is essential for those who wish for liberationand undeceiving with respect to the result, which is Buddhahood.Thus, it is a term for [such] a common locus.291Painting the Sky: A Description of Their Defining CharacteristicsHere, the general definition of reality is “that which is undeceiving.” Thus, seem-ing reality is defined as that which is undeceiving on the seeming level. In Cen-trism, this refers to those phenomena that are found without analysis, that is,from the perspective of the false perception of ordinary sentient beings that is dis-torted by basic ignorance. In other words, these are all phenomena that are fab-ricated and superimposed through the reference points of imagination, speech,and expression. The Eighth Karmapa emphasizes that this seeming reality is nei-ther something separate from the basic ignorance that imagines it nor is it thisvery ignorance itself. Candrakırti says in his Entrance into Centrism:Since ignorance obscures its true nature, this is the seeming.The Sage has declared that seeming realityIs that which is fabricated and appears as real through this [ignorance].Thus, fabricated entities are the seeming.292To be more precise, seeming reality is characterized by afflicted ignorance.293This is the type of ignorance that is contained within the twelve links of depend-82The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 82"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"ent origination and is the cause of cyclic existence. One may wonder why theseeming is presented as a reality at all, since it is what appears from an intrinsi-cally distorted perspective. In general, it is just on the conventional level andprovisionally that Centrists speak of it as a reality in order to guide ordinarybeings. The first reason to present it as a reality is in terms of subjective experi-ence, because worldly people take seeming appearances to be really existing justas they appear. The second reason lies in worldly empiricism, because causes andresults appear to function in an unmistaken way from the perspective of provi-sional reasoning, that is, as long as the notions of cause and result themselves arenot questioned. However, seeming reality is clearly not an objective or stablereality, because it does not withstand analysis and because it does not appear asan object of the meditative equipoise of the noble ones.In general, ultimate reality is that which is ultimately undeceiving. In Centrism,this refers to that which is perceived through nonconceptual self-aware wisdomfrom the perspective of the perfect perception of noble ones in meditativeequipoise. Again, ultimate reality is in no way established as something that is dif-ferent or independent from the meditative equipoise of noble ones. There is alsono meditative equipoise of noble ones apart from this ultimate reality. Such med-itative equipoise is not to be understood as a perception of somethingor of just onesingle ultimate object, such as theemptiness or theultimate. Rather, it is morelike a simultaneous panoramic awareness of the true nature of all phenomena. Inthis, there is no duality of subject and object and no restriction through focusingon some particular object. As such, it is completely unfabricated. Thus, nonrefer-ential wisdom sees the nonreferential nature of phenomena beyond imaginationand expression. The way in which this wisdom sees is called “without seeing,”since it does not see in the same manner as ordinary beings do. It does not see any-thing as they perceive and label it. The Concise Prajñ›p›ra mit›sÒtra294says:Beings usually speak of “seeing the sky.”Examine this point of how you see the sky!The Buddha taught that the seeing of phenomena is just like this.In his Entrance into the Two Realities, AtıŸa agrees:In the very profound sÒtras,It is said that nonseeing is to see this.Here, there is no seeing and no seer,No beginning and no end, just peace.Entities and nonentities are left behind.It is nonconceptual and nonreferential.The Middle from Beginning to End 83Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 83"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":". . . It is inexpressible, unobservable,Unchanging, and unconditioned.When it is realized by yogins,Afflictive and cognitive obscurations are relinquished.295Jñ›nagarbha’s Distinction between the Two Realitiessays:It is not suitable to abideAs an entity corresponding to its appearance.It does not appear in any way whatsoeverFor any entity of consciousness.296His autocommentary explains:The ultimate does not abide as it appears, since it does not even appearfor the knowledge of the Omniscient One. Therefore, the sÒtras say:Not seeing anything at all is to see true reality.297Bh›vaviveka’s Heart of Centrismsays: Its character is neither existent, nor nonexistent,Nor [both] existent and nonexistent, nor neither.Centrists should know true realityThat is free from these four possibilities.298By definition, ultimate reality cannot be taught or demonstrated. As The SÒtraof Engaging in the Two Realities299says:Devaputra, ultimate reality cannot be taught. Why is that? Ulti-mately, all such phenomena as the one who teaches, what is taught,and the basis on which this is taught are utterly unborn. One is notable to explain utterly unborn phenomena through utterly unbornphenomena.Therefore, it is said that the ultimate cannot be an object of cognition. When theformations of mind or mental events merge with the ultimate, all of them are nat-urally and completely at peace, and none of them has any chance to stir for evena single moment. As ⁄›ntideva’s Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Lifesays:84The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 84"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The ultimate is not the sphere of cognition.It is said that cognition is the seeming.300Karmapa Mikyö Dorje explains that this mode of being is the vital point of thedefinitive meaning of all sÒtras and tantras and nothing other than the“Mah›mudr› of mental nonengagement that is beyond cognition” that was trans-mitted from Saraha and ⁄avaripa to Marpa and Milarepa.There is no contradiction between, first, the explanation that the ultimate istaken as the object of the wisdom of noble ones and, second, the teaching insome sÒtras and treatises that it is not the sphere of cognition. The ultimate canbe said to be seen by nonconceptual wisdom in terms of negative determina-tion:301The very fact that nothing whatsoever is to be seen is not seen as anythingat all. On the other hand, the ultimate is not seen in terms of any positive deter-mination,302that is, by any dualistic consciousness in the manner of a knowableobject and a subject that knows this object. This means that not seeing any ref-erence points is expressed as seeing their actual nature. It is similar to the fol-lowing example: Imagine some people who are in doubt as to whether they canwrite letters onto space or not. Through their not “seeing”—that is, their notfinding—any possibility of being able to write in this way, they “see” in the senseof understanding that they are not able to write in such a way. As in the case ofseeming reality, one might argue that such an ultimate reality cannot have the sta-tus of a reality on the grounds that it is not established as anything at all. Ulti-mately, that is true, but provisonally, ultimate reality is taught in order to guidesentient beings in accordance with the conventions of logic and reasoning.When not analyzed, seeming reality refers to the plain presence of mere appear-ances that can be satisfying only as long as they are left unquestioned. Whenslightly analyzed, seeming reality is just the assembly of interdependent causes andconditions. Since we engage in what is without any real nature through our con-ventions of thinking and expression, it is “mere nominality,” “mere convention-ality,” “mere imagination,” and “mere superimposition.” All these terms serve assynonyms for seeming reality. When thoroughly analyzed, all phenomena are inthemselves nothing but the complete primordial peace of reference points andcharacteristics. It is not that they become free from reference points through thevision of the noble ones, through reasoned analysis, or through emptiness. Thephenomena that are found from the perspective of a mind without analysis andwith slight analysis are called seeming reality. That which is “found” (in the man-ner of nonseeing) through thorough analysis and the meditative equipoise ofnoble ones is called ultimate reality or emptiness. It is also named suchness,because it never changes into anything else. It is “the true end,”303because it isseen as what is unmistaken.

It is “the expanse of dharmas,”The Middle from Beginning to End 85Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 85"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"because it is the cause for the dharma qualities of the noble ones.304In brief, the difference between seeming reality and ultimate reality is whethera perceived object is ultimately deceiving or undeceiving and whether the corre-sponding subject perceives this object in a way that is essentially mistaken orunmistaken. Thus, the main criterion for distinguishing the two realities lies in thedissimilar modes of perception of the minds of ordinary beings and noble ones. In general, seeming reality is not an object that is known or seen from the per-spective of nonconceptual wisdom minds, while ultimate reality is not an objectthat can be known from the perspective of mistaken minds. Thus, actually, thereis no common basis or ground for a division into two realities. However, TheTreasury of Knowledgesays that, from the perspective of no analysis, one maytake “just that which can be known” as the basis for distinguishing the two real-ities. As The SÒtra of the Meeting of Father and Son says:What can be known is nothing but just these two realities.In his commentary on The Ornament of Clear Realization, called The Noble OneResting at Ease, the Eighth Karmapa provisionally suggests “phenomena’s nature”as the basis for classifying the two realities. In this way, he distinguishes betweentwo types of nature: phenomena’s ultimate nature and their seeming nature.However, he also makes it very clear that this is just conventional verbiage:Here, this nature that is [called] “phenomena’s own nature” has to beclassified as the two realities. As for the ultimate, just in terms of con-venient conventional expressions, [one may say,] “All phenomena donot have a nature. Therefore, they are empty of nature. This is their[ultimate] nature or entity.” [In actual fact,] however, there are manypoints to be disputed and examined even with respect to this mere[statement]. As for the seeming—exemplified by something like a pil-lar—[the fact] that just this appearing aspect of a pillar possesses thefunction to support a beam and so on is presented as its [seeming]nature.305From the various perspectives of the individuals who are the knowers of whatcan be known, there are not only two realities. Strictly speaking, within seemingreality, there are as many realities as there are beings. In a sense, we all live in ourown world, since nobody has any experiences that are exactly the same as thoseof others. In Centrism, there is no such thing as collective experience that is reallyshared with others. However, that everybody has different experiences does notmean that there is some actual reality out there that exists independently of indi-vidual perceptions and is just seen in different ways. This understanding is not86The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 86"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"even uniquely Buddhist, as precisely the same is suggested by modern Westerncognitive science and biology, which, for example, gained many detailed insightsinto how differently various animals perceive what we call the world. How then could we define a general outer reality that is independent of indi-vidual perception? If we just go by majority vote, compared to the number of ani-mals and the many ways that they perceive “the world,” the reality thatcorresponds to our more or less “common” human perception is a hopeless can-didate. We have no basis for establishing our perception as more valid than orsuperior to other beings’. In fact, as science tells us, in one way or another, all ani-mals have much sharper senses than humans. So it is only our conceptual mindthat might entitle us to claim superiority or validity of cognition. According toBuddhism, however, conceptual mind is essentially mistaken in that it mixes upmental images with their seemingly real referents. In brief, the entirety of theinfinite realities of perceived objects and perceiving subjects within cyclic exis-tence is actually delusive.Take, for example, a person like Joseph Stalin, who was seen by many as a crueldictator and murderer. Others regarded him as a great politician and war hero.Still others may have perceived him as a friend, many as their enemy. His chil-dren saw him as their father, his wife as her husband, and his parents as theirchild. Mosquitos or tigers experienced him as a source of delicious food, the bac-teria in his body as their abode or universe, and his dog as its master. So whoamong them is “correct” about Mr. Stalin?Still, when Buddha ⁄›kyamuni appeared in this world and taught the dharma,he did so in a human body. Accordingly, he gave his instructions on the basis ofhuman perceptions and conceptions and thus presented the common humanway of seeing the world as conventionally real. It was only in comparison withthis human perspective that he presented other beings’ way of seeing as“unreal”—that is, unreal for human beings, but not from the conventional per-spective of these other beings themselves. Thus, from the human perspective,conventionally, a river is said to be real as water, and the eye consciousness thatperceives it as water is said to be undeceiving. Judging from this perspective,other ways of seeing this river, such as when it is said that hungry ghosts experi-ence it as a stream of pus and blood or gods as nectar, are then conventionallyunreal and deceiving. However, in no way does this mean that the human wayof seeing the world is per se any more real or better than the perspective of anyother being.As for ultimate reality, it is impossible to say whether the experiences of ulti-mate reality in the meditative equipoises of different noble beings are the sameor individually distinct, since it is the very nature of such meditative equipoise tobe free from all reference points. Thus, experientially, the question of being oneor many simply does not apply on this level. If different noble beings in medita-The Middle from Beginning to End 87Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 87"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"tive equipoise were to have exactly the same experience, it would absurdly followthat all these noble beings have one and the same mind. How then could therebe different noble beings in the first place? Moreover, if they have the same mind,either they would have to progress on the path simultaneously in exactly thesame way or, since they all experience in the same way—no matter whether theyare called arhats, bodhisattvas, or Buddhas—there would be no progressive stagesat all for different beings on the path. Conversely, if their experiences were dif-ferent, then there would be as many ultimate realities as there are noble beings.This would mean that the ultimate would be multiple and thus not be the ulti-mate or final nature of phenomena. Or, one might wonder which one of all thesemany ultimate realities actually is ultimate reality. In addition, this contradicts thenumerous statements that there is only a single ultimate reality.Are the Two Realities One or Different?What is the relationship between the two realities themselves? It is a highlydebated issue whether they are one or different. That this is not just academichairsplitting will be clear from what the Eighth Karmapa says below about howthis question applies to such expressions as “the equality of cyclic existence andnirv› ̊a” and “thoughts being the Dharma Body,” which serve as pith instructionsfor meditation practice.The classic scriptural reference for the two realities being neither one nor dif-ferent is The SÒtra That Unravels the Intention. This text lists four flaws thatwould follow if the two realities were one:1) Just as ordinary beings perceive seeming reality, they would see ultimate real-ity at the same time. Thus, while still ordinary beings, they would be liberatedwithout effort and achieve nirv› ̊a or Buddhahood.2) The defining characteristics of seeming reality and ultimate reality would bemutually inclusive. From this, it would follow that, for example, the emptinessof a desirable object is also an object of desire and thus a cause for sufferingrather than its remedy.3) Just as there is no diversity in the ultimate nature of all conditioned phenom-ena of seeming reality, there would be no diversity among conditioned phe-nomena.4) Yogic practitioners would not have to seek for an ultimate reality beyond con-ditioned entities as they appear to the senses or as they are conceived by thethinking mind. If the two realities were different, this would entail the following four flaws:88The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 88"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"1) Those who see ultimate reality would not be liberated from cyclic existence,since the experience of seeming reality would be completely unaffected by see-ing ultimate reality. Thus, they would not achieve nirv› ̊a or Buddhahood.2) Ultimate reality would not be the true nature of the conditioned entities ofseeming reality, just as a vase is not the true nature of a piece of cloth.3) The mere identitylessness or lack of nature of conditioned entities would notbe their ultimate character, since these two are completely unrelated.4) Afflicted phenomena and purified phenomena—in other words, mental statesof basic ignorance with their delusive appearances and the nonconceptual wis-dom that realizes emptiness—would simultaneously exist within the continuaof noble beings, such as Buddhas, since realizing emptiness would not haveeliminated ignorance.306The Treasury of Knowledgesays that, conventionally and without further analy-sis, the two realities may be said to be one in nature but different isolates.307Thismeans that their nature is one but they appear as something different for theconceptual mind. Ultimately, they are inexpressible as “one” or “different.” PawoRinpoche states that all presentations of the two realities as being one or differ-ent—whether in terms of nature or isolates—cannot but be construed in a waythat is tied down to the conventions of dialectics. Centrism, however, does notpresent these conventional terms (such as “isolates”) as parts of a system of itsown. Moreover, he quotes the concluding verse from the previously cited chap-ter of The SÒtra That Unravels the Intention:The defining characteristic of the conditioned realms and the ultimateIs their defining characteristic of freedom from being one and different.Those who think of them in terms of oneness and differenceHave not mentally engaged them in a proper way.Thus, the Buddha declared that it is an improper approach to conceptualizephenomena that are free from being one or different as being one or different.Karmapa Mikyö Dorje and Padma Karpo agree in that the two realities are noteven conventionally one or different. The Karmapa argues that the question ofbeing one or different can only apply to the level of common worldly consensusthat presupposes really existing things. In general, if things really exist, they canonly exist in such a way that they are either one or different. Otherwise, they sim-ply do not exist at all. In the Centrist system, however, just like all other phe-nomena, the two realities are not conceived or expressed as something that reallyexists. Thus, how could Centrists think of them as one or different?When seen from the perspective of the minds of ordinary beings, the two real-ities are not one either, because ultimate reality does not appear for these beings.The Middle from Beginning to End 89Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 89"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"They are also not different, because ordinary beings do not perceive two distinctrealities. Furthermore, they cannot be expressed as being the same or different,since they are mutually dependent: They are delusive as opposed to undelusive.In general, what depends on something else cannot be the same as what itdepends on, because it is contradictory for one thing to be both that whichdepends on something and that on which it depends. What is mutually depend-ent also cannot be different: If a phenomenon is dependent on something else,this is precisely the fact that makes it something that is not established on itsown or by itself in the first place. Since this one phenomenon is not findable onits own, there is nothing that could be different from its counterpart or anythingelse. Thus, there is not even something to depend on something other. On theother hand, if what is dependent on something other is established in itself, thereis no possibility that it is—and also no need for it to be—dependent on anythingelse.Also, when seen from the perspective of the meditative equipoise of nobleones, the two realities are not one either, because the diversity of seeming realitydoes not appear in such equipoise. They are also not different, because the nobleones in meditative equipoise do not perceive two distinct realities. If they wereto perceive seeming reality too, this would mean that they would have the appear-ance of something that they would take to be not empty. Thus, they would notbe free from the characteristics of conditioned phenomena and the bondage ofclinging to them. However, without release from these, the state of a noble being,nirv› ̊a, and Buddhahood are completely impossible. Thus, if the two realities donot even appear as two in the meditative equipoise of noble ones, what point isthere in talking about their hypothetical attributes, such as their being one or dif-ferent? The two realities are also not contradictory or mutually exclusive in the sensethat the more powerful one of them is able to obstruct or cancel out the other,thus rendering it powerless. They are not two separately existing entities and alsonot just two ways of seeing the same thing. Rather, seeming reality appears onlyin the mistaken minds of ordinary beings and does not appear from the per-spective of wisdom. The opposite is true for ultimate reality. Thus, it is not thattwo contradictory phenomena or realities interfere with each other in a singlelocation or mind. This is just as there is no mutual perceptual or object-relatedinterference between the existence of, for example, purple mice for a certain per-son who is drunk and the nonexistence of such mice for everybody else.When we look at this from the point of view of a single object, it becomes obvi-ous that the two realities are neither the same nor different. For example, a tableis not its emptiness, and the table’s emptiness is not the table. Otherwise, seeingthe table with one’s visual consciousness would mean seeing emptiness. Or, itwould follow that noble ones in meditative equipoise still see tables and the like90The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 90"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"when resting in the realization of emptiness. There is also no common locus fora table and its emptiness; that is, there isn’t something that is both. On the otherhand, one cannot extract a table’s emptiness from the table, put it right next tothe table, and perceive two distinct objects. Nor can the table’s emptiness befound as something different within the table itself. The same principle appliesto all ordinary phenomena. The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentiongives manyexamples of this, such as that we cannot separate pepper and its hotness or goldand its color. Likewise, we would not say that the hotness of pepper is the pep-per or that the color of a piece of gold is that piece of gold.In terms of Buddhist practice, Karmapa Mikyö Dorje emphasizes that suchstatements in the Kagyü lineage as “Thoughts are the Dharma Body,” “Sa ̇s›rais nirv› ̊a,” and “Afflictions are wisdom” are taught with the intention that, ulti-mately, the two realities do not exist as different things. However, such phrasesare not meant to establish that thoughts and the Dharma Body, sa ̇s›ra andnirv› ̊a, and so on are one in nature with the understanding that the two com-ponents of such pairs are two actual and distinct entities or realities. The reasonfor this is as follows: To negate that thoughts and the Dharma Body, and so on,are ultimately different implies also the negation that they are one in nature. Thismeans that if there are no two actually existing and distinct phenomena to havea connection with each other in the first place, one cannot establish a connectionof oneness in nature between such nonexistents. As Gampopa says:Make firm your resolveThat this connate consciousness is wisdom. Once you gain certainty about this, you see true reality.Make firm your resolveThat these thoughts that emerge from the mindAre the ultimate.Once you experience this, you see your heart.Make firm your resolveThat these imputed tendencies that appear and resoundAre the Dharma Body.Once you attain realization of this, you see what is real.308 Pamo Truba declares:The waves of affliction and clinging to a selfAre the wisdom of the Buddhas of the three times.The darkness of thoughts and ignoranceThe Middle from Beginning to End 91Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 91"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Is great luminosity free from discursiveness.The blaze of the three poisons of the afflictionsIs the wisdom mandala of the Victors.309Such statements may indeed sound as if the two realities—thoughts and theDharma Body, and so on—were one in nature. However, only those who havethe tendency to solidify and reify everything can take the two realities, sa ̇s›raand nirv› ̊a, thoughts and the Dharma Body, and such to be real entities andthen label them good or bad, high or low, and so on. The above quotationsmerely indicate that all phenomena are equal in that they have not even theslightest nature of their own. They all have the same mode of being, which is thatthey are without nature and are just suchness in which there is no difference orotherness. Thus, these teachings do not say that a sa ̇s›ra and a nirv› ̊a thatexist separately as actual things are one in nature. Moreover, this very same expres-sion that all phenomena are one or equal in that they are without nature is usedover and over in the Buddha’s own words that teach the profound definitivemeaning, such as the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras. The Jewel Casket SÒtra310says:There is not the slightest difference to be made between afflictionsand Buddha qualities.The Great Drum SÒtra311agrees:Mind and enlightenmentAre not seen as two.What is the defining characteristic of enlightenmentIs also the defining characteristic of mind.That such statements have to be taken literally is made clear in the system ofN›g›rjuna, who was prophesied by the Buddha as the one who would elucidatethe definitive meaning of Madhyamaka.

On the other hand, once those who arethe fully qualified recipients of such teachings realize the actual meaning of theseexplicit words, they will be released from all thoughts that the two realities are oneor different in terms of an actual nature. The reason for this is that the meaningof the dharma cannot be understood through reliance on mere words. Rather,teaching and practicing the dharma always have to be grounded in the fourreliances.313Thus, there is no way that people with a proper understanding couldmistake the explicit words of teachings such as Gampopa’s Answers to the Ques-tions of Tüsum Khyenba:Connate mind as such is the Dharma Body.Connate appearances are the light of the Dharma Body.314Tragba Gyaltsen315(1147–1216), the third supreme head of the Sakya school, putsthis even more dramatically:The hells’ ground of burning ironIs the Akani ̋ ̨ha of true reality.The fiery suffering of heat and coldIs the Dharma Body free from discursiveness.The views of non-Buddhist forders316Are the Madhyamaka of true reality.317The Seven Points of Mind Training, transmitted from AtıŸa and the Kadampa lin-eage in all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism, says:Seeing delusion as the four enlightened Bodies is the unsurpassableprotection through emptiness.318As for the unity of the two realities, Padma Karpo’s Illumination of Three Cen-trist Scriptural Systemssays:From the perspective of the basic nature, . . . the nature of phenom-ena, the fundamental nature or [just] the nature, nothing can beposited as anything. Therefore, this [actuality] is labeled “emptiness,”“lack of nature,” or “dependent origination.” Since this is not estab-lished as anything whatsoever, it is suitable that anything emerges fromit. If it were established as any [real] nature, since it is impossible forThe Middle from Beginning to End 93Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 93"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"a [real] nature to change into something other, it would not be suit-able that something other than this [real nature] appears, just as char-coal does not turn white [even] if it is washed with milk. Whateverappears from the aspect of phenomenal expression does not affect [thisultimate] nature, just as space [seems to] fluctuate in various ways,such as clouds, dusty winds, sunlight, darkness, and moonlight. There-fore, we have the twofold classification into the ultimate when look-ing at the unchanging fundamental nature and into the seeming whenlooking at the fluctuations of [its] radiance. Since both parts of such aclassification are of the same taste in that they have the nature of lack-ing any nature, nobody is able to distinguish them as something dif-ferent. Therefore, they are called “inseparable” or a “unity,” very muchlike ice and water. Thus, one should understand that, just as groundand fruition are not discerned as two, ground and path as well as pathand fruition are inseparable.319Just as water is the inseparable nature of ice, ultimate reality is the nature ofseeming reality. They are neither the same nor different. Needing to quenchone’s thirst in the midst of a glacier, one would not discard the ice and search forwater elsewhere. One would need only to melt the ice. In the same way, we donot have to dump seeming reality and import ultimate reality from somewhereelse beyond our world. Rather, it is only through realizing the unity of the tworealities that the icy glaciers of seeming reality can melt into the soothing watersof ultimate reality. At the same time, this unity is the unity of appearance andemptiness and the unity of wisdom and emptiness.Seeming Divisions of the SeemingSeeming Reality and Mere SeemingTo account for the difference between what appears to ordinary beings and to thenoble ones in subsequent attainment, Candrakırti’s autocommentary onTheEntrance into Centrism distinguishes between “seeming reality” and the “mereseeming” among seeming appearances in general.320As explained earlier, the firstis what appears for ordinary beings in whose minds the ignorance of clinging toreal existence has not dissolved. This is not the same as what appears during thesubsequent attainment of noble ones in whose minds such ignorance has sub-sided. Thus, what appears for them during this phase is called the “mere seeming.”From the perspective of a Buddha, seeming phenomena do not appear underany circumstances. As far as ordinary beings and other noble beings such asbodhisattvas are concerned, it is in terms of whether they are affected by afflictedor unafflicted ignorance that the Buddha spoke about “seeming reality” and the94The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 94"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"“mere seeming.” Unafflicted ignorance is an equivalent for the cognitive obscu-rations, that is, the latent tendencies of clinging to reality plus the clinging to thefact that phenomena lack reality and are illusionlike. Since the noble ones areaffected only by this unafflicted type of ignorance, for them there is just a mereappearance of delusive phenomena—the “mere seeming”—which is a naturaloccurrence on their paths. Such mere seeming appearances emerge only duringthe states of subsequent attainment of the noble ones, but not during their med-itative equipoise. For them, all that is perceived as real and solid through theclinging of ordinary beings is not real, because they perceive no such real phe-nomena in meditative equipoise and are fully and instantaneously aware thateverything that appears to them during subsequent attainment is delusive, like anillusion or a reflection. Such appearances are deceiving for ordinary beings, butfor the noble ones they are mere fictions that originate in dependence upon fic-titious causes and conditions. Thus, what is seen by them under the influence ofunafflicted ignorance is not considered seeming reality but the mere seeming.The actual nature of this mere seeming—emptiness—is the ultimate that isseen from the perspective of the meditative equipoise of noble ones. Buddhas donot see the undeceiving ultimate as anything else, but the clinging of ordinarybeings observes nothing but the deceiving phenomena of seeming reality. Sinceboth afflicted and unafflicted ignorance—the causes for seeming reality and themere seeming—have ceased in Buddhas, the results of these causes—seemingappearances—have subsided too.Worldly Seeming and Yogic SeemingThe “worldly seeming” refers to the sphere of so-called common worldly people.From the Buddhist point of view, these are of two kinds: average individualswho are not engaged in philosophical systems and non-Buddhists who areengaged in various philosophical systems. Thus, the worldly seeming encom-passes both the seeming reality of ordinary beings as described above plus therealms of various non-Buddhist philosophical and scientific theories.As for Buddhist yogic practitioners, there are many types, as classified by thefour Buddhist philosophical systems, the five paths, or the ten grounds of bodhi-sattvas. The “yogic seeming” ranges from what is found through conventionalcognitions from the perspective of slight analysis, such as subtle impermanence,up through the appearances and realizations during the subsequent attainment ofnoble hearers, solitary realizers, and bodhisattvas. In particular, for Centrists, theyogic seeming begins with a conceptual understanding of emptiness that comesfrom studying and continues with more experiential insights through reflectionand analytical meditation. Finally, there is the true realization of the nature ofphenomena, which arises in nonconceptual and nondualistic meditativeequipoise. Thus, the Centrist yogic seeming does not refer only to the realizationsThe Middle from Beginning to End 95Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 95"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"of advanced practitioners; it encompasses all levels of relating to and practicingthe Centrist teachings on emptiness. This yogic seeming is also designated as “theanalytic seeming,” “the seeming connected to a reasoning consciousness of nobleones,” and “the Centrist seeming.” The way in which the yogic seeming is com-municated is partly by conventions about which there is already immediate com-mon worldly consensus. To account for the particulars of the Buddhist path,yogic practitioners also rely on the conventions in the words of the Buddha thatmay serve as a basis for common consensus among them, such as the causes andresults of cyclic existence and liberation, the presentations of grounds and paths,the mental factors to be relinquished and their remedies, and the specific ways inwhich meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment appear.Correct and False SeemingThis distinction pertains only to what appears to ordinary beings. Here, Centristsdifferentiate between perceptions that are based on unaffected and affected sensefaculties. The Entrance into Centrismsays:False seeing is asserted to be twofold:[Perceptions through] clear sense faculties and defective sense faculties.The consciousnesses of those with defective sense facultiesAre asserted as false in comparison to consciousnesses based onsound sense faculties.What is apprehended by the six undamaged sense facultiesIs what the world cognizes.This is real in terms of the world.The rest is presented as false in terms of the world.321AtıŸa’s Entrance into the Two Realitiesstates:The seeming is asserted as twofold:The false one and the correct one.The first is twofold: [appearances such as floating] hairs or [double] moonsAs well as the conceptions of inferior philosophical systems.These arising and ceasing phenomena,Only satisfying when not examinedAnd being able to perform functions,Are asserted as the correct seeming.322As these verses indicate, the distinction between correct perception and false96The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 96"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"perception within the seeming is made only from the perspective of ordinarybeings. From the perspective of the wisdom of noble ones and Centrist reason-ing, illusory cows and “actual” cows are equally unreal or delusive. This wasdemonstrated by Candrakırti in a very practical manner when he drew a pictureof a cow on a wall, milked it, and thus produced “actual milk” from this drawncow. On another occasion, he bumped into a pillar at N›land› University. Thiscaused great laughter among his friends, who said, “Hey, you just ran into thatpillar—what happened to your view of emptiness?” Candrakırti just waved hishand through the pillar and answered, “Which pillar?” There is no doubt thatCentrists deny any reliable criteria or valid cognitions to establish something ascorrect and something other as false among seeming appearances. It is only toreflect common worldly consensus that they call perceptions that result fromunaffected sense faculties “correct.” What is perceived through unaffected sensefaculties is real for worldly beings, since, from their perspective, it appears as real,they cling to it as real, and it is conventionally undeceiving. Thus, it is only incomparison to such worldly “correctness” that other perceptions that result fromaffected sense faculties are called “false.” The same applies to the respective objectsof such perceptions. However, as is said in the above quotations, both correct andfalse seeming are just two varieties of false seeing and its objects.What is perceived through affected sense faculties is considered to be false ornonexistent even by worldly beings based on their notions of what is correct per-ception. Thus, it is not even a part of seeming reality, let alone any ultimate exis-tence. Here, a distinction is made between inner and outer conditions that affectthe sense faculties and result in mistaken perceptions. Inner conditions for mis-takenness are, for example, blurred vision due to cataracts, or perceptual distor-tions from taking drugs. Outer conditions include the causes of a mirage or anecho. In Buddhism, “sense faculties” include the nonphysical “mental sense fac-ulty,” which is basically the moment of consciousness that immediately precedesand triggers the next moment of consciousness. This is seen as the sense facultyof the mental consciousness as opposed to the sense consciousnesses. When it isaffected, for example, by the condition of sleep, this results in dream experiences.In the waking state, the main condition for the mistakenness of the mental con-sciousness consists in flawed inferential cognitions. These are based either oneveryday wrong views, such as believing in really existing outer objects, or on thewrong views that are established by various Buddhist and non-Buddhist realistsin their philosophical systems, such as an eternal self, a primal cosmic substance,or infinitesimal particles. Such notions are not found or used within ordinaryworldly consensus and thus not considered as the correct seeming.Centrists compare those who entertain such kinds of views with people whohave no natural skill at climbing trees but attempt it by letting go of the tree’slower branches and simultaneously reaching for its higher branches. In this way,The Middle from Beginning to End 97Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 97"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"rather than getting higher up, they just fall through the space between thebranches and crash to the ground. In the same way, through their intention tofind true reality, realists of all kinds try to go beyond worldly conventions but donot realize actual reality. Rather, they fall into the extremes of permanence andextinction that lie in between. Therefore, they deviate from both realities. TheEntrance into Centrismexplains:Those who are outside the path of venerable noble N›g›rjunaDo not possess the means for peace.They deviate from [both] seeming reality and true reality.Since they deviate from the two realities, there is no liberation to beaccomplished.323In his autocommentary, Candrakırti says that what is cognized by affectedsense faculties, such as a hallucination, does not fall under the category of seem-ing reality. Again, seeming reality is understood as only that which is taken to bereal by ordinary sentient beings, since the criteria for what is seemingly real aregeneral worldly perception and consensus. There is no worldly consensus thatappearances such as illusions or mirages perform the same functions as ordinarythings. Likewise, the imputations of philosophers do not serve as bases for ourconventional everyday transactions. The mere fact that some persons perceivesomething that nobody else perceives, or that they have their own private notionsabout things that are not shared by others, does not turn these into “seemingrealities.” Rather, on the mere conventional level, they are invalidated through theperceptions and ideas that most other people have and that serve as the bases fortheir everyday transactions. Therefore, such “private” appearances and notions arecalled the “false seeming.” However, this does not constitute a third reality besidesseeming reality and ultimate reality nor a third category of existents, since suchappearances are not real or existent for either ordinary beings with unaffectedsense faculties or noble ones.The way in which this distinction between “correct” and “false” is presentedshows clearly that it is again not something that is asserted by the Centrists them-selves. The Eighth Karmapa mentions the view of certain Tibetan doxographerswho say that one of the features that distinguishes Autonomists and Conse-quentialists is that the Autonomists assert this distinction between correct andfalse within seeming reality, while the Consequentialists do not assert it. Thereare also some people who say that this distinction exists as part of the Conse-quentialists’ own system too. Finally, there are those who say that it does noteven conventionally exist in the Consequentialist system. However, all of thesepositions are unjustified for the following reasons.

Therefore, what need is there to mentionwhether there is such a distinction in the Consequentialists’ own system? On theother hand, if this classification as correct or false in terms of common worldlyconsensus were not even presented on the conventional level, this would contra-dict verses VI.24 and VI.25 from Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrism cited above.Like Consequentialists, Autonomists also make this distinction not as part oftheir own system but only in accordance with common worldly consensus. Thisis clearly expressed by Autonomist masters such as Bh›vaviveka, Jñ›nagarbha,and ⁄›ntarak ̋ita.324To summarize, in their own context, seeming appearances in general may bedifferentiated as follows: “Seeming reality” or the “correct seeming” is only thatwhich is correctly perceived and labeled by ordinary beings according to theirstandards of correct and false. What is wrongly perceived or labeled according tothese standards is the “false seeming.” The illusionlike appearances during thesubsequent attainment of noble ones are the “mere seeming.” Thus, both thefalse seeming and the mere seeming are mere seeming appearances, but they donot fall under the category of seeming reality. The false seeming is not consideredto be real even by ordinary beings, whereas the way in which noble ones perceivethe mere seeming as unreal has nothing in common with the way that ordinarybeings perceive. Furthermore, to distinguish between the sphere of all non-Bud-dhists—whether engaged in any philosophical systems or not—and the specificpractices, experiences, and realizations on the various Buddhist paths, one speaksabout the “worldly seeming” and the “yogic seeming.”However, none of these distinctions is to be taken as a hard-and-fast categorythat is established in any way or more real than the others. Rather, all of them aremerely descriptive, much as when one describes different appearances in a dream.From the perspective of the waking state, there is not the slightest difference interms of their reality between the appearances of a mirage and water in a dream.Hence, all conventional classifications and descriptions of seeming appearancesshould not make us forget that all such appearances, from ordinary forms upthrough a Buddha’s omniscience, are just illusionlike. As the Prajñ›p›ramit›sÒtrassay:I declare that all phenomena including nirv› ̊a—and even if therewere any phenomenon more supreme than that—are illusionlike anddreamlike.325Dividing Space: Divisions of the UltimateOf course, there can be no divisions of the actual nature of the ultimate.

On the subject side, it is a rea-soning consciousness about emptiness that fulfills the criteria of inferential validcognition. On the object side, it is the emptiness that is characterized as a non-implicative negation. Such can be regarded as a reality, since it is undeceivingfrom the perspective of analytical reasoning. It is, however, only a partial freedomfrom reference points. For example, the nonimplicative negation “nonarising”that negates arising still involves the notion of nonarising. As ⁄›ntideva says,such notions must be let go too:Through familiarity with the latent tendencies of emptiness,The latent tendencies of entities will be relinquished.Through familiarity with “utter nonexistence,”These too will be relinquished later on.Once neither entities nor nonentitiesRemain before the mind,There is no other mental flux [either].Therefore, it is utter nonreferential peace.326The actual and complete freedom from all reference points, such as arising,nonarising, existence, and nonexistence, is called nonnominal ultimate reality.The Treasury of Knowledgereminds us to be aware that all the various avenues ofanalyzing the two realities in Centrist treatises are solely dealing with nominalultimate reality. Actual ultimate reality is by definition completely inaccessible toany conceptual analysis.327In terms of the object to be negated, nominal ultimate reality is further clas-sified as personal identitylessness and phenomenal identitylessness.328In terms ofdefining characteristics, it can be divided into the three “doors to liberation”:emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness329(sometimes a fourth door, nonappli-cation,330is added). Among these, it is emptiness in particular that is further clas-sified in various ways in different scriptures.331In conclusion, one may wonder whether the phenomena that are contained inthe two realities exist as knowable objects. In terms of the Centrists’ own system,when such phenomena are analyzed and not found, obviously this question ispointless. And when Centrists talk about these phenomena without analysis, theydo not describe them in such a way as to say that certain ones among them existas correct knowable objects and certain others do not. However, when speakingabout phenomena in adaptation to the common worldly consensus of others,without analysis, Centrists in general say that all phenomena contained in the two100The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 100"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"realities are suitable to be known as mental objects. As for those Centrists whoare beyond worldly experiences, in order to guide disciples and without analysis,they just repeat what is the common worldly consensus of those who say thatknowable objects accord with dependent origination and are illusionlike. Again,it is only from the perspective of such people that these Centrists say this. As forthe illusionlike “mere seeming” that originates under the influence of unafflictedignorance (the phenomena included in that aspect of the seeming which is theconsensus of noble ones within the context of the presentation of the two reali-ties as just something mutually dependent), these Centrists would say that, con-ventionally, the phenomena of this mere seeming correctly exist as knowableobjects. All other phenomena do not exist as correct knowable objects of unmis-takenness. They include all phenomena of seeming reality that originate from andare affected by afflicted ignorance as well as all appearances and ideas of those whoare affected by incidental causes for mistakenness, such as visual objects for peo-ple with blurred vision or notions about a permanent self.A Critical Analysis of Some Other Tibetan Views on the Two Realities in CentrismOther Tibetan masters, such as Tsongkhapa and his followers, give the follow-ing definitions of the two realities. The definition of seeming reality is “what isfound through conventional valid cognition” or “what is found from the per-spective of conventional consciousness without examination.” The definition ofultimate reality is “what is found through the valid cognition of a reasoning con-sciousness” or “what is found from the perspective of the final reasoning con-sciousness.” Through such definitions, they claim to represent the intention ofthe well-known verse from The Entrance into Centrism:It is through the perfect and the false seeing of all entitiesThat the entities that are thus found bear two natures.The object of perfect seeing is true reality,And false seeing is the seeming reality.332To analyze the phrase “the perspective of conventional consciousness withoutexamination” in the above definition of seeming reality, Pawo Rinpoche askswhether “examination” refers to a thorough and precise examination of things orjust to their superficial examination by distinguishing them through labels andnames. If it means thorough examination, then any kind of precise analytical reflec-tion and its findings—such as reflecting on subtle atomic particles and finding thatthey do not exist—would not belong to seeming reality. If “examination” refers tothe second option, then mere labeling consciousnesses and what is labeled by themThe Middle from Beginning to End 101Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 101"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"would not be included in seeming reality. Furthermore, does the term “conven-tional” here refer to the cognitive mode of a consciousness that conceives of andworks with conventions or to the mere fact that something is a convention? In thefirst case, consciousness during deep sleep and while fainting as well as in the med-itative absorption without discrimination333would not be included in seeming real-ity. In the second case, it would follow that ultimate reality too is seeming reality.As for the phrase “what is found from the perspective of the final reasoningconsciousness,” it just exposes clinging to the positions of realists. The reason is asfollows: All that seems to appear as form and such is nothing but delusive appear-ance, or various dependently originating assemblages. Our mental grasping takesthese fleeting phenomena as existing in just the way they appear. In accordancewith such clinging and under the influence of certain causes and conditions, anensuing subjective consciousness of them appears. In this way, our fundamentalerror lies precisely in mistaking this process for “having found something.” How-ever, a hypothetical something that is found through Centrist reasoning isabsolutely impossible. Consequently, something that is not found—as the coun-terpart of what is found—cannot be set up through Centrist reasoning either.So the actual clinging to phenomenal identity is precisely this belief of naïvebeings that they find an object through a subject—that is, consciousness—thatcognizes it. In order to dissolve such grasping, identitylessness is taught by meansof the two realities. Pawo Rinpoche concludes that to use phrases such as “what isfound from the perspective of consciousness” in the definitions of the two realitieseven with regard to the actual ultimate, that is, when it is necessary to remove allclinging to something that can be found, just shows one’s lack of confidence inemptiness. In particular, a phenomenon “that is found from the perspective of thefinal reasoning consciousness” is utterly impossible, since the Buddha himself said:Abiding in the heart of enlightenment, I do not fathom any phenom-enon whatsoever.The people who use the above definitions might say then, “Granted, it isimpossible to find something from the perspective of final reasoning. Neverthe-less, we label precisely the fact of not finding anything as ‘the ultimate.’” Froma certain point of view, it may be fine to formulate the definition of the ultimateas “not finding anything from the perspective of reasoning,” but when one wantsto explain that there is nothingto be found, what is the point of still using thewords “what is found” in the above definition of ultimate reality? In actual fact,however, how could “not finding anything” be the ultimate, since “finding some-thing” and “not finding anything” are nothing but reference points, and it isasserted that the ultimate is freedom from reference points? Furthermore, phrasessuch as “what is found through conventional valid cognition” and “objects of a102The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 102"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"perception that is aware of outer referents” are just drawn from the conventionsof dialectics. In the context of Centrism, they are completely out of place. AsThe Entrance into the Two Realitiesclearly says:Perceptual and inferential cognition—These two are accepted by Buddhists.Only narrow-minded fools sayThat emptiness is realized by these two.andPerceptual and inferential cognition are useless.It is just for the sake of refuting non-Buddhist opponentsThat the learned ones have promoted them.The learned master Bhavya saidThat the scriptures are clear about[The ultimate] being realized neither throughConceptual nor nonconceptual consciousnesses.334Some people might still argue, “In Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrism, theline `the entities that are thus found bear two natures’335teaches that somethingis found from the perspective of reasoning.” The verse that contains this lineteaches only that there are two modes of apprehending the vast variety of all enti-ties: perfect seeing and false seeing. However, it does not teach that something isfound from the perspective of reasoning or consciousness.In general, there are many positions on ultimate reality, such as asserting it as anonimplicative negation, saying that it is an implicative negation, or stating it in anaffirmative way as something permanent and stable. However, each of these pre-sentations implies a certain purpose. For example, in a certain situation, the ultimatemay be explained as a nonimplicative negation in order to remove an opponent’sclinging to it being established in a certain way. In another situation, it may beexplained as an implicative negation in order to dispel the clinging to it being a non-implicative negation. At other times, it may also be described as something per-manent and stable that is not empty of qualities in order to remedy the clinging thatthe ultimate is just a nonexistent. Hence, it should be clear that all these explana-tions do not really contradict each other. However, if they are propounded in anyway that involves clinging to them, they are a far cry from the ultimate, for a nega-tion is just an imputation by a mind that clings to nonexistence, and an affirma-tion is an imputation by a mind that clings to existence. In the light of the actualnature of phenomena, all clinging—no matter to what—is simply mistaken.“Nonimplicative negation” is just a technical term used in the explanations ofThe Middle from Beginning to End 103Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 103"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"philosophical systems. It does not refer to anything other than what ordinaryworldly people understand by nonexistence. Therefore, if the ultimate were anonimplicative negation, in terms of the dichotomous categories of existence andnonexistence, it would mean nonexistence. If it were an implicative negation, orsomething affirmative in the sense of a permanent and stable ultimate, then interms of the dichotomous categories of existence and nonexistence, it wouldmean existence. However, it is obvious that neither the category of existence northat of nonexistence applies to the ultimate. Nor can the ultimate be both an exis-tent and a nonexistent. Clinging to existence is the view of permanence, andclinging to nonexistence is the view of extinction. Those who look at phenom-ena as existent or nonexistent do not see the utter peace that is actually to belooked at. The Buddha himself said that to have views in terms of entities ornonentities means not to see the true reality in his teaching. Moreover, the Bud-dha has refuted existence, nonexistence, and both again and again. When ana-lyzed, afflicted seeming appearances are not established either as existent or asnonexistent. Hence, this is all the more the case for the ultimate. In addition, nomatter whether the seeming is believed to exist by its nature or to not exist at all,in neither case could it be relinquished. As for the ultimate, it cannot be eitheran entity or a nonentity, since both entities and nonentities are conditioned inthe sense of being mentally imputed and mutually dependent. Consequently, ifthe ultimate were an entity or a nonentity, it would follow that it too was con-ditioned. This is clearly stated in N›g›rjuna’sFundamental Verses:How could nirv› ̊a beBoth an entity and a nonentity?Nirv› ̊a is unconditioned.Entities and nonentities are conditioned.336The Buddhas—whether they abide in front of us or have passed into nirv› ̊a—do not abide in any of the four extremes of existence, nonexistence, both, or nei-ther. Existence and nonexistence are nothing but extremes, and any clinging toeither of them is just a mental state of entertaining fancies. However, from theperspective of seeing actual reality, no fancies are at work.Still, Pawo Rinpoche says, there are some commentaries by later Tibetans(such as Tsongkhapa and his followers) who cannot accept that the seeming is notsomething that exists by its nature. Thus, they keep saying that “the seeming isnot nonexistent, while the ultimate is not existent” and that a particular phe-nomenon “is not nonexistent on the seeming level, while it is not existent on theultimate level.” Such tortuous statements come down to nothing but the wrongview that the mistaken appearances of the seeming exist by their nature and thatthe ultimate is nothing whatsoever, just like the horns of a rabbit.104The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 104"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Others are afraid of emptiness as the state in which all discursiveness and ref-erence points are at utter peace and think that something ultimate must defi-nitely be established. Hence, they express their clinging to some establishedultimate reality by claiming the opposite of the above: that “the seeming is notexistent, while the ultimate is not nonexistent.” Pawo Rinpoche compares themto people who insist that medicine has to be mixed with poison before it can beadministered. He says that if such ways of explanation were suitable, they wouldbe readily accepted by non-Buddhist schools too. For example, materialistic hedo-nists could then well say, “Former and later lifetimes are not existent, while thepresent personal self is not nonexistent.” Others would say, “Buddhist liberationis not existent, while it is not the case that liberation is nonexistent for non-Bud-dhists.” All these positions would be just as suitable as saying, “The seeming isnot existent, while the ultimate is not nonexistent.”The Definite Number of Two Realities and the Purpose of Understanding ThemAs explained earlier, the main purpose for distinguishing the two realities is pri-marily soteriological. This is also the criterion that determines their number. Inthis vein, seeming or conventional reality is presented in order to teach the accu-mulation of merit. What results from this is the accumulation of wisdom, therealization of ultimate reality free from conventions. Thus, since enlightenmentdepends on the gathering of these two accumulations, the realities are presentedas two in number. The Fundamental Versessays:Those who do not understandThe division of these two realitiesDo not understand the profound true realityOf the Buddha’s teaching.Without reliance on conventions,The ultimate cannot be taught.Without realization of the ultimate,Nirv› ̊a will not be attained.337firyadeva’sFour Hundred Verses on the Yogic Practice of Bodhisattvasstates:First, one should explainWhatever is pleasant to specific people.There is no way that someone who is repelledCan be a suitable receptacle for the genuine dharma.The Middle from Beginning to End 105Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 105"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Just as barbarians cannot understandThrough any other language [than their own],So the world cannot understandExcept through the worldly.338The Entrance into Centrismsays:Conventional reality is what serves as the means.Ultimate reality is what results from the means.339This also indicates the benefit of comprehending and working with the tworealities. If one does not understand them and their relationship, the true natureof phenomena will not be realized. On the other hand, if one understands the tworealities, there will be no confusion about the unmistaken meaning of the teach-ings of the Buddha. Through being skilled in understanding and working withthe display of seeming reality, one will be fully aware of the aspect of means—thatis, all the points that are to be adopted or rejected for the sake of liberation—andwill practice them accordingly. Through realizing ultimate reality, one will pro-ceed to the great “nonabiding nirv› ̊a” that is both naturally pure and pure of alladventitious stains. The Treasury of Knowledgequotes early Tibetan masters:Through appearances, one does not reject the path of karma.Through their being empty, clinging does not arise.The unity of the two realities is the middle path.340Other people give different reasons that the two realities are definitely two innumber. They say that this is because there are definitely two kinds of objects(those that withstand analysis and those that do not). Furthermore, they relate thetwo realities to two types of cognition (mistaken and unmistaken) or two typesof persons (those in cyclic existence and those in nirv› ̊a). However, somethingthat withstands final Centrist analysis is impossible. That which withstands tem-porary analysis is called the “worldly and yogic correct seeming,” but only incomparison with the false seeming. However, since the two Form Bodies alsobelong to the correct seeming, it would follow that they are objects of mistakencognitions. Moreover, according to the intention of such scriptures as theAºgulim›lıyasÒtra,341the nirv› ̊a of the lesser vehicle342is not the ultimate. Thus,it would follow that those who achieve it are in a mistaken mental state. In brief,by adducing the above reasons, it is not possible to satisfactorily account for therealities being definitely two in number. One might wonder, though, whether there is a definite number of two or fourrealities in Buddhism, since the Buddha also taught that all phenomena are106The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 106"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"included in the four realities of the noble ones. However, these were taught forspecific purposes and thus are of expedient meaning. In terms of the definitivemeaning, the first two realities of suffering and its origin do not exist by nature,and the reality of the path is finally left behind like a boat after one has crosseda river. Therefore, they are not truly real as such. Also, the seeming is of a delu-sive nature and thus not real. Therefore, all phenomena are primordially naturalgreat cessation, or nonabiding nirv› ̊a. This is the ultimate and only reality.However, in terms of the final definitive meaning, neither real nor delusive istaught. As The SÒtra Requested by Brahm›viŸe ̋acinti343says:Look, Brahm›, when I dwell in the heart of enlightenment, I do notknow “real” and “delusive.”The SÒtra of the Meditative Concentration of the Wisdom Seal of the Thus-GoneOnes344declares:Some speak here about four realities.When residing in the heart of enlightenment,Not even a single reality is seen to be established.So how could there be four?Practically speaking, most misconceptions about the Buddhist teachings havetheir root in the two realities’ not being properly understood and distinguished.Moreover, many statements in the scriptures may seem to be contradictory orparadoxical if they are not seen in the proper context of the two realities. AsEdward Conze puts it:The thousands of lines of the Prajñ›p›ramit› can be summed up in thefollowing two sentences: 1). One should become a Bodhisattva (or,Buddha-to-be), i.e., one who is content with nothing less than all-knowledge attained through the perfection of wisdom for the sake ofall beings. 2). There is no such thing as a Bodhisattva, or as all-knowl-edge, or as a “being,” or as the perfection of wisdom, or as an attain-ment. To accept these contradictory facts is to be perfect.345It is not just a matter of “accepting contradictory facts,” however, but ratherof gaining a thorough understanding of each of the two realities, because thenthere are no contradictions at all. However, if the two perspectives of these real-ities are mixed, or if one of them is mistakenly used as an argument to negate theother, everything becomes very confusing. Moreover, this opens the way for allkinds of wrong ideas and conduct, such as “Everything is empty, so what doesThe Middle from Beginning to End 107Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 107"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"anything matter?” “All phenomena are primordial nirv› ̊a, so everything is justpure and fine.” “Since there are no positive or negative actions, I can do what-ever I like.” “Things cannot be empty, because we all experience a common worldand the workings of cause and effect.” The two realities are taught precisely inorder to avoid falling into these extremes of either total nonexistence or solidexistence, because both notions lead to wrong actions and ensuing suffering. Asa rule, it may be said that as long as we experience afflictive emotions and suf-fering (as the expressions of a dualistic mental framework), we are right in themiddle of seeming reality, no matter what we might wish for or pretend. In thissituation, it does not help at all to deny or cover this experiential reality with amisunderstood conceptual overlay of emptiness or ultimate reality. In otherwords, as long as our experiences are bound to seeming reality, our mental devel-opment and our actions have to be carried out within this framework too. Nomatter how lofty our theories or understanding may be, as long as we experienceourselves as distinct persons and as subject to the causes and results of our actions,there is no way to ignore such causes and results. Moreover, to do so would pre-vent us from using seeming reality in an appropriate way, which is the only wayto actually transcend it. As Bh›vaviveka’s Jewel Lamp of Centrismsays:In order to guide beginners,A method is taught,Comparable to the steps of a staircase,That leads to perfect Buddhahood.Ultimate reality is only to be enteredOnce we have understood seeming reality.346Thus, as a Centrist, while practicing or behaving in the context of seeming real-ity, it is only for the sake of the result—liberation from suffering—that oneadopts the things to be adopted and abandons the things to be abandoned on thislevel. At this time, one does not simultaneously analyze one’s actions for their ulti-mate reality in order to invalidate them. Moreover, to do so would just take oneback to square one, since the same analysis—when applied to the sufferings anddifficulties that one still experiences on the seeming level—would equally annulthe very problems that got one started on the path. But as we all know, it doesnot help to analyze our miseries away. In addition, ultimately or when analyzed,not practicing on this nonexistent path is as empty as practicing. If a person ishappy this way—not suffering and not doing anything about it—that is surelyfine. However, if we still feel uncomfortable—or feel even more uncomfort-able—after having analyzed everything to zero, we might want to get back togood old conventional reality and do something about it. ⁄›ntideva says:108The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 108"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Merit in relation to illusionlike VictorsIs just the same as in the case of real entities.. . .No matter whether on the seeming or the actual level,According to the scriptures, this has a result,Just as worshipping a real BuddhaWill yield a [real] result.“Without sentient beings, whose is the result?”This is true, but we still strive on the level of ignorance.For the sake of completely pacifying suffering,You should not spurn this ignorance in terms of the result.Self-centeredness—the cause for suffering—Increases through the ignorant belief in a self.You might say, “You cannot put an end to this,”But it is better to meditate on identitylessness.347The Heart SÒtrastates:There is no attainment and no nonattainment. Therefore, ⁄›riputra,since bodhisattvas have no attainment, they rely on the perfection ofknowledge and abide in it. In their minds, there are no obscurationsand no fear. By leaving behind all mistakenness, they reach the finalnirv› ̊a.Thus, to apply the unity of the two realities is to pay complete attention to ourmental, verbal, and physical actions in the experiential context of seeming real-ity, while constantly imbuing and lightening—not annihilating—this processwith a good dose of awareness of ultimate reality. “To lighten” may well be under-stood here in two senses: not being so heavy-handed with ourselves and others,as well as bringing more light into this world. The better we understand the tworealities and their relationship, the more this will enhance our practice of com-bining wisdom and skill in means.

Thus, to say that“phenomena lack a nature” refers to their lack of a nature in the sense of somereal, identifiable, intrinsic “own-being” that exists independently. Such a natureis the primary target that is refuted in Centrism. On the other hand, when empti-ness is called “the nature of all phenomena,” this designation is only justified onthe mere conventional level in light of the following three aspects: the nature ofphenomena is not produced newly through any of these phenomena, it is alwaysunmistaken, and it does not change into something else when it finally is fullyrealized. Thus, it is only from such a conventional perspective that this “nature”is said to be unfabricated and not dependent on anything else. As The Funda-mental Versesstates:It is not reasonable that a natureOriginates from causes and conditions.A nature that originates from causes and conditionsWould be a nature that is produced.How could a “produced nature”Be suitable as a nature?Natures are unfabricatedAnd not dependent on anything else.350Taking the five aggregates (such as form) as examples, The SÒtra of Vimalakırti’sInstructionsstates:Form itself is empty. Form does not become empty through beingdestroyed, but it is the nature of form to be empty. . .351As “the emptiness of emptiness” and “the emptiness of the nature” among thetwenty emptinesses described below explicitly teach, emptiness is no exception to110The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 110"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"being empty. In other words, emptiness as “the nature of all phenomena” justindicates the lack of nature of all phenomena, including emptiness itself. Thus,what is called ultimate reality is just the fact that seeming reality does not exist byits nature. In this way, the very lack of any nature is the unmistaken nature of bothrealities. However, a nature that is established in any way—be it by a nature of itsown or the lack thereof—is not suitable as the nature of either of the two realities.In brief, all phenomena are empty of a nature of their own, which is conven-tionally called their nature. As N›g›rjuna’sSeventy Stanzas on Emptinessdeclares:The eye is empty of an identity of its own.It is also empty of any other identity.[Visible] form is empty in the same way.Also the remaining sources are alike.352The Entrance into Centrismsays:Since it is its nature,The eye is empty of an eye.In the same way ears, nose, tongue,Body, and also mind are to be interpreted.Since it is its nature,[Visible] form is empty of [visible] form.Sound, smell, taste, tangible objects,And also phenomena are just like that.353What is said here is that the eye and all other phenomena lack a nature in thesense that they are empty of a nature of their own and that this is their nature.That the eye is empty of a nature of its own does not mean that the eye is emptyof a nature that is something other than the very eye itself, as Candrakırti’s auto-commentary explicitly clarifies:Here, one speaks about emptiness [as the fact] that the eyes and so on[are empty] of these very eyes and so on. This makes it completelyclear that [this is] the emptiness of a nature, whereas it is not an empti-ness of one not existing in an other, [such as] “the eye is empty, sinceit lacks an inner agent” or “it is empty of the nature of apprehender andapprehended.”354As usual, however, such formulations of phenomena being empty of them-selves or lacking a nature are not presented as the results of reasoned analysis thatThe Middle from Beginning to End 111Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 111"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"are established in any way through the Centrists’ own system. It is only in orderto accord with the kind of analysis that is common consensus for others thatemptiness is said to be the nature of all phenomena in the above sense of beingunfabricated and not dependent on anything else. Thus, this “nature” that isexpressed in such a way does not have any nature itself, nor is it established as anynature. This is the intention that is contained in the above verses. They are for-mulated by superimposing this notion of “nature” onto the lack of a nature forthe sake of counteracting the common notion of an independent, intrinsic, andreal nature that ordinary beings entertain. In actual fact, there is no nature of thetwo realities that is established in any way at all. Therefore, the Buddha said thatall phenomena are neither empty nor nonempty, neither existent nor nonexist-ent, neither unarisen nor not unarisen. It is just with the intention to counteractspecific wrong views of different beings that some Centrists have taught thatthere is a nature of phenomena, while others said that there is no such nature.Some explained that this nature is emptiness and some that it is not emptiness.Others said that entities exist, and still others stated that entities do not exist.However, in the Centrists’ own presentation of the two realities, such referencepoints as to whether a nature of anything exists or not are never put forward onany level.Some people interpret this term “nature” in a mistaken way, saying, “Since theseeming nature of fire, for example, is dependently originated, it is not suitableas its nature. On the other hand, since its ultimate nature is not dependentlyoriginated, it is suitable as its nature.” However, neither of the two realities issomething static, but they are both presented in a way that is based on the processof dependent origination. The nature of seeming reality is delusive dependentorigination, and it is in comparison to this that the nature of ultimate reality—undelusive dependent origination—is justified as its nature. The Treasury ofKnowledgeexplains emptiness as signifying the unity of identitylessness anddependent origination. In the word “emptiness,” “empty” means nonexistence,and what does not exist is any identity of persons or phenomena; -nessstands fordependent origination, or the apparent conditioning of phenomena. One mightwonder then, “Does emptiness as the nature of phenomena exist?” From the per-spective of the noble ones, since it is beyond speech, thought, and expression,what could be said about it? However, from the perspective of the seeming, thatis, the world of dependent origination, one cannot say that it does not exist. Ifone took the position that emptiness does not exist, it would be pointless forbodhisattvas to train in the path of the six perfections in order to realize thisemptiness.This is explained by using three technical terms: the basis of emptiness, theobject of negation, and the basis of negation: 112The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 112"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"a) The basis of emptiness (all that bears the nature of being empty) is all phe-nomena.b) The object of negation (that of which phenomena are empty) is any personaland phenomenal identity.c) The basis of negation (that which is empty of these objects of negation) is allphenomena.This formulation implies that the basis of emptiness, the object of negation,and the basis of negation are identical. Thus, the way in which phenomena areempty is that all phenomena are empty of themselves; they are empty of any realnature or identity of their own. For example, let’s take the appearance of a tableas the basis of emptiness, that is, as that which has the nature of being empty.When analyzed, this seemingly real appearance of a table has no findable realidentity as a table (the object of negation). For, “the table” exists only as a con-ceptual construct through our having lumped together the distinct data of ourfive sense perceptions into some imaginary whole. Apart from what we perceivethrough our senses, there is no table. And these sensory data themselves are nota table either, since they are nothing but color, shape, texture, and so on. More-over, they also lack any real or inherent existence, since they are merely a seriesof ephemeral, flickering appearances without any identifiable core. In this way,the basis of negation is the mere appearance of a table. In summary, the table isempty of (being) a table.This is why it is said that all phenomena are empty of themselves: When ana-lyzed through reasonings that analyze for the ultimate, there is no phenomenonthat is established as this given phenomenon itself. However, emptiness does notmean that phenomena are not empty when not analyzed and then become emptywhen analyzed with reasoning. Emptiness is not some kind of spiritual atombomb that evaporates our world. Nor do we meditate on phenomena that areactually nonempty as being empty, thus producing some conceptually fabricatedemptiness. Likewise, it is not the case that phenomena are nonempty as long asthe wisdom of the noble ones has not arisen and then become empty once it hasarisen. Nor does emptiness refer to something that existed before and thenbecomes nonexistent later, such as a candle flame that later dies out. Also, empti-ness does not mean that phenomena are empty of an object of negation that issomething other than these very phenomena, such as a vase being empty of water.Nor does emptiness mean that something is utterly nonexistent, like the hornsof a rabbit. All of these notions are mistaken emptinesses, since they are notempty of their own nature and thus represent various kinds of mentally con-trived emptiness, emptiness in the sense of extinction, or limited emptiness.Therefore, they are not suitable as the foundation for the path to liberation noras the remedy for the two obscurations.The Middle from Beginning to End 113Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 113"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"In the midst of all the technicalities, reasonings, and concepts related to empti-ness, it is important not to lose sight of the essential point of all this. The fun-damental concern of Centrists is liberation from cyclic existence and attainmentof Buddhahood. Thus, emptiness is not some sophisticated philosophical ormetaphysical concept, nor is it just some kind of metalanguage. Rather, its realand only significance is that the realization of what it actually refers to is the sin-gle suitable foundation for achieving these goals of liberation and omniscience.Primordially, all phenomena—from the everyday objects of our senses up to themost subtle level of Buddha wisdom—are not established as any kind of referencepoint, such as existent, nonexistent, real, delusive, empty, or nonempty. It is justthis fact that is conventionally labeled as “emptiness,” “true reality,” “suchness,”and so on. In terms of labeling, there is nothing more to it. However, the directrealization of the actuality to which the label “emptiness” points is precisely whatserves as the path to liberation and the remedy for the two obscurations. As TheFundamental Versessays:What is dependent originationIs explained as emptiness.It is a dependent designationAnd in itself the middle path.355Since both afflictive and cognitive obscurations originate from clinging toreally existing things, yogic practitioners put an end to all such clinging oncethey realize that all phenomena are primordially free from all discursiveness andreference points. To rest in meditative equipoise within the actual native state ofall phenomena—all phenomena being empty of a nature of their own—is theremedy for all obscurations. It is the sun that outshines the darkness of mistakenviews and the cure that eliminates the poison of reification. Emptiness is thequintessence of the Buddha’s teaching and the supreme cause for gaining mas-tery over the five inexhaustible spheres of adornment of all Blissfully Gone Ones:enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity.Elaborations on SimplicityThis simple emptiness has been elaborated into a number of classifications ofemptiness in the scriptures. Of course, there are no divisions in emptiness, but suchclassifications are made from various points of view and for specific purposes.To begin, emptiness may be classified as twofold:1) “emptiness of analyzing all aspects” that is limited and arrived at through men-tal analysis and114The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 114"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"2) “emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects.”Pawo Rinpoche quotes MañjuŸri:The emptiness of analyzing all aspectsIs without a core, just like a banana tree.The emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspectsWill never be like that.When one thoroughly analyzes what phenomena’s own nature is, that nature isemptiness. Thus, in having no core, all phenomena are similar to a banana tree.356However, the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects lies completelybeyond the sphere of analysis. And no matter how it might be analyzed, it is notand does not become like the first emptiness, a bare emptiness of inherent nature.This is because the unity of wisdom and emptiness never changes into anythingother than just this unity.What this latter emptiness is endowed with are all excellent remedial qualities,such as the six perfections. Thus, it is both emptiness and that which makes oneattain unsurpassable Buddhahood. In The Sublime Continuum,357illustratedthrough the example of a group of painters drawing the king’s portrait, thisemptiness is explained as the full manifestation of the Dharma Body. The SÒtraRequested by Crown Jewelgives an extensive description of this emptiness:Donning the armor of great love and grounded in great compassion,[the bodhisattva] practices meditative stability that manifests in theform of the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects. Here,one may wonder, “What is this emptiness endowed with the supremeof all aspects?” It is that in which [the perfections of] generosity, ethics,patience, vigor, meditative stability, knowledge, and means are com-plete. It is that in which great love, compassion, joy, and equanimityare complete.358In it, engagement in the wisdom of reality is com-plete. The mind of enlightenment—considering sentient beings—iscomplete. The application of [a bodhisattva’s] intention and supremeintention is complete. Generosity, pleasant speech, beneficial activ-ity, and consistency [in words and deeds]359are complete. Mindfulnessand alertness are complete. The four applications of mindfulness, thefour correct exertions, the four limbs of miraculous powers, the fivefaculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, andthe eightfold path of noble ones360are complete in it. Calm abidingand superior insight are complete too. Giving, being tamed, perfectcontrol, and certainty are complete.

It is not endowed with negative dharmas and is endowedwith all positive dharmas. It is continuously blessed with the mode ofbeing of Buddhas. It is perfectly embraced by the blazing mode ofbeing of the dharma. It is endowed with the all-encompassing modeof being of the spiritual community. It is blessed by beholding all sen-tient beings. It is exquisitely embellished by the full accomplishmentof Buddha bodies. It consummately entails melodious Buddha speech.It is endowed with the equality of the meditative concentration ofBuddhas. It possesses the miraculous powers and the individual per-fect awarenesses of Buddhas. It is perfectly embraced by the force ofthe ten powers, dwells in the four fearlessnesses, and is in accordancewith the eighteen unique qualities of Buddhas; that is, it is not mixedwith the vehicles of hearers and solitary realizers. In it, afflictionstogether with their affiliations with latent tendencies are eliminated.It is not separated from the wisdom of supernatural knowledge. It isthe reliance of all sentient beings and entails the four reliances. Itincludes the equality of mundane and supramundane phenomena. Itis without blame, since it fully matures all sentient beings. It is skill-ful in guiding them and eliminates all sufferings of sentient beings. Init, all afflictions are purified. It has crossed the stream [of cyclic exis-tence], and all clinging is severed in it. It is utter natural peace and notdisquieted in the midst of karma and afflictions. It is equanimitythrough the nature of phenomena. It observes all Buddhadharmas. Itis inert by its own specific characteristic. It is courageous in grantingblessings. Its intrinsic state is to be disengaged while constantlyengaged in the activities of Buddhas. It is composure through utterpeacefulness. It is the constant effort to mature sentient beings. Thisis called “the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects.” . .. If it does not exhibit one of these aspects, it is not the emptinessendowed with the supreme of all aspects. At the point when theaspects of all Buddhadharmas are fully complete and visible and whenthere is no coexistence with any afflicted agitations or discursivenessof focusing on characteristics, this is the emptiness endowed with thesupreme of all aspects.361In his Stages of Meditation, KamalaŸıla emphasizes the meditative cultivationof this emptiness, since—unlike a bare emptiness—it leads to perfect Buddha-hood.362Mikyö Dorje agrees that this emptiness is the great perfection of knowl-edge. Pawo Rinpoche’s commentary clearly says that the emptiness that is taughtin the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasand commented on by N›g›rjuna is this “emptinessendowed with the supreme of all aspects.” The reason is that this emptiness com-116The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 116"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"pletely forsakes all reference points and thus connects one with all the qualitiesof the five paths, the ten grounds, and the final result of Buddhahood.There is another twofold classification of emptiness:1) emptiness associated with stains and2) emptiness without stains.As The Distinction between the Middle and Extremessays:As for afflicted phenomena and purified phenomena,[One] is associated with stains and [the other] is without stains.Its purity is considered in the same wayAs the element of water, gold, and space are pure.363The second chapter of The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºkalists seven emptinesses:Mah›mati, in brief, emptiness is sevenfold: the emptiness of definingcharacteristics, the emptiness of the nature of entities, the emptiness ofpossibility, the emptiness of impossibility, the emptiness of all phe-nomena being inexpressible, the great emptiness of the ultimate wis-dom of noble ones, and the emptiness of one [not existing in] an other.. . . This emptiness of one [not existing in] an other, Mah›mati, isvery inferior, and you should abandon it.364Among these, it is only the emptiness of defining characteristics that qualifies asthe ultimate emptiness of Centrists.In terms of the bearers of the true nature of phenomena, the sÒtras even speakabout sixteen, eighteen, or twenty kinds of emptiness. The Prajñ›p›ramit› SÒtrain One Hundred Thousand Lines365and the revised edition of The Prajñ›p›ramit›SÒtra in Twenty-five Thousand Lines366list all these twenty emptinesses. Based onthis, firyavimuktisena and Haribhadra have ascertained their total number astwenty. The Prajñ›p›ramit› SÒtra in Eight Thousand Linesand the tantras speakabout sixteen emptinesses. Thus, Maitreya’s Distinction between the Middle andExtremes, Dign›ga’s Summary of Prajñ›p›ramit›,367and other texts list sixteenemptinesses. Needless to say, all these enumerations are merely explained in termsof the seeming in order to remedy certain concepts, wrong views, and clingingsof different disciples on various stages of the path.The Twenty EmptinessesIn his Chariot of the Tagbo Siddhas, the Eighth Karmapa follows the explanationof Candrakırti that presents twenty emptinesses.368In general, these can be con-The Middle from Beginning to End 117Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 117"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"densed into the two identitylessnesses. Thus, the twenty emptinesses are assertedas the path of the great vehicle, since they teach phenomenal identitylessness asthe remedy for cognitive obscurations in detail.1)The emptiness of the internalmeans that the six sense faculties of eye, ear, nose,tongue, body, and mind are empty of any nature of their own. To lack anynature of their own is their very nature.2)The emptiness of the externalindicates the same for the six objects of these sixfaculties, such as forms and sounds.3)The emptiness of the internal and the externalmeans that both the inner sensefaculties and their outer objects are without nature.4)The emptiness of emptinessclarifies that emptiness itself is also empty of a natureof its own. The purpose of explaining this fourth emptiness is to put an endto the clinging that emptiness itself is established as anything in any way. InThe SÒtra Requested by K›Ÿyapa, the Buddha warned against holding on to orsolidifying emptiness in any way:“K›Ÿyapa, those who conceptualize emptiness by focusing on it asemptiness I explain as those who fall away from this teaching. K›Ÿyapa,those who have views about the person that are as big as Mount Meruare better off than those who proudly entertain views about empti-ness. Why is this? K›Ÿyapa, as emptiness means to emerge from allviews, I declare that those who have views about this very emptiness areincurable. K›Ÿyapa, it is as follows: For example, if you give a diseasedperson medicine and this medicine cures the entire disease but stays inthe person’s stomach and does not come out again, K›Ÿyapa, what doyou think? Will this person be released from disease?” “O Blessed One,this person will not [be released]. If this medicine cures all of the [orig-inal] disease but stays in the stomach and does not come out again, theperson will develop a very severe stomach disease.” The Blessed Onesaid, “K›Ÿyapa, in the very same way, as emptiness is the only way toemerge from all views, I declare that those who have views about thisvery emptiness are incurable.”N›g›rjuna’s Praise to the Supramundanesays:In order to relinquish all imagination,You taught the nectar of emptiness.However, those who cling to itAre also blamed by you.369118The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 118"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The siddha Saraha is also quite outspoken about this in his statement thatthose who cling to the existence of things are as stupid as cattle, while thosewho cling to emptiness are even worse.5)The emptiness of the greatrefers to the lack of an intrinsic nature of the wholeuniverse, which consists of the outer surroundings and the sentient beingsthat live in them.6)The emptiness of the ultimaterefers to nirv› ̊a’s absence of a nature of its own.Nirv› ̊a is considered the ultimate supreme purpose to be achieved by sen-tient beings. However, the Buddha taught it to be empty too in order to putan end to the wrong notions of nirv› ̊a being existent, nonexistent, both, orneither. This emptiness of the ultimate refers to the natural nirv› ̊a or thenonabiding nirv› ̊a. It does not refer to the nirv› ̊as with remainder370orwithout remainder371in the vehicles of hearers and solitary realizers.7)The emptiness of conditioned phenomenarefers to the emptiness of everythingin the three realms of existence that originates from causes and conditions andentails arising, abiding, and ceasing.8)The emptiness of unconditioned phenomenais the lack of an intrinsic nature ofeverything that is without arising, abiding, and ceasing.9)The emptiness of what is beyond extremesmeans that the middle way, whichis free from the two extremes of permanence and extinction and so on, isitself empty of being beyond all extremes.10)The emptiness of that which is without beginning and endrefers to the empti-ness of cyclic existence, which is without beginning and end because it is freefrom coming from somewhere or going somewhere. Its emptiness is that itis empty of being without beginning and end.11)The emptiness of what is not rejectedrefers to what is to be adopted. In gen-eral, flaws are to be rejected, and what has no flaws designates what is to beadopted. The latter are the purified phenomena, that is the two accumula-tions of merit and wisdom. That these are empty of being something that isnot rejected is the emptiness of what is not rejected.12) As for the emptiness of the primordial nature,372the very nature of phenomenais that they have no nature. It is nothing but their lack of any nature that islabeled their “nature.” This nature is not something that was made by thenoble ones or the Buddhas. Rather, the nature of all phenomena is primor-dially empty emptiness. Thus, phenomena are not made empty throughemptiness or anything else; they are just naturally empty. However, thisempty nature of phenomena is also not established as any nature whatsoever.In fact, the nature of phenomena itself lacks any nature, and this is what iscalled “the emptiness of the primordial nature.” In terms of the basis ofemptiness, as for their meaning, there is no difference between this “empti-ness of the primordial nature” and “the emptiness of emptiness.” However,The Middle from Beginning to End 119Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 119"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"these two are explained separately in order to put an end to two aspects ofclinging: clinging to emptiness as being emptiness and clinging to emptinessas being the actual nature of phenomena. The essential point for both theseemptinesses is that the Buddha taught emptiness as the remedy for viewingall phenomena as nonempty, solidly existing things. If this remedial empti-ness itself were not empty of a nature of its own as well, or if it had the natureof being an identifiable and actually existing nature, which reifying viewcould be more enormous than that? This is precisely the situation that isreferred to as the antidote turning into poison. The Karmapa gives a furtheranalogy for the detrimental effect of clinging to emptiness: If water is all thatone has to extinguish a fire and then this water itself turns into a blazing fire,there is no means left to extinguish the fire.13)The emptiness of all phenomenameans that each single phenomenon withinthe entire spectrum of conditioned and unconditioned phenomena is with-out a nature of its own.14)The emptiness of specifically characterized phenomena373refers to the lack of anature of the entire range of specifically characterized phenomena, startingwith form up through omniscience.15) As for the emptiness of the unobservable,374what is unobservable are the threetimes. The past has ceased already, the future has not yet arisen, and the pres-ent moment cannot be found when analyzed for a beginning, a middle, or anend. However, to consider what is not observable in this way as having thenature of being unobservable is an error. Thus, the emptiness of the unob-servable means that the unobservable three times lack the nature of beingunobservable.16)The emptiness of the nature of nonentities375means that all phenomena origi-nate from infinite interdependent causes and conditions and thus lack anyintrinsic nature of being a real collection that is set up by anything in any way.After this explanation of sixteen emptinesses in the above-mentioned Prajñ› -p›ra mit› sÒtras, there follows a description of four more emptinesses that sum-marize them.17)The emptiness of entities376is the emptiness of the five aggregates.18)The emptiness of nonentities377refers to the emptiness of all unconditionedphenomena, such as space and nirv› ̊a.19)The emptiness of self-entity378means that there is no nature of the self-entity ofall phenomena. It is the nature of phenomena—emptiness—that is explainedas their “self-entity,” since it was never produced through the seeing of thewisdom of the noble ones. That this empty self-entity too is empty of itselfis expressed as “the emptiness of self-entity.”120The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 120"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"20) As for the emptiness of other-entity,379Candrakırti’s autocommentary onTheEntrance into Centrismgives three reasons that emptiness can be called “other-entity.” First, conventionally, emptiness is not established as any nature what-soever. In actual fact, however, emptiness abides all the time as the supremetrue reality of all things, whether Buddhas appear or not. In this respect, it isother than the phenomena of the seeming that bear this nature, since they donot exist all the time. Second, since emptiness is what is to be realized by ulti-mate supreme wisdom, it is other than the things of the seeming that are notwhat is realized by this wisdom. Third, emptiness is beyond cyclic existence.Thus, it exists “on the other side” of it. The seeming, however, is not beyondcyclic existence.380Thus, the highest reality or the suchness that is completelyunchanging and has the defining characteristic of emptiness is “the emptinessof other-entity.”In the context of these last two emptinesses, the single emptiness that is thebasic nature of all phenomena is expressed in two different ways by using theconventional terms self-entityand other-entity. However, again, both of theseemptinesses are not established as any entities of their own. In order to determinethis single emptiness, first, it is taught that the self-entity of this emptiness lies inits being a natural emptiness that is not produced by the noble ones. Conse-quently, the emptiness of such a self-entity is that it is empty of being this natu-ral, unproduced emptiness. Second, this very same emptiness may also be calledother-entity or supreme entity. However, while using such a formulation in orderto comply with some systems that are the common consensus of others, it isclearly determined that the very nature of such an other-entity is also nothing butemptiness.The way in which these twenty emptinesses are related to the different levelsof the path are presented in Haribhadra’s commentary Illumination of The Orna-ment of Clear Realization.381The first three pertain to the phase of engagementthrough devoted interest.382The fourth is related to the level of the supremedharma.383The following seven (5–11) correspond to the seven impure groundsof bodhisattvas, and the next three sets of two (12–17) to the three pure groundsrespectively. The last three emptinesses (18–20) pertain to the Buddha ground.They are associated with Buddhahood, because the first is the foundation forrelinquishing the afflictive obscurations including their latent tendencies; thesecond is the foundation for relinquishing the cognitive obscurations includingtheir latent tendencies; while the last has the sense of self-existence.384Whenexplained in this way, during the phase of engagement through devoted interest,the corresponding emptinesses are the objects that are realized through the validcognition of a reasoning consciousness, or the objects that are realized through aconsciousness that is approximately concordant with yogic valid perception.385The Middle from Beginning to End 121Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 121"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Those emptinesses that relate to the grounds of bodhisattvas explain what is real-ized through the corresponding levels of yogic valid perception. On the Buddhaground, none of these twenty bearers of emptiness is observable as anything what-soever by the wisdom of omniscience.In some scriptures, one finds references to “eighteen emptinesses.” However,these are not a different set of emptinesses. With the exception of numbers (17)and (20), they are the same as those in the preceding enumeration.The Sixteen EmptinessesIn general, when one speaks about “the sixteen emptinesses,” this can refer to oneof two slightly differing sets of sixteen. The first set consists of the sixteen empti-nesses as they were described in the enumeration of twenty emptinesses above.The second set is found in Maitreya’s Distinction between the Middle and Extremesand other texts.386The following is a presentation of this second list.The first four emptinesses are related to seeming reality:1)The emptiness of the internalis the lack of nature of the six sense faculties.2)The emptiness of the externalis the lack of nature of the six objects of these fac-ulties.3)The emptiness of the internal and the externalis the emptiness of any physicalbases of these two, such as the sense organs387and outer matter.4)The emptiness of the greatrefers to the lack of nature of the whole universe,including the inanimate surroundings and all sentient beings who live inthem.The next two emptinesses correspond to ultimate reality:5)The emptiness of emptinessrefers to the emptiness of the wisdom that directlysees that the first four emptinesses are empty.3886)The emptiness of the ultimaterefers to the way in which this wisdom seesemptiness as the perfect actual mode of being of all phenomena. This modeof being is called the ultimate because it is undeceiving. That this ultimate isnot established as a nature of its own is “the emptiness of the ultimate.”The bases of emptiness of the next eight emptinesses are taught for particularpurposes, because the eight phenomena that are the bearers of these emptinessesare related to the practice of bodhisattvas:7)The emptiness of conditioned phenomenais the emptiness of the conditionedpositive phenomena of the path.8)The emptiness of unconditioned phenomenameans the emptiness of the uncon-122The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 122"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"ditioned positive phenomena of nirv› ̊a.9)The emptiness of what is beyond extremesrefers to the emptiness of the middleway that bodhisattvas practice in order to benefit limitless sentient beings.10)The emptiness of what is without beginning and endis the emptiness of a bodhi-sattva’s practice of not giving up cyclic existence in order to not abandonsentient beings.11)The emptiness of what is not rejected means the emptiness of rendering all thatis positive inexhaustible within the nirv› ̊a without remainder through ded-ications and the perfection of power.12) The emptiness of the primordial naturerefers to the emptiness of cultivating thebodhisattva’s primordial nature—the naturally abiding disposition389that isnaturally pure and also empty of adventitious stains—in order to purify itfrom these stains.13)The emptiness of specifically characterized phenomena means the emptiness ofthe major and minor marks of a Buddha.14)The emptiness of all phenomenarefers to the emptiness of all the qualities of aBuddha, such as the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the eighteenunique qualities.The first four of these last eight emptinesses refer to what bodhisattvas have incommon with hearers and solitary realizers. The last four refer to the uncommonfeatures of practicing the great vehicle.390The key for bodhisattvas to engage inthe great vehicle in a fully qualified way is the realization of emptiness. How isthat? The word “bodhisattva” denotes a being who is courageous enough to gen-erate the mind of enlightenment and strive for Buddhahood for the sake of allsentient beings. Bodhisattvas are said to be courageous, because they are notafraid of three things: the infinite number of sentient beings to be liberated, theinfinite time it takes to liberate them, and the great hardships they have to gothrough in order to help these beings. Considering this overwhelming task, howcan bodhisattvas be so brave or—as one would say nowadays—unrealistic? Evenwith great compassion and a lot of goodwill, as long as they take cyclic existenceto be real, there is no way that they could reasonably entertain the hope of everaccomplishing the liberation of infinite beings or lightheartedly take upon them-selves all the difficulties that such a project involves. Thus, it is precisely becausebodhisattvas are fundamentally “un-realistic”—not taking things as real alto-gether—that they can bear whatever appears and work with it. On the otherhand, if cyclic existence is not realized as being empty, it is impossible not tobecome weary of both its many sufferings and all the effort it takes to liberateone’s fellow beings. Consequently, one will reject cyclic existence and abandonsentient beings.Through the realization that cyclic existence is just an illusion, a bodhisattva’sThe Middle from Beginning to End 123Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 123"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"own experiences and perceptions are completely unaffected by all samsaricdefects, just as a lotus has its roots in the muddy ground of a pond but rises abovethe water as an immaculate flower. However, emotionally, bodhisattvas are notat all unaffected by seeing the states of sentient beings who—unlike themselves—still take this illusion of cyclic existence to be real and thus are under its sway. Ina way, this is the same as when we watch the usual bad news on television andare aware that none of it is really happening on our screen. Still, what we seemight very well trigger compassion in us for those who are going through theactual experiences that we are seeing. So in itself, what we see there is not our ownexperience, and—unlike the people whose actual experience it is—we are notunder its control. Rather, it is still we who have the remote control and can flipthrough the channels (unfortunately, this does not mean that we are in full con-trol of that process . . .). Likewise, since bodhisattvas are not under the controlof what happens to others in cyclic existence, they have no problem in staying andworking within what appears to others as samsaric reality. However, realizingemptiness is not at all a dull, numb, or undifferentiated blank state of mind inwhich nothing goes on anymore. In fact, in terms of bodhisattvas’ own experi-ence, it is said that it is their greatest joy to help other beings who suffer, so theyenter cyclic existence with the same delight as when we plunge into the refresh-ing waters of a cool lake on a hot summer day.Finally, there are the last two emptinesses that summarize the preceding four-teen:15)The emptiness of nonentitiesis presented in terms of the two objects of nega-tion—imaginary persons and phenomena—being negated.16)The emptiness of the nature of nonentitiesis presented from the perspectivethat the persons and phenomena in terms of the nature of phenomena391existas the remainder after the negation of the above two objects of negation.392Again, these last two emptinesses are not self-sufficient emptinesses that dif-fer in any way from the other fourteen. Rather, they are just further divisions byway of conceptual isolates. The purpose of presenting them separately is to elim-inate the two extremes of superimposition and denial with respect to each indi-vidual basis of emptiness. Therefore, the last two emptinesses are added for thesake of understanding that the elimination of the extremes of superimpositionand denial must cover all fourteen preceding emptinesses. These two extremesmean neither mistakenly superimposing existence onto imaginary persons andphenomena nor categorically denying the persons and phenomena in terms of thenature of phenomena.When we compare the two above presentations of (A) twenty emptinesses and124The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 124"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"(B) sixteen emptinesses, in addition to slightly varying orders of enumeration,393there are a number of differences in content and emphasis. Roughly speaking, onecould say that (A) presents emptiness more from a general point of view or interms of it being the object to be realized. On the other hand, (B) often empha-sizes the emptiness of the path as the process of realizing emptiness and of themind that travels on this path, that is, the subjective aspect that cultivates andrealizes emptiness. These tendencies show in that certain bases of emptiness aremore or less dissimilar in (A) and (B).In the enumeration of sixteen emptinesses, the emptiness of the internal andthe external (B3) does not refer to the sum of internal sense faculties and exter-nal objects but specifically to their physical bases. The emptiness of emptiness(B5) does not refer to emptiness in general or to emptiness as the object to be real-ized; it emphasizes that also the subjective side—the wisdom mind that realizesemptiness—is empty. The same goes for the emptiness of the ultimate (B6), asit refers to the subjective mode of realizing the ultimate, in which the emptinessof “subjective” wisdom and the emptiness of “objective” emptiness are undiffer-entiable. Emptinesses (B9) through (B12) all highlight certain aspects of the prac-tice of bodhisattvas: The emptiness of what is beyond extremes (B9) does not justrefer to the emptiness of the middle way itself but makes it clear that the actualpractice of this middle way is empty as well. The emptiness of what is withoutbeginning and end (B10) not only indicates the emptiness of cyclic existence butalso shows that the ongoing compassionate activity within this empty cyclic exis-tence by a bodhisattva who has realized its emptiness is empty too. The empti-ness of what is not rejected (B11) means that all activities on the path to providefor and to ensure the inexhaustible qualities and activities of a Buddha are empty.As for the emptiness of the primordial nature (B12), the basis of this emptinessis not the empty nature of all animate and inanimate phenomena in general.Rather, it is the practice of uncovering the true nature of sentient beings’ mind,or Buddha nature, which is called their “naturally abiding disposition.”394Nodoubt also this practice of revealing our Buddha nature is no exception to beingempty. The bases of the emptiness of specifically characterized phenomena (B13)are not all such phenomena but only the excellent major and minor characteris-tics of a Buddha. Finally, the basis of the emptiness of all phenomena (B14) doesnot refer to the entirety of all phenomena in general but is limited to all theenlightened qualities of Buddhahood.In conclusion, the Eighth Karmapa says that in reference to the “sixteen empti-nesses” in Centrism, their definitive meaning is the interpretation as given byCandrakırti in the above enumeration of twenty emptinesses. This is because inCentrism all phenomena are empty of a nature of their own.The Middle from Beginning to End 125Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 125"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Two Types of IdentitylessnessLost IdentityThe contemporary Tibetan master Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche said in one ofhis talks, “Some people are afraid that, in Buddhism, they would lose their ego.That is true, but you can tell them that they don’t have to worry, it will comeback.” This statement is surely good for a laugh, but—as we will soon see—at thesame time it profoundly illuminates the basic problem.On a slightly more serious note, I am afraid a few words on the translation ofthe Sanskrit term nair›tmya(Tib. bdag med) as “identitylessness” are unavoid-able. Nowadays, in English translations, a persistent, common worldly consen-sus of rendering this term as “selflessness” or “egolessness” has developed. If onedisregards the relatively superficial flaw that the word “selflessness” usually refersto something completely different (an altruistic attitude or behavior) from whatnair›tmyameans, the above renderings may be acceptable as common worldlyconsensus when used in a more casual context. Such translations not only entaila number of major problems when used in a more strict philosophical sense, butare in fact obstacles to a correct and deeper understanding of the meaning ofnair›tmyaas one of the most central topics in Centrism.Originally, the Sanskrit word ›tmanmeant “breath.”395In non-BuddhistIndian philosophy, it came to primarily indicate the ultimate true essence of eachindividual sentient being—one’s “true self,” “soul,” or “pure spirit.” Notwith-standing other varying features, all schools that assert this ›tman agree that it ispermanent, singular, independent, and really existent. It is what has to be liber-ated from the illusions of cyclic existence. In Buddhist philosophy, the term is notlimited to an eternal individual soul but refers to the general notion of a singu-lar, permanent, and independent entity or identity that really exists by its ownnature.This notion is precisely what Centrists negate. They distinguish two types ofthe lack of such an ›tman: the lack of a personal ›tman and the lack of an ›tmanof all other inner and outer phenomena. For example, Centrists speak of thenonexistence or the lack of an ›tman of a table. Now, the English terms “self” and“ego” refer solely to a person’s being or individuality; they are never used in rela-tion to inanimate things. Thus—except in modern-day “Buddhist hybrid Eng-lish”—one would normally never speak of the “self of a table,” much less the“ego of a table.” Both linguistically and in terms of meaning, it is more appro-priate to speak of analytically seeking and not finding any real identity of a table.The same goes for a real identity of a person. This is clearly expressed in Can-drakırti’s commentary on firyadeva’s Four Hundred Verses:“Identity” (›tman) refers to a nature (svabh›va) of entities that does not126The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 126"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"dependend on anything other. The nonexistence of this is identity-lessness (nair›tmya). Through classifying it in terms of phenomenaand persons, it is understood as twofold: “phenomenal identityless-ness” and “personal identitylessness.” The “person” is what is imputedin dependence on the five aggregates. . . . “Phenomena” are the enti-ties that are called “aggregates,” “sources,” and “constituents.”396Thus, in order to cover this meaning of nair›tmya, the terms “personal iden-titylessness” and “phenomenal identitylessness” were chosen.397From this expla-nation, it should also be clear that “identitylessness” in general is an equivalentof emptiness. The lack of a real identity and the lack of a real nature refer to thesame basic fact. Hence, what is explicitly described in detail through the variouspresentations of emptiness above refers mainly to phenomenal identitylessness,while personal identitylessness is implicitly included in these emptinesses.Specifically, as for “personal identitylessness,” there is no clear distinction inordinary Western thinking between “self,” “ego,” and “person.” In addition, var-ious psychological and philosophical schools use a great many different defini-tions for each of these terms. Hence, by using expressions such as “the self of aperson,” “the ego of a person,” or “personal self,” it is very difficult, if not impos-sible, to understand the striking difference between the two terms “identity” and“person” as they are used in Buddhist philosophy. As a consequence, the crucialpoint of precisely identifying the actual target of the Buddhist refutation of areal personal identity is likely to be missed. For, the conventional notion of a per-son who performs various functions on the seeming level is never questioned.TheEntrance into Centrismsays:Although he is free from the views about a real personality,398The Buddha taught “me” and “mine.”In the same way, all entities are certainly without nature,But he taught the expedient meaning that they “exist.”399Thus, in terms of personal identitylessness, the object of negation through Cen-trist reasoning is the idea that a person really exists in an independent waythrough his or her own nature. This notion is precisely what the deeply ingrainedinstinctive impulse of believing in ourselves as single individuals holds on to.That this impulse is largely unconscious just makes it all the more effective andpowerful.According to Centrists, the clinging to a personal identity is in turn based onthe even more fundamental grasping for a real identity of phenomena in general.This means that as long as we take things in general to be real, we will always pickout one or more among them and cling to it as something real, taking it eitherThe Middle from Beginning to End 127Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 127"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"in itself to be our imagined personal identity or as something that supports orreinforces this sense of identity. Thus, the two kinds of identity are very closelyinterconnected.400N›g›rjuna’sPrecious Garlandsays:As long as the clinging to the aggregates existsFor that long there is also [the clinging to] “me.”Through this identification with “me,”Again, there is karma and thus, again, rebirth.401So how is the term “identity” used here? On the one hand, “personal identity”is a mere imputation on the basis of the five aggregates that lacks any nature.Through beginningless fundamental ignorance and in dependence on the fiveaggregates, we presume a nature of a person that serves as the particular founda-tion or continuity for our actions and experiences. In more technical terms, sucha person is seen as the underlying basis for karmic actions and their results. Thisis the imaginary referent object of the clinging to “I” and “me,” which is con-tinuously present in all sentient beings who possess basic ignorance. In otherwords, it is just what we fancy when we think, “This is me.” It may also be called“the experiencer,” “the individual,” and so on.“Phenomenal identity” refers to the assumed real existence of all phenomenaon the basis of which such a personal identity is ascribed or that seem to be underits control (such as one’s own body and mind) as well as to all other objects, suchas other beings or inanimate forms. In dependence on the material elements andour mind, we cling to a real nature of phenomena such as visible forms and thevarious consciousnesses experiencing them. We take some phenomena to exist asthe objective entities that give rise to others—our subjective consciousnesses—which apprehend them. In brief, to cling to phenomenal identity means to clingto the real existence of all material and mental phenomena that are other thanwhat we regard as our personal identity.This description of the two types of identity may give rise to a number ofquestions. We might think that we do not really see ourselves or phenomena ashaving such hard-and-fast identities. And even if we did, what is wrong withexperiencing ourselves as “me” and phenomena as real and different from this“me”? Why did the Buddha teach identitylessness? And why should we try to getrid of some identity that we obviously never had in the first place? In other words,why is it such a big issue in Buddhism to negate the two identities?When we look a bit closer into our habitual ways of referring to ourselves,such as in ordinary language and thinking, we discover a number of obviousinconsistencies and contradictions that show the underlying fundamental con-fusion. Sometimes we label and treat some or all aspects of our individual fiveaggregates as constituting an “I,” while at other times we rather regard them as128The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 128"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"something related to this “I.” The funny thing is that usually nobody seems tobe aware of this, let alone bothered by it. For example, we tend to say such thingsas “my legs,” thus making—and experiencing—a clear distinction between “me”and these legs that are “mine.” We do not think, “I am my legs.” We clearly feelthat “me” is something more than just legs. Still, we say, “I am walking,” thoughwhat actually moves are the legs or maybe the whole body. However, we wouldn’tsay, “My legs walk” or “My body walks.” Now, if it is really “me” and not justmy legs walking, does that mean that my mind or my feelings walk too? Similarly,we say, “I am sick,” “I have a headache,” and also “My head aches.” So who orwhat aches here or is sick, the head or me? Usually, we consider our head and our-selves as different, so what harm does it do to “me” if my head aches? And howis this different from anybody else’s head aching, which is equally different from“me”? Another typical example is to say both “my mind” and “I think” or “Ifeel.” So, again, is it my mind that thinks and feels, or is it “me”? If the mind were“me” or the self, it would be a contradiction to call it “mine”; this would be asimpossible as something being both me and my car. To take yet another instance,what do we really mean when we say, “I wash myself”? Does the “I” wash the “I,”does the mind wash the body, or does just one hand wash the other parts of thebody? So sometimes we regard our mind as “me” and the body as “mine,” andsometimes it is the other way around. We might think of “myself” being locatedsomewhere in the upper body or in the head and then consider the feet as “myfeet.” Or, we see the head as “mine” and the rest of the body as “me.” Usually,the “I” feels to be inside “my skin” and sees this skin as something outer that stillbelongs to this “I.” Occasionally, we even feel “out of our minds” altogether.No doubt, we can easily come up with a zillion more examples of such highlyinconsistent talking and thinking. So how does all this nonsense come about? Themain reason for such inconsistencies is that we are constantly shifting the objector basis to which we are referring when we say “I,” “me,” and “mine.” In fact, thisvery shifting of what we regard as “me” and “mine” points in itself to the fact thatthere is no such thing as a stable and unchanging “me.” As long as we do not ques-tion all of this, it seems to be a completely natural and convenient way of dealingwith ourselves and our world, and it usually works just fine. However, faced withthe simple question “Who am I?,” we all have a very hard time coming up with aclear answer or definition of exactly who or what we are. The more we think aboutthis, the more difficult it is to pinpoint something. In fact, it is not at all clearwhat this “I” or “me” really is, evidently not even to “ourselves.” So, if we do notquestion it, our self seems to be the most obvious and close thing we can imagine.However, as soon as we search for it, other than running into further inconsis-tencies, there is nothing to be found. It is like trying to catch a rainbow in space.Of course, one might say, “Well, all of this is just conventional talk, so whymake it into a problem?” From one point of view, nothing could be truer, and ifThe Middle from Beginning to End 129Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 129"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"we were to leave it as nothing but conventional discourse, also from the Centristpoint of view, there would in fact be no problem whatsoever. But the crucialpoint here is that it is not really this notion of “me” or some personal identity assuch that is considered the root of cyclic existence. Rather, the problem lies withour instinctive subjective clinging to such a vague personal identity, which is inturn based on the even more fundamental clinging to phenomenal identity. Thisbasic impulse of experiencing everything from the perspective of “I” and “me”seems to be the most natural thing in the world and usually goes completelyunquestioned. For example, we may go to a shopping mall and look at somenice, expensive watches. If the shop owner drops one of these watches and itbreaks, we are not really too worried. We might even be relieved and think, “I’mglad it wasn’t mine.” However, if we receive this very watch as a birthday pres-ent and it breaks, our reaction is surely not that detached. Yet it is the same watchand the same thing that happened to it. We might watch a multicar crash on thenews and not waste many thoughts on all those wrecked cars (though one wouldhope we would on the people who drove them). But how do we feel if we detecta small scratch on our own car? Where is this “mine” that seems to make all thedifference and causes us suffering? Is “mine” the same as the Swiss watch? Or is“mine” different from it? Is “mine” inside the watch or outside of it? Whensearched for, it is nowhere to be found. However, according to the Buddha, it isprecisely this tendency to experience everything in terms of “me” and “mine”that makes us feel distinct from others, develop attraction and aversion, and actthese emotions out, which in turn causes all our well-known miseries. As Dhar-makırti’sCommentary on Valid Cognitionsays:If there is a self, consciousness about others [arises].From the aspects of self and others, clinging and aversion [result].Then, through our close connection with these,All flaws come forth.402To be sure, there is no problem in just thinking or saying, “I am Kim,” “Iwalk,” “This is my car,” and so on. As good Buddhists, we might even have triedto go through all these painful Madhyamaka reasonings to disprove a single andunchanging self and understand that there is no such thing. However—and nowwe come back to Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche’s words—our actual hang-up isthat we constantly keep thinking and acting as ifwe really were independent andsingle individuals with our own case history or personal file. This shows in ourimpulses to protect this somebody from what he or she does not like and chaseafter what he or she feels attracted to. This is how we find ourselves in the mid-dle of the rat race of cyclic existence. The spontaneous, natural ease with whichthis functions is illuminated by an anecdote about a great siddha who remained130The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 130"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"in advanced meditative equipoise for many years. During all this time, he stayedin the hut that belonged to him and his wife. When he finally rose from his med-itation, the first thing he asked his wife was, “Where is my dinner?” She justanswered, “If this is all that came out of your meditative equipoise, you’d bettergo right back and practice some more.”In general, when asked, most of us would agree that we are not permanent orcompletely independent. However, when we are directly reminded of our imper-manence in ways that we cannot ignore, such as getting gray hairs, falling ill,being in a car accident, or facing death, we usually become very upset. Likewise,if asked, we would surely say that our left big toe is not our personal self, but whenit hurts or when we even lose it, we do not at all regard ourselves as separate fromthis toe. Thus, one very effective meditation on personal identitylessness is toconsider how it affects our individual sense of identity to imagine losing, one byone, all our body parts. In addition, we can ask ourselves, at what point in thisprocess of losing our limbs do we still feel like the same person whom we believewe are now, in full possession of all our body parts? Do we change in our existenceas John or Mary when we lose one finger, or does that take several limbs? Whatif just our torso and head were left? And when do we cease to exist as a person alto-gether? The same contemplation can be applied to losing our relatives, our friends,our possessions, and certain features of our mind, as with senility. Such medita-tions might sound strange, but in practice they are excellent and powerful toolsfor learning something about ourselves and our attachments in a personal way thatis quite different from mere theoretical speculations about a hypothetical self. Atthe same time, they also work on our concepts of regarding our body and mindas well as all other phenomena as real and distinct entities, such as seeing the col-lection of many body parts as a single “body”; taking the diversity of our momen-tarily changing feelings, thoughts, and perceptions to be one “mind”; or regardingan assemblage of various wooden or metal parts as a “chair” or a “car.”Thus, the fundamental reason that the precise identification of these two kindsof clinging to an identity—personal and phenomenal—is considered so impor-tant is again soteriological. Through first uncovering our clinging and then work-ing on it, we become able to finally let go of this sole cause for all our afflictionsand sufferings. Thus, the actual object of negation of reasoning in the context ofknowledge through study and reflection is nothing more than this instinctivemistaken mode of cognition that takes the two kinds of identity to be really exis-tent. This very same tendency to reify where there is nothing to be reified is alsowhat must be let go of in meditation practice. In more technical terms, it is theobject of negation of the path of yogic valid perception that arises from medita-tion. In this way, such innate clinging is the actual object of negation of both rea-soning and the path. The Entrance into Centrismsays:The Middle from Beginning to End 131Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 131"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"First, we cling to our self, saying “me,”Then we develop attachment to things, saying “this is mine.”Through mentally seeing that afflictions and mistakes without exceptionOriginate from the views about a real personalityAnd realizing that the self is the object of these [views],Yogic practitioners negate a self.403When we analyze the object of negation in Centrist reasoning, it should beclear that the two kinds of identity have no possible existence as actual objects thatare to be negated. It is impossible for any phenomenon to exist as a permanent,singular, and independent personal identity. Likewise, a phenomenon that isreally established through an intrinsic nature of its own is not possible either.However—and this cannot be repeated too often—the actual target in the con-text of negating the two kinds of identity is the clinging to these identities on thesubject side. In other words, the object of negation is a mistaken cognition, awrong conception that apprehends something nonexistent as existent. Since thereis no actual object of negation on the objective side, there never was anythingobjective to be relinquished. So “negating an identity” is just another expressionfor the process of letting go of our subjective clinging to imaginary identities. Ofcourse, from the Centrist point of view, this clinging itself is not something realeither. However, as long as there is an individual mistaken notion of an object,there is also the notion of a subject. Consequently, with the realization that anobject is illusory, the subject that held on to it dissolves naturally. On the otherhand, if there were an object of negation that was established as an actual object,we would not be able to relinquish it anyway, no matter how hard we tried. Forno one can successfully negate something that actually exists or, for that matter,prove the existence of something that does not actually exist.Thus, for Buddhist reasoning and meditation to be soteriologically efficient,it is crucial to acknowledge that their actual target lies not at the level of theapprehended objects—the notions of a real personal or phenomenal identity—but at the level of the apprehending subject—the largely unconscious and instinc-tive clinging to such identities. Again, the reason that this clinging needs to betackled is that it is the initial spark that triggers the blaze of desire for some phe-nomena and aversion to others, eventually spreading into the wildfire of samsaricdistress. For example, desire arises from thinking that “I” need something orsomeone. Hatred arises when people harm us and we think that they harmed“me.” Pride is based on the thought that “I” am better than others. We experi-ence jealousy or envy because we think that some persons, possessions, qualities,or honors should be “mine.” As for unawareness or ignorance, it is often a hazystate of mind. However, it also shows clearly and most fundamentally in this132The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 132"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"very sense of “me” and “mine,” which in turn is the basis for the arising of “my”other mental afflictions. Further, more active expressions of ignorance are thethought “I don’t care” and the refusal to look at how things really are.Fundamentally speaking, it is impossible to tackle our subjective experiencesand our clinging right away. We cannot stop this initial impulse of grasping bysimply telling ourselves, “Just don’t cling.” Nor does it help to think, “I will notgive rise to mental afflictions anymore.” Yet, whenever we think “me” or “mine,”this always refers to some object, sometimes our body and sometimes our mind,that we mistakenly call “me” and “mine.” That is why Madhyamaka works viathe demonstration and realization that there are no such identities to be graspedin the first place. There is nothing that could serve as a reference point for ourclinging and our afflictions. It is only upon clearly seeing this that we can finallyrelax and let go of holding on to what is not there. This is similar to what happens if someone mistakes a water hose with a zig-zag pattern in the garden for a snake. There never was a snake in this hose in thefirst place, but due to the misconception of a snake this person will panic, startto tremble and sweat, and run away. So there is a whole chain reaction of mis-taken—and completely unnecessary—cognitive, emotional, physical, and verbalactions and reactions, but they are all due to the initial mistaken notion of asnake. What would somebody else do to help that person calm down? Surelythere is no point in administering tranquilizers, doing psychotherapy against fearof snakes, or merely trying to soothe the person by saying, “Don’t be afraid. Justrelax, take it easy.” And even if these methods were to help for a while, the nexttime the person would encounter that hose (or a similar one), the same dramawould unfold again. So other people would point out that there never was asnake, but just a hose. Still, just having this pointed out by somebody else is alsonot sufficient. The person who is afraid has to arrive at her own certainty thatthere was no snake, is no snake, and will be no snake in that hose. Such certaintycan only be gained through this person’s own examination of the hose, thus see-ing that it lacks any characteristics of an actual snake. Only then can the personfinally relax and maybe even laugh about the whole event. Thus, it is onlythrough the personal realization that there is no object to justify the fear whichis experienced that the experiencer—the perceiving subject—can let go of theclinging to the existence of a snake and be relieved of the ensuing suffering.Another example for this kind of misconception are patients who wander fromone doctor’s office to another, deeply convinced that they have a tumor, despitethe evidence from countless tests and examinations that they do not. As TheCommentary on Valid Cognitionsays:Without invalidating its object,One is not able to relinquish this [clinging to identity].404The Middle from Beginning to End 133Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 133"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"To return once more to the initial statement that people are afraid to lose theirego in Buddhism, is it really frightening or maybe just boring to realize identity-lessness?

Rather, thereis only a lot to gain—freedom from suffering—by letting go of what ties us downand makes us suffer: our clinging and grasping to something that does not existanyway. When we realize that there is nothing to lose and nobody to be harmed,we can relax and let go of the idea that we have something to lose, and let go ofour attempts to hold on to or protecting this something. Usually, we are afraidthat without our sense of “me” and real things we would not be able to live ourlives in an organized way. In fact, however, such grasping to real things and a real“me” makes everything quite heavy, complicated, and clumsy. In addition, it usesup a lot of our energy that could be spent in more joyful and beneficial ways. Sowhen we stop this misguided use of our mental potential, we have free access tothe whole scope of its dynamic vitality. The true qualities of the nature of ourmind can shine forth unimpededly, and life may become a playful dance ofappearances.

At the beginning, everything isvery clumsy; you have to think a lot and coordinate your mind, your fingers, theinstrument, and the notes, and they all seem separate and disconnected. But onceyou are trained to a certain degree, you might become completely absorbed in theprocess of making music, “losing yourself” in your playing. You don’t think ofor experience yourself as a particular person or a player; there is not even a senseof “me” anymore. Likewise, you don’t perceive the instrument, the fingers, andyour mind as different or separate things. Still, or—from the Buddhist point ofview—because of that, this does not mean that there is nothing going on or thatthis situation is depressing. On the contrary, it is an alive and joyful state ofmind. Everything flows together in a playful and lighthearted dance. In fact, theless you think about yourself—or anything else, for that matter—the better youcan play and the more the instrument, the melody, and the player become one.Technically speaking, personal identitylessness and phenomenal identityless-ness are taught in order to liberate all beings from both afflictive and cognitiveobscurations. Personal identitylessness is taught mainly to liberate hearers andsolitary realizers. In addition, phenomenal identitylessness is taught for the sakeof bodhisattvas attaining omniscience. One might wonder, “If there is no self,does that mean that there is also nothing that is `mine’?” Obviously, if there is134The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 134"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"no agent, there is nothing to be acted upon either, just as there is no vase if thereis no potter to produce it. Thus, without “me,” there is nothing that is “mine”or “other.” And if visible forms and so on are not observed, there are also nothoughts of attachment and aversion. Therefore, when the aggregates are seen asbeing empty of a self and what is related to such a self, nobody sees anything thatcould be cyclic existence. This is called liberation. The Precious Garlandsays:The aggregates that originate from the clinging to “me”And the clinging to “me” are actually delusive.How could there be a real arisingOf something whose seed is delusive?When one sees that the aggregates are thus not real,The clinging to “me” will be relinquished.Once this clinging to “me” has been relinquished,The aggregates will not originate anymore.405firyadeva’s Four Hundred Verses on the Yogic Practice of Bodhisattvassays:If one sees that objects are without identity,The seed of existence ceases.406The Entrance into Centrismsays:Because there is no object without agent,Therefore, what is mine does not exist without a self.Consequently, yogins regard a self and what is mine as emptyAnd thus are completely released.407Therefore, by not grasping at cyclic existence, hearers and solitary realizers passinto nirv› ̊a. As for bodhisattvas, they realize both identitylessnesses completely,but because of their great compassion they continue to assume various forms ofseeming existence that merely appear for the benefit of others.Phenomenal IdentitylessnessTwo types of phenomenal identitylessness may be distinguished:1) the innate type, which comes from the instinctive clinging to phenomenalidentity2) the imaginary type, which is superimposed through philosophical systemsThe Middle from Beginning to End 135Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 135"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The innate phenomenal identity refers to the object of the instinctive mis-conception of ordinary worldly beings who naturally see each phenomenon ashaving a real and specific nature of its own. “Phenomena” includes everythingfrom form up to omniscience.

In addition, there are the conventions of those who cling tosome particular identity of phenomena. These are the conceptual imputations byBuddhists and non-Buddhists that are neither common worldly consensus norsomething spoken by the Buddha. They do not exist even on the conventionallevel and include non-Buddhist notions such as all knowable objects beingincluded in six, sixteen, or twenty-five categories;408notions common to someBuddhists and non-Buddhists, such as infinitesimal atomic particles; and Bud-dhist notions, such as hidden but real outer referents, a real, nondual, and self-aware other-dependent nature, a ground consciousness, a permanent andunconditioned Buddha nature that is adorned with all the major and minormarks, or an imaginary personal self that is established through conventionalvalid cognition.Of course, most people will object here that the Buddha indeed spoke abouta ground consciousness and the other Buddhist notions above. Karmapa MikyöDorje’s answer is that, in general, when the Buddha spoke on the level of noanalysis, conventionally, one can distinguish between an expedient meaning anda definitive meaning in his words.409On this conventional level, such terms as“ground consciousness” are of expedient meaning that entails a certain intentionand is meant to guide disciples toward liberation. Still, some Buddhists mightcling to these expressions as presenting something real, since they were spoken bythe Buddha. However, the Buddha’s intention was to communicate somethingon the conventional level, and it is precisely on this conventional level that suchterms do not carry any definitive meaning. The main reason for this is that they136The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 136"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"do not even represent common worldly consensus but just imputations arrivedat through philosophical speculation. For example, the notion of a ground con-sciousness was mainly introduced to explain how karmic actions are stored andripen into their results, even over many lifetimes. Centrists question the neces-sity of such a storehouse consciousness as the basis for karma, but not the meredependently originating operation of karmic cause and effect on the seeminglevel. As such, this operation definitely is a part of common worldly consensus.Likewise, it is said that self-awareness is necessary for having a memory. Again,the mere fact of remembering is common worldly consensus and thus not dis-puted in Centrism, but it is denied that there is some further really existent basisfor memory, be it self-awareness or anything else.On the other hand, everything that the Buddha said on the level of analysis—all the presentations within the setting of the two realities—is solely of definitivemeaning. Nothing of what he taught on the level of analysis is of expedient mean-ing. In brief, both on the level of the seeming and the ultimate reality, any hypo-thetical, real nature of any phenomenon from form up through omniscience ingeneral as well as all superimpositions of such a nature are natural emptiness.This is the supreme essential pith of the Centrist teachings.In the general context of explaining the view, among the two types of iden-titylessness, phenomenal identitylessness is usually ascertained first for the fol-lowing reasons:410First, the coarse form of phenomenal identitylessness is the negation of realexistence (its object of negation). Certain degrees of understanding coarse phe-nomenal identitylessness are common to both Buddhists and non-Buddhists.Thus, in general, it is easier for everybody to start with phenomenal identity-lessness than personal identitylessness, which is extraneous to non-Buddhist systems.Second, after one has determined that all phenomena are empty of a nature oftheir own, it is implicitly established that a so-called personal identity that weimpute through innate ignorance onto our five aggregates is also empty of anature of its own. For it is realized that all possible bases for the mistaken viewof a personal identity are without nature.In this way, the realization of phenomenal identitylessness relinquishes thetwo obscurations. Therefore, phenomenal identitylessness is said to be the pri-mary one among the two types of identitylessness.Personal IdentitylessnessPersonal identitylessness is the unique, distinctive feature of the followers of Bud-dhist philosophical systems. Obviously, there are also many non-Buddhists whopossess various degrees of realizing coarse phenomenal identitylessness as well asThe Middle from Beginning to End 137Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 137"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"those whose beliefs entail following a course of positive ethical conduct. There-fore, the actual difference between non-Buddhist and Buddhist views lies in theacceptance versus the denial of a real identity of the person.As with phenomenal identity, there are two types of a hypothetical personalidentity:1) the subtle, innate personal identity, which is the object of the innate clingingto it2) the coarse, imaginary personal identity, which is imputed through philosoph-ical systemsThe so-called innate personal identity or self refers to the object of “the innateviews about a real personality.” Here, “a real personality” refers to a really exist-ing self that is somehow related to the five aggregates, which are in themselvesmomentarily impermanent and collections of many parts. “The views about it”may simply be classified as two: the clinging to “me” and to “mine.” Usually,however, they are explained as twenty in number. These consist of four differentpossible ways of relating each of the five aggregates to a personal self. To take theaggregate of form411as an example, these four are as follows:a) the view that form is the selfb) the view that the self by nature possesses formc) the view that the self by nature exists in formd) the view that form by nature exists in the selfThe same applies to the remaining four aggregates, thus resulting in a total oftwenty such misconceptions. These misconceptions are called views, but in thecontext of the innate clinging to a personal identity, they are to be understoodmore as the various natural expressions of our instinctive, gut-level impulse ofexperiencing ourselves as distinct beings. This originates from the beginninglesshabituation of taking the five aggregates as reference points for thinking “I,”“me,” and “mine.” This habituation naturally exists in all sentient beings, and ina sense one could call it a kind of survival instinct, since it leads to our efforts ofsustaining what we see as “me” and protecting it from harm. Thus, neither thisclinging nor its object—”I” or “me”—depends on any imputation through philo-sophical or other belief systems. When not analyzed, the personal identity or“self” that is the object of the innate views about a real personality can be said tonominally exist on the mere conventional level, because the clinging to “I” and“mine” is experientially present in all sentient beings and shows through their ver-bal expressions and behaviors.The so-called “imaginary personal identity or self is based on the innate cling-138The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 138"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"ing to a personal identity, but it is not naturally present in all beings. Rather, itis what is newly imputed in various ways through studying, reflecting on, ormeditating on the conceptual superimpositions in different views or philosoph-ical systems. This may be seen as a real self, an individual true identity or the coreof the person, such as a permanent, self-sufficient, and single ›tman or the vari-ous theories about an “ego” in Western psychology. The clinging to such imag-inary personal identities is called “the imaginary views about a real personality.”The objects of these views are nothing but labels by certain people and schools.They are not common worldly consensus. Therefore, they do not exist either asconventions that appear in common for everybody or as parts of seeming reality.Karmapa Mikyö Dorje lists three general types of an imaginary personal identity:a) imputations of a personal identity that is either something other than or thesame as the five aggregates, such as an eternal, single, and autonomous self asadvocated by most non-Buddhist Indian schools, or the position of some of theHighly Venerated Ones412who say that the aggregates or the mind itself are theselfb) the imputation that the self is neither the same as nor different from the aggre-gates, as it is upheld by the followers of V›tsıputra413c) Tsongkhapa’s assertion of a personal self that is established through conven-tional valid cognition and serves as the support for the continuity of karmicactions and their results, that is, the personal self that is imputed onto theaggregates and not mingled with the personal self that is understood as theobject of negation of reasoning.When expressed on the conventional level, the assumed, innate personal iden-tity that is the object of our innate clinging is just a label applied in dependenceon the five aggregates, such as saying, “I am Ben.” This is not different from call-ing a collection of different parts a “car.” Centrism does not at all negate that thisplain convention exists on the seeming level without analysis. On the level ofanalysis, however, what Centrism does negate on the level of both seeming andultimate reality is that there is something really existing by its own nature towhich this label “I” refers. The reasons for this object of our innate clinging to apersonal identity being negated are as follows: All afflictions and problems orig-inate on the basis of the views about a real personality, which constitute the sub-jective mental states of clinging to an innate personal identity. In addition, thewisdom in the meditative equipoise of noble ones does not see any such innateidentity even on the conventional level.On the other hand, any “imaginary personal identity” is categorically negatedon both the level of no analysis and the level with analysis, as well as on both lev-els of reality. For, let alone ultimate reality, such an imaginary personal identityThe Middle from Beginning to End 139Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 139"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"does not even fall under seeming reality, since it does not accord with any of thecommon conventions of either worldly people or noble ones. As for the impactof the imaginary views about a personal identity (which take imaginary personalidentities as their objects), in addition to being mistaken in themselves, theyintensify and solidify the innate views about a personal identity as well. Further-more, if one clings to any kind of imaginary personal identity or self, one will nottravel the path to liberation and omniscience through the middle way that relin-quishes the two extremes.When considering the many imputations and technicalities in the views that arerefuted in Centrist texts, one might come up with the following objection: “As wassaid, the fundamental cause of cyclic existence is the innate clinging to a personalidentity or self. However, Centrist texts do not state any reasonings to negate theself that is the object of this innate clinging. Is it not unreasonable to exclusivelyreason against all kinds of imaginary types of self, when the actual cause of sam-saric suffering is the innate clinging to a self?” There is no problem here, since theobject of the innate clinging to a personal identity—whether this is considered tobe a self, a real personality, an individual, or a sentient being—is not the objectof negation as long as it is just accepted as a mere convention on the level of noanalysis, such as saying, “I walk” or “I meditate.” Such a mere conventional label“I” as it is used in our everyday transactions is not negated in Centrism, because—just as with all other conventions—it is neither possible nor necessary to negateit. All conventions are mere agreements to put certain tags or symbols on certainappearances, so what is there to negate? In other words, there is no reason for notcalling a house a house. This name is as good as any other name, such as maisonin French or casain Italian, but since English-speaking people have agreed onhouse, there is no reason for them not to communicate with this label. Otherwise,one would have to negate all naming altogether. Thus, there is no need to negatesuch conventional labels as “I” and “house,” since—as bare labels—they do noharm and in fact assist us in accomplishing our worldly transactions.On the other hand, in the context of negation through analysis, the reasoningsthat negate the first three types of an imaginary personal identity also functionas reasonings to negate any innate personal identity. For, any notion of an innateself does not lie beyond the three ways of analysis through reasoning that coverthese three types of imaginary self. Moreover, these reasonings negate the entiretyof all objects onto which both the innate and imaginary views about a real per-sonality can possibly grasp. Therefore, it is not the case that Centrist texts fail tonegate the innate type of a personal identity.In general, if one does not realize that all kinds of personal identity are emptyof a nature of their own, one is not able to realize phenomenal identitylessnessin an exhaustive way. In other words, if personal identitylessness is not fully real-ized, there is no complete realization of phenomenal identitylessness either.140The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 140"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Are the Two Identitylessnesses One or Different?In general, all phenomena lack both a personal and a phenomenal identity. Morespecifically, the question of the existence of a personal identity primarily appliesto such phenomena as our body and mind, as it is pretty obvious for most peoplethat such inanimate things as tables and houses do not have a personal self. Thus,in Centrism, inanimate things are addressed primarily in terms of their lack of realexistence, or phenomenal identitylessness. As was said earlier, holding on to a per-sonal identity with respect to body and mind is based on regarding body andmind as really existent. In the same way, other phenomena may also serve as addi-tional reference points for sustaining our clinging to a personal self that per se pri-marily focuses on our psychophysical continuum. Therefore, both types ofidentitylessness apply to all phenomena. They just differ in their specific objectsof negation. Since the object of negation in the case of personal identitylessness isan “I” or “self,” this identitylessness is formulated as the inverse of its particularobject of negation, that is, “personal identity.” In terms of phenomenal identity-lessness, what is to be negated is “real existence,” or a real “phenomenal identity”.Consequently, this identitylessness is also presented from the perspective of revers-ing its specific object of negation. In this way, both identitylessnesses are concep-tual specifications that are the inverses of their respective objects of negation.Thus, technically speaking and on the mere conventional level, the two iden-titylessnesses can be said to be one in nature and different isolates. The reasonsfor this are as follows: Since all phenomena are equally without identity, they can-not be differentiated in the slightest through their entities. Consequently, anykind of assumed personal identity is just a specific instance among hypotheticalidentities of phenomena in general. For example, a phenomenon such as a bookmay serve as a basis for attributing certain features to it, yet there is nothing in itthat can be apprehended as a really existing thing. However, if the appearance ofthis book is identified as such a basis for attribution in the context of mere tem-porary designation, the “personal identitylessness” of this book may be under-stood as its lack of an identity of its own. The book’s phenomenal identitylessnessmeans that there is no book that is really established. These two facts—that anown identity of the book is not established and that the book is not establishedas something that really exists—are undifferentiable in nature. They can only beseparated in a conceptual way by referring to different objects of negation.The Purpose of Teaching Two IdentitylessnessesHere, one may wonder, “If the two identitylessnesses are undifferentiable innature, why is it necessary to distinguish between them? Moreover, if personalidentitylessness is an instance of phenomenal identitylessness, it should be suf-The Middle from Beginning to End 141Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 141"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"ficient to teach only phenomenal identitylessness. Also, if the purpose to beaccomplished—liberation and omniscience through the elimination of the twoobscurations—is already fulfilled through one’s realizing the teaching on phe-nomenal identitylessness, it seems pointless to speak as well about personal iden-titylessness.”The reasons for explaining both identitylessnesses are as follows: The Buddhataught personal identitylessness primarily in order to take care of those with thedisposition of the lesser vehicle. Thus, this identitylessness serves to graduallyintroduce those of lesser capacities to the teachings. Furthermore, it is the step-ping-stone for the liberation of those who have the dispositions of hearers andsolitary realizers. There is a definite necessity to teach personal identitylessness tothose with these dispositions, because release from cyclic existence is not possi-ble if this identitylessness is not taught and cultivated accordingly. However,hearers and solitary realizers are not suitable vessels for the extensive teachings onthe identitylessness of all phenomena in the continua of infinite sentient beings.For their goal of personal liberation from cyclic existence, it is sufficient to explic-itly teach them only personal identitylessness (which is, however, based on andimplicit in phenomenal identitylessness). Thus, even if phenomenal identity-lessness were explicitly and fully taught to them, for the time being, they wouldneither need it nor benefit from it. Therefore, they are taught only personal iden-titylessness, they meditate on it, and they realize it completely. On the otherhand, phenomenal identitylessness is taught extensively in order to take care ofbodhisattvas as those who have the disposition of the great vehicle. Since it is thegoal of bodhisattvas to attain omniscience and work for the welfare of all otherbeings, it is for this purpose that they are mainly taught phenomenal identity-lessness. As Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrismsays:In order to liberate beings, this identitylessnessWas taught in two aspects, classified in terms of phenomena andpersons.414From Knowledge to WisdomThe Perfection of KnowledgeTo conclude the discussion of Madhyamaka ground, let us take a closer look atwhat it is that knows or realizes all these things like “the two realities,” “empti-ness,” “the two identitylessnesses,” and “the nature of the mind.” As mentionedin the introduction, it is the perfection of knowledge—prajñ›p›ramit›—that isthe primary subject or mental factor that actively develops and experiences all thelevels of insight into the nature of all phenomena. As for the scope of the term142The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 142"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"prajñ›—knowledge or understanding—in Buddhism, this term does not refer tosome kind of passive knowledge or to merely knowing some facts. Rather, itstands for the vast range of actively knowing and investigating the appearancesand the true nature of all phenomena from form up to omniscience. It meansintelligence in its original sense of being able to know or cognize,415which entailsthe capacity to clearly discriminate. Thus, the definition of “knowledge” in Bud-dhism is “that which fully and exhaustively discriminates the general and specificcharacteristics of phenomena.”In other words, prajñ› is the basic inquisitiveness and curiosity of our mind,which is very precise and playful at the same time. Usually it is symbolized by adouble-bladed, flaming sword. This sword is extremely sharp, and such a thingobviously should be handled with great care. It even may seem somewhat threat-ening. Prajñ› is indeed threatening to our ego and to our cherished belief systems,since it undermines our very notion of reality and the reference points uponwhich we build our world. Thus, it is what questions who we are and what weperceive. Since this sword cuts both ways, it not only serves to slice up our verysolid-looking objective reality, but it also cuts through the subjective experiencerof such a reality. In this way, it is also that which makes us see through our ownego trips and self-inflation. It takes some effort to continuously fool ourselvesabout ourselves. Prajñ› means being found out by ourselves, which first of allrequires taking an honest look at the games we play. If we keep inflating ourselves,prajñ› is what punctures the balloon of ego and brings us back to where we are.All of this is especially important on the Buddhist path, since prajñ› cuts notonly through delusion but also through any tricky attempt by our ego to takecredit for doing this. Our ego has no scruples about swallowing spirituality ingeneral or Buddhism in particular and incorporating it into its territory to justserve as a further embellishment of King Me. No, we are not just an ordinary per-son; now we have become a spiritual person, studying difficult philosophical textsand doing profound meditation practices. Thus, as we proceed along the path,prajñ› seems to become increasingly important and must be refined more andmore in order to spot and immediately pierce the colorful bubbles of personalizedspiritual attainments. This quality of prajñ› is symbolized by the flames on thesword: They illuminate our dark corners, put us right under the spotlight, andburn all the seeds of fancy and ignorance. There is a sense of having no escape. Wecannot hide from ourselves or pretend to be unaware of what is going on in ourmind. Prajñ› lights up the entire space of our mind, so where could our mind hideitself? In this way, prajñ› is also the direct antidote to the more active tendenciesof our ignorance, our not wanting to look too closely at ourselves and our lives.Sometimes, we think that knowledge means having all the right answers, butprajñ› is more like asking all the right questions. Often the question isthe answer,or much better than any answer. Trying to get all the right answers down mayThe Middle from Beginning to End 143Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 143"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"just create more reference points in our mind and thus more rigidity and prob-lems. Also, often one answer produces ten new questions. To let prajñ› unfoldin a natural way means to give our basic inquisitiveness more space to take a walkand look around on its own with its astute and unbiased freshness. We should notrestrict it to merely rearranging or expanding our cocoon of dualistic categories.Iconographically, prajñ› is mainly represented by the female deity Prajñ›p›ramit›and the male deity MañjuŸrı. Prajñ›p›ramit› has four arms, with her first lefthand holding a text, her first right hand raising a flaming sword, and the remain-ing two being in the gesture of meditation. Together, these represent the threetypes of prajñ›: knowledge through study, cutting through and illuminatingdelusion, and direct realization of the true nature of all phenomena. These are alsocalled the prajñ›s through study, reflection, and meditation. MañjuŸrı also holdsa wisdom sword in his right hand and usually a lotus flower with a text on it inhis left hand. The book stands for knowledge that comes from letters and instruc-tions, while the lotus symbolizes the natural unfolding of our inner seed of prajñ›.Instead of the flower and the book, sometimes MañjuŸrı is depicted holding a vasecontaining the nectar of prajñ›. Here the sword indicates the active aspect andthe sharpness of prajñ›, while the nectar symbolizes its quality of intuitive insightinto true reality.Prajñ› may show in knowing and distinguishing ordinary things in the worldor in realizing the true nature of the mind by gradually progessing on the Bud-dhist path. Accordingly, its most basic classification is into mundane knowledgeand supramundane knowledge.Mundane knowledge in general refers to all empirical, scientific, and artisticknowledge that is not specifically related to the Buddhist “science of mind,” thatis, everything that we may learn in our lives, whether at home, at school, in pro-fessional training, or at universities, such as the humanities, the natural sciences,or arts and crafts. Traditionally, it refers to the “four major and five minor com-mon sciences” of Indo-Tibetan culture.416Supramundane knowledge stands for all knowledge, insights, and spiritual real-izations in the context of Buddhism as the fifth major science, which is the uncom-mon inner science of the mind. For the main objective of these teachings is to gobeyond the world of cyclic existence. Such knowledge may again be classified asa) lesser supramundane knowledge and b) great supramundane knowledge.Lesser supramundane knowledge encompasses the knowledge that arises fromstudy, reflection, and meditation in the vehicles of hearers and solitary realizers,such as realizing the four realities of the noble ones and personal identitylessness.Great supramundane knowledge results from study, reflection, and meditationwithin the great vehicle of bodhisattvas, such as realizing that all phenomena areunarisen and empty of an inherent nature of their own. As The Prajñ›p›ramit›SÒtra in Seven Hundred Lines417says:144The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 144"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Knowledge is that which realizes that all phenomena are unarisen.AtıŸa’s Lamp for the Path to Enlightenmentstates:Knowledge is comprehensively explainedAs that which realizes that aggregates,Constituents, and sources are unbornAnd empty of a nature of their own.418Thus, among all these types of knowledge, the Centrist teachings prima-rily deal with the great supramundane knowledge. This knowledge is devel-oped during the three phases of studying, reflecting, and meditating on theprofound and vast topics of the great vehicle, so the three types of knowledgethat are gained through study, reflection, and meditation are distinguished.Among these three, the first two can only be conceptual in nature, while thelatter may be either conceptual or nonconceptual. During the first two of thefive paths of the great vehicle—the path of accumulation and the path ofjunction—the knowledge through meditation is still conceptual, though itsconceptuality becomes increasingly refined and subtle. During the medita-tive equipoises of the paths of seeing and meditation, this knowledge is exclu-sively nonconceptual, since it directly realizes the nature of all phenomenawithout any mental reference points. During the phases of subsequent attain-ment on these paths, however, there are still traces of conceptuality in bodhi-sattvas. As for the omniscient knowledge of a Buddha on the path of nomore learning, it is always nonconceptual and free from reference points,since it is the constant and panoramic awareness of the nature of all phe-nomena and does not involve any shift between meditative equipoise andsubsequent attainment. This knowledge of a Buddha and the knowledge ofbodhisattvas during their meditative equipoises are what is called wisdom orthe perfection of knowledge in the strict sense. In general, in the Prajñ› -p›ramit› sÒtras, there are three main ways in which the term “perfection ofknowledge” is used. Dign›ga’s Summary of Prajñ›p›ramit›says:The perfection of knowledge is nondual wisdom,Which is the Thus-Gone One.[Its] texts and the path [bear] its name,Since they are associated with this actuality to be accomplished.419The Eighth Karmapa’s commentary on The Ornament of Clear Realizationelab-orates:The Middle from Beginning to End 145Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 145"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"(1) The definition of the perfection of knowledge: Suchness that is neversomething other and bears the name “wisdom which lacks the dualityof apprehender and apprehended.” This is [also called] the natural per-fection of knowledge, which is classified as two:(a) When suchness is obscured by various formational elements, it isthe basic element, the Heart of the Blissfully Gone Ones. [This iscalled the causal perfection of knowledge.](b) When this fundamental state itself is free from entanglement—theimpregnations of negativity—it is the result, the Dharma Body. [Thisis called the resultant perfection of knowledge.](2) The definition of the scriptural perfection of knowledge: [All expres-sions of] the mind that appear as assemblies of names, words, and let-ters and are suitable to be observed by the disciples’ consciousnesseswhich entail dualistic appearances.(3) The definition of the perfection of knowledge of the path: The per-fection of knowledge that arises as the nature of nonconceptual wis-dom when settling in meditative equipoise.420WisdomAs these quotes and Centrist texts in general show, there is a very close connec-tion between knowledge (prajñ›) and wisdom (jñ›na). Often, these terms aresimply used as synonyms, or it is said that wisdom is nothing but the culmina-tion or perfection of knowledge, prajñ›p›ramit›. In general, however, knowl-edge stands more for the analytical and discriminating aspect of superior insightand realization (both conceptual and nonconceptual), while wisdom mainlyemphasizes the nonconceptual, immediate, and panoramic aspects of realization.When talking specifically about the wisdom in the meditative equipoise of bodhi-sattvas and the wisdom of Buddhas, the sÒtras and the Centrist texts often use theterm “nonconceptual wisdom,” which indicates the wisdom that is the directyogic perception of the nature of phenomena and thus is free from all mental ref-erence points and conceptual projections. One also finds the expression “nondualwisdom,” which emphasizes the complete lack of any duality of a perceiving sub-ject (wisdom) that is different from its perceived object (ultimate reality). Asnoted before, “personally experienced wisdom” means that emptiness or thenature of the mind can be realized only within the individual meditative equipoiseof yogic practitioners through the practitioner’s own wisdom that constitutesthis meditative equipoise, and not through anything else. Thus, here, “personalexperience” does not refer to the usual kind of self-awareness in ordinary beings,146The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 146"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"such as one’s own mind experiencing one’s own happiness or suffering. Rather,it is the most sublime expression of the principle that mind is able to be aware ofitself without the duality of subject and object. This means that the nondual,nonconceptual wisdom in meditative equipoise is aware of its own nature, whichis nothing but the lack of any nature. Therefore, it is also called “the awarenessof the lack of nature.” Candrakırti says in his Lucid Words:The ultimate is not known due to something other. It is peace. It iswhat the noble ones are aware of as that which is to be personally expe-rienced [by them]. . . . This is not consciousness.421Once stainless nondual wisdom has been manifested . . . through thepower of personal realization . . . , one will be released.422His autocommentary on The Entrance into Centrismstates:The ultimate of the Buddhas . . . is ultimate reality by virtue of itsvery undeceptiveness. Still, all of them have to personally experienceit on their own.423The ultimate reality of all phenomena is that they are primordially empty,without nature, and identityless. So ultimately, all phenomena are completelypure and at peace. However, this mere fact does not help anybody who suffersbecause of not realizing it. For example, in its nature, the gold in gold ore isalways completely pure and unaffected by all the dross around it. However, thispure nature of gold does not become manifest and useful for people as long as theelements that cover it are not removed through processing the ore. Likewise, thetrue nature of the mind of all sentient beings is primordially pure and at peace,but since they take phenomena to be real, they suffer. Consequently, they haveto go through the gradual process of realizing and familiarizing themselves withultimate reality in order to finally experience its benefit of releasing them fromsuffering. In this way, all the many teachings and methods that the Buddhataught are meant for those who do not realize their true nature. As The SÒtra ofthe Ornament of Wisdom Light That Engages the Object of All Buddhas424says:The explanations about the connections between causes and conditionsAnd the teachings on gradual engagementWere spoken as means for the ignorant.What gradual training could there beIn this spontaneously present dharma?The Middle from Beginning to End 147Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 147"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The SÒtra Requested by Sky Treasure425states:As long as we have not fused with the ocean of the expanse of dharmas,there surely are different grounds and paths, but once we have fusedwith this ocean of the expanse of dharmas, there are not in the slight-est any grounds and paths to be traveled.When one thinks of Centrist reasoning, one might wonder how a conceptualreasoning consciousness could ever give rise to nonconceptual wisdom, sincethese two types of mind seem so contrary. The classic analogy for this is that ifone rubs two sticks against each other, heat is produced that eventually results infire. The fire burns the two sticks and then dies itself. In the same way, all the wayup to the last moment of the path of junction, in our reflection and meditation,we rub the two sticks of the factors to be relinquished and the remedies againsteach other. This increasingly subtle conceptual activity produces the heat that isan early sign of the actual fire of nonconceptual wisdom on the path of seeing,when the nature of phenomena is directly seen for the first time. When this lumi-nous wisdom blazes forth, both the factors to be relinquished and their remediesmelt away. All dullness and all agitation are also outshone. However, once allconceptual firewood is burned, the fire of wisdom does not literally die. Rather,the analogy points out that wisdom is not established as anything separate fromthe open and luminous nature of the mind and just naturally settles within thisnature. As AtıŸa says in his Centrist Pith Instructions:For example, if you rub two sticks [against each other], fire comesforth. Through this condition, the two sticks are burned and becomenonexistent. Thereafter, the fire that has burned them also subsides byitself. Likewise, once all specifically characterized and generally char-acterized phenomena are established as nonexistent [through knowl-edge], this knowledge itself is without appearance, luminous, and notestablished as any nature whatsoever. Thus, all flaws, such as dullnessand agitation, are eliminated. In this interval, consciousness is withoutany thought, does not apprehend anything, and has left behind allmindfulness and mental engagement. For as long as neither charac-teristics nor the enemies and robbers of thoughts arise, consciousnessshould rest in such a [state].426Thus, although the sticks and the fire are different, when rubbed against eachother, the sticks have the capacity to give rise to the fire. Likewise, both ourwrong ideas and their remedies appear to be different from nonconceptual wis-dom, but when we work on our mistaken notions through Centrist reasoning,148The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 148"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"there is definitely the chance that this will make wisdom shine forth. Another wayto put this is that conceptual thinking—by overheating, so to speak, in theprocess of reasoned analysis—is potentially self-dissolving. Thus, it has its ordi-nary quality of being discursive and referential, but it also has a liberating qual-ity of acute sharpness. In a way, it is a matter of how we direct and use its energy.For example, a soft, diffuse light does not illuminate very much, and its glaremight even blind us and prevent us from seeing things clearly. However, if thislight is concentrated into a laser beam, it is very sharp and penetrating, and wecan use it for a lot of purposes, such as cutting hard materials, running sophisti-cated technical equipment, and heating up things.When we look at this conceptual reasoning process and how it might turninto the nonconceptual wisdom that realizes its own nature, in terms of the basicexperience of our mind, there is neither a gradual process of transformation nora sudden transmutation of conceptual thinking into direct experience. To pro-gressively negate all our mistaken reference points—to see clearly that none ofthem exists—is in effect only to work on the direct experience of our mind all thetime. For example, we might mistakenly see three dangerous appearances in thetwilight, such as a snake, a bear, and a robber. To us, it seems as if we then expe-rience three different kinds of fear and must find out how to get away fromthese threats. But if we take a closer look, we might first see that the snake is actu-ally a long tree root, and we can recover some of our breath. Next, we dare toinvestigate the bear and see that it is a big rock with a bearlike shape. We alreadyfeel much better. Finally, checking on the robber, we find only an old scarecrowbeside the road. In the end, both our false reference points and the misconcep-tions about them have dissolved and our mind can fully relax, since there is noth-ing to grasp at and nothing that grasps at something. All three false objects andour subjective experiences of them have dissolved. However, what is left is not justnothing, but throughout this process, there is first the experience of all of thishappening in our mind and then the basic experience of this very mind relaxing.Likewise, in the reasoning process, our subjective mind gradually lets go ofholding on to its nonexistent reference points once it acknowledges their nonex-istence. The more our mind lets go of its reference points on the object side, thefewer reference points there are on the subject side; that is, there is less and weakergrasping at objects. Clearly, all this is not merely a conceptual operation in whichone concept simply cancels out another; the subjective process of letting go isdirectly experienced in our mind and makes it more relaxed. Once our mind isstripped of all reference points—both objective and subjective—the very experi-ence of a most fundamental relaxation does not dissolve with them. Rather, thisis precisely the peaceful experience of the nature of our mind resting at easewithin itself, since there are neither any reference points nor something that cre-ates such reference points. Having progressed through the ten grounds of bodhi-The Middle from Beginning to End 149Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 149"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"sattvas in this way, the various expressions of nonconceptual dualistic types ofconsciousness will gradually subside too. Finally, when all fluctuations of mindand mental events have ebbed away, this is called Buddhahood. As Candrakırtisays in his Entrance into Centrism:The dry firewood of knowable objects having been burned entirely,This peace is the Dharma Body of the Victors.At this point, there is neither arising nor cessation.The cessation of mind is revealed through this Body.427His autocommentary explains:In this Body that has the nature of wisdom and [in which] the dryfirewood of knowable objects has been burned entirely, there is noarising of knowable objects. Therefore, that which entails such nonar-ising is the Dharma Body of the Buddhas. Thus, the object of wis-dom—true reality—is in no case engaged by the [corresponding]subjects of such [knowable objects], that is, mind and mental events.Therefore, on the seeming level, this is expressed as [true reality] beingrevealed through this very Body.428The Eighth Karmapa elaborates:This “cessation of mind and mental events” does not mean that some-thing that has existed before up through the end of the continuum ofthe tenth ground [of bodhisattvas] has become nonexistent [now]. Thereasons for this are as follows: If it were like that, this would representthe extremes of permanence and extinction. If something [really]existed before, it is impossible that it could become nonexistent later.It is also not justified that what is primordially nonexistent becomesnonexistent later. Therefore, here, it is just the dissolution of all cling-ing of mind and mental events, or the vanishing of the mistakenappearances of fundamental unawareness, that is conventionallylabeled as cessation.429This process does not change or transform the true nature of our mind. Noris this nature produced from or arising from something else, such as our con-ceptual reasoning consciousness. Rather, what obscures this fundamentalnature—afflictive and cognitive obscurations—has been removed in its entirety.Thus, the primordial unity of expanse and basic awareness can just be clearly asit is. However, strictly speaking, there is nothing to be removed and nothing to150The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 150"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"be added. The only thing that happens is that mind lets go of its grasping at ref-erence points that never existed in the first place and lets this grasping melt backinto its own true nature. This is similar to when powerful waves produce thickfoam on the surface of the ocean and thus seem to obscure it. However, we donot have to skim off the foam in order to “uncover” the ocean, since the wavesand the foam are parts of the ocean and have the same nature. All we have to “do”is just let the waves and the foam naturally subside into the ocean, which basi-cally means not to interfere with this process by further stirring up the ocean.Likewise, in principle, the Buddhist path simply means letting our grasping—which is part of our mind and has the same nature—settle into its own empty andluminous nature. In practice, there are a variety of methods on different levels ofhow to let this happen, and the perfection of knowledge through the Centristapproach is one of them. As both The Ornament of Clear Realizationand TheSublime Continuumsay:There is nothing to be removed from itAnd not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is to be seen as it really is—Who sees actual reality is released.430The Benefit of the Perfection of KnowledgeThe perfection of knowledge or wisdom stands for directly encountering thehighest objective of bodhisattvas—ultimate reality—and thus is the main high-way to liberation and omniscience. Therefore, to be immersed in such wisdomis explained as the supreme of all practices and realizations. This is why its qual-ities as well as its profound and far-reaching impact on our minds cannot beoverestimated and are repeatedly praised in the scriptures. It is declared that torest for a single moment within the perfection of knowledge is of far greater meritthan—and actually includes—all other perfections, such as generosity. As TheSÒtra of the Meditative Concentration of the Vajra431says:If one does not move away from emptiness,The six perfections are assembled.The SÒtra Requested by Brahm›viŸe ̋acintideclares:Not reflecting is generosity.Not abiding in any difference is ethics.Not making any distinctions is patience.Not adopting or rejecting anything is vigor.The Middle from Beginning to End 151Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 151"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Not being attached is meditative stability.Not conceptualizing is knowledge.Likewise, it is stated that to abide in prajñ›p›ramit› is far superior to any stud-ies, reflections, or other meditations on the dharma, even if these are performedfor many eons. It is also the supreme way of making offerings, taking refuge inthe three jewels, generating the mind of enlightenment, and purifying all nega-tivities.The sÒtras and such texts as Maitreya’s Ornament of Clear Realizationdescribemany signs that indicate increasing familiarity and ease with the perfection ofknowledge. To summarize, one is able to see much more clearly in any situationand to deal more carefully with both oneself and others. One mindfully engagesin positive actions, and afflictions become weaker. Compassion for sentientbeings naturally develops, the dharma is practiced wholeheartedly, and distrac-tions are relinquished. Clinging in general is reduced, particularly the attach-ment to this life.There remains the question of how compassion can unfold from the realizationof emptiness or from the realization that there is no self. It is the very nature of com-passion not to arise on the basis of thinking in terms of ourselves. Rather, it is onlyto the degree that we gradually let go of concern for ourselves that there is more andmore space for compassion to naturally blossom. When all clinging to a personalself and the entire notion of “me and mine” has vanished, all the mental energy thatwe spent to uphold this illusory reference point is set free. The mental potentialdoes not just disappear, but, having lost its internal mistaken focus of a self, it nat-urally radiates out to all other beings who are still tied down to their little selves,thus suffering. Once the emptiness of all phenomena and beings is realized, noteven a subtle reference point—such as beings who are closer or more distant—isleft on which this radiant, unbiased compassion could become stuck or by whichit could be inhibited. It is in this way that the realization of identitylessness andemptiness paves the way for all-encompassing and inexhaustible compassion. Thenthe term “selflessness” can be used in a doubly meaningful way: Being self-less,one cannot but be “selfless,” or unselfish, in the best sense of the word.Technically, there are three types of compassion:1) the compassion that has all sentient beings as its reference point2) the compassion that has the dharma (or phenomena) as its reference point3) nonreferential compassionThe first type corresponds to the compassion of ordinary beings and is notinformed by any realization of impermanence or identitylessness. The second isinformed by the knowledge of realizing impermanence. This means that, through152The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 152"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"meditation on the four realities of the noble ones as well as cause and result, themind turns away from taking things to be lasting and solidly existent. When onesees that other beings suffer because they lack this realization and helplessly clingto things as being permanent, compassion for them arises. The third type unfoldsthrough directly realizing the emptiness or identitylessness of all phenomena.The Eighth Karmapa explains that all three types of compassion equally expressthemselves in the wish that sentient beings be free from suffering. In terms of theirdifferences, the first compassion is connected to the superimposition that sentientbeings or persons exist in some substantial way, thus taking such sentient beingsas its reference point. The second is connected to the realization that sentientbeings do not exist in a substantial way. However, mere phenomena, such as thefive aggregates, are still labeled as sentient beings and taken as the reference pointfor compassion. The third type springs from the realization that both persons andphenomena are identityless and thus merely labels their very lack of nature as“sentient beings.”Think of a pressure cooker on the stove with the lid on tight, filled with boil-ing water and highly energetic steam painful to touch. There is no place for thisenergy to go other than to boil away and dissolve everything inside the cooker. Ifwe try to open the lid slowly, without having read the instruction manual, somesteam will hiss out of the cooker and might frighten or burn us, and we will try totighten the lid again. Once we have read the manual and remove the lid properly,the steam spreads throughout our kitchen and condenses on the windows andwalls. If we open the pot outdoors, all the steam naturally spreads into space. As itcools, it may become part of a cloud, moisten the plants, provide water to drink,and so on. In the same way, trapped by the airtight lid of ego-clinging and reifi-cation, the natural display of the energy of our mind lacks the quality of spacious-ness and just gets uptight and self-destructive. Experiencing a little bit of ordinarycompassion may be possible, but it may quickly prove to be too overwhelming orfrightening. Having worked with our minds through studying and practicing theinstruction manuals of the dharma, the process of “pressure release” for our men-tal energy becomes more natural, but it still tends to condense on the referencepoints of those whom we like and burn those whom we do not like. Without suchreference points, the moistening warmth of the open and compassionate nature ofour mind naturally radiates and intelligently benefits others in many ways.TMadhyamaka PathTraditionally, the paths in all Buddhist schools or vehicles are presented as three-fold—study, reflection, and meditation—or fourfold if we add conduct to thelist. The relation between study, reflection, and meditation was highlighted in theThe Middle from Beginning to End 153Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 153"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"introduction, so an example by The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche of how theyrepresent an interconnected process may suffice here. He compares this processto baking chocolate chip cookies. First, we have to read a recipe for such cook-ies in a cookbook to see what the ingredients are and get an overview of the pro-cedure. This obviously corresponds to the phase of study on the Buddhist path.Next, we make a shopping list and buy all the necessary ingredients. Now we canbegin actually preparing the dough, heating up the oven, and so on. Dependingon how well we have studied the recipe, we can do this from memory or wemight have to consult our book from time to time. Once the cookies are in theoven, we will soon start to smell their appetizing scent. Thus, we arrive at the firstdirect experience that results from our efforts. At this point, the cookies are nolonger just some letters in a book but are about to become delicious food that isa part of our immediate experience. All of this corresponds to the phase of reflec-tion, in which we actively process the things that we have studied and gain somepersonal experience of them. Finally, the cookies are finished and we can eatthem. To relish and assimilate this product means that the actual cookies aredirectly experienced and become a part of our body. This is the phase of medi-tation, during which we gradually experience and integrate our studies and reflec-tions into our whole being. This analogy is quite fitting, as the original meaningof the Sanskrit term for meditation—bh›van›—is one of scent fully pervadingsomething like a cloth and actually becoming inseparable from it. In the sameway, one might say that we “perfume” our mind stream with liberating insights.Obviously, the baking process and the resultant quality of the cookies willdepend on how well we have followed the recipe. We will be able to enjoy theresult of this process—the cookies—only by doing everything properly. Like-wise, the efficacy of our reflection depends on how extensively and well we havestudied the relevant materials. Consequently, our meditation practice is subjectto the certainty that we have gained through systematic reflection. This does notmean that we should exclusively study for many years, then only reflect on all thisfor even longer, and then finally—if we are still alive—meditate. Rather, Gam-popa said that the best way to practice is to do all three steps in an integratedmanner: to study a topic, reflect and meditate on it, and then go on to the nexttopic. Also, Buddhist study should not be approached like a school curriculumin which various topics are studied just so they can be crossed off the list and arenever looked at again. Since Buddhist study and practice are meant to changesome of our most ingrained habits, they need to be personally worked on andintegrated into our whole being. Thus, they are necessarily processes that involverepetition and training until these things become natural and effortless, much asone learns to play an instrument. Processing the same issues again and againenables us to discover new and larger perspectives and understandings each time.This is also the point where conduct comes into play, since conduct in Bud-154The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 154"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"dhism basically means taking the insights and experiences that we gained duringthe more formal phases of studying, reflecting, and meditating and applyingthem to our daily lives. In summary, such Buddhist rehearsal has the effect ofbringing us to increasingly deep levels of experience and realization.Especially in Centrism, the path also means gradually letting go of both theproblems and their respective remedies. As stated earlier, the many volumes of thePrajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasand Centrist texts can be epitomized by the following twopoints: (1) Motivated by the altruistic attitude of the mind of enlightenment forthe sake of all beings, bodhisattvas make every effort to attain the omniscience ofa Buddha that is accomplished through practicing the six perfections. (2) Thereare no such things as bodhisattvas, omniscience, Buddhas, beings, the six per-fections, or any attainment. To integrate these two aspects in Buddhist practiceis called the unity of means and knowledge, or the unity of the seeming and theultimate mind of enlightenment. The training in the illusionlike means to accom-plish the benefit of oneself and others is constantly informed by the knowledgethat realizes the empty nature of all phenomena. Thus, motivated by great com-passion, the dreamlike accumulations of merit and wisdom that are contained inthe perfections are gathered.The framework for the actual practice on the Centrist path is threefold: prepa-ration, main practice, and conclusion. Every practice starts with bringing to mindour basic motivation for engaging in this path. First, we take refuge in the threejewels: the Buddha, his teachings, and the community of those who practice theseteachings. To take refuge in the Buddha does not mean to supplicate some otherperson for help. Rather, we appreciate the qualities of Buddhahood as the supremestate of liberation and omniscience that is the true nature of our mind and thusstrengthen our resolve to accomplish this state ourselves. Taking refuge in thedharma indicates our determination to actually apply the means that enable us toattain Buddhahood. To take refuge in the community of the practitioners of thesemethods means to open up to our spiritual friends who help us during this jour-ney and to be ready ourselves to help others who travel with us. Next, we affirmour aspiring mind of enlightenment, our wish to perform all our Buddhist prac-tices not just for our own liberation but for the sake of accomplishing perfectBuddhahood for the welfare of all sentient beings. Seen in this way, Buddhahoodbecomes a sort of by-product of gradually “forgetting” ourselves on the path of abodhisattva by increasingly focusing on the needs of others. In fact, it is impos-sible and a contradiction in terms to attain Buddhahood for oneself or by oneself.All of the main practices are contained in the applied mind of enlightenment,that is, the actual engagement in the six perfections. In general, the first five per-fections—generosity up through meditative stability—are considered the means,also called the accumulation of merit. The sixth perfection—knowledge—rep-resents the accumulation of wisdom. However, the crucial point on the CentristThe Middle from Beginning to End 155Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 155"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"path is to practice wisdom and means as a unity, since this is the only way toattain the great “nonabiding nirv› ̊a.” Through supreme knowledge, Buddhasand bodhisattvas are not stuck in the extreme of cyclic existence. Through com-passion, they are also not just resting in—or limited to—the one-sided nirvanicpeace of arhats merely for their own benefit. Thus, through uniting compassionand knowledge, bodhisattvas appear in the world without being in the world. Asfor such unified practice, it is solely through being inseparably linked with thewisdom of realizing the nature of phenomena—emptiness—that all the perfec-tions become truly supramundane perfections. Only then can they serve as thegenuine means for liberation and perfect Buddhahood. Strictly speaking, this ispossible only for practitioners on the ten bodhisattva grounds, since they havedirectly realized the nature of phenomena. However, to some extent, ordinarybeings also can—and actually are supposed to—train in the methods to make theperfections supramundane. There are three steps or means to “perfect the per-fections”:1) They are enhanced through wisdom.2) They are expanded through knowledge.3) They are made limitless through dedication.Enhancing the perfections through wisdom refers to not fixating on the threespheres, that is, an agent, its object, and the action itself. To take the perfectionof generosity as an example, this means that we practice it with the constantawareness that the giver, the recipient, and the act of giving are all illusionlike andempty of a real nature.The positive impact, or the meritorious power, of the perfections is expandedthrough knowledge. This is again threefold: First, as for generosity, we practiceit not just for the sake of some temporary, limited benefit or relief but—no mat-ter how modest our act of giving may be—always with the supreme motivationthat this generosity may be a cause for all beings to attain enlightenment. Second,we do not cling in any way to what we give, which is again based on not takingit to be real in any way. Finally, we do not entertain any hopes or expectationsabout the personal karmic rewards of our generosity.Dedication is the third means to perfect the perfections, and it is also the con-clusion of every practice. When all positive activities on the path are dedicatedfor the welfare and enlightenment of all sentient beings, these activities becomeinexhaustible, just as a drop of water that falls into the ocean does not get lost orexhausted. The supreme way of dedicating does not refer to any dedicator, anybeings to whom we dedicate, or any act of dedicating. Since true bodhisattvas per-form all their practices exclusively for the sake of all other beings, they have noproblem in passing on the benefit of whatever positive actions they commit. For156The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 156"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"them, dedication is an expression of their all-encompassing activity for others.Moreover, not keeping anything for ourselves directly works on our clinging to“I” and “mine,” and by letting go of all our accomplishments, we avoid makingthem into just another—more sophisticated—hang-up, such as making them asource of pride.How Can Madhyamaka Be a Personal Practice?Before we get into the excruciating intricacies of Centrist reasoning, a short sketchmay be useful to convey an idea of how Centrist practice, which includes rea-soning, may serve as a practical and transformative path that is very relevant toour personal issues and problems, which often may seem so different from whatCentrists address. One of the main problems that arise when we encounter Cen-trist reasonings is that the classical texts mostly presented them in terms of “how”rather than “why.” They may appear as a kind of extremely sophisticated tool kitthat we can use to pulverize all kinds of views, if we are so interested, but oftenthere is little background information on why we should ever dive into suchcomplicated argumentations to accomplish this. If any explanations are offeredabout what the point of this logical overkill may be, they are usually very briefand/or highly technical. Moreover, as for our own worldview, often we do notthink we hold any of the views that the Centrists are refuting. Nor do we feel anyrelation to these ancient people and schools that supposedly maintained suchpositions many hundreds of years ago in India or Tibet. So why even start to pur-sue endless chains of complicated reasonings that deal with problems that arenot ours and address people whom we do not know?Now, when we go to a pharmacy, we usually know what our problem is andthen select the appropriate medicine for it; we do not consume the entire assort-ment of drugs. Likewise, we do not go to our physician for help when we haveno specific health problem, nor do we want the doctor to put us through everyavailable high-tech diagnostic procedure or prescribe many different pills thatwe do not need. We definitely prefer to have just our present problem treated.In a similar way, Centrist texts are like well-stocked pharmacies and Centristmasters are like well-equipped physicians, so the issues described equally apply tothe treatment of the Madhyamaka type. First—and this is so self-evident that we usually do not even consider it—wehave to decide that we have a problem that needs treatment. If such is the case,we must then identify our individual problem as clearly as possible. There is nopoint in using any medical or Madhyamaka treatment, if we have no problem orin just applying the treatment to some pseudo-problem. Finally, we have to treatour problem with the specifically appropriate methods. In principle, Centristtexts can help us with all three points, since they keep telling us that we do haveThe Middle from Beginning to End 157Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 157"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"a problem, even if we are not aware of it (whether this message rings true for usis of course entirely up to us). The scriptures also clearly identify the basic prob-lem of existence and its ramifications and present a rich variety of remedies. Thus,rather than just plunging into the middle of all kinds of treatments for all kindsof problems, we should be aware of these issues in order to find out which treat-ment really addresses our own problem.In general, there are many reasons for engaging in philosophy, but to my knowl-edge—at least in the West—no philosophers have ever expressed that the funda-mental reason for presenting their system is to liberate all sentient beings from theirsuffering.432To some degree, Plato in his final statement in the famous cave dia-logue may be an exception. To be sure, I do not intend to present an overview ofWestern philosophy here, nor do I deny its value. I am just trying to contrast theMadhyamaka approach with the overall approach of classical Western philoso-phy. If this is too generalized or oversimplified, may the educated philosophers for-give me. Aristotle (384–322 bce)defined philosophy as the teaching about the firstcause and reason. In this sense, philosophy is the search for the initial cause of, orreasons for, what is. It is an attempt to describe or explain the world and our ownplace in it as coherently as possible and in a way that is assumed to be the way thatthe world—and what lies beyond it—really is. In this process, such disciplines aslogic, ontology, epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics are employed as means toestablish one’s own worldview and question those of others. On the subjectivelevel, this involves solidifying and reifying one’s notions by trying to establish—or just taking for granted—that there is a connection between these notions andsomething to which they refer. In particular contrast to Buddhism, the issue of apersonal self is usually tacitly considered a given (one of the very few exceptionsis in the writings of David Hume). As exemplified by Descartes’s famous sentence“I think, therefore I am,” exactly what this “I” might be is hardly ever questioned.Moreover, as the familiar phrase of “the ivory tower of philosophy” indicates,Western philosophies often remain quite theoretical edifices that offer little prac-tical instruction in how to apply them to our daily problems. Or, as in some mod-ern deconstructive philosophies, we may be left with some kind of “sophisticated”nihilism after having rejected all positivistic philosophical engagement. Some “edi-fying” philosophers like Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and Dewey seem to have turnedaway from these tendencies and, as Rorty says, aim “to help their readers, or soci-ety as a whole, break free from outworn vocabularies and attitudes, rather than toprovide `grounding’ for the intuitions and the customs of the present.”433As was stated before, Centrist masters like N›g›rjuna, Candrakırti, and⁄›ntideva all clearly agree on their “mission.” Their purpose in working withothers lies at the heart of what Buddhism is. It is not some theoretical philoso-phy or metaphysical speculation but a practical system of gradual mind trainingin order to release sentient beings from suffering. Its intention is to fully realize158The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 158"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"the true nature of mind, which in itself is beyond the problem of suffering andany of its remedies. Thus, for these masters, their teachings are just tools that theyemploy out of compassion to help others realize what they realized themselves.Centrists simply do not care about philosophy in the usual sense, or about suchthings as logic, reasoning, ontology, epistemology, phenomenology, and meta-physics per se. If one of these topics comes into play at some point in their teach-ings, it is only insofar as it may be suitable to serve the purpose of a provisionaldevice for their liberating activity. As Centrist analysis shows, it is exclusivelywithin the essentially mistaken perspective of deluded beings and their conven-tional communications that logic, reasoning, and such can be applied as tools togo beyond this framework.Therefore, the point of engaging in Madhyamaka is not at all to create justanother system of philosophy that claims to accurately describe the final pictureof the world. We have more than enough ideas about all kinds of things, which,—from the Madhyamaka point of view, is precisely the problem. Rather, it is amatter of letting go of our solidifying notions of the world and not building upeven more sophisticated ones. In Madhyamaka, no effort is made to establish anyontology. As was explained earlier, the two realities are not ontological categories,since seeming reality is just the illusion that appears to the mistaken minds ofordinary sentient beings. Ultimate reality is explicitly said to defy any descriptionor accessibility through samsaric mental states and thus also any ontological ascer-tainment. The two realities are not presented in order to establish an ultimatemode of existence (how reality “really” is) as opposed to a conventional mode ofexistence (how things seem to be). There is also no attempt to justify or establishanything within seeming reality, such as precisely how it is that karma—cause andeffect—works. The thrust of talking about the two realities is soteriological.Seeming reality is identified as the problem, that is, cyclic existence and its cause,which is basic unawareness. Ultimate reality is just the solution to this problem,not a new problem. Thus, to realize ultimate reality does not mean to substituteone thing with another, such as sa ̇s›ra with nirv› ̊a. This is very much likewhen an illness is cured. It is not that the thing “illness” is replaced by the thing“health.” Rather, it is just the removal of the causes of the illness that makes itssymptoms disappear, and this absence of symptoms is what is called health. Sowhen Centrists address seeming reality, it is only for pedagogical purposes inorder to cure samsaric illusion.In this way, Centrists use their tools quite dispassionately, as if they weremerely crutches offered to provide support until the patients—sentient beings—can finally walk alone. Nobody whose broken leg has healed would continue towalk on crutches, and nobody would bother to carry a boat forever once it hasreached the other shore of a river. In the same way, those who follow the Cen-trist approach have no use for their methods once they arrive on the other sideThe Middle from Beginning to End 159Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 159"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"of cyclic existence. Instead, the Centrists’ rigorous deconstructive analysis of anyphilosophy or thought system points beyond all of these systems, including Cen-trism itself. One could say that the Centrist approach has a built-in mechanismof self-destruction, since it not only eliminates other systems but eventually dis-solves itself by itself.In brief, if Madhyamaka were explained as a coherent philosophical, ontolog-ical, or logical system, it might appeal much more to our clinging to some neatlyorganized, all-explanatory picture of the world and our perception of it. We justwant to have something that makes good sense, in which all the parts fit together,something on which we can build our belief system. However, any attempt toforce Madhyamaka into any system at all must necessarily fail because of the verynature of what Madhyamaka is: the deconstruction of any system and concep-tualization whatsoever, including itself. If one were to reintroduce into Madh-yamaka any notion of an explanatory or justifying approach, one would simplyreestablish the very traps that this specific approach is designed to take apart.However, Centrists certainly do not go to such great lengths to deconstruct ourcomplex and mistaken mental processes merely to arrive at a big black hole ofnothing whatsoever. N›g›rjuna’s Commentary on the Mind of Enlightenmentsays:The mind is arrayed by latent tendencies.Freedom from latent tendencies is bliss.This blissful mind is peacefulness.A peaceful mind will not be ignorant.Not to be ignorant is the realization of true reality.The realization of true reality is the attainment of liberation.434The contemporary Kagyü meditation master and scholar Khenpo TsultrimGyamtso Rinpoche often gives the following example:In terms of the sky alone, there is no difference between the sky atnight and at day. But in order for rainbows to appear within the sky,there needs to be the quality of light or illumination. If there is justmere empty space with no illuminating quality, rainbows cannotappear. In the same way, blank emptiness cannot give rise to theappearances of sa ̇s›ra and nirv› ̊a. Here, space refers to the emptyessence of the mind, the light stands for mind’s luminous nature, andthe rainbows indicate its unimpeded way of manifestation.If we misunderstand emptiness as mere empty space without awareness, howcould this be a liberating realization or even Buddhahood with all its qualities?160The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 160"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Furthermore, it would be very difficult to inspire anybody to embark on a pathof hard work for all sentient beings for countless eons just to end up in somethinglike a vacuum. The path to arhathood—to be accomplished within a maximumof seven lifetimes—would certainly be the quicker and better option in that case.Thus, what is stripped away on the path is deluded superficial mental activity, butwe are surely not trying to get rid of the nature of our mind. The absence of sub-ject and object, of dualistic clinging, and of any reference point whatsoever doesnot mean that there is no awareness at all. Pawo Rinpoche comments:You might ask, “What kind of result comes from meditating on this?”All aspects of discrimination and observation as such and such arereversed. So one knows that there is no phenomenon whatsoever to beattained through anything, which extinguishes [all] hopes for nirv› ̊a.Just like knowing that a dream is a dream, one knows that suffering isnot observable through its nature. Thus, there is no fear of cyclic exis-tence. Apart from all phenomena just being mere imputations, theyneither abide as any nature whatsoever nor do they abide as anythingat all. Just that is what is seen as precisely this empty and luminousexpanse of mind. This puts you in the position where you have com-plete power over everything you could possibly wish for, just as if allphenomena were resting in the palm of your hand.435Practically speaking, Centrism tries to bring the dialogue that we have bothwith ourselves and others as far as a conceptual or verbal dialogue can possiblygo and then has us look for ourselves. The crucial issue here is this: Other thanjust being intellectual gymnastics, how could this dialogue affect our minds, oursubjective experience? From the point of view of personal Buddhist practice, theCentrist approach is not primarily about simply negating all kinds of objects. Interms of mental focus, negating objects is still a somewhat externally orientedconceptual mental activity, even when the object that is negated is one’s ownmind, that is, the perceiving subject. Negating should also not be understood asa kind of destruction, in the sense that what exists initially is later blown up byemptiness or reasoning. Rather, this approach is an increasingly refined processof just pointing out that none of these objects of negation—our fixed ideas—everexisted at all. Centrism is about facilitating the insight that there is nothing to allthat which we assume to exist in the first place.At the point of having negated everything in this way—even the negation andthe negator themselves—we are taught to cautiously shift our focus to the “inside.”Of course, strictly speaking, there is no focusing going on at this time and also noreference points of “inside” or “outside.” What this means is that our mind directlylooks at its own nature in that open space, at the experience of being stripped bareThe Middle from Beginning to End 161Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 161"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"of all clinging and conceptual constructions. What is seen then? Centrists do notgive us something to hold on to here—which is their whole point—but as thestatements above show, it is certainly not utterly blank nothingness or some kindof coma. It is nothing other than the perfection of knowledge, or prajñ›p›ramit›.This is called “personally experienced wisdom realizing the nature of phenom-ena.” It is also said to be the “Great Madhyamaka.”In functioning thus as a pointing-out method, Madhyamaka is not really dif-ferent from the pointing-out instructions in the Mah›mudr› or Dzogchenapproach and is indeed very similar to certain Zen methods. Of course, techni-cally speaking, the methods of pointing out might appear rather different in thesesystems, but what is pointed out is not different in terms of experience. This isamply documented by realized beings in these traditions as well as in such textsas the Eighth Karmapa’sChariot of the Tagbo Siddhas, Mipham Rinpoche’s Lampof Certainty,436and Düdjom Rinpoche’s The Nyingma School of Tibetan Bud-dhism. Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche commented on verse IX.34 of TheEntrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life:At this point, no other aspects except for the genuine object—thenature of phenomena free from discursiveness—appear for the mind.Therefore, also the perceiving subject—the knowledge that realizesemptiness—abides without any observing or apprehending, in a waythat is free from discursiveness. Within the natural state of the object(the nature of phenomena free from discursiveness), also the mind thatperceives this is nothing but the complete peace of all discursiveness.This situation is then conventionally called “realizing emptiness.”“Realizing” is just a conventional term, since here, there is nothing tobe realized and nothing that realizes, just like water poured into water.Sometimes one also speaks of emptiness as spaciousness, or openness,because it is free from discursiveness.On the experience of the expanse of dharmas, he explains:The expanse of dharmas in which the aggregates, the sources, and theconstituents display is open, spacious, and relaxed. Here, the conven-tional term “emptiness” is not used. What is described instead is theirnatural openness and spaciousness, the expanse of dharmadh›tu. Inorder to reverse our clinging to things as being real, we are taught interms of emptiness. In order to reverse our clinging to things as beingempty, we are taught in terms of the expanse of dharmas, the openness,spaciousness, and relaxedness of the dharmadh›tu.162The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 162"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Surely, emptiness understood as the free openness of mind’s own true space wasat least one aspect that Candrakırti had in mind when he said in his Entrance intoCentrism: Those in whom, even as ordinary beings, upon hearing of emptiness,Great joy wells up from within again and again,Whose eyes become moistened with tears born from that great joy,And whose hairs on the body stand on end—These persons bear the seed of a perfect Buddha’s insight.They are the vessels for the teaching on true reality,They should be taught ultimate reality,And it is they who possess the qualities associated with such.437In terms of our own experience, we can easily compare how we feel when wehear the word “empty” and when we hear “open, spacious, and relaxed.” Thus,we have to distinguish between the context of reasoned analysis and looking atour minds in a very direct way. In order to cut through our reference points andsuperimpositions through reasoning, it is helpful to talk about things being emptyof inherent nature, characteristics, or existence. In this context, “empty” refers toa negation, the absence of real existence or properties. As was said, actual ultimatereality is beyond existence and nonexistence or affirmation and negation. Wemight wonder then why Centrists always talk in negative terms, such as therebeing no arising and no ceasing. The reason is that we have a much strongerclinging to existence than to nonexistence. And even if we are nihilists and thinkthat nothing exists, there is still the more or less subtle, reifying notion that “noth-ing exists.” Hence, the danger of actually clinging to utter nonexistence is veryminor in comparison to the deeply ingrained tendency to take everything to beexistent. So it is in order to overcome this strong habit of clinging to existencethat Centrists keep pounding us with its opposite, the negation of existence.Once this fundamental grasping at existence is overcome, then all other kinds ofclinging to certain attributes of what we assume to exist will collapse naturally,just as it is pointless to ponder the color and shape of the horns of a rabbit or howto best construct a ladder out of them.However, in the context of practicing meditation on emptiness—when empti-ness is fundamentally understood as the richness of the nature of our mind—it isalso crucial to not reinforce our habitual poverty mentality when we hear the word“empty.” Particularly in experiential terms, it is important to see that when we talkabout emptiness, we are surely not talking about it in the negative sense of anempty room or an empty bottle but in the sense of spaciousness, openness, relax-ation, and letting go. This means no longer being confined by our own narrow,The Middle from Beginning to End 163Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 163"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"rigid mental framework. There is another traditional analogy for how to relieveourselves of fixation and grasping. How can we relieve the pain that is caused byclenching our own fist as hard as possible? Here, leading doctors do not recom-mend taking painkillers or amputating the hand. We just have to relax our fingers.In the same way, realizing emptiness has a lot to do with relaxing our clingingmind. It is not merely a matter of following a dry routine of technically negat-ing all the objects of clinging without ever being aware of what this does to themind that holds on to all these objects. It is crucial to be aware that the actual tar-get of Centrist analysis is not the objects that are refuted but this grasping mind,which—through its clinging to mistaken notions—is the cause of all suffering.However, it is extremely difficult to directly stop it from grasping and make itrelax. We cannot simply tell ourselves, “Well, just don’t cling.” This is why Cen-trism works at inducing certainty that there are no objects whatsoever that wouldjustify any of our clinging. When we realize that there are no objects for ourgrasping, we can finally relax and let go of self-inflicted pain.When Centrists say that everything is like a dream or an illusion, the point isnot just to establish the objective side of our experience to be illusory or dream-like but to see what effect this has on our mind as the subjective experiencer.Again, this is not at all to make an ontological statement about how things exist.Centrists do not really care whether things as such actually exist like illusions orin any other way. However, they are very interested in how we feel about andbehave toward illusionlike things as opposed to how we feel about and behavetoward solid, really existing phenomena. In his Treasury of Knowledge, JamgönKongtrul Lodrö Taye says:This is like the following example: The realization that it is the natureof space to be accommodating means that space itself has becomeinseparable from the mental state [that realizes this].438Usually, if we recognize that something is just a dream or an illusion, we do nottake it so seriously or fixate on it. It is easier to let go of a bad dream when we rec-ognize that it was just a dream. Being convinced about this makes us relax, whichis the aim of Centrist analysis. We learn to relax by becoming convinced that thesnake is merely a hose and, apart from our holding on to it, there never was anysnake out there, and there is no one in here who could be afraid of it either.This is also how we evaluate whether our own Centrist analysis has actuallybecome a mind-transforming practice or remains merely intellectual gymnastics.If our mind and the Centrist approach have mixed, we find ourselves morerelaxed in encountering the different situations of “real life.” If there is morespace in the way we experience and react to these situations, we do not immedi-ately look at people and things from our usual narrow, fixed perspectives, which164The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 164"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"habitually lead to equally rigid patterns of behavior. At the same time, we see thatapproaching the realization of emptiness does not mean that we become careless,indifferent, or depressed. Rather, such a development widens our perspective andour awareness of people and situations. It enriches our range of possible actionsand reactions in the direction of being more mindful, skillful, and compassion-ate, since we are less caught up in our own fixation and more free to see other peo-ple’s situations. This can surely be regarded as a first step on the path of realizingemptiness or complete openness. On the other hand, it is a serious error simplyto say, “Oh, it’s all just an illusion and empty” and not care about anything,especially the suffering of others. This is certainly not the result to be attainedthrough Centrist analysis. So if our genuine interest in other people and ourcompassion decrease, it is a sure sign that the dharma in general—and Madhya-maka as a personal practice in particular—has not blended with our experience,to say nothing of getting any closer to realizing emptiness.The process of personally working with Madhyamaka reasoning involves bothour wisdom and our ignorance. This can be very interesting and illuminatingand at the same time deeply disturbing. It may cause inner resistance to a degreethat is hardly expected. On the one hand, when properly applied, the Madhya-maka approach will sharpen and refine our discriminative awareness in a notice-able and broad way, enabling it to function in an increasingly encompassingmanner on various levels. This does not refer to just the intellectual realm but alsoextends into the fields of psychological, emotional, and meditative fine-tuning,which is to say that it is not just a matter of becoming more clever or witty. Thisprocess enables us to see more clearly through our fixations and hang-ups inmany respects and, as a result, gradually let go of them.On the other hand, engaging in such analysis exposes our basic and specificignorance in a very immediate and personal way, which at first might seem to bean unwanted side effect. Sometimes, one’s initial reaction to Madhyamaka is tofeel stupid or bewildered to the point of utter speechlessness. This shows thedeep impact that such an approach may have on our minds. More important, itprovides us with otherwise unknown opportunities to have access to the mostdirect and vivid experiences of the one mental affliction that we usually do notconsciously experience: our ignorance or unawareness. We all have plenty ofchances to clearly experience all the other afflictions—such as anger, desire, orpride—and are very familiar with them. Although Buddhists always speak ofignorance or basic unawareness as the root of cyclic existence, experientially, weoften do not really know what we are talking about here. Of course, we can beaware of our ignorance in the sense of not knowing how to fix our car or whereexactly New Guinea is. However, the powerful and profound ignorance that isat the heart of cyclic existence is not just a matter of being ignorant about somefacts. It is more the general tendency—on many levels—to be fundamentallyThe Middle from Beginning to End 165Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 165"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"unclear about the true nature of one’s mind, which leads to becoming caught upin all kinds of beliefs about ourselves and others. Such ignorance contains twoaspects: We may be passively ignorant in the sense of not being ableto look atourselves and what is going on in our minds, but we may also be actively ignor-ing things by not wantingto look at them and turning away.One of the characteristics of basic unawareness is that we are literally unawareof our unawareness. Of course, when we think about what unawareness is, itappears obvious that unawareness includes unawareness of itself. However, interms of our experience, it is precisely because we are unaware of our instinctiveand habitual blind spots that we have no idea that we have them; much less dowe face them and work on them. So when do we normally get a glimpse of this?Centrism provides us with the opportunity to gain firsthand insight into howdeeply rooted and pervasive our basic unawareness is. Moreover, it lays bare thevarious intricate layers of this unawareness. Often Centrist reasonings and textsseem overly complex, ramified, and repetitive. However, this is not at all thefault of this system. Centrism is complicated and repetitive only in response toour many layers of complicated concepts, unfounded beliefs, and convolutedtrains of thought, most of which are deeply ingrained. Therefore, Centrist textscannot but go into every little detail we could think of, and even into those thatwe would not think of. If the targets for Centrist reasoning were just simpleissues that are located on the easily accessible surface level of our minds, their dis-cussion could likewise be very simple and straightforward. Obviously, our abil-ity to differentiate and conceptually eliminate what is wrong is not strained whenwe are only talking about distinguishing tables from chairs. However, we mustcertainly exercise our discriminative capacity more powerfully when we try tounderstand subatomic particles and their interactions in quantum physics.Such discrimination is even more essential when we approach the ultimatenature of phenomena, which is beyond our usual range of cognitions. As wassaid, this is not an object of any of our present perceptions, such as seeing orhearing, and is also not an object of conceptual mind. So the approach here isbasically to refine our initially vague mental image of emptiness into an increas-ingly vivid notion by gradually eliminating everything that it is not. Emptinessis so subtle and elusive that the whole range of what needs to be negated in orderto define it clearly is not immediately apparent, and the process of conceptuallyrefining our understanding naturally requires many details. This conceptualrefinement is of course different from the final point of nonconceptual realiza-tion of emptiness, but we cannot reach the latter by simply trying to get rid ofthoughts. The Centrist approach enables us to strip away mistaken notions byfirst creating more “correct” ones and then gradually letting go of the correctones too, including the vivid notion of emptiness itself. We may also compare ourthoughts and our intellect to an axe that has to be sharpened before we can use166The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 166"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"it to cut down a tree obscuring the view from our window. Afterward, we can letgo of this axe, but if we throw it away right at the start and just wish for the treeto fall down by itself—or pretend it isn’t there at all—we get nowhere. Moreover,the process of refining our insight is not based on mere superficial reflection; itmust be deeply and repeatedly cultivated through meditation, that is, the unityof calm abiding and superior insight. There is no question that conceptual mindcan be a stepping-stone toward an immediate awareness that simply sees what is,without any conceptual distortion. Thus, we use our intellect in a systematic waythat eventually leads to its own exhaustion (which is surely also meant in a literalsense!) and gives way to a different perspective altogether: the natural outlook ofthe nature of our mind, which is neither tied up in thinking nor caught up inordinary sense perception.When we look at the seemingly endless and pointless repetitions of the samereasonings in Centrism, we may also understand them as remedies that poke atour awareness, which tends to fall asleep again and again, since our ingrainedtendencies instantly cover up much of what we might have detected about ourfixations the first or the second time. Centrists would surely prefer to make all ofthis much easier, but our discursive mental framework, with its billions of refer-ence points, forces them to relate to at least the main principles of mistakennesstherein. Many of our clingings and delusions are unconscious or so subtle thatwe do not even know we have them. However, they are to a large extent whatdetermines our thinking and our actions. Centrism brings all of our hang-ups tolight and at the same time provides the means to face and dissolve them. How-ever, we usually do not want to give in that quickly but desperately try to holdon to our beliefs, however unreasonable they might be. Thus, the reason Centristtexts are often wordy lies mainly in our multiple defense strategies, be they emo-tional or argumentative. In fact, if just once in a while we could remember to beaware of our unawareness—to look at some of our clinging instead of letting itsunderground work continue unnoticed—then that alone could remove a tremen-dous amount of mental dullness. Looking at this unawareness lifts some of theveils that this unawareness casts over the true nature of our mind but also overitself, which means that unawareness itself usually makes sure that we do notwant to look at it. And if we are forced to look at it, with unequaled skill it makesus swiftly turn away and escape.In this process, there is a definite chance for sudden openness, insight, and gapexperiences in the midst of reasoning, in the midst of a tornado of whirlingthoughts, and in the midst of the dullest states of mind. The crucial point hereis again what this analysis does to our minds and how we relate to the experiencesit brings up. Do we see more clearly? Do we experience more space? Are webecoming more relaxed?Another striking feature of Madhyamaka analysis is how much emotional resist-The Middle from Beginning to End 167Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 167"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"ance it can produce in us. Normally, we do not really want to get into all thesereasonings and deconstructions of concepts, and we find all kinds of wonderfulrationales for why this is pointless, counterproductive, too intellectual, and so on.The main reason we do this is that the more active part of our ignorance doesn’twant us to look at ourselves. We do not really wish to have our belief systemsquestioned, probably because we have some feeling that they might not be in suchperfect touch with reality as we like them to be. We like our little world as intactand secure as we can possibly make it, or at least pretend so. We actually enjoy ourtendency to lump together all kinds of—sometimes contradictory—ideas andbeliefs and call that sophisticated. Here, the Madhyamaka approach is actuallyquite down to earth. Centrists basically say, “Sure, in your mind you can think ofand define all kinds of things, but that does not turn any of them into somethingreal. So if you think that certain things really exist, you have to either directlyshow them to us or come up with some good proof for them. If you cannot doeither, then where are these things, other than just in your imagination?”We do not like other people poking around in our private little thoughts andour treasured ideas about ourselves and the world. Everybody or everything thatquestions them is immediately registered as a hostile threat to “Planet Ego,” andall our defense systems gear up. In this sense, the Madhyamaka system is PublicEnemy Number One in Egoland. It does precisely all of this repellent pryinginto our supposedly private business in a most unnerving and relentless way. Itmesses up the whole planet—nothing is like before. It even wipes out the defensesystems. It does not care about all these signs everywhere that clearly say “offlimits—private property—ego-clinging territory.” But Madhyamaka just walksstraight in and does not go along with our self-cherishing at all. It is as if there isa jumbled storage room in the basement of our mind in which we keep stashingour emotional and conceptual garbage. We try really hard not to look at thismess, let alone clean it up, but Madhyamaka picks up every single piece andholds it under our nose and says, “This thing goes out, and that does too, and allthe rest as well. Let’s get some space and fresh air in here.” It operates with a kindof merciless compassion that does not give up on us, no matter what kind ofclever excuses, tricky defenses, or outright escape techniques we might come upwith. Somehow it has this tendency to get under our skin and get us at somepoint, often in unexpected ways. It is like the worst self-unfolding computervirus that sneaks onto our well-protected hard drive of reification and, no mat-ter what we do, wrecks both the software and hardware that run our ego pro-grams, including all firewalls, before it dissolves itself. It affects us even—andmaybe most effectively—in the midst of our enormous efforts to ward it off.It can be overwhelming when we discover this and realize that Madhyamakaanalysis and reasoning is not just an intellectual game but can deeply affect us atthe basic level of our personal and emotional existence. Suddenly, we may find168The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 168"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"ourselves not only working with our various ways of clinging to ourselves and ourworld but also—and maybe even worse—facing our aversion and resistance to thevery remedy for that clinging. However, it is important to regard this not as anadditional difficulty but as an intrinsic and crucial constituent of the process ofapplying the Madhyamaka approach as a practice of personal transformation. Itis part of the game, so to speak, to acknowledge, look at, and work with ourinner resistance to Madhyamaka analysis at the very time we are engaged in it.There are, of course, other topics that we might be more willing to subject toanalysis and mindful introspection, but it is very effective to regard whatevercomes up in our mind during that process as an immediate and most suitableobject to look into. Our direct experience is our mind in action, which displaysthe whole range of our habitual patterns right there on the spot, so there is plentyof material to work on. We do not have to look very far beyond ourselves, norfor lofty philosophical concepts or at other people, to find proper objects forMadhyamaka analysis. It is meant personally, and if we allow it to be, it gets aspersonal as anything could get.When we read Madhyamaka texts, we might think, “I have nothing to dowith all these ancient Indian non-Buddhist schools that are the opponents ofCentrists. Why should I bother with what these people said and how they wererefuted?” Of course, the point is not just to replay ancient debates as if they werefamous historical chess games, without being personally concerned with theircontent. Moreover, it would be an endless enterprise to precisely identify all theopponents in the Madhyamaka texts and their exact views. However, in terms ofapplying what is said in the Madhyamaka texts, it is of secondary importance whoexactly said what—and often this is impossible to ascertain anyway. Rather, it ishelpful to take a closer look at the principles reflected in the various positionsunder debate. When it comes to the fundamental questions of life, humanthought in its principal workings is not so different over time and across culturesas we might think. Who knows, at some point some people might bother towrite “modern” Madhyamaka texts that address the whole range of Western phi-losophy, religion, and science, though this would certainly be a monumentaltask. In the meantime, if we just compare the “ancient” Eastern views with West-ern ideas, we will find a lot of concepts that are used in Western philosophy,metaphysics, and science too. The old Indian schools will not, of course, useexactly the same words, but if we understand what their terms refer to, we willrecognize many of the same things in Western thought, whether the debaterevolves around a primal cosmic substance, a creator god, a final cause of theuniverse, a permanent personal soul, or issues such as universals versus particu-lars. And even if we do not find our own specific ideas—or anything of modernWestern philosophy or science—in Centrist texts, we still can apply Madhyamakatechniques to look into such ideas, once we have understood the principles ofThe Middle from Beginning to End 169Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 169"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"these techniques. After all, they are just tools that can be applied to any view orconcept. For example, we could approach what these texts present by asking our-selves whether we entertain similar views. Do they provide some guidelines forlooking into our own belief systems? Can they stimulate our reflection and under-standing? Madhyamaka texts cannot address every detail of any possible view inthe past, present, and future and thus provide everything in a predigested man-ner. Rather, the debates and refutations in these texts are just exemplary modelsthat are to be applied to our individual mental frameworks and views. The paroleis “do-it-yourself.”The primary prerequisite for this to work—and it is in fact a significantrequirement—is to develop the courage and honesty to really let the Madhya-maka approach illustrated in these texts into our world and our private ideas.Some genuine inquisitiveness and willingness to question our own reference sys-tems is necessary here. This is quite different from keeping our private defensestrategies intact while we just go through the motions of some impersonal tech-nical reasonings or merely repeat what we read and hear from others about empti-ness. Our ego and our various clingings could not be happier with this latterapproach, since it will leave them completely untouched and might even reinforcethem. Then, ego rejoices in security and waves smilingly from the far side of anyeffort we might make. In such a case, our “practice” and our experience or wayof life are two different roads that do not meet.As with any truly transformative process, when taken to heart, this approachcan be—and often has to be—quite disillusioning from the standpoint of cling-ing to our ego and our world. The word “disillusion” usually has quite negativeassociations. It indicates that we have lost something dear to us, which is, ofcourse, true for our cherished clingings. Actually, however, it refers to somethingvery positive: We see through our illusions and let go of hanging on to them, andthus we realize what is actually there and worthy of being cherished. These dif-ferent ways of looking at dis-illusionment are reflected in people’s various reac-tions to the Madhyamaka approach. Depending on what it does to their minds,they may be angry and frustrated or utterly thrilled. Following their usual light-hearted way of putting things, Centrists might well epitomize the path by saying,“Buddhism is one disappointment after another, but, fortunately, enlightenmentis the last.”As was said earlier, Buddhism in general can be understood as a system ofincreasingly subtle concepts that counteract relatively coarser concepts. This isespecially true of the Madhyamaka teachings. The coarser concepts of reality andtrue existence are remedied by the more subtle concepts that things are like illu-sions and dreams and do not really exist. However, these remedial concepts alsomust be remedied by putting them through all four positions of the typical four-cornered analysis and finally letting go of all of them. So the way Madhyamaka170The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 170"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"works can be compared to a kind of homeopathic remedy: The disease—mis-taken conceptualization—is remedied by this same disease in a more refinedform; that is, essentially mistaken conceptions perform the provisonal functionof canceling the coarser symptoms of the disease of confused conceptuality. Justas homeopathy allows the body to regain its natural healthy condition throughits own balancing power, Madhyamaka assists our mind in finding its way backto its natural, primordial ease by seeing its own fundamental being. And like ahomeopathic medicine, the remedy of Madhyamaka dissolves itself in the heal-ing process that it triggers, since it finally has no ground within the resultinghealthy state of realizing ultimate reality.Some may approach reading Madhyamaka as they would a guidebook, andthen follow the path it describes. However, it is a very odd guidebook, in that itonly tells us where notto go. We are instructed to take neither the path of exis-tence, nor the path of nonexistence, nor the path of both, nor the path of neither.Still, the very process of not entering these paths is walking on a path. In morepositive terms, this is called the five paths or the ten grounds of bodhisattvas.However, it is up to us to figure out exactly how and where to step. There isn’treally any broad highway that stretches out straight ahead of us for miles onwhich we can just blindly stumble along. This path has more of a sudden, instan-taneously emerging quality. There is just a tiny new section appearing eachmoment, and no trodden path or even any traces when we try to look back at theway we came. As though out of nowhere, each inch of this path reveals itself justin the very immediate and intimate moments when we realize why it is pointlessto follow one of the other paths that our guidebook identified as wrong. Whenwe clearly see where not to go to the left, the right, uphill, downhill, and so on,we naturally make our mental steps into just the space in between—or around—all these nonoptions. Yet, even one second before our next step, we actually hadnot the slightest idea where to go or even whether there was a path at all. Thus,we are led up to the point where we have left behind each of the paths that couldhave led us astray. At this moment, we realize that we no longer have to watchout for dead ends and misleading routes. Now we just take our nose out of theguidebook for a moment, relax, and look around, and without any warning wehappen on this incredible view. We might have completely forgotten about anykind of view while we were busy following this nowhere path.

However, in terms of the practical appli-cation of the Madhyamaka teachings, it seems more appropriate to treat analyt-ical reasoning in the context of the path. For, as was explained earlier in detail,it is not just some abstract logic or theoretical material; it is explicitly meant tobe put into practice by being applied to all aspects of our existence. Three Stages of Analysis by N›g›rjuna and firyadevaTo give us a slightly broader context for where Centrist reasoning fits in on thepath, it is helpful to first take a look at the three phases of N›g›rjuna’s and firya -deva’s presentation of the Buddhist teachings. N›g›rjuna spoke of the three turn-ings of the wheel of dharma as “the wheel that teaches identity,” “the wheel thatteaches identitylessness,” and “the wheel that puts an end to all bases for views.”In his Four Hundred Verses on the Yogic Practice of Bodhisattvas, firyadeva says:First, one puts an end to what is not meritorious.In the middle, one puts an end to identity.Later, one puts an end to all views.Those who understand this are skilled.439These three wheels of dharma as well as the texts of N›g›rjuna and his fol-lowers are often further described in terms of the three stages of no analysis, slightanalysis, and thorough analysis. Here, the ground (the aggregates, constituents,and sources), the path (the aspects of conduct and means), and the result (enlight-ened bodies, enlightened activity, and so on) are described in accordance with theconventions of the worldly seeming, that is, according to what is consensus fromthe perspective without examination and analysis. Most of what is described inthe stage of no analysis exists as worldly seeming reality in such a way that it isalready worldly consensus or that it is suitable to serve as such consensus. How-ever, there are also some parts in the presentations of ground, path, and fruitionthat are adapted to the yogic seeming, such as the ways of appearance duringmeditative equipoise and subsequent attainment.Those passages in the texts that negate the object of negation—the two iden-tities—and then present nonarising, emptiness, and ultimate reality are explained172The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 172"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"from the perspective of slight analysis, that is, for a consciousness based on cor-rect reasoning.Examples of the final stage, that of thorough analysis, can be found in most ofthe explicit statements of the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras. These say that nothing isestablished as anything whatsoever—be it as existent or nonexistent, permanentor impermanent, empty or nonempty, and so on—and that nothing is suitableto be apprehended as anything whatsoever. In his Fundamental Verses, N›g›rjunaagrees:Do not pronounce “empty”Nor say “nonempty.”Do not say both nor neither.It is [only] for the sake of imputation that they should be pronounced.440Such passages are explained by relating them to the final stage of thorough orexcellent analysis. Here, “analysis” does not mean conceptual analysis but refersto directly seeing the true nature of phenomena as it is. Candrakırti’s Entranceinto the Knowledge of Centrismsays: In this natural state of primordial nonarising,There is nothing to be negated and nothing to be affirmed.Nirv› ̊a and nonnirv› ̊aAre without difference in the natural state of nonarising.This is not even nonarising as such,Because arising things do not exist.The seeming does not exist, the ultimate does not exist,Buddhas do not exist, sentient beings do not exist,Views do not exist, something to be meditated on does not exist,Conduct does not exist, and results do not exist:The actuality of this is what is to be cultivated.Let this mind free from thoughts rest in its own peace.Without identifying something, without being distracted,Without characteristics and luminous—thus meditate.441Presented in this way, the Centrist teachings are not at all contradictory to any-thing the Buddha taught.The necessity to connect one’s dharma practice to the three phases of the Bud-dha’s teaching and the three stages of analysis is argued for as follows.

Thus, the provisional path to favorable rebirth in thehigher realms within cyclic existence is accomplished, which serves as the appro-priate support for further practice. The second phase of putting an end to iden-tity is necessary because when one brings slight analysis into experience, allmistaken views about personal and phenomenal identities are eliminated. Thisaccomplishes the path to liberation from cyclic existence. The third phase of put-ting an end to all views is necessary, because when one brings excellent analysisinto experience, all reference points of any kind of view will finally dissolve. Thus,the path to omniscience is accomplished.Is Reasoning Reasonable?In general, whenever reasoning is used in Buddhism, it is always understood asa means to an end—liberation from suffering—and not as an end in itself. Interms of its practical application, two situations are distinguished. We mayemploy reasoning as a tool to eliminate our own confusion or to help others dis-pel their mistaken views. In both cases, our motivation to engage in the processof reasoning and our attitude toward ourselves and others are what determinewhether this process just makes us more uptight or serves as a transforming prac-tice that helps us relax our mental grasping. Thus, in Buddhism the motivationto use reasoning should be compassion, which is the heartfelt wish to eliminatesuffering for both ourselves and others. When we go through Centrist reasoningsfor our own sake and do not just analyze outer things or the positions of othersin a book but allow the Centrist approach to enter our private territory, it will getvery personal. Here, we basically debate with ourselves; in other words, our prajñ›communicates with our ignorance and clinging. In this process, having compas-sion for ourselves means having a very gentle approach when we investigate ourbelief systems, neuroses, and emotions. We will encounter various degrees ofinner resistance depending on the solidity of our clinging to certain fixed ideasor to what seems to make up our personality. If this becomes too overwhelming,we are well advised to take a break, relax, and remember that all of this—includ-ing our resistance—is not as real and heavy as it seems. We may also consider thatCentrist reasonings can be compared to some temporarily painful surgery thateventually leads to greater well-being. In addition, to look at our resistance tooand examine it through Centrist reasoning is an integral and important part ofthe whole process.When Centrist reasoning is used in communicating with others, from the per-spective of more advanced practitioners who have already gained incontrovertible174The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 174"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"certainty through these reasonings, debate can only be an expression of theircompassion. In other words, for them, discussions with others are only accept-able when they are founded on the motivation to help other people remove theirsuffering. On the other hand, for people who have not yet gained incontrovert-ible certainty, their motivation to engage in debate should be twofold: Of course,the basic wish to help others is indispensable, but clearly also the openness toquestion one’s own views and understandings is necessary. It is explicitly saidthat one should not even start a debate with any other motivation. Thus, rea-soning and debate in Centrism are not performed to fulfill a mission, to show offour skill at argumentation, to win a contest and put others down, or to confirmthat we are right. When debate is embedded in a genuine mutual wish to sharpenone’s understanding in an unbiased way, it is not a contest in which one personwins and the other loses. Rather, in contrast to just reviewing certain topics byoneself, debate is understood as a joint venture of discovering more about thetruth by uniting the individual analytic capacities of the two debaters in the inves-tigation of a topic that is of interest to both parties. Consequently, the two par-ties do not work against each other or fight; they cooperate so that both win inthe sense that they mutually enhance their insights. In other words, two eyes ofprajñ› see better than one.Needless to say, in order to engage in meaningful debates using Centrist rea-sonings, one must have gained at least some degree of understanding of thesereasonings. There is no point in just reading Madhyamaka books withoutattempting to practice and understand the reasonings they contain. Otherwise,there is a danger of consequently presenting a wrong view of dharma to others,such as trying to bless the world with one’s own version of “the highest Buddhistview that everything is empty.” Even if we have the proper motivation and arewell versed in the arguments and techniques of debate, we are discouraged fromdebating with people who are only eager to dispute and not ready to change theirminds no matter which arguments they meet (of course, this applies to ourselvestoo). Also, we definitely should not pour our wisdom—or our lack of it—oversomeone who does not even want to hear about Buddhism or Centrism. Mis-sionary ambitions are clearly foreign to the Buddhist approach. Furthermore, inboth these cases, our efforts would be fruitless and a waste of time. More impor-tant, we could create great resistance in other people to the Buddha’s teachings,the very means for liberation from suffering. Therefore, it is surely detrimentalto use these teachings in a way that makes someone else suffer, such as by forc-ing them upon a person who shows no interest in them.Finally, it seems worthwhile to point to the seemingly paradoxical and elusivenature of Centrist reasoning. If properly used, it not only deconstructs what is tobe refuted, but at the same time it naturally brings about its own disintegrationonce its target has been invalidated. Thus, having dissolved both the problem andThe Middle from Beginning to End 175Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 175"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"the remedy, the mind is left at ease, with no dualistic flux stirring in the peace-ful, luminous expanse of the unity of wisdom and emptiness. One might won-der, Why not just leave the mind at peace and not disturb it with all thisconceptual diffusion? To give a very simplified example, it is a bit like jogging.After we have done our laps and taken a shower, when we sit down at home, wefeel relaxed, supple, and at peace. We could, of course, have saved the effort ofjogging and just stayed home and relaxed on our couch anyway. However, thosewho jog know that this is definitely not the same. When we go through theprocess of making an effort in training the body, our ensuing relaxation has acompletely different quality. In the same way, the process of having our mind doits rounds of prajñ› training makes a huge difference in the mind’s ability to restin its own true nature. Merely letting it rest naturally is possible too, but this isfar from easy. Moreover, just resting the mind is not enough. There also has tobe a quality of looking at our mind with fresh sharpness and wakefulness. AsMilarepa says:Don’t be attached to the pool of calm abiding,But let the foliage of superior insight burst into open bloom.This same principle also applies to practicing the various levels of the creationstage (Vajray›na deity visualization) that generally belong to the category of calmabiding. They are followed by the completion stage, which adds the factor ofsuperior insight. Moreover, such concentrated mental activities as analytical med-itation on emptiness or deity visualization may very well provide the chance of a“gap experience” dawning right in their middle. As Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayesings in his Song on Having Gained a Mere Fraction of Certainty in the View andMeditation of the Incomparable Tagbo Kagyü, Called The Self-Dawning of the Fun-damental State:In the midst of thought I found nonthought.Within the freedom from ordinary mental states, wisdom dawned.442As for the benefits of using analytical reasoning in dharma practice, KhenpoTsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche says that a great amount of merit can be gatheredby doing the standard Tibetan preliminary practices for Mah›mudr›443or otherVajray›na practices. However, only very skillful and well-trained practitionerscan accumulate an equal amount of wisdom in this process. On the other hand,through the practice of the progressive stages of meditation on emptiness, largeamounts of both merit and wisdom will accrue. This accords with the fact thatthe practice of the perfection of prajñ› includes all forms of meritorious actions.In fact, it was a tradition in India to train in these meditations on emptiness as176The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 176"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"the preliminary practices for Mah›mudr› and Vajray›na. Consequently, KhenpoTsultrim Gyamtso often advises practitioners to follow the approach of usingsuch analytical meditations.Reasons and NegationsThe Three Modes of a Correct ReasonThe standard form of a reasoning consists of three parts: the subject, the predi-cate, and the reason. For example, in the sentence “Sound is an impermanentphenomenon, because it is produced by causes and conditions,” the subject is“sound,” the predicate is “an impermanent phenomenon,” and the reason is“being produced by causes and conditions.” Whether such a reasoning is valid ornot mainly depends on the reason. In Buddhist logic, the three criteria to deter-mine a valid reason are called the three modes. The reason in a formal probativeargument444is a valid means to establish what is to be proven only if the subject,the predicate, and the reason are in correct relationship to each other. The defi-nitions of the three modes are as follows:1) The subject propertyis a reason that has been determined to be present in allinstances of the flawless subject in question in a corresponding formulation.2) The positive entailment is a reason that has been determined to be present onlyin the homologous set.3) The negative entailmentis a reason that has been determined not to be pres-ent in a single instance of the heterologous set.To explain this in a simple way,445let’s call the subject A, the predicate B, and thereason C. The three modes correspond then to the following diagrams:subject propertyorpositive entailmentornegative entailmentorThe Middle from Beginning to End 177Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 177"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"What is the purpose of these three modes? In terms of set theory, if the reason Cincludes all of the subject A, and the predicate B includes all of the reason C, thenautomatically the predicate B includes all of the subject A, which is exactly thethesis (A is B) that one wants to prove: If C ⊆A and B ⊆C ⇒B ⊆A.orAs should be obvious from the diagrams, the subject, the predicate, and thereason refer to sets of phenomena, not just names or abstract features. For exam-ple, “sound” means the set of all possible sounds, and “produced by causes andconditions” stands for all phenomena that are so produced. To give an example,we may say, “Sound is an impermanent phenomenon, because it is produced bycauses and conditions.” Here, the reason “produced by causes and conditions”must include the subject “sound,” and the predicate “impermanent phenome-non” must include the reason. In other words, the set of sounds is included in theset of what is produced by causes and conditions, and this latter set is includedin—here coextensive with—the set of impermanent phenomena. As a result, theset of sounds is automatically included in the set of impermanent phenomena,which is what is to be proven.As can be seen from the diagrams, the subject and the reason on the one sideand the predicate and the reason on the other side do not necessarily have to bemutually inclusive or coextensive. It is sufficient if the subject is a subset of thereason and the reason is a subset of the predicate, for example, as in “The soundof a flute played by a musician is an impermanent phenomenon, because it is pro-duced by effort.” Here, whatever is a sound of a flute played by a musician is nec-essarily something that is produced by effort, but whatever is produced by effortis not necessarily the sound of a flute played by a musician. Likewise, whateveris produced by effort is necessarily impermanent, but whatever is impermanentis not necessarily produced by effort, such as a tree or a river.In Buddhist reasoning in general, these three modes can be formulated in twoways. One is called “inference for oneself” and the other “inference for others.”446The first one serves to allow one to understand by oneself what is to be proven,while the second is employed to assist others in understanding what oneself hasalready understood. An example of a three-membered inference for oneself is:(1) My own five aggregates as the subject are (2) impermanent, (3)because they are produced by causes and conditions.178The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 178"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The same formulated as an inference for others reads:(1) Whatever is produced by causes and conditions is (2) impermanent;(3) for example, the five aggregates of someone who is dying.(4) My own five aggregates too are (5) produced by causes and conditions.Obviously, the meaning and what is to be proven are the same in both formats.The latter format just adds an example (3) and explicitly states the first mode (4and 5) and the second mode (1 and 2).447Types of ReasonsRegarding the characteristics of the reasons themselves, in Buddhist logic onedistinguishes three basic types of reasons:1) nature reasons2) result reasons3) reasons of nonobservation1) The first is a reason that has the same conventional or relative nature as thepredicate. To be sure, here, “nature” does not refer to the ultimate nature of phe-nomena, emptiness, or the like. It is rather a matter of two sets of things beingof the same conventional type or the same category. For example, all vegetableshave the nature of being or belonging to the category of plants. Thus, one can say,“Carrots are plants, because they are vegetables.” Or, as in the example above,“impermanent phenomena” and “what is produced by causes and conditions”have the same nature in that whatever is the one is necessarily the other. In otherwords, all impermanent phenomena have the nature of being produced by causesand conditions, and all that is produced by causes and conditions has the natureof being impermanent.2) Result reasons are reasons that are a result of the predicate and thus prove hid-den causal phenomena. For example, when one says, “Behind this hill, there isfire, because there is smoke,” smoke is a result of the existence of fire. Thus, fromthe direct perception of a result (smoke), one can infer the prior existence of itscause (fire).3) The definition of a correct reason of nonobservation is “a reason with the threemodes in the proof of a probandum that is the negation of a phenomenon, or,completeness of the three modes in the negation of that which is to be negated.”In general, reasons of nonobservation prove the nonexistence of somethingThe Middle from Beginning to End 179Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 179"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"through the fact that this something is not perceptible or observable through anykind of valid cognition. There are two types of reasons of nonobservation:a) reasons of the nonobservation of something that does not appear448b) reasons of the nonobservation of something that is suitable to appear449a) The definition of a correct reason of the nonobservation of something that doesnot appear is “a reason with the three modes that negates the conventional expres-sion of ‘definite existence’ by negating the cognizing subject of something that isnot suitable to appear.” An example is the reason “because there is no valid cog-nition that could observe a ghost,” which proves that the conventional expression“the definite existence of a ghost” does not apply to the area in front of someonewho does not have any propensity to perceive ghosts. In brief, this negation servesto clarify that one cannot claim the general existence of private, delusive appear-ances such as ghosts for everyone just because they may appear from the per-spective of certain people. Otherwise, all things such as hallucinations orappearances in the minds of insane people would have the status of general exis-tence for everyone.b) The definition of a correct reason of the nonobservation of something suitableto appear is “a reason with the three modes that proves both the fact and theconventional expression of ‘nonexistence’ by negating the cognizing subject ofsomething suitable to appear.” This is the sole type of reason that is employed inthe Centrist reasonings that analyze the ultimate nature of phenomena or empti-ness. The most straightforward way to put this is to say, for example, “In thisroom, there is no elephant, because none is observable in it through any kind ofvalid cognition.” Usually, if there is an elephant somewhere, given sufficient lightand nothing obscuring it, it is clearly observable to the people present whosesense faculties are intact. Thus, the inverse of this—that is, if an elephant is notobservable in this place—means that it does not exist there.There are many more of these kinds of reasoning that indirectly negate thething in question. In technical terms, these can be summarized into two:i) reasons of the nonobservation of something connected450(to the predicate ofwhat is to be negated)451ii) reasons of the observation of something contradictory452(to the predicate ofwhat is to be negated)i) Something that is connected to the predicate of what is to be negated can be(1) its conventional nature, (2) any of its results, (3) any of its causes, or (4) alarger category to which it belongs. An example of an unobserved cause is the180The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 180"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"proof “On this lake, there is no smoke, because fire cannot be observed there.”Here, the predicate of what is to be negated is “there issmoke.” Thus, the factthat the cause (fire) of the phenomenon in question (smoke) cannot be observedat a certain place serves as the reason to negate the existence of this phenomenon(smoke) itself, since smoke is the result that is invariably connected to this cause(fire). In other words, if a certain cause does not exist, its result cannot existeither.ii) Something that is contradictory to the predicate of what is to be negated maybe (1) its nature, (2) its result, or (3) a subset of it. An example of the first is theproof “Right at the location of this blazing fire, there is no coldness, because ablazing fire is observed there.” Here, the predicate of that which is to be negatedis “there iscoldness.” The opposite of this is that “there is heat, such as a blazingfire.” First, the existence of heat somewhere is established through the observa-tion of a blazing fire there. Second, observing a blazing fire and its heat is con-tradictory to and excludes observing coldness in this very same location. Thus,what is notobserved there is coldness, which directly negates the existence ofcoldness. In this way, the observation of fire indirectly serves as the reason to dis-prove the existence of coldness. Of course, the examples given here consist ofmundane trivialities, but when these reasons of nonobservation are applied tosuch objects of negation as real existence, an intrinsic nature, or the two types ofidentity, they get right to the heart of the matter of Centrist analysis.In general, the first two basic types of reasons—nature reasons and result rea-sons—are called affirming reasons, since they either affirm a common conven-tional nature of different things or the conventional existence of something. Thethird type—reasons of nonobservation—is called a negating reason, since it doesnot affirm anything but merely negates the existence of something.PseudoreasonsPseudoreasons are reasons in which one or more of the three modes are not estab-lished. There are three main types of such mistaken reasons:1) nonapplying reasons (reasons that do not apply to the subject as a means ofproof)2) contradictory reasons (reasons that negate their own probandum)3) uncertain reasons (reasons that create doubt about their own probandum)1) Nonapplying reasons are of five types:a) nonapplication for the proponentb) nonapplication for the opponentThe Middle from Beginning to End 181Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 181"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"c) nonapplication for both (“Sound is permanent, because it is an object of theeye consciousness.”)453d) nonapplication due to its basis being unestablished, that is, the subject in ques-tion being nonexistent (“The present king of France has difficulty wearing hiscrown, because he is bald.”)e) nonapplication because the connection of the subject to the reason is doubt-ful (“On the middle one of three mountain ridges in front of me, there is a pea-cock, because I hear the sound of peacock cries.”)2) Contradictory reasons are of four types:a) contradictory reasons that negate the nature of the predicate (“Sound is per-manent, because it is produced.”)b) contradictory reasons that negate the nature of the subject (“Space can hurt,because it is obstructive.”)c) contradictory reasons that negate an attribute of the predicated) contradictory reasons that negate an attribute of the subject3) Uncertain reasons are of three types:a) uncertain reasons in which the negative entailment is most obviously doubt-ful (“This man has attachment, because he speaks.”)b) uncertain reasons in which the positive entailment is most obviously doubtful(“This woman is free from attachment, because she does not speak.”)c) uncertain reasons in which both are doubtful (“Living bodies have a self,because they possess a life force.”)Specific Applications of These Reasons in BuddhismThe particular topics to which nature reasons, result reasons, and reasons ofnonobservation are mainly applied on the Buddhist path are respectively the fol-lowing:1) impermanence2) cause and result3) the two identitylessnesses and emptiness1) Nature reasons are mainly employed to prove the impermanence of all condi-tioned phenomena. To be a conditioned phenomenon means first to be pro-duced by certain causes and conditions. Then, the phenomenon’s continuum issustained by further causes and conditions. Finally, when these specific causes andconditions end at some point, the conditioned phenomenon that was supported182The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 182"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"by them must necessarily cease too. Thus, it has the nature of being impermanent,since the definition of being impermanent is to arise, abide, and cease. Reflect-ing on this coarse aspect of impermanence serves as the primary means to reverseour attachment to the things of this life. Reflecting on the notion of subtle imper-manence—the impermanence of all conditioned phenomena changing in everymoment—leads us to understand emptiness. It is said that whoever understandsarising and ceasing will understand impermanence, and whoever realizes imper-manence will realize the unity of dependent origination and emptiness. Withrespect to dependent origination, N›g›rjuna’sSixty Stanzas on Reasoning says:Through understanding arising, one understands ceasing.Through understanding ceasing, one understands impermanence.When one understands how to penetrate impermanence,Also this genuine dharma will be realized.4542) Result reasons are used to establish the functioning of cause and result in gen-eral. This refers not only to outer or material causes but, more important, to theinner level of causality, which is the operation of karmic causes and results. Karmameans that all our physical, verbal, and mental actions or impulses are causesthat have effects in the same way any other causes do. In Buddhism, this princi-ple of causality is also employed to establish the continuity of former and laterlifetimes. In any case, result reasons infer prior material or mental causes from theobservation of certain material or mental conditioned phenomena in the presentthat are the results of these causes. Basically, Buddhism says that the functioningof cause and effect means both that something cannot come from nothing andthat something cannot become nothing. Otherwise, anything could randomlyhappen at any time or nothing would ever happen. Moreover, without cause andeffect, all intentional actions, such as farming to produce the result of a harvest,would be completely unpredictable or pointless.Therefore, in Buddhism, it is not really a question of just believing or notbelieving in the law of karma or former and later lifetimes. Rather, if we gener-ally accept the process of cause and effect, we must acknowledge that it does notmake sense to arbitrarily exclude some causal phenomena—that is, certain or allof our physical, verbal, and mental actions—from this general principle. Thisholds true even if we do not see an immediate result of these actions and hope tohave avoided their consequences. In fact, we generally do experience the effectsof our impulses, emotions, and thoughts, since our physical and verbal actions areconstantly driven by them. When we plan a project or do our work, we do notthink at all that our mental activities have no results; we take it for granted thatour thoughts and imagination will result in visible actions and products. Also, weknow very well the strong and possibly devastating effects of certain mentalThe Middle from Beginning to End 183Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 183"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"impulses, such as falling in love or declaring war. That it might take a long timefor the effect of some action to ripen cannot be a basis for claiming that thisaction has no effect. Otherwise, it would equally follow that the movements ofthe original continents on earth are not the causes for the location and shape ofthe present continents, since the beings at that time did not experience the effectat present, nor do we at present observe these causes.It would be highly inconsistent to say that some things or experiences havecauses while others do not. This would also imply that there are some causes thathave results and others that have no results. How could we reasonably defineand distinguish between such phenomena? (In addition, for those phenomenathat do not have causes, all the above absurd consequences would apply.) When-ever someone discovers the cause of something that was previously considered arandom event—as has happened and continues to happen in science—the entirenotion of causelessness or randomness is fundamentally questioned. Moreover,how could uncaused phenomena interact with phenomena that do have causes?If they interacted in a purely random way, even phenomena within an estab-lished causal continuum would become random phenomena. And if they inter-acted in a way that is determined by causes, random phenomena would enter therealm of causality. If there were, however, two entirely separate realms of phe-nomena, they could not interact at all.As for the classical proof for the existence of past and future lives, we must firstrealize that if we accept the principle of causality as functioning in an all-encom-passing way, then there have to be infinite chains of specific causes and results.For example, a tree that we see now has a beginningless “case history” of causesand conditions, each of which again entails its own causes and conditions. Like-wise, according to Buddhism, the present moment of our mind does not comeout of nowhere but arises from the immediately preceding moment of this mind.In other words, mind does not depend on anything other than mind as its spe-cific substantial cause.455By extending this backward and ahead in time, we nat-urally arrive at a mental continuum without beginning or end, which manifestsas what is called the different lifetimes of cyclic existence. To arbitrarily postu-late any starting point or a total extinction of this continuum—such as the begin-ning or the end of this life—amounts to nothing more than saying thatsomething can come from nothing or something can become nothing. Yet thisopenly contradicts the notion of cause and result as such in the first place.Further indications that are adduced for the existence of other lifetimes includefacts such as newborn mammals immediately knowing without learning whereand how to drink milk from their mothers.456Furthermore, what would accountfor the immense range of differences just among human beings even at birth,such as being born healthy or with a severe disease, being intelligent or dumb,being born rich or in a slum, in a loving family or a violent one?

Even conventionally, none of these facts can be suf-ficiently explained by causes that can be found in this present life, but this usu-ally just leads to subsuming them under rubrics such as “fortune,” “fate,” or“talent.” The most fashionable category these days seems to be that “it’s all in thegenes.” This is not the place to discuss this issue in detail, but if we just considerhow little the genetic code of human beings differs from that of chimpanzeesand some primitive worms—by just 1 percent and about 30 percent respec-tively—it is quite amazing to assume that the genes alone can serve as an expla-nation for all the differences between humans and other beings. To be sure, thesedifferences do not consist of only physical features, but include the entire rangeof the human mind and its expressions, such as culture, science, philosophy, andreligion, not to mention all the mental and behavioral diversity of human beingsthemselves, who have even less genetic variance from one another.3) Reasons of nonobservation specifically serve to negate all kinds of imaginarythings and mental reference points—such as real outer objects or a self—that areimagined to exist by ordinary worldly persons as well as people who are influ-enced by certain philosophical systems. Hence, particularly in Centrism, thesereasons are not just used to prove the nonexistence of an otherwise existing thingin a certain spot, as in the example of an elephant given earlier. Rather, they areprimarily employed to demonstrate the nonexistence of all such hypotheticalthings that never existed as knowable objects in the first place and thus can nei-ther be directly perceived nor inferred through any means of valid cognition.The general thrust here is that if something that is merely assumed to exist—suchas purple rabbits or a real personal self—cannot be observed through any kind ofvalid cognition, then the only conclusion can be that there is no such thing alto-gether and that it is just a figment of the imagination.It is important to distinguish between our concept of, for example, a pink rab-bit with wheels and an actual phenomenon that would correspond to this idea.For the mental image of such a pink rabbit has some degree of conventional exis-tence in that it can appear as an object of our thinking mind. Apart from thismere fantasy, though, an actual such animal does not exist and will never appearto us. As was said before, we can think about anything and create all kinds ofimaginary things in our conceptual consciousness. However, the mere fact thatwe can think of or imagine something that does not actually exist does not makeit any more real or existent. Thus, what are “refuted” in Centrism are not actu-ally existing, real things or an actual real self. Rather, since we construct all kindsThe Middle from Beginning to End 185Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 185"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"of imaginary notions about such nonexistents (real things and a self), Centristreasoning only serves to deconstruct our mistaken ideas. For example, the exis-tence of a lasting, independent, and singular personal self within an individ-ual’s five aggregates is refuted by observing among them only what iscontradictory to such a self. This means that the five aggregates consist only ofphenomena that are momentarily impermanent, dependent on various causesand conditions, and do not have an identifiable single core, since all of them canbe taken apart infinitely. Thus, all that we can observe among them is depend-ent, not lasting, and not single. This then excludes the existence of anything inthese aggregates that is lasting, independent, and singular, such as this hypo-thetical self.Within the specific approach of Centrist reasonings, the two kinds of affirm-ing reasons are used to some extent, but solely with respect to seeming reality andby just employing the conventional notions of others, such as in the context ofcause and result. When investigating for ultimate reality—that is, when dealingwith emptiness or the two types of identitylessness—Centrists solely employnegating reasons of nonobservation. As was explained at length, in emptiness,there is nothing to be affirmed in terms of either nature or existence nor in termsof nonexistence. Thus, when reasoning is applied in the Centrist search for theultimate, its only purpose is to eliminate wrong ideas and clinging to real exis-tence. Therefore, affirming reasons—as they are used in accordance with con-ventional dialectics—are impossible and useless here.NegationsObviously, the conceptual result of negating reasons is a negation. The generaldefinition of a negation is “a phenomenon to be cognized by the cognition thatdirectly cognizes it through excluding its specific object of negation.” In Indo-Tibetan logic, there are two kinds of negations:1) implicative negations and2) nonimplicative negations.The definition of an implicative negation is “the implication of another phe-nomenon as a remainder after the negation of the object of negation by a cogni-tion that directly cognizes the negation itself.” Thus, an implicativenegation—which may also be called predicative negation—implies or affirmssomething else as a remainder after having negated certain features with regardto the subject in question. An example would be to say, “Heaven is not imper-manent,” which implies that it is permanent.457The classic example is the state-ment “Fat Devadatta does not eat during the day.” Being fat shows that he doeseat, and what is implied as a remainder of the negation of eating during the day186The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 186"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"is another phenomenon: that he eats during the night.The definition of a nonimplicative negation is “something that is to be cog-nized by a cognition that directly cognizes it through merely excluding its spe-cific object of negation.” This may also be called “negation of existence,” since itmeans that the existence of something is negated without affirming or implyinganything about it instead. Thus, the cognition that directly cognizes a nonim-plicative negation cognizes that part of the sentence that represents the mereexclusion—or the mere negation—of its specific object of negation. It does not,however, cognize or imply any other phenomenon, be it directly or indirectly.Examples of this kind of negation are “the nonexistence of heaven,” “space,”458“emptiness,” and “identitylessness.” In terms of formulating a nonimplicativenegation, it does not matter whether there is a grammatical negative in the for-mulation that represents the mere exclusion of the specific object of negation (asin “the nonexistence of heaven” or “identitylessness”) or whether there is no neg-ative in the actual term (as in “space” or “emptiness”). The point is that, in oneway or another, the formulation must indicate the absence of something and notimply anything else in its place.All Centrist reasonings arrive at nonimplicative negations. There is nothingthat is conceptually implied in their analysis of ultimate reality. Therefore,implicative negations are not used in Centrist reasoning for the ultimate. In fact,their use would be counterproductive to the Centrist approach altogether, sincethey would just supply new reference points by implying something.In terms of the path, ultimate reality or emptiness has to be realized in twostages: first conceptually and finally within nondual and nonconceptual medita-tive equipoise. Thus, first one cultivates the particular conceptual consciousnessthat is based on Centrist reasoning and results from inferential reflection. Thisis called an “inferential valid cognition.” It is the first type of valid cognition toascertain ultimate reality, and thus it precedes the second and final type of suchvalid cognition, which is the direct, nonconceptual realization of emptiness fromthe path of seeing onward.The cultivation of an inferential valid cognition of emptiness involves againtwo steps. First, in order to counteract our habitual strong clinging to the realexistence of all phenomena, we have to initially cultivate a number of inferentialvalid cognitions for which various nonimplicative negations clearly appear, suchas the nonimplicative negation that “there is no arising, no abiding, and no ceas-ing” or that “an intrinsic nature of phenomena does not exist.” Even on the con-ceptual level, it is very difficult to immediately gain a correct realization of theactual emptiness that is free from the four extremes and the eight referencepoints,459which means nothing other than the complete lack of reference points.To conceptually arrive at this kind of emptiness is the second stage and at thesame time the final result of analytical reasoning.The Middle from Beginning to End 187Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 187"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The negations in both steps are called “nominal ultimate reality,” since theymore or less accord with actual ultimate reality on the conceptual level. The mostsubtle conceptual object “freedom from all reference points” is the mental imagethat appears to an increasingly refined reasoning consciousness and concordswith ultimate reality to the highest degree that is possible for conceptual objects.It is the result of prolonged familiarization with the major Centrist reasoningsthat are all tailored to tackle our clinging to reference points from various angles.Still, no matter how subtle a concept this final step of nominal ultimate realitymay be, whether it is “freedom from all reference points” or “no reference pointwhatsoever, not even the freedom from reference points,” it cannot in itself gobeyond being a subtle conceptual object.Thus, to approach the direct realization of actual emptiness in a gradual man-ner, one first familiarizes oneself with a number of nonimplicative negations thatprogressively negate each extreme and all reference points. Generally speaking,this is the cultivation of inferential valid cognition as the initial direct remedy forthe clinging to real existence. It is a series of conceptual cognitions that progressfrom eliminating more coarse superimpositions to negating very subtle ones.Finally, the nonimplicative negation of “nothing whatsoever” or “emptiness”—that is, no reference point at all—appears. Here, we have to distinguish clearlybetween the plain fact of there being no reference point whatsoever and how thisfact appears to our conceptual reasoning consciousness. When we reflect on theabsence of any reference points, the very appearance of the concept that “thereare no reference points whatsoever” is not just nothing at all, but it is an objectthat appears and thus exists for a conceptual consciousness. As such, it is clearlystill a reference point in itself.Second, once there is familiarity with this conceptual remedy, one needs to gobeyond it, which means that this subtle reference point of “no reference pointwhatsoever” has to be abandoned too at some point. As N›g›rjuna’sSixty Stan-zas on Reasoningsays:Those whose minds are not moved,Not even by a flicker of a thought about “complete voidness,”Have crossed the horrifying ocean of existenceThat is agitated by the snakes of the afflictions.460In other words, negations that merely negate an actual arising, real existence, andsuch are conceptual and nominal ultimates. These negations are not free from themore subtle reference points of “nonarising,” “the lack of real existence,” or “thefreedom from reference points.” The actual direct experience of there being noreference points—including the reference point of there being no referencepoints—is the actual or nonnominal ultimate.188The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 188"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"If one approaches ultimate reality through this twofold process, it is said thatit becomes very accessible even for ordinary beings. In this way, it is definitelypossible to develop not only the correct conceptual view of nominal ultimatereality but also the immediate experience and direct realization of genuine empti-ness or nonnominal ultimate reality. ⁄›ntideva describes this process in threecrucial verses:Through familiarity with the latent tendencies of emptiness,The latent tendencies of entities will be relinquished.Through familiarity with utter nonexistence,These too will be relinquished later on.Once this “utter nonexistence”—The entity to be determined—cannot be observed,How should a nonentity without a basisRemain before the mind?Once neither entities nor nonentitiesRemain before the mind,There is no other mental flux [either].Therefore, it is utter nonreferential peace.461The commentary of the early Sakya master Sönam Tsemo462(1142–1182) explains:Proving that the realization of everything as an illusion is the path hasthree parts:1) Relinquishing clinging to existence2) Relinquishing clinging to nonexistence3) The justification for thisThe first refers to “Through familiarity . . .” [lines 32ab above].

Howshould nonentities, [such as the negation of entities,] remain before themind as objects of reasoning? . . . They are without basis, because,through the superimposition that is the negation [of something], thebasis [for this negation]—the superimposition of an object of nega-tion—does not exist [anymore].

Without a[specific] object of negation being identified, negation would be per-formed in a [completely] indiscriminate way.

Then, the object generalities of existenceand nonexistence do not appear and there is [also] no clinging to whatis outside. Therefore, this is utter nonreferential peace. It is the arisingof supreme knowledge that is without appearance in that there is nofocus for superimpositions and the continuum of thoughts hasstopped. “However, there may be other superimpositions that repre-sent some mental flux [different from] the object generalities of exis-tence and nonexistence. Therefore, it is not necessarily established that[this knowledge] is without any appearances at all.” There is no othermental flux, because there is no [possibility] other than existence andnonexistence.464Thus, it is explained that, after exhausting the power of terms, conceptions, andobjects of negation as well as their remedies, the ensuing mental peace is similarto having finally recovered from some serious hardship or struggle.Centrist treatises set up the positions of others and then analyze them by usinga great number of reasonings. However, none of this happens out of hatred ofother systems or a mere enjoyment of dispute. Rather, it is done solely from theperspective of others and their benefit, that is, in order to put an end to theirintense clinging, bound as they are through the web of their conceptions. As TheEntrance into Centrismsays:190The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 190"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The analyses in [N›g›rjuna’s] treatise were not performed out ofattachment to debate.[Rather,] true reality has been taught for the sake of complete release.It may well be that while explaining true realityThe scriptures of others become ruined, but there is no fault in this.465Therefore, the whole spectrum of reasoned analysis that is employed in Centristtreatises is nothing but an approach that aims at putting an end to the otherparty’s conceptions that are engaged in superimposition and denial. However,once superimposition and denial have been eliminated, the bare and direct real-ization of the actual nature of phenomena does not arise through the force ofthorough analysis, because this true nature is not an object that can be analyzedor grasped through study, reflection, or conceptual meditation. Thus, TheEntrance into Centrismsays:Ordinary beings are bound by conceptions.Nonconceptual yogins will find release.Hence, the learned state that the result of analysisIs that conceptions are at peace.466Here, three things about every nonimplicative negation, no matter how sub-tle or all-encompassing, should be very clear. First, a negation is by definitionexclusively an object of a conceptual consciousness, that is, an inferential validcognition. It can never be an object of a direct and nonconceptual valid cogni-tion, since the process of negating and its object are of a conceptual nature. Sec-ond, since it appears as a conceptual object, in terms of the categories of existentsand nonexistents, this negation itself is still considered an existent phenomenonfor the conceptual mind. It is the subtle form or way in which “nonexistence” or“the freedom from reference points and extremes” appears to the reasoning con-sciousness. Therefore, this conceptual object “nonexistence” is not in itself non-existent, nor is it in itself the actual freedom from all reference points andextremes. Third, one must eventually let go of both this conceptually appearingobject—the negation—and the dualistic cognition for which such an objectappears, in order for it to give way to the nonconceptual wisdom that directlyrealizes the actual emptiness free from all reference points.As Pawo Rinpoche states, a negation is nothing but an imputation by a mindthat clings to nonexistence, and an affirmation is just an imputation by a mindthat clings to existence. In light of the true nature of phenomena, all clinging—no matter to what—is simply mistaken. Nonimplicative negation is just a tech-nical term whose meaning refers to nothing other than what is normallyunderstood by “nonexistence.” Thus, in this context of Centrist reasoning, theThe Middle from Beginning to End 191Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 191"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"meaning of the nonimplicative negation “being nothing whatsoever” refers tothe complete nonexistence of reference points. A sÒtra states:Those who understand this dharma of “being nothing whatsoever”Will be without attachment toward all phenomena.In this way, it is clear that such a nonimplicative negation is just a step towardthe direct realization of actual ultimate reality. Otherwise, if ultimate reality itselfwere nothing but a nonimplicative negation, then it would just be some con-ceptual kind of nonexistence in the sense of nothing whatsoever. On the otherhand, if ultimate reality were an implicative negation or something affirmative,then it would be something actually existent. Obviously, none of these categoriesapplies to the actual or nonnominal ultimate, and there is no third possibility.The Eighth Karmapa denies both the position that ultimate reality is a nonim-plicative negation (or even one that is supposed to withstand analysis) and theposition that ultimate reality is completely inexpressible. It seems that the firstscholar to explicitly identify the ultimate as a nonimplicative negation was ChabaChökyi Senge.467Later, Tsongkhapa and his followers also adopted this positionand held that actual emptiness is a nonimplicative negation that withstands analy-sis. However, if it were possible to arrive at something that withstands analysis,such as the nonimplicative negation “the lack of real existence,” this would turnthe whole project of Centrism—the demonstration that there is nothing thatwithstands analysis—upside down. As was explained above, this point is expressedmany times in numerous Centrist texts as well as in the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras:I declare that all phenomena including nirv› ̊a—and even if therewere any phenomenon more supreme than that—are illusionlike anddreamlike.468The point that there is nothing that can withstand analysis is also the majorreason for the detailed presentation of the twenty emptinesses, for each of themserves to eliminate specific and increasingly subtle aspects of holding on to some-thing real. Moreover, since such a nonimplicative negation is supposed to with-stand analysis while at the same time being exclusively a conceptual object, therewould be no way to ever abandon it in order to directly realize genuine ultimatereality (as described by ⁄›ntideva above). There would not even be a need toabandon this nonimplicative negation and proceed to a direct realization of ulti-mate reality, since such a negation already isthe actual ultimate reality. An exemplary proponent of the view that ultimate reality is absolutely inex-pressible was Tsang Nagba Dsöndrü Senge.469From this position, it wouldabsurdly follow that—just from the perspective of how Centrists appear to oth-192The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 192"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"ers—those Centrists who, through their skill in means, teach or say anythingabout true reality would not be Centrists. This would mean that Centrists whonegate real existence would not be Centrists. Also, if ultimate reality could not beexpressed at all, it would be utterly pointless that the Buddha taught the Prajñ› -p›ramit› sÒtrasand that so many Centrists have composed voluminous texts. In brief, nonnominal ultimate emptiness—the actual object of the wisdom inthe meditative equipoise of noble ones—is beyond either withstanding or notwithstanding analysis. In itself, it is inexpressible. On the other hand, the nom-inal emptiness in the form of a nonimplicative negation that is the object of theworldly valid cognition of a reasoning consciousness470definitely cannot with-stand analysis. This is also clearly indicated by ⁄›ntideva’s third verse above. Nev-ertheless, there is no problem in Centrists’ skillfully using such names as “ultimatereality” or “emptiness” for that which is essentially without name. Thus, sincethey employ such illustrative designations to point to the ultimately inexpressibletrue reality, it cannot be said that they are unable to conventionally express it. TheEighth Karmapa emphasizes that this is a very subtle and essential point in theCentrist approach.What Is the Object of Negation in Centrist Reasonings?What is refuted through Centrist reasonings? Technically speaking, it is thenotion of some real and intrinsic existence or nature of phenomena. This refersto the concept that phenomena exist in an independent way, in and by them-selves. If something does not depend on any other factors extrinsic to it—causes,conditions, time, or circumstances—for its existence but stays the same no mat-ter what happens, then it is real in the sense of being unchanging and inde-pendent. If some phenomenon really were independently existent in its ownright, such independent existence should become even more obvious when it isanalyzed. However, in fact, the opposite is the case. The more we look for aninherently existing thing, the less we find it. This unfindable real or independ-ent existence is the direct object of negation that is refuted throughout Centristtexts, whether it applies to the true existence of a personal self or the inherent exis-tence of any other phenomenon. On the other hand, whatever is under the influ-ence of something else and thus originates in interdependence with variousconditions is not ultimately real in the above sense but is just something thatappears and functions on the level of seeming reality. Thus, from the perspectiveof their mere appearance and dynamic fluctuation, the entire display of seemingly“outer” objects, “inner” minds that perceive them, and so on is not the target ofCentrist refutations. Mere illusionlike appearances as such are not the Centristobjects of negation. As Jñ›nagarbha’s Distinction between the Two Realitiessays:The Middle from Beginning to End 193Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 193"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"What has the character of appearanceIs definitely not negated.It is not appropriate to negateThat which is experienced.Such aspects as “arising”Are not what appears.We negate what is imputed by others,Such as that [these imputations] are knowable objects in actuality.Therefore, here it is appropriateTo negate solely such imputations.Negating what is not an imputationIs only to harm oneself.471First, it makes no sense to negate what are merely temporary appearances,since there is no way that we could just reason them away. For example, as longas the eyes of someone with blurred vision are not freed from their defects, mis-taken visual objects such as floating hairs or double moons will continue to appearfor this person. Likewise, the illusionlike appearances of the six consciousnesseswill not subside as long as the cognitive obscurations and their latent tendenciesthat trigger such appearances have not been relinquished, no matter how manyreasonings are flung at these appearances.Nor is there any need to negate mere appearances, because our afflictions andsufferings do not originate from them; they originate from our clinging to themas being real. Just as an illusionist does not cling to the appearance of a handsomeyoung man that was created by her own power, we will not be bound in cyclicexistence if we are not attached to its appearances despite their seemingly real exis-tence. On the other hand, just as a naïve audience develops desire for this illu-sory young man, we cling to the reality of fleeting appearances, and our afflictionsincrease. If it would work to deliberately negate these mere appearances, thenemptiness would be nothing but utter blank nonexistence. Also, if training inmeditation on emptiness just meant cultivating a total negation in the sense thatnothing exists at all, it would be equivalent to falling into the extreme of extinc-tion or nihilism.Thus, it is said that mere appearances as such are not what is refuted in Cen-trism. However, that it is not possible to negate them has to be taken with a grainof salt. Initially, through Centrist reasonings in the context of studying and reflect-ing, the coarser portion of our clinging that takes these illusionlike mere appear-ances to be real things is eliminated. This stops the manifest clinging to their realexistence. Later, through combining the power of the knowledge gained from194The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 194"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"studying and reflection with the meditative equipoise that is the unity of calmabiding and superior insight, the undefiled knowledge or “reasoning” that springsfrom meditation arises. Once even the latent tendencies for real appearances havebeen eradicated in this way, also the subtle portion of the clinging to reality—which manifests as the appearance of illusionlike mere appearances—becomespure like space without any reference points. For example, for someone who suf-fers from blurred vision and mistakenly clings to the appearance of some black dotsagainst the background of a white cup, a skilled physician first clarifies that thesedots do not exist by saying, “They only appear because of your disease.” By under-standing that these dots do not exist, the sick person puts an end to her miscon-ception of there really being such dots in this cup. Nevertheless, since the causefor the plain appearance of these dots has not yet been removed, they still appear.Hence, in order to stop their appearance, the physician has this person take apotent medicine that eliminates blurred vision altogether. Once the disease hasbeen removed, the “dots” are just like space without any reference points.Therefore, as long as seeming appearances have not been put to an end, it isreasonable to make efforts to eliminate them, such as being heedful with regardto cause and result while meditating on the emptiness of all phenomena. On theother hand, within the meditative equipoise of yogic practitioners who see thatall phenomena are free from reference points, there is nothing to be eliminated.However, without these considerations, to say that it is neither possible nor nec-essary to negate mere appearances through reasoning may become rather absurd.For, if one is not able to negate mere appearances, they would then be ultimatereality, because they are something that withstands analysis and cannot be inval-idated through reasoning. It would furthermore follow that worldly people can-not realize true reality, because it is impossible to negate the really existingphenomena of seeming reality. For, if they cannot be negated through reasoning,they also cannot be negated or stopped through the path of meditation. And ifthey cannot be negated or stopped through either reasoning or the path, there isno other means to put an end to them.Thus, Centrist reasonings address the basic tendency of mistaking appearancesas really existing phenomena and a really existing self, including all the ramifica-tions and implications of such misconceptions. However, when Centrists speakabout “real existence,” this does not mean that “real existence” is some factor orelement that is extrinsic to the phenomena that appear to us. For example, thatvisible form lacks real existence does not mean that visible form is empty of somereal existence that is something other than this visible form itself. As The Entranceinto Centrismsays:Since it is its nature,[Visible] form is empty of [visible] form.The Middle from Beginning to End 195Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 195"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Sound, smell, taste, tangible objects,And also phenomena are just like that.472Candrakırti’s autocommentary explicitly explains this point:Here, one speaks about emptiness [as the fact] that the eyes and so on[are empty] of these very eyes and so on. This makes it completelyclear that [this is] the emptiness of a nature, whereas it is not an empti-ness of one not existing in an other, [such as] “the eye is empty, sinceit lacks an inner agent” or “it is empty of the nature of apprehender andapprehended.”473In brief, to say that form lacks or is empty of real existence means exactly the sameas to say that it lacks a nature or characteristics of its own, that form is empty ofform, or, that form is not different from its emptiness. As The Prajñ›p›ramit›SÒtra in Hundred Thousand Linessays:SubhÒti asked: “How should bodhisattvas train to understand that allphenomena are empty of their own specific characteristics?”The Blessed One said: “Form should be seen as empty of form, feel-ing empty of feeling, and so on.”SubhÒti asked: “If everything is empty of itself, how does the bod-hisattvas’ engagement in the perfection of knowledge take place?”The Blessed One answered: “Such engagement in the perfection ofknowledge is non-engagement.”474The Heart SÒtrastates:Form is emptiness; emptiness is also form. Emptiness is no other thanform, and form is no other than emptiness.So what exactly is this notion of real existence? On the objective side, it isnothing but a vague idea or mental image. When we think or say “I” or “chair,”these are just terms, but at the same time we seem to sense a more or less vaguesomething that floats around in our conceptual mind and to which these termssupposedly correspond.475Depending on how much we are influenced by certainviews or philosophical systems, these vague conceptual objects may be elaboratedinto a more or less sophisticated conceptual construct, such as an eternal soul or196The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 196"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"a real cosmic substance with all its features. However, what is the stuff that thesemental images themselves are made of ? As long as we do not look too closely atour notions, such as “I” and “chair,” they seem to exist and function in a way thatfeels very natural and real. We might just say, “Of course, I know who I am andwhat a chair is, and now I will sit down on one.” However, as soon as we try topinpoint—or even analyze—these notions, they become extremely elusive. Infact, the more we look at the ideas that seem to drift through our mind and tryto identify them, the less we can find them. This is not because we are not search-ing properly but simply due to them being the imaginary phantoms that they are.So we might wonder what good it will do us to refute such phantom ideas. Infact, these figments of our imagination are not the actual problem to be remedied.They are just the objects of negation as they are identified and set up in the for-mulations of Centrist reasonings. The actual problem that causes us suffering—and the real target of Centrist reasoning—is the subjective side of theseimaginations: the fact that we take them to be real, cling to them, and behave asif we and the world around us existed in a way that exactly corresponds to theirappearance. Therefore, the way in which Centrist reasonings touch upon ourexperience is that they indirectly undermine our subjective clinging to the fixedideas of a real self and real phenomena by directly demonstrating that there isnothing to which these really refer and nothing that corresponds to them. There-fore, it is crucial to see that Centrist reasoning does not mean just shooting atsome dead concepts while leaving our direct, living experience of ourselves andothers completely untouched. When they are investigated, it becomes clear thatour mistaken notions are rootless and baseless. Thus, none of them has everexisted as an object in the first place. However, as long as we take them forgranted as real objects, our subjective holding on to them will lead to all the well-known consequences. The only way to let go of them from the side of the expe-riencer is to realize that there is nothing on the object side that would justify ourgrasping, just like realizing that a tree in the dark is not a monster.When we analyze the term “object of negation” in Centrist reasoning, it isobvious that the two types of identity or “real existence” do not exist as actualobjects to be negated. They are mere imputations or fictions, since the existenceof a permanent, singular, and independent personal identity within the range ofall phenomena is impossible. Any other entity that is really established throughan intrinsic nature of its own is equally impossible. Since there is thus no actualobject of negation on the objective side, there never was or will be anything tobe relinquished there. Hence, on the objective side, the object of negation of rea-soning is just something that is conceptually imagined by a mistaken cognition,while it does not exist as an object of any unmistaken cognition. For example,from the perspective of a conceptual consciousness that misapprehends a twistedtree in the dark as a monster, a mere imagination of a monster appears. ThisThe Middle from Beginning to End 197Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 197"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"imagined conceptual object does not itself exist as a monster, nor does it refer toan actual monster out there. However, without our thoughts erroneously settingup this wrong conceptual object of a monster, subjectively, the ensuing mentalstates of clinging to the existence of this imagined monster and becoming afraidof it would never arise. This is something that is established for everyone in theworld by direct experience.The same relation between conceptual objects and subjects applies to reason-ing. On the conventional level, one may set up the proof that “sound is imper-manent, because it is produced by causes and conditions.” Here, the opposite ofwhat is to be affirmed or proven—”sound is impermanent”—is the object ofnegation of reasoning, that is, “sound is permanent.” This wrong concept “soundis permanent” exists as a phenomenon that is imputed by the corresponding mis-taken conceptual consciousness that takes it as its object. However, this conceptdoes not exist as an object of any unmistaken cognition. Therefore, N›g›rjunasaid that, on the level of no analysis, all elements of the triad of the object ofnegation, the means of negation, and the act of negating are presented in mutualdependence. When analyzed, however, there is utter freedom from these threemental reference points. Thus, in the Centrist system, all objects of both nega-tion and affirmation are merely imputedly existent and not substantially exis-tent,476nor are they existent in any other real way. If the object of negation ofreasoning were not something that is merely imputed, this would contradict thefact that it cannot be found when searched for. On the subjective side, when it is said that the actual object of negation of thetwo identitylessnesses is the clinging to these identities, this does not literallymean that this mistaken cognition itself can be negated or annihilated. Rather,when the term “object of negation” is used with regard to the subjective side ofour wrong notions, it is just a technical term that indicates that it is nothing butour habitual grasping to reference points that we have to let go. Of course, fromthe Centrist point of view, this grasping itself is not something real either. How-ever, in a dualistic mind, as long as there is the mistaken notion of a certainobject, there will also be the notion of its subject. Only by realizing that theobject is illusory can the subject that holds on to it dissolve naturally. On theother hand, if there were any object of negation that is not just an imputation butis established as a really existing entity, we would not be able to negate or relin-quish it, no matter how we tried. For it is impossible to negate or eliminate some-thing that actually exists or, for that matter, prove the existence of something thatdoes not exist in the slightest.Thus, for Buddhist reasoning and meditation to be soteriologically efficient,we must understand that their actual target is not found on the objective level inthe form of a real personal or phenomenal identity. Rather, the actual impact ofstudy, reflection, and meditation always lies on the subjective level. This means198The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 198"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"that we first uncover and then undermine all the largely unconscious and instinc-tive forms of grasping at the two identities in order to let go of them and enableour mind to rest relaxed in its own natural ease.In more technical terms, in the context of the knowledge gained through studyand reflection, the actual object of negation of reasoning is the instinctive mistakenmode of cognition that, based on our fundamental unawareness, imagines thetwo kinds of identity (personal and phenomenal) and takes them to be really exis-tent. This very tendency to reify where there is nothing to be reified is also whatwe have to release in our meditation practice. Thus, it is also the object of nega-tion of the path of yogic valid perception that arises from meditation. In this way,our innate clinging to personal and phenomenal identities is the actual object ofnegation through both reasoning and the path. The Entrance into Centrismsays:First, we cling to our self, saying “me,”Then we develop attachment to things, saying “this is mine.”Through mentally seeing that afflictions and mistakes without exceptionOriginate from the views about a real personalityAnd realizing that the self is the object of these [views],Yogic practitioners negate a self.477Thus, Centrist reasonings primarily work on the experiencing and clingingmind. Consequently, the way to evaluate their effectiveness is to look at what hap-pens to this mind in terms of becoming more flexible and relaxed both during thereasoning process up through gaining incontrovertible certainty and while famil-iarizing oneself with this certainty in meditation.The Status of Valid Cognition in CentrismIn general, the Buddhist teachings on valid cognition as systematized by Dign›gaand Dharmakırti assert two types of valid cognition: perceptual valid cognitionand inferential valid cognition. These are commonly accepted as undeceivingand reliable means of knowledge. To Centrists, though, just like any other phe-nomena, they are not exceptions to being empty of a nature of their own. Con-sequently, all epistemological means and logical techniques are denied the statusof true validity or reality. They only serve as illusory remedies for illusory delu-sions and in fact are not any different in nature from the delusions that they helpto overcome. As AtıŸa’s Entrance into the Two Realitiesclearly says:Perceptual and inferential cognition—These two are accepted by Buddhists.The Middle from Beginning to End 199Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 199"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Only narrow-minded fools sayThat emptiness is realized by these two.andPerceptual and inferential cognition are useless.It is just for the sake of refuting non-Buddhist opponentsThat the learned ones have promoted them.The learned master Bhavya saidThat the scriptures are clear about[The ultimate] being realized neither throughConceptual nor nonconceptual consciousnesses.478In his Rebuttal of Objections, N›g›rjuna invalidates the standard objections tothe Centrist approach and elucidates the nature of its dialectic approach. Hedenies the notion of valid cognition altogether:If your objectsAre well established through valid cognitions,Tell us how you establishThese valid cognitions.If you think they are established through other valid cognitions,There is an infinite regress.Then, the first one is not established,Nor are the middle ones, nor the last.If these [valid cognitions] are established even without valid cognition,What you say is ruined.In that case, there is an inconsistency,And you ought to provide an argument for this distinction.479His autocommentary on these verses first describes the position of others: “Theobjects to be validated are established through valid cognitions. Just like theseobjects to be validated, the validating cognitions themselves are established throughother valid cognitions.” N›g›rjuna argues that such a process of validating thesevalidating cognitions would never be finished, since each one that is supposed tovalidate the preceding one in turn needs another one to validate itself. Thus, onewould never even get close to validating the actual objects to be validated. On theother hand, someone might think, “These valid cognitions are established evenwithout other valid cognitions, since they establish the objects to be validated.”200The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 200"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"This statement, however, contradicts and thus ruins the claim that “valid cogni-tions establish their objects.” For there is the internal inconsistency that certainobjects would be established through valid cognition, while others—the validcognitions themselves—would not. To account for such inconsistency, a furtherargument would have to be provided; that is, there would need to be a reason thatonly some objects are established through valid cognition. Since nobody is ableto come up with such a reason, this latter position is untenable too.480N›g›rjuna further argues that if valid cognition were established as valid cog-nition through itself alone, it would not be dependent on anything else, not evenon its own object to be validated. So, of what would it be a valid cognition? Itbasically would be a consciousness that is not conscious of anything, which bydefinition is impossible. On the other hand, if valid cognition is establishedthrough its object to be validated, how is this object established in the first place?If it is already established before and without valid cognition, what need is therefor any further cognition to validate it? Furthermore, if valid cognition estab-lishes the object to be validated and the object in turn establishes what valid cog-nition is, then neither of them is really established as such. They are just mutuallydependent. One might think that this is just like a child being produced by itsfather and the father being made into a father through his child. In that case,though, what is produced by what? It is not possible that the same thing is boththe cause and the result of something else.Thus, valid cognitions are neither really established through themselves alone,nor through other valid cognitions, nor through their objects to be validated,nor through mutual production, and also not without any cause at all.481Some opponents try to turn the tables on N›g›rjuna:“If a nature of all entitiesDoes not exist in any of them,Your words are also without natureAnd cannot refute a nature.However, if these words have a nature,Your earlier claim is ruined.As there is such inconsistency,You should provide an argument for this distinction.”and“Arguments are not established,Because they are without nature, so where is your argument?Once the absence of a reason is established,Your point cannot be proven.The Middle from Beginning to End 201Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 201"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"If, however, the rejection of a nature were establishedEven without your having an argument [for this],Then it is also established that there is a natureEven though we do not have an argument [for it].However, if arguments exist, it is unjustifiedThat entities are without nature.Nowhere is there any entity to be foundThat is without nature.”482N›g›rjuna’s ultimate answer is as follows:My words are without nature.Therefore, my thesis is not ruined.Since there is no inconsistency,I do not have to state an argument for a distinction.483N›g›rjuna readily agrees that his words—just like all other things—are alsoempty, without a nature of their own. Therefore, his own “thesis” that “all enti-ties are without nature” is not ruined, since it is also empty and there are no non-empty—that is, really existing—words to establish it.484He never said that hiswords are not empty while all other things are empty. So there is no differencebetween theses or words and any other things in that they all lack any intrinsicnature. Therefore, N›g›rjuna does not have to distinguish between empty thingson the one hand and “real” words to prove a “true” thesis on the other. However,this categorical answer seems to render Centrism itself completely obsolete, sinceit eliminates any possible ground for engaging in the process of reasoning alto-gether. If everything is empty—including the means to come to this conclu-sion—any use of arguments seems to be utterly pointless, since there is nothingto be affirmed or negated and nothing that could affirm or negate anything.So is this the final word in Centrism? Ultimately speaking, yes, but in termsof the path, Centrists indeed bother to employ natureless reasonings to takecare of our natureless ignorance that otherwise would result in natureless suf-fering for natureless sentient beings. The only reason they do so is to help us real-ize that things have no nature. Usually, logic and reasoning are employed toestablish and defend certain positions or reference points to which a certainreality is ascribed. However, Centrist reasonings are not refutations in the senseof rejecting an opponent’s view and promoting one’s own view instead. TheCentrists’ whole point is to dissolve our already existent reference points and theclinging to them. They definitely do not try to provide new views or referencepoints to which to cling. This is precisely what they are very careful to avoid.202The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 202"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Thus, their use of logic and reasoning is a critique of reasoning through rea-soning itself. To be consequent in eliminating all views without exception, this same prin-ciple must be applied equally to all types of mistakenness and clinging that areentertained by both oneself and others. However, it is not only a matter of beingconsequent. More important, the main purpose in dissolving all systems and ref-erence points, including one’s own, is to bring about liberation from clinging toreally existing things, which is what ties beings down in cyclic existence. For howcould the deconstruction of all views be helpful in any other way than to eradi-cate and prevent this same basic mistake of reification that we all constantly makeand that causes us to suffer?If both what is refuted and what refutes are without a nature, this naturallybegs the question of how such empty reasonings could be effective in any way.N›g›rjuna answers:Just as one magical creation may be annihilated by an[other] magicalcreationAnd one illusory person by another personProduced by an illusionist,This negation is the same.485The audience watching a magic show or a movie may experience one illusorybeing killing another. However, both the being that appears to be the killer andthe one that is killed are empty; they are not really existent. Likewise, in the con-text of seeming reality, it is justified that the empty and illusory words ofN›g›rjuna’s negations can negate or cancel out an illusory assumed nature of allthings, thus arriving at the conclusion that all things are empty. Therefore, Cen-trists employ reasoning and such as expedient tools in their discourses only inas-much as these tools have a certain effectiveness as illusory remedies against illusoryfixed ideas. In other words, an illusionlike thesis may be deconstructed by anillusionlike refutation, since the latter has some conventional remedial powerwithin the framework of seeming reality that appears due to fundamental igno-rance. ⁄›ntideva sets up the question and then addresses this issue:“If valid cognition is not valid cognition,Isn’t what is validated by it delusive?In actuality, the emptiness of entitiesIs therefore unjustified.”Without referring to an imputed entity,One cannot apprehend the lack of this entity.The Middle from Beginning to End 203Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 203"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Therefore, the lack of a delusive entityIs clearly delusive [too].Thus, when one’s son dies in a dream,The conception “He does not exist”Removes the thought that he does exist,But it is also delusive.486Here an opponent objects that if there is no valid cognition, there can also beno object that is validated or found by it. Since all Centrist reasonings are sup-posed to point to emptiness, emptiness—as the outcome of such invalid reason-ings—equally cannot be established as valid. Ultimately, ⁄›ntideva and allCentrists simply agree with this, since there is nothing to be found, established,or negated and also nothing to be validated or invalidated. It is precisely thisactuality that is called emptiness. As for the term “emptiness” itself, it is part ofthe means that assist in the realization of this actuality on the seeming level. Onereason is that the negation of something has to depend on a preceding notion ofthe existence of this given something. For example, one cannot speak or thinkabout the nonexistence of a table without having the notion of a table in the firstplace. Another reason is that communication and conceptual understanding haveto rely on conventional notions or terms—which are always imputations—inorder to be capable of pointing out what they refer to. For example, if one doesnot rely on the conventional term or notion of “space,” one is not able to under-stand what it refers to, that is, the absence of things. Thus, without employingthe mere imputation of “emptiness” (nominal emptiness), one is not able toapprehend what it points to (nonnominal emptiness): the actual experience thatall imputations (including the one of emptiness) do not exist.Here, ⁄›ntideva’s point is that existence and nonexistence can negate eachother even if they are both dreamlike. For example, in a dream in which one’schild has been born and then dies, there is definitely no difference between thechild’s birth and its death inasmuch as both are unreal dream appearances. Still,because of the experience in the dream that the child is born, the thought “Mychild exists” arises. When it then appears to die, the dreamer thinks, “My childhas died and does not exist anymore.” In the context of such a dream, this latterthought has the capacity to remove the earlier notion that “my child exists.”However, since both the existence and the nonexistence of this child are equal inbeing dream appearances, they are alike in being delusive. Likewise, the lack ofa nature applies to both what negates and what is negated.In order to counteract the clinging to existence, the approach of negating exis-tence with nonexistence is useful despite the temporary danger of clinging toemptiness as being mere nonexistence. Sentient beings wander in cyclic existence204The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 204"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"because they cling to the reality of delusive things that are mere appearances.Therefore, the understanding that these very appearances are unreal and illu-sionlike may surely serve as a provisional remedy for their clinging to real things.However, the imputation of the nonexistence of such delusive appearances—”emptiness”—is clearly delusive too. Hence, applying the notion of emptiness isnothing more than engaging in a particular (more subtle) reification, that is,apprehending emptiness, as the remedy for another (coarser) reification: con-ceiving of things as real. Still, the overall result of this process is an increase in wis-dom. Thus, in his Entrance into Centrism, Candrakırti also illustrates it througha positive example:Though [the reflection of one’s face in a mirror] is not real, it is there forthe purpose of beautifying this face.Likewise, also here, our arguments are seenTo have the capacity of cleansing the face of knowledge.It is to be understood that what is to be proven is realized even through[arguments] that lack justification.487The Eighth Karmapa comments that the reflection of one’s face that appearsin a mirror is not real in the sense of actually being one’s face. Still, on the levelof no analysis, this reflection appears and may serve as a support for beautifyingone’s face, by shaving or putting on makeup. The same applies in the context ofnegating the assertions of the world through reasons that are acknowledged byothers. It becomes evident to other disputants that Centrist arguments have thecapacity of cleansing the stains of ignorance from the face of knowledge. Thismeans that, from the perspective of these people, Centrist invalidations, such as“being empty by nature,” possess the power to invalidate what is to be invalidatedand to prove what is to be proven. One should understand that what is to beproven is realized even through arguments that are just acknowledged by others,while lacking any justification through the three modes of a reason that are estab-lished by their nature.In hisRebuttal of Objections, N›g›rjuna presents a counterargument and thenrefutes it:“If what lacks a natureCould stop what lacks a nature,Then what lacks a nature would ceaseAnd a nature become established.”If [you say that only] existents can be negated,Is emptiness then not well established?The Middle from Beginning to End 205Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 205"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"For you negate the nonexistenceOf a nature of entities.As for the emptiness that you negate,If this emptiness is nonexistent,Does that not ruin your statementThat [only] “existents can be negated?”488His autocommentary says that, in Centrism, what is negated through wordsthat lack a nature is a nature of entities. If it were the lack of a nature of entitiesthatis negated through words that lack a nature, then entities would indeed becomesomething that has a nature, because what lacks a nature has been negated. Sincethey thus became something that has a nature, they would not be empty. How-ever, this is not what N›g›rjuna says: He states that entities areempty—that is,they lack a nature—and does not claim that they are nonempty.489Furthermore, what the above counterargument by some opponents implies isthat one can only negate something that exists and not something that does notexist—that lacks a nature. However, at the same time, these very people try tonegate emptiness, stating that a nature of all entities does not exist. In otherwords, they say that emptiness does not exist. However, if emptiness—theirobject of negation—does not exist, then their statement that one can only negatewhat exists and not what does not exist is wrong. Or, if this statement is correct,since they negate a nonexistent—emptiness—this nonexistent emptiness mustthen be something existent, because negating a nonexistent results in an existent.And if emptiness exists, this amounts to establishing that a nature of all entitiesdoes not exist. At first glance quite impenetrable, these verses just show the strin-gency with which N›g›rjuna evaporates all possibilities of grasping at a referencepoint. On top of that, he demonstrates that any attempt at finding a flaw inemptiness is inevitably flung back onto one’s own grasping for something reallyexistent, just like a boomerang.Finally, N›g›rjuna says that, actually, there is neither something to be negatednor any words or persons to negate it, since all things are equally unreal andempty. Thus, in Centrist reasoning, there is never any negation happening. It isonly from the perspective of others who cling to the real existence of things thatit seems as if these things were negated. Consequently, Centrist reasonings do notannihilate previously existing things; they just elucidate that these things did notreally exist in the first place.I do not negate anythingAnd there is also nothing to be negated.Therefore, it is you who slander meBy saying, “You negate.”206The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 206"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"To say that the words of a negationWork even without existing wordsMakes one understand that words do not exist,But it does not serve to eradicate them.490The words “all entities lack a nature” are not the cause that makes things lacka nature. Rather, they serve as a means to help those who do not know that enti-ties lack a nature realize this fact. For example, this is comparable to when some-one says, “Devadatta is at home,” while Devadatta is in fact not at home. Otherswho know better might then correct this person by saying, “No, Devadatta is notat home.” Obviously, these words do not cause Devadatta to be not at home; allthey do is to point to his absence.491Since words, concepts, logic, and reasoning are mere imaginary imputationsand do not represent any real world apart from such imputations either, ulti-mately what is there to be refuted and what to be implied? Words and reasoningsneither really exist in themselves nor relate to anything real as their referentobjects. Thus, Centrists do not feel obliged to believe in the real existence of thereasonings and methods that they use, nor in their intrinsic power and validity.In terms of the view, Centrists use seeming reality in general and reasoning,words, and concepts in particular in a way that is completely noncommittal.492Consequently, in his Lucid Words, Candrakırti says that, unlike some peoplewith sticks and lassos, words do not overpower their speaker. Also, the refutationof something through a nonimplicative negation does not imply its opposite (oranything else, for that matter). So if nothing is implied in a nonimplicative nega-tion and others still insist that it must imply the opposite of what was negated,it is like when a shopkeeper says that there is nothing to be sold and a customerrequests, “Then please sell me this nothing.” Thus, to negate that things arisefrom themselves does not imply that they arise from something other, both, orneither, for they simply do not really arise at all. Negations as they are used byCentrists have to be understood in the practical context of removing errors andwrong ideas. They function as “disillusionment” in the most literal sense. Thus,Centrist negations are negations of judgment altogether and not just anotherjudgment. It is as when we say, “I clean up the dirt on the floor.” By this state-ment, we mean nothing but the removal of dirt from the floor. It does not implythat we afterward find a thing called “dirtlessness” on the floor instead.What is our starting point to evaluate phenomena when using Centrist rea-sonings in order to realize emptiness? Are phenomena declared to be emptinessbecause they do not measure up to an ultimate and given true reality? Or do wejust examine phenomena from their own side to realize that they are inconsistent,fluctuating, and without a true core, which may open our eyes to discoveringtheir emptiness? From the Centrist point of view, the only way to truly go beyondThe Middle from Beginning to End 207Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 207"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"delusive appearances is to start by taking a closer look at the very appearances ofeveryday seeming reality that are right in front of our noses, and not to try to com-pare them with some more or less speculative ultimate reality. Such a comparisonmust necessarily fail, because any “ultimate reality” that we could conjure upwithin the limits of our essentially dualistic mental framework could only be justanother reference point within this very framework. In other words, there is noway that we could transcend the net of duality by adding another sophisticatedknot to it. This is the main reason Centrists are so adamant about not giving usanything to hold on to in terms of ultimate reality. As they keep saying, ultimatereality can only be realized through seeing that seeming phenomena are not whatwe take them to be. Thus, when we employ Centrist reasoning on the path, wehave to proceed from how things seem to be to how they actually are and not theother way around, that is, by trying to look at things from the perspective of someimputed ultimate reality. In other words, the Centrist approach starts with whatis right in front of our eyes and not with some ultimate castle in the sky.As mentioned earlier, this approach necessarily implies that at the end of theprocess of analysis and deconstruction, our wrong ideas and their remedies mustboth dissolve naturally, without our having to apply further remedies for theremedies. From the perspective of the ultimate true nature of phenomena, prob-lems and antidotes are both expressions of the fundamental ignorance thatobscures this nature. Only when both afflictive and remedial ignorance have sub-sided is there the possibility of an unobstructed view of what is pointed tothrough Centrist analysis. ⁄›ntideva explains this by excluding an infinite regressof analysis:If what has been analyzedIs analyzed through further analysis,There is no end to it,Because that analysis would be analyzed too.Once what had to be analyzed has been analyzed,The analysis has no basis left.Since there is no basis, it does not continue.This is expressed as nirv› ̊a.493If one Centrist analysis had to be analyzed by another analysis, it would fol-low that there is no end to analysis, because the analysis of the first analysis wouldhave to be analyzed again by a third one and so on. However, this is not how Cen-trist reasoning works. Rather, prajñ› is the means that analyzes the mistakenideas that have to be analyzed, and it does so in such a way that gradually theyare all addressed. Once these wrong ideas have been thoroughly analyzed by208The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 208"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"prajñ› and are incontrovertibly seen to be mistaken, they dissolve. As soon asthey disappear, the purpose of the analysis is fulfilled, and thus the analysis itselfwill also subside on its own. Therefore, it is nothing more than a specific analy-sis for a specific purpose. Apart from that, neither mistaken ideas nor their analy-sis have any special basis or nature. Since there is no purpose left for such analysis,once its specific task has been accomplished, it does not continue after the mis-taken idea in question has been put to an end. The analysis stops on its own, justas a fire dies down as soon as the firewood has burned up. Once all clinging interms of superimposition and denial has come to an end in this way, nothing butthe empty and luminous nature of the mind in which there is nothing to beremoved or to be added is laid bare as the fundamental state of all phenomena.This is said to be primordial nirv› ̊a.However, if one were to continue with remedial analysis even at the pointwhen its specific target has already dissolved, then the remedy itself would becomethe problem. For example, once we have overcome an infection through the helpof antibiotics, we do not continue to apply this remedy. Not only would it be use-less, but it would cause further health problems. In his Fundamental Verses,N›g›rjuna explicitly warns against wrong views about emptiness and clinging tothem, be it in terms of existence, nonexistence, permanence, or extinction:By the flaw of having views about emptiness,Those of little understanding are ruined,Just as when incorrectly seizing a snakeOr mistakenly practicing an awareness-mantra.494In his Lucid Words, Candrakırti comments on this:If one thinks, “Everything is empty, which means that everything doesnot exist,” this is a wrong view. . . . On the other hand, one may wishnot to deny all [phenomena]. Then, however, no matter in which wayone may have focused on these entities, how should they becomeemptiness? Hence, to say that “the meaning of emptiness is not themeaning of lacking a nature”495is definitely a rejection of emptiness.Having rejected it in this way, due to the [ensuing] karmic [result] ofbeing deprived of the dharma, one will go to the lower realms.496The most common charge against Centrism and its way of using reasoning wasand is the accusation of outright nihilism. In The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºka,the Buddha himself prophesied that, in the future, those who cling to speakingin terms of existence or nonexistence will deprecate as nihilists those who saythat all phenomena lack arising. However, such a charge completely disregardsThe Middle from Beginning to End 209Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 209"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"the fact that Centrism as a spiritual path is a comprehensive set of methods witha soteriological purpose. It is clearly intended as a means to attain perfect Bud-dhahood for the welfare of all sentient beings through the compassionate moti-vation and practice of a bodhisattva.

Also, they explicitly and repeatedly explain why the chargeof nihilism does not apply to them. This is evident from Candrakırti’s abovecomment and also from further verses from The Commentary on the Mind ofEnlightenment:To express emptiness as the nature [of entities]Is not to say that anything becomes extinguished.Those who know that entities are emptyAnd then rely on karma and its resultsAre more wonderful than wonderful,More amazing than amazing.In this way, through body, speech, and mind,They always promote the welfare of sentient beings.What they advocate is emptiness,But not the contentions of extinction.498In his Fundamental Verses, N›g›rjuna presents other Buddhists’ attacks againsthim for denying the Buddha’s own teachings on causality, karma, and the fourrealities of the noble ones:“If all of this is empty,There is no origination and no cessation.Then it follows that the four realities of the noble onesDo not exist for you.”499210The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 210"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"He answers by turning the tables on them:If you entertain the viewThat entities exist due to their nature,Then you view entitiesAs lacking causes and conditions.Then cause and result,Agents, actions, and their objects,Arising and ceasing,As well as any effect are invalidated.If all of this were nonempty,There would be no origination and no cessation.It would follow that the four realities of the noble onesDo not exist for you.500Thus, it is precisely this notion of real and independently existent things thatexcludes the existence of any causes that could give rise to such things as well asany results that these things could produce. For, by definition, independentlyexistent phenomena cannot be affected by anything, nor can they themselvesaffect anything. Thus, it is rather for those people who grasp at a real nature ofphenomena that the four realities of the noble ones and the interdependent flowof causality are impossible. Candrakırti’sLucid Wordsconcords:Here, it is said, “If you thus present entities as being without nature,this would eliminate all such statements by the Blessed One as ‘Theripening of the actions that one has performed will be experienced byoneself.’ It would also deny actions and their results. Therefore, you arethe chief of nihilists.” We are not nihilists. By refuting both the pro-ponents of existence and of nonexistence, we illuminate the path thatis without these two [extremes] and leads to the city of nirv› ̊a. Wealso do not say that actions, agents, and results and such do not exist.“So what do you say then?” We say that they are without nature. Onemight think, “This is fallacious, since actions and agents are not justi-fied with respect to what is without nature.” This is not the case either,because it is only among [phenomena] that have a nature that actionsare not seen. [In fact,] actions are only seen among what is withoutnature.501As we have seen, also ⁄›ntideva excludes the notion of utter nonexistence:The Middle from Beginning to End 211Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 211"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Once this “utter nonexistence”—The entity to be determined—cannot be observed,How should a nonentity without a basisRemain before the mind?502Moreover, Centrists do not deny conventionalities, seeming reality, or mereappearances, since the only target of their reasonings is the cause for suffering.

The Fundamental Verses says:Without reliance on conventions,The ultimate cannot be taught.Without realization of the ultimate,Nirv› ̊a will not be attained.509N›g›rjuna indeed relied on conventions and seeming reality to a great degreein order to teach people, as is amply proven by many of his other texts in whichhe describes the path of bodhisattvas or gives practical advice to various persons,ranging from ordinary people to kings.510The same goes for ⁄›ntideva: chaptersone to eight of his Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Lifeare a guidebook forthe seeming reality of practitioners of the great vehicle, and his other main text—The Compendium of Training—goes into many practical details of applying theteachings.In his Jewel Lamp of Centrism, Bh›vaviveka quotes firyadeva with the prag-matic advice to avoid nihilism in any case in order to be on the safe side in termsof potential negative karmic results:Even if they doubt that there are lifetimes beyond this one,Wise people avoid evil actions.If there are no [future lifetimes], there is simply nothing,But in case there are, give up nihilism!511Bh›vaviveka continues by saying that the chain of the appearances of seemingreality is illusionlike. None of it exists for nonconceptual wisdom or the knowl-edge that realizes ultimate reality. Trying to validate seeming appearances is likeasking whether space is broad or narrow, big or small, fragrant or stinking, sweetor sour, soft or rough. Or it is like pondering the shape and color of the horns ofa rabbit. As far as true Centrists are concerned, such “things” cannot be experi-enced, cognized, or validated.512Centrists merely point to the fact that all theseseeming appearances lack any real existence. So how could they be called nihilists?This is like calling someone a nihilist who points to an empty room and says,“There is no furniture here.”In his Lucid Words, Candrakırti explains that to see emptiness as nonexistencemeans not to understand Centrism:What you apprehend [as emptiness] is not what we state as the mean-ing of emptiness in this treatise. Since you do not understand themeaning of emptiness, you neither understand emptiness itself nor theThe Middle from Beginning to End 213Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 213"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"purpose of emptiness. Therefore, through not understanding the actualmode of entities’ own nature, you say a lot of unreasonable things thatare not related to our explanations. So what is the purpose of empti-ness? It is explained in the examination of identity [in The Funda-mental Verses]:Liberation [is attained] through the exhaustion of karma andafflictions.Karma and afflictions [come] from conceptions,And these [result] from discursiveness.Discursiveness is halted through emptiness.513Therefore, emptiness is taught in order to completely pacify all dis-cursiveness without exception. So if the purpose of emptiness is thecomplete peace of all discursiveness and you just increase the web ofdiscursiveness by thinking that the meaning of emptiness is nonexis-tence, you do not realize the purpose of emptiness [at all].514N›g›rjuna finishes his Rebuttal of Objectionsby saying:For those for whom emptiness is possible,Everything is possible.For those for whom emptiness is not possible,Nothing is possible.I prostrate to the incomparable BuddhaWho has perfectly declaredThat emptiness, dependent origination,And the middle path are one in meaning.515Equating emptiness, dependent origination, and the middle path refers to theunity of seeming reality and ultimate reality. All seeming phenomena appear asdependent origination through various causes and conditions, while all of themare empty of any real and independent existence. This is nothing other than themiddle path of not falling into the extremes of permanence and extinction.In general, it may be an appropriate and fruitful approach to use epistemology,logic, and reasoning in order to accomplish certain goals in everyday life and thesciences. However, all of this happens only from the perspective of ordinarybeings whose worldviews and experiences are distorted by fundamental igno-rance about the true nature of phenomena. The Centrist approach is to eventu-ally step out of this playground altogether; it is a completely different ball game,214The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 214"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"so to speak. This means that the typical four-cornered logical analysis of Centrismis the deliberate stepping-stone to go beyond the square playground drawn by thelimitations of dualistic mind. In this way, thoroughgoing negations from manyangles lead to the utter collapse of our conceptual efforts to keep our worldtogether. At some point, conceptual grasping becomes literally exhausted andanother dimension of seeing the world may open up. To realize emptiness is notonly the negation of thought or grasping, but it is the experience of prajñ› or non-dual wisdom beholding the universe outside of our dualistic playground.Usually, we like to think of ourselves as critical, modern persons who do notjust believe in things unquestioningly. However, when it comes to “the facts oflife,” experientially, what we really believe in is what we are used to: our sense per-ceptions, our thoughts, and our feelings. This clearly shows in how we behavetoward the world. From this point of view, we actually are very conservative inthat we just rely on our limited, dualistic outlook. The only other source of infor-mation about the world that we tend to take for granted is modern science.Although we have never seen things such as subatomic particles or complicatedbiochemical processes, if scientific experts tell us about them, we think theymust be true. On the other hand, if the Buddha and other enlightened masters—as the experts in mind science—tell us about karma, past and future lives, bud-dha realms or emptiness, we are rather skeptical.Why do we so easily believe in what modern science says but find it so diffi-cult to believe in the much older science of mind? Why do we listen to modernexperts and have a hard time listening to the Buddha or Centrists? We usually justfollow the habitual tendencies of our minds, which are mainly oriented towardthe outside world and hardly ever look inside. Maybe we do not want to grantthat the Buddhist experts in mental science know their job as well as modern sci-entists know theirs. However, we might at least try to muster a bit more open-ness to consider what they say and not dismiss their findings right away as“unrealistic,” “soft evidence,” and the like. This alone would loosen up our rigidview of the world and ourselves tremendously. Let’s call it “training in opennessto the unexpected and unfamiliar.”As for the issues of valid cognition and reasoning, all of them only make senseas long as they are displayed in a framework whose foundation is the notion ofreally existing things that actually perform functions according to certain acceptedprinciples. In particular, logical rules solely apply for those who buy into suchnotions. These rules can be considered as structures or laws to organize and focusour thoughts, but in themselves they say nothing about the relation of thesethoughts to reality. In addition, various philosophers, scientists, and ordinarypeople do not even agree on a single set of rules or principles that determine suchthings as valid cognition or valid reasoning and agree even less on the definitionof reality. More important, however, there is no way to establish the validity ofThe Middle from Beginning to End 215Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 215"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"knowledge through any criteria that are either intrinsic or extrinsic to this veryknowledge itself. As said before, if valid cognition were justified through itself orthrough other valid cognitions, there is an infinite regress. And if it were justi-fied through something other than valid cognition, how is this other thing vali-dated?Thus, we have to distinguish clearly between the investigation of objects(whether in everyday life or in science) on the one hand and the scrutiny of thefundamental principles or presuppositions of how we know and what we knowon the other. From the Centrist point of view, the first is expedient and the lat-ter is the key to liberation. All empirical knowledge in the world works throughthese presuppositions of knowing that derive from ignorance about the actualnature of phenomena. It is in this sense that such knowledge as well as the waysin which it cognizes its objects are only a seeming reality.On the other hand, the critical dialectics of Centrism is not at all a knowledgeabout seeming reality. Rather, it uncovers and invalidates the very presuppositionsof seeming knowledge by getting at their root: our fundamental clinging to ref-erence points. Therefore, the value of the Centrist critique can never lie in its con-sistency as a system of thought or in any kind of secular utility. Rather, it isgeared toward a clear awareness of mind’s nature and a spiritual freedom that pre-cisely consists in dropping all these presuppositions and reference points thatfunction as our bondage in cyclic existence. It is a process of unveiling what is pri-mordially unveiled. Thus, it does not at all deny true reality but serves to free itfrom all the restrictions of our dualistic grasping at reference points.The crux of Centrism is that it is only possible to get to such freedom by ini-tially employing these very reference points in order to go beyond them. At leastto some degree, this approach inevitably involves language and concepts, whichby definition cannot go beyond being merely instruments for expressing seem-ing reality. So the Centrist approach has no choice but to work with language andconcepts in order to point to something that is inexpressible through either ofthem. As Culler puts it:[D]econstruction’s procedure is called “sawing off the branch on whichone is sitting.” . . . One can and may continue to sit on a branch whilesawing it. There is no physical or moral obstacle, if one is willing to riskthe consequences. The question then becomes whether one will succedin sawing it clear through, and where and how one might land. . . . If“sawing off the branch on which one is sitting” seems foolhardy tomen of common sense, it is not so for Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger,and Derrida; for they suspect that if they fall there is no “ground” tohit and that the most clear-sighted act may be a certain reckless saw-216The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 216"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"ing, a calculated dismemberment or deconstruction of the great cathe-dral-like trees in which Man has taken shelter for millennia.516It should be obvious by now that Centrists belong to the small club of those whoare not afraid to hit noground.The final question here is this: How can we ever validate the Centrist path ortrue reality if this path includes a denial of valid cognition? The “ultimate test”lies in our own experience. In order to come to a final clarity about whether allof this is “true” in the sense of functioning as a reliable means leading to the real-ization of ultimate reality and the irreversible liberation from suffering, we haveno choice other than to put it into practice and see whether we actually attainBuddhahood through it. Strictly speaking, to gain an incontrovertible experi-ence of being—and staying—free from all suffering and to manifest omniscientwisdom in our own mind stream is the only way to personally verify that theCentrist approach works all the way to the end. As physicians would say, “Who-ever heals is right.” As is well known, a disease cannot be overcome by just look-ing at the medicine and pondering the treatment. Obviously, one has to actuallyswallow the medicine and undergo therapy. Likewise, without actively engagingin Centrist practice on all three levels of study, reflection, and meditation, we willnever solve the question of whether it yields the promised result or not. All spec-ulations, theories, and reasonings alone will not do. As in the example of choco-late chip cookies, we will not experience their taste by just studying recipes.In other words, Centrism does not bother about some universal truth orabstract validity. Rather, true reality or validity always has to be experienced by amind. If the Centrist approach is helpful for individual beings to end the delusionin their minds, in terms of the individual experiences of these beings, this is all thatis needed and all that counts. Even if there might be more sophisticated views ortheories, if they fail to remove our suffering, what are they good for? In this way,the Centrist approach is very pragmatic and hinges entirely on personal experience.This also implies that we do not have to wait until perfect Buddhahood to expe-rience any effect of this approach in our lives. When we actively engage in it, Cen-trism isa way of life whose validity is constantly put to the test in our everydayexistence. It is not just some spiritual crossword puzzle that is to be solved some-where up in the clouds. When we apply the Centrist outlook down here on earth,such experiences as every little bit of relaxing our rigid ways of behaving towardthe world and ourselves, every little bit of developing more insight into what actu-ally is going on in the situations that we encounter, and every tiny little flower ofcompassion that starts blossoming in our mind can be seen as a result of being onthis path. Thus, there are both immediate and final benefits.The Middle from Beginning to End 217Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 217"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Do Centrists Have a Thesis or Position?The attitude of Centrists toward valid cognition leads to the much-debated ques-tion of whether they have any thesis or position at all.

If something is to be proven as inherently existent, it may beassumed to be established in one of two ways. On the one hand, it could beassumed to be inherently existent by itself, that is, to be completely independentof causes and conditions. The problem here is that this presupposes what has tobe proven in the first place: inherent self-existence. Alternatively, if this somethingis claimed to have arisen from something else that is inherently existent, thenthe inherent existence of this something else would have to be established, whichentails the same problem as above and moreover leads to an infinite regress. Inthe same way, anything that could serve as a reason to establish inherent existenceor refute the lack thereof can only be either inherently existent or lack such exis-tence and thus be empty. If it lacks inherent existence in itself, how could itprove something else to be inherently existent? And if it is assumed to inherentlyexist, this is again just presupposing what has to be proven.Thus, what is called emptiness refers to just the pointing out that all things lackinherent existence. In the context of explaining or debating this, it may conven-tionally be called “the thesis of emptiness.” However, as was made clear above,neither the means to point this out, nor its result, nor the process as such is reallyexistent. Thus, they all concord with this “thesis” that all things lack inherent exis-tence. Since both the means to point out emptiness and any hypothetical objec-tions lack inherent existence, whatever one may say or think always just pointsback to this very same actuality that everything lacks an intrinsic nature and thatthere are no reference points whatsoever. In this way, inevitably, the very attemptto prove or disprove anything in the sense of “that’s how it really is” is self-inval-idating and self-contradictory. It is just a further entanglement in the web ofdualistic thinking instead of a means to step out of it.528Candrakırti’s Entranceinto Centrism says:“Does the means to invalidate invalidate what is to be invalidated with-out encountering it,Or does it do so by encountering it?” This flaw that you already men-tionedWould certainly apply to someone who has a thesis, but we do nothave this thesis.Hence, it is impossible that this consequence [applies to us].529His autocommentary specifies this: As far as Centrist “theses” in the abovesense of lacking real existence are concerned, the means to invalidate does notinvalidate what is to be invalidated either by connecting with it or by not con-necting with it, because both the means to invalidate and what is to be invalidated220The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 220"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"are not established by their nature. Therefore, the above question would applyonly to someone who has a thesis that involves the inherent existence of both themeans to invalidate and what is to be invalidated. However, since Centrists do nothave such theses, they do not conceive of this process of invalidation in terms ofan encounter or no encounter between the means to invalidate and what is to beinvalidated.530Thus, it seems that Candrakırti does not disclaim that Centristsexpress “theses” in the sense of just pointing out emptiness or making pedagogicstatements merely from the perspective of others. In fact, in all Centrist texts,one finds not only absurd consequences or negations of other positions but alsonumerous statements of a conventionally propositional nature, such as “Thenature of cyclic existence is the nature of nirv› ̊a” or “Without seeming reality theultimate cannot be realized.” However, what Candrakırti and all other Centristsdefinitely deny is that they have any thesis that involves real existence or referencepoints or any thesis that is to be defended from their own point of view.The Eighth Karmapa gives the example that the appearance of floating hairsfor a person with blurred vision in no way affects the sight of someone withoutsuch a visual impairment. Likewise, when Centrists give a conventional, expe-dient presentation of seeming causes and results on the level of no analysis, howcould any critique that is based on causes and results that are regarded as hav-ing a nature of their own ever affect the actual lack of such a nature? Therefore,the Eighth Karmapa says, all objections to emptiness by realists are onlyprompted by their own limited outlook. They cannot help thinking that Cen-trists definitely must claim the opposite of what they themselves assert. Theyenter the dispute by assuming that, just like themselves, the Centrists too holdon to things such as theses of their own and others, something to be provenand the means to prove it, something that is to be invalidated and the means toinvalidate it. Thus, all attempts by realists to refute Centrists only mean that theydid not at all understand the meaning of emptiness in the way that Centrists tryto convey it. In this way, realists basically just debate with their own thoughtsas opponents.The crucial point here and in Centrism in general is that inherent existence issimply an incoherent notion altogether that does not withstand analysis. What iscalled emptiness is just the result of pointing out this fact. In other words, whetherone conventionally speaks of “the thesis of emptiness” or says, “I have no thesis,”both expressions just announce and highlight the Centrist procedure of demon-strating that all things lack inherent existence—that there are no reference points.Needless to say, such a “thesis of emptiness” is nothing to hold on to either. TheKarmapa quotes his guru, the great siddha Sangye Nyenba Rinpoche:All you people who assert scriptures and reasoningsThat prove a real identityThe Middle from Beginning to End 221Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 221"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Are very much afraid of the notion that there is no real identityAnd thus perform all kinds of pointless negations and proofs.Once you do not cling to either of these two thesesOf a real identity or the lack of a real identity,All disputes of negation and proof will subside.Then there is no harm even through billions of scriptures andreasonings.531The Second Shamarpa Kachö Wangbo says:No matter how excellent a view in a scriptural tradition might be,It is mistaken when compared to the actual basic nature.532The same applies to reasoning: No matter how excellent reasonings or thesesthat are established through valid cognition might be, ultimately, they conflictwith the basic nature and thus are just a road to perdition.Moreover, in terms of Centrists merely pronouncing what conventionallylooks like a thesis, one must differentiate between Centrists in different situations.The most fundamental distinction here is twofold: 1) those Centrists who rest in the meditative equipoise of directly seeing thenature of phenomena2) all other Centrists (those in meditative equipoise who do not directly realizethis nature, as well as all those who are in the phase of subsequent attainment).With regard to those who directly realize emptiness, the question of having athesis or not simply does not apply, since all mental reference points are com-pletely at peace in such a realization. As for the others, as mentioned earlier, theEighth Karmapa distinguishes four possibilities in terms of persons who upholdthe Centrist view and persons who have realized it. There are the following: a) people who uphold the Centrist view and in whose continua its realizationhas not arisenb) those in whose continua its realization has arisen and who do not uphold theCentrist viewc) those for whom both is the cased) those for whom neither is the caseIt is clear that persons (b) and (d) are not relevant here, since the former donot profess to be Centrists and the latter are not Centrists in any way. This leaves222The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 222"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"persons (a) and (c) as the ones who may point out to appropriate people in appro-priate situations that all things lack a nature of their own, which may be called“the thesis of emptiness.” As the First Sangye Nyenba Rinpoche says:As for the presentation of the two realities that are set up in dependence,We pronounce it merely from the perspective of the worldly consensus of others.Now, once you are free from mundane discursiveness,All negations and affirmations of existence, nonexistence, being, and not beingIn terms of all characteristics of arising and ceasingThrough such [criteria] as reality and falsity of dependent phenomenaAre at peace in the sense that they are not observable.In this state, how could there be any view or meditation of our ownsystem?Once a philosophical system that is our own system has vanished,It is meaningless to refute other systems.Therefore, do not even use the label of Madhyamaka.533Karmapa Mikyö Dorje summarizes this issue by saying that, on both the seem-ing and the ultimate level, Centrists do not have any thesis of their own in thesense of something to defend in debate or something that would represent theirown standpoint or the position in which they themselves believe. For, if some-one claims something or clings to it, that person is not a Centrist in the firstplace but inevitably has fallen into some extreme through still having a referencepoint. Furthermore, even on the conventional or seeming level, Centrists refer tosuch expressions as “emptiness” or “all phenomena are mere dependent origina-tion” in a way that is free from all reference points and clinging to referencepoints. Such pronouncements are in no way meant to increase any kind of cling-ing, since whatever is not free from clinging or even increases it is not suitable asthe Centrist path. And if something is not the Centrist path, it is not appropri-ate as the means to pacify all reference points.Thus, although Centrists have no thesis or position, from the perspective ofothers, they still talk about mere names, mere designations, and mere conventions(such as existence, nonexistence, both, and neither; dependent origination; oremptiness). To do so does not contradict having no thesis, since this very way ofspeaking is the means to make others comprehend the profound actuality that iswithout any positions or clinging to reference points. For example, people withblurred vision see various delusive appearances and take them to be really exis-tent. In order to put an end to the clinging that these appearances are real, otherpeople with clear vision may say to them, “You surely see such appearances asThe Middle from Beginning to End 223Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 223"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"floating hairs, but none of them exists in the way they appear to you.” Clearly,in order for those with clear vision to make such a statement, it is not necessarythat floating hairs and such appear to them on the conventional level.So when Centrists like N›g›rjuna and ⁄›ntideva conventionally speak about“my thesis,” “the thesis of emptiness,” or a “position,”534they do not at all referto any principle, doctrine, or proposition of their own. Such words are just usedas nominal expressions that conform with debate terminology and reasoning asthese are agreed upon by others. Thus, such expressions as “the thesis of empti-ness” can be understood as a kind of metalanguage that just recalls and epitomizesthe whole process of demonstrating that things lack inherent existence. This issimilar to when Centrists use the term “nature” in a twofold sense, meaning “anintrinsic and independent nature of entities” as opposed to “the actual or ultimatenature of entities,” which is that they have no nature in the first sense.535In thesame way, “the thesis of emptiness” in the sense of just pointing out that thereare no reference points per se excludes any notion of thesis in the usual sense, thatof a statement that is based on and expresses one’s own reference points. Thisaccords with what Patsab Lots›wa reportedly said on this issue:In the declaration that [Centrists] do not have a position, there is nocontradiction, since it [means the following]:They do not have a posi-tion that is proven through positive determination, but it is not thecase that they do not even have a mere position [in the sense] of negat-ing through negative determination.536As was illustrated by the example of the unblurred vision of one person beingunaffected by the blurred vision of someone else, all conventional “theses” suchas “positive actions lead to pleasant results and negative actions cause unpleasantresults” are made exclusively on the level of no analysis and just from the per-spective of others whose wrong ideas are to be dissolved. Thus, they do not affectthe vision of those who have realized emptiness, that is, the true nature of allphenomena, including such conventional explanations. As Padma Karpo’sIllu-mination of Three Centrist Scriptural Systemssays:From the perspective of various individual persons, to give variousteachings for those who are to be guided through various individual[means], everything may be suitable to be asserted, be it existence,nonexistence, or whatever. From the perspective of a Buddha, there isnothing whatsoever to be asserted. These two [perspectives] are notcontradictory.537Lindtner summarizes the whole issue nicely:224The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 224"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Thus on the sa ̇v ̧ti-level [the level of the seeming] we find him[N›g›rjuna] engaged either in demonstrating his own standpoint (i.e.s›dhana), or in refuting that of his opponents (i.e. dÒ ̋a ̊a).

In his own words, he no longer defends the thesis he took so greatpains to defend on the sa ̇v ̧ti-level: that things lack svabh›va. . . .We may now be tempted to ask whether there is a consistency behindthe paradox that N›g›rjuna at the same defends a thesis and also doesnot defend a thesis.. . . In both cases he is concerned with one and the same thing, namelylack of svabh›va. But a difference remains, it is one of outlook, onemight say. On the sa ̇v ̧ti-level he speaks and argues about lack ofsvabh›va as a truth (an ultimate truth). On the param›rtha-level he isstill concerned with the same thing (or rather nothing) but here onecannot speak about it. Here it has become reality, as it were.The distinction (bheda) between truthand realityis solely a questionof whether the medium of language is present or not. One can speakthe truth, but one cannot possibly speak the reality. At the best onecan, as N›g›rjuna points out, “suggest,” or “allude” to reality by meansof prajñapti, or indications.The final problem, then, is to get “beyond” language—beyond pra-pañca[discursiveness] as N›g›rjuna would say.There is no theoretical solution to this problem. Theoretical solutionscan, at best, offer us truth, not reality. . . .Of param›rthaone cannot speak; it is a matter of belief and personalexperience (aparapratyaya). Much less can one speak of its relation-ship to anything, viz. sa ̇v ̧ti. One must learn to remain satisfied withmere indications—prajñapti.538It is important to clearly note that having no thesis or reference point is notjust a clever or elusive move in debate. Rather, its main significance lies again inThe Middle from Beginning to End 225Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 225"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"its soteriological effect of liberation from any clinging and the ensuing afflic-tions.

For example, Bh›vaviveka says that it is inappropriate to not presentone’s own system and only negate the systems of others, since such a style of dis-putation amounts to nothing but sophistry and mere deceitful destructiveness.Also, if one’s own positions—emptiness, nonarising, and so on—are not estab-lished through valid cognition, then one cannot negate the views of others merelyby flinging consequences at their positions (such as their claim of inherently aris-ing and existing things). Moreover, one cannot prove the view of one’s own sys-tem through reasons that are asserted only by others and not by oneself. For thesethree reasons, certain positions must be asserted that represent one’s own systemand are established through valid cognition, such as the Centrist arguments andexamples that prove nonarising in a conventional context.Consequentialists answer: It may well be that some people have their own claimsand then do not present their own system out of fear of other people’s critique orthat they negate the systems of others with hostile intentions through merely set-ting up absurd consequences. In such cases one can rightfully speak of a style ofdebating that involves hypocrisy and deceit and ends up being mere sophistry andunfair destructiveness. However, we cannot be accused of such, since we neitherset up anything in the sense that there exists something to be set up as our own the-sis, nor do we negate anything in the sense that there exists something to be negatedas the theses of others. If we do not have the slightest thesis of our own that is tobe set up, then what is the point of all this toil to search for a means to prove it? Actually, as explained above, the Centrist approach is not even a negation ofsomething. If one could observe even the minutest existent phenomenon to benegated, it would certainly be appropriate to negate it. However, if one cannotobserve anything to be negated, who would want to speak of negation here? AsN›g›rjuna says in his Precious Garland: 226The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 226"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Through destruction or a remedy,Being existent would become nonexistence.[However,] since [real] existence is impossible,How could there be [its] destruction or remedy?540In his Entrance Gate for the Learned,541Sakya Pa ̊ ̃ita gives the following exam-ple: Just negating while not asserting anything as a kind of deceitful tactic maybe compared to not acknowledging that a theft that has been committed. On theother hand, Consequentialist negation and nonassertion is like nonacknowledg-ment of a theft when no theft has been committed in the first place. Thus, thereis a great difference between these two approaches.Nevertheless, conventionally speaking, from the point of view of delusiveappearances, or from the perspective of the subsequent attainment that is informedby preceding meditative equipoise, Centrists not only follow ordinary commonconsensus but also employ specific Buddhist conventions, such as the two reali-ties, karma, and the stages of the path. For these are the conventional means totranscend the root cause of suffering: the clinging to mere delusive appearances asreal. On the other hand, that Consequentialists do not defend such conventionsin debate by trying to actually establish or affirm something—not even empti-ness—is the expression of the core of their approach, that is, leading others tofreedom from reference points and not creating more. Thus, all that Centrists sayand teach in their communications with others is always applied as a pedagogictool that is adapted to the individual perspectives of other people. None of this isapprehended or put forward by Centrists as any system of their own in any way.In this context, it has to be clearly understood that the above objections byBh›vaviveka refer only to the situation of communicating emptiness or ultimatereality to others. In actuality, Autonomists such as Bh›vaviveka also aim at noth-ing but freedom from discursiveness and reference points. Some people say thatthere is a slight remainder of discursiveness or affirmation in the ultimate viewof Autonomists. The Eighth Karmapa argues that this is not the case, because thetexts of Autonomists are even clearer than the texts of Candrakırti in their wayof teaching freedom from discursiveness. He quotes ⁄›ntarak ̋ita’sOrnament ofCentrism:Because [“nonarising”] concords with the ultimate,It is called the ultimate.In actuality, it is the releaseFrom all complexes of discursiveness.Since arising and so forth do not exist,Nonarising and so on are impossible.The Middle from Beginning to End 227Center Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 227"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Since their nature has been negated,Their verbal terms are impossible.There is no good formulaTo negate nonexistent objects.[Nonarising and such] depend on conceptionsAnd thus are seeming, not actual.542and Jñ›nagarbha’sDistinction between the Two Realities:Since the negation of arising and so onConcords with actuality, we accept it.Since there is nothing to be negated,It is clear that, actually, there is no negation.How should the negation of an imputation’sOwn nature not be an imputation?Hence, seemingly, this isThe meaning of actuality, but not actuality [itself].In actuality, neither exists.This is the lack of discursiveness:MañjuŸrı asked about actuality,And the son of the Victors remained silent.543Further examples of this stance include Bh›vaviveka’s Summary of the Meaningof Centrism:The ultimate is freedom from discursiveness.Being empty of all discursivenessIs to be understoodAs the nonnominal ultimate.544His Heart of Centrismagrees:Its character is neither existent, nor nonexistent,Nor [both] existent and nonexistent, nor neither.Centrists should know true realityThat is free from these four possibilities.545228The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-01:Center Sunlit-01 6/30/09 9:35 AM Page 228"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"His Lamp of Knowledgesays:This negation “[entities do] not [arise] from themselves” is to beregarded as having the meaning of a non-implicative negation.

If it were taken to be an implicativenegation, since that is primarily an affirmation, it would teach non-arising by affirming that “phenomena are non-arisen.” Hence, it wouldbe distinct from [our] conclusion, since the scriptures say, “If oneengages in the non-arising of form, one does not engage in the per-fection of knowledge.”546andHere, the purpose of emptiness is its characteristic of all discursive-ness being at utter peace. The characteristic that emptiness is free fromall clinging represents the wisdom that observes emptiness. The actu-ality of emptiness is its characteristic of suchness.547KamalaŸıla’s Establishing That All Phenomena Are without Natureexplains:Since this lack of arising is concordant with realizing the ultimate, it iscalled “the ultimate.” Since there is no object of negation, such as aris-ing, that is established, [its] lack [cannot really] be related to this non-existent object. Therefore, to apprehend the lack of arising and such isnothing but a reference point. . . . Ultimately, true reality cannot beexpressed as the lack of arising and such. Therefore, Noble MañjuŸrıasked about true reality and Noble Vimalakırti said nothing.548And his Stages of Meditationsays:Thus, at the time when yogic practitioners examine through theirsupreme knowledge and do not observe any nature of entities what-soever, thoughts about entities do not originate in them. They do nothave any thoughts about nonentities either. If there were any entity tobe seen, then, by negating [this entity], the thought of “nonentity”would come up. However, when yogic practitioners examine with theireyes of supreme knowledge, they do not observe any entity within thethree times. At this point, through negating what [entity] would theyentertain a thought of “nonentity”?

The reasons for this are as follows: The two [kindsof] thoughts about existents and nonexistents include all [possible]thoughts. Also, since [actually] there is nothing that includes anything,there is also nothing to be included. This is the genuine yoga of non-conceptuality. Since in yogic practitioners dwelling in it all thoughtshave vanished, they perfectly relinquish afflictive obscurations and cog-nitive obscurations.549Thus, Karmapa Mikyö Dorje says that there is actually only one single differ-ence between Autonomists and Consequentialists. In general, it is just on theconventional level that both refute wrong ideas through explaining the words ofthe Buddha, composing treatises on them, and debating with others. In this con-ventional context, Consequentialists say that the scriptures and reasonings usedto refute wrong views do not even conventionally have the nature of valid cog-nition or the like and thus lack any real nature that could refute their opposite,which is to say nonvalid cognition. Nevertheless, they simply follow and repeatthe verbal consensus on valid cognition that is agreed upon by others. Based onthis approach, they negate phenomena that are not even established on the levelof correct seeming worldly reality, let alone ultimately. Autonomists agree that,ultimately, the arguments and such that refute wrong ideas do not have a naturethat is ultimately established as valid cognition. However, they argue that, whenrefuting wrong ideas on the conventional level, if one does not conventionallyaccept that arguments and such are established through valid cognition, thewrong ideas of realists cannot be refuted.The Karmapa emphasizes that it is merely this difference that led to the dis-tinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists. However, this does notmean that there are any differences in terms of one of these views being more pro-found or better than the other, since both equally accept the complete freedomfrom discursiveness and reference points. Moreover, not even the omniscience ofa Buddha could see any difference in terms of better or worse between theapproaches that they employ in order to put an end to discursiveness and refer-ence points. The Karmapa is very explicit that certain other minor divergencesbetween the approaches of Autonomists and Consequentialists are just of expe-dient meaning. They in no way justify making a difference in terms of the pro-fundity of their view in terms of the ultimate. In particular, there are no groundsfor basing elaborate outlines of two distinct Centrist systems—as they are foundin some (mostly later) Tibetan doxographies—on such an assumed difference inprofundity.550230The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 230"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"The Middle from Beginning to End 231Illusory Lions Killing Illusory Elephants: Empty Reasonings for LiberationSome Essential Points of Centrist ReasoningThe root of all Centrist arguments is the praise to the Buddha that N›g›rjunaproclaims at the very beginning of his Fundamental Verses on Centrism:I bow down to the perfect Buddha,The supreme orator, who taughtThat dependent originationIs without ceasing and without arising,Without extinction and without permanence,Without coming and without going,Not different and not one.It is the peace in which discursiveness is at complete peace.Accordingly, there are four root arguments:1) Outer and inner entities are without ceasing in the end and without abidingin the middle, because they do not arise in the first place.2) Outer and inner entities are without extinction, because there is no perma-nence.3) Outer and inner entities are without coming, because going is not established.4) Outer and inner entities are not established as different, because there is noentity that is one.All other Madhyamaka arguments, such as the five great Centrist reasonings,derive from these four basic arguments. It is said that the negation of the eightreference points—arising, ceasing, permanence, extinction, going, coming, one-ness, and difference—in the opening verses of The Fundamental Versesrepresentsa brief synopsis of both this treatise and Centrist reasoning in general. For thenegation of oneness and difference is nothing other than the reasoning of thefreedom from unity and multiplicity, while the six other negations of arising andso on primarily depend on the negation of oneness and difference. There arethree essential steps in all these reasonings that analyze for the ultimate:1) One picks a certain phenomenon, such as a book, as one’s basis of attributionor analysis.2) One searches for a nature of this phenomenon that is not self-contradictory.3) Within this basis of attribution, one looks for something, such as its attributes,that is contradictory to its nature.Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 231"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Hence, from among all Centrist arguments, the following two are the mainreasonings in that they respectively correspond to steps (2) and (3):a) the reasoning of the freedom from unity and multiplicity in order to analyzea natureb) the vajra sliver reasoning in order to analyze the attributesThe many other enumerations of arguments that are explained in Centristtexts are merely branches of these two reasonings. In particular, the reasoning ofthe freedom from unity and multiplicity is the root of all reasonings that negatereal existence.These reasonings are explained in detail below, but to briefly illustrate theabove three essential points, we may start, for example, by taking a book as theobject of our analysis. When searching for the book’s nature, initially, we mightthink that it really exists and that it is its nature to be a real unity. However, suchan assumed nature of being a unity is self-contradictory, since a book can be bro-ken down into infinitely many parts. If we then think that the book must be areal multiplicity, this is also self-contradictory, since we cannot find any real uni-ties in it that could serve as building blocks for a real multiplicity. And sincethere is no third possibility for the book to really exist, we have to admit that theonly nature of this book that is not self-contradictory is that it does not existeither as a real unity or as a real multiplicity. In other words, the book does notreally exist altogether. Finally, we look for possible attributes of this book—suchas that it really arises—that are contradictory to its nature of lacking real existence.This means that if we were to find some real arising of the book, this would obvi-ously contradict its nature of lacking real existence. However, under analysis, wewill find that the book does not really arise from itself, nor from something other,nor from both itself and something other, and also not without any cause. Insummary, the book does not really arise at all, which perfectly well accords withits nature of lacking real existence. In this way, the nature of this book (its lackof real existence) and its attribute (its lack of real arising) are found neither to beself-contradictory nor to contradict each other.Although the actual Centrist reasonings always negate, their point is not tonegate away something that really exists, since something really existent cannot benegated anyway. They also do not remove or negate something nonexistent. Sincea nonexistent cannot be an object, there is no object to which to refer in the firstplace. “Negating” just means to demonstrate that things do not exist in the realand solid way that we think they do. Thus, the object of negation of reasoning isnot something that does not exist anyway (such as a truly existing nature ofthings). Technically, the object of negation is merely the mental image thatappears for the reifying conceptions of people who mistakenly believe in the exis-232The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 232"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"tence of what does not exist. Therefore, as far as Centrists are concerned, “real exis-tence” is just something that occurs in a psychological or subjective sense but cer-tainly does not exist in any ontological or objective sense. Consequently, the forceof Centrist negation strikes only the realm of our fixed ideas and not somethingthat would appear on any hypothetical level of real or substantial existence. More-over, as was elaborated above, the words and concepts in Centrist reasonings areas unreal as the words and concepts that they negate. However, from our mentalperspective, they still serve their purpose of making us let go of our rigid ideas.Centrist reasonings do not negate mere seeming arising or existence in a categor-ical way, nor do they take away the possibility of conventionally experiencingboth single and many things in our everyday lives. Instead, these reasonings tacklethe wrong notions of real arising, real existence, real unity, and real multiplicity.As for the actual techniques of reasoned analysis, the standard framework offormulating Centrist reasonings is to present dilemmas or even tetralemmas ofmutually exclusive and exhaustive possibilities for something, such as existenceor arising, which then are refuted one by one. For example, the reasoning of thefreedom from unity and multiplicity is presented as a dilemma, that is, reallyexisting things can only exist as a real unity or as a real multiplicity. There is nothird possibility, since all existing phenomena are included in these two mutu-ally exclusive and exhaustive categories of existence.From among the five Centrist reasonings, the three reasonings that negate realarising go even further and investigate four possible ways of arising, such as whetherthings arise from themselves, from something other, from both, or from neither,which is to say, without any cause. These four possibilities are mutually exclusiveand cover all theoretically imaginable ways in which things might arise.551Thus,through the refutation of each one of these possibilities, it is shown that things donot really arise at all. The same principle is applied to other issues, such as whethera cause produces a result that is already existent, nonexistent, both, or neither;whether an object exists before, after, or simultaneously with the consciousness thatperceives it; and whether some assumed productive potential in a cause is identicalto the cause or different from it. On the not so serious side of things, probably theshortest summary of this approach is to say that the classic Madhyamaka statementto which all others can be reduced is “neither nor, nor neither.”Within this framework of analysis, its actual result—elimination of reifica-tion—can be achieved either through using formal probative arguments with thethree modes of a correct reason (also called “autonomous reasoning”) or throughdrawing unwanted consequences from other people’s positions. Somewhat sim-plified, one could say that autonomous reasoning in this sense refers to any pro-bative argument with the correct three modes that says “how things are” (eitherconventionally or ultimately). On the other hand, absurd consequences do nothave all three—or even none—of the correct modes, whether they include a rea-The Middle from Beginning to End 233Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 233"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"son or not. This means that they are just consequences that follow from anotherposition that is already wrong in the first place. Thus, they are logically correct,but their explicit meaning must be false, since it is just an absurd result of a pre-vious false statement.For example, if someone holds that a vase is permanent, this wrong notion maybe dispelled by stating what is correct and giving a proper reason for it, such as “Avase is notpermanent, because it arises from causes and conditions and thus mustdisintegrate at some point (such as now when I let it drop).” Here, the three modesare established. Alternatively, one may draw absurd consequences from the posi-tion that a vase is permanent, such as saying, “Then it follows that a vase neitherarises in the first place nor ceases to exist later.” Obviously, in this consequence,the question of the three modes does not apply, since there is no reason. Some-times the opponent’s position is added as the reason to such a consequence, suchas by saying, “It follows that a vase does not arise and cease, because—accordingto your claim—it is permanent.” In that case, from the perspective of the oppo-nent, all three modes are established, since a vase is claimed to be permanent andwhatever is permanent necessarily does not arise and cease. Therefore, the oppo-nent must accept this unwanted consequence of his or her position. From theperspective of correct worldy conventions, when regarding a vase as an imperma-nent phenomenon, only the second and third modes are established (which is pre-cisely the correct but, in relation to such an impermanent phenomenon, absurdconsequence that whatever is permanent necessarily does not arise and cease).From the perspective of Centrists, ultimately also this is not established, since nei-ther a vase nor something permanent exists and thus cannot be said either to ariseand cease or not to. There are also many consequences in which all three modesare not even conventionally established, for example, the consequence “It followsthat things do not arise from themselves, since their arising would be pointless andendless” that is drawn from the assertion that things arise from themselves.552All Centrists agree and emphasize that their formulations of negations orabsurd consequences in no way imply their reverses or anything else, for thatmatter. Thus, they are all exclusively nonimplicative negations. For example, tostate, “Things do not arise from something other, since then everything couldarise from everything”553does not imply that things either arise from themselves,from both themselves and others, or without a cause. This is further evidencedby the fact that Centrists explicitly negate all of these possibilities one by one, andthere is no fifth possibility.Another characteristic feature of Centrist reasonings is that they often analyzethings in terms of infinitesimal parts and moments in time. For example, in thereasoning of the freedom from unity and multiplicity, one seeks for the final,smallest parts of things that could represent a hypothetical indivisible unity. Mostof the arguments and consequences in the context of the three great Centrist rea-234The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 234"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"sonings that negate arising are formulated in terms of the individual moments ofthe process of causality, such as considering the relationship between the lastmoment of the cause that immediately precedes the first moment of its specificresult or whether there exists any simultaneous moment of cause and result dur-ing which there is some causal interaction between them.As for the interaction of this approach of negating mutually exclusive andexhaustive alternatives with the subjective side of our mind that grapples withsuch reasonings, Centrists just utilize the natural structure of our black-and-whitethinking, since this is precisely the way in which dualistic clinging operates. Usu-ally, when we find that something does not exist or is not permanent, we imme-diately think that it then must be nonexistent or impermanent. On thechecker board of our dualistic mind that is grounded in really existing things, thismay make sense in that the exclusion of one of these possibilities necessarily impliesthe presence of the other. However, from the perspective of the Centrist view ofall appearances’ fundamental lack of any real existence, all such possibilities aspermanent, impermanent, existent, and nonexistent are just vain attempts by ourdualistic fixation to hold on to something within the infinite openness of mind’snatural expanse, which cannot be boxed in in any way. In other words, Centristreasonings beat our fixating mind with its own weapons. When dualistic mindprogressively analyzes its own dualistic structure and function, this inevitably leadsto its own collapse altogether. When it sees all its reference points dwindle, includ-ing itself as that which creates these reference points, it simply goes out of busi-ness. Thus, the radical and relentless use of Centrist dilemmas and tetralemmas isa deliberate, systematic, and—in a sense—therapeutic technique to pull each pieceof the patchwork of our two-dimensional referential carpet from under our feetand explore the nondimensional, boundless space of mind’s true nature.Disillusionment with Phenomenal IdentityThe Five Great Madhyamaka ReasoningsIn general, various Centrist masters present many different arguments that deter-mine phenomenal identitylessness. In the system of N›g›rjuna and his spiritualheirs, these are mainly “the five great Centrist reasonings”:1) the negation through the analysis of an intrinsic nature: the reasoning of free-dom from unity and multiplicity2) the negation through the analysis of causes: the vajra sliver reasoning5543) the negation through the analysis of results: the reasoning that negates an aris-ing of existents and nonexistents4) the negation through the analysis of both causes and results: the reasoningthat negates arising from the four possibilitiesThe Middle from Beginning to End 235Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 235"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"5) the analysis of mere appearances: the reasoning of dependent originationScriptural Sources for the Five Great ReasoningsAs for their scriptural references in the sÒtras, the first of these reasonings is, forexample, found in The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºka,555the second in The RiceSeedling SÒtra,556and the fifth in The SÒtra Requested by the N›g› King “The CoolOne”557as well as in The SÒtra on Dependent Origination.558The third and fourthreasonings are found in various other sÒtras.In Centrist treatises, the reasoning of the freedom from unity and multiplic-ity is extensively explained in both ⁄›ntarak ̋ita’s Ornament of Centrism559and⁄rıgupta’s (seventh century) Commentary on Entering True Reality. It is also usedin N›g›rjuna’sSeventy Stanzas on Emptiness,560firyadeva’s Four Hundred Verses,561and the first volume of KamalaŸıla’s Stages of Meditation.562The explanation of the vajra sliver reasoning is one of the main themes inN›g›rjuna’s Fundamental Versesand also forms the major portion of the sixthchapter of Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrism. It is taught in detail in the ninthchapter of ⁄›ntideva’s Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life563and also pre-sented in KamalaŸıla’s Stages of Meditation.564As for the negation of the arising of existents and nonexistents, it is taught inthe three just-mentioned texts by N›g›rjuna,565Candrakırti,566and ⁄›ntideva.567It is also mentioned in The Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness.568The negation of arising from the four possibilities is found in Jñ›nagarbha’sDistinction between the Two Realities569and explained in detail in its autocom-mentary570and the subcommentary by ⁄›ntarak ̋ita571as well as in Haribhadra’sIllumination of The Ornament of Clear Realization.572It is also used in KamalaŸıla’sIllumination of Centrism573and his Establishing that all Phenomena are WithoutNature.574The reasoning of dependent origination is the major theme of N›g›rjuna’sSeventy Stanzas on Emptiness. It also appears in his Rebuttal of Objections,575inSixty Stanzas on Reasoning,576in several chapters of his Fundamental Verses,577andin Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrism.578The first known summary of four of these five reasonings (excepting thefourth) is found in Bh›vaviveka’s Summary of the Meaning of Centrism(lines14–17). Later, AtıŸa gave a more detailed overview of the same four reasonings inhis autocommentary on verses 48–52 of The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment.579KamalaŸıla explains all five in his Illumination of Centrism.580The Detailed Explanation of the Five Great ReasoningsTogether, these reasonings refute the extremes of existence and nonexistence.Since our clinging to real existence is far stronger than our clinging to nonexis-tence, the first four reasonings eliminate the imputation that things exist by their236The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 236"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"own nature. Therefore, they all serve to relinquish the first extreme of existence.The fifth reasoning simultaneously eliminates the extremes of existence andnonexistence. Moreover, it induces certainty about the unity of emptiness anddependent origination.In what follows, these five reasonings are explained through a three-part rea-soning (inference for oneself) and the three modes of a correct reason that wereexplained above. To reiterate, each such reasoning has a subject, a predicate, anda reason. Its validity is tested by checking the three modes of subject property,positive entailment, and negative entailment.I. The analysis of a nature: the reasoning of freedom from unity and multiplicity A. The formulation of the reasoningAll phenomena—such as sprouts—do not really exist, because they lack unity andmultiplicity, just as a reflection in a mirror.B. The three modes of the reasonThe subject of this reasoning is just mere appearances without examination andanalysis. The subject propertythat applies to this subject is as follows: These mereappearances are not a real unity, because they possess many parts. Each of theseparts can in turn be broken down into many subparts. Since this process can beinfinitely repeated, there is not a single smallest particle that is a really existentand indivisible unity. Without even one real building block, how could you puttogether many so as to create a really existent thing? Consequently, there can benothing that is a real multiplicity, because there is no real unity to begin with thatcould build up such a multiplicity. To be sure, this reasoning does not negate themere conventionality that one thing has many parts. The point here is that nei-ther the thing in question nor its parts really exist by themselves. Thus, what isdenied is not the mere appearance of unity and multiplicity on the level of seem-ing reality but the existence of any unity or multiplicity that is really establishedand findable as such.For example, our body consists of its head, torso, and limbs. The legs can befurther broken down into the thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet. The feet canbe divided into the heel, the toes, and so on. The toes are just an assembly of sin-gle knuckles consisting of bone, cartilage, blood vessels, and so forth. Examiningthe microscopic level of each of these constituents, one arrives at their molecu-lar, atomic, and subatomic structures.At various points in this process, different Buddhists and non-Buddhists claimthat there are smallest (sub)atomic particles that cannot be broken down further.Thus, what is particularly refuted through this reasoning is the existence of suchinfinitesimal particles, which often are regarded as partless and dimensionless,The Middle from Beginning to End 237Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 237"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"similar to a mathematical point. In addition, they are said to be the buildingblocks of all coarse material phenomena. However, if these particles do not haveany parts or spatial extensions, they cannot aggregate with others of their kind,since there are no surfaces or sides to contact anything else. Also, even many suchdimensionless particles could never add up to some larger phenomenon that isperceptible by our senses, since even a million times zero spatial extension is stillzero spatial extension. On the other hand, if these particles could align with oth-ers in order to build up larger three-dimensional things, they would have to haveat least six sides—front, rear, left, right, top, and bottom—to allow for any formof contact with other particles in order to create a three-dimensional object. This,however, contradicts the claim that these particles are partless and extensionless.Thus, since no indivisible units or smallest possible particles can be found, thereare no real multiplicities of phenomena that are built by them.581The positive entailmenthere means that the reason (whatever lacks real unityand multiplicity) may only be found in the homologous set of the predicate(everything that does not really exist). In other words, whatever is neither a realunity nor a real multiplicity must necessarily not really exist. The reverse of this—the negative entailment—is that if something really exists,582then it must neces-sarily be either a real unity or a real multiplicity, because unity and multiplicityare mutually exclusive and there is no third possibility. This is the law of theexcluded middle that is accepted by all realists.From among the three doors to liberation, this reasoning teaches the door ofemptiness.II. The analysis of causes: the vajra sliver reasoningThe vajra sliver reasoning bears this name because—just as a vajra is indestructi-ble and at the same time capable of destroying everything else—it is able to shat-ter the huge rock mountain of wrong views that cling to real existence, whilebeing completely unassailable itself. It is explained as it is found in The Funda-mental Verses on Centrism:Not from themselves, not from something other,Not from both, and not without a cause—At any place and any time,All entities lack arising.583Three of these four possibilities of arising are refuted by all Buddhist texts thatdeal with Centrism or valid cognition in general.584These positions are exempli-fied by the Indian non-Buddhist schools of the Enumerators, who assert thatthings arise from themselves; the Jainas, who assert that things arise from boththemselves and something other; and the Mundanely Minded, who assert that238The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 238"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"there is no cause. The fourth possibility of things arising from something other—the position of most other Buddhist and non-Buddhist schools—is refutedthrough Centrist texts alone.The vajra sliver reasoning analyzes arising by taking the example of a seed (thecause) growing into a sprout (the result) and investigating their exact relationship.For example, we will search for the precise time when the seed is no longer aseed and becomes a sprout instead.A. The formulation of the reasoningA sprout is without arising, because it is without arising from itself, from others,from both, and from neither, just like an appearance in a dream.B. The three modes of the reasonThe positiveand negative entailmentcannot go beyond these four extremes ofarising: Whatever does not arise from itself, from something other, from both,or from neither (that is, without any cause) necessarily does not arise at all. Onthe other hand, if things were to arise, they necessarily would have to arise eitherfrom themselves, from something other, from both, or from neither. There areno other possibilities. This is the case whether one looks at it from the perspec-tive of analyzing for real existence or just in terms of mere arising. It should beclear, however, that this reasoning does not deny the mere appearance of some-thing arising on the bare experiential level, where, because of ignorance, it seemsas though things arise.Here, establishing the subject propertyhas four parts, since there are four pos-sibilities of arising to be negated.1. Establishing the reason that entities do not arise from themselvesThe classic example in Centrist texts for people who assert that things arise fromthemselves are the Enumerators. They claim, “A sprout is merely a manifestationof the sole cosmic cause, which is the permanent primal substance. This reallyexisting primal substance is the sprout’s nature. Therefore, this sprout arises fromits own nature, which is a permanent entity.” By this, they mean that cause andresult are one and the same in terms of their nature, substance, and time.This position, however, leads to absurd consequences. For example, the samething would be both the phenomenon that is produced and the phenomenon thatproduces it. This means that the sprout would be identical to both the primalsubstance and the seed (the latter being just an expression of this primal sub-stance). Furthermore, it would not be justified that the seed from which thesprout has arisen ceases to exist, since this seed is nothing but an expression of thepermanent primal substance. Consequently, the seed would either permanentlyexist or arise all the time. However, if the seed as the cause of the sprout does notThe Middle from Beginning to End 239Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 239"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"cease, then one would not find its result—the sprout—since results can onlyappear after their causes. In addition, if cause and result—seed and sprout—arethe same and if the one arises from the other, the sprout should look exactly thesame as the seed. If the seed, however, loses its own nature and turns into some-thing else—a sprout different in color and shape—it cannot have a real andunchangeable nature of its own.In general, in the context of causality, the result of a specific cause can only beperceived once this cause has ceased. However, if seed and sprout are not differ-ent, once the seed ceases, the sprout should also disappear. Or, once the sproutis visible, the seed too should be visible at the same time. Both possibilities con-tradict the notion of causality altogether. In addition, if things were to arise fromthemselves, all the distinct things that are agents and the objects upon whichthese agents act would be one and the same. Thus, that things arise from them-selves is neither reasonable on the ultimate level nor accepted on the level of con-ventional worldly reality.The Enumerators also say, “In general, only such things that exist already at thetime of their causes arise, whereas previously nonexistent things can never arise.For example, sesame oil comes forth from sesame seeds when they are ground,because it already existed before in the seeds. The reason that sesame oil does notappear from grinding sand is that it does not exist in sand.” The basic assumptionbehind this statement is the impossibility of something arising from nothing.Hence, a result cannot arise later without existing at the time of its specific cause.Moreover, there are no other causes apart from its specific cause either that couldtransform a result that does not exist in the first place into an existent result later.Thus, the Enumerators say, the result must preexist at the time of the cause. However, if things—that is to say, results—arise from themselves alone, itimplicitly follows that they need no other factors for their arising. So why doesone have to struggle to grind sesame seeds or farm, since the harvest already existswhen the seeds are present? In addition, if the result is the same as its cause, whyshould the result arise again, since it exists already? In general, if a thing is not yetpresent, it does not exist as a result. If it is already present, it is pointless for it toarise again. And if the result would still arise even though it exists already, thenit would have to arise endlessly. As Buddhap›lita’s commentary onFundamen-tal VersesI.1 says:Entities do not arise from their own intrinsic nature, because theirarising would be pointless and because they would arise endlessly. Forentities that [already] exist as their own intrinsic nature, there is noneed to arise again. If they were to arise despite existing [already], therewould be no time when they do not arise; [but] that is also not asserted[by the Enumerators].585240The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 240"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"The Enumerators may continue, “There are two different phases in the process ofarising. If a vase is made out of clay, it is the unmanifest vase in its state of being alump of clay—the cause—that arises as a manifest vase—the result—later. Of course,we do not think that the vase that is already clearly manifest as the result arises again.Therefore, there is a difference between these two phases of the vase in that it is eitherclearly manifest or not.”However, if the vase already existed as an entity, it would be utterly pointlessfor it to arise again. On the other hand, if “it” arose from its state of not beingclearly manifest, then it would be nothing other than a nonexistent that newlyarises. Here, the Enumerators do not explicitly assert that the clearly manifestresult as such does not exist at the time of the cause, but this is what follows fromtheir claim that it becomes clearly manifest only later. In fact, they deny that theresult is entirely nonexistent at the time of the cause and that it arises completelyanew. However, implicitly, this is exactly what their position boils down to,because by claiming that the result exists as a potential, they just obscure the dis-tinction between the nonexistence of the result at the time of the cause and itslater existence. Saying that it is not manifest at the time of the cause amounts tosaying that it does not exist. Through talking about “the unmanifest vase in itsstate of being a lump of clay,” the Enumerators simply blend two different thingsinto one, for a lump of clay is clearly not a vase. For one, a lump of clay cannotbe said to be a vase, because it does not manifest as a vase. Nor does an “unman-ifest vase” make sense, because then it would equally follow that it is an unman-ifest cup, an unmanifest statue, or whatever else could be made from that clay.This would lead to the consequence that not only a vase but all these otherunmanifest things too should arise from this one lump of clay.Moreover, if the result existed at the time of the cause, it would have to beobservable at this point. However, from that, it would follow that an apple treecan be perceived in an apple seed or milk in the grass eaten by a cow. One of theclassic consequences is that an ant should carry around an elephant, the elephantbeing the karmic result of the existence as an ant to become manifest in one ofthe ant ́s future rebirths. In fact, the entirety of all infinite results of a given causeover time should then be observable at the same time in this cause. On the otherhand, if the result is not observable at all at the time of the cause, how can it besaid to exist?There is no third alternative of saying that the result is partially existent,although this is precisely what the Enumerators (and many others) try to do bytheir formulation of an “unmanifest vase.” However, even if there were such apartial existence of a vase, what would it look like? Even a partial existence shouldbe observable at the time of the cause, but this is not the case. And if the resultwere partially existent at the time of the cause, where would the lacking portionsof its complete existence come from? In general, it is impossible to identify aThe Middle from Beginning to End 241Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 241"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"distinct point in time at which the result turns from nonexistence into existence.It is also impossible to identify distinct points in time that are related to a grad-ual increase in the result ́s existence, such as “Up to here it exists at about 30 per-cent or 50 percent, and from here onward it exists at 100 percent.” Nor does itmake any sense that the result would leap from some degree of partial existenceto full existence in the next moment. In addition, the most fundamental prob-lem in that respect lies in the Enumerators ́ own claim that the primal substanceas the single and final cosmic cause is not something perceptible in the first place.In a very general sense, when it is said that all manifestations are potentiallypresent in and as the primal substance and just become manifest at certain times,this would lead to the conclusion that all possible future results exist right fromthe very beginning. Furthermore, since all causes and results are said to be iden-tical, at any given point in time, all possible results within the past, present, andfuture of the universe as well as all their causes would have to exist simultaneously.2. Establishing the reason that entities do not arise from something other (the second part of establishing the subject property of the vajra sliver reasoning)Our usual idea about causes and results is that things arise from something otherthan themselves. On the level of worldly seeming reality, both Buddhist andnon-Buddhist realists586say, “We agree that entities do not arise from themselves,but their arising from something other is established through valid cognition.There are reasons for this. Factually concordant types of consciousness arise fromthe four conditions,587and in general most things arise from causal and dominantconditions. Both causes and results are not just mere mental imputations, butthey are established from the object’s own side. The fact that they arise with-stands analysis. You cannot simply reason them away.”There are many reasonings to negate this position, but they are all containedin two:a. Arising from something other is impossible.b. In the context of arising, something other is in itself impossible.a. Arising from something other is impossible.Much confusion regarding what is “same” or “other” comes from our very looseand vague use of these notions, such as saying, “other but still similar or same”or “a little bit other” as opposed to “completely other.” For example, we maythink that, compared to ice, fire is “more other” than water. In the context ofCentrist reasoning, the notion of “other” is as strict and literal as can be: Thingsare either the same or different. Either cause and result are assumed to be iden-tical (as the Enumerators state) or they have to be different, that is, other. There242The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 242"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"is no third possibility. Thus, being other is not a question of degree: Things areother whether they differ in all or in just one of their many features. Thus, all sim-ilar things must necessarily be different from each other, since what is identicalis not similar. In other words, the categories of same and different are mutuallyexclusive and exhaustive.One of the consequences of this clear delineation is that if things could arisefrom causes that are other than themselves, it would absurdly follow that anythingcould arise from anything. For example, deep darkness could originate even frombright light. As The Entrance into Centrismsays:If something were to originate in dependence on something other than it,Well, then utter darkness could spring from flamesAnd everything could arise from everything,Because everything that does not produce [a specific result] is the same inbeing other [than it].588The reasons for this consequence are as follows: If we consider a wheat seed anda rose seed, they are equal in that they are both something other than a rosesprout, and, in terms of real things, their being other than the rose sprout issomething that is established through their own specific natures. Thus, since awheat seed and a rose seed are equally other than a rose sprout, either both or nei-ther of them should be able to produce the rose sprout.We usually think that such phenomena as a rose seed and a rose sprout havea close connection, such as sharing some similarities or being in the same con-tinuum, or that the seed as the specific cause has some causal efficacy or poten-tial to produce the sprout as its specific result. On the other hand, we think thatthere is no such connection between a wheat seed and a rose sprout and even lessso between fire and water or light and darkness. However, none of these notionsof a relation between certain phenomena that we consider as causes and resultssolves the issue of arising from something other. They just perpetuate the mereassumption that things arise from something other: Even if causes and resultsare similar and in the same continuum, or if there were a certain productivepotential in some things—the specific causes—and not in others, this does notchange the basic fact that causes are still other than their results. Thus, the sameconsequences as above apply.Moreover, when analyzed, there is just as much “causal connection” betweena rose seed and a rose sprout as between fire and water: none whatsoever. Forthere is never any time in the process of arising when the cause actually meets theresult so that the cause or its productive potential could have any effect on theresult. As long as the cause exists, the result is not yet present, and as soon as theresult appears, the cause has necessarily ceased. So when would the cause unfoldThe Middle from Beginning to End 243Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 243"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"its productive potential? The cause can obviously not unfold it when the causeitself does not exist. If it were an existent cause that displays this productivepotential, this would still not make the result appear. It cannot appear during theexistence of the cause, since cause and result cannot exist simultaneously. Oth-erwise, they could not function as cause and result in the first place. In order tospeak of causality, the cause has to precede the result.589So if the cause must befirst and cannot exist simultaneously with the result, there is no connectionbetween cause and result and also no chance for a hypothetical productive poten-tial of the cause to bring about or interact with the result, since they never meet.Therefore, eventually, this position of realists that things arise from somethingother entails the self-contradictory consequence that a sprout cannotarise froma seed, because—according to them—seed and sprout are something otherthrough their respective specific natures.b. In the context of arising, something other is impossible.In the context of a result arising from a cause, the notion of “otherness” is alto-gether inappropriate. The reason for this is that in order to speak of two thingsas being other, they must exist at the same time. To elaborate, in terms of oth-erness that is based on really existing and substantial things and does not justrefer to a mental image of something that is not present, there have to be two dis-tinct things in the first place that can be contrasted as being “other.” These canonly be two phenomena that are simultaneously observable as existing in thepresent, such as the left and the right horn of a cow or two persons in the sameroom. This then excludes the possibility of cause and result being other, since theyare by definition never simultaneous.Saying it in reverse, nonsimultaneous things cannot be other. Thus, since theresult is not present at the time when the cause exists, at the time of the cause,there is just one phenomenon (the cause itself) and not two, that is, no result thatcould be identified or perceived as other than this cause. The same principleapplies to the time when the result exists and the cause has ceased. Consequently,if cause and result were other, they would have to be simultaneous, but this con-tradicts the process of causality. The simultaneity of cause and result is alsorefuted through the examination of whether the result that is produced alreadyexists or does not exist at the time of the cause.590Thus, The Lucid Wordssays:Entities also do not arise from something other, because there is noth-ing other.591Looking at this issue from the perspective of the reasoning of the freedomfrom unity and multiplicity, if all things do not really exist and even lack an iden-tifiable nature of their own, what in them should determine one thing to be other244The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 244"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"than another one? Also, if there is no thing that is really established in itself in anyway, how could there be something other whose otherness depends on this firstnonexistent thing? As The Fundamental Versessays:If an entity in itself does not exist,An entity other [than it] does not exist either.592The refutation of things arising from something other is likewise accomplishedby analyzing the four conditions. They include all possibilities of arising fromsomething that is other than the result. The result, however, is found in none ofthe four. As The Fundamental Versessays:Conditions are fourfold:Causal, objective,Immediate, and dominant.There is no fifth condition.The nature of entitiesDoes not exist in conditions and such.593Thus, the nature of a rice sprout does not exist in any of its conditions. It doesnot exist in its causal conditions (water and manure), nor in its object condition(the harvest), nor in its immediate condition (the last moment of the rice seed),nor in its dominant condition (the person who planted the seed). Causal ConditionsIf causal conditions, such as water and manure, intrinsically have functions orproductive capacities—such as giving rise to a sprout—they would have to pro-duce sprouts all the time. And if they do not have any such functions or capaci-ties, there could never be any production from them. In this case, however, whywould they be presented as conditions for a result at all? Moreover, N›g›rjuna says,the relationship between conditions and their assumed functions cannot be settled:Function is not something that entails conditions.[Conventionally, however,] there is no function that does not entailconditions.[Thus,] what does not entail a function is not a condition,And there is none that entails a function.594Further absurd consequences can be drawn when the result and its conditionsare placed on a time line. Most people think that water, manure, and such areThe Middle from Beginning to End 245Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 245"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"the conditions of a sprout, since the latter arises in dependence on the former.However, in terms of each moment of the sprout’s arising, as long as its respec-tive moments have not arisen and thus are nonexistent, any preceding momentsof water and so on cannot be its conditions. And once the sprout’s respectivemoments have arisen, there is no more need for any conditions. Hence, whenwould they be the conditions of the sprout?This is consensus: “Since something arises in dependence on these,Therefore, they are its conditions.” As long as this [something] does not arise,How could these not be things that are not its conditions?For [both] nonexistents and existents,Conditions are not reasonable:If something does not exist, the conditions of what would they be?If something exists [already], what are conditions good for?595In general, upon analysis, any existing or nonexisting phenomenon disinte-grates and thus is not established. If no phenomenon can be established, then howcould its causes or conditions be established?Once phenomena are not establishedAs existent, nonexistent, or [both] existent and nonexistent,How could one speak of “productive causes”?It would be unreasonable, if such applied.596Object ConditionsLikewise, the object condition is not established either. In the context of percep-tion, an object is regarded as a condition for the arising of the consciousness thatperceives this object. But if they are placed on a time line, we can see that this can-not work. If the object existed before the specific consciousness that is supposedlycaused by it, what would this later consciousness perceive? The same applies ifthe object existed after the consciousness that is its perceiver. And if the objectexisted simultaneously with it, it could not be the cause of this consciousness.Immediate ConditionsIn general Buddhist epistemology, it is consensus that the previous moment ofconsciousness that has just ceased is the “immediate condition,” or the immedi-ately preceding condition of the next moment of consciousness. However, sinceit has already been refuted that there is anything that arises, something that hasceased cannot be justified. Moreover, since something that has ceased does not246The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 246"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"exist anymore, it is also not suitable to serve as a condition. Hence, an immedi-ate condition is also not established.If phenomena have not arisen,Cessation is not justified.Therefore, the immediate condition is not reasonable.If it has ceased, what would be such a condition?597Dominant ConditionsThe notion of dominant conditions is mostly used in the process of perception.It refers to the respective sense faculties based on which specific consciousnessesarise, such as the eye consciousness arising on the basis of the eye sense faculty.Since all of the above (and the following) refutations equally apply to dominantconditions, N›g›rjuna does not treat them separately.Still, Buddhists might argue, “This contradicts the Buddha’s teaching. In termsof dependent origination, he said, `Since this exists, that originates. Since this hasarisen, that arises. Due to the condition of basic unawareness, there is formationand so on.’” The Lucid Wordsstates:These teachings of arising in the sense of dependent origination andso on are not meant in terms of the nature of the object of the uncon-taminated wisdom of those who are free from the blurred vision ofbasic ignorance. “To what do they refer then?” They are meant interms of the objects of the consciousnesses of those whose eyes ofinsight are impaired by the blurred vision of basic ignorance.598Hence, a result does not dwell in any of its diverse conditions. Thus, if theresult is nonexistent at the time of its causes and conditions, how could such anonexistent arise as an existent later? If it were to arise despite its nonexistence,then it could arise even from things that are not its causes, or it could arise with-out any cause at all. As The Fundamental Versessays:The result does not exist at allIn any of its diverse conditions or their assembly.How could what does not exist in its conditionsArise from such conditions?However, if it does not existAnd were still to arise from these conditions,Why would it not also ariseFrom what are not its conditions?599The Middle from Beginning to End 247Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 247"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Some people might still argue, “Because the result depends on its conditions,the result is something that has the nature of its conditions.” If none of these con-ditions exists as something that even bears its own nature, how could any of thembe the nature of the result? On the other hand, conventionally, there is also noresult that does not depend on conditions. Therefore, causes and conditions arenothing but superimpositions.You might say, “The result is of the nature of its conditions.”[However,] conditions do not have a nature of their own.What is the result of something that is not an entity in itself?How could it be of the nature of [such] conditions?Therefore, it is not of the nature of its conditions.[However,] there is [also] no result with a nature of what are not itsconditions.Since results do not exist,How could nonconditions be conditions?6003. Establishing the reason that entities do not arise from both themselves andothers (the third part of establishing the subject property of the vajra sliver rea-soning)Some people, such as the followers of Vi ̋ ̊u and the Jainas,601say, “That a clayvase arises from itself means that it is made out of clay and still has this nature ofclay, thus not being something other than it. That the vase arises from somethingother means that it arises through the activity of a potter, a potter’s wheel, water,and so on. Hence, things do not arise exclusively from themselves nor exclusivelyfrom others. Rather they arise from a combination of these two ways of arising.”This third possibility of arising from both is already implicitly refuted throughthe above negations of things arising from themselves or from something otherrespectively. Therefore, the negation of the combination of the first two possi-bilities of arising is usually only touched upon very briefly in Centrist texts. Forexample, The Lucid Wordsexplains:Nor do entities arise from both [themselves and others], because thiswould entail [all] the flaws that were stated for both of these theses andbecause none of these [disproved possibilities] have the capacity toproduce [entities].602Thus, if neither things themselves nor something other than these things havethe power to give rise to anything, the combination of two such powerless fac-248The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 248"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"tors can in no way result in any power that causes things to arise. For example,if a single grain of sand has no power to produce olive oil, many such powerlessgrains are still equally powerless to produce oil. Or, in mathematical terms, manytimes zero is still zero.4. Establishing that entities do not arise without any cause (the fourth part ofestablishing the subject property of the vajra sliver reasoning)Most Indian hedonists or materialists claim that things arise without any causes;that is, that they just arise naturally and spontaneously come into being as theyare. One of their scriptures says:The roundness of peas, the long sharp tips of thorns,The colorful patterns of the feathers of a peacock’s wings,The rising of the sun, and the downhill flow of rivers—All these were created by nobody. Their cause is their very nature.However, this position has completely absurd consequences, such as thatthings in general would either arise all the time or never arise. Furthermore, itclearly contradicts our everyday perception of results appearing at certain timesin dependence on certain things or actions that are their causes, such as a harvestappearing only due to farming. We generally see that results do not occur just byaccident or without a cause. If things could indeed appear without any causes,anything nonexistent or impossible could manifest, such as a lotus growing in thesky. A further consequence would be that we could not perceive anything in theworld, because there would be no objects that could serve as causes for our per-ceptions. On the level of common worldly experience, if we see a blue flower, thisis due to there being a blue flower to be perceived. If there is no such blue flower,a perception of it does not arise. As The Lucid Wordssays:If these beings were empty of being causes, they could not beapprehended,Just like the smell and the color of an utpala flower in the sky.603If things arose without causes, no effort would be required to produce oraccomplish anything, since things would either arise anyway or not arise evendespite such efforts. For example, meals could appear without any ingredients orcooking, or they would not appear at all no matter how diligently we preparedthem. In fact, any goal-oriented activity, such as assembling a car, would be com-pletely pointless, since all these activities would never be the causes of a desiredresult, such as a car that could actually be driven. If we are lucky, though, it mightThe Middle from Beginning to End 249Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 249"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"pop up out of nowhere and work anyway. Thus, anything could arise at any timein a completely haphazard way, such as a blazing fire in the depths of the oceanor darkness in the middle of a bright lamp. Or, it would follow that an apple treecould arise not only from an apple seed but also from a rose seed, because—according to the position that things arise without a cause—both seeds are equalin not being the cause for the apple tree. Also, any fruits should be fully ripenedall the time or never, because their ripeness does not depend on any other factors,such as chemical processes or time. And since a peacock is not the cause of thecolors of its feathers, a crow should also have such beautiful feathers.One might object, “There is a difference in the case of a flower growing in thesky and such things as a harvest, since the former does not have an existent nature,whereas the latter have.” However, even such a difference does not remove theabove absurd consequences, since—according to the position that things arisewithout causes—a result that is assumed to have an existent nature would still besomething that arises without a cause and thus is equally subject to the sameinconsistencies.Moreover, the very fact of making any statement or even giving a reason con-tradicts the original thesis that there are no causes, since making a statement orgiving a reason is a cause that makes other persons understand something. Ifthings arise without causes, other persons should understand everything withoutanybody ever saying anything. Or, nobody would ever understand anything,despite being given the most sophisticated explanations and reasons.Other hedonists say, “The only kind of valid cognition is direct perception.Thus, only those things that can be directly perceived exist. Their causes are thefour great material elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—but not such thingsas positive or negative actions, whether they happen in this lifetime or in anypast or future ones that may be assumed. The same goes for the mind: It is merelysomething that evolves from the four elements in our body. Just as the mixtureof barley and yeast gives rise to the force that inebriates the mind, the ripeningof the union of sperm and egg gives rise to the mind.”604The first counterargument here is that the elements themselves do not exist.The three preceding possibilities for an arising of things—from themselves, some-thing other, or both—have already been refuted through the corresponding partsof the vajra sliver reasoning. Thus, all phenomena—including the four great ele-ments—do not really arise or exist in the first place. Therefore, the question ofwhether these elements can be the causes of anything does not apply.Second, even in the relative world, this position makes no sense. There are anumber of inconsistencies and counterarguments, even if the above statementson valid cognition, existence, and the body-mind problem are addressed on themere conventional level. For example, if only directly perceptible things existand can serve as causes, it would follow that our own inner organs, such as the250The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 250"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"heart, do not exist and cannot be the causes for our staying alive, since we neverdirectly perceive them (seeing them in a corpse or on an x-ray can only lead toan inference that we have these organs).In terms of past and future lives, the hedonists’ justification that these do notexist is again that if they existed, they would have to exist in a directly manifestway for our perception. However, since they are not directly perceptible, they aresaid to be nonexistent. If these people are asked whether their knowledge thatsuch lifetimes are not directly perceptible comes from direct perception or some-thing that is not direct perception, their answer naturally is, “It comes from directperception.” However, then it absurdly follows that the nonexistence of past andfuture lives as things is something directly perceptible, because they say that thelack of direct perceptibility of these lifetimes is directly perceptible. If this isaccepted, it follows that this lack of perceptibility—which is nothing but thenonexistence of things—would nevertheless be an existing thing for the hedonists,since it is directly perceptible, just as existing things are. Then it further followsthat also things do not exist, since there is no such thing as the total “lack ofthings” as a counterpart for things. In other words, “things” cannot be estab-lished without “the lack of things” and vice versa. If even this is accepted, it fol-lows that both the elements’ existence as things and the nonexistence of past andfuture lives as things are not justified, because neither things nor the lack of thingsexist.At this point, these people might object, “Well, it is very easy to know thatsomething is not directly perceptible, since this is known from the sign or reasonthat consists in its lack of direct perceptibility.” However, from their above posi-tion that direct perception is the only kind of valid cognition, it then followsthat one is not able to infer the nonexistence of past and future lives, because ifthe lack of direct perceptibility of these lifetimes is not directly perceived, one isnot able to apprehend this lack in any other way at all. If they say, “It is appre-hended through inference,” this disqualifies their standard statements about infer-ence not being a type of valid cognition, such as, “Since inferring past lives fromthe sign or reason of varying individual degrees of happiness and suffering in thislife is as unjustified as the story of the wolf’s footprints,605inference is impossi-ble” and “All that exists is limited to the spheres of the five senses.” Thus, thereis no proof that past and future lifetimes do not exist, while there are many rea-sons that suggest their existence.606As for the claim that the material elements are the causes of mind, this also can-not be justified. In general, phenomena whose characteristics are contradictorycannot function as the cause and result of each other. For example, fire does notarise from water, and permanent things do not arise from impermanent things.Likewise, on the conventional level, the main characteristics of matter are to havecertain shapes and colors, to have extensions in space and time, to obstruct otherThe Middle from Beginning to End 251Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 251"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"things, to consist of particles, and to not be conscious. On the other hand, mindhas neither shape nor color nor any spatial or durational extension. Mind doesnot obstruct anything, is not made of particles, and is conscious. Moreover, if theelements in the body were the causes of mind, any changes in these causes wouldalways have to affect the mind as their result in a strictly corresponding way. Forexample, if the body is healthy or deteriorates, the mind would have to be equallyhealthy or deteriorating. However, there are numerous counterexamples, such asa very sharp and flexible mind in a frail or handicapped body or a completelyderanged mind in a perfectly healthy body. In addition, since outer materialthings also consist of the four elements, there is no reason that stones and the likeshould not also exhibit some manifestations of consciousness as well as someother features that are found only in animate bodies, such as respiration, metab-olism, movement, and reproduction.607In brief, the appearances of this world do not arise without any causes, becausethese appearances arise only sometimes. This reason might seem odd at first. How-ever, as was explained above, if things arise without causes, all of them would haveto arise all the time or never. Thus, the fact that certain things only arise at cer-tain times and not at others is the most powerful indication that there must besomething that accounts for this difference. This “something” is the completenessof all the specific causes and conditions that lead to a certain result. Conversely,if these causes and conditions are incomplete, their specific result does not arise.To summarize the vajra sliver reasoning, it is clear that there is not the slightestarising through any of the four possibilities described. However, since it is worldlyconsensus that there is arising, such arising is just presented according to thisusual way of thinking. Thus, it is not refuted here that, from the perspective ofmere worldly consensus without analysis, it appears as if things arise. Also, thevajra sliver reasoning is definitely not meant to negate the principle of causalityaltogether. For, when not analyzed, causality clearly performs its function on thelevel of seeming reality. However, even on this level, people do not claim thatresults arise from themselves or something other and so on. Rather, they just saythat a sprout arises from a seed, but they do not determine whether the seed isidentical to or other than the sprout. As The Entrance into Centrismsays:After worldly people have merely implanted a seed,They say, “I engendered this child”And think, “I planted a tree.”Therefore, even on the worldly level, there is no arising from something other.608Thus, in general, according to Centrists, any attempt to justify everyday expe-rience through something other than just mere conventional consensus must252The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 252"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"inevitably lead to logical and—more important—spiritual problems. Thus, inits own terms, seeming reality with all its conventional appearances is not to beanalyzed, since then one already moves away from this very seeming reality. Itfunctions as such only as long as it is not questioned.From among the three doors to liberation, the vajra sliver reasoning teaches thedoor of signlessness.III. The analysis of results: the negation of an arising of existents and nonexistentsThis reasoning is basically an elaboration of the negation of arising from some-thing other as found in the context of the vajra sliver reasoning.A. The formulation of the reasoningMere appearances do not exist by their nature, because neither existents nornonexistents arise, just like an illusion.B. The three modes of the reasonHere, the subject propertyis that mere appearances do not arise either as existentsor as nonexistents. So the question is: “If a sprout arises, does it then arise assomething that existed already at the time of the seed, or does it arise as some-thing that did not exist at that time? Can it possibly arise as something that is bothexistent and nonexistent or as something that is neither?”As explained above, any phenomenon that exists will not arise, since it hasalready arisen before. Nonexistents will not arise either, because there is nothingthat could arise and because there is no cause whatsoever that could turn a non-existent into something existent. In addition, if the sprout were to arise as some-thing that already existed at the time of the seed, then it would have arisen eitherfrom something other than the seed or without any cause, but obviously notfrom this seed itself. Moreover, there would be no need for the seed as the sprout’scause, since the latter is already present without having to arise in dependence onthis seed. If the sprout has already arisen in dependence on something other thanthe seed, what would be the point of a seed as yet another cause? And if it hadarisen without any cause, the seed would be equally superfluous. On the otherhand, if the sprout arose as something that did not exist at the time of the seed,then there would not be the slightest influence or effect that the cause (the seed)could have on such a nonexistent. That the sprout could arise from the combi-nation of both possibilities—existence and nonexistence—is self-contradictory.It is also implicitly refuted through the negations of the first two possibilities,since their inconsistencies just multiply. As for the fourth possibility, there isnothing that is neither existent nor nonexistent, so what would arise?The positive entailmentof the reason here is that whatever does not arise eitherThe Middle from Beginning to End 253Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 253"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"as an existent or as a nonexistent does not exist by its nature, since these two pos-sibilities are mutually exclusive and there is no third. The same reason applies tothe negative entailment, since anything that is assumed to exist by its nature wouldnecessarily have to arise either as an existent or as a nonexistent.Exemplary proponents of the first possibility—arising as an existent—includethe Enumerators, whose position of the arising of a result that exists already at thetime of the cause has been refuted in detail above. The Buddhist school of theFollowers of The Great Exposition claims the arising of a result that already existsin the future.609This position is refuted as follows: If a thing that has not yetarisen here and now were to exist in some unknown other place at present, itmight be reasonable for it to arise here in the future. However, since there is nosuch place where all future things exist right now, what could arise from thisplace later? And even if there were such a place with already existing future things,they would have to be perceptible right now. Otherwise, how could one claimthat they exist at present? The Fundamental Versessays:If some nonarisen entityExisted somewhere,It might arise.However, since such does not exist, what would arise?610As for the second possibility—arising as a nonexistent—there are many Bud-dhists and non-Buddhists who assert the new arising of a result that previouslydid not exist. However, it is impossible for nonexistents to depend on any causes.Consequently, if something that has not existed before can still arise, it would fol-low that just about anything can arise, even impossibilities such as a hairy frog.If something that lacks arising could arise,Just about anything could arise in this way.611From among the doors to complete liberation, this reasoning teaches the doorof wishlessness.IV. The analysis of both causes and results: the negation of arising from the four possibilitiesA. The formulation of the reasoningMere appearances lack arising, because a single result does not arise from a sin-gle cause; many results do not arise from a single cause; a single result does notarise from many causes; and many results also do not arise from many causes.254The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 254"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"B. The three modes of the reasonAs for the subject property, when considered just from the perspective of our mis-takenness, the following statements are rather unproblematic: “One sprout arisesfrom one seed,” “One eye consciousness arises from three conditions,” “Manychildren are born from one mother,” and “Many harvests come from manycauses, such as seeds, water, and manure.” However, from the perspective of rea-soning, an arising from any of these four possibilities is impossible, since, brieflyput, the reasoning at hand is just an elaboration of the reasoning of the freedomfrom unity and multiplicity. As was explained above, there is no phenomenonthat is a real unity or a real multiplicity in the first place. From this, it naturallyfollows that there are no real single or multiple causes that could give rise to anysingle or multiple results.A more detailed way to look at these four possibilities is found in Jñ›nagarbha’sautocommentary on verse 14 of hisDistinction between the Two Realities:6121. A single result does not arise from a single causeFor example, if the eye sense faculty only produced the single result that is thenext moment of its own continuum, it could not also produce a visual con-sciousness in this next moment. In that case, everybody would be blind. On theother hand, if the eye sense faculty produced the single result that is a visual con-sciousness, its own continuum as an eye sense faculty would have to stop at thatmoment. Naturally, the same goes for the remaining sense faculties as well as forother phenomena, such as a candle flame: Either it produces its own nextmoment, and thus no visual perception of itself, or it causes a visual conscious-ness in someone but then becomes extinguished in that very moment.2. Many results do not arise from a single causeIf a single cause all by itself were to produce a second or more results, cause andresult would lack a causal relationship, since the cause would be single while theresult would be multiple. In other words, the singularity of the cause does notproduce a corresponding singularity of the result. However, if a further factorwithin or in addition to that single cause is assumed to produce the second result,clearly one is no longer speaking about a single cause.3. A single result does not arise from many causesThis entails the reverse of the problem in (2), that is, that the multiplicity of thecause does not produce a corresponding multiplicity of the result. Conversely, theabsence of multiplicity in the cause would not cause the absence of multiplicityin the result either. For, in this case of a single result arising from many causes,the result lacks multiplicity, while the cause does not. Consequently, neither themultiplicity of the result nor its lack thereof would have a cause, since there is noThe Middle from Beginning to End 255Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 255"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"third category beyond causes and results being either multiple or nonmultiple.Hence, nothing would have a cause. In that case, everything would either existpermanently or not exist at all or would just arise at random.4. Many results do not arise from many causesThe basic problem of the lack of invariable congruence between cause and resultin terms of both being either single or multiple applies here too. Take the exam-ple of visual perception: If the cause is multiple (for example, an eye sense fac-ulty, a visual form, and an immediately preceding moment of consciousness),then the result (the single resultant moment of a visual consciousness) shouldinvariably be multiple too, but this is obviously not the case. Likewise, in beinga result, a clay vase should be multiple due to the multiplicity of its cause (clay,water, a potter, and a potter’s wheel).As for the positive entailmenthere, it means that whatever does not arise fromthese four possibilities must necessarily lack arising altogether. The negative entail-mentmeans that anything that arises must necessarily arise from one of thesepossibilities.V. The analysis of mere appearances: the reasoning of dependent originationThe Precious Garlandsays:Due to the existence of this, that comes to be,Just as something short, when there is something long.Due to the arising of this, that arises,Just as light due to the appearance of a butter lamp.613Accordingly, there are two types of dependence: A. dependence in terms of dependent imputation, such as being short in depend-ence on being longB. dependence in terms of dependent origination, such as the arising of smokedue to the arising of fireA. Dependence in terms of imputation1. The formulation of the reasoningFor example, it may be said, “All things are neither really big nor small, becausebeing big and small depend on each other.”2. The three modes of the reason256The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 256"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"The subject propertysays that all things depend on each other in terms of beingbig or small. In other words, anything that is big in comparison to somethingsmaller than itself is at the same time small when compared to some third thingthat is even bigger and vice versa. The positive entailmentmeans that whateverdepends on something else in terms of being big or small is necessarily not reallyor independently big or small. The negative entailmentmeans that if there weresomething intrinsically big or small, it would have to be independent of every-thing other in terms of being big or small. The same applies for all other mutu-ally dependent characteristics, such as existent and nonexistent, good and bad, orbeautiful and ugly.B. Dependence in terms of origination1. The formulation of the reasoningThis reasoning is called “the king of reasonings” through which Centrists demon-strate that phenomena are empty of any true reality, since it eliminates the extremesof both permanence and extinction. Since phenomena originate in dependenceon various causes and conditions, on the conventional level of seeming reality,they are not as utterly nonexistent as a long-haired turtle.614This eliminates theextreme of extinction. At the same time, phenomena do not exist as permanentthings that are established through a nature of their own precisely because theydepend on other causes and conditions and thus lack any real and independentnature. As The SÒtra Requested by the N›g› King “The Cool One”says:The learned ones realize phenomena that originate in dependence.In no way do they rely on views about extremes.The Fundamental Versesstates:What is dependent originationIs explained as emptiness.It is a dependent designationAnd in itself the middle path.Since there is no phenomenonThat is not dependently originating,There is no phenomenonThat is not empty.615In order to explicitly eliminate the two extremes of permanence and extinction,the reasoning of dependent origination can be formulated in two main ways.The Middle from Beginning to End 257Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 257"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"a. To exclude the first extreme, the reasoning may be formulated in a negativeway: “Mere appearances do not exist by their nature, because they dependentlyoriginate, just like a dream.”b. To eliminate the extreme of extinction and to account for seeming reality, thereasoning may also be stated in an affirmative way: “All phenomena are not non-existent like the horns of a rabbit, because they dependently originate.” Anotherway to say this would be: “Phenomena are illusionlike, because they dependentlyoriginate.”2. The three modes of the reasonAt first, the reason “dependently originating” may look like an affirming reason.The subject propertysays that all phenomena necessarily originate in depend-ence. In terms of its phrasing, this appears to be an affirmative statement. Thepositive entailmentis that whatever originates in dependence necessarily doesnot exist by its nature, is illusionlike, and is also not utterly nonexistent. The neg-ative entailmentmeans that if there were anything that existed by its nature, wasnot illusion like, or was utterly nonexistent, it would necessarily not originate independence. In particular, the explicit words of the reasonings under (B) seemto affirm something about phenomena, that is, their “existence” or “illusionlikebeing.” However, the meaning that is pointed out by the reason “dependentlyoriginating” is nothing other than that things are empty of real existence or realarising. Thus, in whatever way this reasoning of dependent origination may beformulated, it never becomes a means to ascertain some really existent things,be they seeming or ultimate, nor does it suggest some really existent kind ofdependent origination. Since this is clearly a case of relying not on mere wordsbut on the meaning, the reasoning of dependent origination is a negating rea-soning in effect, since “arising from dependently originating conditions” meansnothing other than “lack of real arising.” Obviously, the word “arising” is usedhere in two different ways: In the first phrase, it refers to the mere illusionlikedisplay of causes and conditions due to ignorance, from which we gain thewrong impression that things really arise. The second phrase means the denialof any real arising in this illusory display, without denying its mere appearance.As the sÒtras say:What arises from conditions does not arise.It does not have the nature of arising.What depends on conditions is explained to be empty.Those who understand emptiness are heedful.Candrakırti’s Commentary on The Four Hundred Versessays:258The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 258"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"I do not say that entities do not exist, because I say that they originatein dependence. “So are you a realist then?” I am not, because I am justa proponent of dependent origination. “What sort of nature is it thenthat you [propound]?” I propound dependent origination. “What isthe meaning of dependent origination?” It has the meaning of the lackof a nature and the meaning of nonarising through a nature [of itsown]. It has the meaning of the origination of results with a naturesimilar to that of illusions, mirages, reflections, cities of scent-eaters,616magical creations, and dreams. It has the meaning of emptiness andidentitylessness.617Thus, this reasoning shows that, just like the two sides of a single coin, depend-ent origination and emptiness—or appearance and emptiness—are not at all con-tradictory but an inseparable unity. This means that although dependentlyoriginating phenomena lack any ultimately real existence, on the conventionallevel they are not just completely nonexistent, since—unlike sky-flowers andsuch—they represent the experiential consensus of our everyday lives. TheEntrance into Centrismsays: Just like a vase and such do not exist in true realityAnd at the same time exist as common worldly consensus,All entities originate in this very same way.Hence, it does not follow that they are the same as the son of a barren woman.Since both these [causes and results] are illusionlike,We are not at fault and the entities of the world do exist [as such].618The Fundamental Versesdeclares:Whatever might be used to invalidate emptiness,That is, dependent origination,Just serves to invalidateThe entirety of worldly conventions.619If things were not empty of independent and real existence, the interdepend-ent origination of causes and results in the world would be impossible, sincenothing could be affected by anything. Thus, none of the appearances and con-ventions that we constantly deal with would ever come about. However, again,this seeming dependent origination is not something that is presented as part ofa Centrist system of its own. All that Centrists say is that, just from the perspec-The Middle from Beginning to End 259Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 259"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"tive of ordinary worldly experiences, certain appearances seem to appear independence on the appearance of certain others, which are called their conditions.Moreover, the presentation of seeming phenomena as dependent originationserves as a proper support to conveniently approach their ultimate reality, whichis that causes and results are empty of any nature. All dualistic phenomena (suchas cause and result, subject and object, cyclic existence and nirv› ̊a, or seemingand ultimate reality) are just set up in mutual dependence, but none of themexists independently through a nature of its own. In this way, the Centrist viewis free from the two extremes of permanence and extinction.The gist of this is as follows: When Centrists present the arising and ceasingof dependently originating causes and results on the level of no analysis, theyneither superimpose nor deprecate anything with regard to the seeming worldlyreality of mere appearances. Therefore, when Centrists engage in the conven-tional interactions of adopting certain things and rejecting others, they do notdeviate from the ways of seeming reality, since they express things in a way thatdoes not add or remove anything from how people deal with these things in thecontext of common worldly consensus. While it definitely makes sense to main-tain this approach on the level of no analysis, if Centrists were to assert arisingand ceasing in terms of dependent origination on the level of analysis, such wouldonly amount to superimposition and deprecation with regard to both realities.Therefore, if Centrists were to approach the ultimate in this way, they woulddeviate from both realities. From the perspective of analysis, there would be thesuperimposition of establishing the dependently originating phenomena of seem-ing reality in some sense, while in fact they are not established. To imagine thatthese phenomena are somehow established would negate the ultimate freedomfrom arising and ceasing and thus deprecate ultimate reality.In a broader sense, the reasoning of mere dependent origination is said to be theking of Centrist reasonings, since it not only dispels the extremes of permanenceand extinction but also eradicates all kinds of wrong views. For example, it refutesthat things arise without any cause, since this would mean that things do notdepend on anything at all, while dependent origination shows the opposite: thatthings depend on collections of their specific causes and conditions. This reason-ing also negates all notions of a permanent, single, and nonconcordant cause, suchas a primal substance or a creator god. For, if things arose from a single cause, thiswould contradict our experience that they in fact depend on vast numbers of con-ditions. Nor can things depend on a permanent cause, since something permanentis by definition devoid of performing any function or activity, because such alreadyentails a process of change. If things could arise from nonconcordant causes, itwould be unreasonable that they have to depend on their own specific causes.Likewise, the reasoning of dependent origination equally refutes that thingsarise from themselves, from something other, or from both. In terms of arising260The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 260"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"from itself, a thing can neither depend on itself nor act upon itself. Furthermore,if a thing is not established in itself, it can be neither something that depends onsomething else nor something on which something else depends. On the otherhand, if a thing were established in itself, it would not have to depend on anything.As for arising from something other, if things are not established in them-selves in the first place, the question of what depends on what as well as the wholenotion of “other” is pointless. Even if is assumed that things are established inthemselves, this would mean that they do not have to depend on anything other.However, being established by themselves yet still having to depend on somethingelse (such as causes and conditions) is self-contradictory. As for arising from boththemselves and something other, obviously, all these flaws would just multiply.The Entrance into Centrismsummarizes:Since entities originate in dependence,All these thoughts cannot withstand examination.Therefore, this reasoning of dependent originationCuts through the entire web of erroneous views.620ConclusionEach of the five great Centrist reasonings is in itself fully sufficient to produce anunderstanding that things lack any real or independent existence. However, aswas shown for the vajra sliver reasoning and the reasoning of the freedom fromunity and multiplicity, they supplement each other in generating incontrovert-ible certainty and an all-encompassing realization of this lack of real existence.Moreover, in order to approach such a realization, the various reasonings providea range of different avenues that may be more or less convenient or convincingfor individual people with varying capacities, propensities, or particular miscon-ceptions.In this context of the five great Centrist reasonings, it should be clear that a realand intrinsic nature of things is impossible among knowable objects. Therefore,strictly speaking, from among the three modes of a correct reason, the negativeentailment cannot be established here. As was explained, the negative entailmentmeans that the reason may never apply to the heterologous set. In terms of theabove five reasonings, the general meaning of the predicate in all of them is “whatlacks a real nature.” Thus, “what has a real nature” would be the heterologous set.Since it is precisely such a real nature of things that does not exist, it does notmake sense to say that the respective reason—such as “being free from unity andmultiplicity” or “originating in dependence”—may not apply to a heterologousset (that is, something that has a real nature) that is nonexistent. In other words,the question as to whether something can apply to, entail, or include a nonex-istent or not is per se irrelevant.The Middle from Beginning to End 261Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 261"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"However, that the third mode cannot be established in no way invalidates theabove reasonings. As was explained, there is no doubt that if there were such athing as a really existing cup, it would necessarily have to be established either asa cup that is a unity or as a cup that is a multiplicity. The same goes for hypo-thetical, really arising entities. Furthermore, there are many concordant examplesfor the nonexistence of a real nature—such as illusions, reflections, and dreams—that can be appropriately employed in these reasonings. Finally, what is to becomprehended through the inferential cognitions that are based on such argu-ments is nothing but the probandum of these arguments—that all things lack areal nature—and never its opposite.As was explained, there are two types of negating reasons: those that are basedon the nonobservation of something connected and those that are based on theobservation of something contradictory. The first four Centrist reasonings fallunder the first category, and the reason of dependent origination falls under thelatter.In general, there is no disagreement between Autonomists and Consequen-tialists about either these conventional issues or the essential point of how theyunderstand ultimate reality. Thus, the five great reasonings of Centrism are com-mon to Autonomists and Consequentialists. Both use these arguments to pointout phenomenal identitylessness. Their difference is that Consequentialists saythat these five reasonings merely follow the conventions of logic as acknowledgedby others. On the mere conventional level, Autonomists understand them asautonomous arguments that are acknowledged by both parties.Other ReasoningsApart from the five great Centrist reasonings, there are two further major argu-ments that are used to determine phenomenal identitylessness.In the first reasoning, any real existence of the mind as the apprehender isnegated through the preceding negation of something apprehended. Thus,through using an appropriate reasoning of one’s choice, one starts by refuting thenotion of really and independently existent objects. Once no such objects are tobe found, there can be no real subject—the apprehending mind—that cognizesthem, since the subject has to depend on the existence of its object. If neither sub-ject nor object really exists, all phenomena do not really exist, since phenomenaare either subjects or objects. As The Entrance into Centrismsays:In brief, understand this meaning:Just as knowable objects do not exist, mind does not exist either.The Buddhas said, “If there are no knowable objects,One easily finds that a knower is excluded.”262The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 262"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"If knowable objects do not exist, the negation of a knower is established.Therefore, they first negated knowable objects.621The second reasoning inductively applies the realization of the emptiness ofone phenomenon to all phenomena. This is described in firyadeva’s Four Hun-dred Verses:That which is the observer of one single entityIs explained to be the observer of everything.That which is the emptiness of one [entity]Is the emptiness of everything.622Here, “the observer” refers to the supreme knowledge that realizes emptiness. Allthings, such as form, appear in different ways, but they are not different in thatthey do not arise through a real nature of their own. Therefore, if it is understoodthat one phenomenon does not arise through a nature of its own, then it is alsorealized that all other phenomena equally do not arise through a nature of theirown. This is like every drop of the ocean having the same taste. The experienceof the taste of a single drop of ocean water is the same experience as the taste ofevery drop of the ocean. Likewise, when a single conditioned phenomenon isrealized to be empty, the emptiness of all conditioned phenomena is realized,since all phenomena share this basic feature of being conditioned. As The SÒtraRequested by Sky Treasuresays:Those who meditate on a single phenomenon and thus understandThat all phenomena are like an illusion and a mirage,Ungraspable, hollow, false, and not solid,Will soon proceed to the heart of enlightenment.The SÒtra of the King of Meditative Concentrationagrees:Through one, you will know all.Through one, you will see all.It is said that, strictly speaking, the latter reasoning is only suitable for peoplewhose minds are not affected by any Buddhist or non-Buddhist philosophical sys-tems, so that they, from their unquestioning worldly perspective, can directlyenter the middle path beyond extremes. Thus, this reasoning is not intended forthose who already follow certain philosophical systems. Such people may havedetermined through their systems that such things as coarse outer objects lack realand independent existence, but it is precisely their adherence to these philo-The Middle from Beginning to End 263Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 263"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"sophical systems that prevents them from extending their analysis and realizationto other, more subtle things that nevertheless bear this same nature of lacking realexistence.Unmasking Personal IdentityIn general, all the reasonings that negate phenomenal identity can also be usedto negate personal identity and vice versa, since the latter is just a special instanceof the former. However, the clinging to a personal identity of our own is singledout to be tackled through additional specific reasonings, since it governs all lev-els of our thinking and behavior in a very immediate way and is thus directlyresponsible for the arising of mental afflictions and the ensuing suffering. More-over, the realization of personal identitylessness that is achieved through these rea-sonings is the cause for liberation from cyclic existence.The conceptions of clinging to a personal self focus on the five aggregates thatconstitute our psychophysical continua. Even if these aggregates themselves arenot taken to be our self, any self that is assumed to be something other than theaggregates is always regarded as being related to these aggregates—that is, ourimmediate personal appearances and experiences—in one way or the other. Wethink in this way by regarding certain aspects of these aggregates either as beingour self or as being connected to or controlled by such a self. Therefore, ourgrasping at a self constantly engages one or several of the five aggregates. In cer-tain situations, we extend our thoughts of a self even to our friends, relatives,and possessions: If someone else benefits or harms them, we think that this per-son has helped or harmed us.Technically speaking, this conceptual object of a “self” that is apprehendedthrough the clinging to the aggregates as being or relating to a self is considereda nonentity;623more specifically, it is a term generality624that does not correspondto any real object. Obviously, from the perspective of reasonings that analyze forthe ultimate, there is no need to talk about the existence of a real personal iden-tity. However, even from the perspective of reasonings that analyze conventionalexpressions, a real personal identity does not exist.625Still, in adaptation to the per-spective of worldly consensus without examination and analysis, the Buddhanever denied the mere notions of a person or an individual. However, thesenotions never correspond to any actual object that exists in a substantial way.They are always understood to exist in a purely nominal way in the context of themere correct seeming. As the sÒtras say:Just as a collection of [certain] partsIs described by the name “chariot,”Likewise, in dependence on the aggregates,One speaks about “sentient beings” on the seeming level.264The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 264"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"The negations of the object of our clinging to a self are usually presented in theframework of the twenty views about a real personality that were explained ear-lier.626In brief, the sÒtras describe these twenty views as follows:• (1–5) the five notions that one of the five aggregates is the self• (6–10) the five notions that the self possesses one of the aggregates as a com-panion or retinue• (11–15) the five notions that one of the aggregates dwells in or is based on theself in such a way that it is supported by the self• (16–20) the five notions that the self dwells in or is based on one of the aggre-gates in such a way that this aggregate is its supportThat none of these notions applies is expressed in N›g›rjuna’s Letter to a Friend:It is said that form is not the self,That the self does not possess form, that the self does not dwell on form,And that form does not dwell on the self.Please realize that the remaining four aggregates are empty in the sameway.627Accordingly, none of the five aggregates is the self, the self does not possess anyof the aggregates, nor do they support each other; that is, neither do the aggre-gates support the self, nor does the self support the aggregates. Thus, refutingthese twenty views excludes that there is a self that exists in any relation to the fiveaggregates. KamalaŸıla’s second volume of hisStages of Meditationsummarizes thenegation of such a real person or self:[First,] the person is not observed outside of the aggregates, con-stituents, and sources. The person is also not the nature of the aggre-gates and such, because the aggregates and such have the nature ofbeing impermanent and multiple and because the person is that whichis imputed by others as a permanent and singular entity. A person thatis not suitable to be expressed as either the same as or as somethingother [than the aggregates] is not suitable as an existent entity, becausethere are no other possibilities of how entities exist.628Thus, the starting point of analyzing whether this self as the hypothetical refer-ent of our clinging to “I” and “me” really exists is the basic question of whethersuch a self is the same as or different from the aggregates.The self is not the same as the aggregates, because their respective characteris-tics do not match. The aggregates are (1) impermanent, (2) a formation of mul-The Middle from Beginning to End 265Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 265"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"tiple factors, and (3) dependent on others, whereas the self is generally appre-hended as something lasting, singular, and independent. In detail, this is as fol-lows:1) It is established through reasoning that the aggregates are brought aboutthrough causes and conditions and are impermanent from moment to moment.On the other hand, it is established through our own experience that we appre-hend our self as something lasting, such as when we fancy that we recognize thesame self in us that we saw yesterday.2) The aggregates are clearly a multiplicity; that is, they consist of forms, feelings,and so on, each one in turn having many subdivisions. On the other hand, ourexperience tells us that we apprehend our self as something singular, such as whenwe think, “I am an individual, a single person.”3) Analysis shows us that each one of the aggregates is something that arises andceases in dependence on various causes and conditions. On the other hand, expe-rientially, we apprehend our self as something intrinsic and independent, such aswhen we focus inwardly and think, “This is me” or “It is only me who decideswhat I do.”If we then look for a self that is different from our aggregates, we do not findanything either. The reasons for this are as follows:1) Experientially, our clinging to “I” and “me” does not engage in or relate to any-thing other than just our aggregates.2) If there were a self other than our body and mind, it would have to appear tous, because it is impossible for our own self to be a phenomenon that is hiddenfrom ourselves.3) Something that is free from the characteristics of the aggregates therebybecomes a nonentity, since the aggregates contain only entities, that is, phe-nomena that perform a function. However, if something is a nonentity, this con-tradicts its being able to perform a function, such as that the self thinks or is incontrol of “its” body and mind.As The Fundamental Versessays:If the aggregates were the self,It would possess arising and ceasing.If it were something other than the aggregates,It would not possess the characteristics of the aggregates.629Furthermore, things in their entirety are contained in just these five aggregates266The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 266"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"of form, feeling, discrimination, formation, and consciousness. A self that wouldbe altogether different from these is not observable through any kind of per-ceptual valid cognition even for a short while. Let alone yogic valid perception,all that the five sense consciousnesses perceive are outer objects such as visibleform,630while self-awareness by definition is only aware of consciousness itself.Therefore, none of these cognitions can have a self as its object. Furthermore,since neither a nature nor a result of a self that is not contained in the aggregatesis observable, there is also no reason that produces a correct inference aboutsuch a self. Thus, it cannot be established through inferential valid cognitioneither.At this point, one might just say, “This very mental state that thinks, `This isme’ is the subject that validly cognizes the self.” However, since this mental stateis nothing but a thought whose essential character is clinging, it is not a percep-tual valid cognition. Nor is it an inferential valid cognition, because it is a mereassumption that does not rely on any correct arguments. Rather, this thought orimpulse is nothing but mere unfounded imagination that emerges under theinfluence of our beginningless habituation to entertain it. As for the operationalmode of this thought, it exactly corresponds to mistaking a rope for a snake.Mistaking the aggregates for a self is just a much more deeply ingrained andsolidified habitual mental tendency.Some people even say that the self exists but that it cannot be determined tobe either identical to or different from the aggregates. They also say that it is nei-ther permanent nor impermanent, nor any third possibility.631However, such aphenomenon does not exist, since there is nothing that can be observed throughany valid cognition as existing either within or outside of the aggregates. Also, itis impossible to observe any existent that is neither permanent nor impermanentnor any third possibility. To postulate such a “self” is nothing but a convolutedway of saying that it simply does not exist at all.If a self that is established through its own nature is refuted through such ananalysis, then what is “mine” is implicitly negated too. This is like the exampleof the daughter of a barren woman. Since she is not observable in the first place,nothing that would be hers—such as her body or her dress—is observable either.As The Fundamental Versessays:If there is no self,Where should there be what is mine?632The main formal way in which Centrism negates a personal self is the seven-fold reasoning through the analogy of a chariot. The analogy of a chariot was taughtby the Buddha.633Later, N›g›rjuna and his spiritual heirs put it into a systematicformat. The Entrance into Centrismreads:The Middle from Beginning to End 267Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 267"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"It is not asserted that a chariot is something other than its parts.It is not something that is not other, nor does it possess them.It does not exist in the parts, nor do the parts exist in it.It is neither their mere collection nor the shape—thus is the analogy.634The first five points of this analysis were already presented by N›g›rjuna. Inaddition, Candrakırti taught the analysis of the collection of the parts and of theshape of the chariot. When one searches for a really existing chariot throughthese seven points of examination, it neither exists as its parts (such as the wheels)nor as something other than these parts. The collection of the parts and the shapeof the chariot are refuted in passing, since one does not find either the collectionor the shape as anything other than or above the parts that make up their col-lection and the particular shape of a chariot. If these seven points are applied inan analogous way to the analysis of a personal self, this self is not found as some-thing other than the aggregates nor as the aggregates themselves. In fact, these twopossibilities implicitly cover all seven parts of the analysis, the remaining fivebeing merely their elaborations. For if the self is neither the same as nor differ-ent from the aggregates, there is no self at all. Consequently, there is no self topossess or control the aggregates. There is likewise no self that exists in the aggre-gates, nor can the latter exist in a nonexistent self.6351) The formulation of the reasoningA personal self does not exist, because it is neither the same as the aggregates norsomething other; because it does not possess them; because the self does not existin the aggregates nor do these aggregates exist in the self; and because it is nei-ther their mere collection nor their shape.2) The three modes of the reasonThe subject propertymeans that a hypothetical self does not conform to any of theseven possibilities just mentioned, such as being the same as the aggregates. Thereis also no other possibility for the existence of such a self. In detail:a) The self is not something other than the aggregates. As explained above, ourexperiences and our clinging in relation to a self do not refer to anything outsideof the five aggregates or outside of our body and mind. Otherwise, our self wouldbe totally unrelated to our body and mind and at best some nonentity unable toperform any function at all.b) If the self were the same as the aggregates, there are several possibilities as tohow this could be the case. If the self were the same as all the aggregates together,we would have at least five different selves, since there are five aggregates, not to268The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 268"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"mention their subdivisions. Moreover, since the aggregates momentarily ariseand cease, the self would do so too. Thus, we would have a new and different selfin every moment. In addition, this would make any memory of actions or expe-riences impossible, since the self that does or experiences something in a certainmoment ceases in the next moment. The new self would have no connection tothe old one.If the self is held to be just one of these aggregates or a certain part of it, whichone would it be? As for the aggregate of form, we do not consider outer materialthings to be our personal self. Experientially, it is also obvious that we do not takejust our body to be our self. Moreover, what would then be the differencebetween me and my corpse? And when we look at all the changes in terms of size,weight, shape, and so on that our body has undergone since we were born, thisclearly does not correspond to our sense of a lasting “me.” On the other hand, ifwe think that our mind is our self, we still have four mental aggregates to choosefrom. In addition, each one of them is itself a collection of many different fac-tors, such as the whole range of all our constantly changing feelings, perceptions,and thoughts. As explained above, nothing in this unceasing and manifold fluxcorresponds to the features of a lasting, single, and independent self. Certainly,nobody would identify just a single, fleeting emotion, perception, or thought asone’s personal self. Also, our minds change tremendously over the span of a life-time. As babies, we did not even know how to eat and drink properly, and nowwe might construct spaceships or even read books on Madhyamaka . . . So howdoes this correspond to our seeming experience of a lasting self? Moreover, suchdrastic changes of body and mind are not seen merely over the period of a wholelife but can happen any moment. For example, consider how “we” feel—or howwe experience our self—when we are depressed, lonely, unsuccessful, poor, or illin contrast to being happy, loved, successful, rich, and healthy.If the mere continuum of the aggregates is considered to be the self, then theabove flaws in terms of it being momentarily impermanent equally apply here,since it is the very nature of a continuum to change moment by moment. Anycontinuum is not established in itself, since it is just a label that is applied to aseries of different moments, such as calling a stream of many drops of water thatfollow one after the other and are continuously exchanged a “river.” If we thinkthat the self is that which holds the moments of our psychophysical continuatogether, there is nothing that could perform such a function. There is no forceor energy that fastens these moments together or underlies them, since all thereare in a continuum are these single moments. A hypothetical such force is alsonot necessary, since any subsequent moment in a continuum arises only independence on its previous moment. Since the previous moment has alreadyceased when the following one arises, they can never be simultaneous. Thus, howcould they be joined in any way by anything?The Middle from Beginning to End 269Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 269"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"c) The self cannot possess the aggregates, because it has already been refuted thatit is the same as or different from the aggregates. So what else could there be topossess them? Moreover, even if the self were all or just one of the aggregates,which would possess which? All aggregates together cannot possess themselves.Nor can the body possess the mind or vice versa, for how should something withform possess something without form or be possessed by it? Also, the mentalaggregates cannot possess each other, for they are all formless. In addition, sinceall aggregates are momentary, which moment exactly could possess which othermoments? There is certainly no question of possessing any past or futuremoments. And as for present moments, how could any one of them influence,control, or possess any other, since not even the smallest indivisible moment canbe found?d) The self neither exists in nor is supported by the aggregates. Otherwise, itwould again just be a part of these aggregates or the aggregates would supportthemselves. Then the same inconsistencies as under (c) would apply. And if theself were something different from the aggregates—a nonentity—how could itexist among them or be supported by them? A nonentity cannot be supported byentities, since there is no possible connection or contact between such mutuallyexclusive phenomena as entities and nonentities. Moreover, nonentities indicatethe absence of entities, so how could an absence, such as the lack of a table, besupported by anything?e) The aggregates do not exist in the self. If the self were one or all of the aggre-gates, then the aggregates would have to exist in all or in one of themselves. Andif the self were different from the aggregates—if the self were not an entity—howcould entities (the aggregates) exist within the absence of entities? Even if theaggregates existed within a self that is the absence of entities (such as space), therecould not be the slightest relation or interaction between the aggregates and sucha self. The aggregates are also not supported by the self, since the same conse-quences as under (3) would follow. For if the self were the same as the aggregates,they would have to support themselves; and if it were different, a nonentity wouldhave to support entities.f) The self is not the mere collection of the aggregates, since it would then stillexist even if one’s five aggregates were complete but disassembled, for example,when various parts of one’s body are cut off and piled up around it. Moreover,if one or several parts of one’s aggregates are missing, such as a finger or certainfeatures of one’s personality due to Alzheimer’s disease, the self would be defec-tive too. In addition, if we just refer to the mere collection of the aggregates asthe self and thus give up the notion of a self as something that controls or owns270The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 270"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"these aggregates, whose aggregates would they then be? Their mere collectiondoes not control or own itself.g) The self is also not the shape of all the aggregates, since the four mental aggre-gates do not have any shape and since, experientially, we do not consider the selfto be just the shape of our body. Moreover, if this very shape were the self, whoseshape would it then be? Also, the shape of each body part cannot be the self, sinceit then would follow that we have as many selves as we have body parts. In addi-tion, the shapes of the body parts do not change whether the body is a whole or itsparts are separated. Thus, if the shapes of the individual parts were the self, it wouldnot make any difference for the self if the body parts were severed from the body.As for the positive entailmentof the sevenfold reasoning using the analogy of achariot, whether we refer to a self or anything else, if something does not exist asany of the above seven possibilities, it cannot exist at all. The negative entailmentmeans that if it existed, it would necessarily have to exist as one of these possi-bilities.636To summarize, from the perspective of mistakenness and without analysis, theself seems to exist just like persons, sentient beings, and so on seem to exist. How-ever, when analyzed, just as a self does not exist, also persons and such do notexist. Likewise, just as cars, tables, forests, and so on exist on the mere conven-tional level, also the self may be said to exist on this level. Under analysis, just asthe self does not exist, all phenomena should be understood to be free from allreference points, such as existence and nonexistence.The Result of Centrist Reasoned AnalysisRight from the beginning, dependently originating phenomena, persons, and soon are not really established, but non-Buddhists and Buddhist realists still fall intothe various extremes of superimposing or denying such phenomena and persons.Therefore, Centrist reasonings serve to put an end to these reifications, be theyin terms of existence or nonexistence. Accordingly, everybody in the tradition ofN›g›rjuna and his spiritual heirs insists that, in Centrism, it is impossible toattain any realization that bears even the faintest resemblance to entertaining anyreference points. The only possible result of properly employed Centrist reason-ing is to pass into the peace of nonarising that is free from all reference points.Thus, when phenomena are analyzed with Centrist reasonings, all conceptions ofsuperimposition and denial—such as clinging to identity, identitylessness, exis-tence, nonexistence, arising, ceasing, causes, the lack of causes, and so on—grad-ually come to an end. This is precisely the purpose of the Centrist approach toreasoning. As The Entrance into Centrismsays:The Middle from Beginning to End 271Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 271"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Ordinary beings are bound by conceptions.Nonconceptual yogins will find release.Hence, the learned state that the result of analysisIs that conceptions are at peace.The analyses in [N›g›rjuna’s] treatise were not performed out ofattachment to debate.[Rather,] he taught true reality for the sake of complete release.andAttachment to one’s own view and quarreling about others’ viewsAre in themselves nothing but [expressions of reifying] thinking.Therefore, setting aside attachment and anger,Analysis will swiftly lead to release.637⁄›ntideva agrees:Once neither entities nor nonentitiesRemain before the mind,There is no other mental flux [either].Therefore, it is utter nonreferential peace.638By relying on extensive Centrist scriptures and reasonings, one starts out withnegating all views on existence and nonexistence. Through the discriminatingknowledge that arises in this process, one arrives at a conceptual understandingthat all phenomena lack an intrinsic nature of their own. Then, based on themeditation of calm abiding in which one rests one-pointedly in this actuality, theincreasingly pure meditation of superior insight into the true nature of phe-nomena is developed. In this way, the accumulations are completed and the mindis purified of both afflictive and cognitive obscurations, which finally leads toattaining the state of perfect Buddhahood. This is why it is said that the supremecause for attaining liberation and omniscience is the supreme knowledge throughstudy, reflection, and meditation that clearly realizes—in a way in which there isnothing to be realized—that all phenomena are without nature. In other words,the success of the relentless Centrist raid on all objects of reification, includingreification and the reifier, is measured by diminishing the clinging to the variouslayers of fixed ideas that obscure mind’s clarity of seeing the nature of things asit is.272The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 272"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Madhyamaka MeditationThe following exposition is mainly based on KamalaŸıla’s three-volume Stages ofMeditation(the only Indian Centrist text that explains meditation in detail) andon the oral instructions that are transmitted within the Karma Kagyü tradition.As I try to approach Centrist meditation from a number of different angles, somephrases may appear more or less repetitive. However, since this topic is hardly evertreated in great detail, and since meditation is all about repeated familiarization,there seems to be no harm in hearing a few things more than once.Why Is Analytical Meditation Necessary?As was explained in detail, the main cause for all our samsaric problems is basicignorance that expresses itself as our instinctive clinging to a personal self andreally existing phenomena. The only means for eliminating this fundamentalunawareness is to develop its opposite: an awareness through which we see ourmind and phenomena as they really are. In technical terms, this is called dis-criminating knowledge, which is the seed for the omniscient wisdom of a Bud-dha. As a sÒtra says:If you discriminate that phenomena are identitylessAnd meditate by discriminating them in this way,This is the cause for the result of attaining nirv› ̊a.Peace will not come about through any other cause.In general, Buddhism provides a large variety of skillful means to generateinsight into the true nature of mind and phenomena, but analytical meditationis the way in which this insight is developed and enhanced in a very systematicand thorough way. This is the first reason analytical meditation is necessary. Second, when we consider that afflictions and suffering are the negative reper-cussions of our ignorance and clinging, this may strengthen our wish to tacklethem. These repercussions do not only manifest on the private or personal level;but especially in the present time of globalization, it is easy to see how devastat-ing such clinging by even a single person can be for the whole world. For exam-ple, take the “innocent” notion of who we are. Ask someone in New York, “Whoare you?” and the answer might be, “I am Helen, and I am an American.” So far,so good, but the story does not end there. Rather, this notion of being an Amer-ican involves the feeling of belonging to a certain nation and homeland: “All theland between the East Coast and the West Coast is my country, and all the peo-ple who live there are my compatriots.” In this way, the sense of “me” and “mine”is extended over large parts of a continent, and the ego reaches out to the bordersThe Middle from Beginning to End 273Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 273"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"of the United States, so to speak. It may not even stop there, since patriots lovetheir country and want to protect it. Consequently, they may perceive certainlegitimate interests and security concerns across the entire planet. Of course, peo-ple in other nations, such as Iraq or Afghanistan, have the same tendencies. Basedon this, all nations consider other nations that have the same interests or visionto be their friends, and certain others their enemies. In this way, it is clear thatall the attachment and hatred that develop in this process and the many conflictsin the world that result from it are basically rooted in “ego clashes.”Of course, in the midst of such conflicts, be they interpersonal or interna-tional, we usually have no idea where things started, and sometimes that evendoesn’t matter to us anymore. So in this context, we could see analytical medi-tation as taking a break from our usual behavior patterns and asking ourselves,“Wait a minute, what are we doing here?” Through Centrist analysis, we try totake a closer look at our unquestioned experiences and actions, such as having aself and trying to defend it and its territory. In other words, we take time to sitdown and run a thorough check on whether our highly subjective and habitualreactions really make any sense. Do they stand up to the facts and needs withina wider perspective, or is it possible for us to have a much better and more ben-eficial time with ourselves and one another?Third, as for removing the root cause for cyclic existence, it is said in all Bud-dhist schools that just resting the mind in a one-pointed state of calm abidingdoes not lead to liberation from cyclic existence, let alone Buddhahood. The mainreason for this is that whatever meditation we may practice, if it does not work tosever the root of cyclic existence, it will at best calm down our manifest sufferingand afflictions. However, it will not eradicate the latent tendencies or mental seedsthat make suffering and afflictions arise again when we meet the right conditionsat some later point. Most layers of reifying ourselves and other phenomena thatprovide the fertile ground for such seeds operate at the level of instinct and uncon-scious impulses. Hence, they can only be brought into awareness and then under-mined as we scrutinize our ingrained worldviews and expose them to the light ofprajñ› through the meditation of superior insight or analytical meditation.Fourth, in order to properly understand and employ his teachings, the Bud-dha said, we have to work with the four reliances:1) Do not rely on persons but on the dharma.2) As for this dharma, do not rely on the words but on the meaning.3) As for the meaning, do not rely on the expedient meaning but on the defini-tive meaning.4) And as for the definitive meaning, do not rely on ordinary consciousness buton wisdom.274The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 274"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Analytical meditation is the main way to make these distinctions properly, toinvestigate and cultivate the actual meaning of the dharma, and to provide theground for the nondual wisdom that directly sees how things are.Fifth, merely studying and reflecting on all of this is not sufficient. Even if weunderstand the two types of identitylessness and the emptiness of all phenomena,that alone does not prevent us from continuing to behave as if we had a self andas if things were solidly real. There is definitely a difference between under-standing a wall to be empty and being able to walk through this wall. From timewithout beginning, we have grown thoroughly accustomed to and solidified ourbelief in a self and really existing phenomena. In fact, this is our most deeplyrooted conviction. Since it is so entrenched in us, we cannot expect that a littlebit of understanding of emptiness will have the power to overthrow this firmbelief immediately. Rather, the only way to replace this mistaken notion is bygradually and thoroughly deconstructing it and cultivating its opposite: the real-ization of emptiness. Usually, upon first hearing about emptiness and the lack ofa self, most of us will say, “No way is this true!” It is only upon a thorough andrepeated investigation of the notion of a personal self that we might think, “Okay,I can see that there is no self in my five aggregates, but I do not believe thateverything is just empty.” For example, who would believe right away that theirown bodies, friends, houses, and cars are empty? Thus, we proceed further withour analysis by looking at phenomenal identitylessness. When doing this, wemay initially develop doubt that everything is as solidly real as we think it is.Continuing the analysis, we may arrive at the thought “Probably all this isempty.” The end of our analysis is reached when we have developed unshakablecertainty that all phenomena are empty.At present, we are extremely well trained in seeing phenomena as nonempty.When engaging in Centrist analysis, we have to retrain in seeing phenomena asemptiness. In other words, over time, we have managed to be completely andeffortlessly accustomed to imagining the real existence of a self and phenomena.In Centrist meditation, the point is to grow equally accustomed to the lack of aself and real phenomena, which is possible only through repeated familiarizationin meditation. As noted earlier, the Sanskrit term for “meditation” (bh›van›) lit-erally means “to perfume.” Thus, meditation is understood as perfuming ourmind with emptiness until the scent of emptiness becomes inseparable from themind’s fabric. In the first volume of his Stages of Meditation, KamalaŸıla says:Thus, through the knowledge [that comes] from reflection, one dis-criminates true actuality. In order to reveal it, one develops the knowl-edge [that results] from meditation. The Jewel Cloud SÒtra639and othersteach that this actuality will not be revealed merely through studyingand such. It becomes [revealed through] practitioners who make [theirThe Middle from Beginning to End 275Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 275"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"own] experiences. Without the very clear brilliance of knowledgedawning, the darkness that veils the truth is not dispelled. Practicingmeditation many times, knowledge will dawn. . . . In The SÒtra of theKing of Meditative Concentration, the Blessed One declared:This you should understand and strive for: As much as a personexamines [something], that much will her mind be moldedthrough the thoughts that dwell on this.640Finally, on the Buddhist path, it is always emphasized that we should gainfirsthand experience, direct knowledge, and personal certainty about the waythings really are. Just as with our ordinary experiences in life, whatever we our-selves have thoroughly examined and found to be true will be an incontrovert-ible part of our experience. Then we no longer need to rely on other people orbooks. Doubts will not arise, nor will our minds be changed by others’ ques-tioning our realization. Moreover, when we have an experientially foundedunderstanding of the correct view, we will increasingly be able to evaluate anyexperiences that might come up in our meditation practice. We can comparethem with the correct Centrist view of emptiness and see clearly whether ourpractice and realization accords with what the Buddha and the great mastersdescribe. In this way, analytical meditation is also very helpful for and informsany other meditation practices, such as deity visualization.Calm Abiding and Superior InsightMeditation in Centrism, as in all other Buddhist schools, is divided into twogeneral types: calm abiding and superior insight. One usually begins with calmabiding and then, on the basis of a calm and one-pointed mind, progresses towardsuperior insight. As proficiency is developed, the two types of meditation arepracticed as an inseparable unity. In the middle volume of his Stages of Medita-tion, KamalaŸıla describes this:In the beginning, one should practice calm abiding for a while. Oncedistraction toward outer objects has become calm, one abides in a stateof mind that is very supple and delights in being continually and nat-urally engaged in focusing inward. This is called calm abiding. Whilefocusing on the calm abiding of the [mind], one analyzes this very[mind]. This is superior insight.641The classic metaphor for the necessity of uniting calm abiding and superiorinsight is a candle flame. When this flame is bright and there is no wind, it is276The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 276"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"clearly visible and will also illuminate its surroundings. However, if the flame isbright but flickers in the wind, it will neither be seen distinctly itself nor clearlylight up anything else. Likewise, if our mind is endowed with both the superiorinsight that sees true reality and the quality of calm abiding, through which wecan one-pointedly direct this insight wherever we please, this mind will see bothits own nature and the nature of all phenomena. Once the obscurations areremoved, the light of wisdom appears just as sunlight in a cloud-free sky unim-pededly illuminates everything.However, if we have only cultivated undistracted meditative concentrationand lack the supreme knowledge that realizes how things actually are, it is impos-sible to see ultimate reality. On the other hand, if we have the correct view ofunderstanding identitylessness but no meditative concentration in which themind rests one-pointedly, our mind will be distracted by other objects, not beunder control, and thus not be workable. Consequently, it will be impossible forthe light of wisdom to shine clearly and realize ultimate reality. Another analogyfor the need to combine calm abiding and superior insight as an inseparable unityis a sharp scalpel in the steady hand of an experienced surgeon. If the scalpel isblunt or the surgeon’s hand shaky, the operation cannot be performed properly.In the same way, when the mind rests in a state that involves both stillness anda crisp wakefulness or awareness, it is like a steady hand that deftly operates onour objects of investigation with the sharp blade of superior insight.Since there is a wealth of materials available on the actual training in calmabiding, I will not go into detail here. The essential point of calm abiding inCentrism is to settle the mind within a still yet clear awareness, one-pointedlyfocused, thus serving as the proper ground for effective engagement in the Cen-trist analyses of the two types of identitylessness. Any of the numerous techniquesto accomplish calm abiding can be used to reach this state. The prerequisites forsuperior insight are stated in KamalaŸıla’s Stages of Meditation:One may wonder, “What are the prerequisites for superior insight?”[They are] relying on a genuine teacher, making every effort in exten-sive studies, and appropriate reflection.642These three prerequisites depend on each other. By relying on a teacher whofully masters the Buddha’s teachings, one studies the authentic texts and thendevelops the correct view of emptiness through the two kinds of knowledge thatcome from studying and reflecting. If the unmistaken view is not developed withcertainty, the very basis with which one is to familiarize oneself during the med-itation of superior insight is missing. Moreover, in order to develop such a viewand make it incontrovertible, it is crucial to rely on the definitive rather than theexpedient meaning. Consequently, for the understanding of the profound defin-The Middle from Beginning to End 277Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 277"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"itive teachings to dawn, it must necessarily be preceded by knowledge of the dif-ference between these two levels of teaching.Superior insight in Centrism can be classified as two:1) a preparatory stage of “discriminating superior insight”6432) the actual main practice of nonconceptual “motionless superior insight,” inwhich there is no duality of meditator and object of meditationOn the basis of a mind that is calm and one-pointed, the two types of identity-lessness are analyzed through supreme knowledge. In the second stage, mind isfully aware of and rests right within its own expanse free from all reference points.All Centrist masters agree that the dawning of nondual wisdom results fromthe conjoined practice of calm abiding and superior insight, though they may giveslightly different methods for developing that unity. For example, according toBh›vaviveka, cultivating calm abiding is the first step, in which one trains throughcontemplating such topics as the repulsiveness of the body, loving-kindness, andcompassion. Then, superior insight is generated through the power of Centristreasoning. According to ⁄›ntideva, calm abiding is developed by meditating onthe mind of enlightenment, and the supreme knowledge of superior insight isgenerated through focusing on emptiness. KamalaŸıla recommends training incalm abiding by using an object, such as an image of the Buddha, and then pro-ceeding to superior insight through analysis of the nature of this very object ofcalm abiding. According to Candrakırti, both calm abiding and superior insightare to be practiced based on the view that analyzes true reality. All these expla-nations agree that first calm abiding, then superior insight, and finally their unityare to be practiced in this order, since they are related as causes and results in thisway. In general, the main point in all three of these steps is that the mind be one-pointed and undistracted.When do calm abiding and superior insight become a unity? There are differ-ent levels of unity. During the practice of calm abiding and superior insight “withcharacteristics”—when specific focuses or mental images are used in medita-tion—the unity occurs when the calmly abiding, thought-free mind that focuseson these mental images and the realization of superior insight that thoroughly dis-criminates all phenomena based on such images naturally blend into one. In thefurther stage of practicing calm abiding and superior insight “without character-istics,” once both nonconceptual calm abiding and nonconceptual superiorinsight are attained, they are one in nature and thus said to be a unity. In otherwords, cultivating the still aspect of our mind means practicing calm abiding, andlooking at the nature of both its still and its moving aspects is superior insight.Within the luminous nature of the mind that underlies both its stillness and its278The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 278"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"movement, these two aspects are an inseparable unity, so calm abiding and supe-rior insight each serve to approach this very unity. Thus, these two meditations’having become a unity means nothing but naturally resting in the nature of themind and recognizing whatever appears within it as being that nature. In thissense, the perfection of the unity of calm abiding and superior insight is callednonabiding nirv› ̊a. As Pawo Rinpoche says, both N›g›rjuna’s lineage of pro-found view and Asaºga’s lineage of vast activity644agree on this:Both traditions agree that the unity of perfect meditative stability andknowledge is to rest right within profound knowledge’s seeing that iswithout seeing anything and to do so in a way that is without some-one who rests and something to be rested in.645Finally, when rising from meditative equipoise, with the awareness that all phe-nomena are illusionlike, one extensively engages in the accumulation of merit.Analytical Meditation and Resting MeditationAnother division of meditation is into “the analytical meditation of scholars”646and “the resting meditation of mendicants,”647or simply analytical meditationand resting meditation.The analytical meditation of scholars refers to the intellectual examination ofall phenomena through reasoning. There are two key terms here: “discriminat-ing knowledge” and “personally experienced wisdom.” The first step in this ana-lytical meditation is to cultivate discriminating knowledge. This refers to all thelevels of increasingly refined inferential valid cognition that are based on reason-ing and developed through studying, reflecting, and meditating. In other words,this is the laser beam of penetrating analysis that scans its various objects once wehave one-pointedly focused the diffuse light of our usual discursive thinking.The second term, “personally experienced wisdom,” stands for true reality—theunity of wisdom and expanse—directly and nonconceptually realizing itself byitself in a way that is without anything realizing anything.The way in which ordinary beings engage in analytical meditation during med-itative equipoise is mainly through discriminating knowledge and also througha mere likeness of personally experienced wisdom. The latter refers to the mosthighly refined discriminating knowledge that eventually turns into the actualpersonally experienced wisdom. In general, ordinary beings are understood tobe all those who have not directly realized true reality or emptiness, that is, thosewho have not yet reached the path of seeing. On the other hand, those who havedirectly realized emptiness—the noble ones—engage in meditative equipoisethrough personally experienced wisdom only. So once discriminating knowledgeThe Middle from Beginning to End 279Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 279"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"has reached its highest level of refinement at the last moment of the path of junc-tion (illustrated by the well-known example of the two sticks and the fire), theactual personally experienced wisdom springs from it, which marks the beginningof the path of seeing. Thus, through causal discriminating knowledge—whichincludes resting within the doubt-free certainty that is induced through the ana-lytical power of this knowledge—the fruitional personally experienced wisdomof the unity of awareness and expanse is attained.This analytical meditation of scholars belongs to the usual gradual approachof the sÒtra vehicle. It provides a very firm and clear basis for our practice. Oncewe have established such a basis, we will no longer make any big mistakes in ourmeditation. Through gradual study, reflection, and meditation, definite certaintyis gained that does not depend on anything or anybody else to tell us how thingsare. Such unflinching conviction comes solely from our own personal and properexamination of the teachings, which completely eliminates all doubts. At thispoint, nobody can make us feel that we are wrong. Even the Buddha could notchange our mind. This kind of certainty is necessary so that there is not theslightest room for mistakes or doubts to sneak in again. Sometimes, we seem tounderstand something, but if we do not decide on it in a way that is sufficientlyclear and certain enough, then doubts may arise again and destroy our initialunderstanding, so that no stable progress is possible.Resting meditation is also called stabilizing meditation. Obviously, it does notrefer to just taking a rest and doing nothing but to letting the mind naturally andone-pointedly rest in its own nature with full mindfulness and alertness. “Theresting meditation of mendicants in a more narrow sense corresponds to theimmediate style of the Vajray›na. Thus, it is said to be the swifter path that canbring results quite soon. However, at the same time, it is less easy to describe andgrasp, since it deals straightaway with the nature of the mind, which cannot bepinpointed as anything whatsoever. Consequently, it may happen that we arenot really sure what is going on in our meditation and what we actually haveunderstood. There may be flashes of directly seeing the nature of the mind fromtime to time, but there is also the danger of not really seeing anything of thekind and just spacing out in some dull, blank state. Contrary to that, the ana-lytical approach is a safeguard against falling into such a state, which is called “themeditation of a fool.” Thus, in order to proceed on the correct path, the approachof the resting meditation of mendicants depends very much on the correct ini-tial pointing-out instructions, the continuous qualified guidance, and the bless-ings of a true guru.The terms “analytical meditation of scholars” and “resting meditation of men-dicants” should not be taken too literally or exclusively. Some people think thatthe meditation of scholars is purely analytical and that yogic practitioners exclu-sively practice resting meditation, but this is not at all the case. Rather, such des-280The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 280"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"ignations are a matter of degree. The scholarly approach to meditation also needsthe element of resting or calm abiding in order for the practitioner to stay focusedon the object of meditation and to settle in the certainty that has arisen from thepreceding analysis. Likewise, yogic practitioners are in need of analytical medi-tation in order to purify their view of distortions and doubts. If these two are notkept in balance, then any kind of vision of ultimate reality that is attained solelythrough analytical meditation is a mere intellectual exercise, while the kinds ofvisions that are achieved through resting meditation alone are just further fleet-ing and indiscriminate mental experiences among our many others. Therefore,both elements of analysis and resting are indispensable for realizing the essenceof meditation, regardless of which approach is personally preferred.The general scope of analytical meditation encompasses all of the teachings ofthe Buddha, starting from contemplating impermanence and the preciousness ofhuman existence up through ascertaining the two kinds of identitylessness. Rest-ing meditation includes all types of meditations in which the conclusionsachieved through preceding investigation become absorbed by the mind. Thefreshness of such absorptive resting of the mind is sustained through one-pointedmindfulness and alertness.Centrist meditation, for the most part, follows the analytical approach. How-ever, once the state of nonconceptual superior insight is attained and blendedwith nonconceptual calm abiding, the meditating mind finally realizes and restsin its own nature. Hence, also in Centrism, the above two approaches are not inconflict but, properly practiced, enhance each other. When inferential analysisand insight that are informed by Centrist reasonings are combined with directlylooking at our mind (during as well as after the analysis), it is actually possible todevelop a very stable and alert mind as well as rapidly progress on the path of pro-found realization.As for the relation between analytical and resting meditation on the one sideand calm abiding and superior insight on the other, calm abiding is not exactlythe same as resting meditation, nor is superior insight equivalent to analyticalmeditation. Rather, analytical and resting meditation each include both calmabiding and superior insight.The main aspect of resting meditation is the mind’s calm abiding, since it pri-marily means to rest in the nature of the mind. However, this resting itself even-tually assumes the quality of superior insight by directly looking at mind’s nature.As for analytical meditation, it also includes both calm abiding and superior insight,since any mental investigation—be it conceptual or nonconceptual—needs to beperformed on the basis of a calm and one-pointed mind. However, both pairs ofmeditation have the same final goal. Analytical and resting meditation eventuallybecome a unity, just as calm abiding and superior insight. Ultimately, they havethe same destination: the direct realization of the nature of the mind.The Middle from Beginning to End 281Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 281"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Some people think that when one practices calm abiding, there is no need to doany analysis, and when practicing superior insight, one does not need to rest themind in meditative equipoise. However, during calm abiding, some degree ofanalysis is definitely required in order to determine whether the mind is still one-pointedly focused, how to deal with thoughts or afflictions that come up, and howto clear away the various obstacles to calm abiding, such as dullness and agitation.Different methods must also be employed to still the mind, and these methodsinvolve scrutiny of the meditative state and its flaws. On the other hand, in supe-rior insight, the emphasis is on developing the clarity of prajñ›, but this works allthe better the more the mind is resting in a one-pointed and undistracted way.Other people think that analytical meditation and resting meditation aremutually exclusive, that the mind cannot rest while analyzing nor engage in inves-tigation when resting. They regard analysis as a completely intellectual kind ofdiscrimination and resting meditation as a totally nonconceptual kind of absorp-tion. However, as indicated by the example of a candle flame without wind, thecalmer the mind, the more clearly the light of prajñ› can illuminate all phe-nomena. Otherwise, if analytical and resting meditation were mutually exclu-sive, this would have a number of absurd consequences. For example, it wouldthen be a mistake to use one’s discriminative capacity in mastering the varioustechniques of calm abiding and to eliminate the obstacles that may occur in thisprocess. It would furthermore be impossible for the analyzing mind to eventu-ally settle into a resting state at the end of the analysis. However, many Centristmasters repeatedly and clearly describe that it indeed is the analyzing mind thatcomes to rest. As ⁄›ntideva’s Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life says:Once one has analyzed what had to be analyzed,The analysis does not have any basis left.Since there is no basis, it does not continue.This is expressed as nirv› ̊a.648AtıŸa concurs in his Centrist Pith Instructions:Once all specifically characterized and generally characterized phe-nomena are established as nonexistent [through knowledge], thisknowledge itself is without appearance, luminous, and not establishedas any nature whatsoever. Thus, all flaws, such as dullness and agita-tion, are eliminated. In this interval, consciousness is without anythought, does not apprehend anything, and has left behind all mind-fulness and mental engagement. For as long as neither characteristicsnor the enemies and robbers of thoughts arise, consciousness shouldrest in such a [state].649282The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 282"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"N›g›rjuna’sCommentary on the Mind of Enlightenmentalso touches on the sametopic:So-called entities are conceptions.Lack of conceptions is emptiness.Wherever conceptions appear,How could there be emptiness?650His Sixty Stanzas on Reasoningdeclares:Those whose minds are not moved,Not even by a flicker of a thought about “complete voidness,”Have crossed the horrifying ocean of existenceThat is agitated by the snakes of the afflictions.651Also KamalaŸıla’s Stages of Meditationrepeatedly talks about nonconceptual andunmoving superior insight:Once the mind has become stabilized on its focus through calm abid-ing, if one examines this [mind] through supreme knowledge, the bril-liance of perfect wisdom will dawn. At this point, just as darkness isdispelled through bright daylight, obscurations are eliminated. Likeone’s eyes and light [in producing a visual perception], both [calmabiding and superior insight] are mutually compatible with regard tothe emerging of perfect wisdom. It is not that they are incompatiblein the way that light and darkness are. The nature of meditative con-centration is not darkness. What is it then? Its defining characteristicis a one-pointed mind. [The Buddha] said:If one rests in meditative equipoise, one perfectly realizes trueactuality just as it is.Therefore, [calm abiding] is very much in harmony with supremeknowledge and not at all incompatible. Thus, when examiningthrough supreme knowledge that rests in meditative equipoise, thevery nonobservation of all phenomena is genuine nonobservation. Thischaracteristic of the state of calm abiding of yogic practitioners meansspontaneous presence, since there is nothing else to be seen beyondthat. Calmness means that all discursiveness of characteristics, such asexistence and nonexistence, is completely at peace.652andThe Middle from Beginning to End 283Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 283"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"As for the seeing of genuine true reality, it is the very fact that there isnothing to be seen, when the light of perfect wisdom dawns throughthe examination of all phenomena with the eye of supreme knowl-edge. This is also expressed in the sÒtras:One may wonder, “What is seeing the ultimate?” It means thatall phenomena are not seen.Here, [the Buddha] has talked about “not seeing” by having in mindthat there is no such seeing. However, this “not seeing” is not like notseeing when the conditions [for seeing] are incomplete (such as in ablind person and when closing one’s eyes) or when one does not men-tally engage [in seeing].653Pawo Rinpoche summarizes:In brief, the very quintessence of all meditative concentrations of boththe sÒtras and the tantras of the great vehicle is to see, through supremeknowledge in a way that is without seeing, that no phenomenon what-soever abides as anything, such as existence or nonexistence, and toundistractedly and nonconceptually rest in this very seeing.654Thus, the question of whether a nonconceptual meditative state concords withthe perfect view can be decided by determining whether clear wakefulness, mind-fulness, and alertness that are reinforced and sustained by a determinate, imme-diate awareness of the perfect view are present or absent in the nonconceptualstate in question. From this, it is clear that such nonconceptual meditation isnot at all like ordinary nonconceptual states such as deep sleep, a faint, or a coma.In the same vein, as these quotations—and many others—amply show, there isnot the slightest foundation in Centrist texts for the claims of Tsongkhapa andothers that every nonconceptual meditative equipoise that is free from any modeof apprehension655is identical to the infamous meditation style of just not think-ing anything that is ascribed by Tibetans to the Chinese master Hvashang.Some people erroneously think that the state of superior insight ceases whenresting meditation progresses. Thus, they claim that superior insight is necessar-ily always linked to the discerning mind. However, in that case, it would beimpossible to ever achieve the unity of calm abiding and superior insight. Thisposition also denies the eventual oneness of nonconceptual direct looking andsuperior insight. Actually, superior insight is not lost when the analyzing prajñ›comes to rest after having performed the analysis. Eventually, this very settlingof the discriminating aspect of the mind into mind’s own spacious and lumi-284The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 284"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"nous nature is the point of supreme and pure superior insight. Such insight isinseparable from resting in this nature in which there is not the slightest trace ofduality, such as subject and object, analyzer and analyzed, or what rests and whatit rests in. As N›g›rjuna’s Commentary on the Mind of Enlightenmentsays:The Thus-Gone Ones do not see a mindThat involves the aspects of a realizer and what is to be realized.Wherever there is a realizer and what is to be realized ,There is no enlightenment.656What is the difference between analytical meditation and just reflecting? Thecrucial distinction is that, in analytical meditation, our scrutinizing prajñ› oper-ates within a state of mind that is calm and one-pointed, thus bringing the objectof analysis very clearly to mind and also being able to stay with it. Moreover,through alternating analysis with nonconceptual resting in the certainty thatresults from the preceding analysis, this approach taps into much deeper levels ofthe mind than any pondering on a superficial, intellectual plane. Based on calmabiding, the mind is like a clear mirror or a calm lake in which we can clearly seeour own true face—mind’s nature—and have a proper look at all its facets andfeatures.Thus, when beginning to train in calm abiding, one mainly cultivates restingmeditation, as, for example, outlined in the nine stages of settling the mind.657Still, once calm abiding is achieved, analysis must be applied. To this end, inBuddhism, many general methods of analytical meditation are recommendedduring the state of calm abiding, such as contemplating the repulsiveness of thebody as an antidote to desire, love and compassion as an antidote to hatred, ordependent origination to ignorance. In particular, in Centrism, the main prac-tices of analytical meditation are the investigations of twofold identitylessness asthey were described earlier.Working with the Mind in Meditation and Daily LifeIf we lack an understanding of the view of identitylessness or emptiness, any kindof meditation that we do will necessarily miss the point as far as ultimate realityis concerned. Hence, it is important to first establish this view. However, evenwhen endowed with a correct understanding of the view, if we do not meditateby properly resting in such an understanding, our meditation will likewise beout of touch with true reality. Thus, in Centrism, the main part of meditationconsists of both the initial analysis of the two types of identitylessness throughsupreme knowledge and the subsequent resting within the expanse that is freefrom all mental reference points.The Middle from Beginning to End 285Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 285"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"There are two types of training in calm abiding: calm abiding with supportand without support, which is mind just resting in its own nature. Supports areagain twofold: outer objects (such as a pebble or a Buddha statue) and innerobjects. The latter are all kinds of mental images or visualizations, which maycorrespond to outer objects (such as visualizing a Buddha statue) or not (suchas visualizing deities or mantric syllables). All of these are called nonconceptualmental images,658since they do not involve any thoughts that analyze for ulti-mate reality.When practicing superior insight, we meditate by taking such mental imagesthat, through the power of calm abiding, clearly appear in our mind as the basesfor discriminating analysis. Thus, this is not an analysis that is outwardly directed,since the mind only looks inward, at its own images. When such images thatarise from meditative concentration are analyzed through superior insight inorder to realize true reality, this involves thoughts that examine this true reality.Accordingly, these images are called conceptual mental images.659Through theexamination of the nature of such images, the nature of all phenomena is realizedas it is. This process can be compared to examining the appearance of our facein a mirror. The reflection in the mirror is not our face, but it clearly reveals allthe beautiful or ugly features of this face and in this way we can deal with ouractual face. Candrakırti uses this analogy in his Entrance into Centrism:Although [the reflection of our face in a mirror] is not real, it is there forthe purpose of beautifying this face.Likewise, also here, our arguments are seenTo have the capacity of cleansing the face of knowledge.660Especially at the beginning of our practice of analytical meditation, each objectmust be investigated individually. For if a particular object with certain featureshas not been clearly identified as the basis for analysis, it is not possible to cutthrough all the superimpositions with regard to these features. The particularobject is then analyzed by means of correct discriminating knowledge and thusis conceptually ascertained to be something that appears while lacking any realnature of its own. While we undistractedly keep the object of meditative con-centration in mind, conceptual discrimination is increasingly refined and even-tually terminates all by itself, once its equally subtle objects are found to beunfindable. Eventually, this process gives way to the direct and nonconceptualrealization that this very object is a mere appearance but has no nature of its own.Thus, by blending the focus of calm abiding and superior insight into one, wetrain in unifying them.This process of meditating by focusing on particular objects can be outlinedas follows. We start our analytical meditation by taking an outer object, such as286The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 286"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"a table, as our focus of analysis. In order to realize through discriminating knowl-edge that this table is empty, the point is simply to focus on the plain mentalimage of this table and to apply Centrist reasoning to it. Thus, when analyzingthe table’s nature, we do not consider or focus on its specific characteristics, suchas its color, shape, size, or attractiveness. By extending our investigation to otherobjects of the sense perceptions and so on, we become aware of the emptiness ofall the objects that we apprehend, which is like resting in the center of openspace. To train in this awareness is called “the yoga of not observing the appre-hended,”661which means to meditate on everything external as being the unity ofappearance and emptiness.Next, we proceed to the stage of using internal objects of focus, such as our var-ious expressions of consciousness that are the subjects apprehending the aboveobjects. When an instance of apprehending subjective consciousness, such ashatred or desire, arises in our mind stream, we should clearly identify it and thenexamine it, as if under a magnifying glass, through discriminating knowledge.What is its cause? Where did it come from in the first place? Does it abide on theoutside or the inside? Does it have any nature? What is its shape or color? Bydoing this, we will not find this emotion to be anything whatsoever. Then, weshould rest in meditative equipoise in this very actuality of not finding anything.This approach is to be applied not only to any afflictions that may come up inour mind but to the entire range of mental events (such as feelings), to our senseconsciousnesses, and to our thoughts. Whether the latter are positive, negative,or just neutral, random thoughts, we should be aware of any thought that arisesand use it for our meditation in the way described. This does not mean that wetry to rest in meditative equipoise by just observing or focusing on our thoughts,but we train in resting in their very essence, which is emptiness free from refer-ence points. This is “the yoga of not observing the apprehender,”662which meansmeditating on all internal states of mind as being the unity of awareness andemptiness.After having searched for a real existence of both subject and object, we findneither. In the end, neither the object to be examined (be it external matter orinternal mind) nor the examining mind (supreme knowledge) itself is found inany way. In this way, the analysis is self-terminating, just as a fire springs to lifewhen two sticks are rubbed together and then is extinguished once the sticksburn up. At this point, we just rest within this state without any grasping. At thispoint, even our analyzing mind has vanished into the vast space of the expanseof dharmas free from all reference points. The mind that familiarizes itself withthe expanse of dharmas and what it familiarizes with—this very expanse—arenot different. Rather, just like water that is poured into water, they are revealedas being one. Naturally, in this state, there is no one resting and nothing that isrested in.

As forthe mind that realizes [this], when thoroughly investigating its nature,it is also realized to be empty. Realizing [both of] these in this way, itis said that “the yoga of signlessness”663is entered. This teaches thatsignlessness is entered through this being preceded by discrimination.664In Centrism, all of this is just a conventional description from the perspective ofothers for the sake of their understanding, given through the supreme knowledgeof Buddhas and bodhisattvas who realize the expanse of dharmas. Actually, thereis no realizer nor something to be realized here.During most of our attempts, we will shift between one type of meditation andthe other. If our ability to rest evenly decreases due to extensive analytical med-itation or if we become distracted, then resting meditation should be empha-sized in order to restore the still aspect of the mind. On the other hand, if we erron the side of too much resting meditation, we will lose interest in the analysisand become dull. We should then return to analytical meditation. Especially forbeginners, it is necessary and very helpful to alternate analytical and resting med-itation. If we do not alternate analyzing and resting in our practice of superiorinsight, it will deteriorate and at best become just calm abiding. However, thegoal is always to approach the unity of calm abiding and superior insight, sincetrue meditation and realization blossom only when these two have blended intoone. When the unity of calm abiding and superior insight is experienced, weshould just settle in and gently sustain this effortless equanimity without inter-fering with it in any way. As long as the mind stays in this natural state of rest-ing insight, there is no need to go back to any conceptual analysis, since this stateis the supreme kind of nonconceptual superior insight. It is the living experienceof certainty about emptiness acquired through the preceding conceptual analysis.This process can also be understood in terms of the three types of awareness:awareness of something other, self-awareness, and awareness of the lack of a nature.In the context of analytical and resting meditation, the first awareness correspondsto the stage of analytical meditation. During analysis, our awareness deals withobjects that, conventionally speaking, are different from the analyzing awarenessitself, such as outer objects, conceptual images, and investigations of these images.The second type of awareness—self-awareness—corresponds to the resting med-itation of ordinary beings, since there is neither focusing on outer objects nor anyconceptual analysis going on. Rather, at this point, the emphasis is on the minddirectly experiencing itself as being without concepts but pervaded by and insep-arable from the taste of some new insight. The third type of awareness—the aware-ness of the lack of a nature—is the actual perfect experience of the unity of calmabiding and superior insight that directly and nonconceptually realizes and at thesame time rests in emptiness, the true nature of phenomena.288The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 288"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"An analogy for these three stages is the process of making a sweet drink. Thefirst step is to pulverize the big, hard sugar chunks of our rigid worldviews throughthe grinder of conceptual analysis. The resultant fine sugar powder of certaintylooks nice and delicate, but it is not of much use if it does not become mixed withthe water of our mind. Thus, the second stage is to let this fine sugar dissolve inthe water of our mind stream and become one with it. Since the powder is so fine,it blends into the water much more quickly and easily than a big chunk of sugarwould. The third stage is the direct experience of relishing the single taste of sweetwater in which sugar and water have become completely inseparable.In brief, calm abiding and superior insight are most effective when practicedequally as described. This is clearly expressed in many meditation manuals, suchas The Stages of Meditation:Through the cultivation of superior insight, supreme knowledgebecomes very prominent. Since calm abiding is weaker at this time, likean oil lamp that is placed in the wind, the mind may waver. Therefore,true reality is not clearly seen. Calm abiding should be cultivated at thispoint. Then, if calm abiding becomes excessive, supreme knowledgeshould again be cultivated. When a balance of these two is attained, aslong as body and mind do not ache, one should dwell [in that bal-anced state] without interfering [with it]. When the body and so onstarts to ache, as long as this interval lasts, the whole world should beregarded as being like an illusion, a mirage, a dream, a [reflection of]the moon [in] water, and an optical illusion. . . . Furthermore, greatcompassion and the mind of enlightenment [for the sake of those whodo not realize true reality] should be brought forth. Then, take a rest.[After a while,] in the same way [as before], one should once moreenter the meditative concentration in which all phenomena do notappear. When the mind becomes fatigued again, take a rest in the sameway [as described]. This is the path of the unification of calm abidingand superior insight, which is to [alternately] focus on conceptual andnonconceptual images.665When we rise from formal meditation sessions, our practice does not simplystop. Rather, during the periods between these sessions, we try to bring what wehave realized or attained in meditation into our daily lives as much as possible.This is why these phases are called subsequent attainment. In this phase, we donot reject anything that appears from the perspective of our everyday level ofconsciousness, while, from the perspective of wisdom, we do not make any ofthese appearances into a reference point. Within this state, we gather as much ofthe accumulation of merit as we are able to. In this way, the accumulation ofThe Middle from Beginning to End 289Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 289"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"merit is conjoined with the supreme knowledge that is free from the referencepoints of the three spheres (agent, object, and action).In particular, in between our sessions, we train in the thirty-seven dharmas thatconcord with enlightenment.666The enumeration of these thirty-seven factors inthe great vehicle is the same as in the tradition of the hearers, but the focus isvaster and more profound. This may be illustrated through the first set of thesethirty-seven, the fourfold application of mindfulness667on the lesser path of accu-mulation. The hearers use this practice as a method for exploring the pervasive-ness of suffering, impermanence, and the lack of a personal self. The great vehiclegoes further and has us regard our body, our feelings, our mind, and all phe-nomena as being without any nature in order to cultivate an understanding thatthey are nonconceptual in essence. This is the profound aspect of these practices.In addition, we cultivate the recognition of our body as being like an illusion, ourfeelings as being like a dream, our mind as being like luminous space, and all phe-nomena as being like fleeting clouds. This represents the vast aspect of such four-fold mindfulness. In this way, we enhance our realization of the inseparability ofappearance and emptiness. As we do so, all differences between meditativeequipoise and subsequent attainment gradually vanish. When these two phaseshave become inseparable, the realization of true reality is unchanging in all situ-ations, which is nothing other than Buddhahood.How to Practice a Session of Analytical MeditationA session of Buddhist analytical meditation starts with taking refuge in the threejewels and generating the mind of enlightenment. There follows a brief period ofcalm abiding to create the proper ground for engaging in the actual analysis.Then, within this state of calm abiding, we clearly bring to mind the particularobject to be analyzed. This could be the first thing that comes to mind; however,especially when involved in training in the progressive stages of meditation onemptiness as outlined below, we should choose an object that suits our individ-ual level in terms of our investigation of either personal or phenomenal iden-titylessness. As a guideline for our analysis, we mainly apply the reasonings andconsiderations described in the preceding discussions of twofold identitylessnessand Centrist reasoning (such as the five great Centrist reasonings and the seven-fold reasoning using the analogy of a chariot).As a preparatory step for beginners, it is fine to read through these reasoningsone at a time, to recite them , and thus clearly bring them to mind. The idea isnot just to echo such reasonings as if turning a prayer wheel or reciting a mantrabut—once we are more familiar with them—to be a little bit more creative inour analytical approach. Our creativity and inspiration to engage in analysis willcertainly not bloom if we regard analytical meditation as dry mental gymnastics290The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 290"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"or the repetition of sterile formulas. Rather, Centrist analytical meditation ismeant to provide the ground for experimenting with our basic curiosity andopenness to investigate ourselves and the world around us. Thus, it is often quitehelpful to consider what we actually want to know about this world and our-selves—what our real questions of immediate personal concern are—and thento apply Centrist principles of investigation, rather than to just follow the beatenpath of standardized reasonings against standardized opponents as found in Cen-trist texts. For example, we may feel overworked and depressed, have an identitycrisis, quarrel with our partner, see someone as our enemy, or be very happy andnewly in love, or self-indulgent, or proud—all these states can be scrutinized fortheir solidity and reality. This includes coming up with our own reasons, exam-ples, and questions. Furthermore, instead of trying to prove emptiness or iden-titylessness, we may as well take the opposite route, looking for reasons thatthings really exist and then checking out whether these reasons withstandanalysis.Whichever approach we choose, it is important to pick a distinct object (suchas our head or a chair), clearly bring it to mind, and then stay with it as ourobject of analysis until some degree of certainty as to its features—or the lackthereof—is achieved. This means that there is no point in just thinking in a gen-eral way, “All phenomena are empty,” or “Everything is beyond unity and mul-tiplicity,” without really having a clear picture of any particular phenomenon, letalone all phenomena. Nor is it helpful to jump from one object to the next everyfew minutes without having gone any deeper. Especially in the beginning, it isvery important to restrict our analysis to a rather limited portion of a given objector topic and to try to gain some certainty about it. This is accomplished throughlooking into it as thoroughly as possible. For example, if we feel that our head isnot our self, we should not just leave it at this feeling but try to come up with asmany reasons as we can find that explain why it is not the self, or to find theabsurd consequences if indeed it were the self.The next step is to go beyond conceptual analysis in order to gain incontro-vertible, experiential certainty. Conceptual analysis (whether we use Centrist rea-sonings or another approach) will serve only to enhance our conceptual orintellectual certainty. Such analysis is important as a start, but it is not sufficientto affect the deeper levels of our latent tendencies of reification. Hence, we mustproceed to absorb whatever degree of conceptual certainty we may have attainedby resting in this certainty in a nonconceptual way that is free from referencepoints. Through this method, we familiarize our minds with the insights that wehave gained through the preceding analysis. For example, once we have attainedcertainty that our head is not our self, we should stop analyzing but maintain one-pointed mindfulness and alertness and just let this certainty sink in deeply. If wefeel that we have not gained any understanding or insight at all, we just practiceThe Middle from Beginning to End 291Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 291"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"calm abiding for a while and then resume the analysis until some insight dawns.Especially at the beginning, such insights do not have to be great, profoundinsights into emptiness or what holds the world together. Rather, we may andshould use any level of new understanding about our specific object of analysis.When we rest the mind in this way and thus absorb our newly developed con-victions, the analyzing facet of our mind naturally settles into mind’s nature, justas a wave rolls back into the ocean or the space within a cup becomes one withthe infinity of all space once the cup is broken. In this way, discriminating knowl-edge is also nothing but the unity of awareness and the expanse of dharmas, inwhich no traces of analyzing subject and analyzed object can be found. In thisway, we allow for and cultivate a very lucid nonconceptual certainty on the levelof immediate experience that gradually can become an intrinsic and natural partof our way of seeing the world and acting in it. In other words, this is the way tochange our instinctive habits and to bring the understanding we have from ourhead into our heart.What is the reason for alternating between analyzing and resting? In brief,each approach performs a different but mutually enhancing function. Analyzingmeans seeing through our useless grasping, while resting provides the space toadapt to this seeing. Through analytical meditation, we relinquish our many-layered conscious and unconscious reifying tendencies of holding on to a selfand to things as really existent. The remedy for these tendencies is the irreversiblecertainty that there are neither real things nor a self. These two mental states—reification, which is to be relinquished, and certainty about emptiness as its rem-edy—are mutually exclusive and cannot exist in our mind at the same time, justas it is impossible to experience love and hatred simultaneously. Therefore, towhatever degree reification becomes gradually undermined through analysis, tothat same degree certainty about emptiness increases.Finally, even if we do not enhance such understanding through further explicitanalysis, experiential certainty arises naturally through the power of having repeat-edly cultivated it during the phases of analytical and resting meditation. At thispoint, other than just resting in this very state of the lucid presence of such cer-tainty, there is no need to actively or deliberately redevelop it over again, sincewe have already accomplished this certainty through prior analysis. For example,when we have determined through close examination that a hose with a zigzagpattern is not a snake, this very certainty stops us from apprehending the hose asa snake. To continue to analyze the hose at this point and to keep telling our-selves, “It is not a snake” would seem pointless and foolish. However, we mightneed to take a minute to let that knowledge sink in and see the consequences ofthere being no snake in the hose. Then, once we have gained irreversible cer-tainty that there is no snake and this conviction has become a natural part of ourexperience, the thought of such a hose being a snake will never cross our mind292The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 292"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"again. We might even laugh at our own previous confusion the next time wehappen to see a hose with zigzag pattern.Thus, it is important not to do just a bit of analysis and then drop it, totallyforgetting about any insights (however limited they may be) that we have gainedthrough this analysis and shifting into mere calm abiding. In other words, analy-sis and calm abiding should not be alternated in a completely unrelated or arbi-trary way. Rather, there should be some sense that the insights gained throughanalysis are being carried over into the phase of resting meditation. To facilitatebringing the analysis into the resting phase, it is helpful to briefly summarize theinsight from our analysis in one sentence before engaging in the actual restingmeditation. Beginners may want to briefly recall whatever insight has beenobtained a few times during the resting meditation and then let it sink in again.After resting the mind in this way for a while, or when the mind starts to get dull,we resume our analysis of the same object. We do not have to start our analysisanew but can just continue from where we stopped before the resting meditation.Depending on how complete our analysis has been, we may also shift to anotherobject at this point.If in this process we get distracted and lose our focus on the object of analy-sis, we may initially try to gently bring our mind back to the object and continueinvestigating it. If, however, our analysis becomes discursive and the mind runsall over the place, or if we become too tired and thus cannot focus anymore, weshould not push or strain. Strained analytical meditation deteriorates into mereordinary thinking, in which one train of thought just follows after the other with-out leading anywhere. As long as there is precision, clarity, and mindfulness dur-ing the investigation, it is analytical meditation, but if these features are lacking,it is neither analysis nor meditation. Hence, when we become aware that ouranalysis loses these qualities, then it is definitely better to shift into a period ofcalm abiding. If that does not help either, we should simply take a break. Just sitand relax, without trying to do any meditation at all for a while. After a while,we can resume the analysis where we left off while still in a state of clear focus.Another possibility at that point is to end the session altogether by dedicating allthe positivity that arose from our meditation and come back for another sessionlater. In between sessions, as described earlier, we engage in the illusionlike accu-mulation of merit while pursuing our everyday activities.It is generally much better to meditate repeatedly for short periods with goodconcentration and wakefulness than to ineffectively prolong a state of distrac-tion or mental fatigue and misconstrue this as meditation. The latter will even-tually make us fed up with meditation. Thus, it is said that the best way tomeditate is to start out by welcoming meditation like a dear old friend and to stopmeditating while we are still good friends. If we end our session while still focusedand awake, we will look forward to coming back to that state, but if we alwaysThe Middle from Beginning to End 293Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 293"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"stop our session when we feel dull, distracted, or weary, this will not inspire usto return to our practice. It will only create bad habits for our meditation.As a simple example to illustrate the process of analysis, let’s use meditating onimpermanence. After identifying an object to be analyzed for its impermanence,pick one of the many reasons that things are impermanent, such as that they areproduced by causes and conditions. This argument looks at the process of objectsarising through specific causes, their continuum being temporarily sustainedthrough certain conditions, and their consequent ceasing once these conditionsare no longer present. Assume the object chosen is an apple. Examine in a waythat is as concrete and detailed as possible how this reason for impermanenceapplies to the individual causes and conditions of this apple, such as an apple tree,water, earth, sunshine, minerals, and so on. Trace back the origins of these fac-tors themselves and find out how each one of them influences the arising, stay-ing, and ceasing of this apple. When you feel convinced that this reason forimpermanence applies to the apple, do not continue the analysis further. Ini-tially, you may have gained only a somewhat more vivid and comprehensive pic-ture of the many constantly changing factors that are involved in the appearanceof such a fruit. Then, just let your mind rest one-pointedly in this certainty—orthis wider picture of the apple’s presence—and absorb it for a while withoutreflecting on its impermanence or anything else. This provides the initial oppor-tunity for such an understanding to sink in to the deeper levels of your mind andthus create a much more powerful mental habit than just saying a few times,“This apple is impermanent.” After a while, resume your analysis—continuingwith either the same reason or another one—and thus repeat this shift from ana-lytical to resting meditation and back several times. To conclude, it is recom-mended that you end the session with a brief period of calm abiding and thenmake the dedication. In later sessions, you can successively apply the same orother reasons to many other objects, be they various outer things unrelated toyourself, personal possessions, friends, relatives, or your own body and mind.Obviously, this process of alternating analytical meditation and resting med-itation has to be repeated many times in order to truly affect our strong tenden-cies to see things as really existent, lasting, and unchanging. The purpose of allthis could be said to be “reprogramming our mental habitual patterns. Such iseffected by gradually replacing concepts that are not in accord with basic reality—and thus produce suffering—with stronger tendencies of progressively refinedconcepts, finally leading to a direct experience of reality that relinquishes suffer-ing. As the contemporary Kagyü master Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpochesays, Buddhism is a system of increasingly subtle concepts that counteract rela-tively coarser concepts. However, this should certainly not be misunderstood tomean that we try to brainwash ourselves or make something up in our analyticalmeditation. It is not that we “make” things empty through our concepts or analy-294The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 294"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"ses. Being empty is just their nature, whether we analyze them or not. Throughthe analytical approach, we proceed toward realizing for ourselves how thingsreally are. If we do not apply essential Buddhist notions to the deeply ingrainedhabitual tendencies of our belief systems and only work with them on a superfi-cial intellectual level, the teachings will be merely words without a deeper impacton our experiential world. As it is said, mind and dharma will not blend into one.This is especially important with such key Buddhist topics as emptiness, per-sonal identitylessness, and phenomenal identitylessness, since it is precisely theinstinctive assumption of a personal self and really existent phenomena that gov-erns our experience and actions. To address these topics and make them person-ally relevant to our life cannot be accomplished without some degree of personalinvestigation, which entails honestly looking into our own view of the world andbeing willing to revise it.AtıŸa’s Centrist Pith Instructions, Called The Open Jewel Caskethighlights theessential points of the entire process:One may wonder, “From where did all of this come in the first place,and to where does it depart now?” Once examined in this way, [onesees that] it neither comes from anywhere nor departs to anywhere. Allinner and outer phenomena are just like that. Therefore, everything isthe illusory magical display of one’s own mind. It is appearing yetdelusive, and delusive while appearing. Thus, all of it is contained inthe body, and the [body] is again contained in the mind. As for themind, it has no color and no shape. It is natural luminosity that is pri-mordially unborn. The very knowledge that discriminates this is alsoluminosity. In this interval, consciousness is nothing whatsoever, doesnot abide as anything, is not established as anything, and has not arisenas any aspect, and all discursiveness without exception is completely atpeace. This meditative concentration of space-vajra that is withoutappearance and in which the entire dust of characteristics has vanishedis like the very center of the sky that is lit up by the autumn sun. In it,dwell as long as possible.668The Progressive Stages of Meditation on EmptinessThe systematic, gradual succession of meditations that deal with personal andphenomenal identitylessness is often called the progressive stages of meditationon emptiness.669These stages are briefly outlined in the sÒtras and furtherexplained in Centrist texts such as N›g›rjuna’s Commentary on the Mind ofEnlightenmentand his Stages of Meditation,670Bh›vaviveka’s Jewel Lamp of Cen-trism, Jñ›nagarbha’s Path of Yoga Meditation, KamalaŸıla’s Stages of MeditationThe Middle from Beginning to End 295Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 295"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"and Entrance into Yoga Meditation, AtıŸa’s two Centrist Pith Instructions,Jñ›nakırti’s Instructions on the Stages of Meditation of the Vehicle of PerfectionsandEntrance into True Reality,671and Vimalamitra’s Topics of Gradualist Meditation.672From among these, KamalaŸıla’s three-volume Stages of Meditationgives by far themost detailed instructions. This text also calls the meditative progression “thestages of prajñ› meditation.”To illustrate this gradual progression, N›g›rjuna begins his Commentary on theMind of Enlightenment673by saying that bodhisattvas, after having generated theaspiring mind of enlightenment, should generate the ultimate mind of enlight-enment through the power of meditation. Thus, he commits to explaining themeditation on this mind of enlightenment that destroys cyclic existence. Theactual progression of this meditation starts with analyzing for the lack of a realpersonal identity. The reason to start with negating personal identity is that it rep-resents the object of a coarser level of clinging to real existence than the clingingto a real identity of all phenomena. Accordingly, N›g›rjuna first shows that thereis no personal self within the five aggregates, the twelve sources, and the eight-een constituents.Next, N›g›rjuna turns to phenomenal identitylessness. He negates the possi-bility of infinitesimal material particles—as asserted by various non-Buddhistschools as well as the Buddhist Followers of the Great Exposition and the SÒtraFollowers—by showing that such particles can be broken up infinitely withoutany remaining indivisible core ever being found. As a consequence, N›g›rjunastates that whatever appears and is experienced is nothing but an appearance inone’s own mind and that there are thus no outer material objects that are estab-lished as something other than or independent of mind. His text says:As the entities of apprehender and apprehended,The appearances of consciousnessDo not exist as outer objectsThat are different from consciousness.Therefore, in the sense of having the nature of entities,In any case, outer objects do not exist.It is these distinct appearances of consciousnessThat appear as the aspect of form.Just as people with dull mindsSee illusions, mirages,And the cities of scent-eaters,So do form and such appear.674296The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 296"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"N›g›rjuna further emphasizes that the reason the Buddha taught the aggre-gates, sources, and constituents was solely to negate a personal self and not toestablish what is contained within these aggregates and so on as really existingentities. The text continues:The teachings on the aggregates, constituents, and so onAre for the purpose of stopping the clinging to a self.By settling in mere mind,The greatly blessed ones let go of these too.675In the above four verses, N›g›rjuna clearly presents the intermediate step ofrealizing that all appearances occur solely within one’s own mind as the expres-sions of this mind. However, just like all other Centrists, he does not stop at thatpoint but—as the following verses and all his other texts show—negates the realexistence of the mind as well. Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrismalso mentionsthis step as a help for those who do not immediately see that, just as all otherappearances, the mind as their experiencer is empty too:The Buddhas said, “If there are no knowable objects,One easily finds that a knower is excluded.”If knowable objects do not exist, the negation of a knower is established.Therefore, they first negated knowable objects.676Thus, in terms of the view, Centrists make sure to refute all philosophical sys-tems that assert any kind of truly established mind. At the same time, in the con-text of the progression of an individual’s personal meditation and realization ofemptiness on the path, the intermediate step of seeing that, just as in a dream, allappearances are nothing but mental images is considered crucial, for it elimi-nates the clinging to a solid and really existing material world that “leads a life ofits own” apart from our perceiving mind. According to Centrists, the main rea-son the Buddha taught the three realms to be “mere mind” was in order to refuteany kind of creator or agent that creates the world. Rather, everything in cyclicexistence appears as the result of the karmic actions that originate and are expe-rienced within the minds of individual sentient beings. Another reason for theexpedient teachings on mere mind is to temporarily calm people’s fear of thecomplete emptiness of all phenomena without any reference point to hold on to.As N›g›rjuna says:The teaching of the Sage that“All of these are mere mind”The Middle from Beginning to End 297Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 297"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Is for the sake of removing the fear of naïve beingsAnd not [meant] in terms of true reality.677The third step in N›g›rjuna’s analysis is that mind itself is also unarisen, with-out nature, and empty. He describes what this emptiness means and why theexample of space is used to illustrate it.It is without characteristics and unarisen,Not existent, and free from the ways of speech.Space, the mind of enlightenment,And enlightenment have the characteristic of not being two.678In his Exposition of The Commentary on the Mind of Enlightenment, the FourthShamarpa Chökyi Tragba679(1453–1524) explains this emptiness of mind. Hestarts by quoting the Indian master Sm ̧ti’s commentary on N›g›rjuna’s text:Our own mind is primordially unarisen.It has the nature of emptiness.and continues:This meaning of Madhyamaka in our own [Buddhist] system—as it isexpressed in the lines [of N›g›rjuna’s verse 46]—is extensively taught.[Madhyamaka or emptiness] means being without characteristics thatdefine true reality. It [means] to be unarisen, since it is neither existentnor nonexistent. It is neither something existent that has already arisennor something nonexistent that is not suitable to arise. It is free frombeing demonstrable through words and expressions by the [various]ways of speech. This [emptiness] has the characteristic that space as itssuitable example, nonconceptual wisdom (the mind of enlighten-ment), and enlightenment that clearly realizes all phenomena in anunmistaken way are not two [that is, not different]. The meaning ofthis is as follows: Conventionally, space exists, but ultimately it isunobservable. Likewise, enlightenment exists on the seeming level, butultimately it does not exist. Also the nonconceptual mind of enlight-enment can be expressed in conventional terms, but it is withoutnature when analyzed. Therefore, the characteristics of these [three] arenot different.680Fourth, N›g›rjuna presents the defining characteristics of the proper medita-tion on emptiness and identifies three ways of misunderstanding emptiness.298The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 298"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"The emptiness that is called “nonarising,”“Emptiness,” and “identitylessness”Is what inferior beings meditate on.It is not the meditation on the [actual emptiness].What has the characteristic of the streamOf positive and negative thoughts being cut offThe Buddhas taught to be emptiness.The other [emptinesses] they did not declare to be emptiness.To abide without observing the mindIs the characteristic of space.Their meditation on emptinessIs declared to be space meditation.681Chökyi Tragba comments:One may wonder, “Is there a difference between being skilled andbeing unskilled in the way of meditating on emptiness?” [These verses]teach that there is a difference. [The three emptinesses as misunder-stood by inferior beings] are the [kind of] emptiness that [merely] rep-resents the lack of reality. They are called [1] “nonarising” of allphenomena, these being like sky-flowers,[2] “Emptiness” that is a nonimplicative negation,And [3] “identitylessness” even on the conventional level.682Inferior beings are those of weak insight, which is to say those withoutmuch study or beginners who have not trained in knowledge. The empti-ness in the sense of extinction on which they meditate in these [three]ways is not the meditation on this [actual] emptiness of true reality. . . .Positivity means to abandon killing and such. Negativity means toengage in the karma of putting [others] down and so on. Or, positivity[can refer to] sharp knowledge that analyzes conceptuality, while neg-ativity is its opposite, ignorance. [However, all] such thoughts are [justvarious forms of] clinging to characteristics in terms of the factors tobe relinquished and their remedies. Only [the meditation on empti-ness] that is characterized by the stream of [these thoughts] being cutoff is what the Buddhas taught to be the supreme nonconceptual med-itation on emptiness.

Hence, the proper meditation of yogic practition-ers on emptiness is declared to be the meditation that is nonconceptuallike space. . . . This meditation that is praised by noble N›g›rjuna insuch a way is proclaimed by some earlier and later Tibetans to be themeditation of the Chinese Hvashang. However, in this treatise,[N›g›rjuna] takes it to be the style of the great bodhisattvas.683To summarize this quote, meditation on emptiness is mistaken when empti-ness is misunderstood as (1) absolute nonexistence (such as the nonexistence of asky-flower), (2) a mere nonimplicative negation, or (3) total identitylessness orutter nonexistence of things even on the conventional level.Fifth, N›g›rjuna states that both cyclic existence (ignorance) and liberation(realization of true reality) occur within and depend on our mind. Thus, themeditation and realization of emptiness is not spacelike in the sense of a blanknothingness, but it is an open, nonreferential state of mind that is at the sametime profoundly peaceful and blissful.The seeming comes from afflictions and karma.Karma originates from the mind.The mind is constituted by latent tendencies.Freedom from latent tendencies is bliss.This blissful mind is peacefulness.A peaceful mind will not be ignorant.Not to be ignorant is the realization of true reality.The realization of true reality is the attainment of liberation.684KamalaŸıla’s Stages of Meditationpresents the exact same progression of med-itation on emptiness but in a much more detailed way. The meditation likewisestarts with personal identitylessness and then proceeds to phenomenal identity-lessness. As a sÒtra source for these stages of meditation, KamalaŸıla quotes threecrucial verses from The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºkafor a brief overview andthen explains them in detail:By relying on mere mind,One does not imagine outer objects.300The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 300"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"By resting in the observed object of suchness,One should go beyond mere mind too.Going beyond mere mind,One must even go beyond the nonappearance [of apprehender and apprehended].The yogic practitioner who rests in nonappearanceSees the great vehicle.This spontaneously present, peaceful restingIs completely purified through aspiration prayers.Genuine identityless wisdomSees by way of nonappearance.685The meaning of this is as follows: First, yogic practitioners should ana-lyze phenomena with form that are imputed by others as outer objects,such as visible forms. “Is it that these are something other than con-sciousness, or is it consciousness itself that appears in this way? Is thisjust like in a dream?” Thus, they investigate infinitesimal particlesexternal to consciousness. When these infinitesimal particles are exam-ined as to their parts, yogic practitioners do not see such [outer]objects. Since they do not see them, they reflect, “All of these are meremind, while outer objects do not exist.” Thus, it has been said above:By relying on mere mind,One does not imagine outer objects.This refers to relinquishing conceptions about phenomena that haveform. For when one analyzes what [first seems to] possess the charac-teristic of being suitable to be observed, it is not observable. After onehas investigated phenomena that have form, those that have no formshould be investigated. Here, “mere mind” means that when there isnothing apprehended, an apprehender is not reasonable [either],because an apprehender depends on something apprehended. There-fore, the conclusion is that mind is devoid of something apprehendedand an apprehender and is just without this pair [or nondual in thissense]. This is the characteristic of nonduality [on this level]. By rest-ing in the observed object of suchness, you should go beyond meremind too. Go far beyond [any] aspect of an apprehender and thus restin the nonappearance of this pair [of apprehender and apprehended],that is, in consciousness without these two.

Since it is not justified that entities arise from them-selves or something other, apprehender and apprehended are nothingbut delusive. Since such a [consciousness without apprehender andapprehended] does not exist apart from these two, it is also not real.Having examined [in this way], also abandon reification with respectto such a consciousness without this pair. This means that you shouldsolely rest in the wisdom that is without [even] the appearance of non-dual wisdom. In other words, rest in the realization that all phenom-ena are without nature. Through [your] resting in this [realization],supreme true actuality and thereby nonconceptual meditative con-centration are entered.At the point when yogic practitioners rest within the wisdom that iswithout the appearance of nondual wisdom, they dwell on the path ofseeing. Therefore, they see the great vehicle. Seeing genuine true real-ity is called the great vehicle. As for the seeing of genuine true reality,it is the very fact that there is nothing to be seen, when the light of per-fect wisdom dawns through the examination of all phenomena withthe eye of supreme knowledge. This is also expressed in the sÒtras:One may wonder, “What is seeing the ultimate?” It means thatall phenomena are not seen. Here, [the Buddha] talked about “not seeing” by having in mind thatthere is no such seeing [of any phenomenon]. However, this “not see-ing” is not like not seeing when the conditions [for seeing] are incom-plete (such as in a blind person and when closing one’s eyes) or whenone does not mentally engage [in seeing]. . . . It is through thissequence of meditation that one should meditate on the true reality [ofall phenomena].686These successive stages of Centrist meditation on emptiness represent the basicstructure of KamalaŸıla’s entire text. The major portions of his work consist ofdetailed elaborations on the various aspects of the above progression. AtıŸa’s Cen-trist Pith Instructionsagrees on the same outline:Entities are of two kinds: those that possess form and those that arewithout form. Those that possess form are collections of infinitesimalparticles. When these are analyzed and broken up in terms of theirdirectional parts, not even their minutest [part] remains and they are302The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 302"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"without any shape. Since they are just like space, they are not estab-lished. Or, they are free from unity and multiplicity. Thus, they arewithout color and utterly without appearance.What is without form is the mind.

As for the present mind, it is also difficult to examine:It has no color and is without any shape. Since it is just like space, itis not established. Or, when analyzed and scrutinized with the weaponof reasoning, it is free from unity and multiplicity. In other words, itis unarisen. Or, [it may be said that] it is natural luminosity and so on.Therefore, one realizes that it is not established.At the point when these two [what possesses form and what is with-out form] definitely do not exist and are not established as [having] anynature whatsoever, the very knowledge that discriminates them is notestablished either. . . . once all specifically characterized and generallycharacterized phenomena are established as nonexistent [throughknowledge], this knowledge itself is without appearance, luminous,and not established as [having] any nature whatsoever. . . . For as longas neither characteristics nor the enemies and robbers of thoughts arise,consciousness should rest in such a [state]. When wishing to rise [fromthe meditation], slowly open the cross-legged position and stand up.Then, in an illusionlike frame of mind, perform as much positivitywith body, speech, and mind as possible.687These stages of meditation on emptiness by N›g›rjuna, KamalaŸıla, and AtıŸaare presented here in detail to clearly put forth the standard outline of the Cen-trist approach to such meditation. In addition, the way in which these mastersunfold this progression shows a clear continuity in what is known as the progres-sive stages of meditation on emptiness as they are explained in the Kagyü lineage.The Kagyü version of such meditation on emptiness, as presented by KhenpoTsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, names the above stages after certain Buddhistphilosophical systems as they are presented in Tibetan Buddhism. His book Pro-gressive Stages of Meditation on Emptinesslists the following five stages:1) the hearers6882) Cittam›tra3) Sv›tantrika4) Pr›saºgika5) Shentong-MadhyamakaThe Middle from Beginning to End 303Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 303"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"These correspond respectively to meditating on1) personal identitylessness2) mere mind without the duality of an internal subject and external objects3) emptiness as a spacelike nonimplicative negation4) emptiness as utter freedom from discursiveness5) emptiness and luminosity inseparableAs the book says at the outset, these stages are given the names of these schools,but in terms of actually practicing such analytical meditations, the point is not toascertain these schools’ precise positions nor to look for the exact historical andphilosophical correspondences between these five stages and the views of the schoolswhose names they bear. The presentation of these stages is meant to be under-stood as a pedagogical model for the progression of the personal insights of a prac-titioner who meditates on emptiness. This is, for example, evident from manyAutonomist texts in general and the quotes from The Stages of Meditationabove,in which the Autonomists themselves say that the notion of emptiness as a merenonimplicative negation has to be left behind. Moreover, Autonomists also empha-size the freedom from discursiveness and its inseparability from luminosity.689So the crucial point here—and this cannot be overemphasized—is that thefocus of this progressive meditation is not at all on what various people or schoolssay or think but on the development of experience and realization in the mindsof individuals who are actually engaging in such meditation. Thus, these stagesrepresent a succession from a coarse understanding to increasingly subtle andrefined insights that culminate in the direct seeing of emptiness or true reality.Except for a few especially gifted persons, most people cannot immediatelygrasp—let alone fully realize—the more subtle aspects of the teachings on empti-ness. Rather, they have to take a gradual approach by starting with the most fun-damental issues and then proceeding to the subtle points, just as physicians donot start their careers by performing open-heart surgery but first study theanatomical and physiological basics. All the details of the very subtle states ofmind during the more advanced stages of meditation on emptiness are not likelyto be understood if we have not gone through the basic levels of this process. Inother words, in order to be able to tackle our subtle mental obscurations and tosee the true nature of our mind, we have to start with its coarser obscurations.Otherwise, we would not even be aware that we have these subtle obscurations,just as a person whose entire body is in severe pain due to cancer is not aware ofa minor twinge that is caused by a little scratch on the back.This progressive approach can also be compared to a treasure hunt. If we aretold about a treasure somewhere under a finger-shaped rock in a remote place,we first have to get a large-scale map that shows us how to get to the area wherethis treasure lies. Then we need a small-scale map of that area. Eventually, hav-304The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 304"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"ing arrived in the area in question, we have to find this particular fingerlike rockwith our own eyes, dig up the treasure with our own hands, and enjoy its beautywith our own senses. In the same way, we are gradually guided toward the real-ization of emptiness, but in the end the true nature of our mind can be seen bynothing but this mind itself.Since a number of books provide detailed instructions on how to proceedthrough these progressive stages of meditation, I will offer just a few practicalremarks here.690The above five stages as they are outlined in all the texts men-tioned simply sketch the gradual dwindling of all our reference points in termsof personal and phenomenal kinds of real identity. This is just another way of say-ing that emptiness is initially understood on increasingly subtle, conceptual lev-els and finally directly realized.The first step—the meditation on personal identitylessness, or looking for a selfin relation to our five aggregates—can basically have two approaches. First, wemay compare all the various parts of our five aggregates with what we sponta-neously or experientially feel our self to be. We simply ask ourselves questionssuch as: Is my body my self? Is my head my self? Do I think that my mind is myself? Are my emotions my self? Are they controlled by my self? If so, how? Formany of these questions, our spontaneous answer will be no. For example, dur-ing analysis, we do not feel that our self is limited to only our body or any of itsparts. This simply is not our experience of “me.” However, when it comes tomind, emotions, and so on, the answer might not be that straightforward. Whennot sure, we should analyze further. We could ask: If our mind is our self, howexactly is that so? Is it our entire mind or just parts of it? Does this correspondto our experience of “me” in all situations?691By going deeper with our analysis,sooner or later we will inevitably hit the crucial question that actually shouldhave been posed at the beginning of our search: What exactly is my self?This leads us to the second, more systematic and thorough approach of inves-tigation. In general, to compare two things, we must know what each of themis. We cannot really compare the five aggregates with our self if we do not knowwhat this self is. So the next step is to try to define or describe our self. This pro -cess in itself is already very illuminating in terms of whether the self exists or not,since—apart from a definite “feeling” that we have a self—most people have avery hard time coming up with an exact description of what it might be. Para-doxically, one of the major reasons we are convinced that we have a self is thatwe don’t actually know what it is or what it looks like. Since our sense of hav-ing a self is so vague, it is open to almost any kind of projection or identifica-tion. In fact, we constantly shift the objects on which we build this idea of a self.Sometimes we relate it more to our body, sometimes more to our thoughts,sometimes to our emotions, sometimes to our career, and so on. We tend to saysuch things as “I am sick,” “My head hurts,” “I am a doctor,” “I quit being a doc-The Middle from Beginning to End 305Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 305"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"tor,” “I think,” “There are too many thoughts in my mind,” “I am sad,” or “Myde pression has worsened.” All of these statements expose a variety of differentways of assuming and relating to an underlying self, yet we usually do not seethe contradictions. Therefore, it is easy to take the existence of some underly-ing true “I” somewhere in our five aggregates for granted and to constantly referto itAs was said earlier, in Buddhism in general, a personal self is described as some-thing that is single, lasting, and independent or in control. These are very gen-eral features that for most people apply to their sense of self. Usually, we thinkthat we have a single self and not multiple selves; that this self has a lasting qual-ity and does not constantly change; and that we are—more or less at least—incontrol of or independent in what we think and do. However, when doing theactual analysis here, it is very important to try to come up with our own descrip-tion or definition that applies to our personal sense of self and corresponds to ouractual experience of “me.” Otherwise, we are just comparing our five aggregateswith some vague general notion of self that has little to do with how we experi-ence our own self in everyday life. Once we have found such a description—even if it is not completely satisfying—we should then see whether something canbe found in our five aggregates that matches this identification of our self. To dothis in a systematic way, we can use the sevenfold reasoning of a chariot that wasexplained earlier.We may compare this analysis to searching a house for a lost car key. First, wehave to know what this key looks like—otherwise, what are we looking for? Weare not looking for just any key. We also have to know how many rooms thehouse has and where they are, including the basement and the attic. Then we cansystematically go through each room, open all the closets and drawers, look underthe beds, and so on. Once we are sure that this key is not in one room, we go onto the next. Finally, when we have not found it any place, we have to concludethat there is no such key in the house. As we probably all know, when searchingfor something, we sometimes remain unsure and think, “It must be here some-where.” Then we go back and repeat our search even more thoroughly. This mayhappen several times before we finally have no doubt that there is no key, sincewe have turned the whole house upside down. In a similar way, when we look forour self, we have to know what we are looking for, and we must clearly identifythe places in which we are looking for it, that is, our five aggregates. If we do notsearch in every corner of them, or if we still have doubts as to whether there issomething that corresponds to our individual notion of a self, we have to repeatour analysis until we are absolutely sure that there is no such self in our aggregates.If we still think there must be some self, we can go back and repeat the samesearch with an alternative description of what this self might be. In this way, wehave to go through this process again and again until we never again experience306The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 306"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"the slightest doubt that there is no personal self of any kind. This then is therealization of personal identitylessness.The discussion up to this point has concerned the first step of the progressivestages of meditation on emptiness, the stage of the hearers who investigate thelack of a personal self. Now, from the second step (Cittam›tra) onward, we dealonly with phenomenal identitylessness. This second step of “mere mind” basicallysays that all our experiences, whatever they and their objects may look like, do notoccur anywhere other than within our mind. In other words, both the appre-hending subject and the apprehended object are of a mental nature. The analy-sis here involves two parts:1) Through analysis, the existence of outer objects as anything other than men-tal experiences is negated.2) The meditator rests in nondual experience without subject and object.The first step—negating outer objects—is approached from three sides:1) breaking them down into infinitely smaller pieces2) analyzing the object and our perception of it on a causal time line3) seeing the subjectivity of every appearance and experienceThe issue of whether there are any really existing outer objects can be analyzedthrough an approach very similar to that of modern physics: by breaking up theseobjects into smaller and smaller parts without finding any indivisible core. Ifthere are no identifiable external objects, we must conclude that what we experi-ence as outer objects is nothing but a projection in our mind, just as in a dream,in which we also seem to experience outer objects while clearly there are none.Second, the analysis focuses on whether there is any causal relation betweenobjects and our perception of them. We consider that, in terms of our personalperception, we can only speak about the existence of an object once we perceiveit. As long as we do not perceive it, we have no way of directly knowing whetherthere is such an object. Thus, it is obvious that what we call an object and the sub-jective consciousness that is aware of this object occur simultaneously. However,if there were outer objects that exist external to our mind and serve as the causesfor our perception of them, they would have to exist before the perceptions thatare their results. For, causes must precede their results in time and must alsocease before the arising of these results. But if these outer objects existed beforeour perception of them, what would we perceive, since they are already gone atthe time of this perception? This is the background for one of the two major rea-sonings that are used in this context of denying outer objects, which is called“the invariable co-observation”692of appearances and mind. The Middle from Beginning to End 307Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 307"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"The third approach focuses on the subjectivity of perception. If we considerwhat exactly we know of objects, then we see that every perception is only a sub-jective experience in our mind as the perceiver. If we touch or smell a rose, “itssoftness” or “its fragrance” is nothing but our mental experience of softness or fra-grance. This accords well with what modern science says: that there is no otheror “objective” softness and fragrance apart from what we subjectively experience.It is this fact that is expressed by the second major reasoning concerning thenonexistence of outer objects, which is called “invariable sameness of appear-ances and mind as the nature of mere lucidity.”693It says that there are no objectsoutside of the mind, because all our perceptions and what they perceive are alikein that they are nothing but immaterial clear appearances in our mind. In otherwords, objects are not different from the cognizing consciousness because of thevery fact of being cognized. The reason is that consciousness—lucid awarenessthat neither consists of particles nor has spatial extension—can only cognize whathas the same nature as consciousness, but not some material objects that have analtogether different nature (that is, lacking cognizance, consisting of particles,and possessing spatial dimensions). Consequently, objects in a dream and in thewaking state are not fundamentally different. Both seem to perform their func-tions in their respective contexts, but in actual fact, none of them is really exis-tent as something separate from our experience. This is not to deny that theobjects of our perceptions appear to us as if they existed externally. However,apart from the fact that it subjectively appears this way, there is no evidence thatthere really are external objects in any way other than what appears as such objectsin the mind. The relatively greater stability and regularity of daytime appear-ances in comparison to, for example, appearances in a dream, is said to be expe-rienced only because of comparatively more stable and regular patterns ofhabitual tendencies for such appearances in our minds.In the second part of the stage of “mere mind,” the meditator rests in the non-dual experience of the lack of subject and object. If there are no really existentobjects, neither is there a really existent corresponding subject that perceivesthem. However, since our mind is not just nothing but is full of experiences,clarity, and movement, the meditation and realization of this step is said to beresting in bare mental experience without the duality of subject and object.The third step in the progressive stages of meditation on emptiness is namedafter the Autonomists and refers to emptiness as a spacelike nonimplicative nega-tion. Even if we realize that there are neither really existent outer objects norsubjects to perceive them, there is still the subtle clinging to the reality of our meremental experience free from perceiver and perceived. Therefore, through the fivegreat Centrist reasonings and such, we proceed to the stage of seeing that thislucid momentary experience too is empty of an intrinsic nature. Thus, startingwith our self, we find neither any material objects nor mental subjects nor a bare308The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 308"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"experience free from duality. This nonfinding of all phenomena, or the absenceof an inherent real nature of all phenomena—a nonimplicative negation—is thenthe object of our meditation in the third stage.The fourth step in the progressive stages of meditation on emptiness is calledthe stage of Consequentialists and presents emptiness as utter freedom from dis-cursiveness. As was explained, any nonimplicative negation is still a conceptualobject and thus a reference point. So even the nonimplicative negation of empti-ness in the sense of the mere absence of a real nature, nonarising, and such (as inthe third step) is still a subtle reference point. In order for our mind to be ableto fully relax within the space of the expanse of dharmas free from center or edge,it has to let go of even its most subtle grasping at any reference point includingthe freedom from reference points. This is the space of the actual freedom fromall discursiveness that we allow for during the fourth step.The fifth step in the progressive stages of meditation on emptiness is namedafter Shentong-Madhyamaka and presents emptiness as inseparable from mind’sluminosity. Since the very freedom from discursiveness and reference pointsdescribed in the last step is not just some blank space or mere absence (whichwould be the extreme of extinction or nihilism), it is also described as luminos-ity, or the unity of wisdom and expanse. Hence, in terms of the actual nature ofmind, the fifth stage is not really an additional or higher stage above the freedomfrom discursiveness. As Sakya Pa ̊ ̃ita says in his Distinction of the Three Vows,the very attempt to go higher or beyond the freedom from all reference pointswould just mean to fall out of nonreferentiality by inevitably creating a referencepoint again.694Thus, the fourth and fifth stages indicate the two aspects of thenature of our mind, which is the undifferentiable unity of the freedom from dis-cursiveness and luminosity. Moonbeams of Mah›mudr›also highlights the even-tual experiential unity of the last two steps:There are many ways in which mind is similar to space, but here thisrefers to the following: When one analyzes through discriminatingknowledge, finally, also the very [process of] discrimination subsides,upon which [the mind] becomes pure as [a state of] nonconceptuality,just as seeing ceases through looking at space. As Tilopa says:For example, through looking at space, seeing will cease.Likewise, when mind is looking at mind,The collection of thoughts ceases and unsurpassable enlightenment is attained . . .695First, one analyzes [the mind] through discriminating knowledge. It isexplained that, through this, the very [process of] discrimation itselfThe Middle from Beginning to End 309Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 309"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"subsides, upon which nonconceptual wisdom dawns. You may thenwonder whether there is some difference between mind and space.Yes, there is, since space is not a cognition that personally experiencesitself. When mind is realized, this in itself is explained to be personallyexperienced wisdom.696In summary, we could outline the progression of our experiences and realiza-tions while meditating on emptiness in this way as follows. We start with themeditation and realization of personal identitylessness. Then, in terms of phe-nomenal identitylessness, we proceed from the coarse notion of real outer objectsvia the more subtle notions of mere nondual mental experience and emptiness asa nonimplicative negation all the way up—or rather back—to just letting ourmind be in its natural state of nonreferential freedom, unconditionally aware ofits own radiant display.Mental Nonengagement in MeditationOne of the main issues in the well-known debate at Samye, where the Indianmaster KamalaŸıla is said to have defeated his Chinese opponent HvashangMah›y›na, was whether meditation on the ultimate is to be understood as justletting the mind settle in a state that is completely without any thought or focusor whether analysis and some focus are required. This is related to the questionof whether progress on the path is gradual or instantaneous. Since that time, thedesignation “Hvashang meditation” has become Tibetan shorthand for an exclu-sive cultivation of a thought-free mental state as representing the realization of theultimate. It goes along with a complete rejection of the aspect of means, such asthe accumulation of merit and proper ethical conduct. It was after this debate thatKamalaŸıla wrote his Stages of Meditationin order to clarify such issues by estab-lishing the gradualist approach and describing in detail how to train in medita-tion on emptiness. Despite the different accounts of what the view of the Chinesemaster Hvashang really was and what exactly happened during the debate atSamye, all of its issues continued to be major points of controversy between thedifferent schools of Tibetan Buddhism.697One of the key terms in the context of how to properly cultivate meditationon emptiness is what is called “mental nonengagement.” Pawo Rinpoche sum-marizes the correct understanding of mental nonengagement:Its meaning is to rest one-pointedly on the focal object [of medita-tion], without being distracted by other thoughts. If this [one-pointedresting] were stopped, all meditative concentrations would stop. There-fore, in general, “mental nonengagement” has the meaning of not310The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 310"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"mentally engaging in any object other than the very focus of the[respective] meditative concentration. In particular, when focusing onthe ultimate, [mental nonengagement] has the meaning of letting [themind] be without even apprehending this “ultimate.” However, thisshould not be understood as being similar to having fallen asleep.698Since this term is also frequently used in the Mah›mudr› and Dzogchen teach-ings, other schools mistakenly equate the correct notion of mental nonengage-ment with the stereotypic Hvashang meditation and thus deprecate the meditationstyles of these two systems as being just some mindless state of spacing out.More important, though, the notion of mental nonengagement, or mentaldisengagement, is intimately connected to the relationship between analyticaland resting meditation as discussed above. Ultimately, mental nonengagementindicates nothing but the subjective side of what is called freedom from discur-siveness. In other words, the only way in which the mind can truly engage in this“object” that is the absence of any object or reference point is precisely by notengaging in any object, that is, not creating any reference points. The absence ofreference points can only be realized by a nonreferential mind, since this is theonly perceptual mode that exactly corresponds to it. That this is not an inventionby later schools or a mistaken approach to meditation is clearly demonstrated bynumerous passages in the sÒtras. For example, The SÒtra Requested by Ocean ofIntelligent Insight699states:Do not mentally engage in phenomena.Completely abandon doing anything further.Realize all phenomenaAs equality in true reality.What is taught is the application of mindfulnessWithout mindfulness or something to be mentally engaged.The Prajñ›p›ramit› SÒtra in Eight Thousand Linesagrees:This meditation on the perfection of knowledge means not meditat-ing on any phenomenon.700AtıŸa’s autocommentary onThe Lamp for the Path to EnlightenmentquotesN›g›rjuna:Not imagined by imagination,Mind completely nonabiding,The Middle from Beginning to End 311Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 311"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"No mindfulness, no mental engagement,To nonreferentiality I prostrate.701Similar quotes from Indian Centrist texts were presented in the discussion ofanalytical meditation and resting meditation.It is noteworthy in this context that KamalaŸıla as the generally accepted win-ner of the Samye debate addresses the issue of mental nonengagement in greatdetail in his Stages of Meditationand—more briefly—in his commentary on TheDh›ra ̊ı of Entering Nonconceptuality.702He underlines the distinction betweenmental nonengagement and the absence of mental engagement. The first isunderstood as the fundamental noninvolvement in dualistic appearances whilesustaining fresh wakefulness, once discriminating knowledge has determined thatthere are no dualistic phenomena whatsoever. This can also be understood asmental disengagement in the sense of not interfering with the nature of the mindas it is. On the other hand, absence of mental engagement describes the mereabsence of any mental activity, such as in a faint, deep sleep, or mental stupor,which does not lead to any realization or liberation at all. Thus, KamalaŸılaemphasizes that the first is a crucial factor in meditation, while the latter is obvi-ously to be avoided.This might shed a different light on the debate of Samye and how it was usedpolemically against systems such as Mah›mudr› and Dzogchen. Especially, theclaim that mental nonengagement is equivalent to Hvashang meditation is seento be completely absurd, since even KamalaŸıla, the very master who is acceptedby all Tibetan schools as the one who defeated Hvashang, greatly advocates men-tal nonengagement. Otherwise, it would absurdly follow that KamalaŸıla himselfwas a proponent of Hvashang’s infamous style of meditation and that he hadrefuted his own view in debate. And on what grounds would he later have writ-ten an extensive treatise that justifies this very view in detail? Thus, at least interms of meditation practice proper, the issue in the Samye debate seems to havebeen more one of mental nonengagement versus absence of mental engagementaltogether, rather than one of analysis and accumulation of merit versus meretrancelike meditation. In detail, in the first volume of his Stages of Meditation,KamalaŸıla quotes The Dh›ra ̊ı of Entering Nonconceptuality703and explains:Through mental nonengagement, the characteristics of form andso on are relinquished.What [the Buddha] had in mind when he said this was that [in med-itation] one does not mentally engage in what is not observable onceit has been examined through knowledge. However, this does not referto a mere absence of mental engagement. As exemplified by such312The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 312"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"[mental states] as the meditative absorption without discrimination,the beginningless clinging to forms and such is not relinquishedthrough merely relinquishing mental engagement in it. Without hav-ing relinquished doubts, one is not able to relinquish the mentalengagement in clinging to previously observed forms and such, just asit is not possible to eliminate the heat [of a fire] without eliminatingthe fire. Thus, it is not possible to expel these conceptions about formsand such from the mind as if removing a thorn from it with one’shands, because the seeds of doubt must be relinquished.As for these seeds of doubt, when yogic practitioners examine [formsand such] through their eye of supreme knowledge and in the light thatsprings forth from their meditative concentration, previously observedobjects such as forms that [seemed to] have the characteristic of beingsuitable to be observed are no longer observed. Therefore, they arerelinquished just like the notion that a rope is a snake, and not in anyother way. At this point, freed from the seeds of doubt, one is able torelinquish mental engagement in the characteristics of forms and such,but not in any other way. Otherwise, if the light of the meditative con-centration of yogic practitioners does not shine and if they are notlooking with their eye of supreme knowledge, they do not removetheir doubts about the existence of forms and such. This is just like aperson in a dark [house] who has doubts about whether there are vasesand such in this house. . . . [On the other hand,] when such [exami-nation] has been performed, just as uprooted trees do not grow in theearth again, the mind that wrongly conceptualizes will not arise again,since it has no more root.704KamalaŸıla continues in the third volume of his text:Thus, to say, “Nothing whatsoever is to be thought” means to aban-don the supreme knowledge that has the characteristic of perfectly dis-criminating actual reality. Since perfect discrimination is the root ofperfect wisdom, its root is cut by abandoning this [discriminatingknowledge]. Hence, supramundane supreme knowledge is abandonedand without this, omniscience will also be rejected. . . .Without perfect discrimination, through which means should yogicpractitioners rest the mind within the state of nonconceptuality, whenthis mind is habituated to entities such as forms and clings to themsince beginningless time? Someone might say, “They engage [in thisThe Middle from Beginning to End 313Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 313"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"state] through the absence of attention705and the absence of mentalengagement with regard to all phenomena.” This is not appropriate.Without perfect discrimination, all experienced phenomena cannotbe rendered into something that is not mentally engaged in or to whichno attention is paid. People [may try to] meditate by thinking, “I shallnot pay attention to these [phenomena] and not mentally engage [inthem]” and thus [attempt to] meditate without paying attention ormentally engaging them. At that point, [however, it is precisely]through this [approach] that one will have paid a lot of attention tothem and will have very much mentally engaged in them.If the mere nonexistence of attention and mental engagement is takento be “nonattention” and “mental nonengagement,” it is to be ana-lyzed in what way these two [attention and mental engagement] arenonexistent. [Some utter] nonexistence is not suitable as a cause [foranything], so how could [plain] signlessness and [mere] nonexistenceof mental engagement become the state of nonconceptuality? If just this[nonexistence of attention and mental engagement] were sufficient tobe [true] nonconceptuality, this state of nonconceptuality could beentered even through fainting, since it is [a state] without attentionand mental engagement. Without perfect discrimination, there are noother means in any other way to bring about nonattention and men-tal nonengagement. And if there is [nothing but] nonattention andmental nonengagement, without perfect discrimination, how couldone engage in the lack of nature of all phenomena? Of course, the onlyway that phenomena actually are is that they are empty of nature. How-ever, without discrimination and [just] through the [lack of attentionand mental engagement], one will not realize this emptiness. Withoutthe realization of emptiness, the obscurations will not be relinquished.Otherwise, everybody would always be self-liberated. . . .Also, as long as yogic practitioners who evenly rest in meditative con-centration have a mental consciousness, this [consciousness] mustundoubtedly refer to something, [since] the consciousness of ordinarysentient beings does not abruptly become nonreferential. If they hadno [such referential consciousness at all], how would they realize thatphenomena are without nature? . . . Therefore, the arising of nonat-tention and mental nonengagement with regard to the genuinedharma should be regarded as something that is preceded by perfectdiscrimination. Why? Because it is through perfect discrimination thatone is able to bring about nonattention and mental nonengagement,314The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 314"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"and not in any other way. Thus, when yogic practitioners have exam-ined through perfect supreme knowledge, ultimately they do not seeany arisen phenomena whatsoever within the three times. At thispoint, how should they be attentive to and mentally engage in [any-thing]? Ultimately, since the three times do not exist, how can they beattentive to and mentally engage in the absence of experiencing them?Therefore, since all discursiveness is completely at peace, this is enter-ing nonconceptual wisdom. Having entered it, [yogic practitioners]realize emptiness. Through the realization of [emptiness], the entireweb of bad views is relinquished. . . .Thus, whenever one hears such words as “inconceivable” [in the Bud-dha’s teachings], they [are meant to] teach that phenomena are just theobject of personal experience in order to put an end to the pride ofthose who think that true reality [can be] realized through merelystudying and reflecting on it as being such and such. [Such words]should also be understood as negating improper reflection. However,they are not [taught as] a negation of perfect discrimination. Other-wise, as explained before, they would contradict a vast number of scrip-tures and reasonings. Moreover, what one must familiarize oneselfwith through the supreme knowledge that arises from meditation isnothing else but the very realization [that has been attained] throughthe [preceding] supreme knowledge that arises from studying andreflection, just as a horse runs on its familiar ground.706As was explained above, what is to be relinquished in meditation (reificationor clinging to real existence) and its remedy (discriminating knowledge) aremutually exclusive and cannot exist simultaneously. Therefore, the more reifica-tion is weakened through Centrist analysis, the more vividly the certainty aboutemptiness is experienced. Finally, such certainty does not need to be furtherenhanced through explicit analysis, since it has become a natural part of our mindthrough the power of having repeatedly nurtured it during the phases of restingmeditation. At this point, other than just resting with unwavering awarenessright within this very lucid presence of immediate certainty, there is no need todeliberately bring it to mind again and again.For example, as children, many of us believed in the real existence of SantaClaus here on earth, but at some point we started to develop doubts. We inves-tigated further, questioned our parents and friends, and finally discovered that theSanta Claus whom we saw at home every year was our uncle or even our father.Once we became absolutely sure there was no Santa Claus, we did not need toanalyze this fact any further or keep repeating to ourselves, “There is no SantaThe Middle from Beginning to End 315Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 315"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Claus, there is no Santa Claus.” Even if other people claimed the opposite, therewas no way we would change our minds. The existence of Santa Claus is simplyno longer an issue, since we have developed irreversible and natural certainty thathe does not exist, which leaves no room for any doubts. Thus, even when we tellour own children the same story later, in our own mind, the thought of a realSanta Claus never appears again.Contrary to the above presentation of mental nonengagement and noncon-ceptual meditation, Tsongkhapa holds that apprehending a mental image707ofemptiness is necessary, liberating, and not to be relinquished or negated. Thus,according to him, while sustaining the actual main phase of meditative equipoise,one must constantly bring clearly to mind the mode of apprehending emptinessas a nonimplicative negation.708In other words, the meditator is supposed to cre-ate a powerful awareness that apprehends phenomena’s emptiness of inherentexistence as the antidote to the clinging to their inherent existence. Tsongkhapaclaims that all meditations of superior insight that do not involve this mode ofapprehension are flawed.709However, since this approach necessarily involves conceptualizing the lack ofinherent existence or a real nature, it is not at all different from clinging to suchan emptiness—a nonimplicative negation—in a more or less subtle way. A mentalimage always entails some degree of apprehension or clinging. So, although theexistence of real identities is negated, the conceptual grasping at identitylessnessor emptiness still persists. Hence, this approach is limited to and cannot gobeyond cultivating an intellectually fabricated emptiness. In fact, the more pow-erful the apprehension of such an emptiness is, the more intense one’s graspingand clinging to a reference point becomes, rather than letting go of all referencepoints and—as The Dh›ra ̊ı of Entering Nonconceptualityand KamalaŸıla putit—entering the expanse of nonconceptuality. Thus, from the perspective of theultimate expanse of emptiness, to claim that the conceptual object of the nomi-nal ultimate—the absence of real existence by the negation of real existence—isthe actual ultimate is nothing but a case of confusing the finger that points to themoon with the moon itself.As shown before, there are countless passages in the sÒtras and Centrist textsthat explicitly reject an approach that insists on the ongoing cultivation of thismode of apprehending emptiness as a nonimplicative negation. For example,The SÒtra Requested by K›Ÿyapasays:K›Ÿyapa, as emptiness means to emerge from all views, I declare thatthose who have views about this very emptiness are incurable.N›g›rjuna’sSixty Stanzas on Reasoningstates:316The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 316"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Those whose minds are not moved,Not even by a flicker of a thought about “complete voidness,”Have crossed the horrifying ocean of existenceThat is agitated by the snakes of the afflictions.710HisCommentary on the Mind of Enlightenmentsays:So-called entities are conceptions.Lack of conceptions is emptiness.Wherever conceptions appear,How could there be emptiness?The emptiness that is called “nonarising,”“Emptiness,” and “identitylessness”Is what inferior beings meditate on.It is not the meditation on the [actual emptiness].What has the characteristic of the streamOf positive and negative thoughts being cut offThe Buddhas taught to be emptiness.The other [emptinesses] they did not declare to be emptiness.711Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrismsays:Ordinary beings are bound by conceptions.Nonconceptual yogins will find release.Hence, the learned state that the result of analysisIs that conceptions are at peace.712In his Entrance into the Two Realities, AtıŸa agrees:In the very profound sÒtras,It is said that nonseeing is to see this.Here, there is no seeing and no seer,No beginning and no end, just peace.Entities and nonentities are left behind.It is nonconceptual and nonreferential.713This applies in particular to the direct and nonconceptual realization of theexpanse of dharmas on the paths of seeing and meditation. At this point, nobleThe Middle from Beginning to End 317Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 317"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"beings no longer meditate through conceptual analysis, since they have alreadydirectly realized the true nature of phenomena free from dualistic appearancessuch as analysis and the object of analysis. Once there is such an immediate anddirect vision of ultimate reality that permeates one’s whole being, there isabsolutely no need to apply any investigation to ascertain a knowable object—emptiness as a nonimplicative negation—in an indirect way through inferentialvalid cognition based on reasoning. Tsongkhapa explicitly asserts that emptinessis a nonimplicative negation, so by definition, it can only be the object of a con-ceptual consciousness, since perceptual valid cognitions cannot have nonim-plicative negations as their objects. Thus, if what is to be cultivated in meditativeequipoise even by bodhisattvas on the path of seeing and the path of meditationis emptiness as a nonimplicative negation, the consciousness that cognizes thisnegation can only be an inferential valid cognition. However, this would cate-gorically exclude any possibility of a nonconceptual yogic valid perception ofemptiness. In addition, since—according to Tsongkhapa—such a nonimplicativenegation already is the actual ultimate reality, there would be no need to aban-don it and proceed to a direct realization.According to the teachings of the Buddha and the Indian commentaries, how-ever, such direct seeing of emptiness is precisely what happens in meditativeequipoise from the path of seeing onward upon the self-termination of concep-tual analysis once its objects are seen through, just as in the familiar example ofa fire dying down without firewood. Therefore, when the special irreversible cer-tainty that is the actual freedom from all discursiveness and reference points isdirectly realized and experienced, without any reference points, what objectwould be left for any analysis or any mode of apprehending anything? In thesame vein, to apprehend emptiness as a nonimplicative negation in meditativeequipoise moreover contradicts the standard Gelugpa position that the medita-tive equipoise of noble ones is completely without appearance. For if there are noappearances, there can be neither an object of analysis nor the subjective aspectof a mind that analyzes or apprehends anything.On the other hand, if there is any analytical mode of apprehension duringmeditative equipoise, this still represents the reference point of a more or lesssubtle clinging to or an apprehension of characteristics. Therefore, just like thecoarser apprehension of real existence, this very apprehension of a characteristic—be it emptiness, nonarising, a nonimplicative negation, or anything else—will alsoobscure the direct seeing of true reality as it actually is. In other words, within themeditative equipoise of noble ones that by definition is free from all dualisticappearances (that is, the nonconceptual and personally experienced wisdom thatrealizes the unity of appearance and emptiness), even supreme discriminatingknowledge itself has dissolved. Unlike such a direct vision through nonconcep-tual wisdom, discrimination or analysis cannot be without some object or refer-318The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 318"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"ence point that it discriminates. In terms of the example of sugar dissolving inwater, trying to maintain a powerful awareness of emptiness as a nonimplicativenegation in meditative equipoise is like trying to hold on to the fine particles ofsugar in the water in order to prevent them from fully dissolving.In his Chariot of the Tagbo Siddhas, the Eighth Karmapa comments on theway in which the supreme knowledge that realizes the two realities enters theultimate meditative absorption of cessation:The rays of the insight that has arisen from analysis dispel the darknessof the obstacles to seeing true reality and thus allow the light of truereality to clearly shine. . . . Ultimately, there is no entering into themeditative absorption of cessation. However, when engaging in [thisprocess on the level of] worldly conventional reality, through its power,the meditative absorption of cessation free from discursiveness isentered. Now, when [this insight] enters the meditative absorption ofthe cessation of [ordinary] mind and mental events, does it rest in thismeditative absorption by eliminating the superimpositions of [such]mind and mental events, or does it rest in it without eliminating thesesuperimpositions? In the first case, in terms of negative determination,the valid cognition of the supreme knowledge that arises from medita-tion would eliminate the superimpositions of mind and mental events.In terms of positive determination, it would directly appear for thiscognition that these objects—mind and mental events—are unarisen,which would be realized through personally experienced wisdom.Therefore, [this scenario] amounts to there being both a cognition andits object even within this meditative equipoise of cessation, that is,within emptiness, the nature of phenomena. In this case, entering themeditative absorption of cessation would be nothing but a name.As for the second case, some people might be concerned, “If the validcognition of the supreme knowledge that arises from meditation doesnot eliminate superimpositions, the meditative equipoise of [resting in]true reality—this meditative absorption of cessation—would not beunmistaken.” [In fact,] the valid cognition of the supreme knowledgethat arises from meditation indeed eliminates the superimpositionsthat are discordant with this meditative absorption of cessation. How-ever, when it eliminates [these superimpositions], in terms of positivedetermination, no direct appearance of mind and mental events notbeing established as anything whatsoever (such as them being unarisen)is brought about within such a cognition. The reason is that, once thevalid cognition of the supreme knowledge that arises from meditationThe Middle from Beginning to End 319Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 319"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"has eliminated all referential extremes of mind and mental events, it isabsorbed in what is determined—the way in which mind and mentalevents are unarisen—in such a way that it is not absorbed in existence,nonexistence, entity, nonentity, appearance, or nonappearance at all.When resting in this meditative equipoise of true reality in such a wayof not resting in meditative equipoise, there is no objective appear-ance and no subjective cognition that exist as one or different.714The Eighth Karmapa also discusses the emptiness of nirv› ̊a:From the perspective of both analysis and the seeing of noble ones,mere dependent origination and also the completely releasing libera-tion that is based on it are inexpressible as something other than per-fect nirv› ̊a. Hence, neither something to be attained, nor the meansto attain it, nor any attainment are established. However, at this point,it is also not said that “these do not exist.” Nor are they expressed asbeing both existent and nonexistent or being neither. Thus, withoutthinking or apprehending anything and without any effort, one evenlyrests in just this uncontrived and relaxed great ease in which there isnothing to do. Then, no matter what inner and outer appearances ofthe six collections [of consciousness] and their objects (the bearers ofthe nature [of phenomena]) emerge, through discriminating supremeknowledge and mindfulness, all of them are realized as their truenature, the natural state of emptiness. Just like snowflakes falling [andmelting] on a hot stone, one looks straight at appearance-emptiness,sound-emptiness, and awareness-emptiness and is directly released.715In brief, as long as the direct vision of ultimate reality has not dawned in themind, one definitely has to rely on the gradual refinement of discriminatingknowledge that entails more or less subtle modes of apprehension. However,once the nature of mind is directly realized, all analyses and modes of appre-hension naturally subside on their own, just as there is no longer a need to pon-der elaborate descriptions of the taste of an unknown Chinese dish on the menuonce it finally is in your mouth. Therefore, in terms of the different phases ofthe path, it is definitely inappropriate to insist on either the exclusive use ofanalytical meditation or the exclusive cultivation of resting meditation duringthe entire path. Rather, the distinction should concern the appropriate timingof analytical meditation with its various modes of apprehension and restingmeditation.320The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 320"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Madhyamaka ConductIn Buddhism, “conduct” generally means carrying the insights and experiencesfrom the more formal phases of studying, reflecting, and meditating into ourdaily lives. When we as ordinary beings look at our minds, there often is quitea gap between the experiences on our meditation cushion and those in “reallife.” In meditation, our mind may be lighter, more at ease, more transparent,and more compassionate than usual. In contrast, we may experience our every-day lives as much more real, solid, constricted, and painful, and we may have dif-ficulties in always being loving and compassionate toward ourselves and others.We might have glimpses of things as dreamlike and of genuine compassion orblessings, but none of these are very stable or lasting. Rather, such experiencesdepend very much on various outer and inner conditions, both favorable andunfavorable.When we compare our own experience to the descriptions of how bodhisattvason the ten grounds see the world, there is a big difference. From the first groundonward, in between their formal sessions of meditation, bodhisattvas actuallyexperience everything as illusionlike in a very immediate manner, without hav-ing to remind themselves that this is how things are. Finally, it is said that in aBuddha’s mind there is no experiential difference or separation at all between“being in meditation” and “doing other things.” In more technical terms, the twophases of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment have blended into onetaste, which is the constant awareness of the true nature of phenomena in what-ever is experienced or done. As the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrassay:The mind does not entertain any such fancies as “I rest in meditativeequipoise” or “I rise [from it].” If you wonder why, this is because thenature of phenomena is fully understood.The single factor that accounts for these differences is the wisdom that realizesemptiness. One’s experiences and reactions outside of formal meditation aredetermined by the degree to which one is able to uninterruptedly sustain thebasic ground of nonreferential ultimate reality in every moment. In other words,the more prajñ›’s direct realization of emptiness becomes an integral part of one’severyday experience, the less there is a gap between the two. In this way, conductis nothing other than continuing, sustaining, and enhancing our meditation afterhaving left our meditation cushions. Hence, in terms of having realized empti-ness, conduct means “being free from the three spheres”—that is, any notion ofagent, object, and action—in all activities.Meditation and conduct are thus mutually beneficial. Not only does our med-itation inform and support our conduct, but the training in eliminating ourThe Middle from Beginning to End 321Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 321"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"deeply ingrained habits also supports and enhances our insights in meditation.Proper conduct is also helpful, because without enriching and moistening ourminds through accumulating huge quantities of positive mental imprints andcultivating compassion, there is no way for our minds to turn into the fertileground that is necessary for cultivating the realization of emptiness. In the end,meditation and conduct become inseparable once the direct realization of thenature of our minds and all phenomena is continuously present throughout dayand night. This is what is called Buddhahood. This intimate relation between prajñ› and conduct, or the means, is alsoexpressed in the first verse of the ninth chapter of The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’sWay of Life:All of these branches [of the first five perfections]Were taught by the Sage for the sake of knowledge.Therefore, those who wish for sufferingTo subside should develop knowledge.Thus, knowledge or wisdom always pervades all other practices of a bodhisattva,and these in turn support and further the realization of emptiness. In fact,⁄›ntideva’s entire text is nothing but a practice manual on how to link the real-ization of ultimate reality to all the aspects of skillful compassionate conduct.Precisely this is “the bodhisattva’s way of life,” which is nothing other than theunity of knowledge and means.Since Buddhist studies and practices are designed to influence our mostingrained habitual tendencies, they generally represent processes that naturallyrequire repeated efforts and skillful training until their transformative powerbecomes directly and continually manifest in the way in which we experience ourworld. Just as we need training when learning to play a musical instrument, con-duct is the continuous rehearsal of our lessons in meditation. Thus, after havingtrained in the safe surroundings of the calm pool of our meditation, we can dareto jump into the big waves of the ocean of daily life and maybe even surf them.Especially in Centrism, conduct involves the notion of gradually going beyondboth our problems and their remedies. As a bodhisattva, one develops the aspir-ing mind of enlightenment by taking the vow to liberate all sentient beings fromsuffering. Motivated by this altruistic attitude, conduct is the expression of prac-tically applying this vow by continuously working with the six perfections untilone attains the omniscience, infinite compassion, and power of a Buddha, whichcontinually and effortlessly accomplish the welfare of all beings. At the sametime, conduct equally entails familiarization with the fact that there are no suchthings as bodhisattvas, sentient beings, the two obscurations, the six perfectionsas their remedies, the relinquishment of stains, or the attainment of qualities.

As thePrajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrassay:Understanding the five aggregates as illusionlike,Not taking illusions and the aggregates to be different,Being free from all kinds of notions, and being engaged in utter peace,This is the conduct of the supreme perfection of knowledge.The unity of realization and activity is wonderfully summarized by Padma sam -bhava:Our view is as high as the skyAnd our conduct is as fine as barley flour.Milarepa puts it as follows:Regard this life as a dream and an illusion,And cultivate compassion for those who do not realize this.Thus, the realization of emptiness in no way undermines the compassionateefforts of bodhisattvas to liberate all beings, nor does it turn these efforts intoabsurdities. Rather, it opens up a wider perspective in each situation and helpsbodhisattvas see clearly what actions are most beneficial. The realization of empti-ness enhances their mindfulness and compassion and enables them to care aboutevery detail of mental, verbal, and physical actions in the realm of seeming real-ity. At the same time, seeing the dreamlike quality of all of this turns the conductof a bodhisattva into a graceful dance of comforting those who do not see thisquality and thus teaching them how to dance too. The melodious sound ofemptiness is the perfect tune to accompany the elegant and supple steps thatcompassion takes. This dance may assume limitless expressions, such as a bod-hisattva attending a sick person, reciting prayers, or even debating with others byusing Centrist reasonings.TMadhyamaka FruitionUltimately speaking, of course, perfect Buddhahood as the fruition of the Cen-trist path is inexpressible. Thus, many Centrist texts say that a Buddha does notThe Middle from Beginning to End 323Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 323"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"have wisdom and that the three enlightened bodies do not exist. However, in typ-ical Centrist discourse, this does not imply the absolute and total nonexistenceof wisdom or the enlightened bodies, just as the negation of arising does notmean that nonarising is established or asserted. Any thinking in dualistic cate-gories, such as existence or nonexistence, is considered by Centrists to be just anexpression of a reifying mind. Since the very aim of Centrism is to eliminate allreification and fixation, one also needs to let go of the notion that wisdom orBuddhahood is established as something existent in any way. Nor is it some inertthing or utter nothingness after everything has become annihilated. As the natureof all phenomena is completely free from all reference points, so also is the natureof wisdom when analyzed. Since even ordinary things do not fit into any cate-gories, such as existent and nonexistent, how could these categories ever apply tothe very result of eliminating all these dualistic notions?Similarly, the phrase “Buddhas do not have wisdom” points to the transcen-dence of subject and object. The wisdom of the vajralike meditative concentra-tion at the very end of the tenth bodhisattva ground naturally settles within theexpanse of dharmas. Within the nature of phenomena, there is no differencebetween subject and object, but ignorant beings superimpose subjects and objectsonto the expanse of dharmas and cling to them. Once all clinging is exhausted,this expanse, which is primordially without the duality of subject and object, isrealized as it is.Saying what Buddhahood is and what it is not are two ways of saying the samething. The exhaustion of all clinging and reference points is called “perfect relin-quishment,” that is, relinquishment of both afflictive and cognitive obscurationstogether with all their latent tendencies. The undifferentiable unity of nonrefer-ential expanse and nondual wisdom is called “perfect realization.” However, sincethe very exhaustion of clinging and reference points reveals the expanse of dhar-mas, relinquishment and realization are simply two different ways of expressingthe same state, which is perfect Buddhahood. Thus, when the aspect of thetwofold purity of the “enlightened” expanse of dharmas—its primordial purityand its purity in the sense that all adventitious stains have been relinquished—isemphasized, it is also called Essence Body. When one refers to this expanse ofdharmas in terms of the aspect of wisdom or realization, it is usually calledDharma Body. Another way of expressing the meaning of “Buddha” refers toawakening from the dull sleep of ignorance into the bright daylight of the expanseof omniscient wisdom.Thus, in this expanse of Buddahood whose nature it is to be without subjectand object, there is no wisdom as the realizing subject of any object to be real-ized. On the other hand, if Buddhas had no omniscient wisdom at all, it wouldfollow that their relinquishment of cognitive obscurations in order to directlyrealize all knowable objects would be pointless. It would be useless to relinquish324The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 324"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"all cognitive obscurations, because this would not bring about such omniscientwisdom. Also, if there were no wisdom, all mundane and supramundane quali-ties that are based on it would not exist either. However, the Prajñ›p›ramit›sÒtrassay again and again that all qualities of the other five perfections and so ondo not come about without the perfection of knowledge or wisdom. The EighthKarmapa suggests that, on the mere conventional level, there is no contradictionin saying, “An illusionlike knowable object that lacks a nature is known or real-ized by an illusionlike knowing that lacks a nature,” since, conventionally, it istaught that “to see what is not to be seen is to see the truth.” This is just as unde-niable in terms of mere worldly convention as describing the reflection of my facein a mirror as “seeing my face in the mirror.” In actual fact, however, since Cen-trists simply make no statement about whether wisdom exists or does not exist,they do not even say, “In our own system, we do not say anything about whetherwisdom exists or does not exist.”Thus, any presentations of “buddhology” in Centrist texts are meant as con-ventional descriptions that in themselves point to nonreferential openness-aware-ness. The three enlightened bodies, the four or five wisdoms, nonreferentialcompassion, and enlightened activity certainly do function and interact with sen-tient beings, but they cannot be solidified or pinned down in any way.Conventionally speaking, wisdom and Buddhahood may be expressed in eithera negative or an affirmative way. They may be described through the via negatio-nis, in terms of what they are not or what they are free from. Or, sometimes evenin the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras, they are described through the via eminentiae, interms of very rich presentations of a Buddha’s omniscient wisdom and the variousbodies of enlightenment with their infinite marvelous qualities and enlightenedactivities. In general, Centrists usually follow the first approach, while such textsas Maitreya’sOrnament of Clear Realizationand his Sublime Continuumoften takethe latter. However, in the end, both approaches share the desired effect of “blow-ing your mind”: transcending all conceptual limitations regarding Buddhahood.Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrism, in basing its explanations on N›g›rjuna’swork, mainly employs the negative approach. However, by also relying on TheSÒtra of the Ten Grounds,716Candrakırti describes omniscient wisdom as beingfree from all reference points and at the same time possessing all Buddha quali-ties, such as the ten powers.Just as space is without divisions through the divisions created by vessels,In true reality, there are no divisions that are created by entities.Therefore, by perfectly realizing them to be of equal taste,You, excellent Knower, realize [all] knowable objects in a single moment.The profound [quality] is emptiness.The Middle from Beginning to End 325Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 325"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"The other qualities are vast.Through the knowledge of the ways of profundity and vastness,These qualities will be swiftly obtained.717Candrakırti’s text elaborates on the three enlightened bodies of a Buddha andtheir qualities, especially the ten powers.718His Autocommentarysupports thisexplanation by extensively quoting from various sÒtras that describe these qual-ities in very rich and colorful detail. Pawo Rinpoche explains the example ofspace in the first verse above:All phenomena always abide as the true reality, that is, the expanse ofdharmas that is unconditioned like space. This is similar to the lack ofa difference between the space within a vase and the space outside ofit, even if this vase has not been broken. When the vase is broken, theundifferentiable unity of the space within it and outside of it becomesrevealed as this undifferentiable unity. The nature of the mind thatprimordially abides as the expanse of dharmas is similar to the spacewithin the vase. Just as in the case of the undifferentiable unity of thespace within this vase and outside of it when the vase is broken, onceall vaselike thoughts and mental currents completely subside, [thenature of the mind] is revealed to be no different from the expanse ofdharmas. Just as nobody can identify the size of space, nobody canimagine the nature of the Thus-Gone Ones. Just as space providesroom for all things, [Buddhahood] serves as the support for all sentientbeings. Just as space may appear in any size that corresponds to [everyphenomenon], from a trichiliocosm down to the [empty] husk of amustard seed, [Buddhahood] appears as [manifold] enlightened bod-ies for all those that are to be trained. Just as one is not able to label allthese [kinds of] space as being one or different, all the bodies of theBuddhas cannot be designated as being one or different either. . . . [Asfor this undifferentiable unity,] there is no difference whether some-one has become enlightened or not. Conventionally though, not real-izing this [undifferentiable unity] is labeled “the phase of cyclicexistence,” while its realization, just as it is, [is called] “the attainmentof Buddhahood.” At this point, however, there is neither a conditionednor an unconditioned substance or entity that is attained, nor [is there]anybody or anything that is the attainer [of anything]. Therefore, [theBuddha] said that the mere exhaustion of mistakenness is liberation.719Elsewhere, Pawo Rinpoche mentions that AtıŸa explains the final view of⁄›ntideva as being the undifferentiable unity of expanse and wisdom.326The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 326"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"An analogy for the exhaustion of mistakenness is when the disease of blurredvision has been removed, and there are no more appearances of floating hairsand such. Likewise, for a Buddha, all causes for mistakenness have been com-pletely relinquished, so from the perspective of a Buddha’s wisdom, the phe-nomena of seeming reality no longer appear. Just as not seeing any floating hairsis said to be correct seeing, not seeing any reference points whatsoever is expressedas “seeing the basic nature of these phenomena.” Another example of seeing bynot seeing is a person who wonders whether it is possible to paint space. Throughnot “seeing”—that is, not finding—any possibility of applying paint to space, thisperson “sees” in the sense of understanding that one is not able to paint space.In consequence, one may wonder whether Buddhas see the five aggregates andsuch or not. Since there is no mental flux, such as arising or ceasing, in a Bud-dha, from a Buddha’s own perspective, there is no flux in terms of seeing and notseeing or in terms of wisdom arising and ceasing. From the perspective of others,however, it appears as if a Buddha has the omniscient wisdom of the ten powersand such that sees all phenomena, because this wisdom undeceivingly occurs asthe mere dependently originated result of having fully gathered the accumulationof wisdom.Unlike our physical body, which can only be trained up to a certain limit—such as jumping no higher than eight feet or lifting no more than eight hundredpounds—Buddhism says that there is no limit in training the mind, since it is notbound by any physical dimensions. The Buddhas have accumulated the two infi-nite accumulations of merit and wisdom through infinite skillful means andknowledge for many eons in order to benefit infinite sentient beings. So in termsof the law of causality, it is only justified that this infinity of causes bring aboutthe infinite results of a Buddha’s wisdoms and enlightened activities for the wel-fare of infinite sentient beings as long as cyclic existence exists.Some people say that, on the level of a Buddha, there exists a momentarily aris-ing and ceasing chain of awareness and illusionlike mistaken appearances. How-ever, this is not justified. First, since all phenomena are free from all such extremesas arising and ceasing, a Buddha’s wisdom is no exception. If a Buddha’s wisdom,though free from reference points, involved arising and ceasing, then it wouldentail reference points. It makes no sense that a Buddha’s wisdom should haverealized that all phenomena lack arising but not realize that it itself lacks arisingtoo. Furthermore, it would follow from the above position that worldly beingswho are ensnared by the web of reference points, such as arising and ceasing, alsosee true reality. In addition, it would not be suitable for the noble ones to teachsuch beings that all phenomena lack arising. And since mistaken appearances onlyappear due to basic unawareness, there would also be basic unawareness on thelevel of a Buddha, because false objects appear to them, just as it is the case for adream-consciousness. Some people claim, “The Buddhas have such appearances,The Middle from Beginning to End 327Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 327"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"but since they do not cling to them as being real, they are not mistaken.” How-ever, then it would absurdly follow that the consciousnesses of people with blurredvision who see floating hairs and double moons are also not mistaken, as long asthey do not cling to these hairs and moons as being really existent.Another position regarding what enlightened beings see is the argument of“pure vision,” which is found in such statements as “Since ignorance is the causefor impure appearances, such as stones and earth, they do not appear to Buddhas.On the other hand, completely pure appearances, such as mandalas, emergewithin the natural unceasing display of wisdom. Since Buddhas have such pureappearances, they are not mistaken.” However, also these pure appearances arenot established as pure by their own nature, because they originate from priorpositive actions, such as making aspiration prayers and purifying Buddha-fields.Thus, they are nothing but dependent origination. Therefore, it is not contra-dictory that the seeming does not appear for the Buddhas’ own perspective yetthey still perform activities for the welfare of others, such as knowing the rangeof all phenomena and turning the wheel of dharma. The reason is that such activ-ities are the result of having perfectly engaged in their causes—the dependentorigination of the accumulation of merit—during their prior times as bod-hisattvas on the various paths.In brief, there is no way to identify the wisdom of a Buddha through any dis-cussions in terms of existence or nonexistence. Rather, since it is the ultimatenature of all phenomena to be completely free from reference points, ultimately,any kind of mind must be free from reference points too. In particular, in orderto be able to realize this freedom from reference points, the wisdom of a Buddhaas the subject to realize this must necessarily be free from all clinging to referencepoints with regard to true reality, including the latent tendencies for such cling-ing. Therefore, Buddhahood means to rest in the undifferentiable unity of wis-dom and the expanse of dharmas that is free from being one and different, subjectand object, and so on. In this unity, all phenomena, such as samsaric flaws andnirvanic qualities, are just equality. That this is what constitutes Buddhahood wassaid by Buddha ⁄›kyamuni, his regent Maitreya, N›g›rjuna and his spiritualheirs, as well as many others time and again. Here, Centrists say that from the per-spective of worldly mistakenness without analysis, just as all phenomena of seem-ing reality exist, the wisdom of a Buddha also exists. When analyzed, from theperspective of Buddhahood, just as the wisdom experience of a Buddha is freefrom all reference points of existence and nonexistence, likewise all phenomenaare free from such reference points.As for the enlightened bodies of a Buddha, The Entrance into Centrismstates:The dry firewood of knowable objects having been totally incinerated,This peace is the Dharma Body of the Victors.328The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 328"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"At this point, there is neither arising nor ceasing.The cessation of mind is revealed through this Body.720Candrakırti’s autocommentary explains:In this Body that has the nature of wisdom and [in which] the dryfirewood of knowable objects has been totally burned away, there is noarising of knowable objects.

Thus, the object of wis-dom—true reality—is in no case engaged by the [corresponding]subjects of such [knowable objects], that is, mind and mental events.Hence, on the seeming level, this is expressed as [true reality] beingrevealed through this very Body.721When the verse speaks about “the cessation of mind,” this does not mean thatsome mind that still really existed at the end of the tenth bodhisattva groundbecomes nonexistent when Buddhahood is attained. It is impossible for some-thing that really existed before to become nonexistent later. Likewise, what neverexisted in the first place cannot later become nonexistent either. Thus, the expres-sion “cessation of mind” is just a conventional label for the dissolution of theentirety of clinging in terms of mind and mental events or for the vanishing ofall mistaken appearances of basic unawareness.Pawo Rinpoche comments that, through training on all the paths of familiariz-ing with the fact that the entire collection of the firewood of knowable objectslacks a nature, this firewood has become free from the dampness of reification. Atthe end of the tenth bodhisattva ground, the completely dried-out remainder of thisfirewood is instantly consumed by the momentary blazing wisdom of the vajralikemeditative concentration. Once there is no firewood left, the fire itself then sub-sides too. This example should not be misunderstood to mean that the DharmaBody is just utter nonexistence, because the firewood that is burned by firelikewisdom consists of precisely these reifications of existence and nonexistence. Whenwisdom has consumed all there is to consume, it just naturally settles within theprimordial expanse. In this way, the expanse of dharmas is revealed in its primor-dial uncontrived state. This is what is called “attaining the Dharma Body” and“the perfection of one’s own welfare.” This very Dharma Body then appears to var-ious disciples as the manifold manifestations of the two Form Bodies: the Body ofComplete Enjoyment and the Emanation Body. Through such appearances, itteaches the dharma and helps the disciples realize true reality, or the Dharma Body.In this way, the Form Bodies constitute “the perfection of the welfare of others.”The relationship between these three enlightened bodies is often illustratedby comparing the Dharma Body to the sun in the sky, the Body of CompleteThe Middle from Beginning to End 329Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 329"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Enjoyment to the reflection of the sun in a lake, and the Emanation Body to thisreflection’s reflection in a mirror. Just as both reflections depend on the sun inthe sky and may serve to make us see this sun, the two Form Bodies depend onand point back to the Dharma Body. The Dharma Body—freedom from refer-ence points—is what Buddhas themselves experience or see through their per-sonally experienced wisdom. The reference points of the Form Bodies with alltheir qualities and activities are seen by different disciples in dependence on thevarious degrees of purification of their lakelike or mirrorlike minds. The disciplesalso hear the words of these Form Bodies and practice the dharma that comesfrom the minds of these Form Bodies as an object of their own minds when theystudy, reflect, and meditate on it. However, all of this is not possible with regardto the Dharma Body. Even when the Buddhas themselves see this Dharma Body,they only see it in a manner of nonseeing. Thus, other beings are definitely notable to observe it in any way that involves a seer and something seen.It is said that the Body of Complete Enjoyment appears only in the oceanlikemirror of the stainless wisdom attained by bodhisattvas on the tenth ground whoare free from reference points. This appearance of the Body of Complete Enjoy-ment possesses the five certainties:1) Its abode is certain as being only the sphere of Akani ̋ ̨ha.7222) Its nature is certain in that it is adorned with the major and minor marks of aBuddha.3) Its retinue is certain in that it consists only of bodhisattvas on the ten grounds.4) Its time is certain, meaning that it appears in an unceasing way.5) Its certain enjoyment is solely the teachings of the great vehicle.As for the Emanation Body, there are three main types:1) Supreme Emanation Bodies show as fully enlightened Buddhas (such as Bud-dha ⁄›kyamuni) with all their major and minor marks and perform the twelvedeeds of such Buddhas.2) Artistic Emanation Bodies can, for example, manifest as a masterful lute playeramong the celestial musicians to teach them in this way, or as great scientists,physicians, and artists who benefit many beings.3) Incarnated Emanation Bodies can appear in all kinds of animate and inanimateforms, such as various gods, animals, and even bridges or trees appearing inorder to help certain sentient beings. The appearance of the two Form Bodies with their enlightened activitiesdepends on the coming together of three conditions:330The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 330"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"1) the blessings or the potency of the Dharma Body2) a Buddha’s former aspiration prayers3) the appropriate karmic and mental dispositions of individual disciplesIf the Form Bodies and their enlightened activities could operate due to thepotency of the Dharma Body alone, all sentient beings would effortlessly meetBuddhas and attain liberation, since the Dharma Body is omnipresent and all-pervading. This is not to say that the Form Bodies and enlightened activity aremerely an appearance from the perspective of ordinary sentient beings, since themental perspective of ordinary beings is essentially deceiving in that they mis-takenly perceive and conceive what is actually not there. So if the Form Bodieswere just appearances in the mistaken minds of sentient beings, and if these sen-tient beings could become enlightened in dependence on such appearances, itwould absurdly follow that we all have been enlightened for a long time, since weall have engaged in mistaken appearances since beginningless time. Nor are theForm Bodies and their enlightened activities solely an outcome of the impetus ofa Buddha’s former aspiration prayers alone. Such aspiration prayers are made forthe sake of all sentient beings, so if only these prayers were needed, all sentientbeings would be liberated without any efforts of their own.The completion of former aspiration prayers and the two accumulations ofmerit and wisdom are the causes for the ongoing impetus of enlightened activ-ity. Once enlightened wisdom displays its activity, it manifests in a spontaneousand unceasing way that is completely effortless and nonconceptual. Thus, a bod-hisattva’s progression on the path that eventually results in such Buddha activitywithin the expanse of nonreferentiality can be compared to the flight of a rocket.Initially, it requires a lot of energy to lift off the ground, but the higher the rocketascends, the easier and faster its motion becomes and the less energy it needs.Finally, once it glides in the vacuum of outer space, it moves on forever withoutneeding any further energy, just through the power of the fuel that has alreadybeen spent.In brief, a “Buddha” is not a person in the sense of a collection of matter andconsciousness. Buddha ⁄›kyamuni himself said that if one thinks that his phys-ical appearance and speech are the Buddha, one could not be more mistaken. Theappearances of a Buddha’s Form Bodies are neither a part of the aggregate ofform nor a part of any of the mental aggregates, since Buddhahood transcendsthe five aggregates and is completely beyond both cyclic existence and nirv› ̊a.However, this does not mean that, conventionally, the Form Bodies are not Bud-dhas, since what they say is the Buddhadharma, which when practiced accord-ingly by sentient beings leads to their enlightenment. Nor are the Form Bodiesthe same as the bodies of ordinary sentient beings; they are the bodies of Buddhas,and this is also how they appear to various disciples. Thus, Buddhahood is beyondThe Middle from Beginning to End 331Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 331"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"form but still displays all kinds of form.

That itis without middle and end goes even beyond the example of space, since it is atthe same time the sole foundation for the true benefit and happiness of all beings.Therefore, when the enlightened bodies of a Buddha are presented in terms ofthe two realities, their characteristics are described solely in dependence on theminds of certain disciples. In the context of the two realities, it is said that theDharma Body and the Essence Body are nothing but freedom from referencepoints without any arising and ceasing, while the Body of Complete Enjoymentand the Emanation Body involve reference points, such as arising and ceasing.However, from the perspective of a Buddha, there is not the slightest differencebetween these four enlightened bodies, such as that certain ones among themrepresent ultimate reality and others belong to seeming reality, or that only somerepresent Buddhahood while others do not.

This is not to say that thebasis for the Autonomist-Consequentialist distinction cannot be traced back toIndian Centrist texts, but there were certainly no subschools with such names.The best way to understand this distinction is in terms of methodology, as dif-ferent approaches to understanding and communicating the same emptiness.TClassifications of Centrism in India and TibetDespite certain disagreements on some issues between individual Centrist mas-ters in India (such as Buddhap›lita, Bh›vaviveka, and Candrakırti), for manycenturies there appeared no divisions into Centrist subschools.724Before the timeof Bh›vaviveka, no controversy among Centrists is recorded at all. Bh›vaviveka’sown Jewel Lamp of Centrismtalks about two levels within Centrist practice as awhole, but these are equally taught by all Centrists and thus not meant as a dis-tinction between two schools or views.Having thus taught the coarse yoga, now, the subtle yoga is to betaught: . . . In just the way that all phenomena occur as appearancesof mere illusory mind, in that way mere illusory mind is beyond thethree times, without color and shape, naturally luminous, and withoutappearance. Therefore, it is to be understood that all phenomena areillusory mind. Thus, to speak about seeming reality in the way of thehearers is the “outer, coarse Centrism.” That this [seeming reality]abides as one’s own mere mind is the “subtle, inner Centrism.”725In the eighth century, ⁄›ntarak ̋ita’s own commentary on his Ornament ofCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 333"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Centrismdistinguishes two ways of Centrists analyzing the causally efficient enti-ties of seeming reality:1) those like himself who consider these entities as having the nature of meremind726and2) those who accept them as outer objects and thus interpret the teaching on“mere mind” as merely negating an agent and an experiencer.As an example of the latter approach, he quotes Bh›vaviveka’s Heart of CentrismV.28cd.727KamalaŸıla’s subcommentary on ⁄›ntarak ̋ita’s text glosses this difference as“the two Centrist paths that analyze this [issue] to be analyzed” and explicitly con-firms Bh›vaviveka’s text as representing the latter “path.”728On the other hand,in his Commentary on The Synopsis of True Reality,729he speaks of undifferentiatedCentrists, while dividing the Yog›c›ra school into Aspectarians and Non-Aspec-tarians.As for the various Indian commentaries on ⁄›ntideva’s Entrance to the Bod-hisattva’s Way of Life(ranging from the late tenth to the early thirteenth century)that are preserved in the Tengyur, both when referring to ⁄›ntideva’s words andin general, all of them only speak about “Centrists,” never mentioning any sub-divisions. This is especially noteworthy in light of the fact that ⁄›ntideva is con-sidered a Consequentialist by many Tibetan teachers (as mentioned earlier, theEighth Karmapa sees him as a “Centrist of the model texts”).730One of AtıŸa’s teachers, Ratn›karaŸ›nti (early eleventh century), in his Presen-tation of the Three Vehicles,731classifies Centrists as follows:1) Centrists who regard the seeming as an aspect of consciousness2) Centrists who regard the seeming as mere latent tendenciesAtıŸa’s main Centrist teacher Bodhibhadra (c. 1000), in his Explanation of TheCompendium of the Heart of Wisdom, also mentions a difference between Centristsas to how they present seeming reality:1) those like Bh›vaviveka who do not evaluate appearances2) those like ⁄›ntarak ̋ita who say that appearing entities are not as they seem butthat it is solely internal consciousness that appears as various things732The position of AtıŸa (982–1054) himself is rather complex. His Centrist PithInstructionsidentifies the Centrist texts by N›g›rjuna, firyadeva, M›t ̧ce ̨a,733Kambala,734and Candrakırti as the unrivaled model texts for all Centrist scrip-tures. Other masters in his list of Centrists include Bh›vaviveka, Buddhap›lita,DevaŸarman,735Avalokitavrata, ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, and KamalaŸıla.736In his Entrance334The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 334"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"into the Two Realities, he says that the ones who have fully understood emptinessare N›g›rjuna and Candrakırti.737On the other hand, he uses the distinction ofthe correct and false seeming and defines the correct seeming in precisely thesame way as Jñ›nagarbha and ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, who at a later point came to be calledAutonomists.738Also in contrast to N›g›rjuna and Candrakırti, AtıŸa in his auto-commentary onThe Lamp for the Path to Enlightenmentexplicitly recommendsthe provisional use of valid cognition (particularly inference) as presented byDharmakırti and Dharmottara when meditating on the ultimate as it is trans-mitted in N›g›rjuna’s pith instructions.739The same text identifies firyadeva,Candrakırti, Bh›vaviveka, ⁄›ntideva, and AtıŸa’s own teacher Bodhibhadra asthe true authorities of Centrism who follow N›g›rjuna.740 Later, he repeats thislist as representing those who have unmistakenly realized true reality (the essenceof the meaning of the perfection of knowledge) and adds AŸvagho ̋a and Can-dragomı741to it.742In his Precious Garland of True Reality,743Maitrıpa (1012–1097) presents the fol-lowing classification of Centrism:1) Proponents of Illusionlike Nonduality744and2) Proponents of the Complete Nonabiding of all PhenomenaThrough a quotation from Bh›vaviveka’s texts, Maitrıpa aligns him with the firstapproach, while it remains unclear who represents the second.745The same dis-tinction is made in Candrahari’s Jewel Garland746and alluded to in AŸvagho ̋a’sStages of Meditation on the Ultimate Mind of Enlightenment.747Both reject theapproach of establishing illusions in any way.The Treasury of Knowledge748reports that the eleventh-century Kashmiri mas-ter Lak ̋mıkara in his Commentary on The Five Stages749explains a threefold clas-sification:1) the Centrism of SÒtras7502) the Centrism of Yoga Practice7513) the Centrism of the Mother of the Victors (the perfection of knowledge)Sahajavajra (eleventh/twelfth century), in his Commentary on The Ten Verses onTrue Reality,752speaks about Aspectarian Centrists753(such as ⁄›ntarak ̋ita) andNon-Aspectarian Centrists754(such as Kambala) as those Centrists who do notteach the definitive meaning of true reality, which is presented by Centrists suchas N›g›rjuna, firyadeva, and Candrakırti.This shows that even in late Indian Buddhism there was no clear or mutuallyexclusive distinction of subschools in Indian Centrism and that the works of allthe above masters were evidently studied side by side. The main distinction, ifThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 335Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 335"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"any, seems to have been between those who conventionally accept outer objectsas a part of seeming reality (either explicitly or by following common worldly con-sensus) and those who interpret seeming reality in a way similar to the Yog›c›ras.Unlike the Autonomist-Consequentialist distinction, this would placeBh›vaviveka and Candrakırti on the same side. On the subject of a distinctionwithin Centrism, Candrakırti is conspicuously never even mentioned. AtıŸa seemsto have held him in high regard but does not distinguish his view fromBh›vaviveka’s.In Tibet, it was the great translator Yeshe De755(early ninth century) in his Dif-ferences of the Views756who first used the terms “Centrism of SÒtras” and “Cen-trism of Yoga Practice,” with Bh›vaviveka belonging to the former and⁄›ntarak ̋ita to the latter. Other texts from this early period also mention one orboth of these names.757In one of the Tibetan manuscripts from Dunhuang, a dis-tinction is made between “outer Centrism”758and “inner Yoga-Centrism.”759Thegreat Sanskrit-Tibetan Dictionary Mah›vyutpatti,760compiled in the ninth cen-tury by a number of Indian pa ̊ ̃itas and Tibetan translators, has no subdivi-sions of its entry “Centrists.”In three of his texts, the eleventh-century Nyingma master Rongzom Pa ̊ ̃itaChökyi Sangbo761refers to the Centrism of SÒtras and the Centrism of YogaPractice.762Among these,The Memorandum on the Viewssays:The two types of Centrism are dissimilar as to the mode of being of theseeming. As for which one [of them] is greater in terms of scripture andreasoning in this respect, it seems that, according to the general waysof sÒtras and tantras, the general ways of reasoning, and the texts of theCentrist preceptors N›g›rjuna and firyadeva as the masters who com-posed the [Centrist] model texts, the texts of the Centrists of YogaPractice are of greater significance.763Once, Rongzom Pa ̊ ̃ita also mentions the distinction between those who asserteverything as illusionlike and those who assert nonabiding. He nowhere speaksof the Autonomist-Consequentialist distinction.Rog Bande Sherab Ö764distinguishes “factional Centrism” after the modeltexts by N›g›rjuna and firyadeva into the Centrism of SÒtras (Jñ›nagarbha), theCentrism of Yoga Practice (⁄›ntarak ̋ita), and the texts of Centrism in general(KamalaŸıla).Gampopa (1079–1153) classified Centrism as illusionlike nonduality and com-plete nonabiding.765He subdivided the latter into “complete nonabiding ofunity”766and “complete nonabiding of severed continuity.”767Whether this latter classification matches with the Autonomist-Consequen-tialist distinction and whether it differentiates the view of Centrists on ultimate336The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 336"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"reality was a subject of some discussion in Tibet. Ngog Lots›wa rejected the lat-ter point, and Tsongkhapa stated that this rejection is good. The Treasury ofKnowledgeportrays the Proponents of Illusionlike Nonduality (such asKamalaŸıla) as saying that the compound of appearance and emptiness is ultimatereality. The Proponents of Complete Nonabiding (such as Buddhap›lita) saythat ultimate reality is what is positively determined through the negative deter-mination that consists in excluding all discursiveness with regard to appearances.Another way to put this is that all phenomena are merely designated throughnames, symbols, and conventions but do not abide in any such ways as they aredesignated. Padma Karpo’s Illumination of Three Centrist Scriptural Systemsexplains the difference between these two types of Centrists and presents Auton-omists and Consequentialists as subdivisions of the Proponents of the completeNonabiding of all Phenomena:Those who speak about [everything] being illusionlike assert that allouter and inner phenomena are illusionlike, both from the point ofview of cutting through discursiveness and from the point of view ofnonconceptual resting in meditative equipoise. Even when Buddha-hood has dawned, also nondual wisdom or the three enlightened bod-ies are illusionlike. This is the case, because it is said in [the sÒtras of]the Mother of the Victors:All phenomena, nirv› ̊a, and even a hypothetical phenomenonthat is much superior to this are illusionlike and dreamlike.768The system of the nonabiding Centrists does not itself have anythingthat is to be positively determined or proven but puts an end to theclaims of others. It is twofold: Autonomists are those who negate theclaims of others by relying on reasonings that cut through discursive-ness and stem from the three modes being established by valid cogni-tion. Consequentialists do not accept that the three modes areestablished by valid cognition and negate the wrong ideas of others bystating the claims of these [others] as reasons.769The first one to introduce the terms “Autonomists” and “Consequentialists”is said to be Patsab Lots›wa in the eleventh century, but none of his texts is pre-served.770So the earliest available Tibetan source for the explicit distinctionbetween Autonomists and Consequentialists seems to be the commentary on theninth chapter of The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life771by Sönam Dsemo(1142–1182), the second supreme head of the Sakya school.The Eighth Karmapa refers to Majaba772and other logicians as consideringThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 337Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 337"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"degrees of superiority and inferiority in terms of the knowledge that results fromstudying, reflecting, and meditating as the means to establish Madhyamaka aswell as whether there is something to be evaluated with regard to the contentthat is to be established. Based on such considerations, they speak about twokinds of Centrists: those who, in the context of Centrism, establish referents773and those who establish conventions.774The Centrists who establish referents arenot the superior Centrists, while those Centrists who do not establish referents,but establish mere conventions in order to put an end to wrong ideas, are thesuperior Centrists. As for the knowledge that realizes Madhyamaka or emptinessas that which is to be established through these two ways of determining, Majabaand others delineate a difference as to this knowledge being inferential validcognition and it being the valid cognition that is a reasoning consciousness.Due to these differences, they say that these two systems are inferior and supe-rior respectively.Majaba Jangchub Dsöndrü’s commentary on The Fundamental Versesuses theterm “Centrists who propound autonomous [reasoning].”775The third head of the Sakyapas, Tragba Gyaltsen776(1147–1216), gives a five-fold classification of Centrists with regard to seeming reality:1) followers of common worldly consensus2) those who accord with the way of the Followers of the Great Exposition3) illusionists4) followers of the sÒtras5) yoga practitioners777Other early Tibetan writers such as Sakya Pa ̊ ̃ita (1182–1251), Butön RinchenDrub (1290–1364), Longchen Rabjampa (1308–1363), Barawa Gyaltsen Balsang778(1310–1391), and Rendawa779(1349–1412) employed one or more of the above clas-sifications.Specifically, Butön in his History of Buddhism780uses a threefold classification:1) the Centrism of SÒtras (Bh›vaviveka)2) the Centrism of Yoga Practice (Jñ›nagarbha, ⁄rıgupta, ⁄›ntarak ̋ita,KamalaŸıla, and Haribhadra)3) the Centrism following common worldly consensus (Buddhap›lita, Can-drakırti)He explicitly gives “Consequentialist Centrists” as another name for the Centristsfollowing common worldly consensus but does not even mention the term“Autonomists.” Butön is moreover reported to have said that, after the debate ofSamye, Centrism branched into three lineages, with KamalaŸıla establishing a338The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 338"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"third lineage (the Centrism of Yoga Practice) as distinct from the lineages ofBh›vaviveka and Candrakırti.781Elsewhere Butön says that the distinctionbetween Autonomists and Consequentialists is a conceptual construct byTibetans that is not found in India. The two do not differ with regard to ultimatereality but just employ varying approaches to explain the scriptures.782Longchen Rabjampa, in three of his seven Treasuretexts, discusses the dis-tinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists, explicitly affirming the lat-ter as the supreme system in the sÒtra vehicle.783The fourteenth-century Kadampa master Üba Losal784also employs the abovethreefold classification but puts Jñ›nagarbha together with Candrakırti into thecategory of Centrists who follow common worldly consensus.785Distinct fromthis classification, he also uses the Autonomist-Consequentialist division, withJñ›nagarbha as an Autonomist.The most prolific writer of Tibetan history, Bodong Pa ̊chen Choglay Nam-gyal786(1376–1451), divides Centrists into two branches:1) those who follow reasoning2) those who follow common worldly consensus (N›g›rjuna, firyadeva, Can-drakırti, and ⁄›ntideva)The first branch has four subdivisions:1) those who accord with the Followers of the Great Exposition, such as firya -vimuktisena2) those who accord with the SÒtra Followers, such as Bh›vaviveka3) those who accord with the Yog›c›ras, such as ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, KamalaŸıla, andHaribhadra4) those who accord with and follow common worldly consensus, such asJñ›nagarbhaNeither of the two still available works of the important historian Gö Lots›wa(1392–1481)—his Commentary on The Sublime Continuumand The Blue Annals—refers to any subschools of Centrism.787The chapter in The Blue Annalson thespreading of the Centrist teachings in Tibet does not even mention Buddhap›litaor Bh›vaviveka. In the context of the lineage of Ngog Lots›wa, Gö Lots›wa justremarks that Chaba Chökyi Senge wrote many refutations of the works of Can-drakırti, while Tsang Nagba Dsöndrü Senge “followed the method of Can-drakırti” and Majaba Jangchub Dsöndrü “preferred the system of Jay›nanda.”788The exposition of the basic texts by Candrakırti in Tibet is explained to haveoriginated with Patsab Lots›wa and his followers.789Karmapa Mikyö Dorje defines and uses the distinction between AutonomistsThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 339Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 339"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"and Consequentialists in a rather narrow sense. He equates the former with “thosewho establish illusions through reasoning.” (This is discussed further below.)In all of these distinctions by early authors, it is to be noted, none of them pre-sented the Centrists of SÒtras and the Centrists of Yoga Practice as subdivisionsof the Autonomists. The first scriptural evidence for classifying these two as sub-schools of the Autonomists is found in a Bon text on philosophical systems790from the early fourteenth century. Like Butön, the text equates the Centrists fol-lowing common worldly consensus with the Consequentialists. Since this is aBon text, one would naturally assume that also the subclassification of Autono-mists was taken from Buddhist precursors, but we do not have any such evidencein earlier Buddhist texts. In presently available Buddhist works, this subclassifi-cation implicitly starts to show in Tsongkhapa’s Elucidation of the Intention791(his commentary on The Entrance into Centrism) and the writings of his studentKedrub Geleg Balsang792(1385–1438). It is explicitly stated by Sera Jetsün ChökyiGyaltsen (1469–1546) and nearly all subsequent Gelugpa masters. Later, the ter-minology of “Autonomist Centrists who follow the SÒtras”793and “AutonomistCentrists of Yoga Practice”794became more or less universally accepted by all fourschools of Tibetan Buddhism.One should be aware, however, that these terms combine two classificationschemes on two different levels: The one (SÒtra versus Yog›c›ra) is a distinctionas to how seeming reality is presented, while the other (Autonomists versus Con-sequentialists) pertains to the approach to Centrist reasoning. Also, as can beseen above, initially these two classifications were absolutely limited to these tworespective levels (seeming reality and reasoning) and clearly kept apart, whereaslater they were turned into names for actual Centrist subschools, which includedmore or less extensive elaborations on additional differences on a number of otherlevels too.This account shows clearly that for centuries there was no universal agree-ment, in either India or Tibet, as to whether or how to classify Indian Centristmasters. In India, it was a long time before there were any indications of Centrismbecoming divided into two branches, and even then it was a rather loose division.In Tibet, the most common early distinction seems to have been into the Cen-trists of SÒtras and the Centrists of Yoga Practice. More elaborate distinctions,including the one into Autonomists and Consequentialists, clearly only developedlater and coexisted or were combined with the earlier ones. Among these, evi-dently, the Autonomist-Consequentialist division was not regarded as themaindistinction by any author before Tsongkhapa.In India, the Autonomist approach in terms of reasoning was far more com-mon among later Centrists. Most major masters after Bh›vaviveka activelyemployed it, and nobody but Candrakırti and Jay›nanda objected to it. Thus,there is no evidence at all that the Consequentialist approach was generally con-340The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 340"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"sidered any better than the Autonomist one. In fact, the texts of those Centristswho later came to be labeled Autonomists enjoyed widespread high esteem. Inparticular, Candrakırti’s critique of Bh›vaviveka is never even mentioned in anyother Indian Centrist texts. He is hardly ever quoted in any of them,795and thereis only a single known commentary on his works by Jay›nanda as late as theeleventh century.796Thus, Candrakırti’s criticism, which only became considereda devastating attack on Autonomism many centuries later by Tibetan and West-ern interpreters, simply went largely unnoticed in India. Rather, everything indi-cates that Candrakırti’s place in Indian Buddhism was rather limited. He wasdefinitely not the towering figure in Centrism that he later became in Tibet, butbasically just one Centrist master among many others (to be sure, this is not todeny that he was an outstanding scholar and highly realized being). In brief,there is no evidence at all that Candrakırti’s approach ever dominated the IndianCentrist scene. One can speak even less about a distinct school of Consequen-tialists; the only two Indian masters ever to explicitly favor the use of conse-quences over autonomous reasoning were Candrakırti himself and—muchlater—Jay›nanda.797T Refutation of Mistaken Assumptions about Autonomists and ConsequentialistsIn his Chariot of the Tagbo Siddhas, the Eighth Karmapa portrays a number ofcommon Tibetan claims—”well known as the wind”—as to the distinctionbetween Autonomists and Consequentialists:7981) Autonomists accept (a) the perceptual and inferential valid cognitions of ordi-nary people799as correct valid cognitions. (b) They accept them as being valid cog-nitions that operate through the power of (real) entities. (c) On the basis of thisacceptance, such valid cognitions are not just seen as the assertions of others butare established through the experiences in the Autonomists’ own continua. Byrelying on these accepted valid cognitions, they affirmatively prove emptinessand negate its opposites.2) Phrased in terms of the Autonomists’ acceptance of these three features of validcognition (a–c) as the basis for negation and proof, the Consequentialists in gen-eral (a) do not accept any valid cognition as the basis for negation and proof withregard to emptiness, nonarising, and such. (b) Even if they accept such valid cog-nition, they do not accept any valid cognition that operates through the powerof entities. (c) And even if they accept a valid cognition that operates through thepower of entities, they do not have any autonomous valid cognition. Even in thisThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 341Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 341"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"case, any valid cognition as the basis for negation and proof with regard to themeaning of emptiness is solely based on what is acknowledged by others.3) Autonomists debate in accordance with the presentation of correct and seem-ing negations and proofs in the system of Dign›ga and Dharmakırti, while Con-sequentialists do not debate in accordance with their presentation. For if theydebated in accordance with negations and proofs used in a system of proponentsof real entities, they would also incur the flaw of being such realists. Instead,Consequentialists have their special presentation of negations and proofs thatthe proponents of real entities do not have. This presentation consists of fiveelements: (a) inference acknowledged by others, (b) consequences that expose contradic-tions, (c) analogous applicability of the opponent’s reason, (d) nonapplication ofthe means of proof due to presupposing the probandum,800and (e) not having anautonomous position.801The first four are said to be like weapons to vanquish thetheses of others and the fifth to be like armor to protect one’s own thesis. On this,the writings of Patsab Lots›wa’s disciple Shang Tangsagba are quoted:Consequences that expose contradictions and analogous applicabilityof the opponent’s reason are the reasonings that, like Vi ̋ ̊u’s spear,invalidate the theses of others. Nonapplication of the means of proofdue to presupposing the probandum is the armorlike reasoning to pro-tect one’s own thesis by giving the lack of a thesis of one’s own thename of “a thesis of one’s own.” Inference acknowledged by others isthe refereelike reasoning that makes the two opponents be in unison.The Karmapa analyzes each of these statements as presented here below.1a) As for the perceptual and inferential valid cognitions of ordinary people,Autonomist masters give presentations of valid cognitions that are presumed tobe ordinary people’s own valid cognitions from the perspective of just these ordi-nary people themselves. However, Autonomists do not accept that such validcognitions are correct valid cognitions in the Centrist system. As Bh›vaviveka’sBlaze of Reasoningmakes clear:The Blessed One taught the two realities by giving presentations of thenature and characteristics of phenomena on the seeming level whilesaying that ultimately they lack a nature:342The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 342"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"KauŸika, all phenomena are empty of nature. That all phenom-ena are empty of nature means that entities do not exist. Thatentities do not exist is the perfection of knowledge.In accord with many such statements, if even entities as such do notexist, forget about any nature of theirs. Therefore, there is no invalida-tion [of the lack of nature] through our accepting [entities such as thefive aggregates that were expediently taught by the Buddha]. There isalso no invalidation through perception. Since objects are false and thesense faculties foolish, seeing has no [epistemic] power. Like the appear-ance of floating hairs, bees, and flies to someone with blurred vision, oran echo and so on, perception too is just obvious self-indulgence. . . .There is also no invalidation through common consensus, since [theeyes of] the world are covered by the membrane of ignorance. Conse-quently, in the situation of analyzing for the ultimate, since [the world]does not realize the [ultimate], there is no invalidation through [theworld’s] common consensus, just as [experts in] examining preciousgems [are not affected by] the examinations of blind people.802KamalaŸıla’s Illumination of True Realitysays:Since falsities that are like dreams and suchAre undeceiving in terms of the desired purpose,Conventionally, it should be saidThat there is valid cognition for worldly entities.But how could this be ultimate?It is nothing but a name and [thus] not to be removed.Among what occurs for ordinary people,Who could possibly remove [anything, so why] this?803If, in actuality, there is no perceptual valid cognition, there is also no inferen-tial valid cognition, since all valid cognitions primarily depend on whether thereis an establishment through perception. In particular, Autonomists declare thatthe minds and mental events of ordinary people that are regarded as valid cog-nitions by common consensus entail conceptuality (which is the cause forbondage) but are definitely not actual valid cognitions. As Jñ›nagarbha’s Dis-tinction between the Two Realitiessays:Minds and mental events in the three realmsAre conceptuality that involves the aspect of superimposition.The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 343Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 343"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"[The Buddha] expressed them in just the wayIn which he saw them as the very cause for bondage.804In brief, Autonomists validate ordinary people’s cognitions only insofar astheir appearance for these very people is concerned, but not by regarding such val-idation as a part of the Centrist system, let alone validating any kind of ultimateexistence.1b) As for the Autonomists’ acceptance of a valid cognition that operates throughthe power of entities, it is a great flaw not to precisely discriminate the distinc-tive features of such acceptance. “Valid cognition that operates through the powerof entities” is usually explained as follows. The aspect that an entity performs afunction means that it performs a function through the power of the very natureof this intrinsically real entity without being dependent on anything else. The per-formance of a function in this sense is also intrinsically real, and an intrinsicallyreal valid cognition in this sense is said to be a valid cognition that operatesthrough the power of entities. This characterizes the acceptance of this kind ofvalid cognition as found in Dharmakırti’s Commentary on Valid Cognition. Hisvalid cognition through the power of entities that negates both the apprehend-ing and apprehended aspects of consciousness reads as follows:Once the entities [of apprehender and apprehended] are analyzed by this,In true reality, they do not exist as entities,Because they do not have a natureOf unity or multiplicity.“In whatever ways referents are reflected upon,In just these ways they are free [from being such referents].”What the learned thus declareResults from the power of entities.805As Centrists, Autonomists do not accept any real existence of entities. So if theabove intrinsically real entities and valid cognitions that operate through thepower of these entities were accepted by Autonomists,806all their efforts in study-ing, reflecting, and meditating would be pointless. So would their activities ofexplaining, debating, and composing texts to the effect of showing that all phe-nomena are empty of a nature of their own and not established as intrinsically real.1c) It is not justified to say that Autonomists establish emptiness as their ownexperience and that they express this experience solely through the above validcognitions that are part of their own system,807while not expressing it in any344The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 344"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"other way. Not only Consequentialists but also Autonomists express the experi-ence of profound emptiness in their own minds as the “nonrealization of theprofound actuality of emptiness” and say that this profound actuality is beyondbeing an object of cognition. As Bh›vaviveka’sHeart of Centrismdeclares:Once the mind turns away fromConceptuality and the lack of conceptuality,Since the mind is without object then,It is the very peace in which discursiveness is at utter peace.808The Distinction between the Two Realitiessays:Since there is nothing to be negated,It is clear that actually there is no negation.How should the negation of an imputation’sOwn nature not be an imputation?Hence, seemingly, this isThe meaning of actuality, but not actuality [itself].In actuality, neither exists.This is the lack of discursiveness:MañjuŸrı asked about actuality,And the son of the Victors remained silent.809⁄›ntarak ̋ita’s Ornament of Centrismstates:Since arising and so forth do not exist,Nonarising and so on are impossible.810Therefore, it is clear that Autonomists accept emptiness as being free from speech,thought, and expression. If they did not accept it in this way, who in their rightmind could call them Centrists?8112a) The claim that Consequentialists generally do not even provisionally acceptany valid cognition as the basis for negation and proof from the perspective of thedisciples, and that they therefore do not express any such valid cognition, is notjustified. In his Lucid Words, Candrakırti defeats all Buddhist and non-Buddhistopponents by accepting the presentation of all four types of valid cognition thatfunction as the basis for negation and proof (perception, inference, verbal testi-mony, and analogy)812and by commenting on them in detail.The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 345Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 345"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"2b) Specifically, Candrakırti does not assert that any phenomena are establishedin the sense of operating through the power of real entities on either of the twolevels of reality. However, when he engages in negation and proof, in accordancewith the common consensus in the world and learned treatises that all entities per-form their functions through their own intrinsic power, he expresses things in away that follows what is acknowledged by others. It is only in this way that heextensively refutes others by means of valid cognition that operates through thepower of entities. For example, take the consequence that it is pointless for some-thing to repeatedly arise from itself when it already exists. For people withunquestioning worldly minds, this consequence works precisely and only throughtheir assumption of the power of real entities. In order for the Enumerators tounderstand such a consequence of their own position, Candrakırti formulates itin the above way and thus refutes that anything arises from itself. In this way,there are infinite such pronouncements by Consequentialists for the sake of inval-idating all other such reasonings brought up by their opponents based on the lat-ter’s assumption of real entities with a power of their own.2c) As a heartfelt position of their own, Consequentialists certainly never acceptany probandum or means of proof that is grounded in any kind of real entity.However, from the perspective of others to be trained and in adaptation to whatis acknowledged by others, in their very own words, both Buddhap›lita and Can-drakırti extensively formulate the triad of subject, predicate, and reason in termsof an autonomous probandum and means of proof. For example, in the thir-teenth chapter of his Lucid Words, Candrakırti formulates an autonomous pro-bative argument:Since they do not have a nature as they [seem], all conditioned phe-nomena are delusive, because they have the property of being deceiv-ing, just like the water of a mirage. Whatever is real is not somethingthat has the property of being deceiving, for example, nirv› ̊a.813So how is this formulated as an autonomous probative argument? Taking “allconditioned phenomena” as the subject, “are delusive” is the predicate of whatis to be proven, and “because they are deceiving” represents the subject property.“Since they do not have a nature as they [seem]” shows that the reason of beingdeceiving applies to the subject in question. “The water of a mirage” is the exam-ple for the positive entailment of the predicate by the reason. “Whatever is realis not something that has the property of being deceiving” refers to the negativeentailment (that is, the total absence of the reason in the opposite of the predi-cate), and “for example, nirv› ̊a” illustrates this negative entailment.Furthermore, from the perspective of others, Consequentialists doformulate346The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 346"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"the autonomous three modes of a reason. If they did not formulate them, evenConsequentialists would not be able to generate in others an inference acknowl-edged by these others. The first chapter of The Lucid Wordsstates what inferen-tial cognition is:The consciousness that has a hidden object and arises from a reasonthat is unmistaken with regard to the probandum is inference.814Here, the word “reason” refers to the subject property, and to say that it “isunmistaken with regard to the probandum” is the acceptance of the positive andnegative entailment.One might object, “These are not the autonomous three modes but the threemodes that are acknowledged by others. Thus, through stating them in a way ofaccepting them as acknowledged by others, Consequentialists are able to gener-ate inferential valid cognition in disciples.” For a reasoning to be an autonomousreasoning, the Eighth Karmapa says, it does not matter whether others acceptsuch three modes or not. When a debater generates an inferential cognition inanother debater in such a way that the first debater himself or herself pronouncesthe three modes, then these three modes are autonomously or independentlypronounced as such by the first debater and not in dependence on others.815Therefore, for Centrists, there are no three modes that are established through theCentrists’ own system in the sense of an actual opinion of their own. However,when Centrists refute others in such a way that they themselves pronounce whatis acknowledged by others as valid cognition with the three modes, it is obviousthat they merely formulate something that has the three modes and is pro-nounced in this autonomous or independent way.The gist of this is that we can distinguish between a mere nominal systemof one’s own in discourse and the general lack of an actual Centrist system ofits own:First, Centrists may be said to employ a rhetorical system of their own in thesense of what is explicitly expressed by the very words of Centrist debaters who ver-balize what is suitable to be common consensus—that is, the subject property andso on in reasonings to invalidate others that appear in the minds of these Centriststhemselves—whether this is already acknowledged by other debaters or not.At the same time, Centrists lack any presentation of a Centrist system of theirown that reflects their actual opinion on things. This is because any opinion oftheir own that they may express in the above ways as to a subject property andso on is not at all established on either of the two levels of reality through anyvalid cognition that is part of a Centrist system of their own.A “system of their own” as expressed in the first way is voiced by Centrists asa mere nominal pronouncement of “a system of their own.” It is not a systemThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 347Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 347"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"of their own with a certain meaning as its object to be expressed. If it were,there would be the flaw that Centrists have a system of their own, while it is thewhole point of Centrism to eliminate any system building. At the same time, anyattempt to refute the verbal statements of their opponents without at least voic-ing some nominal or rhetorical pronouncement of the three modes and such as“a system that is autonomously pronounced by Centrist debaters themselves” isonly absurd. In other words, without saying anything, any possibility of evenstarting to debate with others is out of question. However, through their ownmouths, Centrists dopronounce subject properties and so on, as found in theconsequence “It follows that the arising of a vase is pointless, because it existsalready” that is directed at those who assert that things arise from themselves.When Centrists pronounce this, it is indubitable that this is their system to putan end to the wrong ideas of others in the context of debate. Therefore, it is nottrue that Consequentialists themselves never voice the three modes as they areacknowledged by others as their own pronouncement for the sake of refuting thewrong ideas of others in debate. Otherwise, when Consequentialists and realistsdebate, that which makes the Consequentialist responses would have to be someinanimate sound.816This is the absurd consequence of the claim that Conse-quentialists are beyond any system of voicing their own pronouncements, forthis means that the only possible activity of responding in a debate would haveto be through pronouncements that are not brought about by any effort ofbeings.Thus, in the context of debate, there are two kinds of “own system”:• an own system in the sense of explicit words being voiced as the debater’s ownpronouncement• an own system in the sense of declaring some actual opinion of one’s own tobe a distinct philosophical system by way of this very system.Taking it for granted that Consequentialists do not assert the second kind ofsystem, through verbally pronouncing the first kind of “own system,” they voiceautonomously made pronouncements. Voiced in this way, this does not amountto presenting an autonomous own system. Thus, it is definitely suitable for Con-sequentialists to personally voice their own three modes.In brief, even for Consequentialists, there is no problem with employing pro-bative arguments per se or because they entail the three modes. This kind of rea-soning is only inadmissible for Centrists if some sort of underlying ontology,epistemological grounding, or thesis in such reasoning is assumed as being estab-lished as part of one’s own system.817Conversely, the use of consequences in general is not a problem for Autono-mists (not even for Bhvaviveka), as their texts amply show. In his Commentary on348The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 348"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"The Ornament of Centrism, KamalaŸıla even says that the exclusive use of conse-quences in certain contexts is fine:As for [notions that refer to] some intrinsic nature of entities, are notcommon consensus, and are [just] imputed by others (such as space [asan entity that performs a function]), [they can be disproved] by adduc-ing consequences alone. As for some intrinsic nature of [entities] thatis common consensus, there is no flaw [in negating it] in both ways[through consequences and probative arguments], since others acceptthat all entities are [included] in the two sets of permanent and imper-manent phenomena.818The above passages show clearly that the way in which the distinction betweenAutonomists and Consequentialists is drawn hinges on what exactly is under-stood by “autonomous,” be it in terms of reasoning or a thesis. Obviously, thereis quite a variety in different masters’ views, ranging from the Gelugpa “onto-logical extreme” of autonomous reasoning (entailing the three modes that aregrounded in specifically characterized phenomena established through conven-tional valid cognition even for oneself) to the more “pragmatic extreme” thatautonomous reasoning more or less means any probative argument with the threemodes that is pronounced by merely following common logical consensus.Another common claim is: “When Consequentialists engage in negation andproof, they must solely pronounce arguments as expressed by others, whereasthey may not pronounce any reasonings of their own.” This cannot categoricallybe said to be the position of Consequentialists, since Candrakırti explains thefollowing: Consequentialists may find themselves in situations in which they arenot able to refute others through the obviously defective and insufficient argu-ments of these others (if these arguments were correct, Consequentialists wouldnot attack them in the first place). In such cases, they must defeat the inconsis-tencies of others by employing justified reasonings that properly address theseinconsistencies, and they must do so by formulating these reasonings in just theway that they appear in the minds of the Centrists themselves. Otherwise, if Cen-trists simply hoped that defective arguments would invalidate others and thenvoiced such arguments themselves, they would just be affected by the same flawsas their opponents. In other words, it is impossible to defeat defective argumentswith these very arguments or other defective ones. Rather, it has to be clearlydemonstrated that and how such arguments are defective, which is possible onlythrough other, correct arguments that are not part of the opponents’ flawedrepertory. As the ninth chapter of Candrakırti’s commentary on firyadeva’s FourHundred Versessays:The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 349Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 349"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Here, the opponents impute infinitesimal particles of earth, water, fire,and wind that do not possess arising and ceasing. Since they do nothave any cause, just like a sky-flower, they do not have any existence.To establish these nonexistents as being impermanent through estab-lishing their arising by [first] superimposing existence onto them isnot reasonable, because an actual object that is a result is not estab-lished for oneself, and it is extremely absurd to accept something estab-lished for others as [one’s own] argument. Since the opponents mustbe refuted by their accepting that entities are unreasonable [altogether],it is also not reasonable to accept something permanent as an actualobject that is a result. Hence, [in such a case,] it is not reasonable toinfer something from the position of others or to expose [its internal]contradictions, because [these two options] are solely expressedthrough something that is established for both [parties]. In any case,[some people] hold, “Since it is impossible to invalidate [the positionsof others] by way of something that is established for both [realistsand Centrists], invalidation comes about through an inference by whatis established for oneself [only].” [However,] this just amounts to lackof skill in demonstrating the meaning. Those who are skilled do notdemonstrate, through something difficult, a meaning that is easilydemonstrated.819The Karmapa explains the meaning of this passage. The Differentiators claimthat the atoms of the four elements are unarisen and permanent. To answer thisby saying, “They are arisen, because they are causes” and thus trying to prove theirimpermanence by way of establishing their arising is not reasonable. Since theatoms of the four elements that are imputed by others are not suitable as reallyexisting entities in the first place, it is explained here that the subject in questionis not established at all.820Based on the subject being unestablished, it is notestablished for the Centrists themselves that it is a cause that could have an actualresult. Therefore, this cannot serve as an argument. If Centrists accepted some-thing that is established for others as an argument despite its not being establishedfor themselves, this would be very absurd. If one thinks that Centrists intend tocounteract the systems of opponents through temporarily accepting somethingthat is only established for others, one has to see that, generally, accepting some-thing that is unreasonable and in this way wishing to put an end to the mis-takenness of others is in itself very unreasonable. Some say, “As for expressing aninvalidation of others, one needs something that is acknowledged through com-mon consensus for both, since one is not able to generate a completely pure validcognition in the continua of others through a statement that utterly lacks any cer-tainty for oneself. It is necessary to generate definitive certainty about the mean-350The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 350"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"ing of such an invalidation in the opponents and thus to eliminate their wrongideas precisely through this certainty.” However, this just describes the kind ofdefective arguments that are acknowledged by others. Since there are many sit-uations in which one, from the perspective of others, is not able to put an end totheir wrong ideas through such defective arguments, it makes no sense to applythem in these situations. This is an essential point.There are other times when it is not reasonable to use such defective argu-ments. For example, when Centrists themselves defend the Buddhist philosoph-ical system and in this process refute non-Buddhists by verbally employingsomething that corresponds to what other, inferior Buddhist proponents say,they would denigrate what is established for Buddhists if they were to take the rea-sonings of non-Buddhists as valid cognition. Another example of this is the con-text of Centrists debating with Buddhist realists. Here, for those realists, there isno valid cognition acknowledged by others, let alone any autonomous valid cog-nition, that can prove really existing phenomena (such as the five aggregates).Hence, in all these cases, it is not reasonable for Centrists to accept any kind ofvalid cognition acknowledged by others. This is also explained in the sixteenthchapter of Candrakırti’s commentary on firyadeva’s Four Hundred Verses:Those who state the reasonableness of emptiness do not accept anyarguments that are common consensus in other scriptural traditions,because they wish to demonstrate precisely the unreasonableness ofthese very scriptural traditions of others. Whenever debaters have aconcordant view, both accept it as having a certain [identical] mean-ing. It is through this [acceptance] that it is suitable as valid cognition[for them], since logicians solely embrace meanings or philosophicalsystems that possess justification.821When proponent and opponent debate about the suchness of all phenomena,through reasoning, they must both engage solely in such objects for which noinvalidation through valid cognition is visible. But if they just speak out of cling-ing to the real existence of their own respective theses that they accept as validcognition acknowledged by either themselves or others, there is neither victorynor defeat. Thus, whatever being engaged in the suchness of all things may be,it is definitely not the understanding of such debaters.3) It is also claimed that “Consequentialists never debate in accordance with nega-tion and proof in the system of Dign›ga and Dharmakırti” and that “Conse-quentialists accept the five uncommon features of negation and proof, such asconsequences that expose contradictions.” These two claims contradict each otherperfectly. To repeat, the five features are: The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 351Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 351"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"a) inference acknowledged by othersb) consequences that expose contradictionsc) analogous applicability of the opponent’s reasond) nonapplication of the means of proof due to presupposing the probandume) not having an autonomous position3a) From among these five, inference acknowledged by others is found in thesystem of Dign›ga and Dharmakırti, because it is the implicit proof by a conse-quence822that is able to generate an inference in the opponent. For example,Dharmakırti says, “Whatever is connected to a multiplicity, is necessarily not aunity. Just as in the case of juniper in relation to different containers, you acceptthat also the generality “cattle” (which you consider to be a unity) is connectedwith a multiplicity of its own instances.”8233b) Consequences that expose contradictions are explained in the system ofDign›ga and Dharmakırti as the correct consequences that refute the theses ofothers.8243c–d) The analogous applicability of the opponent’s reason and the nonapplica-tion of the means of proof due to presupposing the probandum are explained byDign›ga and Dharmakırti as the answers in response to an opponent’s seeminginvalidation.825The two features (c) and (d) respectively demonstrate that theentailment and the reason are not established.Thus, the claim that “the Consequentialist way of negation and proof is otherthan the system of Dign›ga and Dharmakırti” is unfounded.With regard to the purpose of the four ways of reasoning (a–d above) in Con-sequentialism, The Treasury of Knowledgequotes ⁄›kya Chogden’s explanation:Through (b) consequences that expose contradictions, one countersthe reasons that others accept with their unwanted consequences.Through (c) the analogous applicability of the [opponent’s] reason,one produces certainty about the entailment of these consequences forthe mental perspective of the other party through examples. Through(d) [the nonapplication of] the means of proof due to presupposing theprobandum, one demonstrates that others are not able to iron out sucha counter with [unwanted] consequences. Through these three conse-quences (b–d), one proves the subject property and the entailment,which are acknowledged by others, for the mental perspective of theopposing party. Following that, through (a) arguments acknowledgedby others, an inferential valid cognition is generated within the per-spective of others.826352The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 352"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"To illustrate how Consequentialists may use these four kinds of reasoning, theirapplication to negating the four possibilities of arising shall be demonstrated.First, the Enumerators accept that things (A) arise from themselves. They say:“Only such things that exist already at the time of their causes arise, whereas pre-viously nonexistent things never arise. For example, sesame oil comes forth fromsesame seeds, because it already existed in them. The reason it does not comeforth from sand is that it does not exist in sand.”In order to negate this, the above four reasonings ([a] through [d]) are used asfollows:(b) The consequence that exposes contradictions says: “For things as the sub-ject, it follows that their arising is meaningless, because they are already presentat the time of their causes.”The opponents might say, “The reason does not entail the predicate.”827Now,(c) the opponent’s reason is applied in an analogous manner: “Then it followsthat the arising of things is endless, because —according to your objection—they can still arise, although they are already present.”They might continue, “There are two phases in the process of arising that arenot the same. It is the vase in its state of being a lump of clay that arises, but thevase that is already clearly manifest does not, of course, arise again. Therefore,there is a difference between these two states of the vase in that it is either clearlymanifest or not.” The answer to this is (d) the nonapplication of this means ofproof due to presupposing its initial probandum: “According to your initial posi-tion, the vase that is not clearly manifest in its state of being a lump of clay is alsoexistent. “828Finally, there follows (a) the inference acknowledged by others: “Therefore,inner and outer things as the subject do not arise from themselves, because—according to you—they exist already.”Second, there are many Buddhists and non-Buddhists who accept (B) arisingfrom something other, such as that a sprout arises from a seed or a consciousnessfrom its object.(b) The consequence that exposes contradictions says: “From this it followsthat seed and sprout are not something other through their respective natures,because the sprout arises from the seed.” If the opponents say, “ The reason does not entail the predicate,” (c) the oppo-nent’s reason is applied in an analogous manner: “Then it follows that deep dark-ness can originate even from bright flames, because—according to yourobjection—something can arise from a cause that is something other than itsresult through their respective natures.”They may object, “But there is a difference as to whether the capacity to makeThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 353Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 353"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"the result arise exists in the cause or not.” There follows (d) the nonapplicationof this means of proof due to presupposing its probandum: “Your objection pre-supposes your initial probandum that the sprout arises from something other,because—even if this capacity to give rise to the result exists in the cause—thisdoes not change anything in cause and result still being something other.”Finally, we come to (a) the inference acknowledged by others: “Therefore, asprout does not arise from a seed, because—according to you—seed and sproutare something other through their respective natures.”Third, the Jainas assert that things (C) arise both from themselves and from some-thing other. They say, “That a clay vase arises from itself means that it arises fromthe nature of clay. That it arises from something other means that it arises dueto a potter, water, and so on.” The negation of this position does not go throughthe above four steps. Rather, it is already implicitly refuted through the abovenegations of things arising from themselves (A) or from something other (B),since it is nothing but the sum of the fallacies of possibilities (A) and (B).Finally, others assert that the world and its beings (D) arise without a cause.(b) The consequence that exposes contradictions says, “It follows that thisworld as the subject is not directly perceptible, because it does not have a cause.”If the opponents say, “ The reason does not entail the predicate,” (c) the oppo-nent’s reason is applied in an analogous manner: “Then it follows that even aflower in the sky can be perceived, because—according to your objection—it issomething that can be perceived, although it does not have a cause.”They may argue, “In these two cases, there is a difference as to whether a givenphenomenon has a nature or not.” There follows (d) the nonapplication of thismeans of proof due to presupposing its probandum: “This presupposes your ini-tial probandum, because the result—even if it has a nature—is still somethingwithout a cause.”Finally, (a) the inference acknowledged by others states, “Therefore, this worldas the subject is not something that arises without a cause, because it arises some-times.”829(3e) The fifth feature above—the claim that Consequentialists, in their own sys-tem, do not have a position—is not suitable as a distinctive feature of the Con-sequentialists’ own system, because Consequentialists are free from saying,thinking, and expressing things like “This is our own system.” Consequently,they do not mentally or verbally conceptualize, “We do not have a position.”In his Commentary on The Ten Verses on True Reality, Sahajavajra says thatsince there is no valid cognition, it is difficult to find entities that are to be provenor serve as means of proof. All of them are just seeming, not ultimate.

Otherwise, one is not able todefeat what is unreasonable or to confirm what is reasonable. To merely followthis system does not mean that valid cognitions or their objects become estab-lished by their nature on either level of the two realities. Rather, it is like tem-porarily giving extensive presentations of outer referents for certain expedientpurposes, while subsequently entirely uprooting any notions of such referentsthrough progressively superior reasonings.830The Eighth Karmapa also mentions certain Tibetan doxographies that distin-guish Autonomists and Consequentialists on the basis that Autonomists assert thedistinction between the correct and the false seeming, while Consequentialists donot.831Some people also say that this distinction exists as part of the Conse-quentialists’ own system too, and some that it does not even conventionally existin the latter’s system.However, all of these positions are unfounded. The Autonomists’ own systemtoo does not make the slightest difference in terms of being correct or falsebetween appearances at daytime and appearances in a dream or between twodream appearances. Like Consequentialists, Autonomists also make this distinc-tion not as part of their own system but only in accordance with common worldlyconsensus. This is expressed by Bh›vaviveka in his Lamp of Knowledge:All phenomena are equal to nirv› ̊a. However, in order to realize theultimate, many accumulations [of merit must be] gathered. Therefore,in accordance with this [purpose] and because it is [considered to be]the case in worldly conventions, [it may be said that] outer and innerentities are something correct in common worldly consensus. [How-ever,] it is known that, actually, they are not correct. It [only] refers tothe conventional level when it is said that “everything may be corrector false.” The same is expressed by the Blessed One:Whatever is known as existent in the world, that I too declare asexistent. Whatever is known as nonexistent in the world, that Itoo declare as nonexistent.832Jñ›nagarbha’s Distinction between the Two Realitiessays:Although [phenomena] are similar in appearance,Since they are able to perform functions or not,They are correct or false.In this way, the division of the seeming is made.The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 355Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 355"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"We even assert nonexistents to be effective,Just in accordance with the way they are imputed.[Buddhas] do not see existents as effectiveIn any way whatsoever.833His autocommentary explains:They are deceiving or undeceiving with regard to performing the func-tion that corresponds to the way they appear. Having ascertained this,worldly people cognize water and such as correct and mirages and suchas false. Actually, however, both are completely alike in their nature inthat they lack any nature. . . . To be deceiving or undeceiving withregard to performing a function is just how this is according to com-mon consensus, because such [being deceiving or undeceiving] lacksany nature too.834⁄›ntarak ̋ita’s subcommentary elaborates: One might wonder, “If distinct phenomena that are correct and falseexist, then entities do not lack a nature.” The answer to this is “Actu-ally, both are completely alike.” “How are they alike?” In that theylack any nature.835If it were not that correct and false seeming phenomena equally lack anynature, how could it be justified that Autonomists, by using many examples fordelusive things (such as illusions and dreams), prove that all phenomena are with-out nature? If all seeming phenomena did not equally lack a nature, such exam-ples and the meaning to which they refer (the lack of nature) would be completelydissimilar. Furthermore, Autonomists explain again and again that all illusionlikephenomena of the seeming lack any really or ultimately established nature. AsKamalaŸıla’s Stages of Meditationsays:Although what has causes is ultimately delusive, it simply arises, justlike an illusion, a reflection, or an echo. On the level of the seeming,illusions and such dependently originate, but since they do not with-stand examination, ultimately they are not existent entities.836Hence, it makes no sense to claim the possibility of conventionally establish-ing this illusionlike seeming through conventionally valid reasoning, since bothwhat is to be proven and the means to prove it lack any nature. So what shouldbe proved through what?356The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 356"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Some people argue, “But Autonomists assert that seeming reality is establishedfrom the conventional perspective through conventional valid cognition, becausethey assert that the horses and elephants that are conjured up by an illusionist areestablished from the perspective of the visual consciousness that is affected by theillusionist’s tricks through this visual consciousness itself. So why would they notassert that seeming reality is actually established in their own system?” Autono-mists do not assert this, since there is no entailment in the above argument. Inhis Lucid Words, Candrakırti has pointed out that if Autonomists were to saysomething like this, they would say something in which there is not only noentailment but entailment to the contrary. In other words, it is unreasonable tosay, “Illusionlike seeming reality is both the means of proof and what is to beproven conventionally through conventional valid cognition, that is, correct rea-soning.” For it is said at the same time that all illusionlike phenomena do not havea nature that is actually or ultimately or really established. In his critique ofBh›vaviveka, Candrakırti shows that in all the inferences in which Bh›vavivekastates reasons or subjects that are treated as real entities established through con-ventional valid cognition, it is precisely on Bh›vaviveka’s own account that suchreasons and subjects are neither established for himself (ultimately) nor estab-lished for his realist opponents (as mere seeming entities). Since his reasons arethus not reasons that are acknowledged as commonly appearing to both debaters,what is to be proven—profound true reality—and all means of proof collapse.837One might think, “Since Autonomists state that `ultimately or actually, allphenomena are not established,’ why would they have to say that phenomena arenot established conventionally?” Consequentialists say that this qualm does notmake sense. If phenomena do not have any reality actually or ultimately (whichis an all-inclusive qualifier), then they are not established through valid cognitionconventionally either, just like the appearance of floating hairs for those withblurred vision.The Karmapa says that it is due to Candrakırti’s extensive refutation of this fea-ture of conventionally valid establishment in the Autonomist system that it seemsthat Centrists divided into the two great traditions of “Autonomists” and “Con-sequentialists.” Therefore, he holds that the main difference between Autono-mists and Consequentialists comes down to nothing but this. Based on thisassertion by Autonomists, some Autonomist masters asserted that certain con-ventional phenomena (such as the ground consciousness) conventionally exist assomething validly established through conventional valid cognition, while oth-ers asserted that they do not exist. Candrakırti’s refutation is then directed onlyagainst those who assert such existence.In summary, the way that Autonomists assert the correct and false seeming isnot different from the Consequentialist way of asserting these, because both typesof seeming reality equally exist as mere unexamined appearances, and bothThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 357Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 357"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"equally do not exist once they are analyzed. This is clearly expressed by bothAutonomists and Consequentialists. Of course, such masters as N›g›rjuna andCandrakırti are well known for this stance of no analysis with regard to the seem-ing. It is, however, quite common among Centrists who are usually consideredAutonomists too. For example, in his autocommentary on verse 21 of The Dis-tinction between the Two Realities, Jñ›nagarbha says:The seeming is just as it appears. In this, there is nothing to be analyzedas it was explained [above with Centrist reasoning] . . . . We do notanalyze this, but stop any performance of analysis . . . . Once the seem-ing just as it appears is analyzed, one arrives at something different.Therefore, only invalidation will come about.838Also ⁄›ntarak ̋ita’s Ornament of Centrismincludes “being unexamined” amongthe criteria of what is the seeming:What satisfies only when unexamined,Has the features of arising and ceasing,And is able to perform functionsIs realized as being the seeming.839⁄rıgupta’s Commentary on Entering True Reality840agrees, and Bh›vaviveka’s JewelLamp of Centrismuses nearly the same words:Just like the aggregation of a banana tree,What has the characteristic of satisfying only when unexaminedArises from causes and performs functions.This is the seeming of ordinary people.841The exact same point is made in The Entrance into the Two Realitiesby AtıŸa, whois usually considered a Consequentialist:The seeming is asserted as twofold:The false one and the correct one.The first is twofold: [appearances of floating] hairs and [double] moonsAs well as the conceptions of inferior philosophical systems.These arising and ceasing phenomena,Only satisfying when they are not examinedAnd being able to perform functions,Are asserted as the correct seeming.842358The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 358"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"In brief, all Centrists agree that the seeming can only refer to mere appearances,as long as these appearances are not questioned. On this basis then, some Cen-trists (such as those just quoted) provide some seeming characteristics of theseunexamined, seeming appearances, while others (such as N›g›rjuna and Can-drakırti) refrain from doing so. Thus, the distinction between Autonomists andConsequentialists by Tsongkhapa and many others that the former analyze andestablish seeming reality conventionally, while the latter do not, does not apply.Neither the issue of no analysis nor the feature of whether seeming characteris-tics of the seeming are provided can serve as hard-and-fast criteria to distinguishAutonomists and Consequentialists. The inherent problem with trying to analyzeand establish conventional seeming reality through reasoning and such is thatthis very process starts to shake the unquestioned ground of what we experienceas seeming reality. In other words, whenever we try to establish the existence ofseeming reality, we are already departing from or destroying it. If the analysis iscarried through to its end, it naturally leads to not finding anything, which is tosay, freedom from reference points. And if not, we get stuck somewhere inbetween mere unquestioned appearances and ultimate reality, thus creating athird “reality.” This is why so many Centrists refrain from analyzing or evenestablishing seeming reality.In the epilogue of his autocommentary onThe Entrance into Centrism, Can-drakırti refers to the mistaken positions of those who say that what the Follow-ers of the Great Exposition or the SÒtra Followers take to be the ultimate isrespectively presented as the seeming by Centrists.843The Eighth Karmapa’s com-mentary identifies those who make such statements as Autonomists.844What thetwo lower schools referred to assert as the ultimate are partless, infinitesimal par-ticles and moments in time. However, the Karmapa says, it is simply impossiblefor Centrists to accept these as seeming reality. If anything, the imputations bythese two schools represent just the false seeming as described by Autonomists.Therefore, not even worldly people assert them as part of their seeming realitythat is the basis for the ordinary transactions of adopting certain things and reject-ing others. Thus, what bigger mistake could Centrists make than accepting suchthings? This consideration likewise negates the two claims that “the Centristswho follow common worldly consensus agree in their presentation of the seem-ing with the Followers of the Great Exposition” and that “there are no Centristsat all who accord in their way of presenting the seeming with the Followers of theGreat Exposition.”As for the Centrists of Yoga Practice, such as ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, the Karmapa says,since they were not around at the time of Candrakırti, he did not directly refutethem. However, one should understand that, implicitly, their presentations ofseeming reality are refuted both through the above consideration and Can-drakırti’s section on negating the “Mere Mentalists.” In this way, when com-The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 359Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 359"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"pared to the Consequentialists, also the system of the Centrists of Yoga Practiceis not the fully perfect system of Centrism. To sum up, in terms of their differ-ent ways of presenting the conventional seeming, one may speak of four kinds ofCentrists: the three who adapt their presentation of the seeming to the threeBuddhist philosophical systems just mentioned845and those who follow com-mon worldly consensus.T The Actual Distinction between Autonomists and ConsequentialistsAfter having refuted the above mistaken opinions, Mikyö Dorje proceeds to pres-ent his own view on the distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists.He states that there is no difference between the explanations of Autonomists andConsequentialists with regard to the expanse of dharmas or profound emptiness(the ultimate object to be observed). They also agree that the operational modeof the wisdom mind (the subject) that realizes this object is the mental peace ofbeing free from all discursiveness. This should be evident from the great numberof quotations from both Autonomist and Consequentialist texts that have beenprovided so far.846Thus, a few verses from Bh›vaviveka’sHeart of Centrismshallsuffice here:No conception, no consciousness,Nothing to be imputed, without example,Without characteristics and without appearance,Without thoughts and without letters—There is no seeing of something to be realizedBy the observing mind. Through this, it is seen.847Autonomists and Consequentialists concur in that the Dharma Body refers to thiswisdom not stirring from the great pacific ocean of the ultimate, nonabidingnirv› ̊a, in which all the ripples of the operational flux of knowable objects anda knower are at rest due to complete freedom from any discursiveness of objectand subject. This is what the disciples call Buddha or the Thus-Gone One, butactually it is completely beyond any object connected to terms or symbols.Since something to be realizedBy cognition about existence or nonexistence has been negated,The nonconceptual insight of the learnedArises in the way of no-arising.848360The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 360"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"It is explained that Buddhahood is not only without conceptions but it evenlacks the discursiveness of any flux of nonconceptual wisdom.Since all aspects of knowable objects are not established,There will not even ariseA mental state that does not conceive anything.Those who know it say that this is unequaled, true reality.Since this is realized, the actual BuddhasAre those who lack any arising of cognition,Because [their minds] became awakened from conceptualityAnd unfolded through nonconceptuality.849Nevertheless, when investigating for true reality by relying on the presentationsof seeming reality with all its vast discursiveness, there are certain differencesbetween Autonomists and Consequentialists as to their ways of conventionallypresenting seeming phenomena. On this conventional level, Autonomists say,“Since all these experiencers perform functions (such as perception) with regardto all these phenomena, they are conventionally established as entities.” In thisway, they exhibit not only the innate kind of reifying clinging to entities but alsothe one through imputation. Still, this is very different from the realists’ under-standing of ultimately real entities that perform ultimately real functions. BothAutonomists and Consequentialists agree that any performing of functions thatoperates through the power of ultimately real entities as well as any valid cogni-tions through which such functioning is established do not exist in any of the tworealities, because ultimately real entities that perform functions do not exist withinthe scope of knowable objects.Still, when Autonomists present seeming reality, they say no more or less thanthat the seeming phenomena that perform functions operating through the powerof illusionlike entities, as well as the illusionlike valid cognitions through whichthese phenomena are established, exist as such illusionlike phenomena. All pre-sentations of any kind of seeming entities are given from the point of view thatthese entities are able to perform functions and bear certain characteristics. Onecan only talk about such entities in relation to certain causes and conditions thatin turn perform functions and bear characteristics only through the power of stillother entities that serve as the factors for presenting the former causes and con-ditions. Thus, as shown by the quotations of various Autonomists in the last sec-tion, they describe three main criteria for seeming entities that represent thecorrect seeming:a) performing a function that corresponds to the way they appearThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 361Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 361"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"b) arising from causes and conditionsc) being satisfying only when not examined850In contrast, the false seeming is something that appears but cannot perform afunction that corresponds to the way that it appears, such as a mirage, a hologram,or the notion of permanent sound.The intention behind this presentation is to eliminate the poison of clingingto inner and outer entities by accepting dependent origination and valid cogni-tion that operate through the power of seeming, illusionlike entities. Because ofsuch descriptions, in India Autonomists were called “the Centrists who establishillusion through reasoning.”However, even if it were just on the seeming level that such illusionlike phe-nomena were to operate through the power of seeming entities and were estab-lished through valid cognition, they would have to exist as such entities in anundeceiving way. If they really and undeceivingly existed as such entities, allseeming, conditioned phenomena would not be delusive. Therefore, it is inter-nally inconsistent to accept phenomena that operate through the power of illu-sionlike entities as being established through valid cognition, because if an illusoryhorse were established through valid cognition that operated through the powerof entities, this illusory horse would not be an illusion but a horse that was anautonomous entity. Hence, when adhering by means of valid cognition to thepoint that all phenomena are real merely in the manner of illusions, it is obviousthat this involves a slight remainder of apprehending discursive characteristics. AsAŸvagho ̋a’s Stages of Meditation on the Ultimate Mind of Enlightenmentsays:Thus, [illusory appearances] satisfy when unexamined.Through examining mere illusions, one is deceived.The mind is an expression of illusion,And enlightenment is like an illusion too.Hence, once verbal expression has been relinquished,It is free from discursiveness, not seen by MañjuŸrı.Illusory [phenomena] are not mere illusions:If they were, they would not be established as such [phenomena].If they were established, it would followThat [such] illusory phenomena are [taught] in the scriptural systems of others too.Therefore, the illusory nature [of phenomena],Just like an illusion, is inexpressible as being “this.”and362The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 362"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"Through specifications such as emptiness,Limitless examples such as being illusionlike,And the methodical approaches of various vehicles,The nonabiding middle is illustrated.Despite being illustrated, it cannot be illustrated.There is nothing to be removed from it.Even emptiness is empty of being empty.In this, there are neither Buddhas nor sentient beings.851Candrahari’s Jewel Garlandagrees:If illusionlike phenomenal existenceAnd illusory wisdom BuddhasWere illusions that are established through reasoning,It would follow that they are not illusory but true.If you say, “The unchanging is established as illusion,”What is established through reasoning becomes untrue.852One may wonder here, “Would it then not be the case that actual, true real-ity is not realized by relying on the dharma system of the Autonomists?” This isnot the case. Although they do not entirely fulfill the intention of the Buddha andN›g›rjuna, they eventually do realize the actuality of emptiness (as what is to beproven) with regard to all subjects in question by way of reasons such as the free-dom from unity and multiplicity. Thus, the difference between Autonomists andConsequentialists lies in the assertion as to whether such means of proof are orare not established as mere conventionalities. However, in the Autonomist sys-tem too, the mental states that adhere to probandum and means of proof beingconventionally established are later naturally put to an end through the force ofextensively and thoroughly becoming familiar with the Centrist view.In brief, the essential difference between Autonomists and Consequentialistsis as follows. In terms of a Consequentialist system of their own, there is no pres-entation of anything to be proven or any means of proof. Nevertheless, they pro-nounce negation and proof in accordance with the world for the sake ofeliminating the imputations of others. In the Autonomists’ own system, in termsof ultimate reality, there is also nothing to be proved nor any means of proof.However, in terms of seeming reality, through the justified presentations of whatis to be proved and the means of proof as the technique to investigate for true real-ity, Autonomists pronounce particular negations and proofs that eliminate theimputations of others.The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 363Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 363"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"When Consequentialists engage in negation and proof, from the perspectiveof their opponents and as mere pronouncements that follow the commonconsensus of others, as they see fit, they may formulate consequences that eitherimpel or do not impel an autonomous reasoning,853probative arguments withregard to the meanings of such consequences, or inferential statements by prov-ing each of the three modes individually. At times, they also state positions andthen prove the modes of these. However, by doing so, they do not becomeAutonomists, since they do not accept any of these utterances as real or estab-lished through valid cognition on any level of reality. Nevertheless—or rather,precisely because of this—it is completely fine for them to formulate any state-ment whatsoever that serves the purpose of dispersing the wrong ideas of others.From the Consequentialists’ own perspective, all negations and proofs are asfleeting as a mirage dissolving in space. In verbally pronouncing such negationsand proofs, they just follow others’ wishes to dispel their own misconceptions.Unlike iron hooks used to direct elephants, such negations and proofs are notmeans to lead others somewhere against their wishes.In this context, the claim “All that Consequentialists do is to draw absurd con-sequences from the position of others” overlooks the fact that, when explainingN›g›rjuna’s Fundamental Versesin his Lucid Words, even a Consequentialist likeCandrakırti several times formulates the classical Indian five-membered proba-tive argument (containing a position, a reason, an example, an application, anda conclusion)854as it is used by non-Buddhist logicians as well as Autonomists likeBh›vaviveka. Candrakırti also provides an explanation of Buddhap›lita’s conse-quences with regard to the Enumerators’ claim of things arising from themselvesin affirmative terms:We do not see any purpose for something that exists to arise again, andwe also see that it would do so endlessly. You [Enumerators] neitherassert that something arisen arises again nor assert that it does so end-lessly. Therefore, your argument lacks justification, and you contradictwhat you yourselves accept.855Needless to say, when Candrakırti employs such formulations, he always doesso without any underlying ontological or real epistemological foundation. Ingeneral, all Consequentialist pronouncements in debate are exclusively made forthe purpose of invalidating the mistaken ideas of others about true reality. Toachieve this purpose, Consequentialists sometimes just employ absurd conse-quences and at other times describe things the way things are. The Consequen-tialists’ approach of not claiming anything themselves and merely invalidating thepositions of others is not a case of mere caviling or sophistry, since their inten-tion is very different. As for people who have wrong ideas about true reality and364The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 364"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"consequently suffer, their minds are stuck in holding on to their own positionsand reference points. It is from their perspective and for their benefit that alltheir positions are eliminated through justified reasonings that they themselvesacknowledge. In this way, Consequentialist reasoning helps them to come to apoint where they can give up all reference points and directly realize true realityon their own.Moreover, Consequentialists are not the only ones who make statements thatsome of their presentations are expedient and just made from the perspective ofothers, while they themselves do not assert such. Dharmakırti has repeatedlyemployed the same approach. For example, his Commentary on Valid Cognitionsays:This meaning of a term and a common locus,Although they do not exist,Are expressed according to common consensus.In entities, they do not exist.The presentations of properties and what bears these properties,Of what is different and what is not different, however they are,[Are given] without examining actual true reality,Just as they are common worldly consensus.It is on this basis aloneThat all proofs and what is to be proven are presented.For the sake of introducing [others] to ultimate reality, They were made by the learned.856The same applies to ⁄›ntarak ̋ita and KamalaŸıla, who many times explicitly saythat certain reasonings they employ (which have all the formal elements of anautonomous inference) are only given by way of provisionally applying certainsubjects, predicates, and reasons in such inferences, without any of these repre-senting their own position. Such reasonings are employed on various levels ofwhat McClintock calls “sliding scales of analysis.” She presents a very clear exam-ple from ⁄›ntarak ̋ita’s Synopsis of True Realityand its commentary byKamalaŸıla857for this approach, which is the argument that “infinitesimal parti-cles are not beyond the sense faculties, that is, they are perceptible, because theyare the objects of the sense faculties.” Here, KamalaŸıla explicitly states that he and⁄›ntarak ̋ita do not accept either the subject (infinitesimal particles) or the pred-icate (being perceptible) or the reason (being objects of the sense faculties), noteven conventionally at respectively higher levels of their analysis.858Some people might wonder here, “If Consequentialists give extensive presen-The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 365Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 365"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"tations of the seeming while seeming phenomena are not established throughseeming valid cognition even on this seeming level, does this not mean that seem-ing karmic causes and results, bondage and liberation, and so on never existed onthe seeming level?” The answer is no, because Consequentialists pronounce thesethings according to the presentations of the seeming from the perspective of noanalysis as these were provided by the genuine beings who strive for higher realms,liberation, and Buddhahood. It might be said that without karmic causes andresults of the seeming level being established, no presentations of such seemingkarmic causes and results are appropriate. However, there is no contradiction inthis because, from the perspective of mental mistakenness, there indubitablyappear many conventions for various approaches of doing certain things in cer-tain ways and not in others, and these are undeceivingly experienced and com-mon consensus in the world, although none of them is really established. AsBuddhap›lita comments:It is because of worldly conventions that [N›g›rjuna says]:Everything is true or untrue,Both true and untrue . . .859Consider two children who read a comic book. One of them might say, “Theguy with the long snout and hanging ears is Donald Duck, and the fellow withthe yellow beak and white feathers is Goofy.” The other may reply, “No, you arewrong. The one with the long snout and hanging ears is Goofy, and the other oneis Donald Duck.” To settle their dispute, they might ask their elder sister to tellthem who is right and who is wrong. Knowing very well that both Goofy andDonald Duck do not exist and are just pictures in a comic book, she still answersin accordance with the common conventions of the world of comic books. There-fore, on this level, she cannot be accused of telling lies. Likewise, although theBuddha directly saw that the nature of all phenomena is emptiness, by consid-ering worldly conventions, he declared some things to be true and others to beuntrue:Whatever is asserted as existent in the world, that I assert as existenttoo. Whatever is asserted as nonexistent in the world, that I assert asnonexistent too.The First Sangye Nyenba Rinpoche says:Although there is no establishment of seeming karmic causes andresults through seeming valid cognition even on the seeming level, it366The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 366"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"is fine to present their existence as conventions in dependence on theperspective of the consciousnesses of those for whom they appear as ifthey existed as such causes and results. However, through just such adegree of imputed existence, seeming karmic causes and results do notqualify as something that actually exists on either level of the two real-ities. For, if they did, the discursive extreme of existence would not bea discursive extreme.860Then, the Eighth Karmapa presents his own understanding of how the splitbetween Autonomists and Consequentialists originated. Based on N›g›rjuna’srefutation of things arising from themselves, Bh›vaviveka disagreed with Bud-dhap›lita as to whether, on the seeming level, there is a need to establish for boththe proponent and the opponent a seeming subject of debate through seemingvalid cognition. In his defense of Buddhap›lita, Candrakırti explained that whenCentrists debate with realists, not only is there no need for a common subject ofdebate that is established for both through valid cognition, but such a commonbasis for negation and proof is by definition impossible to establish for both Cen-trists and realists. Centrists, through valid cognition acknowledged by others,negate that there is any reality in a given phenomenon, whereas realists, throughautonomous valid cognition, cling to this phenomenon as being real and try toaffirm it.So, if the very nature of any basis for negation and proof, such as a subject inquestion, is negated, how then can a subject of debate be presented? Obviously,it cannot be anything on the seeming level that either falsely appears (such as amirage) or is falsely imputed (such as a real self). Rather, what is taken as such asubject in question are the mere appearances, such as a sprout, that appear dueto fundamental ignorance and are accepted by the world as ultimate reality. ForCentrists, these do not exist as actual knowable objects on any level of the tworealities, but they generally describe them as “the correct seeming.” This is thesubject in question that appears from the cognitive perspective of the natural,unquestioning mental states experienced by everybody from shepherds to learnedscholars. In this way, such a subject of debate is adapted to the perceptions andthe thinking that are acknowledged by other debaters. Centrists only adopt suchappearances as the subject in question for the sake of negating any status of real-ity that is mistakenly ascribed to it by other people. For Centrists, there is noother subject in question that would be established through seeming valid cog-nition as a part of their own system. Hence, no such thing can be taken by themas a proper subject of negation and proof in debate. Since the same goes for thepredicate and the reason, none of the three modes of a correct reason can beestablished through their own system either. Consequently, there is nothing tobe proven in any way through any kind of valid cognition of their own system.The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 367Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 367"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"In this way, any charges of incurring the flaw of the subject of debate being notestablished861are rendered pointless as well.Of course, this does not mean that Centrists are not able to refute wrong ideasabout really existing phenomena and real causality. Their approach here can becompared to the one of Buddhist realists. In their own systems, Buddhist realistsdo not assert that imputations such as the Enumerators’ primal substance areknowable objects. Nevertheless, they take these mere imputations that are justacknowledged by others as the subject in question and then employ probativearguments for the sake of refuting the wrong ideas of others that such imputa-tions exist as actual knowable objects.The Eighth Karmapa quotes from ⁄›ntarak ̋ita’s autocommentary onTheOrnament of Centrism:If one accepts that all phenomena are without nature, the subject prop-erty and so on are not established for oneself. Is it not therefore the casethat the conventions of inference and something to be inferred are notestablished? So how does the one who makes the inference ascertainsomething? If no reason that proves that “all phenomena are withoutnature” is pronounced, this [statement] is not established, since thereis no reason [for it]. Therefore, the desired purpose [of showing thatall phenomena are empty] is not accomplished. However, if [a reasonthat actually proves this] is pronounced, this reason exists. In that case,again, it is not established that all phenomena are without nature.862Therefore, the desired purpose is not accomplished either. So, thingslook pretty bad here.

Thisapproach is only to express the flaws in the theses of others withoutconsidering any thesis of one’s own. I too definitely do not eliminate theordinary entities that appear for the eye consciousness and so on. How-ever, if analyzed through knowledge and wisdom, just as in the trunkof a banana tree, not even a tiny core appears [in such entities]. Hence,I do not assert them ultimately. In this way, through not negating whatappears, I engage without clinging in the conventions of proof and whatis to be proven. For this reason, there is no invalidation whatsoever ofthe statement that all phenomena are without nature. As it is said:By not depending on ill clinging,Conventions are nicely established.By being learned in conventions,One is not ignorant about the meaning of the treatises.864Jñ›nagarbha’s Distinction between the Two Realitiesand his autocommentaryalso agree with this. He says that, apart from the aspect of simple, immediateappearances in the minds of both debaters, there is nothing on whose status theproponents of different traditions agree. Thus, those who take these plain appear-ances as the subject have to accept that it is only through employing reasons andsuch of this very same level of mere appearance that they can reflect on whetherthis very subject actually exists or not.865In brief, the later Autonomist masters say that there are no theses or theirproperties and so on that are commonly established for both debaters. Therefore,within the context of debate, they take things such as apples and books thatThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 369Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 369"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"appear for the unquestioning consciousnesses of both debaters. The Conse-quentialists say that any autonomously established thesis or its properties and soon that are commonly established for both debaters are impossible. Therefore,within the perspective of debate, Centrist debaters adapt to their opponents byjust verbally following the pronouncements of those theses and their propertiesthat are voiced by these opponents. Except for Autonomists and Consequential-ists using slightly different words here, the Karmapa says, the meaning of theirstatements is the same.This means that, having made it sufficiently clear that mere appearances haveno reality, Centrists can still go on to discuss these appearances, in the same wayin which non-Centrists can talk about all the aspects of what appears for them.In this way, believe it or not, the Centrist approach is in fact very much down toearth, for how could we ever pretend to meaningfully discuss all kinds of meta-physical speculations if we have not even properly analyzed the status of what isright before our eyes? Thus, any philosophical analysis must start with whatdirectly appears to us and then enter the reasoning process from there.Is there any way to say then that these appearances are similar for Centrists andtheir opponents? Take an adult and a small child who watch the same movie onTV and then discuss what they see, the former being fully aware that nothing thatappears in the movie is real and the latter lacking such awareness. (Of course, wemay have experienced that it is sometimes exactly the other way around . . .) Still,if the adult wishes to explain to the child that none of what appears on the screenis real, there is no way to do so except by referring to these very appearances.Other than for Buddhas or bodhisattvas in the meditative equipoise of directlyrealizing emptiness, dualistic appearances arise for all beings, whether they areCentrists or not. When not resting in such meditative equipoise, even bod-hisattvas on the ten grounds have remainders of such appearances, although theyimmediately recognize them as the illusions that they are. The difference lies inthe degree of their habitual tendencies to reify (or their complete lack of such ten-dencies). All ordinary beings are subject to the same type of fundamental igno-rance about the nature of phenomena and thus experience illusory appearances.Thus, a mere intellectual ascertainment of all these appearances being empty isa necessary step but in itself is not a sufficient antidote to fully eradicate thedeeply rooted ignorance that causes dualistic appearances to arise. In brief, dual-istic appearances do not simply cease when emptiness is conceptually understoodthrough reasoning.When Centrists engage in debate with others, depending on the opponent,they may choose to talk on a lower level of analysis by seemingly assuming somegrosser type of reality, be it external material objects or the level of mere mentalexperience. They may do so in order to eliminate an opponent’s wrong views bystarting with the most coarse notions, such as permanence, and then showing that370The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 370"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"all things are momentary and impermanent. Obviously, there are not too manypeople in the world with whom one can successfully talk right away about all phe-nomena in heaven and on earth being empty of any reality whatsoever. However,during the whole process of employing such provisional levels of analysis that mayinclude what looks like autonomous reasoning to others, for Centrists it is nevera question that all of these are merely skillful, expedient means to address peopleindividually on the levels of understanding that they can manage, but these meansare applied without ever reifying the techniques or the resultant understanding.After all, exactly what appears to different people, in what way, and whetherwe see the same or not is not the point. Obviously, when the child in front of theTV analyzes and realizes the unreality of what appears on the screen, she does sosolely on the basis of what appears to her own mind. Likewise, in Centrist analy-sis, the point is not to scrutinize the appearances of others but to focus on whatappears for oneself and then analyze it as to its reality. What is to be tackledthrough this analytical process is solely one’s own ignorance and delusion, whichproduces one’s own experiences and the ensuing mental afflictions. What makesus suffer is our own reifying experience of our own appearances due to our ownignorance, not others’ experience of what appears to them due to their ignorance.Consequently, if we wish to stop being ignorant, we must go through our ownanalysis based on our own appearances. All that others can do is to assist us in thisjob by providing the analytic tools (Centrists are happy to do so), but the actualunderstanding can only come about in our own minds through our efforts inapplying these tools.In brief, the Karmapa says, with regard to the manner of what is to be provenand the means of proof in terms of emptiness, the intentions of Autonomist andConsequentialist masters are not different, as they are all great bodhisattvas whohave directly seen the actual nature of phenomena and wish to introduce all sen-tient beings to nothing but this nature. The only distinction lies in their slightlydiffering approaches as to how the correct view of the ultimate is generated in themind stream and accordingly communicated to others. Just as skilled physicianseliminate various diseases by prescribing different sweet and sour medicines, allCentrists eradicate various kinds of reification through different ways of teach-ing the dharma to those who entertain specific reifications. Therefore, who couldbe concerned about these masters having discordant intentions just because oftheir limitless, specific ways of teaching the dharma? As Jigden Sumgön says:All assemblies of noble ones—the Buddhas, bodhisattvas, vıras, ̃›ki ̊ıs, dharma protectors, and guardians in the ten directions andthree times—are of one mind with regard to the profound expanse ofdharmas free from discursiveness. Also, all the teachings that teach thisand express the inexpressible are of one melody and one voice.The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 371Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 371"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"Finally, the Karmapa emphasizes that the Autonomist and Consequentialistapproaches are both soteriologically efficient; that is, they are suitable foundationsfor attaining liberation from cyclic existence and a Buddha’s omniscience.Autonomists say that if phenomena are analyzed through reasoning that ana-lyzes for the ultimate, there is nothing to be found at all, be it a basis for empti-ness or any properties of which this basis is empty, the fact of being empty or notbeing empty, the nature of phenomena, or the bearers of this nature. Hence, allphenomena are the utterly peaceful absence of all discursiveness and characteris-tics. However, these appearances of mind and objects in their illusionlike naturecannot be negated through reasoning that analyzes conventions. Thus, by con-ventionally taking these appearances as the bases of emptiness, Autonomists assertthat ultimately they are empty of all properties that may be imputed by Buddhistand non-Buddhist realists. They assert that all phenomena are empty of a natureof their own and that, from the perspective of perfect study, reflection, and med-itation, or from the perspective of the meditative equipoise of the noble ones ofthe great vehicle, all discursiveness and characteristics are at utter peace. There-fore, this is greatly superior to any kind of emptiness asserted by realists and is def-initely suitable to serve as the foundation for the path to liberation and as theremedy for the two obscurations.However, if the Autonomist position is taken to mean that, conventionally, theappearances of mind and objects appear for the meditative equipoise of the nobleones of the great vehicle, then either these appearances would become the ulti-mate and something that withstands analysis or this meditative equipoise wouldbe mistaken. On the other hand, if it were said that these appearances do notappear in this way, there would be the flaw of this meditative equipoise denyingphenomena on the conventional level, since phenomena that conventionally arenot empty are made into emptiness. In this case, the teachings on the definitivemeaning (emptiness), the supreme knowledge of perfect study, reflection, andmeditation, as well as the wisdom of a Buddha would all become causes thatdestroy entities on the conventional level. To think like this is thus not suitableand also contradicts what is accepted by Autonomists.As was said earlier, according to Consequentialists, emptiness does not meanthat phenomena are really existent before being analyzed and then are madeempty through reasoned analysis, just as a vase being smashed with a hammer.In the same way, phenomena are not non-empty as long as the wisdom of nobleones has not dawned and then become empty once it has. Emptiness does alsonot signify that something first exists and subsequently becomes non-existent(such as a flame having died down), nor is emptiness total non-existence (like aflower in the sky). Consequentialists do not just contrive some conceptual empti-ness, such as pretending phenomena to be empty when in fact they are not. Also,emptiness does not mean that phenomena are empty of an object of negation that372The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 372"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"is something other than these very phenomena, such as a vase being empty ofwater. All of these notions are not the actual emptiness as understood in Cen-trism, since they do not mean being empty of an intrinsic nature and thus are justvarious kinds of mentally contrived emptiness, emptiness in the sense of extinc-tion, or limited emptiness. Therefore, none of these mistaken notions of empti-ness is suitable to serve as the proper basis for the path to liberation or as theremedy for the two obscurations.What then is suitable? All phenomena are primordially not established as anyreference point for discursiveness, be it the four extremes of existence, nonexis-tence, and so on; the eight extremes of arising, ceasing, and so on; or the four-teen extremes of permanence and impermanence,866being empty or not empty,or real or delusive. Just this is conventionally labeled as “emptiness,” “true real-ity,” “suchness,” and so on. It is suitable to serve as the foundation for the pathto liberation and as the remedy for the two obscurations, since afflictive and cog-nitive obscurations originate from the reifying clinging to real entities. Onceyogic practitioners realize that all phenomena are primordially free from all dis-cursiveness, the entirety of reifying clinging to real entities is put to an end.Therefore, conventionally, the remedy for all obscurations is to rest in medi-tative equipoise within this emptiness of all phenomena being empty of a natureof their own, which is the natural, true way of being of all knowable objects.This is the sun that outshines the darkness of mistaken views and the cure thateliminates the poison of reification. It is the quintessence of the Buddha’s teach-ing and the supreme cause for gaining mastery over the five inexhaustible spheresof adornment of all Blissfully Gone Ones (enlightened body, speech, mind, qual-ities, and activity). Therefore, the Karmapa says, those who wish for liberationand omniscience from the depths of their hearts should engage in it throughstudy, reflection, and meditation.THow the Distinction between Autonomists andConsequentialists by Later Tibetans Is a NoveltyAfter his own description of the distinction between Autonomists and Conse-quentialists, the Eighth Karmapa presents the novel position of Tsongkhapa onthis distinction by reporting the gist of what the foremost representatives ofTsongkhapa’s system say. The statements of his two main students, Kedrub GelegBalsang (1385–1438) and Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen867(1364–1432), are in accordwith Tsongkhapa’s own explanations in both hisGreat Stages of the Pathand hisEssence of Good Explanations on the Expedient and the Definitive Meaning.Kedrub Je explains that for Consequentialists, even conventionally, there isno valid cognition that evaluates a subject to be evaluated as established throughThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 373Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 373"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"its own specific characteristics. From this perspective, a subject that is establishedthrough valid cognition as common to proponent and opponent is impossible.Nevertheless, they generate in others the realization of the lack of reality merelythrough inferences acknowledged by others and consequences. These are argu-ments that are formulated on the basis of two factors. First, in general, a subjectis established through valid cognition for both proponent and opponent. Second,the establishment of subject, subject property, and so on through valid cognitionis accepted in the system of the opponent. Autonomists identify what is unmis-takenly found about something to be evaluated that is established through itsown specific characteristics from the perspective of the object’s own way ofbeing.868It is in this sense that, based on a subject of debate that is established asappearing in common for the systems of both the proponent (the Autonomist)and the opponent, they formulate reasons to prove the predicate of the proban-dum about which the proponent wishes to make an inference. This is the mean-ing of an autonomous reason.869On what is ascribed here to the Autonomists,McClintock comments:This stipulation recalls the general principle of Indian Buddhist debatelogic that the three characteristics of the evidence (trirÒpahetu) in aninference-for-others (par›rth›num›na) must be acknowledged by bothparties to the debate. But on mKhas grub’s reading, there is also theaddedrequirement that the subject and other elements in the inferencemust be “established as appearing similarly.” What is noteworthy is theinsistence that even the means(i.e., the tshad ma) by which the ele-ments of the inference come to be established for the parties in thedebate must be established as appearing similarly. In other words, formKhas grub it is central to the definition of an autonomous inferencethat the two parties understand exactly the same thing in exactly the samewaywhen they assert that the subject and the evidence and so on areestablished by a tshad ma.870Gyaltsab Je says that the system of the Autonomists is to engage in negationand proof based on what is established as appearing in common for both propo-nent and opponent by investigating the meaning of what is conventionally labeledas subject, predicate, and reason. The system of the Consequentialists is to engagein negation and proof based on subject, predicate, and reason being establishedthrough conventional valid cognition as appearing in common for both propo-nent and opponent, although there is nothing that is established through validcognition when investigating for the meaning of what is labeled as subject, pred-icate, and reason.871The Karmapa refutes these claims by initially entering into the style of formal374The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 374"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"debate. He says that, on both levels of reality, the great Consequentialist mastersnever asserted that subject, reason, and predicate are established through anykind of valid cognition for two reasons: First, they are neither established throughthe valid cognition of the reasoning consciousness that evaluates the ultimate northrough the valid cognition of the wisdom in the meditative equipoise of nobleones. Second, Consequentialists say that a valid cognition that evaluates con-ventions is not established as valid cognition on both levels of reality. The firstreason applies because if what Kedrub Je and Gyaltsab Je say is established wereestablished through such a reasoning consciousness or the wisdom in the medi-tative equipoise of noble ones, then subject, reason, and predicate would be ulti-mate reality. This latter reason entails the predicate, since this is what Kedrub andGyaltsab themselves accept.872There is also no way for them to just accept thisconsequence.The second reason also applies, because Consequentialists declare that theydo not assert other-dependent, worldly, seeming phenomenal entities, such assubject, predicate, and reason, but speak of them from the perspective of theworld. However, not only ultimately but even on the seeming level, they do notaccept any claim that these seeming entities are established through conventionalvalid cognition as something that performs a function. As Candrakırti’s Entranceinto Centrismsays:It is not in the way of you asserting other-dependent entitiesThat I accept the seeming.For the sake of the result, despite their nonexistence,By referring to the perspective of the world, I say, “They exist.”[The seeming] does not exist for arhatsWho have entered peace by relinquishing the aggregates.If it did not exist for the world in just the same way,I would not say, “It exists” in dependence on the world.If you are not invalidated by the world,Just keep negating this [seeming reality] that depends on the world.You should debate with the world about this,And later I will rely upon the one who prevails.873Furthermore, Consequentialists do not say that there is a valid cognition thatestablishes subject, predicate, and reason as something that appears in commonfor Centrists and realists. Quite to the contrary, Candrakırti’s autocommentaryon The Entrance into Centrism states:The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 375Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 375"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"All these entities that are like reflections have neither any specific char-acteristics nor any general characteristics. So what perceptual or infer-ential cognition would there be [for them]? There is only oneimmediate perception, which is omniscient wisdom.874His Lucid Wordsagrees:If there were any so-called certainty for us, it would have to arise fromeither valid cognition or from something that is not valid cognition.However, [such certainty] does not exist. How is that? If there were any[real] uncertainty, there would also be some certainty that depends onand serves as the remedy for this [uncertainty]. However, when uncer-tainty does not exist for us, how could there be any certainty as itsopposite, since it does not depend on any other counterpart? This isjust like [discussing] the short and the long horn of a donkey. Oncethere is no certainty in this way, for the sake of proving what shouldwe come up with any valid cognitions? What would be their number,their characteristics, and their objects? Would they arise from them-selves, from others, from both, or without a cause? We do not lose aword on all of this.875In particular, on either level of the two realities, this master nowhere assertsthat the entities of subject, predicate, and reason (that are established through areasoning consciousness or some conventional valid cognition in dependence onthe two realities) exist as being established in common with the world. Rather,he says:Nowhere did the Buddhas teach that “entities exist.”876It may be objected, “The Consequentialists’ investigation for true reality meansto eliminate the wrong ideas of the world based on pronouncements that areacknowledged by others in the world. Therefore, in just the way that subject,predicate, and reason (which are established through worldly conventional validcognition) are established by the world, Consequentialists also must accept theseas being established as something that appears in common to both parties.” Antic-ipating such wrong objections, Candrakırti already gave an answer in the sensethat such a necessity to accept worldly valid cognition does not follow. In the con-text of investigating for true reality, all negations and proofs to ascertain truereality are not established through any autonomous or independent valid cogni-tion, be it worldly or supramundane. At the same time, through the mere depend-ent origination of reasonable and unreasonable thoughts of the two debaters, the376The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 376"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"correct meaning is made clear through the elimination of conceptions that do notaccord with the dharma. As The Entrance into Centrismsays:If worldly [seeing] represented valid cognition,The world itself would see true reality,So what need is there for other noble ones, and what is the point of thepath of the noble ones?It is not suitable for [the minds of] fools to be valid cognition.Since worldly [seeing] in no way is valid cognition,In the context of [analyzing] true reality, there is no invalidation throughthe world.877What is seen by a mistaken consciousness cannot invalidate what is seen by anunmistaken consciousness, just as someone with no knowledge about jewelrycannot invalidate the knowledge of an experienced jeweler.In particular, the same people claim, “When investigating for suchness freefrom discursiveness, one must definitely identify a subject, a predicate, and a rea-son on the worldly seeming level that serve as the basis for this investigation andare established through conventional valid cognition.” Such is just a claim thatdoes not consider the meaning of Candrakırti’s statement that all entities are notestablished through their nature. Moreover, it simply ignores Candrakırti’sexplicit proclamation that, in the context of investigating for true reality, thebases for this investigation (subjects, predicates, and reasons) on the worldly seem-ing level are not to be analyzed as to whether they are established through con-ventional valid cognition. Rather, the valid cognition of a reasoning consciousnessthat investigates for true reality does not find that subject, predicate, and reasonon the worldly seeming level are established through conventional valid cognitionas anything other than true reality itself. It is precisely this fact of notfindingsomething established through conventional valid cognition that invalidates theclaim that such could be found. As The Entrance into Centrismstates:If these [worldly] entities are analyzed,Apart from just being what bears the nature of true reality,They are not found to abide on the hither side.Therefore, worldly conventional reality should not be analyzed.878His Lucid Wordsmakes the same point:Hence, it is in this way that the understanding of things in the worldis presented through the four [kinds of] valid cognition. These areThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 377Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 377"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"established in mutual dependence: When there are valid cognitions,there are referents to be evaluated, and when there are referents to beevaluated, there are valid cognitions. However, neither valid cogni-tions nor what is to be evaluated are established through their natures.Hence, let there be only the worldly just as it is seen.879Actually, in the context of investigating for true reality, let alone establishinganything through conventional valid cognition, even when one engages in con-ventional negations in dependence on certain opponents through reasonings thatanalyze for true reality, there is an essential practical point. While investigating fortrue reality, it is crucial not to mentally engage in any negations and proofs withregard to the ultimate, and thus rest the mind free from all discursiveness of nega-tion and proof. As The Entrance into the Supreme Knowledge of Centrismdeclares:Both negation and proof are simply to be stopped.Actually, there is no negation and proof at all.When one has made oneself familiar with this mode,True excellence will be attained.880It is only from the perspective of worldly people who speak about perceptualand inferential valid cognition as it is acknowledged by these people themselvesthat Candrakırti pronounces such valid cognitions. He just follows what thesepeople say without examining it and then employs it as a basis for negation andproof in the investigation for true reality. However, even if worldly seeming sub-jects, predicates, and reasons were established through conventional valid cogni-tion as things that appear in common to both proponent and opponent, his sametext states that he would never use any such subjects, predicates, and reasons thatare established in this way:You might say, “This contradicts perception and such.”It does not: I do not negate[Appearances] that [only] satisfy when unexamined.Since they are just established as mere conventions,They are not a position or a reason.881One may want to ask Candrakırti, “If no valid cognition to establish certaintyis presented in your own system, how do you ascertain that all things are with-out arising from themselves and so on?” He answers in The Lucid Words:Such pronouncements of certainty exist [only] for worldly people byway of justifications that are established for themselves, but not for378The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:36 AM Page 378"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"the noble ones. “So do the noble ones not have any justifications?”Who can say whether they have or not? The ultimate of the noble onesis a matter of utter silence. Therefore, how should there be any dis-cursiveness where there is neither justification nor nonjustification?882A further question might then be, “However, if the noble ones, in this contextof investigating for true reality, do not establish this profound reality through rea-sonings that are established through conventional valid cognition, by what meansdo they make others realize it?”The noble ones do not pronounce justifications through worldly con-ventions. However, they [provisionally] accept the justifications thatare common consensus for the world alone only in order to inducerealization in others. It is precisely through this that they make worldlypeople realize [true reality].883The Karmapa concludes his argument by saying that Tsongkhapa and his fol-lowers either did not gain certainty about all these extensive explanations by Can-drakırti or they even went so far as to claim that these are not Candrakırti’s words.In this vein, Tillemans’s judgment on Tsongkhapa’s own position on these issuescan only be repeated:It does seem that there is an overly baroque transformation ofPr›saºgika thought largely due to the extreme reluctance on Tsongkha pa’s part to take some of Candrakırti’s claims at their radical facevalue, and especially due to his own attempt to harmonize Pr›saºgikaphilosophy with that of the logicians. In particular, in makingPr›saºgikas adopt a logician’spositions on things being established bypram› ̊as, Tsong kha pa introduces into Candrakırti’s philosophy akind of lingering deference to objective facts which I think a simplerand more literal reading of Candrakırti just does not bear out. It isironic that Tsong kha pa, who more than anyone brought out differencesbetween Sv›tantrika and Pr›saºgika, read Candrakırti as being de factoan adherent of Buddhist logic.884In line with the Karmapa, Huntington sees Candrakırti being misrepresented inan even more general sense:And so—in what amounts to a deeply ironic twist of fate—Candrakırtiwas posthumously awarded highest honors from an orthodox scholarlytradition that could sustain its authority only by refusing to take seri-The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 379Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 379"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"ously what he had himself insisted upon: N›g›rjuna is not in the busi-ness of providing rational arguments designed to substantiate, prove,establish, or make certain anything.885As for the Autonomists, Tsongkhapa and his followers claim, “Autonomistsconventionally accept that phenomena such as subject, predicate, and reason areestablished through their own specific characteristics from the perspective of theobject’s own way of being. They also accept that their being established in this wayis what is found through unmistaken valid cognition.” In his Essence of Good Expla-nations, Tsongkhapa specifies what he sees as the main support for his claim ofAutonomists conventionally accepting that entities are established through theirown specific characteristics (which is taken over by his followers). There, he quotesthe following very problematic passage from Bh›vaviveka’s Lamp of Knowledge:If you say here that “the imaginary nature, which is mental and verbalspeech about what is called form, does not exist,” this is a denial of[certain] entities, because it denies mental and verbal speech.886At the same time, Tsongkhapa says:With regard to conventional existents, terms such as their “nature”and their “specific characteristics” are often also employed in Conse-quentialist texts, while terms such as “not being established through anature of their own,” “not arisen by nature,” and “not being substan-tially established” abound in Bh›vaviveka’s scriptures too. Therefore,they seem difficult to distinguish. Nevertheless, this [above] explana-tion [by Bh›vaviveka] on the meaning of the existence or the lack of anature in terms of characteristics that is taught in [The SÒtra] ThatUnravels the Intentionis the clearest source for [the fact] that this mas-ter conventionally asserts that entities are established through theirown specific characteristics.887To be sure, the above passage in The Lamp of Knowledgeis found in the overallcontext of explainingFundamental VersesXXV.24:Peace is the utter peace of all observed objectsAnd the utter peace of discursiveness.At no time did the Buddha teachAny dharma to anybody.What Tsongkhapa quotes is just a consequence drawn by Bh›vaviveka from380The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 380"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"what he reports as the position of a hypothetical Yog›c›ra opponent in terms ofthe three natures. This opponent says that it is due to the imaginary nature’s lackof nature in terms of specific characteristics that one speaks about its nonexistencein the sense of lacking a nature. Bh›vaviveka’s consequence in this quote thenidentifies the imaginary nature with verbal and mental speech, that is, thoughts.This in itself is already questionable, since the usual Yog›c›ra description of theimaginary nature does not refer to thought and speech themselves (which wouldbelong to the other-dependent nature) but to the imaginary objectsof thoughtsand speech. But leaving that aside, Tsongkhapa claims that Bh›vaviveka’s asser-tion of entities being established through their own specific characteristics is dueto his rejection of the Yog›c›ra claim of the nonexistence of the imaginary naturein this consequence. By this, Tsongkhapa in effect says that Bh›vaviveka hascommitted himself to the opposite of what he rejects here, that is, to the imagi-nary nature existing withits own specific characteristics. However, Bh›vaviveka’srejection in itself does not imply anything about his own position, let alone theparticular position that entities are conventionally established through their spe-cific characteristics. In fact, he presents it as one of his main principles that noneof his denials of the positions of opponents imply that he has to assert the oppo-site (or anything else). For, in both hisLamp of Knowledgeand The Blaze of Rea-soning, he repeatedly insists that his negations are nonimplicative negations.888Moreover, just a little bit further down from the passage in Bh›vaviveka’sLamp of Knowledgethat Tsongkhapa quotes, this very text explicitly says:Those who wish to demonstrate that imaginary referents (don) do notexist should assert the justified Centrist way stated by master[N›g›rjuna].889Considering these points and Tsongkhapa’s own admission that Consequential-ist and Autonomist texts are difficult to distinguish, while he nevertheless is notshy in providing such an out-of-context quote as the clearest evidence for hisown claim that Autonomists assert entities as being established through theirown specific characteristics, one cannot escape the conclusion that there is sim-ply no evidence for this claim at all.890This is not just a minor or isolated point, but the crucial stepping-stone forTsongkhapa’s whole reinterpretation of Centrism and the Autonomist-Conse-quentialist distinction. For Tsongkhapa and his followers take precisely thisnonevidence for entities being established through their own specific character-istics as the basis for spinning off the elaborations of most of their essential pointsin Centrism as well as their supposed consequences. It is consistently on the basisof this notion of “phenomena that are conventionally established through theirown specific characteristics” that they explain the nature of autonomous argu-The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 381Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 381"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"ments, the Autonomists’ distinction between the correct and false seeming, theassumed ontological and epistemological differences between Autonomists andConsequentialists, Autonomists’ failure to comprehend and negate the full rangeof the Consequentialists’ object of negation, their differing views on emptiness,and the resulting superiority of the latter over the former.891As Tillemans says:Tsong kha pa gives virtually no other argumentsworthy of the nameto prove that the Indian authors themselves had the positions on cus-tomary truth that he attributes to them, although he does consecratean enormous amount of energy to elaborating what these positionsare and what consequences they entail. This is in a way very typicalTsong kha pa: as is the case for his doctrine of “recognizing the objectto be refuted” (dgag bya ngos ‘dzin), he seems to have elaborated manyof his most fertile and sweeping philosophical ideas and interpretativeschemes on the basis of the slimmest, and sometimes even miscon-strued, Indian textual evidence.892Even Hopkins emphasizes “how thin, even how flimsy the evidence is,” but hetakes this very fact as the basis for praising Tsongkhapa’s interpretive skills. Insteadof acknowledging that Tsongkhapa makes a lot out of nothing, Hopkins just fol-lows Tsongkhapa in insisting that there indeed issubtle evidence for a differencein the view of emptiness between Autonomists and Consequentialists:More bluntly, one might say that the evidence for a difference in theview of emptiness between Candrakırti and Bh›vaviveka is so thin thateven great Indian scholars did not notice it. 893Through this, Hopkins even seems to support Tsongkhapa’s own modestclaim that there was only a single person in India—Candrakırti—and a singleperson in Tibet—himself—who actually realized the true meaning of Centrism,implying that all other great masters in India and Tibet were too dull to get thesupreme view in Buddhism. Quite absurdly, this would then apply even to theBuddha himself as well as N›g›rjuna, the acknowledged founder of Centrism.Pawo Rinpoche answers this claim with a question:However, if [it really were the case that] the teaching of the BlessedOne ⁄›kyamuni had liberated only one single human being in Indiaand one single human being in Tibet, then what kind of enlightenedactivity of the Blessed One [for the welfare of all sentient beings] is thissupposed to be?894382The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 382"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"One more example of Tsongkhapa’s approach here is the statement in hisEssence of Good Explanationsthat Autonomists and Consequentialists differ intheir views on emptiness. First, he acknowledges that Avalokitavrata, ⁄›ntarak ̋ita,and KamalaŸıla do not state any difference in terms of identitylessness betweenBh›vaviveka’s and their own systems on the one hand and those of Buddhap›litaand Candrakırti on the other. Then, Tsongkhapa continues by introducing acertain passage from Candrakırti’s autocommentary on the epilogue in hisEntrance into Centrism. He says:Candrakırti asserts [here] that, since Buddhap›lita has commented onthe intention of noble [N›g›rjuna] just as it is, there is no differencebetween this [comment by Buddhap›lita] and his own way of pre-senting the ultimate and the seeming. He explains that his own systemdiverges from the comments by other Centrists.895However, Candrakırti never mentions or quotes Buddhap›lita in his entire auto-commentary (neither in the passage Tsongkhapa explicitly quotes nor anywhereelse), let alone makes the assertion about Buddhap›lita that Tsongkhapa claimshe does.896The passage in question in Candrakırti’s text reads:Except in [N›g›rjuna’s]897Centrist treatise, this dharma called “empti-ness” is not expressed in an unmistaken way in other treatises. Like-wise, the approach [Tib. lugs] that is found here and which I explainedtogether with answers to objections by certain [other] approaches, inits conformity to the dharma of emptiness, does not exist in other trea-tises. I request the learned to gain certainty about this. Therefore, itshould be understood that the statement by some people, “It is justwhat the system of the SÒtra Followers propounds as the ultimate thatis asserted as the seeming by Centrists” is made only because of notreally understanding the true purport of the subject of [N›g›rjuna’s]Centrist treatise. Also, those who think, “What is propounded by theFollowers of the Great Exposition as the ultimate is [propounded] asthe seeming by Centrists” simply do not fully understand the true pur-port of the subject of [N›g›rjuna’s] Centrist treatise, since it is notappropriate that the supramundane dharma conforms to mundanedharmas. Thus, the learned should gain certainty that this approach[here] is uncommon.898Thus, Candrakırti does not speak about a difference with regard to the actualview or even the realization of emptiness (that is, ultimate reality) among Cen-trists. First, he only says in a general way that, just as N›g›rjuna’s unmistakenThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 383Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 383"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"presentation of emptiness, his own approach (since it accords with N›g›rjuna’steaching on emptiness) likewise does not exist in any other treatises. (As in thecase of N›g›rjuna, he does not specify these treatises, but most commentatorsgloss them as being the texts by other followers of N›g›rjuna.) Second, whatCandrakırti means by “his own approach” becomes clear through two points: (1)The two specific differences with other Centrists that he explicitly mentions inthis passage both address—in his eyes—mistaken ways in which some Centristspresent seeming reality. (2) In the next passage, he further glosses the supra-mundane dharma as “dependent origination.” He has someone ask whether ear-lier commentators such as Vasubandhu, Dign›ga, and Dharmap›la have rejectedthe meaning of the supramundane dharma of dependent origination as it isunmistakenly taught by N›g›rjuna and affirms that such is the case.899Hence, forCandrakırti, the difference between him and other Centrists—as well as otherBuddhist masters—obviously lies in whether seeming reality is presented as noth-ing but mere dependent origination (as N›g›rjuna clearly does) or as somethingreified, be it material particles or a really existing consciousness. The point isthat, in the latter case, the inseparable unity of dependent origination and empti-ness—seeming and ultimate reality—is missed.Having been thoroughly trained in the Gelugpa tradition himself, Dreyfusconcludes with regard to this issue:It is difficult to follow Tsong kha pa in his suggestion that the Sv›tan -trika and Pr›saºgika views of emptiness differ substantively. Tsongkha pa’s analysis is extremely sharp but suffers from a real gap in cred-ibility, which is well exposed by his critics when they argue that it ishard to believe that Candrakırti, who was a relatively obscure figureuntil the tenth or eleventh century, is to be considered the main inter-preter of N›g›rjuna, whereas the great Indian M›dhyamikas such asBh›va viveka and ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, who are counted as Sv›tantrika by mostTibetan scholars, are dismissed as having only a partial understandingof Madhyamaka. This conclusion is unlikely, and Tsong kha pa’s dis-cussion does not seem to meet the high burden of proof it wouldrequire.900Disagreeing with Tsongkhapa and his followers, the Eighth Karmapa andmany others make it clear not only that Bh›vaviveka, who initiated the Auton-omist system, nowhere explicitly asserts entities as being conventionally estab-lished through their own specific characteristics (a point even Tsongkhapaconcedes) but that such is not even implied in his writings. The Karmapa adducesa number of passages from Bh›vaviveka’s texts to support this. First, he says, ifthe Autonomists really claimed that the entities of the seeming level exist as specif-384The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 384"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"ically characterized phenomena, then how are the following statements inBh›vaviveka’sBlaze of Reasoning to be explained?[The aggregates and such] exist merely as imputed entities on the seem-ing level. As the Blissfully Gone One said:The three realms are just mere imputations.They do not exist as having the nature of entities.It is those with bad conceptions who thinkThat imputations are actual entities.Likewise:Form is like a ball of foam.Feelings resemble bubbles.Discrimination is like a mirage.Formations are equal to a banana tree.Consciousness is like an illusion.Thus spoke the one who sees true reality.901The same text in fact explicitly denies that entities are established through spe-cific characteristics:Some say, “Entities definitely have a nature, because they have char-acteristics. Nonexistents, such as the child of barren woman, do nothave characteristics.” This statement is not established. As I say:I do not assert that entities have a natureBecause of having characteristics.902Moreover, if Autonomists accepted something that is established as a specifi-cally characterized phenomenon, they would contradict themselves. Therefore,they do not accept this.Hence, the meaning of the reason is not established.It is even of opposite meaning.How is that? It has been taught earlier that entities are without nature.Hence, the meaning of the opponents’ reason “because they have char-acteristics” is not established for Centrists, because all phenomena arewithout characteristics. [Consequently,] the meaning of this reason iseven the opposite, since the meaning of the reason “because it is seenThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 385Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 385"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"that they have characteristics” is the opposite [of a reason] in order toestablish [entities] that are without nature, such as earth.903If entities were established through their own characteristics, one would haveto assert that, for example, solidity as the specific characteristic of earth isautonomously established through the actual way of being of earth as the objectin question. However, this is also refuted by Bh›vaviveka:It is not suitable that the characteristic of earthIs characterized as solidity through earth itself,Since it is a cause for the body consciousness,Just as it is not suitable [to be characterized] as such through fire.This is the refutation that [characteristics and the basis to which theypertain] are one. It is not suitable that the characteristic of earth ischaracterized as solidity through earth itself, since [solidity] is [just] acause for the arising of a body consciousness. This is just as unsuitableas, for example, the characteristic of fire being characterized as solid-ity through fire itself. . . . For example, how can you see that [some-one in a monastery] is a disciple in dependence on a vase [to refilloffering bowls], or a teacher in dependence on disciples? It is throughcarrying this vase that [someone] is characterized as a disciple, whereasit is by guiding disciples that [someone else] is characterized as ateacher [but neither of them is so characterized through themselves].904Despite certain claims to the contrary, according to Bh›vaviveka, characteris-tics and the basis to which they apply are not different either:The characteristics of an ox are not assertedBy the ox itself as a hump, a dewlap, and so on,Since they are imputed by a particular cognition,Just as the characteristics of a donkey.This is the refutation that [characteristics and the basis to which theyapply] are different, . . . just as one is not able to characterize the char-acteristics of a donkey through an ox.905Then follows the summary of refuting the existence of something that is foundas a specifically characterized entity through unmistaken valid cognition by negat-ing that any characteristic and the basis to which it pertains are neither the samenor different:386The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 386"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"So if they were one, how could anything be the characteristic,Since it does not characterize itself?If they are other, how could anything be the characteristic,Since one thing does not characterize something other?906The same is expressed in Bh›vaviveka’s Lamp of Knowledge:The nature of entitiesDoes not exist in conditions and such.“Entities” are eyes and so on. “The nature” is their specific character.907“Conditions” are sperm and egg and so on. . . . Since this [nature]does not exist, whose conditions would these conditions be?908Thus, there is abundant and easily understandable evidence in Bh›vaviveka’sworks that seeming entities are not established through their nature, their specificcharacter, or their specific characteristics, nor are they established as existentthrough other conditions. Considering this evidence, the Karmapa wonders whatresult is expected by putting so much effort into repeatedly claiming that “Auton-omists assert some specifically characterized entity that is conventionally estab-lished through the object’s own way of being,” although such an entity is nowhereto be found in their texts.In the same vein, Gorampa’s Elimination of Bad Viewssays:If Autonomists were to accept autonomous reasonings, since they mustprove phenomena that are established through their own specific char-acteristics, . . . it would absurdly follow that Autonomists prove a phe-nomenon that is established through its own specific characteristicswhen they prove the position that consists in the negation of arisingfrom the four extremes.909The Karmapa does not quote Bh›vaviveka’sJewel Lamp of Centrism, but thattext says again and again that all outer and inner entities are delusive and illu-sionlike. From causes and conditions that are mere imputations arise results thatare mere imputations. On seeming reality, we read:“Seeming” refers to entities, such as form, just as they appear. Theseare “real” inasmuch as they represent valid cognition from the per-spective of ordinary people and unmistaken worldly conventions.910Thus, it is made clear that “validity” refers only to the mistaken perspective ofThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 387Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 387"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"ordinary worldly people. It is only in this context then that Bh›vaviveka’s text doestalk about specific characteristics, but exclusively in terms of mere appearancesfrom this mistaken perspective as long as these are not analyzed:How is seeming reality?Seeming reality means to knowThe general and specific characteristicsOf all phenomena to be known.When this seeming just as it appearsIs examined through reasoning, nothing is found.The fact of not finding is the ultimate.Therefore, the seeming has to be understood [first].911Thus, from the context, it is obvious that there are no entities that are estab-lished by way of their “specific characteristics,” especially not through any validcognition that is other or better than what ordinary beings perceive as valid. Ina way, it is quite ironic that the only passage in Bh›vaviveka’s writings that at leastmentions the term “specific characteristics” (though not at all in Tsongkhapa’ssense) is denied by Tsongkhapa and his followers as being authored byBh›vaviveka, since they regard The Jewel Lamp of Centrismas the work of a laterauthor by the same name.912Also the Autonomist ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, in the context of analyzing for true reality,negates the general category of mere entities that are able to perform functions.By doing so, he demonstrates the implicit negation of any instance of this cate-gory of entities, be it a generally characterized or a specifically characterized entity.This negation includes any entity of a valid cognition as the means to establishother entities. As his own Commentary on The Ornament of Centrismsays:I did nothing but speak about all these [entities that are able to performfunctions] in a pretentious way. However, when those with realiza-tion analyze what is free from all ability to perform a function, thereis no such function whatsoever, because the ability to perform a func-tion is a conceptual object. Otherwise:What is the point, if what is not able to perform a functionIs examined by those who assert that it [is able to]?What is the benefit for lustful people to examineWhether a neuter has a nice body or not?Therefore, the learned say that “performing a function” is the defining388The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 388"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"characteristic of an entity. It is with regard to such [mere] appearingaspects of entities that personal and phenomenal identitylessness aretaught and their opposite—any superimposed nature—is negated,since the result that is called “the welfare of persons” depends onexactly this to come forth. As for anything else, there is neither proofnor negation, since [all of] this is just something that is to be left as itis. Thus, do not think, “It has not been taught that all objects that areentities are identityless and so on.”913The Karmapa adds that there are many further statements in other Autono-mist texts that the seeming does not exist as something real that is establishedthrough its own specific characteristics on the seeming level.In her thorough analysis, McClintock clearly brings out the difference betweenKedrub Je’s understanding of autonomous reasoning and ⁄›ntarak ̋ita’s andKamalaŸıla’s approach. She says:⁄›ntarak ̋ita and KamalaŸıla have a different understanding of auto -nomous inference, one that dispenses with the metalogical require-ment that all elements in the inference be established as appearingsimilarly (mthun snang du grub pa) as mKhas grub understands thisrequirement. . . . mKhas grub’s argument depends, in part, on the idea that the subjectin an autonomous inference must be established as appearing com-monly for both parties in the debate. And here, as in the commen-taries, we find ⁄›ntarak ̋ita and KamalaŸıla insisting that theirMadhyamaka arguments are not open to the charge of subject failureprecisely because the subject of the arguments appears in the awarenessof both parties to the debate. But there is an important distinctionbetween the two formulations of what it means to appear commonly,for mKhas grub rje specifically requires that the subject be establishedas appearing commonly according to the philosophical systems(lugs) ofboth the proponent and the opponent, while ⁄›ntarak ̋ita emphasizesthat inferences should be formulated “having precludedthe varioussubjects that are produced through mutually incompatible philosoph-ical systems.” . . . Entities that have been qualified in ways that arisethrough philosophical theorizing . . . are purposefully and emphaticallyexcluded from being the subject of a debate.914McClintock calls the levels of SÒtra Followers, Yog›c›ras, and Centrists asthey are used in the texts by ⁄›ntarak ̋ita and KamalaŸıla “sliding scales of analy-The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 389Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 389"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"sis.” In their flexible approach, these Autonomist masters use different reasonswhen faced with different opponents, thus only provisionally employing certainsubjects, predicates, and reasons on the respectively lower levels of analysis, whichbecome gradually negated on the higher levels. This very approach is also clearlydescribed by Mipham Rinpoche in his commentary on The Ornament of Cen-trism, where he explains the five special points of this text.915In this model of“sliding scales of analysis,” just like the two preceding scales of SÒtra Followersand Yog›c›ras, also the scale of Centrist analysis clearly still belongs to the levelof conventionalanalysis. As the Eighth Karmapa, Mipham Rinpoche, andMcClintock point out, it is on this level that Autonomists deny any conven-tional existence (let alone ultimate existence) of real entities, be these material ormental, with specific characteristics or without. Thus, it seems that Kedrub Jefailed to properly evaluate this system of different levels of analysis by theseAutonomist masters. Tillemans comments:One of the most extraordinary ideas in Tsong kha pa and the dGelugs pa tradition is that Sv›tantrika philosophers not only accept thatcustomary things are established intrinsically, from their own side,etc., but in so doing end up in a very subtle way being likerealists, i.e.,“advocates of real entities” (dngos smra ba), and hence essentially inthe same camp as all lower Buddhist schools and perhaps even non-Buddhists. Of course, Tsong kha pa is not saying that Sv›tantrikas arethemselves dngos smra ba. Nonetheless, the rapprochementis very clear.. . . As we see in the quote from Tsong kha pa . . . the realist (dngos smraba) and Sv›tantrika supposedly do not differ so much in their ontol-ogy, i.e., whatthey accept as existing, but instead on the level of truthto which this ontology is assigned . . . And in key contexts concerningthe Sv›tantrika-Pr›saºgika debates, the Sv›tantrika areregularlygrouped together with the lower Buddhist schools under the designa-tion rang rgyud pa man chad(“[thinkers] from Sv›tantrika on down”),these all being contrasted with the Pr›saºgika. Odd as it may seem tous, Tsong kha pa and his followers, in effect, divided all Buddhist phi-losophy into two significant camps: realists and Sv›tantrikas on theone hand and Pr›saºgikas on the other.916In light of all this, one wonders whether Tsongkhapa still considers Autono-mists to be Centrists. In his Essence of Good Explanations, he has someone ask thisquestion and answers:These learned ones are also Centrists, since they negate the philo-sophical systems of really existent phenomena through many reason-390The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 390"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"ings and accept [phenomena] to be not really existent. This is not incontradiction to [Candrakırti’s] statement that it is not suitable forCentrists to employ autonomous [reasoning], just as it is not suitablefor fully ordained monks917with vows to act contrary to these vows, butthe mere [fact of] acting contrary to them does not necessarily meanthat they are not fully ordained monks.918If this example refers to monks actually breaking their vows in a repeated andintentional way, what kind of monks are they supposed to be? If the examplemeans only committing minor infractions of the vows that can be restored, thedifferences between Autonomists and Consequentialists cannot be as numerousand substantial as Tsongkhapa usually claims them to be. It is noteworthy thathere he focuses solely on their difference in methodology. After having empha-sized their many ontological and epistemological differences at length (such as adifferent view on emptiness), he does not mention any of them here and down-plays the single methodological difference of using autonomous reasoning as notwithstanding the Autonomists’ ranking as Centrists. Considered together, this islike saying, “I have shown you all the many big differences between a rubberduck and an actual duck, but the mere fact that the former makes sounds that arenot typical of ducks does not mean that it is not a duck.” Thus, Tsongkhapadoes not really address the issue that the substantial differences he ascribes toAutonomists and Consequentialists seriously call into question the Autonomists’identity as Centrists. To sum up, the Karmapa says that for Consequentialists there are no posi-tions or arguments to be formulated with regard to any phenomena in the senseof entities that are established through valid cognition by either naïve beings ornoble ones on any level of the two realities. Therefore, the Consequentialist sys-tem is free from taking up any thesis whatsoever. Nevertheless, many peoplestubbornly keep saying, “Since you Consequentialists do not take up any posi-tion, it follows that you say you have no position” and then proclaim, “In thatcase, this becomes your position.” There is an answer to this. Since Consequen-tialists realize that no phenomenon or entity is established through valid cogni-tion, anything to be expressed about such phenomena by terms or concepts ismeaningless. Nevertheless, for the sake of eliminating the superimpositions anddenials in terms of existence and nonexistence of others, Consequentialists wishto pronounce something by terms and concepts from the perspective of theseothers in order to invalidate their wrong views. In fact, it is solely for this reasonthat they pronounce anything at all. However, even during this whole process,they never think, “We do not take up any position.” Thus, while not entertain-ing even the faintest mental flux, how could it possibly follow that they voice theirnot having a position as a position?The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 391Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 391"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Some people might object, “For Consequentialists, there is nothing to bepresented as a system of their own that is established through valid cognition.Hence, it must follow that there are also no absurd consequences for them thatinvalidate the positions of others, since they do not have any thought of wishingto pronounce these consequences. On the other hand, if they have such thoughtsof wishing to pronounce consequences, there must equally arise in them the men-tal state of wishing to pronounce the positions that are the opposites of theseconsequences. And if such a mental state arises, there is no way not to take up byterms and concepts the positions that are the opposites of these consequences.”This is not the case, since Consequentialists indeed have the wish to pronouncesomething for the sake of eliminating the wrong ideas of others. However, ifthere is no case of them taking up a position that is an expression of any wrongideas of their own, what is wrong with that? When Consequentialists pronouncearguments or examples, this can be compared to a physician with clear visionoperating on the eyes of someone with cataracts. The physician wishes to use asurgical scalpel to open up the patient’s eyes, which are covered by turbidities, andin fact does open them. However, the physician, who has clear vision, does notneed to have the wish to open her own eyes in this way.Still, some people insist that the very fact of not having a position representsa position. In this case, the Karmapa says, why should they then not equally con-clude that a nonimplicative negation itself is an implicative negation, or hope thatthe very fact of no rain falling is the falling of rain?TThe Origin of the Controversy between Autonomists and ConsequentialistsThe starting point for what came to be called the Autonomist-Consequentialistdistinction was in fact rather limited. It is to be found in Bh›vaviveka’s critiqueof Buddhap›lita’s way of commenting on N›g›rjuna’sFundamental VersesI.1:Not from themselves, not from something other,Not from both, and not without a cause—At any place and any time,All entities lack arising.Subsequently, Candrakırti defended Buddhap›lita and rebutted Bh›vaviveka. Itwas only later in Tibet that especially Candrakırti’s statements were commentedon and elaborated on very extensively.392The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 392"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"Showing That Buddhap›lita Has No FlawBuddhap›lita’s PositionBuddhap›lita’s commentary on N›g›rjuna’s verse starts with negating the firstpossibility of arising:Entities do not arise from their own intrinsic nature, because theirarising would be pointless and because they would arise endlessly. Forentities that [already] exist as their own intrinsic nature, there is noneed to arise again. If they were to arise despite existing [already], therewould be no time when they do not arise; [but] that is also not asserted[by the Enumerators].919Buddhap›lita briefly continues in a similar style to negate the remaining threepossibilities. He says that entities do not arise from something other, becausethen everything could arise from everything. They do not arise from both them-selves and others, since this possibility just combines the flaws of the two previ-ous ones. They also do not arise without any cause, because, again, everythingcould arise from everything and all undertakings would be pointless.The Karmapa’s Chariot of the Tagbo Siddhasadds what is found in the texts ofearly Tibetan Centrists on the meaning of Buddhap›lita’s negation of the firstpossibility of arising. Whether Buddhap›lita’s phrase “entities do not arise fromthemselves” is formulated as an autonomous reasoning or as a consequence, inany case, it is a correct position to invalidate others. However, it is not a correctposition in the sense of t something to be presented as the Centrists’ own system.From the Enumerators’ assertion that entities arise from themselves, it simply fol-lows that such arising is pointless and endless, because these entities exist already,just like a clearly manifest vase. But the Enumerators cannot accept this conse-quence, since it is based on precisely what they seek to maintain. In an analysisof the above quote from Buddhap›lita’s text in terms of this consequence, theword “their” in his reason clause above (“because theirarising would be pointlessand because they would arise endlessly”) should be taken as the example (a clearlymanifest vase), the reason (already existing), and the predicate (such arising ispointless and endless), while the repeated occurrence of the word “because” in thisreason clause is notthe reason in Buddhap›lita’s consequence. The passage thatstarts with “For entities that already exist as their own intrinsic nature” is thedetailed explanation of this. Simply put, it means, “Entities do not arise fromthemselves, because they already exist as their own intrinsic nature, just as theclearly manifest vase in front of us.” Bh›vaviveka, however, has misunderstoodthis structure of Buddhap›lita’s statement.920The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 393Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 393"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Bh›vaviveka’s CritiqueBh›vaviveka’s Lamp of Knowledge(his own commentary on N›g›rjuna’s text)first presents his own probative argument to negate that entities arise from them-selves:It is certain that, ultimately, the inner sources do not arise from them-selves, because they exist [already]—just like an existent conscious-ness.921This is the same basic argument as is implied in Buddhap›lita’s consequence,yet Bh›vaviveka goes on to criticize Buddhap›lita’s way of negating that entitiesarise from themselves:This [refutation by Buddhap›lita] is inappropriate, (1) because he doesnot state a reason and an example, (2) because he fails to eliminate the[possible] flaws adduced by others [against him], and (3) because it isa [consequential] statement that affords an opportunity [for objectionsby an opponent].922The [third reason] means that, through reversal ofthe meaning stated [in Buddhap›lita’s consequence], a probandumand a reason with reversed meanings would appear. Thus, entitieswould arise from something other, because their arising would be fruit-ful and because their arising would come to an end. [However, this]would contradict [Buddhap›lita’s own] position.923In an analogous way, Bh›vaviveka criticizes the arguments of Buddhap›lita withregard to the possibilities of arising from something other and without any cause(he offers no comment on the latter’s negation of arising from both).924The Eighth Karmapa elaborates on Bh›vaviveka’s criticism by asking whether,there being no arising of entities from themselves, Buddhap›lita’s formulation of“it being pointless” and so on is an autonomous probative argument or the con-struction of a consequence.If it is meant as an autonomous probative argument, it is highly inappropri-ate as such because (1) it does not state the standard branches of a proof. Theseare the reason (as the subject property) that entities do not arise from themselves(“because they exist already”) and an example that illustrates that the reasonentails the predicate (such as Bh›vaviveka’s own example “just like an existentconsciousness”). (2) Buddhap›lita’s formulation is furthermore inappropriatebecause it fails to eliminate the possible flaws that may be adduced by othersagainst him. These are the following two flaws with regard to the position andthe reason. The Enumerators may say, “If you Buddhists mean to prove the posi-394The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 394"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"tion that `something that exists as bearing the intrinsic nature of its result doesnot arise,’ you just prove what is already established for us, since we too do notassert that existing results arise. And if you understand your reason to mean,`because the arising of something that exists as bearing the intrinsic nature of itscause is pointless,’ it amounts to a reason that proves the opposite of what youwant to prove, since it is precisely what we say, which is that all that arises existsas its cause.”(3) If Buddhap›lita’s formulation is meant as a consequence, through the rever-sal of the meaning stated, a probandum and a reason with reversed meaningswould appear. This means that such a consequence would imply that entitiesarise from something other, because their arising is fruitful and comes to an end.Thus, since Centrists do not set forth these three positions, such a consequencewould contradict their position.The writings of early Tibetan Centrists comment that it is Bh›vaviveka’s andothers’ fancy to say, “Since a negation must necessarily imply its opposite, if aris-ing from itself is reversed, there is no way not to accept arising from somethingother instead. This fact that a consequence implies its opposite is present in allphilosophical systems.” A good response to this criticism was given by the greatConsequentialist master Mah›sumati, when he arrived in Tibet and was asked byTibetan teachers, “Is the Centrist philosophical system good in itself?” Heanswered, “A philosophical system is called a view, and all views are preciselywhat is to be relinquished. Therefore, when Centrists do not assert that a conse-quence implies its opposite, they merely do not accept what pervades all foolishphilosophical systems like an infectious disease. Thus, it seems that calling justthis approach `a good philosophical system’ means giving it a bad name.”In the systems of those who, like Bh›vaviveka, accept an implicit proof by aconsequence, such consequences would impel an autonomous argument as tothe reversed meaning.925However, as for Buddhap›lita’s and others’ pronounce-ment of invalidating consequences, since it is not connected with any wish to statethe reversed meaning of such consequences, they cannot be reversed, no matterhow hard one tries. This can be compared to a weapon that is hurled at a person,flies through space, and hits this person. Even if the person reverses the weaponand tries to hurl it back at space to hit it, the person will not be able to hit space.Thus, Bh›vaviveka’s refutation of Buddhap›lita was made without understand-ing the intention of the latter, who first simply considered, “It is implied in theEnumerators’ position that entities do not arise from themselves, because thiswould be pointless and endless.” However, once he had hurled the unwantedconsequences as formulated in these two reasons at the Enumerators, Bud-dhap›lita continued to invalidate the position of the Enumerators by formulat-ing further absurd consequences using their other claims as reasons.The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 395Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 395"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Candrakırti’s Defense of Buddhap›lita and Rebuttal of Bh›vaviveka’s CritiqueThe first chapter of Candrakırti’s Lucid Wordspresents most of Buddhap›lita’sarguments above as well as all of Bh›vaviveka’s critique of them. Candrakırti’sdetailed rebuttal of Bh›vaviveka’s position, however, focuses on what the latterexplains concerning the first possibility of arising. This rebuttal, Candrakırti sayslater, equally applies to what Bh›vaviveka explains concerning the remainingpossibilities. The sections that follow here are based on Candrakırti’s texttogether with the Eighth Karmapa’s commentary.9261) There is no flaw in not stating an example and a reason, since Centrists do not pro-nounce autonomous reasonings that are established through valid cognition as theirown system.927Candrakırti declares that Bh›vaviveka’s entire critique of Buddhap›lita isunfounded. He starts with the former’s accusation (1) that the latter “does notstate a reason and an example.” He says that the Centrists’ own system does notstate a reason and an example that are established through valid cognition but thatthis is not a fault. He explains why by saying that the system of Centrists meansto be free from all discursiveness—including valid cognition—on both levels ofreality. This does not prevent Centrists from stating reasons and examples thatare acknowledged by others, as will be explained further below. However, in thecase of the Enumerators who assert that entities arise from themselves, it is pos-sible to put an end to their wrong ideas by just confronting them with the inter-nal contradictions of their position.928“Arising from itself” means that the cause itself exists as bearing the samenature as the result and that it is this same cause that arises. To say that “entitiesarise from themselves, because they arise from being existent as themselves” iscontradictory to the reason entailing the predicate, since something already exis-tent is supposed to arise, which is pointless. And if what already exists were nev-er theless to arise in this way, one should see its endless arising. Theseconsequences cannot be accepted by the Enumerators, since they do not assertthat something that has arisen is what arises again, nor that it keeps arising end-lessly. Therefore, their position is both without justification and self-contradic-tory.Thus, the Enumerators are challenged by just these consequences that demon-strate the internal contradictions of their system and have the same effect ofnegating arising from itself as the autonomous arguments and examples of some-one who chooses the Autonomist approach. The crucial question here is whetherthe Enumerators, upon being confronted with the contradictions between whatthey want to prove in their philosophical system and the means to prove it, accept396The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 396"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"their self-contradictions. After all, the direct function of absurd consequences isto make one realize internal contradictions, while their implicit function is tomake one drop a philosophical system that involves such self-contradictions.929However, if some opponents are so shamelessly stubborn as not to withdrawfrom their positions once they are confronted with the contradictions in thosepositions, they will also not withdraw from them even if provided with furtherautonomous arguments and examples that are established through valid cogni-tion in one’s own system. As Candrakırti says, Centrists do not debate with theinsane. Thus, by putting forth inferences that are established through one’s ownsystem, Bh›vaviveka just displays his fondness for such inferences even whenthey are out of place.2) Since Centrists do not formulate consequences that impel an autonomous argu-ment of reversed meaning, there is no contradiction to what they accept.930For Centrists, it is inappropriate to make any autonomous inferences on theirown account, because they do not accept any other theses either. In other words,Centrists do not posit any unmistaken consciousness that realizes something tobe inferred that is established through some valid cognition in their own system.For they also do not accept any other thesis different from such unmistakenness,that is, something established as mistaken through some valid cognition in theirown system. Centrists do not find anything that they feel could be presented asan inference that is thoroughly grounded in their own system. Rather, instead ofseeing a need to present some—anyway nonexistent—thoroughly establishedinferences of the systems of others merely in order to find something that theycould present as an established inference, Centrists always say that presentingsuch is categorically to be avoided. As firyadeva’s Four Hundred Versesexplains:Against someone who has no thesisOf “existence, nonexistence, or [both] existence and nonexistence,”It is not possible to level a charge,Even if [such is tried] for a long time.931N›g›rjuna’s Rebuttal of Objectionssays:If I had any position,I thereby would be at fault.Since I have no position,I am not at fault at all.If there were anything to be observedThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 397Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 397"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Through direct perception and the other instances [of valid cognition],It would be something to be established or rejected.However, since no such thing exists, I cannot be criticized.932In other words, if Centrists had any position of the nature of an existing ornonexistent entity being established through valid cognition on either level of thetwo realities in their own system, they would thereby incur the two faults of (1)not formulating a reason and an example and (2) failing to eliminate the possi-ble flaws that may be adduced by others against them. However, for Centrists,the ultimate means freedom from all discursiveness and the seeming means mereappearances that are presented in contingency. Apart from this, on any level ofthe two realities, they do not have any position that is established through validcognition in their own system as such and such. Therefore they are not at faultin not formulating a reason and an example for entities not arising from them-selves. If, through the four kinds of valid cognition, there were any phenomenalentity to be observed as being established, there would be something to be estab-lished or rejected in their own system. However, since no such thing exists, Cen-trists cannot be criticized for incurring the above flaws.3) Since Centrists do not state reasons and such that are established through validcognition as their own system, there is no need for them to eliminate possible flawswith regard to a position and a reason that are solely stated from the perspective of aproponent who has such positions and reasons.933As Centrists simply do not state any autonomous inferences, how could theyhave an autonomous thesis like Bh›vaviveka’s that says, “The inner sources do notarise from themselves”? Against such a thesis, the Enumerators could well retort,“What does your thesis mean? Does `from themselves’ mean `from the intrinsicnature of the result’ or `from the intrinsic nature of the cause’? If it means `fromthe intrinsic nature of the result,’ you just prove what is already established forus, since we too do not assert that existing results arise. If it means `from theintrinsic nature of the cause,’ it amounts to a reason that proves the opposite ofwhat you want to prove, since we say that all that arises exists as the intrinsicnature of the cause.” Centrists do not have to eliminate such flaws, because theirpronouncement “Arising from itself does not exist” is merely meant as an inval-idation of the assertion, “Arising from itself exists” as being something that isestablished through valid cognition in someone else’s system. However, Cen-trists do not put forward a “nonexistence of arising from itself” that is in anyway established through valid cognition in their own system.Also, how could Centrists have the reason “because they exist already” (asstated by Bh›vaviveka) as something that is established through valid cognition398The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 398"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"in their own system? This would only involve the above flaws of proving what isalready established or proving the opposite and thus commit them to struggle inorder to eliminate these two flaws. But if they do not have any such theses or rea-sons, why would they have to eliminate any of their fallacies? If there is no har-vest, there is no need to protect it from hailstorms. In brief, since Centrists arenot susceptible to the above flaws alleged by others, Buddhap›lita did not needto specify any answers to such flaws.4) Despite not making any assertions of their own, Centrists possess reasons, examples,and so on for the sake of invalidating the positions of others.934Someone like Bh›vaviveka might think, “According to the Consequentialists,since there is no thesis, reason, or example that is established through valid cog-nition in their own system, they do not state autonomous inferences. Therefore,they neither establish the content of the thesis that consists in the negation of aris-ing from itself nor eliminate the position of others through an inference that isestablished through valid cognition for both parties in the debate. However, tak-ing into account the need to explicitly express the contradictions within the posi-tions of others that come about through their own inferences, it is precisely fromthe perspective of the opponents themselves that there must be a thesis as well asa reason and an example (for the logical entailment) that are free from possibleflaws. However, Buddhap›lita did not express such a reason and example that areestablished in his own system and did also not eliminate the flaws of the position.Hence, he incurs both the flaw of not providing a reason and an example capa-ble of negating arising from itself and the flaw of not eliminating the above fal-lacies as under point (3) above that an Enumerator may bring up against histhesis of `entities not arising from themselves.’”Candrakırti’s reply is that none of these flaws applies to Buddhap›lita. Indebate, those (such as the Enumerators) who hold a position (such as arisingfrom itself) out of the wish to generate a certainty in others that is just like theirown certainty935must demonstrate to the other party the justification on thegrounds of which the content of this position is understood. Therefore, it is theprocedure of people who have philosophical systems that the proof of the con-tent of a position (such as arising from itself) which is accepted by a certain per-son should be advanced by just this person. This means that, as the next step afterthe Centrists’ statement of consequences, it is the Enumerators’ task to eliminatethe flaw in their own position that is exposed by the Centrists (who do not assertthat something already existent arises). This flaw is expressed in the entailmentof the predicate by the reason in the Centrists’ absurd consequence, “It followsthat entities do not arise from themselves, because they exist already” (which usesa reason and an example acknowledged by others). In other words, it is not theThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 399Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 399"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Centrists’ job to provide some probative arguments—be they autonomous orjust acknowledged by others—but the opponents’ job to address the faults intheir own position. However, when the Enumerators try to do so, it becomes allthe more obvious that they do not have any valid reasons to eliminate the flawexposed by Centrists and thereby prove that entities arise from themselves. Noneof the reasons that the Enumerators might adduce to eliminate their fault arevalid reasons for Centrists. Nor are any of their other reasonings, such as “Enti-ties arise from themselves, because they cannot arise from nothing. Hence, exis-tents must arise from existents, as in the case of sesame oil existing in and comingforth from sesame seeds, while not existing in and coming forth from sand.”Rather, since they have no reason or example for their own position that entitiesarise from themselves, the arguments that they advance to prove its content allcome down to being nothing but this very position.936Since the Enumeratorsclaim a thesis that is devoid of any justification either by sheer conventional,worldly standards or through logical reasoning, their reasoning is just self-deceiv-ing. Consequently, their reasoning cannot generate any certainty in other personsthat entities arise from themselves.If Centrists thus do not put forward “their own” reasonings, how is the asser-tion of the Enumerators invalidated? Candrakırti says that the clearest invalida-tion of their position is precisely the fact that they are not able to prove itscontent. So what would be the need here to point out its invalidation through aninference of the Centrists’ own system?Someone like Bh›vaviveka might still object: “Still, the fault of the Enumera-tors contradicting themselves through their own inferences must undoubtedly beexpressed by Consequentialists like Buddhap›lita.” Although Consequentialistsdo not state reasons and examples that are established through valid cognition astheir own system, it is not the case that they, from the perspective of others, donot pronounce reasons and examples that are acknowledged by others, nor dothey fail to eliminate the flaw of proving what is already established for the oppo-nent. In fact, Candrakırti says, this is just what Buddhap›lita did. What the lat-ter had in mind was the following statement:(1) “Entities do not arise from themselves, because they already exist as theirown intrinsic nature, just as the clearly manifest vase that sits in front of us.”Based on this, he then made the well-known explicit statement in his com-mentary that was quoted above:(2) (a) “Entities do not arise from their own intrinsic nature, because theirarising would be pointless and because they would arise endlessly. (b) For enti-400The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 400"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"ties that [already] exist as their own intrinsic nature, there is no need to ariseagain. (c) If they were to arise despite [already] existing, there would be no timewhen they do not arise, [but] that is also not asserted.”So how does statement (2) teach the reason and the example of reasoning (1)that he had in mind? Candrakırti takes the word “their” in the reason clause in (2a)to indicate the reason “they already exist as their own intrinsic nature” in (1). Infact, (2b) is Buddhap›lita’s commentary on his brief statement (2a). Also, (2b)implicitly indicates the concordant example (a clearly manifest vase) that isacknowledged by the Enumerators and possesses the properties of both what is tobe proven (entities do not arise from themselves) and the means of proof (alreadyexisting as their own intrinsic nature). “Already existing as their own intrinsicnature” in (2b) identifies the reason. “Because their arising would be pointless” in(2a) identifies the predicate of what is to be proven (not arising from themselves)by drawing an unwanted consequence (that it is pointless for existents to ariseagain) from the opponent’s claim to be negated (arising from themselves).Take the following example of a classical Indian five-membered probativeargument:[1, thesis] Sound is an impermanent phenomenon [2, reason] becausewhat is produced is impermanent. It is seen that what is produced isimpermanent, [3, example] just as in the case of a vase. Likewise, [4,application] sound is produced. [5, conclusion] Therefore, because ofbeing produced, sound is an impermanent phenomenon.In the same way, Buddhap›lita too provides a probative argument:[1, thesis] Entities like vases and so on do not arise from their own intrin-sic nature [2, reason] because it would be pointless for something alreadyexisting as its own intrinsic nature to arise again. It is seen that whatalready exists as its own intrinsic nature does not depend on its repeatedarising from itself, [3, example] just as in the case of a manifest vase andso on. [4, application] Likewise, you Enumerators assume that some-thing like a vase exists as its own intrinsic nature even in its previous stateas a lump of clay. [5, conclusion] Then, for something that exists as itsown intrinsic nature even at that time, there is no arising.937In this way, the reason “already existing as its own intrinsic nature” is revealed inthe above application (4). This reason is unmistaken with regard to negating thatentities (re)arise from themselves. Through this reason (which is accepted by theThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 401Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 401"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Enumerators themselves), it is pointed out that the Enumerators contradict them-selves through their own inferences. Therefore, how can Bh›vaviveka say, “Thisrefutation by Buddhap›lita is inappropriate, because he does not state a reasonand an example”? Thus, not only is it not the case that Buddhap›lita did not state a reason andan example, but he also did not fail to eliminate the two possible flaws that maybe adduced by the Enumerators. These two flaws are, first, that the reason iscontradictory to what it is supposed to prove and, second, proving a positionthat is already established for the opponent. The first flaw is eliminated becausethe Enumerators do not assert that a vase, present in front of them and havingthe nature of being clearly manifest, manifests again. Hence, such a manifest vaseis established as the proper example that concords with Buddhap›lita’s reason (inthat it already exists) and his predicate (in that it does not arise again from itself).The second flaw is eliminated because what is to be proven here by Buddhap›litais specified as the negation of the arising of a potentialvase whose nature—accord-ing to the Enumerators—it is to be unmanifest and to have the causal potentialof producing a manifest vase. The negation of the arising of a potential vase is notwhat is already established for the Enumerators. Instead, they only accept thenonarising of an already manifest vase, but they assume that a potential vase doesarise into a manifest vase.Furthermore, the subject in Buddhap›lita’s unpacked probative argument isformulated as “entities like vases and so on.” Since the words “and so on” includeall entities that are asserted as arising, the reason does not contain the flaw ofbeing uncertain by way of not covering all other entities besides vases.In brief, this reason that negates that entities arise from themselves does notfall under any of the three categories of pseudoreasons (nonapplying, contradic-tory, or uncertain).938Candrakırti continues by providing an alternative probative argument to thesame effect of negating that entities arise from themselves. This argument followsfrom the Enumerators’ own description of the elements of reality. From amongtheir set of twenty-five such elements, “the person,”939or “spirit,” is said to existin and by itself, that is, independently of the primal substance.940The remainingtwenty-four elements are either this primal substance itself or just its variousmanifestations. Thus, the probative argument reads:The objects different from the person that the Enumerators claim tobe arising from themselves (that is, from the primal substance as theirintrinsic nature) do not arise from themselves, because they alreadyexist as their own intrinsic nature, just like the person.Not too surprisingly, a hypothetical Bh›vaviveka might wonder at this point,402The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 402"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"“Considering that Buddhap›lita’s original consequence does not state any ofwhat you have said, how did you get to your analysis?” Candrakırti answers thatBuddhap›lita’s above statements are full of (implied) meaning (in that they relyon the actual meaning instead of mere words). They are of few words but greatimport. Therefore, their words contain the above-mentioned content and thuslead to these detailed statements about it. When explained, the original wordsyield the nature of this content. Hence, nothing of what was explained aboveshould be regarded as not indicated by Buddhap›lita.5) A reversed meaning of consequences is not related to the Centrists but only to oth-ers, such as the Enumerators.941Next, Candrakırti addresses the third flaw that Bh›vaviveka ascribes to Bud-dhap›lita (that the latter’s consequence affords the opportunity for objectionsby the opponent). This means that the reversed meaning of his consequencebecomes revealed, which shows in the appearance of a probandum and a reasonwith reversed meanings. Thus, according to Bh›vaviveka, Buddhap›lita’s conse-quence that “entities do not arise from themselves, because their arising wouldbe pointless and because they would arise endlessly” implies that entities arisefrom something other, because their arising is fruitful and comes to an end. Allof this, he says, is contradictory to Buddhap›lita’s own position.Candrakırti says that the reversed meaning of consequences is related only tothe opponents (in this case the Enumerators), never to Centrists, because they donot have any position of their own (such as any of the four possibilities of aris-ing). This includes not having any reasons to prove a position or any of the threemodes of a reason that are established through any kind of valid cognition intheir own system. So how should there be any contradiction to any philosophi-cal system of their own? In fact, the whole spectrum of the many flaws of self-con-tradiction that come about for the opponent through the reversal of consequencesis just what Centrists wish for. So how then could master Buddhap›lita as a fol-lower of the unmistaken system of master N›g›rjuna have made a statement thataffords the opportunity for objections by opponents?It might be said, “Since it is Centrists who pronounce these consequences, theflaws related to their reversal must be theirs too.” According to Candrakırti, ifCentrists (who speak of the lack of nature of all phenomena) adduce a conse-quence for realists (who claim that all phenomena have a nature), how couldthere follow for the former a reversed meaning of the consequences that theystated, since they do not at all pronounce them out of the wish to imply theirreverse? Words do not overpower their speaker, unlike people with sticks andlassos who could force someone to do or say certain things. Rather, inasmuch aswords have the capacity to demonstrate a certain meaning, they conform to whatThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 403Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 403"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"the speaker wants to say. When Centrists adduce consequences that expose theopponents’ internal contradictions, these consequences solely have the effect ofnegating the opponents’ position. Hence, there is no reversed meaning of theseconsequences for the Centrists who pronounce them.9426) N›g›rjuna also invalidates the positions of others by mainly employing conse-quences.943Candrakırti continues by giving examples from The Fundamental Versestoshow that N›g›rjuna also eliminates the theses of others mostly by means ofadducing consequences.Prior to the characteristics of space,Space does not exist in the slightest.If it did [exist] prior to its characteristics,It would follow that it is without its characteristics.If there were form apart from the cause of form,It would follow that form is without a cause.However, nowhere is there any objectThat is without a cause.Nirv› ̊a is not an entity,[For] it would follow that it has the characteristics of aging and dying.There is no entityWithout aging and dying.944N›g›rjuna occasionally also negates the positions of others through an alter-native method. For the sake of invalidating the theses of his opponents, he takesthe meaning of a consequence unwanted for them as the probandum and thenstates how this probandum includes their own thesis.The Blessed One has saidThat any deceptive phenomenon is delusive.All conditioned phenomena are deceptive phenomena.Therefore, they are delusive.945Candrakırti’s Lucid Wordscomments:As for deceptive phenomena, they are what appears as beguiling andmistaken, just like a circling firebrand. Through not being of a nature404The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 404"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"of their own, all conditioned phenomena are delusive, because theyare deceptive phenomena, just like the water of a mirage. What is realis an undeceptive phenomenon, such as nirv› ̊a. Hence, due to the rea-sonings and quotations that were demonstrated, it is established thatentities lack a nature, since [also] the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrassay:All phenomena are empty, which is due to their mode of beingof lacking a nature.946The Karmapa adds that certain Tibetans say, “Consequentialists formulateconsequences that negate the assertion that phenomena have a nature and makestatements that establish such a negation. However, they never formulate pro-bative arguments that establish the lack of nature [itself], because, if they did,Consequentialists would become Autonomists.” Since there are many otherinstances such as the above in the words of N›g›rjuna and Candrakırti, he says,these Tibetans should think well about the meaning of these words before mak-ing such unfounded and suspect statements of their own.As for the absence of formal probative arguments and the use of consequences,Bh›vaviveka’s own commentary says that the words of N›g›rjuna imply manyprobative arguments.947So Candrakırti asks him why he does not consider Bud-dhap›lita’s consequences in the same way. It is Bh›vaviveka’s own style of com-menting on N›g›rjuna that implies the answer that Candrakırti makes him give:“It is the approach of commentators to extensively formulate probative argu-ments.” However, Candrakırti retorts, this is particularly untrue in the case ofN›g›rjuna, since the latter did not formulate probative arguments when he com-mented on his own Rebuttal of Objections.948All of this is closely linked to the question of what kind of negation—implica-tive or nonimplicative—Centrists use. As was explained earlier, all Centrists agreethat the negations that they formulate when analyzing for the ultimate are exclu-sively nonimplicative negations. This is explicitly stated several times in the com-mentaries on The Fundamental Versesby both Bh›vaviveka949and Candrakırti,950even with specific reference to the negation of entities arising from themselves.This fact alone should already suffice to show that Bh›vaviveka’s third flawascribed to Buddhap›lita is unjustified. For Buddhap›lita’s consequences areclearly nonimplicative negations, which is underlined by the fact that he—justlike N›g›rjuna—exhaustively negates all four possibilities of arising. Moreover,when commenting on N›g›rjuna’s own consequences in The Fundamental Verses,Bh›vaviveka explicitly regards them as negating one alternative without imply-ing any other or committing N›g›rjuna to their reversed meaning.951But whenhe turns to Buddhap›lita’s consequences, as we have seen, he takes the exactopposite stance.

This approach becomes theground for incurring a great many fallacies. Recall that when commenting onentities not arising from themselves, Bh›vaviveka had stated the following pro-bative argument:It is certain that, ultimately, the inner sources do not arise from them-selves, because they exist [already]—just as an existent consciousness.Exposing the Many Fallacies in This Approach9541) The fallacies in the qualification “ultimately”To start, Candrakırti asks whether the qualification “ultimately” in the abovereasoning is meant to apply to the predicate or the subject.a) The three fallacies if “ultimately” applies to the predicateFirst, Bh›vaviveka might say: “I affixed this qualification because the Centrists’acceptance of arising on the worldly seeming level is not what is to be negated.Moreover, if it were negated, its negation would be invalidated through whatCentrists accept, that is, arising on the level of seeming reality.” Candrakırti saysthat this is unfounded, because Centrists may talk about mere conventional aris-ing, but any arising from itselfis never accepted by Centrists even on the seem-ing level. He quotes from The Rice Seedling SÒtra, The SÒtra of Vast Display,955andThe Fundamental Verses956in order to show that both the Buddha and N›g›rjunarefuted arising from itself in general without the specification “ultimately.”Second, it might be argued, “The qualification ‘ultimately’ is affixed in relationto the system of the Enumerators because they assert that, ultimately, entities arisefrom themselves.” This is also unfounded, because the Enumerators’ presentationis not accepted by the Centrists even on the level of seeming reality. Candrakırtisays that since the non-Buddhists deviate from correctly seeing both levels of real-406The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 406"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"ity, it is all the better the more one refutes them in both these respects.The third and last try might be: “Ordinary worldly people say that things arisefrom themselves. Since this is not negated, the qualification ‘ultimately’ isused.”957It is not correct that ordinary people think or speak in terms of thingsarising from themselves. All they understand and say is that “results arise fromcauses,” without engaging in any analyses such as whether these results arise fromthemselves or from something other. This is also the way in which N›g›rjuna haspresented this. When worldly seeming conventions are used, the seeming is notexamined (such as analyzing from which level of reality things arise).In brief, the qualification “ultimately” is meaningless in all these respects.b) The fallacy if “ultimately” applies to the subjectIf Bh›vaviveka made this qualification out of the wish to negate the arising ofultimately existing subjects (such as the inner sources) on the level of seemingreality, then he ends up with either the fallacy called “a thesis with an unestab-lished basis” as the subject or the fallacy called “a reason with an unestablishedbasis,” because he himself as a Centrist does not accept these inner sources ulti-mately.It may be objected, “The first of these fallacies does not apply, since the innersources, such as the eyes, exist on the seeming level.” However, if “ultimately” isnot taken as qualifying the subject in question either, then what does it qualify?“Since it is negated that seeming phenomena, such as the eyes, arise ultimately,`ultimately’ qualifies the negation of arising.” In that case, Bh›vaviveka shouldhave said, “Ultimately, there is no arising of seemingphenomena, such as theeyes,” but no such thing was stated. And even if the subject had been stated as“seeming phenomena, such as the eyes,” it is still not suitable, because realistopponents such as the Enumerators claim that the eyes and so on are substantially(that is, ultimately) existent and not that they are imputedly (that is, seemingly)existent. Therefore, the fallacy called “a thesis with an unestablished basis fromthe perspective of the opponent” is incurred.In brief, if “ultimately existing eyes and such” are taken as the subject, it is notestablished for the Centrist. If “seemingly existing eyes and such” are taken, thesubject is not established for any realist opponent. In either case, the fallacy of athesis with an unestablished basis is incurred.2) There is no commonly appearing subject for Centrists and realistsAs a consequence of the above fallacies, someone like Bh›vaviveka might thendecide to simply drop all qualifications such as “ultimately” or “seemingly” andjust take some unqualified subject (such as eyes in general) that is common toboth parties. For him, in the inference that “sound is an impermanent phenom-enon,” mere generalities of sound and impermanent phenomena, but not par-The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 407Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 407"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"ticulars, are to be taken as the subject and the predicate. If particulars were taken,there would be no conventions in terms of inference and what is to be inferredin a debate between followers of different philosophical systems.To demonstrate this for the subject “sound,” if Buddhists take “sound thatderives from the four great elements” as the subject, it would not be establishedfor non-Buddhists such as the Differentiators.958And if the latter’s notion of“sound that is a quality of space” is taken, the subject would not be establishedfor Buddhists. Likewise, when people like the Differentiators or the Followers ofthe Great Exposition959hold the position that “sound is an impermanent phe-nomenon” and use “sound that is produced” as the subject, it cannot be estab-lished for the Analyzers, but if they use “sound that is manifest”960(as opposed tounmanifest), it cannot be established for themselves.As for the predicate, if the impermanence of sound is associated with a kindof perishing that needs an extra cause apart from sound, it would not be estab-lished for Buddhists (who say that sound does not need additional causes for itsperishing). If sound’s being impermanent is taken to be its uncaused perishing,it would not be established for opponents such as the Differentiators.Not surprisingly, Candrakırti answers that taking a mere general subject aswas just explained is unfounded too. In the context of an inference when thenegation of arising is asserted as the probandum, Bh›vaviveka himself acceptsthe failure, through a mere mistaken mind, to find any entity (such as mere eyes)that exists as the subject of this inference, since mistakenness and unmistakennessare different. This means that the objects of a mistaken, conventional mind thatevaluates the seeming (eyes and such) and the objects of the mind of a noble onethat evaluates the ultimate (freedom from discursiveness) are different. Hence, inthe context of a mistaken mind that takes as existent what does not exist—justas floating hairs are by those with blurred vision—how could even the slightestreally existent thing be observed? Conversely, from the perspective of an unmis-taken mind that does not superimpose anything unreal—just as floating hairs arenot perceived by those without blurred vision—how could even the slightestseemingly existing thing, such as eyes, be observed? Needless to say, ultimatelyexisting eyes and such are also not suitable to be taken as the subject, since theyare not established conventionally, nor through a reasoning consciousness, northrough the wisdom of the noble ones. Therefore, N›g›rjuna’s Rebuttal of Objec-tionssays:If there were anything to be observedThrough direct perception and the other instances [of valid cognition],It would be something to be established or rejected.However, since no such thing exists, I cannot be criticized.961408The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 408"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Since mistaken and unmistaken minds and their objects are different, in general,there exists nothing mistaken from the perspective of an unmistaken reasoningconsciousness that analyzes true reality. So how could there be any seeming eyesand such (as instances of what is mistaken) that serve as the subject in question?Consequently, neither the fallacy of a thesis with an unestablished basis nor thefallacy of a reason with an unestablished basis are removed by the unjustifiedsuggestion to use commonly appearing generalities as the subject in question.Despite all of these lucid words by Candrakırti, the Karmapa adds thatTsongkhapa and his heirs—who moreover see themselves as Candrakırti’s mainfollowers—still proclaim that “conventionally, entities that perform functionsare established through conventional valid cognition for Consequentialists.” Theyalso say that “in the Consequentialist system, the subject, such as a sprout, thatis taken as the basis for reasonings such as the freedom from unity and multi-plicity, is real inasmuch as such a sprout’s own performing of a function is estab-lished through conventional valid cognition. Therefore, this sprout is not thereally existent entity that is the object of negation by the valid cognition of a rea-soning consciousness. Rather, the object of negation that is to be negated by sucha reasoning consciousness is `real existence.’ This is the profound and secret ear-whispered pith instruction.” Conversely, they claim that others with wrong viewsand little merit, in particular the great early Consequentialists of Tibet, deprecatethe Consequentialists’ presentation of seeming reality.962However, the Karmapasays, these people are just like young fledgling owls whose eyes cannot bear theradiant, bright sunlight of Candrakırti. Moreover, the above example of a debate between two realists about general,unqualified sound is not comparable to a debate between Centrists and realists.In the example, a generality of sound and a generality of being impermanent(neither of which is asserted as being qualified in any way through particularphilosophical systems) are indeed established as what appears in common to theminds of the two realist debaters. However, when Centrists who speak of empti-ness debate with realists who speak about nonemptiness, the former do not accepteven on the level of the seeming that generalities of eyes and such are establishedin common, let alone being established ultimately. Thus, there is no commonlyappearing subject for the Centrist Bh›vaviveka and realists (ultimately existingeyes and such are not established for the former, while seemingly existing eyes arenot established for the latter). Hence, the above way of exposing the fallacy of athesis with an unestablished basis applies equally to exposing the fallacy that thebasis of the reason “because they exist already” in Bh›vaviveka’s original proba-tive argument is unestablished.In summary, the Karmapa says, what Bh›vaviveka takes as the basis of debateare seeming eyes as something merely seeming by way of seeming valid cognition.The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 409Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 409"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"According to Candrakırti, this is contradictory to both valid cognition and whatis accepted by all Centrists including Bh›vaviveka himself. If the seeming existedas entities that perform functions on the seeming level, this contradicts everyCentrist’s acceptance that all phenomena (that is, all entities that perform a func-tion) are empty of their own respective natures. On the other hand, if it isasserted that there is an entity that is not established as a particular instance ofeither of the two realities while being established as its mere generality, then suchan entity is excluded from the set of knowable objects through the perceptualvalid cognitions and the common consensus of all ordinary beings and nobleones as well as through the detailed scriptural authority of the Buddha’s words.This represents the essential dividing line between Autonomists and Conse-quentialists.Relating This Critique to What Bh›vaviveka Himself Accepts963What was explained in this way—that the subject and the reason are not estab-lished on either level of the two realities and do not appear in common to bothparties—is in fact accepted by Bh›vaviveka himself. In his Lamp of Knowledge, aBuddhist opponent (a hearer) states the following probative argument:There definitely are causes that produce the inner sources, because theThus-Gone One said so. What the Thus-Gone teaches in a certainway is just so, for example, [his statement that] “nirv› ̊a is peace.”In this probative argument, Bh›vaviveka exposes the following fallacy:What do you assert is the meaning of the reason here? Do you mean“because the Thus-Gone One said so in terms of the seeming” or“because he said so in terms of the ultimate”? If it refers to the seem-ing, the meaning of the reason is not established for yourself [becauseyou claim that the Buddha asserts the inner sources ultimately]. How-ever, if it refers to the ultimate [consider The Fundamental Verses]:When no phenomenon that is existent,Nonexistent, or [both] existent and nonexistent is produced . . .964This refers to the elimination of any conditions that produce a resultthat has the nature of being either existent, nonexistent, or both exis-tent and nonexistent. Therefore [the verse continues]:This being so, how is it feasibleFor a cause to be a producer?410The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 410"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"The meaning of this statement [by N›g›rjuna] is that what [ulti-mately exists] is definitely not a cause that produces something.Hence, since ultimately something produced and a producer are notestablished, your reason is either not established in meaning [whenreferring to the ultimate] or contradictory in meaning [when referringto the seeming].965Through this examination in terms of the two realities, Bh›vaviveka has exposedthe fallacy of the reason being neither established for the hearers themselves norfor Centrists like him.The gist of this is as follows. For the assumed existence of causes for the innersources, the hearers give as a reason only “because the Thus-Gone One said so.”However, according to Bh›vaviveka, in terms of either of the two realities, thereis nothing to be stated as a reason that says only that much (that is, a reason thatis unqualified in terms of referring to the seeming or the ultimate level). Likewise,Candrakırti says that Bh›vaviveka tries to state a subject that is only “the innersources” and a reason that is only “because they exist already.” However, again,in terms of either of the two realities, there is nothing to be stated as such anunqualified subject or reason. Consequently, it is highly self-contradictory forBh›vaviveka to state such subjects and reasons, saying that a seeming subject anda reason that are established through seeming valid cognition on the seeminglevel exist as something that appears in common for both parties. Just asBh›vaviveka himself tells the hearers that the scriptures in which the Buddhaspoke of the existence of the inner sources are not commonly established for himand them, Candrakırti denies Bh›vaviveka’s claim that his subject and reasonexist as something commonly established for both him and his realist opponents.How then is it to be understood that Consequentialists themselves pronouncesubjects such as “the inner sources” and reasons such as “because they existalready” as parts of their statements from the perspective of the Enumerators,doing so for the sake of relinquishing the latter’s superimpositions and denialswith regard to true reality? Do Centrists pronounce such subjects and reasons bytaking them as generalities without differentiating them in terms of the two real-ities or as particulars by differentiating them in this way? The answer is not toohard to guess. Of course, Consequentialists do not pronounce subjects and rea-sons in either of these ways, because they pronounce the parts of their statementsby strictly following the dance steps in the unquestioned choreography of debateas it is acknowledged by others. The Karmapa compares this to the followingexample. When a human person meets a person that is just a magical creation andwhen the human person, through acting in certain ways, makes the magicallycreated person cut off her own head with her own weapon, then the head of thismagically created person was obviously not cut off by any weapon of the humanThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 411Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 411"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"412The Center of the Sunlit Skyperson at all, much less was such a weapon a general weapon that is not differen-tiated in terms of the two realities or a particular weapon that is so differentiated.Candrakırti continues that, since Bh›vaviveka himself has accepted the non-establishment of the reason through his critique of the hearers’ above probativeargument, the same fallacy applies to all of Bh›vaviveka’s own probative argu-ments as well. In all inferences in which he states reasons or subjects that aretreated as real entities, it is precisely on his own account that such reasons andsubjects are neither established for himself (ultimately) nor for his realist oppo-nents (as mere seeming entities). Since his reasons are thus not reasons that areestablished as commonly appearing to both debaters, what is to be proven—pro-found true reality—and all means of proof collapse.Take the following examples of probative arguments in Bh›vaviveka’s Lampof Knowledge:Ultimately, the inner sources do not arise from their conditions thatare other [than them] because of being other, just as a vase.The producers of the inner sources such as the eyes—which othersintend to express as ultimately [existent]—are ascertained as not beingconditions because of being other [than the inner sources], just asyarn.966In these probative arguments, the reason “being other” and so on are (ultimately)not established for Bh›vaviveka himself.In another case, an opponent says:Inner entities [that is, the sources such as the eyes] are definitely arisen,because specific conventional expressions for the [persons] whose[appearance] involves the objects [visual form and so on] of these[sources] are used [such as “people sit” or “they go”].Wanting to expose the nonestablishment of the above reason stated by the oppo-nent, Bh›vaviveka says:[If your reason refers to the level of seeming reality, it is not estab-lished for yourself as a realist.] If, ultimately, arising, going, and so onwere established as existent for a yogin in meditative equipoise who,through the eye of supreme knowledge, sees the real nature of entitiesjust as it is, then the [above] reason—”because specific conventionalexpressions for the [persons] whose [appearance] involves the objects[visual form and so on] of these [sources] are used [such as `people sit’Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 412"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"or `they go’]”—is unestablished in meaning, because going is likewisenegated through precisely the negation of arising [in The Fundamen-tal Versesthat precedes it].967On account of just this analytical approach, the same is to be applied toBh›vaviveka’s own probative arguments:Ultimately, what is not yet gone over is not being gone over [rightnow] because of being a [not-gone-over] path, just like the path alreadygone over.968Here, the reason “being a [not-gone-over] path” is ultimately not established forBh›vaviveka himself.The same applies to the following probative arguments in Bh›vaviveka’s Lampof Knowledge:Ultimately, an eye that is operative [as the medium of a visual con-sciousness] does not see forms because of being an eye sense faculty,just like an inoperative [eye sense faculty when asleep].969and his Heart of Centrism:The eye does not see form, because it derives from the elements, justas its own form.970Earth is not hard in nature, because it is an element, just as wind.971Also, in Bh›vaviveka’s original probative argument, the reason is uncertain:It is certain that, ultimately, the inner sources do not arise from them-selves, because they exist [already]—just as an existent consciousness.The reason is uncertain because the entailment of the predicate by the reason isdubitable for his opponents, the Enumerators. For they might wonder, “Is it thatthe inner sources do not arise from themselves because they exist already, just asconsciousness exists, or is it that they do arise from themselves, just like vasesand such?”Bh›vaviveka might say, “Although it is not explicitly stated as the probandumthat vases and such do not arise from themselves, they are equally—that is,implicitly—established as not arising from themselves, because they exist already.Hence, there is no uncertainty of the reason.” However, this is not so, becauseThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 413Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 413"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"Bh›vaviveka stated only the inner sources as the subject, but not any outersources, such as vases.In brief, all these fallacies are not incurred by Bh›vaviveka merely because heemploys such reasonings (we saw that N›g›rjuna and Candrakırti do as well), butbecause he takes them to be probative arguments whose elements (the subject andso on) as well as the relationships between these elements (the three modes) areestablished as appearing similarly to both parties.Showing That Candrakırti Incurs No Flaws of Internal Contradiction972Bh›vaviveka and others might object here, “The very fallacies that Candrakırtiascribes to Bh›vaviveka’s inferences equally apply to his own inferences. Theseequally must obtain the fallacies of an unestablished basis and an unestablishedreason and so on. Thus, what represents a fallacy for both Candrakırti andBh›vaviveka should not be used as an objection against just one of them, whichmeans that all these fallacies adduced against Bh›vaviveka are unfounded.”Candrakırti answers that these flaws of the subject and the reason not beingcommonly established through valid cognition apply only to those who employautonomous inferences in which the subject property and the entailment arecommonly established through valid cognition, but not to Consequentialists likehimself. If Consequentialists do not formulate inferences that are establishedthrough valid cognition in their own system, they would not even in their dreamsformulate any autonomous inferences that are established through valid cogni-tion in common with anybody else’s system, since the inferences of Consequen-tialists have the effect of merely negating the positions of others. This means thatthese inferences are invalidating consequences that cut through all kinds of super-impositions and denials in the minds of others, while the minds of true Centrists,when pronouncing such statements, remain throughout free from all discursive-ness of wishing to express anything that is to be understood or causes under-standing.How then do Consequentialists pronounce such inferences that are conse-quences to invalidate the positions of others? For example, some people, such asthe hearers, think that the eye sees what is other than itself, even though it doesnot see itself. They can be refuted through inferences that are acknowledged bythemselves. For, on the one hand, they assert that the eye has the property of notseeing itself (thus accepting the subject property in the Consequentialists’ con-sequence to come). On the other hand (as for the eye being able to see at all), theystill accept its necessary concomitance with the property of seeing somethingother, such as the color blue. However, based on their own examples such as avase, they at the same time accept the necessary concomitance that somethingcannot see something else without seeing itself (thus accepting the entailment of414The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 414"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"the predicate by the reason in the Consequentialists’ consequence to come).Hence, by formulating the three modes as accepted in this way, Candrakırti’sconsequence to invalidate the positions of these opponents runs as follows:Wherever there is no seeing of itself, there is no seeing of somethingother, just as in the case of a vase. For the eye, there is no seeing ofitself. Therefore, there is no seeing of something other for it either.973Therefore, the eye’s seeing of something other (such as the color blue), whichis in fact contradictory to not seeing itself, is contradicted by an inference inwhich the subject property and the entailment are acknowledged by the oppo-nents themselves. In this way, the wrong ideas of the opponents are eliminatedthrough the use of an inference that is established for these very opponents. Sinceit is only such a negation of a thesis of others that is pointed out through infer-ences pronounced by Consequentialists, how could their position be affected bythe fallacies mentioned above, so that they would incur the same flaws?Bh›vaviveka and others may question this, asking, “Is there any invalidationthrough inference even by way of an inference that is acknowledged by only oneof the two parties in debate?” There is, but only through a reason that is acknowl-edged by the very person whose position is invalidated, not through a reason thatis acknowledged by the other debater, because such is seen as being practiced inthe world. In the world, sometimes victory or defeat comes about through thewords of a referee whom both parties take to be authoritative, and sometimes itcomes about only through one’s own words. However, neither victory nor defeatcomes about through the words of the other party alone. This means that if wespeak the truth without any contradictions, then such a statement neither turnsinto defeat through someone else saying that it is wrong nor becomes true (oreven more true) by another approving of it. Likewise, if our own words are wrong,we just defeat ourselves. It is not that our words or thoughts are made wrong byanother person. In general, we are convinced by what is established for ourselvesand not merely by the fact that certain reasons are established for others. In otherwords, other people may help us through their words to see for ourselves that weare wrong, but the actual understanding of this can only happen in our ownminds through our own insights.Others might still object, “This is how it is in the world, but not in the situa-tion of stating logical reasonings.” For example, Vasubandhu says:Since [in debate] one has the desire to refute what is acknowledged byothers, an[other’s] inference cannot be invalidated through the forceof what is acknowledged by others.974The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 415Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 415"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"Dign›ga’s Gate to Reasoningconsiders:That which states what is certain for both [parties] may serve as eitherproof or invalidation, but not a statement that is acknowledged by[only] one of the two or about which there is doubt.975In other words, these two say that victory and defeat come about through adebate in which both parties accept the three modes, whereas this does nothappen if one debater accepts the modes and the other does not. However, justas it is in the world, so it is also for logicians, because in the treatises on reason-ing, nothing but worldly conventions are relevant for the decisions as to what issuitable or not. Hence, by following the world’s conventions as to what is suit-able and what is not, also the above people should accept the aforesaid procedurewith regard to inference: that it is sufficient for consequences and such to beestablished for others, even if they are not established for those who pronouncethem.In the same vein, Buddhist invalidation of non-Buddhist positions throughscripture is generally not accomplished by way of scriptures that are acknowl-edged by both parties, since non-Buddhist scriptures are obviously not acknowl-edged by both Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Rather, the invalidation of theassertions of non-Buddhists is accomplished by means of their own scripturesthat are acknowledged only by themselves (that is, by exposing their internalcontradictions). Likewise, when Centrists and Buddhist realists debate, thoseBuddhist scriptures in which entities are described as being established areregarded by Centrists as being of expedient meaning and by realists as being ofdefinitive meaning. Therefore, they are not equally acknowledged by both. Nev-ertheless, it is not the case that Centrists, in the context of refuting certain fea-tures of the assertions of Buddhist realists, do not put forward such Buddhistscriptures (in which entities are described as being established) as an invalida-tion for these realists.In the case of inference for oneself (for example, in analytical meditation), itis obvious that what is acknowledged by oneself naturally prevails in all cases andnot what is acknowledged by both oneself and someone else. For example, whena person infers the existence of fire behind a hill, it is because this person herselfsees the related smoke and then makes the connection to the fire. This person’srealization of the existence of fire because of seeing smoke is not at all affected bythe fact that a blind person in her company cannot see the smoke and thus doesnot realize the existence of fire.In summary, in contrast to the approach of Bh›vaviveka and others, it isunnecessary to state defining characteristics in terms of rational logic as to themodes of a reason being commonly established. For, although the Buddhas them-416The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 416"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"selves do not cling to such notions as purity and impurity or truth and untruth,they assist the beings who are to be trained and ignorant about true reality withjustifications of purity and impurity or truth and untruth just as these areacknowledged by those attached beings themselves. Likewise, the noble ones arecompletely free from any words, thoughts, and expressions of existence, nonex-istence, both, or neither with respect to arising from the four extremes. Never-theless, for the sake of opponents who conceive of any kind of arising in termsof the four extremes, they negate such arising by relying on the functions of validcognition as these are established through the opponents’ own valid cognition.As firyadeva’sFour Hundred Versesstates:Just as barbarians cannot understandThrough any other language [than their own],So the world cannot understandExcept through the worldly.976Perhaps a more inviting way of saying this is that ordinary language and con-ventions serve as the receptacles for the nectar of wisdom.Finally, Candrakırti ends this little excursion in the first chapter of his LucidWordsby exclaiming, “Enough of all this ancillary discursiveness now!”To conclude, it should be noted that Candrakırti’s entire critique ofBh›vaviveka solely pertains to the understanding and the use of reasoning inCentrism. Candrakırti clearly considers Bh›vaviveka a Centrist and does notquestion his understanding of the contents of Centrism per se. This is also high-lighted in the colophon of The Lucid Words:In order to delight those who have great intelligence, I taught [here]by putting together the good explanations by Bh›vaviveka upon [his]having seen the commentary composed by Buddhap›lita (the former[commentary] thus coming about via the latter) as well as what I foundthrough thorough discrimination myself.977Thus, unlike what Tsongkhapa and others superimpose, Candrakırti does notattack Bh›vaviveka for his insufficient realization of emptiness, his too-narrowobject of negation, his assertion of conventional phenomena existing by virtue oftheir own specific characteristics, or the like, but just for his approach to reason-ing in order to make others too realize the selfsame emptiness.The following briefly shows how Tsongkhapa reinterpreted Candrakırti’s cri-tique outlined above. In general, Tsongkhapa and his followers vehemently denythat Centrists have no thesis, that they do not have their own system, and thatnothing is established through valid cognition, despite the fact that Candrakırti—The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 417Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 417"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"418The Center of the Sunlit Skywhom they claim to strictly follow—explicitly and repeatedly said so. Tsong -khapa reinterprets autonomous reasoning in general as an inference that presup-poses the acceptance of phenomena being (conventionally or ultimately)established through their own specific characteristics by valid cognition. In par-ticular, Bh›vaviveka is taken as an Autonomist who conventionally employs pre-cisely this kind of autonomous reasoning. In contrast to Candrakırti then,Tsongkhapa criticizes Bh›vaviveka not for his use of autonomous reasoning perse—he rather sees it as legitimate within his assumed Autonomist ontology—butmore for the latter’s ontology of specifically characterized phenomena. However,as was made clear in detail above, Tsongkhapa grounds his critique entirely onhis own baseless definition of an Autonomist ontology of specifically character-ized phenomena that does not exist in Autonomist texts. It is solely Tsongkhapaand not Candrakırti who brings up the Autonomists’ supposed acceptance ofphenomena as being conventionally established through their own specific char-acteristics. In other words, Tsongkhapa criticizes Bh›vaviveka for positions thatTsongkhapa himself has superimposed on him.978Yoshimizu gives a very clear outline of how Tsongkhapa has made substantialshifts from Candrakırti’s original critique of Bh›vaviveka.979Having objected tothe kind of autonomous reasoning that is based on specifically characterized phe-nomena, Tsongkhapa goes a step further and, in his own version of Consequen-tialism, sanctions the use of inferential proof (in addition to just formulatingabsurd consequences) as well as the two kinds of valid cognition proposed byDign›ga and Dharmakırti (perception and inference). Thus, he claims that Can-drakırti only rejected the kind of autonomous reasoning that involves phenom-ena established through their own specific characteristics. We have seen, however,that Candrakırti rejects the use of autonomous reasoning, because Centrists donot have any thesis of their own. Tsonkhapa’s first major shift is to take Bh›vaviveka not only as the propo-nent of the inferential proof of nonarising but also as the opponent to be refutedby the Consequentialists. In this way, it is the Consequentialist who becomesthe proponent of an inferential statement instead of the Autonomist Bh›vaviveka,who is regarded as “someone who states that a nature exists” (Tib. rang bzhin yodpar smra ba). In this context, Tsongkhapa also modifies Candrakırti’s explana-tions of what it means for the subject in question to be established as somethingthat appears in common for both opponent and proponent by taking this to bethe similarity of the valid cognition that establishes the elements of an inference.In brief, there are two criteria for Candrakırti as to the common establishmentof the subject in question:A)The main criterion is the ontological issue of whether this subject exists in anultimate or a conventional sense.Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 418"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"B) The objects of unmistaken (Tib. phyin ci ma log pa) cognition belong to theultimate, and the objects of mistaken (Tib. phyin ci log pa) cognition belongto the seeming.Tsongkhapa differs: A)The main criterion is the ontological question of whether the subject exists asbeing established through its own specific characteristics.B)The object of nonerroneous (Tib. ma ‘khrul pa) valid cognition is what isestablished through its own specific characteristics (ultimately or convention-ally), and the object of an erroneous (Tib. ‘khrul pa) cognition is what is notso established.Thus, Tsongkhapa has substituted his own criterion for common establishmentbased on the appearance of real specific characteristics for the criterion of Can-drakırti, which is based on the distinction between what is ultimate and what isseeming. This is also reflected in his shift from Candrakırti’s terms “mis-taken/unmistaken” by tacitly equating them with “erroneous/nonerroneous.”980Tsongkhapa’s second major shift concerns why Consequentialists do not pro-pound autonomous inferences. Candrakırti’s idea of autonomous inference asindicated in his Lucid Wordsis as follows:1) Autonomous inference is a proof based on a thesis or position of one’s own, asopposed to a reasoning employed solely in order to negate any thesis of others.2) Or, it is a proof based on what is established for oneself, that is, based on a sub-ject in question and its properties that are established for the proponent inde-pendently of others. This contrasts with a reasoning based on a subject and itsproperties that are established solely for others.Accordingly, by giving two reasons, Candrakırti explains why Centrists do notpropound autonomous inferences: 1) Centrists do not have any thesis or position of their own, nor do they have anyvalid cognition to prove such a thesis.2) There is nothing to be established for Centrists themselves through valid cog-nition.981In contrast, as listed by Yoshimizu, Tsongkhapa’s theory of Autonomistsemploying autonomous reasoning on the basis of phenomena established throughtheir own specific characteristics can be summarized as follows:The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 419Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 419"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"a) Autonomists conventionally accept phenomena established through their ownspecific characteristics.b) Therefore, they accept unmistaken valid cognitions that establish such phe-nomena via their specific characteristics.c) Therefore, they share with their realist opponents not only a common appear-ance of valid cognition but also of the subject, reason, and example in theirinferential statements.d) Therefore, they can properly make use of autonomous inferences.Correspondingly, Tsongkhapa’s reasons for explaining the Consequentialists’rejection of autonomous reasoning are the following:a) Consequentialists do not even conventionally accept phenomena establishedthrough their own specific characteristics.b) Therefore, they do not accept any unmistaken valid cognitions that establishsuch phenomena.c) Therefore, they share with their realist opponents (including the Autonomists)neither a common appearance of valid cognitions nor of subject, reason, andexample in their inferential statements.d) Therefore, they do not propound an autonomous inference.Thus, through ontological and epistemological modifications that are all basedon his initial claim that Autonomists conventionally assert phenomena estab-lished through their own specific characteristics, Tsongkhapa outrightly deniesCandrakırti’s answer (1) and significantly revises answer (2) to the question aboveas to why Consequentialists do not propound autonomous inferences. To sum up, Tsongkhapa’s main points in his reinterpretation of Candrakırti’s cri-tique of autonomous inference are as follows:1) Autonomous inference is a proof in which its elements are established throughtheir own specific characteristics by valid cognition either ultimately or con-ventionally for the proponents themselves.2) Common establishment means that these elements of an inference are com-monly established through their own specific characteristics by valid cognitionfor both proponent and opponent.3) Autonomists, such as Bh›vaviveka, can properly propound such autonomousinferences to their realist opponents precisely because they conventionallyaccept phenomena established through their own specific characteristics andthus fulfill the condition for common establishment as in (B) above.4) In his Lucid Words, Candrakırti criticizes Bh›vaviveka not only as the propo-420The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 420"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"nent of an inferential statement but also as one of the realist opponents to berefuted by Consequentialists.5) Candrakırti criticizes autonomous inference, because he neither ultimately norconventionally accepts phenomena as being established through their ownspecific characteristics, but not because he thinks that Centrists have no the-sis of their own.With all of these reinterpretations, however, Candrakırti’s arguments againstBh›vaviveka and the radical critique of valid cognition and probative reasoninglose their point. According to Candrakırti, the main reason that Bh›vaviveka’sautonomous inferences are wrong is that each of their subjects is neither ulti-mately existent nor established for Bh›vaviveka himself (since, as a Centrist, hemust deny any intrinsic, real existence) nor as something on the mere seeminglevel for his realist opponents.T Do Hearers and Solitary Realizers Realize Emptiness?As mentioned earlier, apart from the purely methodological issues in terms of rea-soning, Bh›vaviveka on the one side and Buddhap›lita and Candrakırti on theother also disagreed on a more substantial issue. This revolves around two relatedquestions: (1) whether emptiness is taught in the sÒtras of the hearers and (2)whether they and the solitary realizers realize both kinds of identitylessness (per-sonal and phenomenal).Buddhap›lita’s PositionThis controversy is based on the commentaries of these masters on N›g›rjuna’sFundamental VersesVII.34:Like a dream, like an illusion,And like a city of scent-eaters,Thus, arising, abiding,And also ceasing are said to be.Buddhap›lita does not explicitly address the above two questions but commentsthat examples such as an illusion, an echo, a reflection, a mirage, a dream, a ballof foam, a bubble, and a banana tree in general illustrate the identitylessness ofall conditioned phenomena (thus also alluding to Sa ̇yutta Nik›yaIII.141-2The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 421Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 421"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"quoted just below). He says that “All phenomena are identityless” and that “iden-titylessness” (nair›tmya) refers to the lack of nature (ni ̄svabh›va), because theterm “identity” (›tman) is a word for “nature” (svabh›va).982Bh›vaviveka’s PositionBh›vaviveka denies that emptiness is taught in the sÒtras of the hearers as well asthat hearers and solitary realizers realize both kinds of identitylessness.As for the first question, when commenting on the above verse by N›g›rjunain his Lamp of Knowledge,983Bh›vaviveka makes a distinction as to whether theexamples for identitylessness appear in the sÒtras of the lesser or the great vehi-cle. He says that the Buddha gave the following verse as a remedy for only theafflictive obscurations, because a nature of a self and what is mine does not exist,although it seems to.Form is like a ball of foam.Feelings resemble bubbles.Discrimination is like a mirage.Formations are equal to a banana tree.Consciousness is like an illusion.Thus spoke the one who sees true reality.984On the other hand, in the great vehicle, conditioned phenomena are consti-tuted by their lack of nature, although they appear as if they had a nature. There-fore, such statements as in the concluding verse from The Diamond Cutter SÒtraare given as a remedy for both the afflictive and the cognitive obscurations:Like stars, blurred vision, lamps,Illusions, dew, bubbles,Dreams, lightning, and clouds,Thus, conditioned phenomena are to be viewed.In general, the five aggregates (in the first quote) and conditioned phenomena(in the second) are equivalent, so for Bh›vaviveka the difference obviously lies notin these statements themselves but rather in whom they address. He criticizesBuddhap›lita’s comment that all these examples refer to phenomenal identity-lessness by saying that “identitylessness” in the vehicle of the hearers specificallyrefers to “personal identitylessness.” Hence, the term cannot demonstrate phe-nomenal identitylessness. If it could, it would be pointless to take up another (thatis, the great) vehicle.985As for the second question, when commenting on Fundamental VersesXVIII.4–5,986Bh›vaviveka says that the liberation of hearers and solitary realizers422The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 422"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"means only the removal of the afflictive obscurations through realizing personalidentitylessness. Bodhisattvas relinquish both obscurations and realize both typesof identitylessness, thus achieving Buddhahood.The relation of the two obscurations to the realization of the two kinds of iden-titylessness is addressed in more detail in Bh›vaviveka’sBlaze of Reasoning.987Hesays that afflictive obscurations are twofold: those that have the nature of bindingand those that are latent tendencies. Cognitive obscurations only have the natureof binding. From among these, hearers and solitary realizers relinquish merelythe binding afflictive obscurations, but not their latent tendencies or the cogni-tive obscurations. Therefore, it cannot be said that arhats pass into nirv› ̊a, sincethey still have obscurations, just like stream-enterers.988 Ignorance is of two types:afflicted and unafflicted. The first shows in being attached to and proud of one’sself and so on, whereas the latter has the nature of latent tendencies. From amongthese two, arhats fully relinquish afflicted ignorance, since they realize personalidentitylessness. They still have unafflicted ignorance, which does not, however,obscure their mere liberation from cyclic existence. Thus, despite the presence ofsuch unafflicted ignorance, it is said that “they attained the knowledge of termi-nation and nonarising.”989As for the latent tendencies of the afflictions, unaf-flicted ignorance, and the cognitive obscurations, all these can only be relinquishedthrough meditation on emptiness on the special path of the great vehicle.KamalaŸıla’s PositionKamalaŸıla’s Stages of Meditationquotes The SÒtra of the Ten Grounds:O son of good family, this is the true nature of phenomena. No mat-ter whether the Thus-Gone Ones appear or not, this expanse of dhar-mas just abides. Thus, all phenomena are emptiness, and allphenomena are unobservable. This is not just a characterization lim-ited to the Thus-Gone Ones, but all hearers and solitary realizers tooattain this nonconceptual nature of phenomena.990and The SÒtra of the King of Meditative Concentration:To discern phenomenal identitylessnessAnd meditate on what has been discerned Is the cause that results in the attainment of nirv› ̊a.Other causes will not bring about [this] peace.991KamalaŸıla identifies the root or cause of the afflictions as the mistaken reifi-cation of phenomena that actually are unarisen and unceasing (that is, the cling-ing to real entities despite there being none). He supports this by several quotesThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 423Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 423"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"from The SÒtra That Teaches Seeming and Ultimate Reality.992His Commentary onThe Ornament of Centrismagrees that all afflictions are solely triggered by thismistaken reification, which shows in wrongly focusing on what lacks a nature.Thus, such mistakenness can only be relinquished through its opposite, the real-ization of the lack of nature.993The Stages of Meditationadds that it is only whenmistaken reification has been eliminated that both afflictive and cognitive obscu-rations are fully relinquished. Thus, on the path of hearers and solitary realizers,the two obscurations are not properly relinquished, since the entirety of suchmistakenness is not eliminated.994Despite KamalaŸıla’s quote from The SÒtra ofthe Ten Groundsabove (and in contrast to Candrakırti), he seems to conclude thathearers and solitary realizers do not realize phenomenal identitylessness and thusare not really liberated, since he next adduces The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºkasaying that the hearers’ liberation is limited in this way:Others, by seeing that all phenomena depend on causes, come to acertain realization that they consider “nirv› ̊a.” However, since theydo not see phenomenal identitylessness, Mah›mati, they do not pos-sess liberation. Mah›mati, those who have the disposition for the clearrealization of the vehicle of hearers develop a mental state of beingreleased within nonrelease.Thus, since there is no liberation through other paths, the Buddha has said thatthere is only a single vehicle. The paths of hearers and so on are comparable toone child protecting another and are only taught with the intention of intro-ducing them into the great vehicle. Hence, by meditating that the mere aggre-gates exist but without a self existing in them, the hearers engage in personalidentitylessness. Meditation on phenomenal identitylessness starts with the levelof meditating that all appearances are mere mind and culminates in realizing thatmind too is identityless.995Similar to Bh›vaviveka, KamalaŸıla understands per-sonal identitylessness as the aggregates being without a self and “mine.” Phe-nomenal identitylessness means that these very aggregates are illusionlike.996Candrakırti’s PositionBh›vaviveka’s denial that the sÒtras of the lesser vehicle teach emptiness and thathearers and solitary realizers realize both kinds of identitylessness hinges on threemain points: the different meanings of “identity” and “identitylessness” in thesÒtras of the lesser and the great vehicle, the way of distinguishing the two obscu-rations, and what distinguishes the great vehicle from the lesser. Candrakırti crit-icizes him on all three points.First, unlike Bh›vaviveka, Candrakırti does not distinguish between personalidentitylessness and phenomenal identitylessness in terms of subtlety. Rather, he424The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 424"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"understands identitylessness in the general sense of the absence of an intrinsicnature in any given referent, be it the person or any other phenomenon. As hiscommentary on firyadeva’s Four Hundred Versessays:“Identity” refers to a nature or essence of entities that does not dependon anything other. The nonexistence of this is identitylessness.Through classifying it in terms of phenomena and persons, it isunderstood as twofold: “phenomenal identitylessness” and “personalidentitylessness.”997All that Candrakırti says in his Lucid Words(commenting on FundamentalVersesXVIII.4–5) is that Bh›vaviveka has not understood that hearers and soli-tary realizers possess the realization of emptiness. As a support, he quotes ThePrajñ›p›ramit› SÒtra in Eight Thousand Lines, which says that also those whowant to train in the grounds of hearers and solitary realizers should train in theperfection of knowledge by listening, reading, and meditating.998Candrakırticoncludes by saying that Bh›vaviveka obviously does not follow N›g›rjuna in thispoint and refers to his own detailed treatment of the issue in his autocommen-tary onThe Entrance into Centrism.999The Entrance into Centrismitself says:Even those [bodhisattvas] who abide on the first [ground through their]view of the perfect mind of enlightenmentPrevail over [hearers] born from the speech of the Sage and solitary realizersThrough the force of their merit and will increase [it further].On [the ground] “Gone Afar,” also their insight will be superior.1000By following Candrakırti’s commentary, the Eighth Karmapa elaborates on theissues at hand.1001Bodhisattvas on the first ground surpass hearers and solitaryrealizers through their development of the mind of enlightenment on the level ofthe seeming (that is, all the merit they have accumulated out of the wish to attainBuddhahood for the sake of all beings). Bodhisattvas on the seventh ground aresuperior in terms of both this and their realization of the ultimate mind of enlight-enment (insight into emptiness). They do not even cling to any characteristics, letalone to any real existence of things, be it in terms of the scriptures or the expanseof dharmas itself. This process of becoming superior in all respects is usually illus-trated by a classic example from the sÒtras (such as in The SÒtra of the Ten Groundsand The Liberating Life Example of Maitreya). A newborn prince is already supe-rior to all the king’s ministers inasmuch as he is born into a royal family. How-ever, in terms of his own mental power while still a child, he is not. Finally, whenhe has grown up and received the best possible education, he surpasses the king’sThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 425Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 425"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"ministers in all respects. Likewise, once bodhisattvas have truly generated themind of enlightenment, they are superior to hearers and solitary realizers in termsof their motivation but not their mental power. On the seventh ground, by theirgreat insight, they surpass hearers and solitary realizers in all respects.Candrakırti says that this passage in the sÒtras shows that hearers and solitaryrealizers possess the realization of phenomenal identitylessness. He supports thisby adducing (1) three reasonings and (2) seven further quotations.10021) The three reasonings are stated in the form of absurd consequences that fol-low if hearers and solitary realizers did not posses such realization.a) It follows that hearers and solitary realizers as the subject can be outshone interms of mental power even by bodhisattvas on the first ground, because hearersand solitary realizers do not realize that entities are without nature, just likeworldly people free from attachment.1003The reason is accepted and its entailmentof the predicate is established. But if this consequence is accepted, it contradictsthe quote from The SÒtra of the Ten Grounds.b) It follows that hearers and solitary realizers as the subject have not relinquishedall afflictions of the three realms, because, by mistakenly focusing on form andsuch as being really established by their own nature, their thus mistaken mindsbecome afflicted, just like worldly people free from attachment.c) It follows that hearers and solitary realizers who cling to the aggregates as enti-ties that are impermanent, without a self, and so on as the subject do not even real-ize personal identitylessness, because they possess the view of focusing on theaggregates, which is the cause for imputing a self. For example, if the clinging tothe reality of the individual parts of a chariot is not put to an end, the clinging tothe reality of the chariot that is composed of these parts is not put to an end either.In this consequence, the subject property is accepted. The entailment of thepredicate by the reason is established as follows: Through viewing the aggregatesas substances that are impermanent, suffering, without a self, and so on, one isunable to eradicate either the clinging to a self with regard to such aggregates orthe afflictions (such as desire and hatred) that result from such clinging, since thecause of self-clinging and afflictions—the reifying clinging to entities—has notbeen undermined at all. Whether the aggregates are regarded as substantial enti-ties that are impermanent or permanent, with or without a self, all such views areequal in being mistaken with regard to emptiness as the true nature of phenom-ena. Hence, they cannot serve as remedies for reification, just as aversion to uglyobjects cannot fundamentally eradicate the attachment that holds objects to bebeautiful. The Fundamental Versessays:426The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 426"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"If clinging to what is impermanentAs being permanent is wrong,How could clinging to emptinessAs being impermanent not be wrong?1004This is the meaning of the teaching that, without realizing precisely the equal-ity of all phenomena, nirv› ̊a is not attained through a comparatively limitedrealization of the four realities of the noble ones. AsThe Large Prajñ›p›ramit›SÒtrasays:One will not completely pass into nirv› ̊a through understanding suf-fering and also not through suffering [itself]. One will not completelypass into nirv› ̊a through understanding the origin of suffering andalso not through the origin of suffering [itself].

One will not completely pass into nirv› ̊athrough understanding the path and also not through the path [itself].I teach that such equality of these four realities of the noble ones iscomplete purity: equality is suchness.Some people think, “Through regarding the aggregates as impermanent andso on, the clinging to a self that is permanent, single, and independent is put toan end. Therefore, all afflictions will be relinquished.” This is not the case.Through merely realizing that there is no permanent, single, and independent selfthat is something other than the aggregates, neither the clinging to a self whosecause lies in its imputation onto these aggregates themselves nor the resultingafflictions can be put to an end. The notion of a permanent, single, and inde-pendent self is not the basis that serves as the object of the innate clinging to“me.” Moreover, it can be seen that even those who do not have any clinging tosuch a notion of a self still possess the clinging to “me” and afflictions. This isexpressed in The Entrance into Centrism:The yogins of your [tradition]who see the lack of a self [that is permanent and so on]Do not realize the true reality of form and so on.Since desire and such operate by focusing on form,They will still arise, because the nature of the [aggregates] is not realized.When you realize the lack of a self, you relinquish a permanent self,Which is not asserted as the basis for the [innate] clinging to “me.”The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 427Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 427"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Therefore, it is amazing to say that the [innate] views about a selfAre eradicated through understanding the lack of a [permanent] self.That while seeing a snake that lives in a hole in the wall of your houseYour concerns [could be] eliminated [by saying], “There is no elephanthere,”And thus also your fear of the snake be relinquished,Oh, my, this is nothing but a laugh for others.1005In other words, the clinging to (a) the imputed notion of a permanent, single,and independent self is gross and obvious like an elephant. However, it is just acoarser, additional layer on the more deeply ingrained and “sneaky,” snakelikeinnate clinging to (b) the notion of “me” (which is the root of afflictions and suf-fering). The latter is in turn based on the underlying clinging that all phenom-ena (such as the five aggregates) are really or inherently existent, which thusprovides the reference point for all levels of clinging to a personal self. This is whyremoving the clinging to (a) does not affect the clinging to (b). Therefore, it isindispensable to tackle the clinging to real existence in order to fundamentallyeradicate the clinging to a personal self.10062) The seven quotations are the following.a) N›g›rjuna’sPrecious Garlandteaches that cyclic existence functions or comesto an end in dependence on whether there is reification of the five aggregates.As long as the clinging to the aggregates exists,For that long there is also [the clinging to] “me.”Through this identification with “me,”Again, there is karma and thus, again, rebirth.With three paths1007without beginning, middle, or endServing as its mutual causes,This round of cyclic existence spinsLike the round of a circling firebrand.Since this [round] is neither obtained as oneself,Nor others, nor both, nor in the three times,The clinging to “me” is exhausted,And thus karma and birth too.1008428The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 428"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"b) The same text explains why nirv› ̊a is not attained without the realizationthat entities such as the aggregates are without nature:Just as eyes, through being mistaken,Apprehend a circling firebrand,So the sense facultiesApprehend the present objects.Sense faculties and their referentsAre regarded as having the natures of the five elements.Since each of the elements does not exist as a referent,In actual fact, these [faculties and their objects] do not exist as referents.If each of the elements were distinct,[The possibility of] a fire without firewood would follow.If they were a conglomerate, they would be without [distinct] characteristics.It is certain that the same applies to [all] remaining [things too].Since the elements thus do not exist as referentsIn these two ways, there are no referents composed [of them].Since there are no referents composed [of them],In actual fact, also form does not exist as a referent.Likewise, as for consciousness, feelings, discrimination,And formations, an identity of their ownExists neither in all of them nor in them individually.Therefore, in actual fact, they do not exist as referents.Just as we pride ourselves with actual pleasureWhen we have overcome some suffering,So we identify with sufferingWhen it so happens that our pleasure is destroyed.Since they are without nature,The craving to find happinessAnd the craving to be separated from suffering are relinquished.Hence, those who see in this way are released.You may wonder, “What is it that sees?”Conventionally, it is expressed as “mind.”The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 429Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 429"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Without mental events, there is no mind.Since they do not exist as referents, they are not regarded as existent.Knowing thus that, in actuality just as it is,Beings do not exist as referents,Just as a fire [not existing] without its causes,Lacking propensities for and appropriation of [rebirth], one passes into nirv› ̊a.1009One might think that this passage was taught in terms of bodhisattvas attainingthe nonabiding nirv› ̊a of Buddhas. However, the quote up to here does notspeak about bodhisattvas. In clear contrast, they are only mentioned in the nextverse:Also bodhisattvas, upon seeing in this way,Definitely wish for enlightenment.It is solely through their compassionThat they connect with cyclic existence until enlightenment.1010Thus, it is hearers and solitary realizers who, upon realizing that entities are with-out nature, manifest the nirv› ̊a of extinction described above, whereas bod-hisattvas, despite realizing the same, do not pass into this kind of nirv› ̊a.The above reasonings and quotations show not only that hearers and solitaryrealizers indeed realize emptiness—the lack of an intrinsic nature in all phe-nomena—but that such realization is indispensable even for “mere” liberationfrom rebirth in cyclic existence, since it is impossible to realize personal iden-titylessness without realizing phenomenal identitylessness. This is also stated inCandrakırti’s commentary on N›g›rjuna’s Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning:The relinquishment of the afflictions will not happen for those whoassert that it is suitable to relinquish the afflictions despite observing anature of form and so on.1011This means that the clinging to reality or real existence is the kind of ignorancethat serves as the root of cyclic existence and that there is no such clinging in thecontinua of noble ones. Thus, it is the flawless, unique position of the Conse-quentialists that the clinging to reality is necessarily an afflictive obscuration.Furthermore, The Entrance into Centrismsays:Since ignorance obscures its true nature, this is the seeming.The Sage has declared that seeming reality430The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 430"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Is what is fabricated and appears as real through this [ignorance].Thus, fabricated entities are the seeming.1012The Karmapa says that this verse shows that a mental state that apprehendsseeming reality is necessarily an afflictive obscuration, since it is through basicignorance (the root of cyclic existence) that the appearances of seeming reality aredisplayed. Seeming reality appears for ordinary beings in whom this ignorance hasnot subsided, but it does not appear for the noble ones in whom it has subsided.What the latter see during subsequent attainment is called the “mere seeming.”That delusive phenomena (this “mere seeming”) still appear for hearers, solitaryrealizers, and bodhisattvas who have relinquished afflicted ignorance and seethem as similar to the existence of reflections in a mirror is a natural occurrenceon their paths. However, such appearances have no reality for them, since theydo not take them to be real. Therefore, in the sense of appearing as seeming real-ity, mere appearances are only deceiving for ordinary beings. For the noble ones,they are mereseeming and illusionlike fictions that dependently originate. This“mere seeming” appears to them only while they are not in meditative equipoise(that is, when they experience objects that entail appearance), because—unlikeordinary beings—they are only affected by the type of ignorance that is unaf-flicted (the ignorance that constitutes the cognitive obscurations). During theirmeditative equipoise—when they experience the object that is the very lack ofappearance—not even the “mere seeming” appears.As shown above, N›g›rjuna and his spiritual heirs say that without realizingthe lack of reality of the five aggregates—the phenomena that are the bases forimputing a personal self—one cannot realize the nonexistence of such a personalself. Consequently, they say that the conceptions of real existence constitute thetype of ignorance that is an afflictive obscuration. If these conceptions were notthe afflicted type of ignorance, the twelve links of dependent origination wouldnot originate from it. The Seventy Stanzas on Emptinesssays:These conceptions about the actual existenceOf entities that depend on causes and conditionsAre ignorance, the Teacher said.From them, the twelve links originate.1013Such clinging to reality is presented as an afflictive obscuration, since it mainlyobscures liberation from cyclic existence and is not present in the continua ofnoble ones who are liberated from it. The cognitive obscurations that are stillpresent in them consist of the latent tendencies of the clinging to reality plus theclinging to the fact that the aggregates lackany reality and are illusionlike, sinceall of these mainly obscure omniscience.1014The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 431Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 431"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"From this follows a further unique statement of the Consequentialists: thatseeming phenomena do not appear for Buddhas under any circumstances,because the entire flux of mind and mental events has completely subsided. Notseeing any reference points is expressed as seeing their actual nature. As far asordinary beings and other noble ones—arhats and bodhisattvas—are concerned,it is in terms of whether they are affected by afflicted or unafflicted ignorance thatthe Buddha spoke about seeming reality and the mere seeming, respectively.What ordinary beings see as reality plain and simple is seen as something false—a mere seeming—by the noble ones when not in meditative equipoise. The natureof this mere seeming—that is, emptiness (seen from the perspective of these nobleones in meditative equipoise)—is the ultimate. Buddhas do not mistake thisundeceiving ultimate for anything else, but ordinary beings observe it as just thedeceiving phenomena of seeming reality. Since the causes (afflicted and unaf-flicted ignorance) have ceased in Buddhas, their respective results (seeming real-ity and the mere seeming) have subsided too.c) In particular, for the sake of the hearers relinquishing the afflictive obscura-tions, it is also taught in the sÒtras of the hearers that everything conditioned iswithout nature. The quote through which Candrakırti illustrates this is Sa ̇yuttaNik›yaIII.141–2, also cited above by Bh›vaviveka.d–e) In this way, hearers and solitary realizers are taught impermanence throughthe fact that entities perish and thus become terminated. At the same time,through negating that these impermanent entities are ultimately impermanent,the emptiness of them not being established as entities is taught. Instructed in thisway, those who are fortunate enough to gain direct realization of this emptinessas hearers and solitary realizers experientially go beyond their specific philo-sophical systems and pass into nirv› ̊a by realizing that everything conditionedis without nature. Those who are not able to gain such direct realization aretaught that everything conditioned is impermanent, while nirv› ̊a is not. Thus,it is asserted that only the latter are the hearers who propound reifying philo-sophical systems that are based on clinging to real entities. In order to seek for thereal nirv› ̊a in terms of their own path, they seriously engage in the accumula-tions of ethics, studying, and meditative stability. As The Precious Garlandsays:“Nonarising” as taught in the great vehicleAnd “termination” as in other [sÒtras] are emptiness.In actual fact, termination and nonarising are the same.Hence, bear with [the great vehicle as the Buddha’s word].1015The Fundamental Versesstates:432The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 432"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Through his knowledge of entities and nonentities,In The Instruction for K›ty›yana,The Victor has refutedBoth [their] existence and nonexistence.1016One might think, “Then hearers and solitary realizers would relinquish thecognitive obscurations, since they realize phenomenal identitylessness.” This isnot the case, since then it would equally follow that all obscurations are relin-quished on the path of seeing of the great vehicle. Hearers and solitary realizersdo not familiarize themselves with phenomenal identitylessness for countless eonsfor the sake of relinquishing the cognitive obscurations, because they alreadyattain their specific result of mere liberation from cyclic existence by having prac-ticed for a few lifetimes.To this, some say, “Then the cognitive obscurations that are relinquished bybodhisattvas on the sixth ground and below would equally be relinquished bythose arhats of hearers and solitary realizers who abide for countless eons in med-itative absorption in the expanse without remainder. The reason is that the lat-ter in this way gain familiarity with phenomenal identitylessness for manycountless eons and that bodhisattvas on the sixth ground and below are not ableto outshine these arhats through their own mental power.”There are two answers to this reasoning: one in terms of content and the otherin terms of format. First, arhats without remainder and bodhisattvas are not com-parable in this respect. Arhats without remainder familiarize themselves withphenomenal identitylessness through abiding in the meditative absorption of ces-sation that is characterized by phenomenal identitylessness, but they do not famil-iarize themselves with phenomenal identitylessness for the sake of relinquishingthe cognitive obscurations. Even if they did so, due to their duller faculties, unlikebodhisattvas, they would not be able to relinquish the cognitive obscurations.The second answer in terms of the above reasoning’s format is that the entail-ment of the predicate by the reason is not certain, because from such entailmentit would follow that bodhisattvas on the seventh ground and below relinquish theentirety of the afflicted mind and the afflictions. The reason for this is that,according to the above opponents, hearers and solitary realizers have relinquishedthe entirety of the afflicted mind and the afflictions immediately upon becom-ing arhats while not at all having realized phenomenal identitylessness and noteven having meditated for a long time on personal identitylessness either, whereasbodhisattvas have familiarized themselves with both types of identitylessness formany eons.f) Some might further object, “Then the teachings of the great vehicle becomepointless, since also the vehicles of hearers and solitary realizers teach phenome-The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 433Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 433"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"nal identitylessness, which means that there is no difference between the dharmaapproaches of the great and lesser vehicles.” One cannot say that there is no dif-ference, because it is not the case that the great vehicle does not teach anythingbut phenomenal identitylessness. Rather, it teaches the grounds, the perfections,and the great aspiration prayers of bodhisattvas; the four immeasurables; the ded-ications for great enlightenment; the two accumulations; and that the Buddhasteach the dharma by residing on a single atom while at the same time being sur-rounded by a retinue equal in number to all atoms that exist in the universe.Thus, in the great vehicle, there are these and infinitely many other ways in whichthe inconceivable nature of phenomena is presented in relation to all phenom-ena within the two realities. As The Precious Garlandsays:In the vehicle of the hearers,The aspiration prayers, the conduct, and the dedicationsOf bodhisattvas are not explained.So how could one become a bodhisattva through it?In the sÒtras [of the hearers], [the Buddha] did not discussThe topics concerned with the conduct of bodhisattvas,But he discussed them in the great vehicle.Therefore, the learned should accept it [as Buddha’s word].1017g) Some people might argue now, “It is not justified to say that the perfectionsand so on are not taught in the vehicles of the hearers and solitary realizers,because they have generosity and so on there, which—according to what is saidhere—is seized by the supreme knowledge that realizes phenomenal identity-lessness.” This is not the case, since hearers and solitary realizers do not have gen-erosity and such that possess the six kinds of genuineness (such as dedicationsdeliberately made for the welfare of all sentient beings), the four dharmas, the fouror eight qualities, or the twelve kinds of genuineness.1018“But is it not the case thatbeing seized by the realization of phenomenal identitylessness represents the cri-terion that makes generosity and so on the perfection of generosity and so on?”In general, the criterion for presenting generosity and so on as the perfections isexplained as follows: Presupposing the generation of the mind of enlightenmentas its basis, if generosity does not lead to going beyond this world, it is mere gen-erosity, but if it does so, it is the perfection of generosity.The gist of this is as follows: The actions of the body, speech, and mind ofnoble hearers and solitary realizers that are seized by the realization of both kindsof identitylessness do not become the perfections and the grounds of bodhisattvas.Hearers and solitary realizers strive only for liberation from cyclic existence; theydo not train and engage in the perfections and grounds of bodhisattvas for the434The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 434"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"sake of knowing the infinity of knowable objects for the welfare of others. More-over, in the vehicles of hearers and solitary realizers, phenomenal identityless-ness is not taught extensively but only in a very concise form. If phenomenalidentitylessness were not taught in at least a concise form, hearers and solitaryrealizers would not become liberated from cyclic existence by becoming arhats.At the same time, even if phenomenal identitylessness were taught extensively, itis not something that they strive for. As The Praise to the Supramundanestates:Without realizing signlessness,You said, there is no liberation.Therefore, you taught itFully in the great vehicle.1019As for the meaning of phenomenal identitylessness being concise or extensive,some Tibetans say that this refers to the conciseness or extensiveness of the natureof phenomenal identitylessness (as that which is to be proven) or to the concise-ness or extensiveness of reasonings (as the means to prove it). However, neitherof these is justified, because phenomenal identitylessness is not established by anature of its own in the first place. In it, neither conciseness nor extensiveness canbe observed. Rather, it is as follows: What bears characteristics is called a phe-nomenon. The understanding that a phenomenon is free from characteristics inthe sense that it is empty of them is expressed as phenomenal identitylessness.This is absolutely equal for all three kinds of noble ones (hearers, solitary realiz-ers, and bodhisattvas). Even for bodhisattvas, there is nothing to be realized thatis a more extensive phenomenal identitylessness superior to that.Regarding the reasonings (the means of proof), if phenomenal identityless-ness is established through the concise means of proof stated in the lesser vehi-cle, there is no need for extensive means of proof in the great vehicle, since thelatter would just prove what is already established in the lesser vehicle. On theother hand, if phenomenal identitylessness is not established through the concisemeans of proof in the lesser vehicle, it would be appropriate to teach phenome-nal identitylessness through very extensive means of proof even to hearers andsolitary realizers.Thus, the meaning of concise versus extensive phenomenal identitylessness isas follows: It is presented as concise or extensive in terms of whether certain per-sons reveal or do not reveal that the nature of phenomena—the nature of beingidentityless—is related to every seeming bearer of this nature in the sense of sup-port and supported. From among the entirety of phenomena that bear this nature,hearers and solitary realizers realize the following to be not established through anature of their own: the aggregates, sources, and constituents that make up theirown continua and are conditioned by karma and afflictions, as well as the phe-The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 435Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 435"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"nomena of the uncontaminated reality of the path. This is all they are interestedin for the sake of attaining personal liberation. However, they are not concernedabout and thus do not reveal the nature of phenomena in its relation to all remain-ing knowable objects pertaining to themselves and all other beings. These know-able objects include the cause that is not conditioned by the karma and afflictionscontained in one’s own continuum (the Heart of the Blissfully Gone Ones); theinconceivable true nature of the seeming way of appearance that depends on thiscause (such as noble bodhisattvas, through their activities of accumulation andpurification, emanating Buddhas equal in number to all atoms in the universe ona single atom and then withdrawing them); and the results of such practices (suchas the Dharma Body and the wisdom of the expanse of dharmas).Hearers and solitary realizers do not reveal the nature of phenomena in itsrelation to all knowable objects without exception, because they are not interestedin and thus do not strive for omniscience with regard to all knowable objects. Inparticular, the nature of phenomena in relation to the Dharma Body and thewisdom of the expanse of dharmas as specific bearers of this nature is realized onlyby those who possess the Dharma Body of a Buddha. It is not realized by anyhearers, solitary realizers, or bodhisattvas, since the Dharma Body and its wisdomare not the spheres of any minds in which the latent tendencies of the threeobscurations have not been completely cleansed. This is expressed not only byCandrakırti but also by Bh›vaviveka’s Heart of Centrism:This Dharma Body of the BuddhasThat is endowed with countless accumulations of meritAnd knows infinite knowable objectsIs the peace in which discursiveness is at peace.It is not seen by fleshly eyes,Nor is it seen by divine eyes.It is difficult to see for any consciousnessThat is conceptual or nonconceptual.It is neither the object of the higher realms nor [the object] of those with negative deeds,Neither [the object] of those without afflictions nor [the object] of those with [afflictions].Just as the sun is not an object of the blind,It is not the sphere of dialecticians.1020As for those hearers and solitary realizers who have gone beyond philosophi-cal systems and thus have attained true realization, from the point of view of436The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 436"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"having no clinging to the reality of cessation being substantially established, theyare portrayed as having realized phenomenal identitylessness. On the other hand,it is also said that possessing the realization of the reality of cessation being uncon-ditioned does not amount to having meditated on phenomenal identitylessnessin all its extensiveness. Still, in a general sense, these two statements may well beconsidered equivalent. The point is that, despite such hearers and solitary realiz-ers realizing identitylessness in a concise way, that is, to the limited extent cov-ered by the lack of reality of conditioned phenomena, they do not extensively andfully realize that unconditioned phenomena as well are free from all discursive-ness and reference points. Thus, from the point of view of phenomenal iden-titylessness as what is to be proven, the realizations of the above hearers andsolitary realizers do not amount to the extensive realization of phenomenal iden-titylessness. In terms of mere identitylessness and the mere lack of reality as whatis to be proven, they indeed have realized a mere negation (of identity and real-ity) that in itself is free from being concise or extensive. However, as for certaininstances of phenomena from among the four realities (as the phenomena that arethe bases for what is to be proven), while not (actively) apprehending them ashaving an identity, they also do not realize their identitylessness. Therefore, theydo not fully realize extensive phenomenal identitylessness.Another common example for this is that when you drink a sip of ocean waterat the Florida coast, you know how “the ocean” tastes, since its taste is the sameeverywhere. However, despite knowing this, you do not know all the places in theworld where you could possibly taste the ocean (such as the beaches of theBahamas or the depths of the Pacific), nor have you tasted the ocean in all theseplaces.Some people might think, “Then it follows that hearers and solitary realizersdo not realize phenomenal identitylessness, because they do not realize it in termsof certain instances of phenomena.” But then it should equally follow that one’sown visual consciousness does not cognize blue, because it does not cognize allblues that exist among knowable objects. “But it would follow that hearers andsolitary realizers belong to the great vehicle, since they are Centrists in whosecontinua the realization of the two kinds of identitylessness has arisen.” Even ifcertain people may be Centrists, they do not have to be Centrists who propoundthe philosophical system of Centrism. And even if they do, vehicles and philo-sophical systems are different categories. So how could this follow?In other words, hearers and solitary realizers definitely see the mere condi-tionality of dependent origination, but they do not have the fully complete cul-tivation of phenomenal identitylessness, because they do not emphasize theknowledge of all knowable objects and the welfare of all sentient beings. In acomparatively short time, through meditating on the phenomenal identityless-ness of the aggregates, sources, and constituents of their own continua, theyThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 437Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 437"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"merely relinquish the afflictions of engaging in the three realms of cyclic existence.Thus, they possess complete cultivation of personal identitylessness.Bodhisattvas gather the accumulation of wisdom for the welfare of all sentientbeings for countless eons. They do so through realizing phenomenal identity-lessness (the ultimate mind of enlightenment that actually makes them attainBuddhahood) and its being connected as one in taste to the infinite dharmas ofthe seeming mind of enlightenment (the secondary causes for attaining Bud-dhahood). Thus, their accumulation of wisdom becomes equal in extent to theinfinite number of all these bearers of the nature of phenomena. Through this,they attain the profound and vast Dharma Body of a Buddha. Hearers and soli-tary realizers cultivate phenomenal identitylessness in a way in which the twotypes of the mind of enlightenment are dissociated; that is, their realization ofphenomenal identitylessness is not unified with the vast dharmas of noble bod-hisattvas that cause the latter to attain completely perfect Buddhahood. There-fore, hearers and solitary realizers attain their final direct realization ofphenomenal identitylessness by entering the expanse of complete release. How-ever, through this way of cultivating phenomenal identitylessness, not even atiny bit of the qualities of the Dharma Body appears for them.TConclusionThe Summary of the Distinction between Autonomists and ConsequentialistsReferring to the oral instructions of the Eighth Karmapa, Pawo Rinpoche sum-marizes the basic difference between Autonomists and Consequentialists as fol-lows:“A sprout as the subject is without arising, because it is free from aris-ing from any of the four extremes, just as a frog’s long hair.”Here, master Bhavya states [this as] the main argument, and then heformulates four autonomous reasons as the means to prove the subjectproperty. The venerable and fearless Candrakırti presents this by label-ing the mere refutation of arising from the four extremes a “position.”He teaches the invalidation of the opposite [positions] of this [refuta-tion] through consequences that expose contradictions and throughthe analogous applicability of the [opponents’] reason [to somethingthat contradicts their position]. However, he does not formulate amain argument, nor does he assert arguments that establish the subjectproperty through valid cognition. It is merely on the grounds of this438The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 438"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"[difference] that one refers to Autonomists and Consequentialists.1021Apart from this main point, he lists some further ancillary differences in terms ofground, path, and fruition:In the context of the ground, there is the difference that [Autonomists]present the seeming in accordance with proponents of philosophicalsystems [such as the SÒtra Followers or the Yog›c›ras] and that [Con-sequentialists] present it in accordance with common worldly consen-sus.1022When presenting the ultimate, [Autonomists] accept objects(that is, seeming [phenomena]), that bear the nature of phenomena,while [Consequentialists] do not accept such. [Another difference is]that [Autonomists] accept valid cognition that is undeceiving withrespect to objects (that is, conventional reality), and [Consequential-ists] do not accept such.In the context of the path, [Autonomists] settle in meditative equipoisewithin spacelike emptiness of appearance and [Consequentialists] set-tle in meditative equipoise within illusionlike emptiness of reality.In the context of the result, they differ in that [Autonomists state that]the aspects of the seeming emerge within the self-appearances of thewisdom that knows the extent [of phenomena],1023while such is not thecase [for Consequentialists].1024They also have a different [opinion] asto whether discursiveness is ended gradually or all at once.For those with sharp faculties who take the instantaneous approach, theConsequentialist [approach] is better, and for those with weaker fac-ulties who take the gradual approach, the Autonomist [approach] isbetter. Some [aspects] of the seeming [reality] of yogins have to beaccepted by both Autonomists and Consequentialists after analysisthrough reasoning, such as the four seals of the view that are a sign ofthe Buddha’s speech and the aspect of emptiness of reality free from dis-cursiveness. It is not that these [aspects] are presented as the seemingfrom the point of view of having been analyzed [and found] throughreasoning. Rather, they are presented as the seeming from the point ofview of [still] apprehending characteristics in what is analyzed.1025The Five Main Points of ConsequentialismThe Treasury of Knowledgesummarizes Consequentialism in five main points,1026which accord with the presentation by the Eighth Karmapa:The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 439Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 439"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"1) All phenomena are only nominally existent. Let alone from the perspective of rea-soning, all presentations in terms of conventional valid cognition or nonvalidcognition and of anything that could be established by such valid cognition arerejected even on the conventional level. All phenomena are just mental imputa-tions through language, thinking, and means of expression; that is, they existonly nominally. Thus, it is explained that horses and oxen in a dream and in thewaking state are completely equal in terms of being real or false. This includes therejection of autonomous reasoning in the sense that the subject and the threemodes are established through valid cognition as commonly appearing to bothparties.2) Conditioned phenomena are necessarily false and deceiving. Not only do theynot withstand analysis through reasoning, but there is not even a trace of some-thing that is established from the perspective of reasoning. Consequently, thereis no common locus between conditioned phenomena and what is establishedthrough valid cognition. If thoroughly analyzed, even nirv› ̊a (or any hypothet-ical phenomenon that may be superior to it) definitely does not exist as somethingthat is established from its own side. Nevertheless, from the perspective of slightanalysis, it is explained that solely nirv› ̊a is undeceiving.3) The clinging to reality is an afflictive obscuration. The root of cyclic existence isthe clinging to real existence. If it is not eliminated, liberation from the clingingto a self and the ensuing afflictions is impossible. Therefore, the afflictive obscu-rations consist of the clinging to reality and all afflictions together with theiraccompanying mental factors that are produced through this clinging. The cog-nitive obscurations are described briefly as the clinging to characteristics and indetail as “the one hundred eight conceptions about the apprehended and theapprehender.” Thus, Consequentialists do not assert any common locus betweenclinging to reality and cognitive obscurations. As explained earlier, this also estab-lishes that the realization of phenomenal identitylessness is indispensable for theliberation of hearers and solitary realizers.4) The wisdom on the paths of seeing of the three vehicles is equal. In fact, the pathsof seeing in the three vehicles neither have several moments1027nor are they dis-tinct in terms of their insights. Rather, The Entrance into Centrismstates that thesingle wisdom that sees the single nature of phenomena is identical in the nom-inal three vehicles:Also this insight that is the subject of true reality is not disparate.Hence, you taught that the dissimilar vehicles for beings are notdistinct.1028440The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 440"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"The autocommentary says that there are different ways of seeing through study-ing, reflecting, and meditating on true reality, but true reality as such is withoutdivisions and change. Hence, also the wisdom as the subject that realizes truereality is of a single nature. If the nature of this wisdom were multiple, it wouldnot realize true reality, because it would not realize its nature just as it is. Sincetrue reality is single, the wisdom that realizes it cannot be disparate. Hence, thereis only a single vehicle and not three vehicles. As a sÒtra says:K›Ÿyapa, when all phenomena are realized to be equality, this isnirv› ̊a. It is just a single one and not two or three.10295) The appearing of Buddhas is a mere appearance for others. Just like a wish-ful-filling jewel or a garuda reliquary, the Form Bodies and enlightened activities ofBuddhas are free from thoughts, without the need for any mental impulse of anintention upon which to act. Rather, they are nothing but the free display ofappearances for other beings which comes about under the influence of formeraspiration prayers by the Buddhas and the good karma of particular beings to betrained. From a Buddha’s own perspective, however, all appearances of con-sciousness and objects of consciousness have completely vanished.Concluding RemarksAs was amply shown, the Autonomist-Consequentialist controversy arose notfrom a disagreement on emptiness or ultimate reality but from different opinionson how to communicate the realization of it to others. A brief look at the par-ticular context in the general history of Indian thought from which this method-ological disagreement appeared may be helpful.Bh›vaviveka lived in the middle of a long period of great fertility and evolu-tion in Indian philosophy as a whole. His training was not only Buddhist; he hadan encyclopedic knowledge of all branches of traditional Sanskrit learning, includ-ing the common fields of education (such as grammar and poetry) and all non-Buddhist philosophical systems. In order to defend Centrism against bothBuddhist and non-Buddhist schools (which had evolved greatly since the time ofN›g›rjuna), he seems to have seen it as his task to extensively study and refutethe manifold tenets of his opponents on their own grounds through the meansof commonly accepted probative arguments. At that time in India, the commonrules of debate required that in order to uphold one’s position, one had to proveit by arguments that contain reasons and examples. In addition, one was expectedto refute, by the same approach, the counterpositions and eventual objections ofone’s opponents. One’s position could not contradict immediate perception,one’s own words, or commonly acknowledged consensus. Also, the reasons fordefending one’s position could not be unrelated to the subject, contradictory,The Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 441Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 441"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"uncertain, or otherwise lacking validity. So Bh›vaviveka seems to have empha-sized probative arguments with all their requirements in order to comply with thecontemporary standards of debate and reasoning. In combination with his exten-sive discussions of Buddhist and non-Buddhist schools, this may be seen as aneffort to ground Centrism within a common logico-epistemological frameworkmutually acknowledged by Centrists and their realist opponents. In other words,he attempted to “dress up” Centrism in a way that he thought would make it amore relevant player in accordance with the rules on the large stage of generalphilosophical inquiry of his time. That this approach obviously was quite suc-cessful is evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of later Centrists in Indiamore or less followed it.Clearly, one of the few who did not follow Bh›vaviveka in this was Can-drakırti. The main thrust of his critique of Bh›vaviveka seems to be that the lat-ter, by his use of probative arguments, compromises too much of N›g›rjuna’sradical message that leaves not a single one of our belief systems and referencepoints—not even Buddhahood and nirv› ̊a—unassailed. In other words,Bh›vaviveka reintroduces a plethora of old and new reference points rather thanfocusing on the main goal of Centrism, which is the elimination of all referencepoints altogether. For Candrakırti, Bh›vaviveka definitely stepped over thedemarcation line of the pedagogically unavoidable use of discursiveness and ref-erence points that is necessary for guiding others to utter freedom from such dis-cursiveness. In a way, for Candrakırti (and certainly for N›g›rjuna too),Bh›vaviveka tried to lock up the wild bird of emptiness in the cage of conven-tional reference points, such as formal arguments. A bird may touch the earthonce in a while, but its actual nature is to roam in the sky without restrictions andindependent of the earth. Thus, if one is to experience the free flight of a bird, itdoes not help to make it sit still by trapping it in a cage and then counting itsfeathers.On the other hand, leaving aside ontological or epistemological commitments,it can be said that all Centrists are both Autonomists and Consequentialists inthat they use both approaches to reasoning, though certain masters prefer theone over the other. In other words, it is a matter of choice whether faultfindingor probative arguments are employed to point to emptiness, but the fundamen-tal objective—making others realize the nature of phenomena—is exactly thesame for all Centrists. Thus, the difference lies in the way the ultimate is com-municated. As implied by the Eighth Karmapa, the more radical style of Conse-quentialists may involve difficulties for some people in that it “shoots too highto soon,” since, right from the start, it does not provide anything to hold onto and just cuts through any ground one may try to stand on. The Autonomistapproach is in many ways more down to earth in the sense of at least initiallybeing more grounded in and allowing for our ordinary thinking. It may thus be442The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 442"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"considered by some people to provide a more convenient framework for peelingaway the many layers of our belief systems in a more gradual and moderatemanner.From all that has been said on the Autonomist-Consequentialist distinction,it should be clear that there are many other—quite different—dividing lines thatcould be drawn between individual Centrist masters. In particular, the evidentdifferences may be considered between Bh›vaviveka (who extensively attacked theYog›c›ra system) on the one hand and ⁄›ntarak ̋ita and KamalaŸıla (who adoptedthis system in many respects) on the other, with Jñ›nagarbha somewhere inbetween. Apart from their having a similar approach to reasoning, it is far fromclear why they should all belong to a particular Centrist subschool called Auton-omists with a common set of fixed doctrines. When looking at their own works(and not only at later classification schemes), many other subsequent Indian Cen-trists, such as Haribhadra, Abhayak›ragupta, Bodhibhadra, Ratn›karaŸ›nti, andAtıŸa also defy any easy classification. The same goes for many early TibetanCentrists. Of the vast and intricate web of doxographical distinctions over thecenturies, Ruegg says:The fact that texts (and masters) that differ significantly in their doc-trines have sometimes been assigned by authors of doxographical andphilosophical works to a single division or category, such as theSv›tantrika or Pr›saºgika branches of the Madhyamaka, appears toindicate that such taxonomies current in Tibet . . . have often to dowith lines of magisterial transmission and pupillary succession . . .rather than with immutable and altogether discrete philosophical posi-tions and with standardized and uniform school doctrines. Still, astemplates . . . these categorizations and taxonomies might be thoughtto have their uses for descriptive, interpretative or heuristic purposesin historical and philosophical discussion and analysis.With respect to both the Indian and the earlier Tibetan Madhyamakaauthors they can, however, hardly be expected to provide a compre-hensive and definitive frame or norm for analyzing and classifying thetotality of the doctrines and philosophemes that have been subsumedby doxographers under a given taxonomic category; nor can it be sup-posed that the elaborate nomenclature for doctrinal divisions and sub-divisions used in the doxographical taxonomies would always havebeen familiar to these masters themselves.1030In particular, as for Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrism, given the lack ofsubstantial differences between Autonomists and Consequentialists, the all butThe Distinction between Autonomists and Consequentialists 443Center Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 443"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"dominant position of Candrakırti in India, the almost complete lack of Indiancommentaries on his works, and, in contrast, the wealth of literature by otherIndian Centrists (be they Autonomists or others), one may wonder why—fromabout the fourteenth or fifteenth century onward—this one of all texts becamethe single Centrist work to serve as the absolutely predominant basis for Centriststudies at Tibetan monastic colleges. The issue is certainly rather complex, butthere seem to be two main reasons. One was the intense propagation of Can-drakırti’s works by Tsongkhapa and the predominant Gelugpa school, pro-claiming them as the only correct explanation of Centrism, superior in particularto all Autonomists. The other reason has more to do with the structure and con-tents of The Entrance into Centrism. Unlike most other Centrist texts, it not onlyexplains the classical Centrist topics by giving explanations on the meaning of TheFundamental Versesbut combines them with an outline of the path and itsfruition as described in The SÒtra of the Ten Grounds. Thus, Candrakırti’s textdoes not merely discuss the Centrist view; it also describes the nature and thequalities of the ten causal grounds of bodhisattvas as well as the resultant level ofBuddhahood with its enlightened bodies and wisdom.As a final consideration of all these distinctions that may seem clear and obvi-ous at first glance, it seems that the more we look into their details and try to iden-tify what exactly it is that separates the various Autonomist and Consequentialistmasters, the more this process in itself becomes a perfect example of the Centristprinciple that there is nothing to be found under analysis. Given this result of notfinding anything, the obvious question is, why should we even bother investi-gating all these different views and their negations? It is precisely for this resultof not finding anything. To the extent that we work our way through various dis-tinctions, they become the means to sharpen our wisdom and let go of all refer-ence points in order to approach the actual experience of what they are all talkingabout. As Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso’s Magical Keysays:The manifold divisions of vehicles in this wayAre means to put an end to discursiveness.Thus, once actual equality free from discursiveness is realized,The analysis of views is completed.Although the progressive stages of views differ,In the basic original nature, there is no difference.The apprehension of differences is the flaw of thinking mind,Eventually merging into the Great Seal’s nature free fromconsciousness.1031444The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-02 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 444"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"T4 Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka?Most people thinkthat, in terms of its Madhyamaka alignment, the Kagyüschool is a monolithic bloc of staunch supporters of Shentong-Madhyamaka(“other-empty Madhyamaka”).

Even Milarepa sometimes adopts a typical Rangtong (“self-empty”)approach in his enlightened songs.1032Still, the reader may be wondering why abook on Madhyamaka in the Kagyü lineage has thus far barely mentioned theterm “Shentong,” much less presented the system it refers to.

Rather,the reason is quite the contrary, since what is called Shentong is nothing otherthan the Yog›c›ra1033(Yoga Practice) system of Maitreya, Asaºga, andVasubandhu, also called “the lineage of vast activity.”1034Just like Centrism, in itsrich entirety, this system is a distinct, well-established, and—at least in India—unequivocally renowned system of presenting the teachings of the Buddha. Itcan stand very well on its own and has no need to be included under Centrismor even to be promoted as the better brand of Centrism. It is all the more inap-propriate to wrongly subsume it—as many Tibetan doxographies do—under thequestionable category of “Mere Mentalism”1035and thus regard it as inferior toCentrism. It would definitely contribute to the appreciation of this Yog›c›ra sys-tem for what it is if it were called neither Mere Mentalism nor Shentong butsimply “the Yog›c›ra System of Maitreya/Asaºga” or “the lineage of vast activ-ity.” The following presentation will provide sufficient evidence for this by high-Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 445"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"lighting some essential points of Yog›c›ra in the original texts, consulting themain Kagyü sources on both Centrism and Yog›c›ra, and comparing the rela-tionship between these two systems.1036As for the question of whether there is a Shentong-Madhyamaka, both theEighth Karmapa and Pawo Rinpoche give a very clear answer: “No!” They notonly refute any realistic interpretation of what the word shentongmight refer to,such as the notion of a permanent, intrinsically existing Buddha nature;1037theysimply consider this term a misnomer altogether. At the same time, the two sys-tems of N›g›rjuna—the lineage of profound view—and Asaºga—the lineage ofvast activity (to which the term “Shentong” usually refers) are clearly distinguished.When questioned, The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche confirmed that it is indeedbetter to make a distinction in terms of the lineages of profound view and vast con-duct than between some lineages of “Rangtong” and “Shentong,” since the formertwo are the clear lineages of transmission that can be traced back to India. PawoRinpoche explicitly explains that the final intention of these two systems is iden-tical, while the Eighth Karmapa in his Chariot of the Tagbo Siddhasdoes so implic-itly.1038Moreover, Pawo Rinpoche emphasizes that what Tibetans call “MindOnly” or “Mere Mentalism” is not the lineage of vast activity.1039In his Chariotcommentary, the Eighth Karmapa says that, in general, there isno difference between Buddha ⁄›kyamuni and Maitreya in that they are bothBuddhas. However, the sole teacher of this realm of Buddha activity who appearsas the Supreme Emanation Body of a perfect Buddha is Buddha ⁄›kyamuni, andthere is no dispute that he prophesied N›g›rjuna and Asaºga as the founders ofCentrism and Yog›c›ra. Thus, whoever is a Centrist in the setting of the teach-ings of this realm must definitely be in accord with the Centrism of N›g›rjuna andhis spiritual heirs. Imputations of different kinds of Centrism (such as one specificto Maitreya) that do not correspond to N›g›rjuna’s system are rejected by theEighth Karmapa. He says that if there were a Centrism of Maitreya, then it wouldbe equally fine to present innumerable forms of Centrism, such as the eight kindsof Centrism that were asserted by the eight close bodhisattva sons of the Buddhaand the thousand different kinds of Centrism that are asserted by the thousandBuddhas of this fortunate eon. Some people might object that if this newly namedCentrism of Maitreya does not fulfill the function of actual Centrism, then theCentrism of N›g›rjuna also would not fulfill this function, because both systemfounders are equal in being noble bodhisattvas. However, by using the same kindof argument, it would then also follow that the vehicles of the hearers and solitaryrealizers that were taught by the Buddha are the great vehicle, because they areequal in being vehicles and being spoken by the Buddha.The Karmapa corrects another misunderstanding regarding what is called “self-emptiness” and “other-emptiness.” He says that some Tibetans assert the absenceof a nature of their own in phenomena as being the meaning of “self-emptiness”446The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 446"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"and the absence of other phenomena as being the meaning of “other-emptiness.”This is not justified, because such an explanation or terminology does not existin the topics of the sÒtras on emptiness. Nor is it found anywhere in the treatisesof the two system founders N›g›rjuna and Asaºga, whose authority in this mat-ter rests at least in part on the fact that they were prophesied by the Buddha asthe ones to comment on the intentions of the topics of these very sÒtras in termsof Centrism and Yog›c›ra respectively.In particular, the Eighth Karmapa takes issue with the position of DölpopaSherab Gyaltsen, which he reports as follows: “On the level of seeming reality,phenomena are empty of a nature of their own. Therefore, they are self-empty.In ultimate reality, the supreme other consciousness that is not empty of its ownnature—the permanent entity of the Heart of the Blissfully Gone Ones—isempty of all other seeming phenomena. This is explained as ‘other-empty.’ TheCentrists who propound other-emptiness are the Great Centrists, and the Cen-trists who propound self-emptiness turn the Centrist view into something likepoison.”The Karmapa regards such an explanation as a deprecation of the meaning ofPrajñ›p›ramit› for several reasons. To start with, if one claims an ultimate phe-nomenon that is really established and not empty of its own nature, this contra-dicts the Buddha’s determination of the definitive meaning, which is that allphenomena are emptiness. In particular, this explanation is also contradictory toall commentaries on the intention of this definitive meaning that were given byCentrists, including firyavimuktisena and Haribhadra, the two main Indian com-mentators on the hidden meaning of the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras. With regard to“the emptiness of other-entity,”1040the sÒtras clearly negate this “other-empti-ness” by saying, “Since it lacks any solid abiding and ceasing, it is empty of itself.”Following this, firyavimuktisena, Ratn›karaŸ›nti, and others say, “Since it is anemptiness that is not produced by others, it is the emptiness of other-entity” and“Since it is the entity that is not produced by others, it is the other-entity.” Thus,they take solely the emptiness that is natural emptiness (and not any nonemptyentity) as the basis of being empty of something other. On the other hand, in thescriptures, there never appear any reifying explanations in the sense that, by tak-ing the supreme and permanent other-entity—the Heart of the Blissfully GoneOnes—as the basis for emptiness, this Heart is empty of all other seeming phe-nomena and that this is the meaning of other-emptiness.Before Dölpopa, the Karmapa says, nobody in India or Tibet had ever statedthat there are these two systems of “self-emptiness” and “other-emptiness” withinthe philosophical system of Centrism. If one follows Centrism, it is impossibleto assert an ultimate phenomenon that is really established and to say at the sametime that the seeming is without reality in that it is empty in the sense of self-emptiness. If one were to propound something like this, one would just be aIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka?447Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 447"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"realist. It is obvious that one cannot be a realist and at the same time speak aboutthe center free from all reference points.In his commentary on The Ornament of Clear Realization, the Eighth Karmapaidentifies the correct referent of using the term “other-empty” in an expedient,functional way (if one wants to use this term, that is). However, he emphasizesthat the nature of phenomena is neither self-empty nor other-empty anyway, letalone really existent:The name “other-empty” is applied to emptiness [in the sense] that theother features within this basis [emptiness] are empty of their ownrespective natures. Therefore, the other-empty’s own nature does notbecome nonempty. The reason for this is that the name “other-empty”is [only] applied to the compound meaning that this basis [ empti-ness] is empty of such and such [and not to this basis being other-empty in itself].1041However, it is not asserted that this basis—thenature of phenomena—is empty of its own nature. [Likewise, as wasjust said,] this [basis itself] is not other-empty either. Therefore, if itis not other-empty, forget about it being self-empty [since these twoare just mutually dependent]. . .This basis—the nature of phenomena—is neither other-empty norself-empty, because [let alone being other-empty or self-empty,] it isnot even suitable as a mere emptiness that is not specified as beingempty or not empty of itself or something other. The reason for thisis that it has the essential character of being the utter peace of all dis-cursiveness regarding being empty and not being empty. Thus, fromthe perspective of the [actual] freedom from discursiveness, no char-acteristics whatsoever of being empty of itself or something other tran-spire within the basis that is the nature of phenomena.1042In brief, “other-empty” in this sense, as a mere matter of conventional parlance,means the following. By definition, emptiness can in no way be identified or rei-fied. It is the very freedom from all reference points, not still another referencepoint. So, it is nothing but this emptiness that is empty of everything “other,”such as reifications, discursiveness, reference points, and so on.As for wisdom, it cannot be an ultimate entity either. In his Chariot, theKarmapa adds that some proponents of other-emptiness assert that it is not con-sciousness that is ultimately existent, but wisdom, and that this is the crucial dif-ference between Mere Mentalism and the Centrism of other-emptiness.However, he says, this is just an attempt to sell Mere Mentalism as Centrism. Foras long as a really established cognition in the sense of a momentary, mere men-448The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 448"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"tal experience that is clear and aware is asserted, it does not matter whether thisis called consciousness or wisdom.Therefore, Mikyö Dorje says that he does not at all direct his mind to any ofthe various presentations of Centrism, Yog›c›ra, or any other system by thosepeople who say that Centrism has this twofold division into the Centrism of self-emptiness and the Centrism of other-emptiness. Among such people, some claimthat the view of the Centrism of self-emptiness is higher and others the opposite.Rather, the Karmapa says that he prefers to present the philosophical systems ofCentrism and Yog›c›ra and so on from their own sides and in their own rightthrough correct reasons.1043Pawo Rinpoche presents the contradiction inherent in the claim of some peo-ple who say that the Centrism explained in the second turning of the wheel ofdharma represents the teaching on self-emptiness and that the Centrism explainedin the final turning of the wheel of dharma is the teaching on other-emptiness,which represents the ultimate view. Since the perfection of knowledge has alreadybeen explained in the second turning, these people implicitly accept that the finalturning is not the perfection of knowledge; and since its teachings are notincluded in any of the other perfections either, they would consequently not evenbelong to the great vehicle. These people might then object that the teachings ofthe final turning belong to the category of meditative stability, the fifth perfec-tion. However, according to this position, the direct fruition of meditative sta-bility—the perfection of supreme knowledge—is self-emptiness. Therefore, to saythat the third turning belongs to the category of meditative stability contradictstheir claim that this turning is the ultimate view—that is, other-emptiness—since its fruition is self-emptiness.Then, Pawo Rinpoche takes on the position of “some Tibetan scholars who areas well-known as the sun and the moon.”1044They say, “One must definitelyaccept a middle between the two extremes. This is the great ultimate that is emptyof other. It is a permanent, unchanging, and solid entity that is empty of adven-titious stains and not empty of all Buddha qualities, such as the ten powers. Thisis the great kingdom of wisdom.”Pawo Rinpoche refutes this view by pointing to the intentions behind differ-ent presentations of emptiness. Although there surely are many explanations thatthe nature of phenomena is permanent and lasting and such, these explanationsare given with particular issues in mind. For example, the descriptions of theinfinite positive qualities of Buddhas are provided in order to eliminate clingingto a certain kind of limited emptiness, that is, taking the ultimate to be utternonexistence. Such explanations may also be given for those pure disciples whoare already released from believing in extremes, such as permanence and extinc-tion. Obviously, these disciples would no longer set up any reference points interms of superimposition and denial, no matter how they are taught the natureIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 449Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 449"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"of phenomena. They are like people who are cured of a disease and have regainedtheir full strength. Such people may relish all kinds of tasty and nourishing dishes.However, the dietary situation of those people who suffer from the nasty illnessof being inflated by entertaining reference points is a different story. They are def-initely in need of curing this disease through the purging medicine of emptiness.As for a middle and extremes, these are only established in mutual dependence.Thus, if the extremes have been refuted, their middle cannot be established either,because a middle without extremes is impossible. If there is a middle, there arealso extremes, because as long as there is clinging to a middle, the clinging toextremes operates too, just as even an infinitesimal particle entails at least a leftside, a right side, and a middle. Its middle part can again be divided into a mid-dle, left, and right, and so on. As The SÒtra of the Meditative Concentration of theDirect Presence of All Present Buddhasstates, both middle and extremes are seem-ing and not ultimate:Not observing, not conceptualizing, and not establishing the twoextremes, not mentally engaging, and not being occupied with themis what is taught in a nominal way and through the worldly seeming.Therefore, it is called “the middle way.” However, ultimately, neitherextremes nor middle can be observed here.The sÒtra continues by saying that followers of the great vehicle should also notcling to wisdom:A bodhisattva mah›sattva should wish for wisdom but not cling towisdom.N›g›rjuna’s Fundamental Versessays that as long as one entertains referencepoints, such as existence, nonexistence, or a middle in between, Buddhahood isout of reach.The four possibilities of permanent, impermanent, and so on,Where should they be in this peace?The four possibilities of finite, infinite, and so on,Where should they be in this peace?Those who entertain discursiveness with regard to the Buddha,Who is beyond discursiveness and inexhaustible,As a consequence of being affected by all this discursiveness,They will not see the Thus-Gone One.1045450The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 450"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"In the same vein, Pawo Rinpoche ridicules some people’s claim of resting in anonconceptual way within the state of both knowing that the adventitious stainsdo not exist and knowing that the ultimate exists. He says that it is truly amaz-ing to rest in a nonconceptual way within a state in which there is clinging to thenonexistence of stains and clinging to the existence of the ultimate.Also, there is no separate “kingdom of wisdom” or “kingdom of consciousness.”What is the nature of the Thus-Gone OneIs the nature of beings.The Thus-Gone One is without natureAnd all beings are without nature.1046If there were a single, ultimately existing nature of all phenomena, it would fol-low that these phenomena could not have different characteristics. Moreover, ifan ultimate emptiness were definitely established, this emptiness would not be themeans to vanquish reification but rather something to be vanquished itself.Some people claim, “The other-empty ultimate is an existent beyond exis-tence and nonexistence.” However, in a way, this is just a play on words. For whatwould be wrong then in claiming a nonexistent that is beyond existence andnonexistence? And how would one then refute the claim of a nonexistent that iseven beyond such an existent beyond existence and nonexistence? As is obviousfrom this, there would moreover follow an infinite regress, starting with an exis-tent beyond an existent beyond existence and nonexistence. Therefore, PawoRinpoche says, it is problematic to introduce conventions, such as other-empti-ness, that are not known in the Buddha’s teachings and proclaim them to be theheart of his teachings.Then there are those who talk in a one-sided way in terms of Mere Mental-ism and say that the other-dependent nature empty of the imaginary nature is theperfect nature. This is just something that is set up by their own minds, withoutan understanding of the true intention of the lineage of vast activity. For, fol-lowing The SÒtra That Unravels the Intention, the lineage of vast activity explainsthat the imaginary nature is like being affected by the disease of blurred vision;the other-dependent nature is like the manifestations that appear due to blurredvision; and the perfect nature is like the natural object of clear vision upon beingcured. This means that once the disease of blurred vision has been cured, theappearance of floating hairs vanishes. Likewise, when the fundamental disease ofthe most subtle level of the imaginary nature—mind’s nature or the expanse ofdharmas being blurred by the dualistic split into subject and object—is eradi-cated, then the seeming appearances of the other-dependent nature will vanish.At that point, the more coarse levels of the imaginary nature—which come aboutthrough focusing on the appearances of the other-dependent nature and labelingIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 451Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 451"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"them—automatically do not remain either. What remains is the perfect nature,the expanse of dharmas as it is, seen by the unimpeded, natural vision of per-sonally experienced wisdom.1047Furthermore, notions such as existence and nonexistence belong to the imag-inary nature. So, if one claims the ultimate existence of the perfect nature, onein fact claims that the perfect nature is the imaginary nature. This was prophe-sied by the Buddha in The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºka:In the future, those who cling to non-Buddhist thinking will concep-tualize that the wisdom of the noble ones exists as an object of personalexperience and as having the nature of an entity. . . . How could suchnotions operate in the noble ones? If such [notions] were entertained,they would be nothing but the clinging to an identity.Then, Pawo Rinpoche quotes a seemingly contrasting passage from The SÒtraof the Great Nirv› ̊a:1048Before, in Vara ̊asi, I taught impermanence, suffering, emptiness, andidentitylessness to those of medium vigor. Now that I turn the wheelof dharma here in KuŸinagara, I teach completely pure permanence,purity, bliss, and identity.He explains that the Buddha taught on the Dharma Body by emphasizing thatit is endowed with the four qualities of permanence, purity, bliss, and identity inorder to counteract mainly the clinging to the extreme of deprecation, such asregarding the Dharma Body as impermanent. In this context, permanence meansthat the completely pure nature of phenomena will never change into somethingimpure. However, this is not a teaching on any kind of reified permanent sub-stance. This sÒtra furthermore says that Buddhahood can be attained if there ismind, just as butter can appear if there is milk. Therefore, all sentient beings aresaid to have Buddha nature. However, in dependence on the capabilities of var-ious disciples, identity may be explained as identitylessness and identitylessnessas identity. Just as blind people do not see visible forms, sentient beings do notsee their own nature that is like a powerful vajra. Although yogurt does not existin milk as long it is milk, yogurt may come forth from milk. It is from this pointof view that one says, “Yogurt exists in milk.” Likewise, the teaching that Bud-dha nature exists in sentient beings is given in the same way. As The SÒtraRequested by Brahm›says:O Blessed One, those who seek for nirv› ̊a as an entity do not gobeyond cyclic existence. Why? O Blessed One, “nirv› ̊a” is utter peace452The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 452"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"of all characteristics, the cessation of all mental flux.

O Blessed One, those who seek nirv› ̊a within all phenomenathat are fully in the state of nirv› ̊a, [just like extracting] sesame oilfrom sesame seeds or butter from milk, I declare to be vain forders.1049It is important, when looking at the teachings of the Buddha, to be aware thatthe meanings of certain terms can change according to different contexts. Forexample, “causes” can have two meanings: causes for the arising of something andcauses for something to become clearly manifest. Here, it is taught that the “actualcause” for sentient beings to have Buddha nature is sentient beings’ own mind,while the conditional causes are the six perfections, such as generosity. In othercontexts, it is also explained that confidence, the four immeasurables, or the tenbodhisattva grounds and such are Buddha nature. Thus, it is taught again andagain that all phenomena are undetermined and subject to conditions.The same goes for the term “nonexistence,” since there are six ways in whichit may be used. It can mean total nonexistence, temporary nonexistence, nonex-istence due to insignificant quantity, nonexistence because of not being experi-enced, nonexistence due to the adoption of bad dharmas, and nonexistencebecause of the lack of a counterpart to depend on.“Not being seen” can have eight meanings: not being seen due to being too dis-tant, not being seen due to being too close (such as one’s eyelashes), not beingseen due to ceasing, not being seen due to the seer being upset, not being seenbecause of being too subtle, not being seen due to being obscured, not beingseen due to a lack of quantity (such as a sesame seed in a heap of rice), and notbeing seen due to similarity (such as a lentil in a heap of peas).All of these specifications are used in many places in various ways, but it is clearlysaid that, in terms of the actual heart of the matter, they are not to be imagined asanything whatsoever. Thus, no matter whether it is existence, nonexistence, per-manence, impermanence, or anything else that one doggedly sticks to, such cling-ing always deprecates the ultimate. As The SÒtra of the Great Nirv› ̊adeclares:O son of good family, one might say, “Definitely, Buddha nature existsin all sentient beings,” or one might say, “Definitely, Buddha naturedoes not exist.” No matter what you say, it is a deprecation of the Bud-dha, the dharma, and the spiritual community. O son of good family,therefore, I have taught in the sÒtras that there are two types of peo-ple who deprecate the Buddha, the dharma, and the spiritual com-munity: those who have no trust and a mind full of aversion, and thosewho have trust but do not understand the meaning.Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 453Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 453"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Such sÒtras as the Aºgulim›lıyasÒtra, The Great Drum SÒtra,and others saythat the Heart of the Thus-Gone Ones and Buddhahood are permanent, lasting,and changeless. However, this is in order to eliminate the clinging that the ulti-mate is utter nonexistence. As the Buddha says:O MañjuŸrı, in the world, there are two types of persons who destroythe genuine dharma: those who have strong views about emptinessand those who propound a self. These two destroy the genuine dharmaand turn the genuine dharma upside down.Furthermore, it is generally asserted that the liberation of hearers and solitaryrealizers is the discontinuation of the five aggregates, just like the dying of a flame,and that the welfare of others cannot be promoted through the nirv› ̊a withoutremainder. On the other hand, it is said that complete Buddhahood is adornedwith all positive qualities and entails the feature of continuous and all-encom-passing welfare for others. It is just in order to highlight this difference that theliberation of hearers and solitary realizers is presented as being a nonentity andwithout a self or form, while the liberation of the great vehicle is taught as anentity, a self, and something that has form. However, this is not a teaching thatthe liberation of the great vehicle is something material. Rather, it shows that anemptiness that is merely utter and complete nonexistence cannot possibly be theemptiness of Centrists.

Basedon the meaning of what is said in such texts as The SÒtra of Richly AdornedandThe SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºka, different Yog›c›ras make a number of asser-tions: Buddha nature is the ground consciousness; it is the seeds of purified phe-nomena within the ground consciousness; it is the entity of the perfect nature inthe sense of the other-dependent nature being empty of the imaginary nature; orit is the stainless ninth consciousness.1053On the other hand, Centrists say thatfrom the perspective of analysis or the seeing of the noble ones, all referencepoints, such as existence and nonexistence, have completely vanished. It is in thisway that the suchness of Buddhas and ordinary sentient beings is equality in thesense of natural, complete purity. However, from the mundane perspective of noanalysis, when the presentation of cyclic existence and nirv› ̊a is taught, it isdone by bearing in mind that the disposition to accomplish Buddhahood existsin the continua of sentient beings and that the Body of Perfect Buddhahoodradiates from this disposition in accordance with the disciples to be guided. AsThe Sublime Continuumsays:Since the Body of Perfect Buddhahood radiates,Since suchness is undifferentiable,And since the disposition exists,All beings are always endowed with the Buddha-Heart.10542) As for the specific purpose of teaching Buddha nature as permanent and so on,it is necessary to present it in this way for the sake of gradually guiding certaindisciples who still entertain various levels of reification. As N›g›rjuna’sPreciousGarlandsays:Just as grammarians introduce you [to grammar]By reading the fundamentals of the alphabet,The Buddha teaches his disciplesThe dharma to the degree they can bear.1055firyadeva’s Four Hundred Versesagrees:First, one should explainWhatever is pleasant to specific people.There is no way that someone who is repelledCan be a suitable receptacle for the genuine dharma.1056In particular, The Sublime Continuumsays:Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 455Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 455"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Why did the Victors teach hereThat the Buddha-Heart exists in all sentient beings?They taught this in order to eliminateThe five faults in those in whom they exist.These are faintheartedness, denigrating inferior sentient beings,Clinging to what is not the actual, denying the actual dharma, andexcessive attachment to oneself.10573) In the literal sense of being taught as permanent and such in the sÒtras, thisBuddha nature is not established even conventionally, let alone ultimately, sincethe Buddha himself refuted all of this. In addition, such sÒtras as The SÒtra of theGreat Nirv› ̊a1058say again and again that the qualities of the major and minormarks of a Buddha do not exist in any sentient being. The same sÒtra, The SÒtraof the Lion’s Roar of Queen ⁄rım›l›,1059as well as The Sublime Continuumtogetherwith its commentary by Asaºga and other texts repeatedly state that such per-manence, self, bliss, and complete purity do not exist in the impure phase of sen-tient beings. For example, The Sublime Continuumexplicitly says:Since Buddha wisdom is present in [all] kinds of sentient beings,Since its stainlessness is by nature without duality,And since the Buddha disposition is metaphorically referred1060to [by the name of] its fruition,All sentient beings are said to possess the Buddha-Heart.1061Moreover, if the Buddha-Heart were asserted as a self and an uncreated entity,all Buddhist refutations of the notions of a self as entertained by non-Buddhistswould be pointless.

The former refers to the Madhyamaka system astransmitted by MañjuŸrı to N›g›rjuna, and the latter is the Yog›c›ra system aspresented by Maitreya, Asaºga, and Vasubandhu. Since the overall tradition thatis generally called Yog›c›ra contains a number of different philosophical streamsthat may even overlap among various masters, it is impossible to determine thesingle philosophical system of this school, and even a rough outline is certainlybeyond the scope of this book.1063What follows is a brief sketch of the school, itshistory, and some of its positions.In general, the masters of the Yog›c›ra tradition saw their system as a contin-uation of all the preceding developments in Buddhism (be it in terms of Abhid-harma or Centrism) and not as a radical departure from them or even as a distinctnew school per se.1064They tried to retain what was useful in other traditions ofBuddhism, but in a way that was not ignorant of Centrist warnings against reifi-cations of any kind.1065Thus, Yog›c›ra writings incorporate virtually everythingthat previous Buddhist schools developed, including intricate abhidharmic sys-tems, detailed explications of the many stages on the different paths of the threevehicles, subtle descriptions of the processes in meditation, explorations of mindand its manifestations on the levels of both ignorance and enlightenment, as wellas commentaries on major sÒtras, such as the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras1066and thoserelated to the third turning of the wheel of dharma.1067In addition, such mastersas Dign›ga and Dharmakırti developed an extensive system of epistemology andreasoning.Specifically, Asaºga’s hermeneutic framework of the three natures is not at allput forward to contradict the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasand N›g›rjuna. Rather, itinterprets emptiness within this framework. This is also expressed in AtıŸa’s auto-commentary onThe Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment:The learned in the world say the following: Noble Asaºga’s specificway of explaining the teachings speaks about the meaning ofprajñ›p›ramit› as mere cognizance. At present, this is also what mygurus Suvar ̊advıpa and Ratn›karaŸ›nti think.1068Asaºga’s approach may be seen as a contextualizing comment on the sÒtras andIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 457Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 457"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"as a supplement to N›g›rjuna’s view. Because of N›g›rjuna’s radical decon-structive analysis of all phenomena, including the Buddhist teachings, in Asaºga’stime even many Buddhists misconceived emptiness in a nihilistic way. Thus,Asaºga attempted to redress such tendencies and to give a somewhat more pos-itive explanation of emptiness. In addition, in contrast to the Centrists’ reservein talking about the specifics of seeming reality and the Buddhist path of puri-fying the deluded mind, Asaºga elaborated on the details of this deluded mindand its gradual purification on the path into the undeluded wisdom that seesultimate reality. Thus, he investigated not only the true meaning of the scripturesbut also what experientially happens in the minds of those who study and prac-tice this meaning.As will be shown, there is a danger of misinterpreting Yog›c›ra by focusingonly on its commonly associated key notions such as “mere mind,” “mere cog-nizance,” the three natures, the ground consciousness, and the eight conscious-nesses. As was just said, Yog›c›ra texts deal with many other topics as well, andignoring them tends to cause the above notions to be misunderstood becausethey are taken out of their respective contexts. It is only when taken out of con-text that Yog›c›ra texts may seem to introduce novelties or even to be removedfrom the rest of the Buddhist tradition. Moreover, the key notions of theYog›c›ras were not invented by them but clearly appear in various sÒtras.1069The central point in the Yog›c›ra tradition is that everything that we experi-ence or know, affirm or deny, always happens in our minds. Our impression thatthings, such as matter, exist externally to mind can only occur within this verymind. Thus, the term cittam›tra(mere mind) refers to all of this being our meresubjective experience. Even the realization that ultimately there is no mind can-not but happen within the mind. As The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºkaformulates:Mere mind is in the mind, and no-mind is mind-sprung too.1070Despite reports to the contrary, the vast majority of Yog›c›ra masters werenot led by this fact to the conclusion that this consciousness itself is ultimatelyrealor even the onlyreality. Rather, such terms as “mere mind” and “mere cog-nizance” indicate that both a distinct experiencer and what is experienced aremere projections of our dualistic mind, which thus gets caught in its own web.As Sutton puts it:This, indeed, represents the most important epistemic thesis of theYog›c›ra philosophy, namely that every statement about the world isa metaphoricalstatement, a mere representation of it (Vijñapti-m›tra)which tells us more about our own mind, our own tainted percep-tions, reasoning, and memory of past experiences and habits (v›san›s),458The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 458"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"than about the external Reality as such (Tathat›). Thus, the statement“Mind-only” (Citta-m›tra) is not a prima facie description of the worldand its essence, but a characterization of all ultimate reality statementsaboutthe world and their unavoidable limitations.1071Thus, to realize that it is our own mind that projects our subjective world is astep toward liberation from this intricate web. Despite what other people mayclaim, it is more than evident from the Yog›c›ra texts themselves that the term“mere mind” and its equivalents mean neither that the mind alone exists nor thatit really exists. Clearly, in the Yog›c›ra system, the dualistic, projecting mind is theproblem and not the solution.1072Very similar to Centrism, this system thus focuseson overcoming our fundamental cognitive problem (here called “mere cognizance”or “mere mind”) with regard to true reality, which is the basic concern of all Bud-dhist soteriology. Whatever the Buddhist system, the process of overcoming ourown basic ignorance cannot but take place within our own mind. As the nameYog›c›ra (“practicing meditation”) indicates, this school is concerned first andforemost with the mind (its nature, development, and functions on both thedeluded and enlightened planes), since it regards the mind as being both the mainactor and the stage in the process of meditation. Thus, the path of Yog›c›ra isexplicitly described in terms of a gradual progression from mistaken and thusimpure states of mind to the unmistaken, pure wisdom that realizes true reality.In the Yog›c›ra system’s own terminology, the meditator proceeds from “meremind” to “the nonduality of apprehender and apprehended” and finally to “non-conceptual wisdom,” which is the experiential or “subjective” pole of ultimatereality and inseparable from its “objective” pole, which is the expanse of dharmas.In Centrism, this experiential side of the path is mostly not explicitly stated, butit is implied as the realization that takes place in the mind when Centrist rea-sonings are used within the framework of the two realities to eliminate this mind’smistaken reference points. In Western terms, one could say that Centrismaddresses the issue of overcoming our basic ignorance and clinging through afundamental critique of any realistic epistemology or ontology by way of dialec-tic reasoning. On the other hand, Yog›c›ra describes the same process from amore psychological and introspective point of view by mainly using terminology,such as the three natures, that is derived from meditative states and insights.Lindtner summarizes the differing approaches of Centrism and Yog›c›ra to thesame end:Granting that the common ultimate goal of Mah›y›na (i.e., Madhya-maka as well as Yog›c›ra) is to achieve nirvikalpasam›dhi[noncon-ceptual meditative concentration], or advayajñ›na[non-dual wisdom]etc., the decisive and fundamental point of dissension remains.

This . . . is, in all its ramification, what the debate betweenMadhyamaka and Yog›c›ra is all about.1073Asaºga is usually regarded as the founder of the Yog›c›ra system. Significantly,it is said that he felt he did not understand the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtraswell enoughand thus supplicated Maitreya, who then taught him “the five dharma works ofMaitreya,” starting with The Ornament of Clear Realization, which is the com-mentary on the hidden meaning of the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras.1074Later, Asaºgais said to have converted his half-brother Vasubandhu to the teachings of thegreat vehicle, upon which the latter also first focused on studying and com-menting on the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras. (It was only subsequently that he com-posed his “typical” Yog›c›ra works.) That these are not just ephemeral, historicalfeatures of the origin of the Yog›c›ra school is reflected in the fact that this schoolis—not exclusively, but very clearly—grounded in the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras.After Vasubandhu, different currents of thought and interpretation developedwithin the Yog›c›ra school.1075Thus, as a very rough outline, one may distinguish three main streams:1) the distinct system of Maitreya, Asaºga, and Vasubandhu (the lineage of vastactivity)2) a later, in parts more “idealistic” Yog›c›ra, as exemplified by Dharmap›la10763) an epistemologically oriented tradition, headed by Dign›ga and Dharma -kırti1077T The System of the Lineage of Vast ActivityThe objective of this section is to provide evidence for three major points:1) The lineage of vast activity is not some kind of idealism.2) It is not what Tibetans call Mere Mentalism.3) Its final intention is the same as that of Centrism.As for the scriptural sources of the lineage of vast activity, in his commentaryon The Ornament of Clear Realization, the Eighth Karmapa lists “the twentydharma texts that are connected to Maitreya.”1078With respect to the five maintexts—the dharma works of Maitreya himself—in Tibet there is just about everypossible interpretation in terms of which of them belong to Mere Mentalism,Autonomism, Consequentialism, Yog›c›ra, or the Centrism of other-emptiness.460The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 460"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"What is clear is that, in terms of their contents, these five texts cover the entirerange of the Buddha’s teachings. The Eighth Karmapa reports the position of hismain teacher, the First Sangye Nyenba Rinpoche:All these five dharma works by Maitreya are established as commen-taries on the intentions of the entirety of the words of the Buddha inthe causal and fruitional great vehicle. The reasons are as follows: Asfor the middle three treatises, it is not the case that they do not teachthe way of dharma of Centrism in an ancillary way. However, theirexplicit teaching is the distinct system of Yog›c›ra.1079The first dharmawork of Maitreya is a common treatise of Centrism and Yog›c›ra. Thelast dharma work of Maitreya is a common treatise of sÒtra andtantra.1080In terms of the practical application of these teachings, The Treasury of Knowl-edgesays that, in terms of the two types of disciples (common and uncommonones), the first three texts stand for cutting through reference points by way ofhearing and reflecting, while the last two are the way to explain complete certaintyabout the ultimate through meditation.As for the transmission of these five dharma works by Maitreya, The Treasuryof Knowledgestates that their general philosophical system was explained in detailthrough many excellent teaching traditions, such as those of Dign›ga and Sthira-mati. The uncommon philosophical system of these texts was sustained in such away that the most supreme disciples transmitted it orally. This meant that the firstthree texts of Maitreya were widely taught in India, while The Distinction betweenPhenomena and Their Natureand The Sublime Continuumwere not commonlyavailable and are only rarely mentioned in other—mostly late—Indian treatises.After these latter two texts were eventually lost, the mah›siddha Maitrıpa redis-covered them inside an old stupa and received direct instructions from Maitreya.He then passed on all five works to Pa ̊ ̃ita finandakırti and others. The lattertransmitted them to the great Kashmiri Pa ̊ ̃ita Sajjana in the eleventh century.From Sajjana, two main lines of transmission into Tibet started.1081First, thetwo translators Zu Gaway Dorje (eleventh century)1082and Dsen Kawoche1083(born 1021) studied with this master and translated Maitreya’s works.1084Thetranslation and transmission of The Sublime Continuumand the other texts ofMaitreya (particularly The Dharmadharmat›vibh›ga) through these two transla-tors is called “the meditative tradition of the dharma works of Maitreya.” Theother line of transmission and translation of these texts by Ngog Lots›wa—whoalso studied with Sajjana and Dsen Kawoche—is called “the tradition of hearingand reflection.”1085In Tibet, the two translators Zu and Dsen orally passed on the first transmis-Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 461Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 461"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"sion. Among many others, Dsen taught it to Changrawa,1086and the latter toTarma Dsöndrü1087of Chog Dodebu,1088who composed an extensive commen-tary on The Ornament of SÒtras. Then, the great eleventh-century siddha YumowaMikyö Dorje1089and others brought parts of this system into a written form forthe first time.1090Apparently, Dölpopa Sherab Gyaltsen was the first to use theterms “other-empty” and “self-empty” and widely propagated this system.1091Sowhat had been known in Tibet by such names as “the meditative tradition of thedharma works of Maitreya,” “False Aspectarian Centrism,”1092and “profoundluminous Centrism”1093was from then on increasingly referred to as “the systemof other-emptiness” and eventually as “other-empty Centrism.” There were manyother masters who greatly elucidated the uncommon essential points of this sys-tem, such as the Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje, ⁄›kya Chogden1094(1428–1507),T›ran›tha1095(1575–1635), the Seventh Karmapa Chötra Gyamtso, the BhutanesePanchen ⁄›kya Rinchen, Katog Rigdzin Tsewang Norbu1096(1698–1755), theEighth Situpa Chökyi Jungnay (1699–1774), Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo1097(1820–1892), and Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye. Mipham Rinpoche (1846–1912)himself claimed to be a Consequentialist, but he also wrote on other-emptiness,which led to a number of different opinions as to his position.1098Prominentrecent masters of this tradition include Kalu Rinpoche (1905–1989), DüdjomRinpoche (1904–1987), and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche (1910–1991).The tradition of other-emptiness is far from a monolithic doctrine. For exam-ple, there are great differences between Dölpopa and most of the later propo-nents, who also have varying views on certain aspects of the teachings.1099A majordistinction within the system of other-emptiness is into “the other-emptiness ofluminosity”1100and “the other-emptiness of the expanse.”1101The first one meansthat the wisdom of Buddha nature is empty of adventitious stains (the “other”)and that this wisdom itself is not empty but really existent as the ultimate natureof luminosity. Thus, the luminous nature of mind and its innate Buddha quali-ties are emphasized. Typical proponents are Dölpopa and his followers. “Theother-emptiness of the expanse” means that Buddha nature’s wisdom itself is freefrom reference points. For example, such is presented by the Eighth Karmapa inhis commentary on The Ornament of Clear Realizationand also in the writingsof the Sixth Shamarpa Chökyi Wangchug. The most common version of other-emptiness that is widely taught nowadays in the Kagyü school is the one byJamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye, which is largely based on T›ran›tha’s presentationand more oriented toward “the other-emptiness of luminosity.”1102A Brief Presentation of the Main Points of the Lineage of Vast ActivityThe following presentation of the major points of the lineage of vast activityrelies mainly on the texts by Maitreya, Asaºga (in particular his Synopsis of the462The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 462"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Great Vehicle), and Vasubandhu.1103The methodological basis for looking at anyphilosophical or religious text is well expressed by Schmithausen:I presuppose that the texts I make use of are to be taken seriously, inthe sense that one has to accept that they mean what they say, andthat what they mean is reasonable within its own terms.1104Having attempted to follow this approach with regard to Centrist texts, Ibelieve that the works of Yog›c›ra in general and the lineage of vast activity inparticular are to be treated in the same way, without looking at them through theeyes of Centrism or any other system extrinsic to them. The Distinction betweenthe Middle and Extremessays:False imagination1105exists.Duality does not exist in it.Emptiness exists within it,And it also exists within this [emptiness].Neither empty nor nonempty—In this way, everything is explained.Because of existence, because of nonexistence, and because of existence,This is the middle way.1106To explain this from the point of view of cutting through reference points, itis said that, on the level of seeming reality, consciousness that appears as variousappearances—that is, mere false imagination—exists. Since the apprehendingpart and the apprehended part that appear within this false imagination aremerely mentally imputed, they are not even existent on the conventional level.Thus, seeming reality is free from the two extremes:1) It is free from the extreme of nonexistence and the extreme of extinctionthrough accepting the mere nominal existence of false imagination on theseeming level.2) It is free from the extreme of permanence and the extreme of existence throughlying beyond all mutually dependent and imputed phenomena, such as anapprehending and an apprehended aspect.As for emptiness free from reference points, it ultimately exists within con-sciousness—that is, within false imagination—as the mode of the true nature ofthis false imagination. When emptiness is thus said to exist, it cannot be over-stressed that this means that it exists as the ultimate modeof being of all phenom -Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 463Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 463"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"ena and not itself as any reified entity. For Yog›c›ras, existence and nonexistenceare not ontological assertions but rather phenomenological descriptions of whatis experienced in the mind. Thus, in the phase of ordinary beings with stains,dualistic consciousness (that which bears the nature of emptiness) exists withinthe nature of phenomena as adventitious stains that are separable. “Adventitious”means that these stains do not really exist and are the factors to be relinquished.Thus, ultimate reality is also free from the two extremes:1) It is beyond the extremes of nonexistence and extinction, because emptinessis ultimately established as undeceiving.2) It is beyond the extremes of existence and permanence, since all phenomenathat consist of the duality of apprehender and apprehended—such as falseimagination—do not really exist.So, the seeming—apprehender and apprehended—is merely something thatemerges as an appearance of mistakenness. Apart from this mere appearance,there is nothing that is established through a nature of its own. Therefore, theseeming is empty of a nature of its own. In terms of the dichotomy of self andothers, it is obviously also empty of what is other than itself, since something thatis established as the nature of something other than itself is not possible amongknowable objects. Therefore, the seeming is empty in all aspects—self andother—and thus not something nonempty. On the other hand, emptiness can besaid to be established from the very beginning through its own nature—the lackof nature—which is always unchanging. It is solely in this way, nominally speak-ing, that it can be said to be not empty of its own nature and always existent. Fur-thermore, it is empty of everything other, that is, the adventitious stains.The three natures—the imaginary, the other-dependent, and the perfectnature1107—are described in The SÒtra That Unravels the Intention:Gu ̊›kara, what is the imaginary characteristic of phenomena? It iswhat is presented as names and symbols in terms of a nature or the par-ticulars of phenomena in order to subsequently designate conventionalterms in accordance with [this]. Gu ̊›kara, what is the other-depend-ent characteristic of phenomena? It is just the dependent originationof phenomena. This is as follows: “Since this exists, this originates.Since this has arisen, that arises. Through the condition of unaware-ness, formations [arise] . . . “ up to “Thus, nothing but this great massof suffering will happen.” Gu ̊›kara, what is the perfect characteristicof phenomena? It is the suchness of phenomena.1108The other-dependent nature is the mere consciousness of false imagination464The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 464"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"that appears as the entities of apprehender and apprehended, because these areappearances under the influence of something other, the latent tendencies ofunawareness. It appears as the outer world with its various beings and objects; asone’s own body; as the sense consciousnesses that perceive these objects and theconceptual consciousness that thinks about them; as the clinging to a personal selfand real phenomena; and as the mental events, such as feelings, that accompanyall these consciousnesses. Thus, false imagination bifurcates experience into seem-ingly real subjects that apprehend seemingly real objects. This split into subjectand object—the imaginary nature—does not exist even on the seeming level,but the mind that brings about this split exists and functions on this level.The imaginary nature is the entire range of what is superimposed by concep-tions as a self and really existent phenomena onto the various apprehended aspectswithin the other-dependent nature. In other words, what appears as one’s ownbody and mind forms the bases for imputing a personal self. All that appears asother beings, outer objects, and the consciousnesses that relate to them providesthe bases for imputing really existent phenomena. This imaginary nature existsonly conventionally as a nominal object for the consciousnesses of ordinary sen-tient beings. It is in no way substantially established, since it does not withstandanalysis. In detail, it consists of the following: • the aspects that appear as conceptual objects, such as the mental image of a form• the connections of names and referents (the notion that a name is the corre-sponding referent and the mistaking of a referent for the corresponding name)• all that is apprehended through mental superimposition, such as outer, inner,middle, end, big, small, good, bad, direction, time, and so on• all nonentities, such as spaceThe perfect nature is emptiness in the sense that what appears as other-depend-ent, false imagination is primordially never established as the imaginary nature.This emptiness is the sphere of nonconceptual wisdom, and its nature is phe-nomenal identitylessness. The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentionsays:Lack of nature, phenomenal identitylessness, suchness, and theobserved object for purification, these are the perfect characteristic.1109Why is this emptiness called “the perfect nature”? It is perfect because it neverchanges into something else, is the supreme among all dharmas, and is theobserved object to be focused on during the process of purifying the mind fromadventitious stains. Due to its quality of never changing into something else, itis also named suchness. Since it is unmistaken, it is called the true end. As it isthe utter peace of all discursiveness, it is signlessness.

Through realizing it, the dharmas of thenoble ones are attained. Thus, it is the expanse of dharmas.Just like the limitless expanse of space, the nature of the expanse of dharmasis of one taste. Therefore, ultimately, there are no divisions in it. However, con-ventionally, the perfect nature may be presented as twofold:1) the emptiness of nonentities2) the emptiness of the nature of nonentitiesThe first is the emptiness in the sense that the other-dependent nature is devoidof any personal and phenomenal identities. This has the nature of a nonim-plicative negation. The second is the emptiness in the sense that this very other-dependent nature is not established as the nature of these two types of identity.This has the nature of an implicative negation and refers to the actual nature ofother-dependent cognition, or what is called “mind’s natural luminosity.”1110Another classification of this nature into two is as follows:1) the unchanging perfect nature1111(suchness)2) the unmistaken perfect nature1112(the wisdom that realizes this suchness)It can also be presented as these two:1) the path of purification2) the observed object of this path1) The path of purification is again divided into two:a) causeb) resulta) The cause of the path of purification is the naturally abiding disposition. Itis constituted by the uncontaminated seeds in the ground consciousness that areprimordially present by the very nature of phenomena. These seeds are the latenttendencies of listening1113to the genuine dharma, the natural outflow1114of theexpanse of dharma. The latent tendencies of listening are the seeds that springfrom listening to and understanding the meaning of the Buddhadharma andthus serve as the cause for the Dharma Body. However, since they abide in themind stream from the very beginning through the nature of phenomena, they aremerely revived through listening; they are not newly created. Asaºga’s Synopsis ofthe Great Vehiclesays:The [supramundane wisdom] originates from the natural outflow of466The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 466"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"the completely pure expanse of dharmas, that is, the latent tendenciesof listening that comprise all seeds.One may say, “What are these latent tendencies of listening? Are theythe very entity of the ground consciousness or are they not? If theywere the very entity of the ground consciousness, how should they besuitable as the seeds of its remedy? And if they are not its entity, thenwhat is the matrix of these seeds of latent tendencies of listening?” Thematrix that is entered by these latent tendencies of listening in depend-ence on the enlightenment of Buddhas is the consciousness of com-plete ripening. [The latent tendencies of listening] enter it in a way ofstaying together with it like milk and water. They are not the groundconsciousness, because they are the very seeds of its remedy. . . The small, medium, and great latent tendencies of listening are to beregarded as seeds of the Dharma Body. Since they are the remedy forthe ground consciousness, they are not of the nature of the groundconsciousness. [In the sense of being a remedy,] they are somethingmundane, but since they are the natural outflow of the supramun-dane, the utterly completely pure expanse of dharmas, they are theseeds of supramundane mind. Although supramundane mind did notoriginate, they are the remedy for entanglement through beingafflicted, the remedy for migration in the unpleasant realms, and theremedy that makes all wrongdoing vanish. They are what is in com-plete concordance with meeting Buddhas and bodhisattvas.Although [these latent tendencies in the minds of] beginner bod-hisattvas are mundane, they should be regarded as constituted by theDharma Body and [those of] the hearers and solitary realizers as con-stituted by the Body of Complete Release.1115These [latent tenden-cies] are not the ground consciousness but are constituted by theDharma Body and the Body of Complete Release. To the extent thatthey gradually shine forth in a small, medium, and great way, to thatsame extent also the consciousness of complete ripening wanes andchanges state too. If it has changed state in all aspects, the conscious-ness of complete ripening becomes devoid of seeds and is also relin-quished in all aspects.One might wonder, “How is it that the ground consciousness, whichabides together with what is not the ground consciousness like water andmilk, can wane in all aspects?” This is like geese1116drinking milk fromIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 467Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 467"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"water. It is similar to the change of state when, being free from mun-dane desire, the latent tendencies of what is not meditative equipoisewane, while the latent tendencies of meditative equipoise increase.1117Thus, Asaºga’s explanation implies that the mere actuality of the nature ofphenomena, suchness or emptiness, is not the naturally abiding disposition.Rather, the naturally abiding disposition is what realizes this actuality: It is theselatent tendencies of listening, the aspect of supreme knowledge that realizes thenature of phenomena (not, however, as a distinct thing different from itself).The reason given is that the latent tendencies of listening render the sets of thesix inner sources1118of individual sentient beings distinct from each other. Thus,the naturally abiding disposition is what is called “the distinct feature of the sixsources.”1119This means that, through the latent tendencies of listening that serveas the cause for the path of the great vehicle, the six inner sources that exist withinthe continuum of that person who has revived these latent tendencies are madedistinct from the inner sources of those sentient beings who have not revivedsuch tendencies. These tendencies are the indicator that the person who isendowed with them has the disposition of the great vehicle. The same goes forthe latent tendencies of listening that serve as the causes for the paths of hearersand solitary realizers respectively.Why are the latent tendencies of listening included in the perfect nature? Asthe above quote from The Synopsis of the Great Vehicleshows, they are neither theimaginary nor the other-dependent nature, since they constitute the remedy foraffliction and so on.b) The results in terms of the path of purification are the actual paths that are anoutcome of the latent tendencies of listening, that is, the paths of the three vehi-cles, such as the thirty-seven dharmas concordant with enlightenment and the sixperfections.2) The observed object of these paths—the genuine dharma—is also included inthe perfect nature. It is not the imaginary nature, since the genuine dharma is thecause for purification. It is also not the other-dependent nature, since this dharmadoes not originate from the seeds of affliction. Rather, the dharma is the result thatis the natural outflow of having realized the completely pure expanse of dharmas.In brief, the other-dependent nature is like the basic materials from which anillusionist creates an illusion. The imaginary nature is like the various mistakenappearances of illusory animals that may appear to the audience due to thesematerials, although there clearly are no such animals in the materials. The per-fect nature is like the space that pervades all of this. It is not a superimpositionlike the imaginary nature; in other words, it is not a superimposition in the sense468The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 468"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"that nonexistents are taken to exist or that existents are taken not to exist. Nordoes the perfect nature originate from other-dependent conditions, which arethe seeds of the latent tendencies for affliction.1120However, the perfect naturecannot be said to be either identical to or different from the other-dependentnature. Therefore, in its nature, the perfect nature is inseparable from the other-dependent nature and is merely mentally imputed as something different, becausethe perfect nature is the nature of phenomena and the other-dependent natureis what bears this nature.As for the division into seeming reality and ultimate reality, the imaginary andthe other-dependent natures are only seemingly established, since they are themistaken mind and the appearances due to this mistakenness. The perfect natureis ultimately established, since it is real as the object of the ultimate supramun-dane wisdom.The seeming may be classified as threefold:1) The imaginary nature is the imaginary seeming.2) The other-dependent nature is the seeming in terms of consciousness.3) The terms that express the perfect nature are the seeming in terms of expression.The ultimate is also threefold:1) Suchness is the ultimate object.2) Nirv› ̊a is the ultimate attainment.3) The path is the ultimate practice.As The Distinction between the Middle and Extremessays:What is imaginary, consciousness,And also expressions are coarse.andObject, attainment, and practiceAre asserted as the three aspects of the ultimate.1121The imaginary and the other-dependent natures are equal in three respects: Theydo not really exist, are appearances of mistakenness, and are something seemingand false. Nevertheless, it is necessary to classify them separately through theircharacteristics. The imaginary does not even exist on the level of the seeming,while the other-dependent exists on the level of the seeming. The perfect does notexist on the level of the seeming, but it exists as the ultimate nature.Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 469Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 469"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Furthermore, the imaginary nature is called “the lack of nature in terms ofcharacteristics”; the other-dependent nature is “the lack of nature in terms ofarising”; and the perfect nature is “the ultimate lack of nature.” Vasubandhu’sThirty Verses says:Based on the three kinds of lack of natureOf the three kinds of nature,It is taught that all phenomenaAre without nature.1122The imaginary nature is like mistakenly apprehending the visual appearancesthat are caused by blurred vision to be floating hairs and such. Since this is noth-ing but names and superimpositions, it does not exist at all. Therefore, the imag-inary nature is “the lack of nature in terms of characteristics.”The other-dependent nature consists of dependently originating appearances,like the plain visual appearances seen by someone with blurred vision. Theseappear in an illusionlike manner but are without any nature of their own and donot really arise. Therefore, the other-dependent nature is “the lack of nature interms of arising.”The ultimate lack of nature of the perfect nature has two aspects. First,although there is no personal identity, the perfect nature is what functions as theremedy for the notion of a personal identity. Just as an illusory ship to cross anillusory ocean, it serves as the means to cross the ocean of cyclic existence to theother shore of nirv› ̊a. This remedial aspect is actually contained within theother-dependent nature, but it is the cause for realizing the ultimate. Therefore,it is included in the category of “the ultimate lack of nature.” The second aspectof the perfect nature is the one from which enlightenment is attained throughactively engaging in it. This aspect is undifferentiable from phenomenal iden-titylessness. Like space, it is omnipresent and not established as anything what-soever. It can be compared to the free space that is the natural object ofunimpaired vision when the eye defect of blurred vision has been cured and onerealizes that what appeared as floating hairs never actually existed anywhere. Thisaspect is “the ultimate lack of nature” per se.The above is how the three natures and the threefold lack of nature are taughtin the sixth and seventh chapter of The SÒtra That Unravels the Intention. There,the Buddha also says:Having this threefold lack of nature in mind—the lack of nature interms of characteristics, the lack of nature in terms of arising, and theultimate lack of nature—I have taught, “All phenomena lack anature.”1123470The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 470"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"On the seeming level, the imaginary is nominally existent and the other-depend-ent is substantially existent. The perfect nature does not exist in any of these twoways, but it exists in a way of being without reference points. Thus, the imagi-nary is also called “the emptiness of the nonexistent,” the other-dependent “theemptiness of the existent,” and the perfect “the ultimate emptiness.” As Maitreyasays in his Ornament of the SÒtras:If one knows the emptiness of the nonexistent,Likewise the emptiness of the existent,And also natural emptiness,Then this is expressed as “knowing emptiness.”1124Therefore, it is asserted in this system that all knowable objects are pervadedby emptiness and the lack of nature. One may wonder, “If the perfect natureexists as something really and ultimately established, does it then exist as some-thing that arises, abides, and ceases; as something that comes and goes, changes,or disappears; as something in space and time; as a unity or a multiplicity?” Noneof these is the case. The kinds of existents just mentioned necessarily do not reallyexist and are just seeming appearances. The perfect nature, however, is not con-nected with any seeming phenomena whatsoever. It is without arising, abiding,and ceasing and also without coming and going. It is neither a unity nor a mul-tiplicity, neither a cause nor a result. The triad of definition, definiendum, andillustrating example is irrelevant to it. It is free from all reference points, such asspace and time. Because of all this, it is said to be naturally permanent. Likewise,it is partless, because it cannot be divided into different pieces. It is omnipresentand all-encompassing, because it is the true nature of all phenomena.The Lineage of Vast Activity Is Not the Same as “Mere Mentalism”Since Tibetan texts so often mention—more or less pejoratively—those calledMere Mentalists or Proponents of Cognizance, we should investigate their pur-ported assertions and positions. Karmapa Mikyö Dorje briefly identifies them asthose within the general Yog›c›ra tradition who interpret the framework of thethree natures in a realistic sense. They are portrayed as asserting that conscious-ness is really and ultimately existent, referring to the other-dependent nature ingeneral and the ground consciousness in particular.1125Mere Mentalists are alsosaid to describe the perfect nature as the really existent other-dependent naturebeing empty of the imaginary nature. Based on the passage in various sÒtras that“the whole universe which consists of the three worlds is mere mind,” anothermajor position that is often ascribed to them is that only mind is real and thateverything in the universe is nothing other than mind and created by it.1126How-ever, as will be shown immediately below, these positions attributed to the MereIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 471Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 471"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Mentalists cannot be ascribed to the lineage of vast activity, since none of themis found in the texts of this lineage and most of them are explicitly rejected.The lineage of vast activity denies any real or ultimate existence of “mere mind”or “mere cognizance.” For example, Asaºga’s Synopsis of Ascertainmentrefutesboth “⁄ramanas and Brahmans who claim some substantially existing mere mind”by using reasoning and scripture.1127Vasubandhu’s Commentary on The Distinc-tion between the Middle and Extremessays:Based on the observation of mere cognizance, the nonobservation of[outer] referents arises. Based on the nonobservation of referents, alsothe nonobservation of mere cognizance arises. Thus, one engages in thecharacteristic of the nonexistence of both apprehender and appre-hended. Therefore, observation is established as the nature of nonob-servation, because if there is no referent to be observed, an observation[of it] it is not suitable. Thus, one should understand observation andnonobservation as being equal.1128Sthiramati’s subcommentary on this text elaborates:Thus, in its nature, observation is nonobservation. . . . [This meansthat] there is no difference between the nonobservation of referentsand the observation as mere cognizance in that [both] do not exist.Thus, they are to be understood as equal. . . . [The latter] is just called“observation,” since an unreal object appears [for it]. However, sincethere is no [actual] referent, nothing is observed by this [“observa-tion”].

In suchobservation, neither is the nature of observation to be eliminated, noris the nature of nonobservation to be established. They are the samein that they are undifferentiable. . . . “So why is [mere] cognition called‘observation’ then?” In its nature, it is nonobservation, but [it is des-ignated] in this way, since an unreal object appears [for it], as this is theconvention in the world and the treatises.1129Maitreya’s Ornament of SÒtrassays:The mind is aware that nothing other than mind exists.Then, it is realized that mind does not exist either.The intelligent ones are aware that both do not existAnd abide in the expanse of dharmas in which these are absent.1130472The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 472"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"Even The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºka, which is so often considered one of theclassic sÒtras of Mere Mentalism in the above sense, declares:Through reliance on mere mind,One does not imagine outer objects.By resting in the observed object of suchness,One should go beyond mere mind too.Going beyond mere mind,One must even go beyond the nonappearance [of apprehender and apprehended].The yogic practitioner who rests in nonappearanceSees the great vehicle.This spontaneously present, peaceful restingIs completely purified through aspiration prayers.Genuine identityless wisdomSees by way of nonappearance.1131The same is clearly stated again and again in other texts of this tradition too,such as Maitreya’sDistinction between Phenomena and Their Nature:Through [outer referents] being observed in this way, they are observed as mere cognizance.Due to observing [them] as mere cognizance,Referents are not observed,And through not observing referents,Mere cognizance is not observed [either].Through not observing this [mere cognizance],One enters into the observation of both being without difference.This nonobservation of a difference between these twoIs nonconceptual wisdom.It is without object and without observing,Since it is characterizedBy nonobservation of all characteristics.1132Vasubandhu’s Instruction on the Three Naturesagrees:Through the observation of [objects] being merely mind,A referent to be known is not observed.Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 473Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 473"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Through not observing a referent to be known,Mind cannot be observed [either].Through not observing both,The expanse of dharmas is observed.1133His Thirty Versessays:When consciousness itselfDoes not observe any observed object,It rests in the actuality of mere consciousness,1134Since there is no apprehender without something apprehended.Being no-mind and nonreferential,It is supramundane wisdom.This is the complete change of stateAnd the relinquishment of the twofold impregnations of negativity.It is the undefiled expanseThat is inconceivable, positive, and constant.It is the blissful Body of ReleaseAnd the Dharma Body of the Great Sage.1135In the gradual process of realizing true reality, the expedient purpose of the stepof describing objects as being “merely mind” or “merely cognition” is to preventthe total denial of seeming reality in which subject and object appear. To start bypresenting just the unqualified nonexistence of mind (the perceiving subject) courtsthe danger of falling into a nihilistic extreme by failing to account for the mereappearance of the interaction between mind and its objects. Such is stated in Sthi-ramati’s Subcommentary on The Distinction between the Middle and Extremes:“[If neither objects nor mind exist,] then why is the nonexistence ofmere cognizance not presented right from the start?” The apprehenderdepends on the apprehended. Consequently, if [it is established that]there is no object to be observed [by the apprehender], one may eas-ily realize [the nonexistence of the apprehender too], since somethingthat has the nature of being [its] observed object has been eliminated.Otherwise, existence would be altogether denied due to the lack ofmutual dependence of apprehender and apprehended.1136This does not differ from what Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrismsays:474The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 474"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"The Buddhas said, “If there are no knowable objects,One easily finds that a knower is excluded.”If knowable objects do not exist, the negation of a knower is established.Therefore, they first negated knowable objects.1137The lineage of vast activity clearly postulates that the actual liberating purposeof “mere mind” lies in going beyond it, that is, transcending duality by pointingbeyond this very mind and entering the middle path of emptiness or suchness.In this, The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºkais followed:The [Buddhas] do not see mere mind.Since there is nothing to be seen [by it], it does not arise.This middle path is what is taughtBy me as well as by others.Arising and nonarisingAs well as entities and nonentities are emptiness.The lack of nature of [all] entitiesIs not to be conceived in terms of such pairs.Through the realization that what is seen is of one’s own mind,Clinging to duality is abandoned.Abandoning means fully understandingAnd not destroying mind’s imagining activity.Through the full understanding that what is seen is of one’s own mind,Mind’s imagining activity ceases to operate.Since mind’s imagining activity ceases to operate,Suchness has become free from mind.1138From all of these sources, it should be very clear that such Yog›c›ra terms as“mere mind,” “mere cognizance,” and “mere consciousness” are used in describ-ing a meditative progression or as provisional antidotes for clinging to externalreferents.1139However, these notions are in no way ontologically or metaphysicallyreified.

Instead, Yog›c›ra oftenexplains the characteristics of the ultimate in a way that is as non-affirming asCentrist descriptions.

Since the seemingcontinua of these seeds are impermanent, the ground consciousness is merely aseeming, impermanent continuum too.

As in Centrism, this wisdomis typically described by Yog›c›ras by merely excluding what it is not. The Dis-tinction between Phenomena and Their Naturesays that nonconceptual wisdomis characterized by the exclusion of five aspects.1157First, as was explained beforeabout the correct notion of mental nonengagement, nonconceptual wisdom isnot just the mere absence of mental engagement. Rather, in the direct seeing ofthe true nature of phenomena, all reference points have vanished for this wisdom.Thus, since there is no reference point for it to engage in anymore, any mentalengagement in reference points naturally subsides. This does not mean, how-ever, that this wisdom lacks wakefulness and one-pointed, sharp mindfulness. Itis also not without knowing, since it directly realizes the nature of phenomena.Second, it is not just a state of being beyond coarse and subtle conceptual analy-sis, since this likewise applies to the upper three meditative concentrations of theform realm. Third, nonconceptual wisdom is not the mere subsiding of allthoughts, for otherwise deep sleep, fainting, being completely drunk, or the med-itative absorption of cessation would also qualify as such wisdom. Fourth, it is notsomething that is by its very nature without thoughts, such as matter. Fifth, it isalso not the state of trying not to think anything, since this is just another sub-tle thought or grasping in itself. The Ornament of SÒtrassays:Just as the heat in [a piece of] ironAnd blurred vision in the eyes vanish,The mind and wisdom of a BuddhaAre not expressed as existent or nonexistent.1158The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentionsays:“O Blessed One, through which perfection do bodhisattvas apprehendthe lack of nature of phenomena?” “AvalokiteŸvara, they apprehend itthrough the perfection of knowledge.” “O Blessed One, if they appre-hend the lack of nature through the perfection of knowledge, why dothey not also apprehend that [phenomena] have a nature?” “Aval-okiteŸvara, I definitely do not say that a nature apprehends the lack ofnature. However, without teaching through letters, one is not able toteach the lack of nature, that which is without letters, or what is to bepersonally experienced. Therefore, I declare that ‘[the perfection ofknowledge] apprehends the lack of nature.’”1159As for the Dharma Body, the tenth chapter of The Synopsis of the Great Vehi-clemakes it very clear that this Dharma Body is not something outside of empti-Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 479Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 479"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"ness. Specifically, it says that it is free from the duality of existence and nonexis-tence (X.3). Asvabh›va’s (450–530) Explanation of The Synopsis of the Great Vehi-cleelaborates:[The phrase] “[The Dharma Body] is characterized by the nondualityof existence and nonexistence” [means that] it does not have the char-acteristic of existence, since all phenomena have the essential charac-ter of the nonexistence of entities. Nor does it have the characteristicof nonexistence, because its nature is emptiness.1160In an insertion into his Chinese translation of Vasubandhu’s commentary,Para m›rtha emphasizes here that all the enlightened bodies of a Buddha must beinterpreted through the understanding of emptiness.1161In both The SublimeContinuum1162and The Ornament of SÒtras,1163the Dharma Body is said to bespacelike and is equated with the completely pure expanse of dharmas as well asthe naturally luminous nature of the mind.The Synopsis of the Great Vehiclecompares the ways of understanding the threenatures:“In this teaching that is the very extensive teaching of the great vehi-cle of the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, how should the imaginary naturebe understood?” It should be understood through the teachings on thesynonyms of nonexistents.“How should the other-dependent nature be understood?” It shouldbe understood to be like an illusion, a mirage, an optical illusion, areflection, an echo, [the reflection of] the moon in water, and a mag-ical creation.“How should the perfect nature be understood?” It should be under-stood through the teachings on the four kinds of completely pure dhar-mas.

One engages in this just like in the case of a rope appearing as asnake in a dark house. Since a snake does not exist, [to see it] in therope is mistaken. Those who realize [that the rope] is its referent haveturned away from the cognition of [seeing] a snake where there isnone and dwell in the cognition of [apprehending] a rope. [How-ever,] when regarded in a subtle way, such is also mistaken, since [aIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 481Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 481"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"rope] consists of [nothing but] the characteristics of color, smell, taste,and what can be touched.

Likewise, based on the cognition of [seeing] the perfectnature, . . . also the cognition of mere cognizance is to be dissolved.. . . Through engaging in mere cognizance, one engages in the other-dependent nature.How does one engage in the perfect nature? One engages in it by dis-solving the notion of mere cognizance too. . . . Therefore, there is noteven an appearance of [phenomena] as mere cognizance. When bod-hisattvas . . . dwell in the expanse of dharmas in an immediate way,what is observed and what observes are equal in these bodhisattvas. Inconsequence, what springs forth [in them] is equal, nonconceptualwisdom. In this way, such bodhisattvas engage in the perfect nature.1166From the point of view that Yog›c›ra presentations are based on the view thateverything is experienced only in our mind, the three natures can be summa-rized in yet another way. The imaginary nature stands for our habitual way ofmisperceiving the other-dependent nature. We insist that dependently originat-ing mere appearances in the mind are real and distinct subjective and objectiveentities, such as inner consciousness and external objects. However, even if suchdualistic appearances have no ground, they still appear and are experienced. Theperfect nature refers to perceiving the unity of dependently originating mereappearances and emptiness. This means realizing that any imaginary subject-object duality and all superimpositions of personal and phenomenal identitiesnever existed in other-dependent appearances. In other words, this is the real-ization of the unity of form and emptiness.Thus, the three natures are not three different ontological “things.” It is notthat by subtracting one (the imaginary nature) from the other (the other-depend-ent nature), one arrives at the third (the perfect nature). Rather, Yog›c›ra talksabout the other-dependent nature as the experiential ground for a dynamicprocess of disillusioning and refining our perception, with the imaginary natureand the perfect nature being the “extremes” of mistaken and pure perceptionrespectively. Thus, the other-dependent nature stands for the continuity of expe-rience, which is impure when imagined as the imaginary nature and pure or per-fected when this imaginary nature has been seen through. Since the realizationof the perfect nature is still an experience and not something abstract or justnothing, it is said that the other-dependent nature in its pure aspect is the per-fect nature. In this way, “other-dependent nature” is just a term for the com-pound meaning of the imaginary nature and the perfect nature, which points to482The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 482"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"the underlying experiential continuity of a mind stream that becomes increasinglyaware of its own true nature.In summary, in the lineage of vast activity, there is clearly no trace of reifyingany of the three natures. Again, this just follows what The SÒtra of the Arrival inLaºkasays:When scrutinized with insight,Neither the imaginary, nor the dependent,Nor the perfect [nature] exists.So how could insight conceive of an entity?1167In his explanation of the four purities that comprise the perfect nature (nat-ural complete purity, unstained complete purity, the complete purity of the path,and the completely pure object), Vasubandhu adds that the first two purities arethe unchanging perfect nature, while the last two are the unmistaken perfectnature.1168Both his and Asvabh›va’s commentary identify natural complete puritywith Buddha nature.1169As for the genuine dharma as the completely pure object,Vasubandhu elaborates on why the teachings of the great vehicle are completelypure and are therefore included in the perfect nature:Thus, whatever dharma arises from the imaginary arises from afflictedcauses. Whatever [dharma] arises as the other-dependent is not true.However, since it is the natural outflow of the pure expanse of dhar-mas, [the completely pure object] is neither of these, is not untrue,and arises from the perfect [nature] itself.1170When the genuine dharma becomes an object of a conceptual consciousnessor is verbally expressed during the initial stages of the path, it is imaginary. Sincethe inner subject of such processes is false imagination—that is, the other-depend-ent nature in its unawareness of the ultimate—the dharma also becomes entan-gled with and thus blurred by the other-dependent nature. Finally, on the levelof nondual, nonconceptual wisdom that directly realizes the expanse of dharmas(the actual, complete purity of the path), there is no more separation or differ-ence between subject and object. This is the culmination of the path as the pas-sage from engagement in the dharma to its clear manifestation as the nature ofone’s entire being: enlightenment. Surely, the immediate experience of theexpanse of dharmas itself is beyond thought and expression, but its natural expres-sion or outflow for the benefit of others is the genuine dharma as it is compas-sionately communicated by those who have this experience. This represents thepassage from enlightenment to communicating the dharma to others, which isclearly expressed in The Prajñ›p›ramit› SÒtra in Eight Thousand Lines:Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 483Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 483"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"When the dharma taught by the Thus-Gone One is taught, the disci-ples reveal and seize the nature of phenomena.

The former experience is thencalled “nondual, nonconceptual wisdom,” while the latter is other-dependentconsciousness.In Yog›c›ra, everything is contained within the expanse of dharmas, or natu-ral complete purity. Although the Yog›c›ra system is expressed within the frame-work of the three natures, the ground consciousness, and such, it is important tokeep in mind that this entire edifice is grounded in and built from within the per-spective of direct insight into the expanse of dharmas. The dharma as well as theensuing path of engaging in it stem from this natural ground, and when thisground is directly realized, then both this dharma and the path merge back intothe expanse of dharmas. As The Ornament of SÒtrassays:It is said that enlightenment is attainedBy those nonconceptual bodhisattvasWho regard all that has been explainedAs mere conception.1172This also points to the relationship between the four purities. The latent ten-dencies of listening as the outflow of “one’s own” expanse of dharmas (naturalpurity) are the remedy for the ground consciousness (the ground of delusion) inthe same mind stream. On the path, it is not that consciousness is an indiscrim-inate blend of both illusion and truth. Rather, within the naturally pure, funda-mental space of the expanse of dharmas, the purity of the path manifests fromengaging in the completely pure object, that is, the genuine dharma as the nat-ural expression of others’ realization of the expanse of dharmas. This path resultsin a radical change of state1173of one’s inner subjectivity; that is, dualistic con-sciousness unaware of the expanse of dharmas is revealed as nondual wisdom and484The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 484"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"expanse inseparable. This is nothing other than unstained complete purity.Vasubandhu’s commentary on The Synopsis of the Great Vehiclesays:Unstained complete purity means that the very same suchness [naturalcomplete purity] becomes Buddhahood. This is characterized as puresuchness in that it is free from the stains of afflictive and cognitiveobscurations.1174As for the statement that the perfect nature is the other-dependent natureempty of the imaginary nature (which is said to be the position of the Mere Men-talists), it is also found in the texts of the lineage of vast activity. However, accord-ing to The Synopsis of the Great Vehicle, its meaning is to be understood as follows:The aspect of affliction refers to the existence of the imaginary nature in theother-dependent nature. The aspect of complete purity refers to the existence ofthe perfect nature in the other-dependent nature. Thus, the other-dependentnature itself is involved in both of these aspects. This is what the Buddha had inmind when he taught the three natures. The analogy for this meaning is gold ore,which may also be said to involve three aspects: stone, gold, and gold ore as theircompound. Before being processed in an oven, gold ore looks like ordinary stone,although it actually is gold. In itself, it is just the compound of stone and gold.After having been processed in a furnace, only the gold is visible and not thestone. Likewise, as long as ordinary consciousness has not been touched by thefire of nonconceptual wisdom, this consciousness appears as the nature of falseimagination, but not as the true reality, which is the perfect nature. Once ordi-nary consciousness has been touched by the fire of nonconceptual wisdom, thisconsciousness appears as the perfect nature and no longer as the nature of falseimagination. Thus, the consciousness that is false imagination—the other-dependent nature—is involved in both aspects, just as gold ore contains bothstone and the gold that exists within it.1175Thus, the other-dependent nature may be considered under two aspects. In itsfirst aspect, it is contaminated by false imagination, with the result that a worldof dualistic appearances is constructed. Appearances are imputed to possess anintrinsic nature of their own, though they do not exist in this way from the ulti-mate point of view. This is why the other-dependent nature in its imaginaryaspect is called the basis for the appearance of all entities. Since we are trappedby such imagination into a false view of things that leads to suffering, the other-dependent nature is said to pertain to suffering. The second aspect of the other-dependent nature is its being uncontaminated by the above processes and beingidentical to the perfect nature. This is said to be the aspect pertaining to purity.In other words, if there is absolutely nothing, not even some illusory, impure, anddualistic mind at the beginning of the path to liberation, then there cannot be anyIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 485Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 485"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"purified, nondual mind as the result of this path. Thus, the mere fact of empti-ness or the expanse of dharmas alone is not enough for enlightenment; there hasto be an experience of it.One of the crucial reasons to propose the other-dependent nature is to accountfor the continuity of a mind stream from impure to pure experiences. In thelineage of vast activity, it is only in this sense that the other-dependent naturebeing empty of the imaginary nature is said to be the perfect nature. These arealso referred to as the pure and the impure other-dependent nature. The Synop-sis of the Great Vehiclesays:In one sense, the other-dependent nature is other-dependent; inanother sense, it is imaginary; and in yet another sense, it is perfect. Inwhat sense is the other-dependent nature called “other-dependent”? Itis other-dependent in that it originates from the seeds of other-depend-ent latent tendencies. In what sense is it called “imaginary”? Becauseit is both the cause of [false] imagination and what is imagined by it.In what sense is it called “perfect”? Because it does not at all exist inthe way it is imagined.1176andThus, in terms of its imaginary aspect, this very other-dependentnature is sa ̇s›ra. In terms of its perfect aspect, it is nirv› ̊a.1177Such statements may also be seen as justifications for the relationship betweenthe three natures as it is usually described by the proponents of other-emptiness:that the perfect nature is empty of both the imaginary and the other-dependentnatures. Vasubandhu’s B ̧ha ̨ ̨ık›(his major commentary on the Prajñ›p›ramit›sÒtras) likewise interprets the three natures in this sense. In any case, due to thedual status of the other-dependent nature (pure and impure) at different stagesof the path, whether it is said that the perfect nature is the other-dependentnature empty of the imaginary nature or that the perfect nature is empty of boththe imaginary and the other-dependent natures, the meaning is the same.As for the notion of Buddha nature, there is no reifying interpretation of it inany of the texts of the lineage of vast activity. The teachings on Buddha natureare not meant as a philosophical or even ontological alternative to emptiness.Buddha nature or the luminous nature of the mind is not seen as a monisticabsolute beside which all other phenomena have an illusionlike status. Rather, itis the undeluded state of mind in which its self-delusion has fully and irreversiblyceased to operate. The main example that is used for it is space. However, inorder to clarify that the insubstantial expanse of the mind is not like mere inert,outer space but that it is the luminous, natural unity of wisdom and expanse, the486The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 486"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"teachings on Buddha nature also give many examples for the luminous aspect ofmind’s nature and its boundless, inseparable qualities.1178Asaºga’s commentaryon The Sublime Continuum’s most famous two verses explains:Those whose minds stray from emptiness are those bodhisattvas whohave newly entered the [great] vehicle. They deviate from the princi-ple of what emptiness means in terms of the Heart of the Thus-GoneOnes. [Among them,] there are those who assert the door to liberationthat is emptiness due to the destruction of [real] entities, saying, “Thesubsequent extinction and destruction of an existing phenomenon isperfect nirv› ̊a.” Or, there are also those who rely on emptiness bymentally focusing on emptiness [as some real entity], saying, “In a waythat is distinct from form and so on, what is called ‘emptiness’ existsas some entity which is to be realized and meditated on.” So, how isthe principle of what emptiness means in terms of the Heart of theThus-Gone Ones expressed here?There is nothing to be removed from itAnd not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is to be seen as it really is—Who sees actual reality is released.The basic element is empty of what is adventitious,Which has the characteristic of being separable.It is not empty of the unsurpassable dharmas,Which have the characteristic of being inseparable.1179What is elucidated by this? There is nothing to be removed from thisbasic element of the Thus-Gone Ones that is naturally completelypure, since the emptiness of [all] expressions of afflicted phenomena(the adventitious stains) is its nature. Nor is the slightest to be addedto it, since the expressions of purified phenomena (the fact of insepa-rable dharmas) are its nature. Hence, it is said [in The SÒtra of theLion’s Roar of Queen ⁄rım›l›] that the Heart of the Thus-Gone Onesis empty of all the cocoons of afflictions, which are separable [from it]and realized as being relinquished. It is not empty of the inconceivableBuddhadharmas, which are inseparable [from it], realized as not beingrelinquished, and greater in number than the sands of the river Gaºg›.Thus, one clearly sees that when something does not exist somewhere,the [latter] is empty of that [former]. In accordance with reality, oneunderstands that what remains there always exists.1180These two versesIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 487Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 487"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"unmistakenly elucidate the defining characteristic of emptiness, sinceit [thus] is free from the extremes of superimposition and denial.

Some scholars say that the teach-ings on the existence of Buddha nature in all sentient beings have to be inter-preted as merely an expedient meaning, since they—according to the aboveverses—only serve to eliminate these five flaws. The Karmapa counters this argu-ment in good Consequentialist manner by drawing absurd consequences from it.He says that if these teachings were only of expedient meaning, there would beno need to give up these five flaws. This means that there would be no flaw inlooking down on inferior beings, because beings do not really have Buddhanature. Consequently, there is no reason to believe that such beings have Bud-dha nature’s enlightened qualities. There would also be no flaw in denying thepossibility of enlightenment, since the nonexistence of Buddha nature means the488The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 488"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"nonexistence of the Dharma Body. When rejecting enlightenment, one wouldnot fall into the extreme of false denial, since Buddha nature as its very groundnever existed. Rather, one would express just the true way things are. Thus, itwould also be fine to be fainthearted and lack confidence in ever attaining enlight-enment, since Buddha nature does not indeed exist in one’s own mind stream.Hence, to have self-confidence in it being one’s true nature would be an attitudethat does not at all correspond to the facts.The Karmapa does not explicitly mention this, but following his same line ofargument for the remaining two flaws, people would be fully entitled to be proudand self-satisfied when achieving any new qualities. Since there would be noth-ing behind the delusions and obscurations that manifest as cyclic existence, itwould be justified to take these deluded states as the only reality. Consequently,any attempt at practicing the Buddhist path would be pointless. Moreover, ifthe teachings on Buddha nature are understood as an expedient meaning, that is,as mere skillful means to address some specific flaws, it would follow that allother teachings of the Buddha as well, including those on emptiness, are of expe-dient meaning, since it is common to all teachings of the Buddha that they weregiven for specific purposes and as remedies for specific problems. Thus, therewould be nothing of definitive meaning in the Buddha’s teachings.The above absurd consequences by the Karmapa in no way imply that heaffirms any reified existence of Buddha nature. This is very clearly described inhis commentary on The Ornament of Clear Realization:In this context, in order to know exactly what the mode of the supremevehicle is, one must know what is the true reality, the nature of phe-nomena. In the mantra vehicle, this is explained as being the princi-pal of the divisions of all dispositions, the lord of the circle of theultimate mandala, and the remaining, irremovable continuum of allaspects of ground, path, and fruition in which the three poisons arerelinquished and whose own nature is not impermanent. This actualmode of being is declared as “the Heart of the Thus-Gone Ones” byvenerable Maitreya. His intention was that this Heart is the DharmaBody endowed with twofold purity and that, by labeling a part withthe name of the whole, sentient beings have one dimension, that is,“natural purity,” of the Buddha-Heart endowed with twofold purity.In this way, he spoke of “sentient beings who have the disposition ofthe Buddhas.” . . .In his Autocommentary on The Profound Inner Reality,1184[the ThirdKarmapa Rangjung Dorje] . . . explains that those who possess impuremental impulses are sentient beings and thereby elucidates that theIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 489Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 489"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"expanse of dharmas does not exist in such sentient beings. He presentsthese very sentient beings as beingthe adventitious stains, that is, whatis produced by false imagination which deviates from the expanse ofdharmas. By giving the pure mind names such as “ordinary mind,”“original protector,” and “original Buddha,” he says that exactly this[mind] is what involves the mode of being inseparable from the Bud-dha qualities.1185This kind of [pure mind] is also the [Buddha-]Heartthat actually fulfills this function.At this point one might ask, “What does this pure mind refer to?” Itis “the luminous nature of the mind.” The meaning of “luminous” isthat the [deluded] mind that has deviated [from its nature] is [never-theless] naturally pure. It is said that such a naturally pure Heart existsin sentient beings, [but] that is also not meant literally. Rather, by tak-ing the naturally luminous Heart as the basis, [the fact] that impuresentient beings exist in itas that which is to be purified is stated [as]“Buddha exists in sentient beings.” Yet, it is likewise [only] under theinfluence of other-dependent mistakenness that sentient beings exist aswhat is to be purified, whereas, according to the definitive meaning,the adventitious stains which are to be purified do not exist right fromthe start.1186Thus, the teachings on Buddha nature do not mean that there is some nucleusof Buddhahood enclosed in sentient beings behind the obscuring adventitiousstains. Rather, our whole existence as sentient beings is in itself the sum of adven-titious stains that float like clouds in the infinite, bright sky of Buddha nature,the luminous, open expanse of our mind that has no limits or boundaries. Oncethese clouds dissolve from the warm rays of the sun of wisdom shining in thisspace, nothing within sentient beings has been freed or developed, but there is justthis radiant expanse without any reference points of cloudlike sentient beings orcloud-free Buddhas.In brief, not only is there no statement in the texts of Maitreya, Asaºga, andVasubandhu that mind, the ground consciousness, any of the three natures, oreven Buddha nature is really or ultimately existent, but this is precisely what isexplicitly and repeatedly denied. This is also expressed in The SÒtra of the Arrivalin Laºka:Having thoroughly meditated on all phenomena being free from mind,mental cognition, consciousness, the five dharmas, and the [three]natures, Mah›mati, a bodhisattva mah›sattva is skilled in phenomenalidentitylessness.1187490The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 490"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"Most modern scholars who do not base their writings and research on Gelugpapresentations alone also agree that the essential purport of the system of Maitreya,Asaºga, and Vasubandhu is not at all idealistic and that there is no claim of areally existing mind or other such entities. In fact, in much the same way as theCentrists, Yog›c›ras like Asaºga and Vasubandhu introduce and employ expe-dient concepts, such as “mere mind,” only for the sake of dissolving previousones. Once these concepts on different levels have fulfilled their purpose ofredressing specific misconceptions, they are replaced by more subtle ones, whichare similarly removed later in the gradual process of letting go of all referencepoints.The outcome of the above presentation is that the refutations in the Centristtexts of Mere Mentalism in general and of a really existing self-awareness orground consciousness and so on in particular cannot be directed against the sys-tem of these masters. I have gone to some length here to provide evidence for thisfor two main reasons. First, it is quite an important point that Centrism and thelineage of vast activity are not mutually exclusive. Second is the need to redressthe common but mistaken conflation of the lineage of vast activity with whatTibetans call Mere Mentalism, which invariably leads to its rejection.Who Were the Mere Mentalists?The question whether any actual Indian proponents of what Tibetans call “MereMentalism” ever existed and who these might have been is difficult to answer.Any conclusive evaluation must depend on a precise comparison of the relevantIndian sources that are still available with what is understood by the later Tibetancategory “Mere Mentalism,” but such a process has hardly started yet. Moreover,the term and scope of “Mere Mentalism” is understood in various ways in dif-ferent Tibetan doxographies, often with no clear distinction as to what the namesYog›c›ra, Proponents of Cognizance, and Mere Mentalists refer to (sometimesthey are taken as equivalents and at other times not).Both T›ran›tha’s History of Buddhism in India1188and The Treasury of Knowl-edge1189speak about the first five hundred masters of the great vehicle, such as Avi-tarka, *Vigat›radvaja, Divy›karagupta, R›hulamitra, *Jñ›natala, and *Saºgatala(all c. first century ce). T›ran›tha calls them and their followers “Yog›c›ra MereMentalists”1190and The Treasury of Knowledgesays that they are known as “Pro-ponents of Cognizance.” In the same context, both texts also mention two con-temporaries of these teachers, the brothers Udbha ̨asiddhisv›min and⁄a ̇karapati.

Amongthese, Nanda, *Paramasena, and *Sa ̇yaksatya are mentioned by name and saidto be “the early Yog›c›ras.” Except for three devotional praises byUdbha ̨asiddhisv›min and ⁄a ̇karapati in the Tengyur, no works of any of theseIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 491Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 491"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"masters have survived, so it is impossible to determine their views. Later, TheTreasury of Knowledgeexplicitly clarifies that Maitreya, Asaºga, and Vasubandhuare not “Mere Mentalists” and identifies the above five hundred masters, someof their followers, and also some later (unidentified) Proponents of Cognizanceas the teachers of the system of “Mere Mentalism.”1191Among later IndianYog›c›ra masters, the main one who may be said to exhibit some more “idealis-tic” and realistic tendencies in his works—such as claiming a really existent other-dependent nature—was Dharmap›la (530-561). He also carried this flavor over toterms that were not interpreted in this way by, for example, Vasubandhu andSthiramati.1192In Indian Centrist texts, there is only limited information about individualYog›c›ra opponents and their specific positions. There is no scriptural evidencefor any conflicts between Yog›c›ras and Centrists before the time of Bh›vaviveka.To the contrary, as mentioned above, Asaºga and others even wrote commen-taries on N›g›rjuna’sFundamental Verses.Bh›vaviveka’s critique of Yog›c›ra starts in The Lamp of Knowledge,his com-mentary on The Fundamental Verses. In the first chapter of this text, he criticizesGu ̊amati’s commentary on The Fundamental Verses. In the twenty-fifth chap-ter, he attacks the view of the three natures, especially that the other-dependentnature is really existent (a position held by Gu ̊amati and Dharmap›la).1193 Here,he quotes seven verses from Maitreya’s Distinction between the Middle andExtremesand once from Asaºga’s commentary on The Fundamental Verses. Atsome point, he seems to refer to Sthiramati too. The same topic is also brieflytreated in the fourth chapter of his later Jewel Lamp of Centrism, which mainlyelaborates on refuting both Real Aspectarians and False Aspectarians. In this con-text, he quotes from Vasubandhu’s Twenty Verses. He also attacks the notion ofself-awareness and what he perceives as inconsistencies in Dign›ga’s Compendiumof Valid Cognition.The Yog›c›ra reaction to Bh›vaviveka’s Lamp of Knowledgecame from hiscontemporaries, primarily Gu ̊amati’s student Sthiramati (in his commentaryon N›g›rjuna’sFundamental Verses) and Dharmap›la (in the tenth chapter of hiscommentary on firyadeva’s Four Hundred Verses on the Yogic Practice of Bod-hisattvas).1194Bh›vaviveka’s detailed response to these two Yog›c›ras is found inhis Heart of Centrismand its autocommentary Blaze of Reasoning(fifth chap-ter).1195In these texts, he attacks realistic notions of the three natures, self-aware-ness, the ground consciousness, and some of the arguments for the nonexistenceof external objects.1196Once, he also polemically mentions that “other masters ofthe great vehicle, such as Asaºga and Vasubandhu” claim to be the only oneswho teach how to engage well in the nectar of true reality, while Centrists fail todo so.1197However, the only clearly identifiable Yog›c›ra who actually claimedthis was Dharmap›la in his above commentary, while there is no scriptural evi-492The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 492"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"dence that Asaºga or Vasubandhu ever denigrated Centrism in any way. In sum-mary, among all Centrists, Bh›vaviveka is the one who provides the most detailedcritique of reified versions of Yog›c›ra.1198At the same time, his general indebt-edness to Dign›ga in the field of epistemology is complete and evident.T›ran›tha reports that after Bh›vaviveka passed away, some of his disciplescame to debate with the disciples of Sthiramati, objecting to the latter’s com-mentary on N›g›rjuna’sFundamental Verses. He says, “The followers of the doc-trine of naturelessness claim that in this debate the disciples of Bhavya werevictorious. But this debate should be viewed as similar to that between Can-dragomı and Candrakırti.”1199As for Candrakırti, his Lucid Wordsrefers to some passages of Dign›ga’s textsand once to Vasubandhu. However, these references are found in the context ofCandrakırti’s criticism of the fundamentals of their epistemology, which oftenrest on the realistic system and terminology of the SÒtra Followers.1200To be fair,unlike non-Buddhist logicians, Dign›ga does not really claim that valid cognitionor its objects are ultimately real entities. He only assumes an ontology for the pur-pose of outlining the valid means of knowledge as the tools to investigate theultimate nature of phenomena, but he does not enter this investigation himself.Thus, similar to N›g›rjuna, Candrakırti’s main point seems to be that no systemof valid cognition can be established, whether it is founded on an ontology or not.In his Entrance into Centrism, Candrakırti’s general critique of a ground con-sciousness, self-awareness, the other-dependent nature, and specifically charac-terized phenomena may be seen as addressing such masters as Dharmap›la andDign›ga. As for the refutation of an effective potential1201that is said to triggersubsequent cognitions, this is a concept that is mainly found in texts of the SÒtraFollowers, but only rarely in works of Yog›c›ra writers, an exception beingDign›ga’s filambanaparık ̋›.1202In his autocommentary on The Entrance into Cen-trism, Candrakırti identifies such masters as Vasubandhu, Dign›ga, andDharmap›la as having rejected the meaning of dependent origination as taughtby N›g›rjuna.1203Candrakırti never mentions Maitreya, Asaºga, or his own con-temporary Dharmakırti by name, nor does he quote them. A number of sourcesreport that Candrakırti had an ongoing debate with Candragomı, who upheld theview of Maitreya/Asaºga, for seven years, without either one of them being ableto win (Candrakırti is said to have been supported by MañjuŸrı and Candragomıby AvalokiteŸvara).1204Jñ›nagarbha’sDistinction between the Two Realitiessays that even great chari-oteers are ignorant about the two realities, let alone others.1205⁄›ntarak ̋ita’ssubcommentary identifies these as Dharmap›la and his followers.1206This sub-commentary also says that the positions refuted in Jñ›nagarbha’s autocommen-tary on verse 15 are those of Devendrabuddhi1207and Dharmap›la. ⁄›ntarak ̋itaalso refutes the statement by Sthiramati that it is not suitable for the seeming notIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 493Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 493"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"to have any basis.1208After ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, there seems to be no more mention ofDharmap›la by name in Centrist texts. However, despite their synthesis ofYog›c›ra and Centrism, all Yog›c›ra-M›dhyamikas, such as Jñ›nagarbha,⁄›ntarak ̋ita, KamalaŸıla, and Haribhadra, unanimously refute the notion of areally existent consciousness or self-awareness in both the versions of the RealAspectarians and the False Aspectarians, without, however, mentioning specificpersons.1209They also attack Dharmakırti’s presentations of causality (one causeproducing many results, many causes producing one result, and many causesproducing many results). At the same time, on the conventional level, theystrongly rely on his principles of epistemology and reasoning.1210Other later Centrists, such as ⁄›ntideva and his commentators, for the mostpart seem quite unspecific about Yog›c›ra opponents and mainly refute a reallyexistent consciousness and self-awareness.1211In summary, prior to Bh›vaviveka, the Yog›c›ras sought to assimilate ratherthan to oppose Centrism. A particularly striking example of this is Kambala’s(early sixth century) Garland of Light,1212which displays a most remarkable earlysynthesis of Yog›c›ra and Madhyamaka. After Bh›vaviveka’s critique, however,though never rejecting N›g›rjuna and firyadeva, on certain points the laterYog›c›ras seemed to be at odds with the later Centrists,1213mainly accusing eachother of reification or nihilism respectively. However, what often happened inthese controversies was the general problem of one philosophical system attack-ing the other with its own terminology and systemic framework and not on thegrounds of the terminology and the context of that other system. In particular,Bh›vaviveka’s interpretation of Yog›c›ra is a perfect example of an extremely lit-eral reading without considering the meaning in terms of the Yog›c›ra system’sown grounds, instead exclusively treating it on Centrist grounds. Thus, whenabstracted from the obvious polemical elements and out-of-context misinterpre-tations of what the opponents actually meant by certain terms, not much is leftin terms of fundamental differences between the later Centrists and Yog›c›ras,1214which basically boil down to two issues: (1) whether there is an ultimately realmind (no matter whether this is called other-dependent nature, self-awareness,ground consciousness, or nondual wisdom) and (2) whether any epistemology ispossible at all.Thus, except for a few exceptions mainly in Bh›vaviveka’s texts, the actualYog›c›ra opponents in Centrist texts obviously did not come from the earlyYog›c›ra of Maitreya, Asaºga, and Vasubandhu (stream 1) but from the laterdevelopments in the Yog›c›ra tradition. The main opponent was clearlyDharmap›la, followed by Sthiramati (stream 2), Dign›ga, and Dharmakırti(stream 3). They were accused either of claiming a really existent other-depend-ent nature and self-awareness or of setting realistic foundations of epistemology494The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 494"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"and causality.Contrary to rather common Tibetan and Western claims that there were greatrivalries between the two schools of the great vehicle, apart from the specificissues mentioned above, there is no evidence that they considered their systemsas such to be mutually exclusive. Also, when compared to the attention that otherBuddhist and especially non-Buddhist opponents of Centrists receive through-out the latter’s texts, it is obvious that the Yog›c›ras were not at all the mainopponents of the Centrists. Moreover, it cannot be overemphasized that most ofthese disputes between Centrists and Yog›c›ras represent differences in terms ofcontexts of meaning rather than content per se. As Keenan rightly states:Indeed, in the history of Mah›y›na thinking, the most crucial argu-ments occur not over issues within a shared context of meaning, butprecisely over shifts in that context itself.1215In other words, in their own ways, both systems basically attempt to follow theBuddha in addressing the same fundamental problem of clinging to referencepoints or extremes. They just tackle this issue from different angles, with differ-ent terminologies and methods. As Harris says:N›g›rjuna and Asaºga . . . have set themselves the common task ofrendering traditional Buddhist doctrine in such a way that it can beused to tackle particular problems. Furthermore it is pointless catego-rizing them as nihilists or idealists or anything else of the kind.

Rather, such statements are an expedient teaching within theprogressive stages of eliminating all reference points. The Centrists ground theirunderstanding on passages such as this one in The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºka:Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 495Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 495"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Just as a physician prescribes [various] medicinesTo each individual suffering patient,The Buddha also advocates [the teaching of]Mere mind to sentient beings.1218Jñ›nagarbha’s autocommentary on verse 32 of his Distinction between the TwoRealitiessays:This compassionate being,Seeing those who are fettered by their conceptions,Has taught bondage and liberationThrough such specifications as mere mind.The Blessed One, . . . in accordance with their thinking, has eliminatedall reifications without exception through progressively teaching theaggregates, constituents, and sources; mere mind; and the identity-lessness of all phenomena.1219According to N›g›rjuna, specific reasons for the teachings on “mere mind” areto reverse the clinging to the five aggregates as being real entities and to tem-porarily calm some people’s fear of the complete emptiness of all phenomenawithout any reference point.

He says that this does not mean to establishthe nonexistence of external objects.Candrakırti starts his explanation on the meaning of mere mind in a similarway. In his Entrance into CentrismVI.84, he clarifies the passage in The SÒtra ofthe Ten Groundsthat bodhisattvas on the sixth ground realize all three realms tobe mere mind. This was taught in order to realize that the three realms are notcreated by a permanent self or a creator, since these bodhisattvas realize that, onthe seeming level, the active cause for cyclic existence is merely mind. Candrakırtifurther quotes from that sÒtra in his autocommentary:[These bodhisattvas] properly examine dependent origination in itsprogressive order. They think, “It is in such a way that this bare heapof suffering becomes established, without someone who creates thetree of suffering or experiences it.” They reflect in this way, “Throughclinging to a creator, karmas exist, but wherever there is no creator,ultimately, neither can karma be observed.” They further think, “Thus,these three realms are mere mind. All these twelve links of existencethat were taught by the Thus-Gone One in multiple aspects dependon a single mind.”1225He continues by saying that The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºkahas to be under-stood in the same way:Persons, continua, aggregates,Likewise conditions and particles,The primal substance, ÊŸvara, and an agentAre to be thought of as mere mind.1226Verses VI.87–91 of The Entrance into Centrismstate that the teachings on meremind are meant to indicate the primary role of mind in the world on the seem-ing level, but not to establish that it is the only entity that ultimately exists norto negate the existence of material form and such.

However, unlike mind, material form does not act as the agent or cre-ator of karmic actions. So without the mind, conventionally, there would be nokarma and thus no beings in their various situations of life in different realms. Allof this does not mean, of course, that Candrakırti assertsthe existence of mate-rial forms. As he emphasizes so often, to negate one statement (to negate thatmere mind means to deny the existence of material form) does not mean to assertits opposite. All he says is that the teachings on mere mind have a different inten-tion from establishing mind’s sole existence or denying material form. He fur-thermore explicitly states that the five aggregates do not appear for the wisdomthat realizes true reality. In brief, verse VI.92 says:If form does not exist, do not cling to the existence of mind;And if mind exists, do not cling to the nonexistence of form.The Buddha, in the sÒtras of supreme knowledge,Has equally rejected both, while teaching them in the Abhidharma.Whether on the level of no analysis or with analysis, it is never justified thatmind exists whereas form does not exist. Under analysis, when form has beenfound not to exist, mind cannot exist either, because the two are established inmutual dependence. Without analysis, according to common worldly consensus,both are equally said to exist.In verse VI.94, Candrakırti adds that the teachings that the mind appears asall kinds of outer objects should be understood as an expedient denial of outerforms intended for those who are overly attached to material forms. He con-cludes this topic as follows:The Buddhas said, “If there are no knowable objects,One easily finds that a knower is excluded.”If knowable objects do not exist, the negation of a knower is established.Therefore, they first negated knowable objects.1227In his autocommentary, he accepts the step of first negating knowable objectsand then the knower as a help for those who do not immediately see that, just asall other appearances, the mind as their experiencer is empty too:The blessed Buddhas introduce the disciples into the lack of nature ina gradual way. Those who have practiced merit will easily enter into thenature of phenomena. Consequently, [the Buddhas] first talked aboutgenerosity and such, since these are the means to enter into the nature498The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 498"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"of phenomena. Likewise, since the negation of knowable objects is ameans to realize identitylessness, the Blessed Ones have initially onlyspoken about the negation of knowable objects, because those whounderstand the identitylessness of knowable objects will easily enterinto the identitylessness of the knower. [From among] those whounderstand the lack of nature of knowable objects, [some] will real-ize the lack of nature of the knower all by themselves at some point,while [others] will do so at some other point through a little supple-mentary instruction. Therefore, the negation of knowable objects wastaught first.1228Jñ›nagarbha’s autocommentary on verse 30 of his Distinction between the TwoRealitiesexplicitly says that one is not able to deny the appearance of mere mind:Therefore, it is appropriate hereTo negate only such imputations.Denying what is not imputedWill only invalidate oneself.Not only can nobody deny the appearance of mere consciousnesswhose nature is other-dependent and not affected by the flaw of con-ceptions of a body with form and so on, but those who make any such[denial] only invalidate themselves by perception and such.1229As mentioned above, he also regards the teachings on mere mind as an integralpart of the Buddha’s progressive instructions:The Blessed One, . . . in accordance with their thinking, has eliminatedall reifications without exception through progressively teaching theaggregates, constituents, and sources; mere mind; and the identity-lessness of all phenomena.1230Later Centrists who synthesize Yog›c›ra and Madhyamaka, such as⁄›ntarak ̋ita, KamalaŸıla, and Haribhadra, present this gradual approach as thecore of this synthesis. As The Ornament of Centrismsays:Based on mere mind,One should understand that outer entities do not exist.Based on such a mode of being,That [mind] too must be understood as being completely identityless.1231Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 499Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 499"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"KamalaŸıla’s Illumination of Centrismexplains:Thus, those who cannot understand all at once that all phenomenalack a nature, for the time being, gradually engage in the lack of natureof outer objects on the basis of [them being] mere mind.

Most Tibetan schools seem to distinguishbetween the first and third streams of Yog›c›ra, that is, the systems ofMaitreya/Asaºga (stream 1) and Dign›ga and Dharmakırti (stream 3). However,sometimes the third stream is placed outside of the Yog›c›ra system by relatingit to the system of the SÒtra Followers. In addition, later Yog›c›ras, such asDharmap›la (stream 2), are either conflated with the first stream or distinguishedfrom it as Mere Mentalists. In the latter case, the first stream is then called Shen-tong-Madhyamaka.Thus, two main ways of dealing with the various streams within Yog›c›ra canbe distinguished.In the first case, particularly in the Gelugpa school, often streams 1 and 2 arecategorically referred to as Mere Mentalism or Mind Only. Stream 3 is regardedas the basis for both of the Gelugpa doxographical categories of “the SÒtra Fol-lowers Following Reasoning” and “the Mere Mentalists Following Reasoning.”500The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 500"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"Usually, the system of epistemology and reasoning of stream 3 is treated separatelyfrom the doxographic presentations of Yog›c›ra as the distinct curricular topicof valid cognition, which is understood as being based on the system of the SÒtraFollowers. Tsongkhapa’s version of Centrism attempts to incorporate this systeminto Candrakırti’s Consequentialism. By following Tsongkhapa and looking forcertain key terms—such as the three natures and the ground consciousness—inthe scriptures, the Gelugpa school also subsumes certain sÒtras, all texts ofVasubandhu, and all but two texts of Maitreya/Asaºga under the label of MereMentalism. Nevertheless, in an attempt to claim the generally esteemed bod-hisattva Asaºga for the distinct interpretation of Consequentialism in the Gel-ugpa school, it is asserted that, in his final view, Asaºga is a ConsequentialistCentrist. This leads to classifying The Sublime Continuumas a Consequentialisttext and—except for The Ornament of Clear Realization1234—all other texts ofMaitreya and Asaºga as Mere Mentalism. In terms of doxography, all that islabeled Mere Mentalism is considered inferior to Centrism, and the existence ofa Shentong-Madhyamaka is categorically denied in terms of both terminologyand content. Rather, it is said that “Shentong” is nothing but “False AspectarianMere Mentalism.”1235The other common Tibetan classification scheme is to label streams 2 and 3 asMere Mentalism and place them doxographically below Centrism, which is thencalled “the system of self-emptiness” (rangtong). The system of Maitreya, Asaºga,and Vasubandhu is labeled “the Centrism of other-emptiness” (shentong) andcategorized under Centrism. This approach is usually taken by the followers ofShentong-Madhyamaka, such as Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye. Often then, thislatter form of “Centrism” is considered to be superior to the former. In thisapproach too, the system of epistemology and reasoning of stream 3 is usuallytreated separately as the distinct topic of valid cognition.To reiterate, no such divisions existed in India. Some Tibetans, such as MikyöDorje and Pawo Rinpoche, refused to follow either of these later doxographicalapproaches. Rather, they insisted on treating the lineage of profound view and thelineage of vast activity on their own grounds and did not simply equate the latterwith Mere Mentalism. In this, they agreed with other Tibetan masters, such as⁄›kya Chogden and Mipham Rinpoche, as well as with many modern scholars.The Development of the Rangtong-Shentong ControversyWhy did the divisions into Mere Mentalism, self-empty, and other-empty orig-inate and become so widespread in Tibet? Throughout Tibetan dharma history(particularly after the fourteenth century), to a greater or lesser extent, there wasa tendency to neglect the Yog›c›ra tradition as a whole and treat it mainlythrough its refutations in Centrist texts. This tendency started at the outset of thespread of dharma in Tibet, since, in terms of the sÒtra view, all the major IndianIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 501Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 501"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"masters, such as ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, KamalaŸıla, and AtıŸa, who were involved in bring-ing the Buddha’s teaching to Tibet were Centrists. Although the first two mastersincorporated some Yog›c›ra elements in their Yog›c›ra-Madhyamaka synthesis,the transmission of the entire lineage of vast activity was clearly secondary. Aclearly traceable stream was the transmission from Sajjana to Dsen Kawoche andZu Gaway Dorje, which was, however, more or less limited to the five texts byMaitreya/Asaºga. Except for Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Abhidharma(which isnot a Yog›c›ra work anyway) and—to a lesser degree—Asaºga’s Compendium ofAbhidharma, the other works of these two masters, let alone of other Yog›c›ras(such as Sthiramati or Dharmap›la), were usually not studied much in Tibet.The neglect of Yog›c›ra is also reflected in the traditional curriculum of thefive major topics of sÒtra studies as it developed in Tibetan monastic colleges:Vinaya, Abhidharma, Pram› ̊a (Tib. tshad ma; valid cognition), Prajñ›p›ramit›,and Madhyamaka. In the traditional aproaches of presenting this curriculum, theYog›c›ra system or the lineage of vast activity is hardly represented, if at all.Abhidharma is studied solely through Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Abhidharma(which treats the systems of the Followers of the Great Exposition and the SÒtraFollowers). Pram› ̊a is based on the epistemological texts of Dign›ga and Dhar-makırti as being mainly an expression of the system of the SÒtra Followers, with-out much reference, if any, to the Yog›c›ra system. The hidden meaning ofpaths and grounds in the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasis studied through Maitreya’sOrnament of Clear Realization, but this text is commonly considered to presentthe view of Yog›c›ra-Sv›tantrika-Madhyamaka. Finally, Madhyamaka, whichmainly treats emptiness as the explicit meaning of the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras, isusually studied solely through a Consequentialist text, Candrakırti’s Entranceinto Centrism.1236This core curriculum is supplemented by systematic studies of the four Bud-dhist philosophical systems according to Tibetan categorization. It is here that thetwo classification schemes outlined above are treated in detail. These doxo-graphical classifications, in particular the issue of how Mere Mentalism is treatedand whether a Shentong-Madhyamaka is accepted, inform and shape the stud-ies of the core curriculum to a high degree.Dölpopa was one of the first Tibetans to vehemently deny that the lineage ofvast activity is Mere Mentalism. He often called these two streams “ultimate Cit-tam›tra” and “seeming Cittam›tra” respectively. He greatly stressed the unity ofthe lineages of profound view and vast activity and disclaimed that the latter isinferior to Centrism. Instead, he asserted that Indian masters such as N›g›rjuna,Asaºga, Vasubandhu, and Dign›ga all belong to the tradition that he called“Great Madhyamaka.” Dölpopa also elaborated on the correct understanding ofthe framework of the three natures, largely following Vasubandhu’s Prajñ› p›ra -mit› commentaryB ̧ha ̨ ̨ık›. Consequently, he criticized the position that all502The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 502"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"scriptures in which the three natures appear are just Mere Mentalism. As for thedistinction between “self-empty” and “other-empty,” Dölpopa said that seemingreality is self-empty, while ultimate reality—Buddha nature or the nature ofmind—is other-empty, that is, empty of adventitious stains but not empty ofBuddha qualities. It is moreover asserted to be the genuine self, which is perma-nent and pure.1237As Stearns puts it, for many of Dölpopa’s contemporaries as well as later mas-ters, his entire system including the novel use of terminology came as a “hermeneu-tical shock.”1238It was first severely criticized during Dölpopa’s time by parts of theSakya school. Later, Tsongkhapa rejected Dölpopa in all aspects, and this rejec-tion persisted throughout the Gelugpa school. The critiques by the EighthKarmapa and Pawo Rinpoche were explained at the beginning of the chapter.Following the unfortunate but common pattern throughout Tibetan historyof mingling politics, religious patronage, and monastic rivalries, the gradualgrowth of the Gelugpa school’s spiritual influence was coupled with an increasein its political power. This culminated in the Fifth Dalai Lama’s installation asthe supreme ruler of all Tibet and the Tibetan government being run exclusivelyby Gelugpa authorities. Eventually, as a consequence of the total rejection of theview of Dölpopa’s school of Jonang by Tsongkhapa and his followers and theascendance of the Gelugpa school to a kind of state church, all texts by Dölpopaand other Jonangpas were forbidden and their printing blocks sealed and lockedaway. Gradually, all Jonangpa monasteries (as well as a considerable number ofNyingma and Kagyü monasteries) were converted into Gelugpa monasteries, thelast one being T›ran›tha’s monastery in 1650. From 1685 onward, the Jonangpalineage was completely suppressed as an independent school in western and cen-tral Tibet, although its teachings were still practiced in secrecy. The only openlyJonang establishment at that time was the monastery of Dzamthang and its affil-iates in a remote area of Amdo in eastern Tibet.The ensuing revival of the Jonangpa system, however, came about through anumber of prominent masters of the Kagyü and Nyingma lineages in easternTibet. It started with Katog Rigdzin Tsewang Norbu (1698–1755) and his student,the Eighth Situpa Chökyi Jungnay (1699–1774), who promoted and furtherdeveloped these teachings. Apart from the mere doctrinal differences betweenthe predominant Gelugpa school on the one side and the Sakya, Nyingma, andKagyü schools on the other, as a result of the conflicts described above, the Rang-tong-Shentong controversy definitely came to assume a political dimension too.The Shentong view increasingly served as a kind of common “corporate identity”for those schools that were opposed—both doctrinally and politically—to theGelugpas, whose institutional identity naturally lies in the unique system ofTsongkhapa. The sense of a common doctrinal ground was also one of the under-lying forces of the nineteenth-century nonsectarian Rime movement in easternIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 503Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 503"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"Tibet, which included many Sakya, Nyingma, and Kagyü masters.Moreover, since Centrism was universally accepted in Tibet as the highestphilosophical system on the sÒtra level, it was clear that any claim to the superi-ority of a certain view could be made only from within this system. Therefore,for many who rejected Tsongkhapa’s interpretation of Centrism, it seemedmandatory not only to counterbalance his interpretation but in addition to pro-mote the lineage of vast activity by referring to it as “Shentong-Madhyamaka” or“Great Madhyamaka.” Usually, the latter was then claimed as the superior typeof Centrism, while “Mere Mentalism” was declared to be inferior to Centrism ingeneral.Of course, such a Shentong-Madhyamaka or even Great Madhyamaka supe-rior to Candrakırti’s and Tsongkhapa’s Madhyamaka—which is then called“Rangtong” in an often pejorative sense—is fiercely opposed by the Gelugpaschool. It is completely rejected as a continuation of Dölpopa’s censored views,which are even denied to be Buddhist and instead equated with Hindu views ona really existent, permanent ›tman. Another response is to categorize the teach-ings of Shentong-Madhyamaka as Mere Mentalism (usually of the False Aspec-tarian brand). In both cases, it is merely seen as a convenient target for Centristrefutations.Thus, over the centuries, there were many polemics from both sides. A naturalpart of this process was the attempt to claim the most prominent figures of Indianand Tibetan Buddhism for one’s own side in this controversy. For example, thefollowers of Shentong-Madhyamaka claim not only Maitreya, Asaºga, andVasubandhu as their roots, but also many masters such as N›g›rjuna (throughhis Collection of Praises), all the mah›siddhas (such as Saraha and Maitrıpa),Longchen Rabjam, Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, and Mipham Rinpoche.1239Con-versely, the Gelugpas hold that Maitreya and Asaºga are Consequentialists in theirfinal view and usually even claim Rendawa and Sakya Pa ̊ ̃ita as being in accordwith Tsongkhapa’s interpretation of Centrism, which is clearly not the case.1240This controversy was one of the ways in which strong rival group identitiesdeveloped in the four Tibetan schools. Often, this even led to severe criticism oftheir members from within these schools, if they seemed to deviate from the offi-cial party line. Examples can be found in a certain opposition even within theKagyü school to the Eighth Karmapa’s interpretation of Centrism with its rejec-tion of a Shentong-Madhyamaka. Conversely, ⁄›kya Chogden received fiercecriticisms from others in the Sakya school for his sympathies for the other-emptyapproach and his attempts to show the final unity of N›g›rjuna’s and Asaºga’ssystems. In the Gelugpa school, Gendün Chöpel became persona non grata forrefuting Tsongkhapa’s interpretation of Centrism.I think one of the big opportunities in the spread of Buddhism to the Westis that Western students of Buddhism, especially in its Tibetan form, now have504The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 504"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"the chance to take a fresh look at the original Indian and Tibetan sources and toreevaluate the various Indo-Tibetan controversies without immediately gettingcaught up in centuries-long entrenchments of sectarian polemics. Fortunately,some signs of such a development are to be found.What If the Buddha and N›g›rjuna Were Mere Mentalists?As has been shown, to categorically label the lineage of vast activity “Mere Men-talism” with the typical assumed reifications and to regard it as inferior to Cen-trism is in outright contradiction to the Indian sources. Thus, a few words seemappropriate with regard to the treatment of this lineage by Tsongkhapa and hisfollowers.By and large, in the Gelugpa school, the views of Yog›c›ras in general and themasters of the lineage of vast activity in particular are only consulted for the sakeof studying epistemology and logic through the system of Dign›ga and Dhar-makırti as well as for describing some aspects of conventional reality. The viewsof these masters on ultimate reality are either studied only to be refuted or notstudied at all. If there seem to be inconsistencies, the overall context is often notconsidered, but statements are taken in a limited and literal way. Not only withregard to the Yog›c›ra school but in general, the monastic colleges almost exclu-sively use the digests of their own textbooks, largely based on the views ofTsongkhapa and his followers, and hardly ever consult the original Indian sources.Asaºga is traditionally venerated as one of the two supreme system founders in thegreat vehicle along with N›g›rjuna, but this is merely lip service. In reality, he iseither refuted, downgraded, or silenced. In the same vein, Tsongkhapa’s earlywork Ocean of Good Explanations,1241in which he explains the ground conscious-ness and the afflicted mind according to Asaºga, is consequently considered byGelugpa authorities not to represent Tsongkhapas’s “mature view.”The standard Gelugpa claim that certain texts are Mere Mentalism and thusonly of expedient meaning is put forward on the grounds that certain key terms,such as the three natures, mere mind, or the ground consciousness, appear inthese texts. However, this approach does not properly consider how such termsare explained in the Yog›c›ra system itself and what they mean in a variety of con-texts. Consequently, not only the works of Maitreya, Asaºga, and Vasubandhubut also certain sÒtras and even the entire third turning of the wheel of dharmaby the Buddha are classified as teaching Mere Mentalism. This resembles theapproach of a child who is asked to describe an elephant concealed behind a highwall and tries to do so by peeping through a small hole in the wall. Seeing onlythe end of the elephant’s tail, the child exclaims, “An elephant looks like a paint-brush!” Such a “hermeneutic approach” leads to a considerable number of exegeticalconvolutions, inconsistencies, and absurd consequences.

Sim-ilarly The SÒtra on the Ten Groundsmust then be a text of Mere Mentalism, sinceit—just like The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºka—says, “These three realms aremerely mind.” However, since this text is one of the two universally acknowl-edged foundations (along with The Fundamental Verses) of Candrakırti’s Entranceinto Centrism, what light does that throw on Candrakırti’s text itself? If one is onlylooking for certain key terms, many tantras too may well be regarded as teachingMere Mentalism. For the same reason, all texts by Centrists such as ⁄›ntarak ̋itaand KamalaŸıla would belong to that category, as would certain texts byN›g›rjuna . For example, his Twenty Verses on the Great Vehiclesays, “All of thisis mere mind.”1242The Praise to the Inconceivableuses the terminology of the threenatures.1243The Praise to the Expanse of Dharmas employs the typical Yog›c›raterm “complete change of state”1244and even says that Buddha nature is notaffected by the teachings on emptiness.1245If the same narrow approach to determine the content of scriptures merely onthe basis of certain key words is equally applied to the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasandCentrist texts with their relentless negations, it is very easy—as many people didand still do—to wrongly categorize them as plain nihilism, especially when theyare not read in their own context (such as their frequent warnings against nihilismand the careful explanations of what “the lack of nature” means).Out of context, at certain points, Centrist texts seem to assert the fourthextreme of neither existent nor nonexistent that is typically negated. For exam-ple, N›g›rjuna’s Fundamental Versessays:Therefore, it is suitable that nirv› ̊aIs neither an entity nor a nonentity.1246Now consider the following verses:Just as phenomena are not existentAnd just as they appear in various ways,Thus they are neither phenomena nor the nonexistence of phenomena.[The Buddha] taught them as the actuality of nonduality.From certain single perspectives,He taught them as either “nonexistent” or “existent.”506The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 506"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"From both perspectives,He expressed them as “neither existent nor nonexistent.”Since they do not exist as they appear,He talked about their “nonexistence.”Since they appear in such ways,He spoke about their “existence.”Since they do not have any intrinsic character,Since they do not abide as their own entities,And since they do not exist as they are apprehended,He presented them as the lack of nature.As each [of the following] is the basis for the next,Their lack of nature establishes themAs being without arising, without ceasing,Primordial peace, and natural nirv› ̊a.Where do you think these verses come from? As they stand, there is no reasonto assume that they were not written by a Centrist master such as N›g›rjuna,Candrakırti, or ⁄›ntideva. Sorry, wrong guess. They come from Asaºga’s Synop-sis of the Great Vehicle.1247Thus, if certain texts are claimed to be Mere Mental-ism just because they contain a certain terminology, this example—among manyothers— shows that it is very easy to equally claim that all texts that use Centriststyle or terminology, such as “the lack of nature” or “being without arising,” areCentrist texts too. Further examples include many sÒtras of the lesser vehicle(such as the Kacc›yanagottasutta), Maitreya’s Distinction between the Middle andExtremes, and Sthiramati’s commentary on Vasubandhu’s Thirty Verses, whichmay all be considered Centrist texts, because they use terms such as “the middle,”“the middle path,” and “emptiness” and also describe the elimination of varioussets of extremes.The Gelugpa claim that Asaºga in his final view is a Consequentialist—whichis based only on The Sublime Continuumof all texts—is completely unfounded.First of all, as generally accepted, The Sublime Continuumis by Maitreya andnot by Asaºga. Everybody who reads this text cannot but notice the completelydifferent approach in terms of both style and content in comparison to anythingwritten by Consequentialists such as Candrakırti. Likewise, Asaºga’s Expositionof The Sublime Continuumdoes not exhibit any trace of Consequentialism. Thus,the claim that Asaºga is a Consequentialist is based solely on a complete rein-terpretation of the straightforward verses of The Sublime Continuumin typicalGelugpa commentaries, which tortuously force these verses into the frameworkIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 507Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 507"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"of their own version of Consequentialism, thus interpreting Buddha nature assimply being emptiness in the sense of a nonimplicative negation.1248Moreover, if—according to this claim—Buddha nature refers to nothing otherthan the emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation, why would the Buddhahave bothered to elaborate on merely this emptiness through abundant words inmany sÒtras of the third turning of the wheel of dharma, when he had alreadytaught the emptiness of all phenomena at length in the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasofthe second turning? If—as per the Gelugpas—the third turning only teachesMere Mentalism, then it is definitely contradictory that this very turning teachesthe emptiness as found in the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras(that is, also Buddha naturebeing nothing but a nonimplicative negation), which they themselves considerthe definitive meaning. But if the third turning indeed teaches this emptiness,then it must be of definitive meaning too. Furthermore, if Buddha nature isnothing but emptiness in the sense of a nonimplicative negation, how shouldsuch a negation alone serve as the potential or basis for Buddhahood with all itsqualities and enlightened activity? And since such an emptiness is present in allphenomena in an equal way, why couldn’t stones and books become enlight-ened too?If, based on The Sublime Continuum, Asaºga were a Consequentialist, thenMaitreya as its actual author must certainly be one too. However, at the sametime, the Gelugpas claim that Maitreya’s Ornament of Clear Realizationrepre-sents the view of the Yog›c›ra-Sv›tantrika-Madhyamaka. They also say that theremaining texts of Maitreya and Asaºga are the foundation of Mere Mentalism.Even for the Gelugpas themselves, there is no case of any other master in Bud-dhism being claimed as featuring in three different schools. It does not makemuch sense to regard Asaºga as not just one of the followers of Mere Mental-ism but as its very founder and still to say that he actually is a Consequentialist,on the basis of a single text that is not even his. Do we know of any other Con-sequentialist who founded a non-Consequentialist, even non-Madhyamakaschool?Why not equally say then that N›g›rjuna’s final view is Shentong-Madhya-maka (based on his Praise to the Expanse of Dharmas), while he is also the founderof the inferior, provisional Rangtong-Madhyamaka based on his other texts, suchas The Fundamental Verses? In fact, The Praise to the Expanse of Dharmasprovidesa much better basis for someone wanting to interpret it as Shentong-Madhya-maka than The Sublime Continuumdoes for regarding it as a Consequentialisttext. In the same vein, one could very well claim that Tsongkhapa’s final view wasMah›mudr›, since the Gelugpa tradition itself reports him as having givenrestricted talks on Mah›mudr› as well as having said to his early teacher Rendawathat he had uncommon guiding instructions based on the Mah›mudr› explana-tions of the Great Madhyamaka, but it was not yet time to propagate it widely.1249508The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 508"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"Instead, one may say, he just outwardly founded the new lineage of his own par-ticular version of Consequentialism and propagated it widely.Actually, if Maitreya and Asaºga were indeed Consequentialists and thus Cen-trists, then this would in effect serve to support the proponents of other-empti-ness who regard the lineage of Maitreya and Asaºga as Centrism.As for Maitreya’s Ornament of Clear Realization, even today, the whole cur-riculum of the hidden meaning of grounds and paths in the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasin Tibetan monastic colleges is based solely on this text. As for categorizing thistext, either one accepts it as a Yog›c›ra text, which means that the study of thehidden meaning of the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasis based on a work of the Yog›c›rasystem (or even Mere Mentalism)—a position that is, of course, completely unac-ceptable to the Gelugpas—or, as they prefer, one considers this work a Centristtext of the “Yog›c›ra-Sv›tantrika” branch. The latter then leads to the wonder-fully simple and elegant exegetical situation that Maitreya—an actual Conse-quentialist who nevertheless mainly teaches Mere Mentalism—also composedan Autonomist text. Even more amazing, he did so many centuries before anydivision between Autonomists and Consequentialists occurred, let alone onebetween so-called Yog›c›ra-Sv›tantrika and Sautr›ntika-Sv›tantrika.There are further inconsistencies in this Gelugpa position. Like all otherTibetan schools, the Gelugpas accept The Ornament of Clear Realizationas thefinal authority on the hidden meaning of the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras, that is, theprogressive stages of a bodhisattva’s supreme knowledge realizing emptiness. Atthe same time, however, they say that it represents the Autonomist view. Fromthis, it absurdly follows that the hidden meaning of the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasis Autonomism. Moreover, the explicit meaning of the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras—emptiness—is said to be taught in Centrism, which is divided into Autonomismand Consequentialism. Among these, Consequentialism is regarded as provid-ing the supreme presentation of emptiness. The Consequentialists themselves donot give a presentation of the hidden meaning of the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasdif-ferent from the—allegedly—Autonomist explanation in The Ornament of ClearRealization. Therefore, it absurdly follows that the supreme knowledge thatrealizes emptiness corresponds to Autonomism and thus does not concord withwhat it realizes, which is emptiness as understood in Consequentialism, since inthe Gelugpa presentation Autonomism and Consequentialism have many essen-tial differences. For example, Autonomism is claimed to still entail some remain-der of discursiveness and reference points, while Consequentialism is utterfreedom from these. From this, it absurdly follows that the supreme knowledgethat realizes freedom from discursiveness and reference points itself entails dis-cursiveness and reference points. Gelugpas also claim that emptiness is onlypartially understood and realized in Autonomism, since the object of nega-tion—real existence—is not fully negated.

However, if Asaºgareally were a Consequentialist, then both founders of these two systems would beCentrists, the one being only disguised as a Mere Mentalist. So why continue totalk about two founders of two distinct systems? And how could Asaºga be oneof the two “supreme ones” side by side with N›g›rjuna, if the Gelugpas considerall his own works to be “Mere Mentalism” and thus inferior to Centrism? Accord-ing to their understanding of supremacy, it would make much more sense to putCandrakırti or even Bh›vaviveka in Asaºga’s place. At the same time, accordingto several of the Buddha’s prophecies in the sÒtras and tantras, all Tibetan schoolshold that N›g›rjuna and Asaºga were bodhisattvas on the first and third bod-hisattva grounds respectively. Maitreya is even regarded as the highest of all bod-hisattvas who dwell on the tenth ground, being Buddha ⁄›kyamuni’s regent andthe coming fifth Buddha to manifest on earth in this present eon. To dwell onlower or higher bodhisattva grounds is not just a matter of ranking among the“top ten” of bodhisattva celebrities, but the Buddhist teachings contain detaileddescriptions of the exponential increase in wisdom and positive qualities whileprogressing through these grounds. In particular, the full capacity to teach thedharma in a completely perfect way to any kind of audience is only accomplishedon the ninth ground. Within such a framework, it could very well be arguedthen that it makes much better sense to regard the texts by Asaºga and the com-ing Buddha Maitreya as being more authoritative in explaining the final purportof Buddha ⁄›kyamuni’s teachings than the works of N›g›rjuna.Why All the Fuss?In an attempt to step outside of the well-established defense lines in the Rang-tong-Shentong controversy, some fresh air might be provided by looking at thenotions of self-emptiness and other-emptiness from a number of different per-spectives.For example, the Eighth Karmapa, Mipham Rinpoche, and other masters turnthe tables on their Gelugpa opponents by saying that the term “other-emptiness”is equally applicable to how the followers of Tsongkhapa understand emptiness,since they claim that, for example, form is not empty of form but form is emptyof real existence (Tib. bden grub). This means that form is not empty of itself butof something other, that is, real existence. However, the proponents of other-emptiness see a big difference between this kind of other-emptiness and its cor-rect understanding as presented in the Shentong school. The latter is said to be510The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 510"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"the actual “other-emptiness of the nature of phenomena,”1250while Tsongkhapa’sunderstanding of emptiness is called the limited “other-emptiness of what bearsthe nature of phenomena.”1251This one is identified as “the emptiness of one notexisting in an other,” which is regarded by all Tibetan schools as a mistakenemptiness that is to be rejected. As the second chapter of The SÒtra of the Arrivalin Laºkasays:This emptiness of one [not existing in] an other, Mah›mati, is veryinferior, and you should abandon it.1252Perhaps a surprising aspect of the Rangtong-Shentong controversy is that it canbe easily demonstrated that emptiness, Buddha nature, and ultimate reality areboth self-empty and other-empty. In fact, the same applies to all phenomena ingeneral. On the one hand, all phenomena are extensively shown to be empty ofthemselves (a table is empty of being a table). On the other hand, even conven-tionally, all phenomena are empty of something other, since there is no phe-nomenon that exists as something other than itself. Obviously, both ultimatelyand conventionally, a table is empty of everything that is other than this table,such as a chair. In this way, self-empty and other-empty are not at all contradic-tory or mutually exclusive. This stance does not contradict the Centrist teachings,since it is precisely what N›g›rjuna declares in hisSeventy Stanzas on Emptiness:The eye is empty of an intrinsic identity of its own.It is also empty of any other identity.[Visible] form is empty in the same way,And also the remaining sources are alike.1253In light of this, it is very hard to claim N›g›rjuna as an exclusive proponent ofeither self-emptiness or other-emptiness.A related issue is that ultimately all phenomena lack a really existent, intrinsicnature of their own, but at the same time, on the level of mere appearances, indi-vidual phenomena can be clearly distinguished from others. This is expressed inThe SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºka:Mah›mati, the learned should understand the meaning of my state-ment, “All phenomena are identityless.” Mah›mati, identityless entitiesare identitylessness. Just like a horse and an ox [are distinct], all phe-nomena exist as their own entity, but not as an other entity. It is thus,Mah›mati, the entity of an ox is not of the nature of a horse, and theentity of a horse is not of the nature of an ox. [It is in this way that] theyexist and are not nonexistent. These two are not nonexistent in termsIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 511Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 511"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"of their specific characteristics. Rather, these two do exist in terms oftheir specific characteristics. Likewise, Mah›mati, all phenomena arenot nonexistent in terms of their specific characteristics, but do exist [inthis respect]. Thus, naïve, ordinary sentient beings understand them asidentityless by conceptually apprehending them, but not in a noncon-ceptual way. In the same way, all phenomena should be understood asemptiness, lacking arising, and lacking a nature.1254As for Buddha nature, there is no Indian text that describes it as either beingself-empty or other-empty. It is only said that Buddha nature is both empty ofadventitious stains—that is, distinguishable from them—and not empty of itsqualities—that is, indistinguishable from them. The Sublime Continuumdeclares:The basic element is empty of what is adventitious,Which has the characteristic of being separable.It is not empty of the unsurpassable dharmas,Which have the characteristic of being inseparable.1255This is nothing extraordinary either. In a way, it is like saying that a book isempty of, or separable from, the dust that covers it. On the other hand, as longas one refers to a book at all, it is not empty of, or inseparable from, its pagesand letters. Yet this does not necessarily imply that the book or its componentsare reified as ultimately identifiable entities. The same goes for Buddha nature,the Dharma Body, or nonconceptual wisdom. AsThe SÒtra of the Arrival inLaºkasays:In the future, those who cling to non-Buddhist thinking will conceiveof the wisdom of the noble ones as existing as an object of personalexperience and as having the nature of an entity. . . . How could suchnotions operate in the noble ones? If such [notions] were entertained,they would be nothing but the clinging to an identity.andMah›mati, if various kinds of illusions are regarded as something otherrespectively, they are discriminated as [distinct] other appearances bynaïve beings, but not by the noble ones.1256The last quote points to a very important factor as to why the terms “self-empti-ness” and “other-emptiness” do not have to be contradictory. As Ruegg says:512The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 512"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"[O]ne could assume an incompatibility, at one and the same level ofreference, between two philosophical propositions, both of which can-not be true in accordance with the principle of contradiction. Alter-natively, one might perhaps suppose a complementarity — perhapseven an incommensurability — between two doctrines that relate todifferent levels of reference or discourse, and which are accordinglynot mutually exclusive or contradictory.1257In fact, this is precisely one of the major points in Dölpopa’s original presen-tation of self-emptiness and other-emptiness that was often overlooked by laterproponents of other-emptiness as well as their opponents. Despite the claims ofhis opponents, Dölpopa’s use of this distinction is epistemological in nature andnot ontological or reifying. In his main work, A Mountain Dharma, The Oceanof Definitive Meaning,1258he himself makes a clear distinction between a “philo-sophical system” (Skt. siddh›nta, Tib. grub mtha’) based on certain explanationsand arguments and a “point of view” in the sense of an outlook (Skt. darŸana, Tib.lta ba). For him, the latter is understood in the broad sense of including what isdirectly experienced in meditative equipoise. This is what he calls “Great Mad-h yamaka” and “other-emptiness,” the outlook of noble beings who see howthings really are. As such, it is clearly contrasted with Madhyamaka as a merephilosophical system. Thus, on these two levels, the entire perspective of mindand, consequently, the way of discourse are quite different.For whatever reasons, many later proponents of other-emptiness and theiropponents do not follow this epistemological distinction and often speak of bothself-emptiness and other-emptiness as philosophical systems. Dölpopa himselfnever spoke about proponents of self-emptiness as opposed to proponents ofother-emptiness. Rather, he sees self-emptiness as a philosophical system that heaccepts himself as far as it goes, which is to say, by definition not applying to thelevel of direct meditative insight. Thus, a major part of the later controversy is dueto the confusion as to whether the Rangtong-Shentong contrast pertains to thelevel of philosophical systems or the level of the direct insight in meditativeequipoise. For Dölpopa, it clearly was the contrast between a philosophical sys-tem on the one hand and a direct vision of true reality on the other.To sum up, it seems that the Rangtong-Shentong issue is only a problem if self-empty and other-empty are regarded as mutually exclusive on the same level ofrealization and discourse.In the end, the whole controversy is highly dualistic in itself, since what istalked about—emptiness or ultimate reality—is in fact neither self-empty norother-empty anyway. As the Eighth Karmapa Mikyö Dorje’s commentary onThe Ornament of Clear Realizationsays:Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 513Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 513"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"This basis—the nature of phenomena—is neither other-empty norself-empty, because it is not even suitable as a mere emptiness that isnot specified as being empty or not empty of itself or something other.The reason for this is that it has the essential character of being theutter peace of all discursiveness of being empty and not being empty.Thus, from the perspective of the [actual] freedom from discursiveness,no characteristics whatsoever of being empty of itself or somethingother transpire within the basis that is the nature of phenomena.1259As for doxographical classifications in general, they may be helpful to gain anoverview of the overwhelming amount and diversity of scriptural output of Indianand Tibetan masters. They may also be beneficially employed to refine one’s ownunderstanding against the background of ascending levels of analysis as presentedin such classifications of hierarchic tenets. However, there is the danger in allbroad categorizations, such as the classification of Buddhist teachings as self-emptyor other-empty, that they obscure or prevent attempts to look seriously at themore subtle aspects of the issues at hand. In particular, to categorize certain mas-ters as proponents of self-emptiness or other-emptiness may obstruct our view onthe often individual and specific presentations of these masters. Moreover, suchcategorizations do not take into account that many masters comment on scripturesfrom different systems, such as Yog›c›ra and Madhyamaka, in quite differentways that accord with the backgrounds of these systems. Also, since the teachingstyles of individual masters are usually adapted to the capacities and needs of indi-vidual disciples, they may teach very different things in different situations. Afterall, the teachings of the Buddha are always meant to be put into practice in orderto remove mental afflictions and suffering, and not primarily as a philosophicalsystem to be established in one way or another. Usually, in Buddhism, philo-sophical considerations come in response to practical and soteriological issues. Inthis sense, the question of the actual or ultimate view of a certain master is moot.The most obvious example is the Buddha himself, who gave an extremely widerange of teachings to many different beings in many different situations. Obvi-ously, he cannot be categorized as being a proponent of Madhyamaka, Yog›c›ra,self-emptiness, other-emptiness, or anything else. As Kapstein rightly says:I would suggest, therefore, that . . . doxographic labels such as gzhanstong pa and rang stong pa are best avoided, except of course wherethey are used within the tradition itself. Our primary task must be todocument and interpret precise concepts and arguments, and in manycases the recourse to overly broad characterizations seems only tomuddy the waters.1260514The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 514"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"Huntington agrees: In working to develop a critical intellectual history of early IndianMah›y›na, then, the focus of our attention must shift from “tenets”and “schools” . . . to individual authors and their own originalwords.1261As for the soteriological efficacy of the Buddhist teachings, no matter whichlabels may be attached to them, what counts in the end is whether their practi-cal application leads to freedom from ignorance, afflictions, and suffering. AsMaitreya’s Sublime Continuumsays, this is the criterion for genuine dharma, nomatter who teaches it.The words that are endowed with welfare, are connected to the dharma,Relinquish the afflictions of the three realms,And teach the benefit of peaceAre the words of the Great Seer.1262Their opposite is something else.Whatever is explained by someone with an undistracted mind,Inspired solely by the teachings of the Victor,And in accordance with the path of attaining liberationIs to be placed on your head just like the words of the Great Seer.1263TThe Single Final Intention of the Two Philosophical Systems of the Great VehicleThe Treasury of Knowledgeconfirms the universal acceptance in the great vehiclethat the two great system founders N›g›rjuna and Asaºga were prophesied by theBuddha and that both dwell on the levels of noble bodhisattvas. In the sky of theSage’s teaching, they resemble the sun and the moon, and there are no otherornaments more supreme than these two great scriptural traditions. In their inten-tion, there is no difference in terms of superior or inferior. Therefore, to realizethe ways of the individual scriptural systems of these two system founders with-out intermingling them is to realize that their final intention constitutes a singlemeaning. Should this appear differently to some people, the reason lies only intheir own limited understanding. By slavishly echoing minor texts of ordinarypa ̊ ̃itas who are like the dim light of stars and planets, such people only ripentrifling results. By following such an approach, they merely cultivate more dis-cursiveness in terms of negations and proofs through many fictitious scripturesand reasonings.

To comment on the intention ofvenerable Maitreya, the other-empty system is very profound. There-fore, through the scriptures and reasonings of one of these [systems],the other cannot be negated. Otherwise, [if one wanted to do so,] onewould have to strongly support the scriptures and reasonings of hon-orable Asaºga, because he was prophesied as the person to attain thestate of a noble one and differentiate [between the expedient and] thedefinitive meaning. In this way, he is the foremost system founder ofthe great vehicle. [Furthermore,] although Candrakırti resolved thatthe way of explanation of honorable Asaºga is not the intention ofnoble N›g›rjuna, he did not state that honorable Asaºga had not real-ized the meaning of Centrism.1264Pawo Rinpoche comments that, in Tibet, the intention of the lineage of pro-found view is usually explained as self-emptiness, that is, as a nonimplicativenegation in which nothing whatsoever exists as a remainder after analysis throughreasoning. The intention of the lineage of vast activity is explained as the other-empty ultimate that exists as a permanent and lasting remainder after such analy-sis. By clinging to one of these views as being the true meaning, the respectiveother one is then presented as a view of either permanence or extinction. How-ever, these one-sided options, such as existence, nonexistence, permanence, andextinction, are neither the ultimate of the lineage of profound view nor the ulti-mate of the lineage of vast activity. As The Fundamental Versessays:To say “existence” is the clinging to permanence.To say “nonexistence” is the view of extinction.Therefore, the learned should not dwellIn either existence or nonexistence.1265516The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 516"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"The lineage of vast activity explains that both existence and nonexistence arejust imaginary; they are completely nonexistent, just like a sky-flower.

The first two among these are the conceptions aboutnonexistence and the conceptions about existence. Maitreya’s Distinction betweenthe Middle and Extremesstates:Neither empty nor nonempty—In this way, everything is explained.1267In general, Pawo Rinpoche says, the intentions of these two systems of thegreat vehicle are one and the same. The reasons for this are as follows: As shownabove, the seeming in the explanation of the two realities in the lineage of pro-found view is simply classified as twofold in the lineage of vast activity. All super-impositions, such as names, are called the imaginary nature, and the delusiveappearances of dependent origination are designated as the other-dependentnature. The ultimate is referred to as the perfect nature. However, both systemsteach that the actual ultimate is the utter peace of all discursiveness.1268Through the example of floating hairs that do not exist by their nature and arenot even real at the time when they appear for those with blurred vision, both lin-eages teach that the seeming is illusionlike. They agree that, just as space is notestablished as anything and yet is omnipresent, the ultimate cannot be pinpointedas anything whatsoever, and yet it is not the case that it does not pervade all phe-nomena. It is the nature of being beyond speech, thought, and expression. There-fore, in the lineage of profound view, the elimination of the clinging to theextremes of superimposition and denial is given the name “realizing the true real-ity.” The lineage of vast activity says that once the appearances of floating hairsvanish through the removal of blurred vision, space is seen just as it is. Likewise,the vanishing of the appearances of the other-dependent nature through theremoval of even the most subtle levels of the imaginary nature is referred to by theconventional expression of “seeing the perfect nature.” Therefore, in the end, thereis not even a slight difference between the presentations of these two lineages.Furthermore, since knower and what is known are just mutually dependentconcepts, ultimately, neither is established. Thus, what is referred to by suchconventional expressions as “liberation,” “nirv› ̊a,” “seeing what is true,” or“residing in the expanse of dharmas” is nothing but the state of having let go ofmistakenly setting up reference points in terms of superimposition and denial.The Ornament of SÒtrassays:Therefore, liberation is only the exhaustion of mistakenness.Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 517Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 517"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"Here, in terms of the ultimate mode of being,There is no difference between peace and arising.1269The Distinction between the Middle and Extremesagrees:As for false imagination, . . .Once it is exhausted, this is asserted as liberation.1270The Fundamental Versesstates:Where there is no production of nirv› ̊a,There is no elimination of cyclic existence either.So what is cyclic existence,And which nirv› ̊a do you consider?When thinking in terms of self and mineWith regard to the external and the internal is exhausted,The perpetuating [aggregates] will cease.Since they cease, birth is exhausted [too].Liberation [is attained] through the exhaustion of karma and afflictions.Karma and afflictions [come] from conceptions,And these [result] from discursiveness.Discursiveness is halted through emptiness.1271Just as in Centrism, the lineage of vast activity simply regards an extreme as anyrigid assertion about the true nature of phenomena. This is well elucidated inVasubandhu’s commentary on the list of twenty-eight extremes in The Distinc-tion between the Middle and ExtremesV.23–26.1272Like the Centrists, he uses thewell-known passage from The K›Ÿyapa Chapter SÒtraas the source for “the prac-tice of the middle path of eliminating all extremes.”1273A few of his commentsmay suffice:The middle path for completely relinquishing the [extremes of iden-tity and identitylessness] is that which is the middle between bothidentity and identitylessness, that is, nonconceptuality as such. . . .The middle path for completely relinquishing the [extremes of mindbeing real or not] is that in which there is no mind (citta), no inten-tion, no mental cognition, and no consciousness. . . .518The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 518"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"The middle path for completely relinquishing the [extremes of appre-hender and apprehended] is [referred to in] the extensive passage about“awareness and unawareness not existing as two” [in The K›ŸyapaChapter SÒtra], because awareness, unawareness, and such do not existas any entities of apprehender and apprehended. . . .The middle path for completely relinquishing the [extremes of entitiesand nonentities] is the extensive passage [in this sÒtra] that says, “Theperson is not empty, because it is destroyed, but the person is emptyjust through emptiness.

Conceptionsof something that pacifies are also an extreme, because one fears empti-ness through thinking about something to be relinquished and some-thing that relinquishes it. In order to completely relinquish these twoextremes of conceptions, the example of space [is given].1274In addition, Vasubandhu comments on verse 1.2 of the same text:As for “This is the middle path,” it means that everything is neitherabsolutely empty nor absolutely nonempty. In this way, such is inaccordance with what appears in the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtrasand others:All this is neither empty nor nonempty.1275This shows that, fundamentally, Maitreya’s and Vasubandhu’s view of themiddle is not different from the Centrist understanding, since both wish to ridmind of all kinds of fixed views and reference points that prevent recognition ofthe true nature of phenomena and thus lead to suffering. Just as for Centrists,according to Vasubandhu, the realization of emptiness is a state in which all dis-cursiveness and reference points are absent.Thus, whether this is based on practicing the system of Yog›c›ra or Centrism,once mind lets go of all reference points (in the phase of putting an end to allbases for views), the two systems of the great vehicle are clearly revealed to havethe same intention. Initially, Centrism focuses mainly on negating all theoriza-tion in terms of thinking, language, and reasoning, while Yog›c›ra affirms andemphasizes subjective experience. In other words, Centrists strip mind of all ref-erence points and do not talk much about the experiencer of this process.Yog›c›ras too strive to eliminate the imaginary constructs of mind, but theyfocus more on the knowing of this process and the underlying primordial purityIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 519Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 519"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"of mind.

Thefive characteristics of the ultimate are the characteristic of being inex-pressible, the characteristic of being nondual, the characteristic of beingcompletely beyond the sphere of dialectic, the characteristic of beingcompletely beyond difference and nondifference, and the characteris-tic of being of one taste in everything.1276The Ornament of SÒtrassays:Neither existent nor non-existent, neither thus nor otherwise,Neither arising nor ceasing, neither increasing nor decreasing,Not purified and yet purified again—These are the characteristics of the ultimate.1277The Sublime Continuumspeaks about the dharma as the realization of theultimate:Neither nonexistent nor existent, neither [both] existent and nonexistentnor something other than existent and nonexistent:It cannot be conceived as any of these, is free from verbalization, and is tobe personally realized and peaceful.1278The same text says about Buddhahood:It is not an object of speech, constituted by the ultimate,Not the domain of reasoning, beyond example,Unsurpassable, neither included in [samsaric] existence nor [nirvanic]peace.For all these reasons, the sphere of the Victors is inconceivable even for the noble ones.1279520The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 520"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"This corresponds well with N›g›rjuna’s characteristics of true reality in hisFun-damental Verses:Not known from something other, peaceful,Not discursive through discursiveness,Without conceptions, and without distinctions:These are the characteristics of true reality.1280On the reverse side, more affirmative descriptions of ultimate reality are notnecessarily limited to the texts of the lineage of vast activity. N›g›rjuna’s Praiseto the Expanse of Dharmasstates:Imagine that a [metal] garment that has been purified through fireBecomes contaminated by various kinds of stains later.When it is put into a fire [again],Its stains are burned, but the garment is not.Likewise, luminous mindHas the stains of desire and so forth.The fire of wisdom burns its stains,But not luminous true reality.All the many sÒtras spoken by the VictorThat teach emptinessMake the afflictions subside,But they do not weaken the basic element.1281The eleventh chapter of The Entrance into Centrismexplains the final result ofenlightenment with all its qualities, such as the ten powers, in detail. In brief:What is profound is emptiness.The other qualities are vast.Through the knowledge of the mode of profundity and vastness,These qualities will be obtained.1282In the same vein, as mentioned before, the Eighth Karmapa’s introduction to TheChariot of the Tagbo Siddhassays that, implicitly, Maitrıpa’s system of Centrismalso teaches the profound actuality of both sÒtras and tantras, which is Buddhanature, the ordinary and extraordinary ultimate Heart of the Blissfully GoneOnes.1283All nonsectarian Shentong masters, such as the Seventh Karmapa ChötraIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 521Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 521"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"Gyamtso, ⁄›kya Chogden, and Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye, agree that the sys-tems of N›g›rjuna and Asaºga do not exclude each other and are in fact comple-mentary. The Seventh Karmapa states in his Ocean of Texts on Reasoning that theirsystems are identical in their ultimate essential point, because N›g›rjuna mainlydetermines the nature of phenomena from the side of outer objects, while Asaºgadoes the same mainly from the side of the inner subject, the mind. He says:Therefore, the great Yog›c›ra Centrists who follow noble Asaºga andhis brother mainly teach the wisdom that realizes self-aware, self-lumi-nous mind by ascertaining that the dualistic appearances of appre-hender and apprehended that obscure true reality are not establishedin the way they [appear].Noble N›g›rjuna and his spiritual heirs mainly teach that the natureof luminous mind abides as emptiness by thoroughly analyzing theclinging to real [existence] and its objects that obscure true realitythrough the great [Centrist] arguments. In this way, they ascertainthat [this clinging and its objects] are without nature.Both systems do not differ in teaching the final true reality, sincethis very nature of luminous mind primordially is emptiness, andthis emptiness primordially abides as the essential character of lumi-nosity.1284When speaking of the unity of these systems by means of the terminology ofself-emptiness and other-emptiness, the above masters emphasize that a properunderstanding of the approach of self-emptiness is in fact indispensable for a cor-rect, nonreifying understanding of other-emptiness. When properly combined,the approaches of self-emptiness and other-emptiness eliminate the more subtlelevels of the extremes of existence and nonexistence respectively. Moreover, theCentrist—specifically the Consequentialist—approach is not merely a skillfulmeans to cut through discursiveness and reference points on the seeming level,but it is definitely a means to point beyond this level to the ultimate that is inex-pressible and inconceivable. Thus, in terms of what is to be finally realized, thereis no contradiction to the approach of other-emptiness that agrees that the ulti-mate is inexpressible, inconceivable, and nondualistic, while its indications ofultimate reality mainly serve to highlight the experiential character of mind real-izing its own ultimate nature. In other words, the positive description of a non-conceptual experience of ultimate reality in the teachings on other-emptinessonly starts to speak to us from within the “noble silence” of the complete free-dom from all discursiveness (as illustrated in the VimalakırtisÒtra) that is arrived522The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 522"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"at through the teachings on self-emptiness.In brief, Centrists focus more on the objective side and dissolve all referencepoints within the mind, including mind itself. In this way, they attempt to let usawaken into an uncontrived experience of the ultimate nature of this very mindwithout any seeming obscurations or reference points. Yog›c›ra focuses more onthe subjective side—mind itself—and describes both its impure and pure aspects.The journey from the impure appearance to the pure nature of the mind leadsthrough the provisional and seeming stages of “mere mind” and the nondualityof apprehender and apprehended to nonconceptual wisdom as the experientialdimension of ultimate reality.Considering the example of blurred vision that is used by both systems, whenthe eye disease has been removed and the appearances of floating hairs have dis-appeared, what is seen is the clear sky. This aspect of clearly seeing the open skyas it is corresponds to the final view of suchness (the perfect nature) of the line-age of vast activity. The suchness as explained by the lineage of profound viewthrough this example is the very freedom from the appearances of floating hairs.Thus, the only difference is that the lineage of profound view emphasizes morethe aspect of freedom from delusion, while the lineage of vast activity emphasizesmore what is seen within this freedom. In other words, the latter tells more aboutthe experiential side of reaching the state of being free from all clinging and ref-erence points.As a slightly more frivolous example of different approaches to the same end,imagine three people sitting in a park and happily munching on the latest candybar on the market. Some other people may come by and ask, “How does it taste?”The first of the three munchers may just stay silent and keep munching. The sec-ond states, “It is beyond words.” The third raves, “It’s the most wonderful tastein my whole life, fabulous, amazing!” Curious, some of the onlookers sit downin front of the first muncher, waiting for the direct candy bar transmission. Thisgroup consists of those of both the sharpest and the dullest faculties. The moreanalytically minded, fond of cryptic riddles, may further question the secondmuncher, “Can’t you delineate it with some hints?” Those with a more emo-tional and imaginative mind probably request of the third muncher, “We needto hear everything about this wonderful taste.” The second muncher may reply,“It’s not like Snickers, not Mars, not M&M . . .” Naturally, the third utters allthe most poetic and rich imagery about this new taste.So, who is right? Is anybody describing the taste more correctly than the oth-ers? In terms of the actual experience of that taste, whatever is said or not said,whatever is heard or not heard, and whatever is conceptualized on the basis of allthat, is wrong anyway, since none of it isthe actual experience of this taste. Atthe same time, there is no problem in any of the three munchers’ approachesprecisely because this taste is inexpressible, so it does not matter whether they justIs There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 523Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 523"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"stay silent or describe it in one way or the other. The only reason they can go ondescribing it endlessly is that it is indescribable. However, there is more to thesethree approaches, since each one can be seen as an attempt to communicate theway in which other people eventually come to know how the new candy bartastes. The people of highest capacities in front of the silent muncher get it aftera while and leave, while those of dullest wits keep waiting for “it” to happen.The analytical questioners give up at some point during “not this, not that” andleave too. The people in the third group also leave once their mouths waterenough. Where did they all go? Those who got the point will meet at the grocerystore around the corner and have their munch-in. In different ways, they all real-ized that the only way to know how this candy bar tastes is to get one of theirown, put it in their mouths, and chew. Only those who kept waiting for theeffortless and spontaneous taste transmission and eventually dispersed after their“guru” has left them (to finally buythem the new bar) are not to be found munch-ing at the store.1285Clearly, the Buddha used all three approaches to communicate that we canexperience the taste of mental freedom only by making our own steps on thepath that leads there. This can be seen in the wide range of styles in his instruc-tions, such as sometimes answering by remaining silent (as Vimalakırti does),teaching the nonreferential Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras, and teaching the sÒtras thatrichly describe the qualities of Buddha nature, pure Buddha realms, and enlight-enment. The varying approaches of N›g›rjuna, Asaºga, and other masters maybe regarded in the same way.As for the details of pointing out the actual path that leads to mental freedom,the two lineages of profound view and vast conduct employ different styles ofguidance, but they arrive at the same destination. Both Asaºga and N›g›rjunaknow the wonderful castle in the middle of town that we all wish to see. Explain-ing the route to get there, N›g›rjuna would only say such things as, “If you fol-low this road, you will get to a dead end. If you follow that avenue, you will facea lot of one-way streets and just go in circles. This way, you will end up on thehighway out of town. Here, there is a major construction site and you’ll get com-pletely lost.” In this way, he excludes all the wrong ways, false exits, and blockedroads. What remains unsaid is the right way to arrive at our sightseeing place.Asaºga’s approach seems to be more straightforward, since he just tells uswhere to go: “Start on highway 1, take exit 24, go to the left up to this rotary, fol-low the signs that say ‘Center,’ and you will arrive at this magnificent castle withbeautiful gardens and lakes.” This seems easier, but once we hop into our car, wemight become confused about the right exit and which rotary is the one we aresupposed to take, because there is heavy traffic and we get lost. Then, N›g›rjuna’sprecise instructions on where not to go and why come into play. We can clearly524The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 524"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"identify the wrong roads and say, “No, that’s not it, we have to go further.” Onthe other hand, once we are on our way, just knowing all the roads on the townmap that are not to be taken does not always immediately give us a clear ideawhere we should actually go. So knowing that there must be a certain rotarycoming up soon is also helpful.This approach of using the description of which roads and turns we have totake while identifying the ones to avoid is precisely how we usually try to find ourway. Thus, the most effective path is to combine the approaches of the lineageof profound view and vast conduct. N›g›rjuna’s style might have the occasionaldrawback of losing sight of the final destination by dealing exclusively with side-tracks. However, it also has the bonus of the surprise effect when we actuallyarrive at this breathtaking castle. With Asaºga’s style, there is hardly any chancethat we will forget about the castle, since it is so abundantly described, but wemight also sometimes get stuck in these descriptions and daydream about thecastle instead of actually proceeding toward it. ⁄›kya Chogden summarizes theneed for both approaches as follows:If there were not these texts of Asaºga’s position—The dharma system of the fundamental ground and the presentation of the three emptinesses—Through what could the basis of purification and the means forpurificationAs well as the presentation of outer, inner, and other in the texts of the great mode of being1286be explained?If there were not the way in which nondual wisdom is empty of natureThat is differentiated by the texts of Consequentialists and Autonomists,What would relinquish our clinging to profound luminous wisdom’s realityAnd our conceptions of being attached to magnificent deities?1287I would like to conclude this chapter with a famous verse that is found in a num-ber of texts of both the lineage of profound view and the lineage of vast activity:There is nothing to be removed from itAnd not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is to be seen as it really is—Who sees actual reality is released.1288Is There Such a Thing as Shentong-Madhyamaka? 525Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 525"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"Gampopa’s Jewel Ornament of Liberation1289says that this verse originally stemsfrom The SÒtra Requested by Sky Treasure.1290It is one of the most essential versesin both The Sublime Continuum(I.154) and The Ornament of Clear Realization(V.21) by Maitreya.

In the second phase of putting an end to identity, throughapplying slight analysis, one eliminates all mistaken views about personal andphenomenal identities. During the third phase of putting an end to all viewsthrough becoming fully immersed in excellent analysis, all reference points ofany kind of view will finally dissolve. As Pawo Rinpoche says:[Actually,] in the Centrist system itself, the stage of no analysis throughreasoning refers to the cycle [of teachings] that first puts an end towhat is not meritorious, that is, the vehicle that [leads to] the higherrealms. The intermediate phase of putting an end to identity means[using] Centrist reasonings to counteract [all types of] clinging in Bud-dhist and non-Buddhist philosophical systems. The phase of puttingan end to all bases for views refers to the final complete elimination of[any] clinging to true reality. Hence, there is no need for anybody toreduce these [phases] or add anything to them. By relating all thesethree [stages of no analysis, slight analysis, and intense analysis] solelyto the intermediate phase of putting an end to identity, clinging tothe nonexistence of the dross [of mental obscurations] and clinging tothe existence of the pure essence [of the mind] are developed. [More-over,] one [mistakenly] considers merely not giving an answer as theultimate actuality.1299The Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje says:In general terms, Noble [N›g›rjuna]’s “wheel that puts an end to allbases for views” and Venerable [Maitreya]’s “wheel of prophecy” come528The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 528"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"down to the same essential point. This essential point is that whateveris the final wheel is necessarily the wheel that teaches freedom from dis-cursiveness. [However,] there are some particular distinct featuresthrough which they are not the same. In the former [wheel], nothingbut mere freedom from discursiveness is taught, while the latterexplains the distinctive feature that the wisdom free from discursive-ness is to be experienced by the wisdom through which it is personallyencountered. One might wonder, “Is it then the case that N›g›rjunaand his spiritual heirs do not assert the wisdom that is free from dis-cursiveness?” No, this is not the case, since they explicitly teach it insuch [works] as The Collection of Praisesand The Four Hundred Verseson the Yogic Practice of Bodhisattvas.1300Expedient Meaning and Definitive Meaning DefinedMikyö Dorje, Pawo Rinpoche, and Padma Karpo agree that the distinctionbetween expedient and definitive meaning is itself only made on the level of theexpedient meaning. In terms of the actual definitive meaning, the Buddha nevertaught anything whatsoever. As a sÒtra says:⁄›ntamati, between the night that the Thus-Gone One became a fullyperfect Buddha in unsurpassable, utterly perfect enlightenment andthe night that he will pass into complete nirv› ̊a, the Thus-Gone Onedid not speak so much as a single syllable, nor will he speak any.The Fundamental Versesagrees:At no time did the Buddha teachAny dharma to anybody.1301From the perspective of various disciples, however, it seems that the Buddhataught in many different ways according to their capacities and needs. Whenclassifying his teachings as the three turnings of the wheel of dharma, which areof expedient meaning and which are of definitive meaning? Different sÒtras andtreatises make varying distinctions. The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentionsays:Initially, at the site of the antelope grove of ¿i ̋ivadana near V›r› ̊asi,the Blessed One taught the four realities of the noble ones to those whohad correctly entered the vehicle of the hearers. Thus, he turned thewonderful and marvelous wheel of dharma. . . . This turning of thewheel of dharma by the Blessed One is surpassable, and there is a pos-sibility [for refutation]. It is of expedient meaning and a basis for debate.The Distinction between Expedient and Definitive Meaning529Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 529"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"Then, starting with the lack of a nature of phenomena, he [taught]that they lack arising and lack ceasing, that they are primordial peaceand by nature perfect nirv› ̊a.

This turning of the wheel of dharma by the BlessedOne is unsurpassable, and there is no chance [for refutation]. It is ofdefinitive meaning and not a basis for debate.1302The SÒtra Requested by King Dh›ra ̊ıŸvaradescribes the process of cleansing anencrusted jewel in three stages with increasingly refined chemical solutions andcloths. This analogy serves to illustrate the progressively advanced teachings of theBuddha:Likewise, the Thus-Gone One knows the potentials of very impuresentient beings, and through his words [that cause] revulsion, such asimpermanence, suffering, identitylessness, and impurity, he producesweariness in those sentient beings who like cyclic existence. Thus, heintroduces them to the noble dharma of the vinaya. [However,] theThus-Gone One does not confine himself to this amount of effort.Thereafter, through speaking on emptiness, signlessness, and wish-lessness, he makes them realize the way of being of the Thus-GoneOnes. [However,] the Thus-Gone One does not confine himself tothis amount of effort either. Through speaking on the wheel of irre-versibility and by speaking on the complete purity of the three spheres,he makes sentient beings with their causal [potentials] of variousnatures engage in the object of the Thus-Gone Ones.1303Both The SÒtra of the Teaching of Ak ̋ayamati1304and The SÒtra of the King OfMeditative Concentrationmake a general distinction between expedient and defin-itive meaning, but do not relate this to an evaluation of the three turnings of the530The Center of the Sunlit Sky530The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 530"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"wheel of dharma. In its explanation of the inexhaustible four reliances, The SÒtraof the Teaching of Ak ̋ayamatistates:One may wonder, “What are sÒtras of expedient meaning?” The sÒtrasthat teach seeming reality are of expedient meaning. “What are sÒtrasof definitive meaning?” The sÒtras that are taught in order to revealultimate reality are of definitive meaning. The sÒtras in which mani-fold words and letters are used are of expedient meaning. The sÒtrasthat speak about the profound that is difficult to see and difficult torealize are of definitive meaning. The sÒtras that use a variety of termsand phrasings in a manner as if there were an owner where there is noowner, such as self, sentient being, soul, [life-]sustainer, individual,person, Manu-born,1305son of Manu,1306agent, or experiencer are ofexpedient meaning. The sÒtras that teach emptiness, signlessness, wish-lessness, nonapplication, nonorigination, nonarising, nonentity, noself, no sentient beings, no soul, no person, no owner up through thedoors to complete liberation are of definitive meaning. Thus, rely onthe sÒtra collection of definitive meaning, but do not rely on the sÒtracollection of expedient meaning.1307In explaining the meaning of this passage in his Chariot of the Tagbo Siddhas,1308the Eighth Karmapa says that the sÒtras’ explicit meaning that can be invalidatedthrough reasoning is of expedient meaning. For in order to initially introduce dis-ciples to the path and to mature their mental continua, these scriptures prima-rily teach seeming reality through various words and letters that are adapted tothe minds and inclinations of individual persons. Thus, the explicit words ofsuch teachings can be invalidated through reasoning, but they are neverthelesspronounced as means to guide various disciples gradually. On the other hand, thesÒtras’ explicit meaning that cannot be invalidated through reasoning is of defin-itive meaning. Through the profound actuality that is difficult to see and pri-mordially void, these texts teach ultimate reality in accordance with the wisdomof the noble ones in order that the disciples engage in the fruition and that theirmental continua become liberated. These texts are a cause for the attainment ofliberation, since they cannot be invalidated through reasoning and produce therealization of this profound actuality while being taught.All in all, The SÒtra of the Teaching of Ak ̋ayamatilists eight criteria that dis-tinguish expedient and definitive meaning:1) The expedient meaning assists entry onto the path, while the definitive mean-ing guides disciples to engage in the fruition.The Distinction between Expedient and Definitive Meaning531Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 531"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"2) The expedient meaning deals with the seeming, while the definitive meaningdeals with the ultimate.3) The expedient meaning teaches about afflicted phenomena, and the definitivemeaning teaches about purified phenomena.4) The expedient meaning teaches how to engage in proper actions, and thedefinitive meaning shows how karma and afflictions become exhausted.5) The expedient meaning causes weariness with cyclic existence, while the defini-tive meaning demonstrates that cyclic existence and nirv› ̊a are undifferentiable.6) The expedient meaning teaches a variety of terms and definitions, whereas thedefinitive meaning teaches the profound, true reality that is difficult to seeand realize.7) The expedient meaning gives detailed explanations in accordance with worldlyconduct, while the definitive meaning focuses on concise and pithy instruc-tions for cultivating meditative concentration.8) The expedient meaning teaches about sentient beings, persons, a self, and soon, while the definitive meaning teaches about the three doors to complete lib-eration, nonapplication, nonorigination, nonarising, nonentity, identityless-ness, and such.The SÒtra of the King Of Meditative Concentrationsays:According to how the Blissfully-Gone One explained emptiness,One understands the specific feature of the sÒtra collection of definitivemeaning.All those dharmas in which sentient beings, persons, and individuals are taughtAre understood to be of expedient meaning.1309Thus, this sÒtra distinguishes between expedient and definitive meaning in a waythat accords with the eighth of the above points in The SÒtra of the Teaching ofAk ̋ayamati. N›g›rjuna’s Praise to the Inconceivableobviously follows these sÒtras:It is the nectar of the teachings of the Buddhas,Called “the gift of the dharma,”That is declared to be the definitive meaning.This is only the emptiness of phenomena.The instructions on arising, ceasing, and such,As well as on sentient beings, souls, and so on,Have been taught by you, O Protector,To be of expedient meaning and in terms of the seeming.1310532The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 532"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"Avalokitavrata in his Commentary on The Lamp of Knowledgealso complies withthe distinction made by these sÒtras.1311Candrakırti’s Lucid Wordssays that N›g›rjuna’s Fundamental Verseswere com-posed in order to demonstrate the distinction between sÒtras of expedient anddefinitive meaning. Here, the teachings on arising and such in terms of depend-ent origination are not given with respect to the nature of the object of the uncon-taminated wisdom of those who are free from the blurred vision of ignorance.Rather, they are given with respect to the objects of the consciousnesses of thosewhose eyes of insight are impaired by such blurred vision. With respect to see-ing true reality, Candrakırti quotes the Buddha:Oh fully ordained monks, this is ultimate reality. It is as follows:Nirv› ̊a has the property of being undeceiving, whereas all formationshave the property of being delusive and deceiving.Through not understanding the true intention of the Buddha’s teaching in thisway, some people may entertain doubts as to which teachings pertain to actualtrue reality and which have a certain intention. Also, due to weak intelligence, cer-tain people may understand teachings of expedient meaning as being of defini-tive meaning. Hence, N›g›rjuna wrote his text for the sake of eliminating thedoubts and wrong ideas of these two kinds of disciples. These statements arethen followed by the above two quotations from The SÒtra of the King Of Med-itative Concentrationand The SÒtra of the Teaching of Ak ̋ayamati.1312Candrakırti’sEntrance into Centrismtakes the same approach:Once you have understood the account of the scriptures in this way,Understand that the sÒtras that are not true reality and have a meaning to be explainedAre taught as the expedient meaning. Having realized this, they are for guidance.Those that bear the meaning of emptiness are of definitive meaning.1313His autocommentary explains that this distinction between the expedient and thedefinitive meanings is based on the above-cited two sÒtras: The SÒtra of the Teach-ing of Ak ̋ayamatiand The SÒtra of the King of Meditative Concentration.1314Theonly extant Indian commentary on The Entrance into Centrism,by Jay›nanda,follows this distinction and elaborates on it.1315Karmapa Mikyö Dorje commentson Candrakırti’s above verse by saying that those sÒtras which do not explicitlyelucidate the true reality of dependent origination free from the eight extremessuch as arising1316and which have an explicit meaning that is to be explained fur-ther (such as arising, ceasing, or an intrinsic reality) are taught as the expedientThe Distinction between Expedient and Definitive Meaning533Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 533"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"meaning for the sake of guiding individual disciples in approaching the profoundultimate actuality. On the other hand, those sÒtras that bear the meaning ofexplicitly teaching dependent origination free from the eight extremes as empti-ness are of definitive meaning. For, unlike the expedient meaning, the definitivemeaning can by definition not serve to guide disciples toward anything otherthan what it says in itself.Relating the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma to the Two Levels of MeaningThere are different presentations as to which of the three turnings of the wheelof dharma are of expedient meaning and which are of definitive meaning. Every-body in the great vehicle seems to agree that the first turning is of expedientmeaning. The dispute concerns the status of the second and third turnings.The Treasury of Knowledge1317says the following: By quotingThe SÒtra ThatUnravels the Intention, Asaºga’s Synopsis of Ascertainmentexplains that the thirdturning is the final definitive meaning.1318Vasubandhu agrees with this posi-tion.1319However, both Asaºga and Vasubandhu never say that the second turn-ing of the wheel of dharma is of expedient meaning.1320As for N›g›rjuna andfiryadeva, both take the threefold process of cleansing in The SÒtra Requested byKing Dh›ra ̊ıŸvarato be of definitive meaning. Candrakırti only makes a generaldistinction between sÒtras of expedient and definitive meaning based on TheSÒtra of the Teaching of Ak ̋ayamati. However, nowhere does he give a presenta-tion of the three turnings of the wheel of dharma, let alone relate his distinctionof expedient and definitive meaning to these three turnings. It seems that Tibetanteachers did a lot of chattering about discriminating between the second andthird turnings in terms of expedient versus definitive meaning and supreme ver-sus inferior without having properly examined this situation. In terms of theeight criteria in The SÒtra of the Teaching of Ak ̋ayamatithat distinguish the expe-dient from the definitive meaning, the first seven are equal in putting both thesecond and third turnings in the category of the definitive meaning. As for theeighth criterion—identitylessness—Candrakırti presented merely being emptyof the two kinds of identity as the definitive meaning. Asaºga, Vasubandhu, andtheir followers determine that the meaning of identitylessness refers to the nonex-istence of any kind of identity as imagined by naïve beings, and they contrast thiswith what the Buddha taught about Buddha nature and how the latter is not tobe mistaken for a self or any kind of identity. Thus, they say that the second andthird turnings are equally of definitive meaning. The difference is that the sec-ond turning is the definitive meaning that cuts through temporary referencepoints, while the third turning is the definitive meaning that teaches the finalbasic nature.1321As indicated by this, the issue of how expedient and definitive meaning are534The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 534"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"related to the second and third turnings turned into a major controversy in Tibet.Those who assert that the second turning is of definitive meaning and the thirdof expedient meaning are mainly found in the Gelugpa school. In this school, itis often said that “only the second turning of the wheel of dharma is the finaldefinitive meaning, since Candrakırti has explained it this way.” However, thisis not justified for two main reasons. First, as was explained earlier, Candrakırtionly distinguished between sÒtras of expedient and definitive meaning accordingto The SÒtra of the Teaching of Ak ̋ayamati, without relating this distinction to thethree turnings. All he said was that sÒtras of definitive meaning are those thatteach emptiness, the lack of arising, and so on. Second, even when taking this cri-terion and applying it to the three turnings, one can find numerous passages inthe sÒtras of the third turning that teach emptiness equally clearly. Moreover,there are even some passages in the sÒtras of the first turning that teach the mean-ing of emptiness, such as the negation of the four extremes of existence, nonex-istence, and so on in the Kaccay›nagottasutta.1322Therefore, Candrakırti’sdistinction between the two levels of meaning cannot be used to support theclaim that only the second turning is of definitive meaning. In addition, if onlythe second turning were of definitive meaning and the other two of expedientmeaning, one might ask how much sense it makes for the Buddha to have taughtfirst the expedient meaning, then the definitive meaning, and finally again noth-ing but the expedient meaning.There is a further mistaken view, which says, “In the texts of the lineage of pro-found view, expressions such as ‘all phenomena lack arising’ are explained assomething to be taken literally. In the scriptures of the lineage of vast activity,based on the fact that the Buddha used such expressions with the threefold lackof nature in mind, they are explained as something that is not to be taken liter-ally.” However, in the lineage of profound view, ultimately, expressions such as“all phenomena lack arising” are also not to be taken literally because arising andnonarising are mutually dependent. If there really is arising, its lack cannot beestablished. If there is no arising, a lack of arising that depends on arising in thefirst place cannot be established either. Thus, no matter in which turning theyappear, expressions such as “all phenomena lack arising” are only taught forbeginners in order to remove their clinging to arising and ceasing and so on.Hence, these statements were made with an intention behind them.Others claim that only the third turning is of definitive meaning. Some ofthem say, “The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentiondeclares that the sÒtras thatteach that all phenomena are without nature are of expedient meaning. It saysthat those sÒtras are of definitive meaning that teach that the imaginary naturedoes not exist, while the other-dependent nature and the perfect nature exist. Sowhat about this statement?” Mere Mentalists take it literally, thus claiming thatthe sÒtras of the second turning, such as the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras, which teachThe Distinction between Expedient and Definitive Meaning535Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 535"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"that all phenomena are without nature, are of expedient meaning. The sÒtras ofthe final turning, such as The SÒtra That Unravels the Intention, are held to be ofdefinitive meaning, since they distinctly teach which among the three naturesexist and which do not.The Eighth Karmapa rejects all such positions. First, he makes it clear thatexplicit teachings, such as “all phenomena are devoid of nature,” are of definitivemeaning. They are definitive because they cannot be invalidated through rea-soning, whereas all attempts to invalidate them, such as presuming arising fromany of the four extremes, have already been refuted and will continue to berefuted. Furthermore, the real existence of the other-dependent nature and theperfect nature can also be invalidated through reasoning. The existence of a sub-stantially established other-dependent nature has been refuted, for example, inThe Entrance into Centrism.1323And, if such an other-dependent nature does notexist, then a real nature of phenomena (the perfect nature) that lacks a bearer ofthis nature (the other-dependent nature) is impossible.The Eighth Karmapa then presents the Centrist opinion on this issue, whichis that such texts as The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentionalso teach exclusivelyin accordance with what Centrists say. For them, all classifications of existenceand nonexistence with regard to the three natures in these sÒtras are of expedi-ent meaning, and their meaning is not to be taken literally. The definitive mean-ing is that all three natures lack a nature. For example, this sÒtra makes numeroussuch statements as:SubhÒti, why is this? Ultimate suchness, or phenomenal identityless-ness, is not something that has originated from causes. It is not con-ditioned, nor [is it] that which is not the ultimate. There is no need tosearch for an ultimate other than that ultimate.1324The sÒtra teaches that all three natures refer to nothing but the lack of a nature:That which is the perfect characteristic of phenomena is called “theultimate lack of nature.” Param›rthasamudgata, why is this? Thatwhich is phenomenal identitylessness is called “their lack of nature.”This is the ultimate. Since the ultimate is characterized by being thelack of nature of all phenomena, it is called “the ultimate lack ofnature.” Param›rthasamudgata, for example, you should regard thelack of a nature in terms of characteristics as being like a sky-flower.For example, Param›rthasamudgata, you should view the lack of anature in terms of arising as being like an illusion that has been con-jured up. The ultimate lack of nature should be regarded as being onewith this. For example, Param›rthasamudgata, [space] is characterized536The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 536"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"by being the mere lack of a nature of forms within space and by beingomnipresent. Likewise, you should regard the ultimate lack of natureas that which is characterized by being phenomenal identitylessnessand omnipresent.1325As for the Centrists themselves, KamalaŸıla in his Illumination of Centrismquotes the above sÒtra and also interprets it as referring to the lack of nature asunderstood by Centrists.1326Furthermore, N›g›rjuna’s Commentary on the Mindof Enlightenmentsays:As for the imaginary, the other-dependent,And the perfect [natures],Their nature is the single character of emptiness.They are imputations onto mind.1327The explanations by the lineage of vast activity say exactly the same in regardto the lack of nature. For example, The Ornament of SÒtrasdeclares:If one knows the emptiness of the nonexistent,Likewise the emptiness of the existent,And also natural emptiness,Then this is expressed as “knowing emptiness.”1328Vasubandhu’s Thirty Versesagrees:Based on the three kinds of lack of natureOf the three kinds of nature,It is taught that all phenomenaAre without nature.1329Moreover, in his Commentary on The SÒtra That Unravels the Intention, Asaºgasays in the context of the sÒtra’s seventh chapter that the threefold lack of natureis taught as a remedy for four wrong ideas about the meaning of what is taughtthrough the lack of nature. For example, it is a misconception to think that thelack of nature is mere nonexistence or to believe that what is without nature can-not arise even as a mere appearance on the seeming level.1330On the passage in thesÒtra’s eighth chapter that talks about the characteristics of emptiness, such as theimaginary characteristic, the other-dependent characteristic, and the perfect char-acteristic, he comments that these are taught in order to eliminate the fear ofemptiness.1331Since sÒtras such as The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentionteach this definitiveThe Distinction between Expedient and Definitive Meaning537Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 537"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"meaning, they do not teach according to the assertions of Mere Mentalism.Therefore, they cannot be established as sÒtras that teach Mere Mentalism orMind Only. In fact, all the individual assertions of realists (such as Mere Men-talists) that contradict both realities do not constitute the meaning as it isexplained in the Buddha’s teachings. If they did, all his teachings would be self-contradictory and could be invalidated through reasoning. This would contradictthe fact that the Buddha speaks about the dharma with the complete self-confi-dence that nothing of what he says can be refuted by anyone.1332If these teach-ings really conveyed what Mere Mentalists propose, this would also mean that theBuddha is not omniscient and just teaches others without having resolved themeaning for himself. Furthermore, it would contradict the fact that all his teach-ings have different letters but conform to one meaning. As The SÒtra of the Kingof Meditative Concentrationsays:The sÒtras that I taughtIn many thousands of worldly realmsHave different letters but one meaning.Thus, to take the teachings of expedient meaning to be of definitive meaning isto be mistaken about what the Buddha explains. As The Ornament of SÒtrasstates:If one understands [just] the literal meaning,One becomes arrogant and one’s mind deteriorates.Through rejecting the excellent teachings,One will be pulverized and obscured by anger toward the dharma.1333According to Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, the gist of this is that the second turn-ing of the wheel of dharma is of definitive meaning and that, in the third turn-ing, there are both expedient and definitive meanings. The definitive meaning inthe third turning can be found in the teaching that all phenomena are withoutnature. Its expedient meaning is comprised by the teachings that talk about theother-dependent nature, self-awareness, a ground consciousness, a self, nonemptypermanence, the cut-off disposition, the absolutely definite dispositions for thethree vehicles, the ultimate existence of three distinct vehicles, and so on, sincetheir explicit and literal words do not hold in actuality.In his Cutting Through Doubts about the Threefold Progression of the Wheels ofDharma,1334Padma Karpo objects to those people who “take the Prajñ›p›ramit›sÒtrasas the basis for identifying them as the second turning as it is described inThe SÒtra That Unravels the Intention, while taking The SÒtra That Unravels theIntentionand others as the basis for the third turning.” On the basis of this mis-taken matching, he says, the proponents of self-emptiness hold the second turn-538The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 538"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"ing to be of definitive meaning and the third to be of expedient meaning, whilethe proponents of other-emptiness give the reverse interpretation of these twoturnings. According to Padma Karpo, this error comes from a more fundamen-tal wrong assumption, that each turning must be based on a distinct set of scrip-tures. For him, both the second and third turnings are primarily based on thePrajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras. He also shows thatThe SÒtra That Unravels the Intentionteaches both Yog›c›ra and Centrism and thus cannot be established as a sÒtra thatteaches only Mere Mentalism.Some people might still wonder, “The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentiondeclares that the second turning is of expedient meaning, while the third is ofdefinitive meaning. So what about this?” The Eighth Karmapa says that this ismerely taught from the perspective of certain disciples. However, since this dis-tinction between expedient and definitive meaning is not the final distinction ofthe Buddha’s intended meaning, there is no invalidation of the above explana-tion, as will be explained immediately below.All three turnings of the wheel of dharma were generally taught to a range ofvarious disciples who all had their individual dispositions for distinct paths andvehicles. Thus, depending on the capacities of these disciples, there are morecoarse and more subtle teachings. In the first turning, the four realities of nobleones were taught; in the second, the lack of nature; and in the third, the threenatures and such. With regard to these three turnings, those who believe in reallyexisting things regard expedient meanings as definitive meanings. Hence, theyaffirm the teachings of definitive meaning to be of expedient meaning and com-ment accordingly on the Buddha’s intention. On the other hand, those who donot have the reference point of really existing things do not take the expedientmeaning to be the definitive meaning. Rather, by seeing the definitive meaningas what it is (nothing but the definitive meaning), they comment on the Buddha’sintention in this way. However, one should be equally aware that, within the entirety of the Buddha’steachings of expedient and definitive meaning in his three progressive cycles ofdharma, there is not a single one that does not serve as a skillful means for cer-tain of the disciples of the three vehicles to attain the higher realms and libera-tion. The only reason teachings of expedient meaning are given is that, due to thedifferent capacities of disciples, it is not possible to teach the definitive meaningto everyone immediately. As The SÒtra of the Treasury of the Thus-Gone Onemakes clear:K›Ÿyapa, it is as follows: Some people may suffer from the unfoundedworry that [they have swallowed some] poison. They say, “I drank poi-son! I drank poison!” and beat their breasts and lament. For their sake,a person who is skilled in medical treatments will act in such a way asThe Distinction between Expedient and Definitive Meaning539Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 539"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"to remove this unreal poison [by, for example, administering anemetic], thereby overcoming the [person’s] belief that stems from sus-pecting [the ingestion of] poison. As a consequence, they are relievedfrom their torments. . . . Likewise, K›Ÿyapa, for naïve beings who arebeset by afflictions, I teach the dharma in an untrue manner.1335N›g›rjuna’sPrecious Garlandsays:In terms of true reality as it is,Neither identity nor identitylessness obtains.Thus, both the views of identity and identitylessnessHave been dispelled by the Great Sage.Just as grammarians introduce you [to grammar]By reading the fundamentals of the alphabet,The Buddha teaches his disciplesThe dharma to the degree they can bear.To some, he teaches the dharmaIn order to eliminate negative actions,And to some, in order that merit is accomplished.To some, [he teaches] based on duality,To some, not based on duality,And to some, the profound that is frightening to the anxious,Emptiness with a heart of compassionThat accomplishes enlightenment.Through seeing this, the learned should let goOf anger toward the great vehicle.In order to accomplish perfect enlightenment,They should have utmost and deepest confidence.1336His Fundamental Versesdeclares:They made the designation “identity”And also taught “identitylessness,”[But] the Buddhas taught as wellThat “there is no such thing as identity or identitylessness.”1337540The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 540"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"firyadeva’s Four Hundred Versesstates:[The Buddha] spoke about “existence, nonexistence,[Both] existence and nonexistence, as well as neither of these two.”But in dependence on the [specific] diseases [to be treated],Does not everything become what we call medicine?1338Given this wide perspective, all the teachings of the Buddha can be establishedas the supreme cause for liberation, since all sÒtras of expedient meaning areimbued with the definitive meaning. The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentionexplains this through four examples:Blessed One, for example, all medicinal powders and elixirs are sup-plemented with dried ginger. Likewise, starting with the lack of natureof phenomena, their lack of arising, their lack of ceasing, that they areprimordial peace and by nature perfect nirv› ̊a, the Blessed One sup-plements all sÒtras of expedient meaning with this definitive meaning.Blessed One, for example, the background of a painting, be it blue, yel-low, red, or white, is uniform throughout the entire picture and alsohighlights what is painted [on it]. Likewise, this teaching of the defin-itive meaning by the Blessed One, ranging from the lack of nature ofphenomena up through them being by nature perfect nirv› ̊a, is uni-form in all sÒtras of expedient meaning and also highlights these expe-dient meanings.Blessed One, for example, when one adds clarified butter to all kindsof dishes, such as cooked grain and cooked meat, they become verypleasing. Likewise, when this teaching of the definitive meaning bythe Blessed One, ranging from the lack of nature of phenomena upthrough them being by nature perfect nirv› ̊a, is added to all sÒtras ofexpedient meaning, it is pleasing, indeed supremely pleasing.Blessed One, for example, space is uniform in everything and does notobstruct any activities. Likewise, this teaching of the definitive mean-ing by the Blessed One, ranging from the lack of nature of phenom-ena up through them being by nature perfect nirv› ̊a, is uniform inall sÒtras of expedient meaning and does not obstruct any activities inthe vehicle of hearers, the vehicle of solitary realizers, or the greatvehicle.1339The Distinction between Expedient and Definitive Meaning541Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 541"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"The SÒtra of the King of Meditative Concentrationsays:If one reflects about a single entity,One will meditate on all of them.The many dharmas of all the Buddhas,However many are taught,Consist in the identitylessness of all phenomena.If those people who are learned in the meaningTrain in this very point,The qualities of the Buddhas will not be difficult to find.1340Some people think that expedient meanings are false and deceiving and thusshould not be relied upon. Also, some Buddhists say, “We are practitioners ofMadhyamaka” or “We just follow the Vajray›na,” and deprecate the rest of theBuddha’s teachings. Clearly, all such attitudes are completely mistaken. In gen-eral, the Buddha never said anything false or deceiving. Moreover, since allexpedient meanings are pervaded by the definitive meaning, they are the meth-ods of becoming introduced to the definitive meaning and realizing it. This isthe same as when it is said that seeming reality is the means and ultimate real-ity is the outcome of this means. Thus, all the turnings of the wheel of dharmaserve as means to cut through the entirety of reference points with regard to theway things appear and teach their true way of being. Consequently, N›g›rjunaand others have said that all approaches of the dharma that were taught by theBuddha have the same intention. As his Commentary on the Mind of Enlighten-mentstates:The teachings of the protector of the worldFollow the intentions and capacities of sentient beings.These [teachings] also differ in many aspectsIn terms of the many means in the world.They may differ in terms of profundity and vastnessOr, in some cases, in both of these characteristics.Although they are taught differently,They are not different in terms of emptiness and nonduality.1341Asaºga declared that those who assert that one group of sÒtras is contradictedby another are rejecting the genuine dharma. In his Sublime Continuum, Maitreyawarns against bringing disorder to the sÒtras as they were presented by the Bud-dha himself:542The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 542"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"There is no one in this world more learned than the Victor.Unlike anybody else, through his omniscience, he knows [everything]without exception as well as true reality just as it is.Hence, one should not cause disorder in the sÒtra collection as presentedby the Seer himself.Since this destroys the approach of the Sage, it causes harm to thegenuine dharma too.1342Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye’s commentary The Unassailable Lion’s Roarexplains that one should not cause disorder in the sÒtra collection as it is pre-sented by the Victor himself as the expedient and definitive meaning by self-fab-ricated statements such as referring to the expedient meaning as the definitivemeaning and the definitive meaning as the expedient, thus explaining it incor-rectly. Since this destroys the Buddha’s own approach of the dharma, it bringsharm to the genuine dharma too, constituting the serious flaw of rejecting thedharma.1343The Seventh Karmapa Chötra Gyamtso says:[All] the teachings of the Victor without exception were spoken byhim as nothing but the definitive meaning. Under the influence of thedisciples’ various ways of understanding [these teachings], they wereunderstood as the expedient meaning and such. Therefore, the pres-entation of expedient and definitive [meaning] is [only made] independence on the disciples. However, from the perspective of thedharma itself, all of it is nothing but the definitive meaning.1344In hisHistory of the Dharma, Pawo Rinpoche states:[The Eighth Karmapa always] taught according to the propensities ofthe disciples and not by just clinging to a single [meaning]. For it ispossible that what is just an expedient meaning for some disciples maybe the definitive meaning for some others and that what is taught asthe expedient meaning in some contexts may be the definitive mean-ing in other contexts. On the one hand, all dharma [teachings] can besaid to be solely of expedient meaning, since they express the inex-pressible. On the other hand, since the words of the Buddha are neverdeceiving and [always] represent the definitive meaning with regard tothose disciples [whom they personally address], all of them can[equally] be said to be of definitive meaning. Nevertheless, [these twoperspectives] are [obviously] not contradictory.1345The Distinction between Expedient and Definitive Meaning543Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 543"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"The Meaning of the Three NaturesWhat then is the meaning of the imaginary nature, the other-dependent nature,and the perfect nature that are taught in so many sÒtras? The Eighth Karmapapresents the Centrist view on this as follows: For example, in dependence on acoiled rope, a snake is only an imputation, because what is imagined as a snakedoes not exist in this coiled rope. With regard to an actual snake, this notion ofa snake is perfectly established, because—conventionally and in terms of depend-ent origination—a snake is established as a snake, and the conventional termthat is used for it is imagined accordingly. Likewise, a real nature of things isimagined in dependence on the unreal bearers of this nature that are conditioned,dependently originating, and other-dependent, while it actually does not exist inthem.1346If it indeed existed, any ultimate real nature could not be something fab-ricated and imputed but would have to exist as some unfabricated and inherentnature. However, fabricated, conditioned phenomena cannot have an unfabri-cated, unconditioned nature of their own. This is just the same as when worldlybeings who do not question things say that the nature of gold exists in somethingthat has the unfabricated nature of gold, such as a refined piece of gold. Theywould not claim that a piece of brass fabricated to resemble gold actually has thenature of gold. Centrists say that this notion of a real nature just demonstratesvalid cognition as acknowledged by others, since The Fundamental Versesstates:Natures are unfabricatedAnd not dependent on anything else.1347In brief, whatever has a real and intrinsic nature cannot possibly be producedby something else, and what is produced by causes and conditions cannot reallyexist. Therefore, the other-dependent nature does not exist as a real thing, sinceit is produced in the manner of dependent origination, just like a reflection in amirror. Still, some Proponents of Cognizance imagine that both the perfectnature, or emptiness, and the other-dependent nature, which is the nature ofcognition, exist in the other-dependent nature itself. However, these two do notexist as the nature of the other-dependent nature in the way that these peopleimagine it, since such real existence is impossible. This means that, when ana-lyzed, unfabricated emptiness (the perfect nature) is not established. Neverthe-less, without analysis, this nature is established as the sphere of the Buddha’swisdom that sees the ultimate that is neither conditioned by other-dependentorigination nor imagined by conceptions. A really established nature of cognitionin the sense of a really existent other-dependent nature is extensively refuted inCentrist texts, since it cannot be established on any level, neither with analysis norwithout analysis.In this sense, one’s mind not moving away from true reality is expressed as544The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 544"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"“Buddhahood.” If the other-dependent nature were real, one should be able toobserve certain characteristics or reference points in the sense of a real entity thatis the other-dependent nature. However, true reality whose sole nature is theemptiness of all phenomena from form up through omniscience is preciselyrevealed through not observing any characteristics or reference points whatsoever.As usual, the Eighth Karmapa does not tire of emphasizing that, from the Cen-trist perspective, all presentations such as “realizing true reality” are merely givenin accordance with the common consensus of others without analysis. It is onlyin such a didactic context that this is said to be the nature of phenomena, whichmeans lacking any nature in the sense of a real entity. Thus, in produced phe-nomena, such as the other-dependent nature, a real nature is not observable. Thisis why the wisdom of Buddhas does not see phenomena as being or having anynature at all, which is the way that true reality is realized.The Karmapa says that this presentation is justified on the worldly level with-out analysis, since it does not contradict common worldly consensus. On theother hand, the presentation of the three natures and a real nature of things bythe Proponents of Cognizance is unjustified on both the ultimate level and theconventional level without analysis, because such a really established nature iscontradictory even to worldly valid cognition. Centrists, when analyzing, do notexpress emptiness, or ultimate reality, as an unconditioned nature. If they wereto express it in this way, their extensive refutations of the existence of any naturewithin either of the two realities would be meaningless. Furthermore, how couldthe very nonexistence of a nature turn into any kind of nature? For Centrists,nothing could be more foolish to proclaim than that. It would be like saying thatthe nonexistence of the horns of a rabbit is the horns of a rabbit.Therefore, when the three natures are presented without analysis, seemingdependent origination is the other-dependent nature, because it is common, con-ventional consensus that it originates in dependence on causes and conditions. Asfor both material things and cognitions that are assumed to constitute real enti-ties, a true way of being, or a nature, they all represent the imaginary nature,because they are superimposed in such ways onto seeming, dependently origi-nating phenomena. Emptiness—ultimate reality—is the perfect nature. This justfollows the common consensus of presentations in mutual dependence: If whatis fabricated and conditioned is presented as the seeming, then what is unfabri-cated and unconditioned has to be presented as the ultimate. This is the expla-nation of the intention of the sÒtras in a way that is merely not contradicting theconformity of the worldly consensus of others.On the other hand, the Proponents of Cognizance say that mistaken imagi-nation or mere cognizance is the other-dependent nature, that apprehender andapprehended are the imaginary nature, and that the other-dependent natureempty of the imaginary is the perfect nature. However, this is not justified,The Distinction between Expedient and Definitive Meaning545Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 545"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"because it contradicts the assertion of three natures. Even conventionally, throughvalid cognition, one cannot observe any imaginary or perfect nature that is suit-able to appear and is other than the mere illusion of the dependently originatingand other-dependent phenomena of the seeming level that are common consen-sus in the world. Moreover, to present the existence of an unchanging perfectnature in these other-dependent phenomena is nothing but an instance of theimaginary nature. For an unchanging perfect nature is only justified in what isnot fabricated by causes and conditions, whereas the assumed existence of sucha perfect nature in other-dependent phenomena that are in fact fabricated bycauses and conditions is just something imaginary.Then what meaning is intended by the statement in the sÒtras that the imag-inary nature does not exist, while the other-dependent nature exists? Withoutanalyzing the notions of existence and nonexistence, one can say that the other-dependent nature exists as illusionlike dependent origination, because this is whatconventionally exists as mere appearances that satisfy as long as they are leftunquestioned. As for the imaginary notions and things that are superimposed byvarious Buddhist and non-Buddhist philosophical systems and do not accordwith normal, common worldly consensus, they do not exist, because they aremerely imputed as something real by these systems, yet they are not even con-ventionally established.The Proponents of Cognizance also say, “The other-dependent nature is sub-stantially established and the imaginary nature exists conventionally, although itdoes not exist ultimately.” This is not justified either. A substantially establishedother-dependent nature is refuted in many Centrist texts, for example, in TheEntrance into Centrism.1348Moreover, the apprehender and the apprehended thatare asserted as the imaginary nature do not exist as something other than thenature of the other-dependent nature, since the other-dependent nature is justwhat is commonly known as conventionally existent dependent origination thatentails fabricated and conditioned functions. But the imaginary idea of the Pro-ponents of Cognizance that the imaginary nature has any sense of an unfabricatednature of certain characteristics of its own is not even conventionally established.SÒtras such as The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentiondeclare that the imaginarynature is the lack of a nature in terms of characteristics, the other-dependentnature is the lack of a nature in terms of arising, and the perfect nature is the ulti-mate lack of a nature.1349According to the Karmapa, Centrists say that the mean-ing of this specific statement is very much justified in the sense in which theproponents of the three natures themselves express it. For, just like the horns ofa rabbit, the imaginary nature is not even conventionally established throughvalid cognition. Just like an illusion, the other-dependent nature lacks any aris-ing through its own makeup but depends on specific causes and conditions. Asfor the perfect nature, since it even conventionally constitutes the nature that is546The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 546"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"emptiness, it is the lack of nature per se. Since this lack of nature is in fact unde-ceiving, it is also established as the ultimate.1350In this vein, Jay›nanda’s Com-mentary on the Entrance into Centrismsays:“[Thus,] the intention of the sÒtras is to be explained [by an under-standing of the presentation of the three natures: the imaginary, theother-dependent, and the perfect nature].”1351[This means that] theexpedient and the definitive meanings of the sÒtras are to be explainedas follows: The sÒtras taught in dependence on the meaning of theimaginary and the other-dependent [nature] are of expedient meaning,and those taught in dependence on the meaning of the perfect [nature]are of definitive meaning.1352Again, all of this is presented merely on the level of seeming reality withoutanalysis. When analyzed, the ultimate is devoid of being either deceiving or unde-ceiving, so there is plenty of room to speculate as to how it could ever be ulti-mately established as undeceiving. Moreover, according to the Proponents ofCognizance, it could not even be the case that the other-dependent nature is thelack of a nature in terms of arising, because they claim arising on the ultimate level.Karmapa Mikyö Dorje says that, in the context of compassionately and skill-fully taking care of individual disciples, even the Buddha taught some expedientmeanings as if they were true reality. Since Centrists just follow this approach, byhaving another basis of intention in mind and for the sake of certain purposes,in many of their texts, they also talk about such topics as knowable objects interms of the five bases, the three natures, and the eight consciousnesses. Forexample, in his Commentary on the Mind of Enlightenment, N›g›rjuna talks aboutthe ground consciousness and latent tendencies:Likewise, the ground consciousnessIs not real but appears as if it were real.When it moves to and fro,It retains the [three] existences.1353The seeming originates from karma and afflictions.Karma originates from the mind.The mind accrues through latent tendencies.If one is free from latent tendencies, one is happy.1354He further says that there are no outer objects and that it is mind that appears assuch objects:The Distinction between Expedient and Definitive Meaning547Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 547"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"Thus, in no way whatsoever is there an outer referentIn the form of a [real] entity.This consciousness that appears in particular waysAppears as the aspect of form.1355He speaks favorably of working with the notion of “mere mind” as a step in theprocess of realizing emptiness:The teachings on the aggregates, constituents, and so onAre for the purpose of stopping the clinging to a self.By settling in mere mind,The greatly blessed ones let go of these too.1356In his Praise to the Inconceivable, he quotes the Buddha as saying that all phe-nomena are “mere conception”:1357Therefore, you have shown that all phenomenaAre “mere conception.”You proclaimed that this conceptionBy which emptiness is conceived does not exist.1358He does not even avoid referring to the three natures. For example, the sametext explicitly equates dependent origination and the other-dependent nature:The seeming is origination from causes and conditionsAnd the other-dependent.This has been proclaimed as the other-dependent,But the ultimate is unfabricated.1359His Praise to the Vajra of Mindidentifies mind as the basis of both cyclic existenceand nirv› ̊a:To obtain mind is enlightenment.The mind is the five [kinds of] beings.The characteristics of both pleasure and sufferingDo not exist in the slightest apart from the mind.1360In brief, what Centrists refute is any notion of real or absolute existence or anintrinsic nature that is attributed to any phenomenon, whether it is materialform, ordinary consciousness, omniscient wisdom, Buddhahood, the DharmaBody, or Buddha nature. Centrists make no difference in this respect between548The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 548"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"refuting the positions of Buddhists and non-Buddhists. They do not even hesi-tate to apply such a critique to anything that is—correctly or incorrectly—under-stood as “Centrism.” Thus, if the teachings on the three natures are explained soas to even slightly suggest real existence, be it on the seeming or the ultimatelevel, be it by the Proponents of Cognizance, so-called Mere Mentalists, or Shen-tong-M›dhyamikas, Centrists will speak up against this. However, when thepresentation of the three natures is understood as the Karmapa explained it above,it is not something that has to be discarded by Centrists but comes down to thesame essential point of ultimate nonreferentiality that is explained in the Centristteachings.Are There Three Vehicles or Only One?Centrists say that, ultimately, there is only a single vehicle, which is the vehicleof becoming a perfect Buddha. This is the definitive meaning. All teachings thatthere are three distinct vehicles—those of the hearers, the solitary realizers, andthe great vehicle of bodhisattvas—are of expedient meaning.1361A sÒtra says:K›Ÿyapa, when all phenomena are realized to be equality, this isnirv› ̊a. It is a single one and not two or three.N›g›rjuna’s Praise to the Incomparablestates:Since the expanse of dharmas is without distinctions,There are no distinctions of the vehicles of the Lord.That you spoke of three vehiclesWas in terms of introducing sentient beings [to the teachings].1362Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrismagrees:Here, other than knowing true reality, there is no endeavor thateliminates all stains.The true reality of phenomena does not depend on any distinctions in terms of manifestation.Also this insight that is the subject of true reality is not disparate.Hence, you taught that the dissimilar vehicles for beings are not distinct.1363Thus, the object to be realized—true reality—is without distinctions. So ifthe path that is to serve as the means to realize true reality does not realize thisfact, it is ineffective in eliminating all stains. When true reality is realized, thereis no distinction in this realization either. Hence, ultimately, there is only a sin-The Distinction between Expedient and Definitive Meaning549Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 549"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"gle Buddhist path and its fruition, although there is no doubt about the tempo-rary existence of three vehicles for different disciples.All who assert that a single vehicle is the definitive meaning agree that, even-tually, hearers and solitary realizers become enlightened in the great vehicle. Asmentioned earlier, some assert that hearers and solitary realizers realize only per-sonal identitylessness, not phenomenal identitylessness. Thus, they assert that,temporarily, there definitely are three vehicles. Nevertheless, in order to attainBuddhahood, everybody must eventually enter the path of the great vehicle. Oth-ers assert that hearers and solitary realizers realize phenomenal identitylessnesstoo. They say that since there are no distinctions in the wisdom that realizes truereality, this true reality must also be the object of the wisdom of hearers and soli-tary realizers. In other words, the very process of eliminating all stains throughsuch wisdom constitutes just a single vehicle, which is the vehicle of becoming aBuddha. When this single process is expressed as three vehicles, this is a statementof expedient meaning. Other than realizing true reality in an unmistaken way,there is no remedy for relinquishing afflictive and cognitive obscurations. There-fore, it is said here that, in general, hearers and solitary realizers also realize truereality, both personal and phenomenal identitylessness. However, due to variouscapacities and means, there are surely differences as to how swiftly different beingsproceed on the path.Some people might wonder, “Does this not contradict the explanation that thepaths of hearers and solitary realizers even represent obstacles for attainingenlightenment?” Persons of lesser capacity are not able to attain enlightenmentwithout having gone through the paths of the lower vehicles as preliminaries.Nevertheless, via these paths of hearers and solitary realizers, they eventuallyattain unsurpassable Buddhahood. It is due to their lesser capacities and theincompleteness of particular skillful means that they first have to enter the pathsof the lower vehicles. In general, since it is possible to eliminate all stains throughbecoming increasingly familiar with ultimate true reality, these lower vehiclesalso are parts of the single vehicle of becoming a Buddha. However, as for per-sons of the sharpest faculties who naturally aspire to what is profound and vast,if they were to go through the paths of the lower vehicles first, it would takethem an unnecessarily long time to attain complete Buddhahood. Thus, it isonly for such persons of the sharpest faculties and in this sense that the paths ofthe lower vehicles are explained as obstacles for attaining enlightenment.The classic example of how the lower vehicles are to be understood from theBuddha’s point of view is described by Candrakırti:Due to the existence of the impurities that produce flaws in beings,The world cannot [directly] approach the Buddha’s profound sphere.550The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 550"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"O Blissfully Gone One, since you possess supreme knowledge,compassion, and the means,And since you promised, “I shall liberate sentient beings,”Therefore, just as a skillful [captain] creates a delightful cityThat allays the fatigue of his crew en route to an island of jewels,So you joined the minds of the disciples to this vehicle, the way of[achieving] peace,And separately taught those who have [thus] purified their minds withregard to voidness.1364From the point of view of the single path to perfect Buddhahood, the vehi-cles of hearers and solitary realizers are for those who cannot make the wholejourney in one stretch so that they may temporarily rest in these vehicles’ resultof a peaceful nirv› ̊a for oneself. At a certain point, however, they are awakenedfrom this blissful state by the Buddhas with a multitude of light rays and calledupon to continue their journey to Buddhahood. Hence, Centrists say that thearhats of hearers and solitary realizers do not possess the final nirv› ̊a that fullyqualifies as such. For, according to those Centrists who assert that arhats realizephenomenal identitylessness, these arhats still have not relinquished the cogni-tive obscurations. According to those who assert that these arhats do not realizephenomenal identitylessness, they have implicitly realized natural enlightenmentor nirv› ̊a, but this realization is limited, since they have not fully perfected theirfamiliarization with natural nirv› ̊a.

There are a number of possiblereasons: worldly motives of a sociopolitical nature, such as competition amongscholars, monasteries, and entire schools for reputation, sponsors, and largeentourages; struggles for political power; or the wish to provide a distinct groupidentity for one’s own school or subschool. However, we should not lose sight ofthe internal spiritual reasons for these controversies, such as aiming at establish-ing the proper view that does not allow for ethical misconduct, or—as Cabezónputs it—what “in our postmodern age, is becoming increasingly difficult for usto recognize: the search for what is true”1366and what that means for our lives.In the light of a genuine “search for truth,” the controversies between greatmasters may be seen as always entailing certain intentions and purposes to fur-ther spiritual progress. Thus, when great masters like Tsongkhapa and the EighthKarmapa debated, they did so based on great compassion in order to assist oth-ers in their own quest for liberation. It needs to be emphasized that, in such a con-text, all arguments in terms of different interpretations or refutations of certainviews are in no way meant as fights leaving a winner and a loser. From their ownperspective, whatever great masters may say and however it may sound to others,they conduct their expositions and debates with an attitude of mutual apprecia-tion1367and concern for the benefit of others. Düdjom Rinpoche’s Nyingma Schoolof Tibetan Buddhismlists many famous masters in both India and Tibet (includ-ing Tsongkhapa and Mikyö Dorje) who came to be criticized by other people andconcludes:If all the doctrines refuted by learned and accomplished Tibetans werefalse, no authentic doctrine would be found. . . .For all these arguments there was certainly a basic intention and spe-cial need; . . .

Fromthe perspective of other people following their controversies, the fact that suchmasters bring up difficult or controversial issues on various levels of the Bud-dhist teachings provides helpful opportunities for others to think these issuesover and, by comparing various takes on them, analyze them on their own, thuseventually reaching their own decisions. In the end, we cannot but rely on our own intelligence and wisdom to figurethings out; just blindly following one of the many views presented by differentmasters and schools will not help. Once Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpochewas debating with some advanced Kagyü students from the Tibetan Institute forHigher Learning in Sarnath, India. They kept asking very eagerly what the “offi-cial” Kagyü position on various issues is. Rinpoche replied every time that it isof no importance what the commonly acknowledged stance in a certain camp is;we have to investigate and find out for ourselves what we personally think is cor-rect. If we look at the controversies between great masters or schools in this way,they can be helpful as models to gauge and refine our personal insights. They maybe compared to lights that signal to the left and right of a dangerous passage inthe ocean to make us aware of rocks, shallow places, and so on.The task to steerthe ship, however, lies with ourselves. The following considerations are thus notto be seen as personal attacks but as means to sharpen our own wisdom.In the presentation of Tibetan Buddhism in the West so far, there is an abun-dance of extensive volumes on the Centrist system of Tsongkhapa and his fol-lowers, so there is no need to go into the details of their positions here. In thischapter, I will not compare each point in Tsongkhapa’s system with what theEighth Karmapa said on them, nor will I attempt anything like an all-inclusiverefutation of Tsongkhapa. Instead I will briefly address some of the most crucialissues raised in the Karmapa’s remarks on Tsongkhapa’s system.When looking at Tsongkhapa’s innovative interpretation of Centrism, it seemsthat he had two main issues in mind. First, he often expressed his concerns aboutwidespread ethical misbehavior in Tibet due to all kinds of wrong views con-cerning the Buddhist teachings, especially on the status of seeming reality. Sec-ond, for him, the entire teaching of the Buddha must be presented as a completelycoherent system in which everything makes sense from beginning to end and inwhich the lower views are incorporated in the higher ones. In particular, in termsof Centrism, these issues are reflected in Tsongkhapa’s opposition to what he554The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 554"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"saw as a nihilistic reading of Consequentialism, to what he deemed the legacy ofthe stereotyped Hvashang view in some Tibetan interpretations of Centrism,and to the Shentong view. At the same time, he made a great effort to validateseeming reality, in particular the law of karmic cause and effect.1369However,Tsongkhapa was definitely not alone in his concern about the serious lack ofproper ethics due to wrong views at that time, this issue being addressed by oth-ers too, among them the Eighth Karmapa1370and Pawo Rinpoche.1371In contrast to Tsongkhapa, for the Karmapa the foremost issue in Centrism isnot one of ultimate versus conventional but of ultimate versus pedagogic. Hefocuses on the soteriological efficacy of the Centrist view rather than its philo-sophical coherence on the level of seeming reality. Thus, his refutations of certaininterpretations by other Tibetan masters are not primarily a matter of streamlin-ing his own position or exposing others’ philosophical and technical inconsis-tencies (though he does not hesitate to do the latter when he sees fit). Rather, hisessential criterion for the correct Centrist view is whether such a view is appro-priate to serve as the basis for the spiritual path to attain liberation from cyclic exis-tence and Buddhahood. Needless to mention, in a view and a path that indeedare the means to achieve such results, proper ethical conduct is indispensable.All critics of Tsongkhapa, including the Eighth Karmapa, agree that manyfeatures of his version of Centrism are novelties that are not found in any Indiansources and see this as a major flaw. However, the main problem is not thatTsongkhapa said something new that was not said before in a tradition that is castin stone and not to be touched. In Buddhism, there always were—and still are—people who said something that was not said in this way before, one of the bestexamples being N›g›rjuna himself. To a certain extent, over the centuries, somethings must be rephrased in order to adapt them to different times and circum-stances, be it in order to introduce the Buddha’s teaching in a different socio-cultural context or to break up various structures of dogmatic traditionalism.Düdjom Rinpoche says:[W]hen the greater vehicle was expounded by master N›g›rjuna, thepious attendants invented negative prophecies about lord N›g›rjunaand, having inserted them in the scriptures, proclaimed that [the sÒtrasof] the greater vehicle were not the transmitted precepts [of the Bud-dha]. When the sublime Asaºga commented upon the final transmit-ted precepts in accord with the intention of the great regent [Maitreya],he and his followers were expelled from the greater vehicle. . . .In Tibet as well, when the venerable Daö Zhönu [Gampopa] taughtthat the abiding nature of reality, as it is explained in the sÒtras, is theGreat Seal, [his critics] maintained that this was not at all the teachingof the Buddha, saying it was “Takpo’s fanciful doctrine.” The all-Major Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations555Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 555"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"knowing Rangjung Dorje [Karmapa III] and Chödrak Gyamtso[Karmapa VII] expounded [the teaching] in accord with the intentionof the final transmitted precepts, but later Mikyö Dorje [KarmapaVIII] and others did not adhere to their view. When master Tölpopadeclared that the ultimate truth was permanent and stable, theTibetans considered him to be merely a S› ̇khya extremist. After thevenerable Tsongkhapa had explained relative appearance to be logi-cally verifiable later scholars assaulted him with HÚ±! and PHA≥![i.e. showered him with derision]. The great pa ̊ ̃ita Zilungpa [⁄›kyaChokden] had to be ejected from the Sakyapa ranks for explainingthat the Analysis of the Three Vows1372was of provisional meaning.Moreover, the all-knowing Great Fifth, having studied and meditatedupon the authentic teachings impartially, was very nearly excludedfrom the Gedenpa [i.e. Gelukpa] order. . . .As long as we have not acquired the pure eye of the doctrine, where -by the truth about doctrines and individuals is seen, it is an unbearablyterrible deed to analyse things through exaggeration and depreciation,saying this is perverse, this is impure, and that artificial.1373As the examples of these accomplished masters show, the mere fact of some-thing being a novelty or being opposed by an existent tradition is not the prob-lem per se.1374Rather, the point here is whether what is said accords with andserves to accomplish the Buddha’s fundamental concern of liberation from cyclicexistence and attaining Buddhood. It should be kept in mind that, for KarmapaMikyö Dorje, this is what lies at the heart of each specific critique he may advanceagainst others. On this basis, his objections in The Chariot of the Tagbo Siddhasare not at all limited to Tsongkhapa and his followers. Rather, he addresses thewhole range of Tibetan views on Centrism in his time, including Dölpopa, ⁄›kyaChogden, Bodong Pa ̊chen, and others. In his text, the Karmapa identifies twomain types of misunderstanding emptiness:13751) misconceiving emptiness as utter nonexistence2) misconceiving emptiness as a real entityThe first is again twofold. There are those groups in Buddhism who deny thescriptures of the great vehicle by saying that the Buddha’s teaching cannot be onemptiness, since this means a view of extinction and total nonexistence. The sec-ond group is identified as certain adherents of the Dzogchen teachings who takeemptiness to mean nonexistence and thus overly deprecate all phenomena. Noneof these two will attain liberation.To misconstrue emptiness as some real entity can also happen in two ways.556The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 556"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"Tsongkhapa and his followers claim that emptiness is an existent and thus theactual nature of entities, which are its supports. Most other Tibetans in this cat-egory, such as Dölpopa and ⁄›kya Chogden, say that only emptiness (which isreally established) exists, whereas, ultimately, all other phenomena of the seem-ing level do not exist. Both of these views are mistaken with regard to the pathto liberation. In The SÒtra Requested by K›Ÿyapa, the Buddha himself warnedagainst any views about emptiness:K›Ÿyapa, those who conceptualize emptiness by focusing on it as empti-ness I explain as those who fall away from this teaching. K›Ÿyapa, thosewho have views about the person that are as big as Mount Meru are bet-ter off than those who proudly entertain views about emptiness. Whyis this? K›Ÿyapa, as emptiness means to emerge from all views, I declarethat those who have views about this very emptiness are incurable.The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºkaagrees:Mah›mati, having this in mind, I explained that “even the views abouta self that are as big as Mount Meru are better than any views aboutemptiness entertained by those who pride themselves on it being exis-tence or nonexistence.” Mah›mati, those who pride themselves on itbeing nonexistence are ruined, and those whose thinking falls into spe-cific and general characteristics . . . are ruined too.1376Tsongkhapa’s Unique Features of ConsequentialismTo compare Tsongkhapa’s and the Karmapa’s views on Centrism, we may startwith three lists by Tsongkhapa that sum up the unique features of Consequen-tialism. The first are “the eight unique features of Consequentialism” (A) in hisElucidation of the Intention:This unique [Consequentialist] system has many [features of a] pure philo-sophical system not shared by other commentators. To state the main ones:1–2) a unique way of refuting [even conventionally] a ground consciousnessand self-awareness that are different in nature from the six collections ofconsciousness3) not accepting that the view of true reality is generated in the continuumof an opponent through autonomous probative arguments4) the necessity to accept outer objects just like accepting consciousness5) that hearers and solitary realizers possess the realization that entities lacka nature6) presenting the clinging to phenomenal identity as an afflictionMajor Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations557Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 557"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"7) disintegratedness being a functional entity13778) a unique way of presenting the three times because of (7)1378This list differs somewhat from “the eight difficult points of The FundamentalVerses” (B) that are found at the very beginning of Gyaltsab Je’s Notes on the EightGreat Difficult Points,1379a record of oral teachings given by Tsongkhapa. Here,A7 and A8 are replaced by two other points:B7) not even conventionally accepting specifically characterized phenomena(Tib. rang mtshan) B8) the mode of a Buddha knowing the extent of the phenomenal world (Tib.ji snyed mkhyen pa).1380In The Essence of Good Explanations, there is a further list of seven “uniquefeatures of Consequentialism” (C).1381The last four points of this list, in dueorder, correspond to points A1, A2, A4, and A3, while its first three points differ:C1) the unique way of Consequentialists identifying and negating the specificobject of negation (Tib. dgag bya), that is, a nature established by its ownspecific characteristics (Tib. rang gi mtshan nyid kyis grub pa’i rang bzhin)C2) both personal and phenomenal identitylessness are taught in the sÒtras ofhearers C3) the unique way of Consequentialists realizing identitylessness and distin-guishing between coarse and subtle forms of clinging to identityWhen all the distinct points from lists A, B, and C are added up, the total isthirteen. What is generally denied by Tsongkhapa’s critics is his claim that Con-sequentialists have a unique philosophical system of their own. In particular,from the three lists, points A7, A8, B8, C1, and C3 are rejected by everybody out-side the Gelugpa tradition.As for list A, Tsongkhapa’s first critic, Rongtön Sheja Künrig, mainly rejectedthe points pertaining to the distinction between Autonomists and Consequen-tialists and whether Centrists have a thesis. His two students Gorampa and ⁄›kyaChogden, as well as Dagtsang Lots›wa, went into great detail in their refutationsof all the points above. Dagtsang Lots›wa lists eighteen major internal contra-dictions in Tsongkhapa’s system.1382Gorampa categorically rejects all eight pointson list A, giving his own sixteen points instead. He denies points A5–A7 in par-ticular, pointing to the fact that A7 corresponds to a notion specific to the non-Buddhist Differentiators, while he affirms that Consequentialists conventionallyaccept a ground consciousness and self-awareness. He also says that the differencebetween Autonomists and Consequentialists lies mainly in their ways of formu-558The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 558"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"lating reasonings for proving the ultimate.1383The Treasury of Knowledgequotes⁄›kya Chogden as declaring that, except for the purely nominal statement thatthe noble ones of hearers and solitary realizers realize phenomenal identitylessness,the other seven points represent a philosophical system that Consequentialistswould not even dream of. He adds that, in particular, the refutation of a groundconsciousness and self-awareness even on the conventional level has no value forunderstanding ultimate reality, or emptiness. So to present such refutations asunique features of Consequentialists is quite an overstatement1384(I think thesame can be said for points A7 and A8 as well). Mipham Rinpoche definitelydisagrees with points A1–A2 and A5–A8. He seems to agree with A3 but is notreally outspoken on A4 and B7–B8.1385Padma Karpo and Pawo Rinpoche largelyaccord with Karmapa Mikyö Dorje.As for list C, from among the three points that are different from the other twolists, C1 and C3 are equivocally denied by all of Tsongkhapa’s critics, while C2is included in their respective treatments of A5.As was made clear so often, there is no question that Karmapa Mikyö Dorjedenies that Consequentialists have any philosophical system of their own, letalone unique distinctive features of such a system. However, his explanations sofar also clearly show that, when the points in Tsongkhapa’s above lists are under-stood as mere pedagogic and expedient conventionalities to counteract wrongviews from the perspective of others, contrary to what one might expect, theKarmapa in fact agrees with more of these points (seven) than he denies (six).In detail, the Karmapa agrees that Consequentialists refute a ground con-sciousness (A1), self-awareness (A2), and specifically characterized phenomenaeven conventionally (B7), since these notions are not common worldly consen-sus but imputations by certain philosophical systems.As for the existence of external objects (A4), the Karmapa does not accept thisas an assertion within a Consequentialist system of its own. However, as explainedabove, he follows verse VI.92 of The Entrance into Centrism:If form does not exist, do not cling to the existence of mind;And if mind exists, do not cling to the nonexistence of form.The Buddha, in the sÒtras of supreme knowledge,Has equally rejected both, while teaching them in the Abhidharma.Thus, whether on the level of no analysis or with analysis, it is not appropri-ate that mind exists while form does not. Under analysis, when outer objectssuch as form have been found not to exist, mind cannot exist either, because thetwo are mutually dependent. Without analysis, by just following commonworldly consensus, both are equally said to exist.Mikyö Dorje’s explanations on phenomenal identitylessness being taught inMajor Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations559Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 559"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"the sÒtras of the hearers (C2), hearers and solitary realizers realizing phenomenalidentitylessness (A5), and the related classification of clinging to real existence orphenomenal identity as an afflictive obscuration (A6) are to be found in detail ear-lier.1386The Karmapa rejects points A3, A7, A8, B8, C1, and C3. From among these,the refutations of A3 and B8 have been explained in detail above. Point A8 isobviously considered a secondary issue and only addressed in passing when negat-ing A7. Points A7, C1, and C3 are refuted in great detail throughout theKarmapa’s commentary and are briefly addressed in the following.These latter points are connected with a number of other features inTsongkhapa’s system, such as seeming reality being established through conven-tional valid cognition; the special identification of the object of negation; differ-ences between Autonomists and Consequentialists as to this object of negationand their realization of emptiness; emptiness being an existent and a nonim-plicative negation; ordinary persons being able to realize the ultimate; the Auton-omist distinction of the seeming into correct and false being allegedly based onphenomena as being established through their own specific characteristics; thenotion of a personal self that is established through valid cognition and serves asthe support for the continuity of karmic actions and their results; and the incor-poration of the epistemological system of Dign›ga and Dharmakırti into Con-sequentialism.Further peculiarities of Tsongkhapa’s version of Centrism include his differ-ent interpretation of the two realities, the approach to the analytical meditationon emptiness, the redefinition of autonomous reasoning along with its rejectionby Consequentialists, and that even Consequentialists have a thesis and a systemof their own. These have been dealt with above.Establishment through Conventional Valid CognitionAccording to Tsongkhapa and subsequent Gelugpa scholars, the task of Conse-quentialists lies not only in refuting false notions that obscure the nature of ulti-mate reality but also in validating all phenomena of cyclic existence and nirv› ̊a.Otherwise, Consequentialists would fall into the extreme of nihilism. Moreover,without conventionally existing phenomena, their real nature—emptiness—would also not exist. However, since emptiness is firmly asserted as an existentby Tsongkhapa, that which bears the nature of this existent emptiness must alsosomehow exist. This leads to the assertion that conventional phenomena are“established by conventional valid cognition” that certifies their causal efficiency,especially in terms of karmic actions and their results. Clearly, this approach isbased on introducing into Consequentialism the logico-epistemological methodsof Dign›ga and Dharmakırti, who establish the ultimate existence of phenomenaby using the same criterion.560The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 560"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"Generally speaking, if a given philosophical system differentiates the two levelsof seeming and ultimate reality, then in whatever way it does so, once it speaksabout seeming, relative, or deceiving phenomena, it must also accept this to meanthat such phenomena are precisely something that is not established. Otherwise,why differentiate between two such levels of reality in the first place? Tsongkhapaclaims the opposite when he says that even Consequentialists accept seemingreality as being established through conventional valid cognition. However, eitherphenomena are established as something or they are not. If seeming phenomenaare analyzed by reasoning that investigates for the ultimate and are seen to be notreally or ultimately established, this means that they are not established on eitherlevel of reality. If something cannot be found on the level of true insight into thenature of phenomena, how can it be found on the level of delusion? This isexpressed in The Entrance into Centrism:Likewise, although all entities are empty,They arise from what is empty.Since they lack a nature in both realities,They are neither permanent nor extinct.1387So what is gained by putting so much effort into establishing illusory appear-ances only to find out through analyzing for the ultimate that they are not estab-lished anyway? By doing so, one is left with purely nominal entities, like theHindu notion of an ›tman, and just engages in more reifications rather thanworking on recognizing illusions for what they are. As shown above, the importance of not analyzing seeming appearances isrepeatedly expressed by all kinds of Centrists, particularly Candrakırti. After all,the whole point of Centrism is to show that illusory seeming appearances lack anykind of ontological status in order to put an end to our clinging to them. TheKarmapa says that the floating hairs that appear to people with blurred vision donot even conventionally exist for those with normal vision. However, in order toput an end to the former’s clinging to the real existence of floating hairs, the lat-ter may say, “These floating hairs may appear to you, but they are without anynature.” In the same way, when the seeming is analyzed, it is seen to be com-pletely free from all discursiveness and reference points. It does not even con-ventionally appear for the meditative equipoise of noble ones. Still, exclusivelyfrom the perspective of others, the noble ones, by not rejecting the mere con-ventionalities of phenomena from form up through omniscience, expedientlyrefer to the seeming by pointing out its lack of nature. The reason they do so isprecisely that this is the means to put an end to all clinging to any kind of realexistence that is imputed by both worldly people and philosophers onto thesemere appearances as they display from the perspective of mistaken minds.

From the perspective of others, what appears for ordinary beingsas seeming reality is addressed but not reified. However, from their own per-spective, what should be established by those who analyze for the actual natureof things or noble ones in meditative equipoise, if they do not find any referencepoints in the first place?Moreover, with phenomena being established on the seeming level but not atall ultimately, the two realities are very far apart, in fact contradictory. So howcan there ever be the unity of the two realities that is supposed to be the veryessence of the Centrist view? Thus, the Eighth Karmapa, Pawo Rinpoche, andPadma Karpo insist that neither of the two realities can be established by itself,not even conventionally, and they emphasize their essential unity.There is a further inconsistency here. On the one hand, Autonomists are(falsely) accused of asserting that the phenomena of correct seeming reality areestablished through their own specific characteristics, while Consequentialists aresaid to vehemently reject this assertion together with the distinction of the correctand false seeming. On the other hand, the very similar notion of seeming realitybeing established through conventional valid cognition is introduced into Con-sequentialism (to which it is completely alien). The question is how the phe-nomena of seeming reality can be validly established as conventionally existent, ifthey are not so established through some specific characteristics of their own thatallow for distinguishing them from other such validly established phenomena.A further problem lies in the Gelugpa identification of the seeming as beingequivalent to the two kinds of obscurations, which in turn are identified as theobject of negation of the path. So if the seeming, obscurations, and the object ofnegation are equivalent, what could possibly be established as valid in obscura-tions and that which is to be negated as the root of cyclic existence? What sensedoes it make to validly establish obscurations and what is to be relinquished? Ifobscurations and the object of negation could be validly established, why andhow should they be obscurations and be negated? In fact, if they are validly estab-lished, they are something that withstands analysis and thus cannot be negated orrelinquished. After all, the nature of obscurations and what is to be relinquishedis precisely their lack of being established as anything, and liberation means noth-ing but realizing this lack. So trying to establish obscurations and what is to beeliminated on the path just means working against this realization.1388The Object of NegationIn general, Tsongkhapa makes a distinction between “existence” ( conventionalexistence) and “real existence” or “being really established” (Tib. bden grub). Onthis basis, he emphasizes the correct identification of the object of negation inCentrism and further differentiates between “the object of negation of reasoning”562The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 562"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"and “the object of negation of the path.” He says that the object of negation ofreasoning in all Centrist texts is an object’s “real existence” in the sense of it beingestablished through its own nature, that is, its own way of being, be it a really exis-tent person or a phenomenon. This “real existence” is not a knowable object; itis a nonexistent. However, all knowable objects, which “exist” as being estab-lished through conventional valid cognition, are neither the objects of negationthrough reasoning nor invalidated through the valid cognition of a reasoningconsciousness, because otherwise one would fall into a great extreme of extinc-tion. The object of negation of the path is the ignorance that clings to such realexistence (in other words, the two obscurations). This ignorance is a knowableobject, which is to say, an existent.In his texts, Tsongkhapa deals mainly with the object of negation of reason-ing. He emphasizes that, for example, a book (the basis of negation) is not emptyof this book (a nature of its own), but that a book is empty of real existence orof being really established (the object of negation). Thus, the basis of negationand the object to be negated in it are different. This, Tsongkhapa says, is theactual meaning of “phenomena being empty of themselves” that is taught in bothsÒtras and Centrist texts. In other words, phenomena that are established throughconventional valid cognition are not empty of a nature of their own but of some-thing else. This, however, flies in the face of what Candrakırti (whom Tsong -khapa claims as his chief authority) says in his Lucid Words:One may wish to not deny all [phenomena]. Then, however, no mat-ter in which way one may have focused on these entities, how shouldthey become emptiness? Hence, to say that “the meaning of emptinessis not the meaning of lacking a nature” is definitely a rejection ofemptiness. Having rejected it in this way, due to the [ensuing] karmic[result] of being deprived of the dharma, one will go to the lowerrealms.1389In search of scriptural authority in Indian Centrist texts for this presentation,Tsongkhapa runs into a further problem, because the topic of identifying anobject of negation (let alone differentiating it in terms of reasoning and the path,or Autonomists and Consequentialists) was never even an issue in these texts.Therefore, Tsongkhapa cannot (and does not) quote any texts by N›g›rjuna,firyadeva, Buddhap›lita, or Candrakırti. What does he do? His Elucidation of theIntentionoffers another one of his highly inventive solutions by quoting ⁄›ntideva:As for this determination of phenomena lacking reality, if one doesnot properly know how the mode of being really established is andwhat the mode of clinging to reality is, one certainly misses the viewMajor Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations563Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 563"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"of true reality. As The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Lifesays:Without referring to an imputed entity,One cannot apprehend the lack of this entity.1390Through this, [⁄›ntideva] says that if the imputed entity, that is, thegenerality of the object of negation, does not properly appear to themind, the nonexistence of this object of negation cannot be properlyapprehended. Hence, if the aspects of [both] real existence (which iswhat is nonexistent) and the object of negation of which something isempty do not appear to the mind just as they are, it is impossible toascertain the nature of the lack of reality and emptiness.1391This is yet another case of Tsongkhapa taking a quotation totally out of con-text and reinterpreting it in the light of his own agenda, here his own ideas aboutthe object of negation. The lines he quotes from ⁄›ntideva’s text have nothing todo with identifying the object of negation as Tsongkhapa understands it andwhat he claims ⁄›ntideva as intending to say here. Rather, ⁄›ntideva’s point inthis verse and its context is that the negation of an imputed entity is as unreal asthat very entity. The imputation of the nonexistence of an entity must refer to apreceding imputation of that entity itself. Since both of these imputations—anentity and its negation—are thus mutually dependent, the next two lines of thisverse say that they are equally delusive, which is illustrated in the following verseby the illusory death of one’s child in a dream. This is also what all Indian com-mentaries explain.1392To address Tsongkhapa’s identification of the object of negation, the Karmapafirst asks whether, according to Tsongkhapa’s system, a vase is empty of its ownnature. Tsongkhapa cannot say that it is not empty of its own nature, because heasserts that his way of explaining Centrism is the Centrism that propounds the lackof nature. So, if the vase is empty of its own nature, is its own nature then the entitythat has the defining characteristics of having a round belly and a flat bottom andof performing the function of carrying water, or is it its real existence that is estab-lished through its own way of being? It is impossible that the vase’s own nature isthe latter, since (as Tsongkhapa agrees) such does not exist among knowableobjects. However, if the vase’s own nature is the former, it follows that Tsongkhapais not at all someone who propounds the Centrism that says that all phenomenalack a nature of real entities for two reasons: As accepted, the vase’s own nature isthe entity that has the defining characteristics of having a round belly and a flatbottom and of performing the function of carrying water, and (as he claims above)this entity is not empty of the nature of this entity (but of real existence).Moreover, the Buddha has identified the definitive meaning many times as564The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 564"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"solely that a vase is empty of a vase, while a vase being empty of something otherdoes not qualify as the vase’s emptiness. For example, in the collection of sÒtrasin The Jewel Mound, it is said:Form is not empty through the emptiness of form, but this very formis emptiness.If a vase is not empty of its own nature, it becomes established. If that isaccepted, the vase is something found under analysis through reasoning. If thatis also accepted, such a vase must be either one of its infinitesimal particles or theircollection. As for the latter possibility, if even the followers of lower Buddhistphilosophical systems do not accept that the coarse object of a vase can with-stand analysis through reasoning, how could any Centrist accept this? It is alsonot suitable that one of its infinitesimal particles is the vase, because such a par-ticle can never be established as a coarse object.If a table is different from its real existence, in terms of affecting the clingingto this table, what does it do to the table itself if one negates some hypothetical“real existence” that is different from the table and is even said to be nonexistent?This leaves the table fully intact and in fact makes it an ultimate reality, becauseit is still found after the reasoned analysis for the ultimate1393(that is, the nega-tion of real existence that is to be negated and other than the table). Therefore,to first set up some phantom notion of “real existence” different from the “tablethat is established through valid cognition” and then to negate this constructdoes nothing to stop one from taking this very table to be a real table and con-tinuing to reify it as such. To be sure here, it is fine to say that a table is emptyof real existence if that is understood as equivalent in meaning to a table beingempty of itself. The problem appears only if the table’s real existence is taken tobe something other than this very table.This is what Tsongkhapa’s critics call a “hornlike object of negation”: If you firstfix a horn on the head of a rabbit and then remove it again, the rabbit might won-der what you are doing, but your whole maneuver affects neither the rabbit’s exis-tence nor your taking the rabbit for a rabbit. This is precisely why it is said thatsuch an approach to the object of negation is not suitable for relinquishing thereifying clinging to persons and phenomena and thus does not lead to liberationfrom cyclic existence. Through negating the hornlike object of negation called“real existence” with regard to a table, we will neither relinquish the clinging to thereality of this table nor realize its ultimate nature. Even great masters from the Gel-ugpa tradition, such as Janggya Rölpay Dorje1394(1717–1786), Dendar Lharamba1395(born 1759), and of course Gendün Chöpel, were not unaware of this problem. AsJanggya Rölpay Dorje says in his Song on the View, Called Recognizing the Mother:Major Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations565Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 565"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"Nowadays, some of our great luminariesCling to terms such as solid, real existence.Hence, by firmly setting up quivering appearances in their own place,They are seen to search for something hornlike to be negated.In the face of the Mother free from obscurations,There is not a word on these fluctuating, quivering [appearances] beingexistent.If they keep explaining lots and lots without hitting negation’s essentialpoint,I am afraid this old mother will run away from them.1396In other words, our clinging to personal and phenomenal identities does notconcern some abstract, nonexistent notion of “real existence” but what appearsright in front of our eyes, which is what we then reify as tables, books, or persons.“Real existence” never appears for any kind of consciousness, since it is not aknowable object. Also, to identify and negate such an extrinsic, abstract notionas the Centrist object of negation openly contradicts both the sÒtras and theIndian Centrist treatises. As The Prajñ›p›ramit› SÒtra in Hundred ThousandLinessays:SubhÒti asked: “How should bodhisattvas train to understand that allphenomena are empty of their own specific characteristics?”The Blessed One said: “Form should be seen as empty of form, feel-ing empty of feeling, and so on.”SubhÒti asked: “If everything is empty of itself, how does the bod-hisattvas’ engagement in the perfection of knowledge take place?”The Blessed One answered: “Such engagement in the perfection ofknowledge is non-engagement.”1397Candrakırti explicitly clarifies in his autocommentary on The Entrance into Cen-trism:Here, one speaks about emptiness [as the fact] that the eyes and so on[are empty] of these very eyes and so on. This makes it completelyclear that [this is] the emptiness of a nature, whereas it is not an empti-ness of one not existing in an other, [such as] “the eye is empty, since566The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 566"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"it lacks an inner agent” or “it is empty of the nature of apprehender andapprehended.”1398What is said here is that the eye and such are empty of themselves—that is, theylack a nature in the sense of being empty of a nature of their own—and that thisis their nature. That the eye is empty of a nature of its own does not mean thatthe eye is empty of a nature that is something other than this very eye itself.To the contrary, Tsongkhapa says above that phenomena, such as a table, arenot empty of themselves or their own nature but empty of an other object ofnegation (real existence) and that this qualifies as phenomena being empty oftheir own nature. However, from this, it absurdly follows that the emptiness ofa table being empty of the horns of a rabbit is the emptiness of this table beingempty of its own nature. The reason is as follows: Despite a table not being emptyof a table, the emptiness of the table being empty of the object of negation thatis real existence is said to be the emptiness of this table being empty of its ownnature. At the same time, this object of negation and the horns of a rabbit areequal in not existing among knowable objects. If this is accepted, then preciselybecause of such acceptance, it follows both that the horns of a rabbit are thenature of the table and that the table’s emptiness of the horns of a rabbit is theactual true nature of the table.The main reason for Tsongkhapa’s vehement refusal to say that the eye isempty of itself lies in his unique take on avoiding the two extremes, which is hisconcern that seeming reality becomes extinct or invalidated if a phenomenon isempty of that very phenomenon. So he claims to avoid the extreme of extinctionthrough the appearance of conventionally valid phenomena and the extreme ofpermanence through positing these phenomena as being empty of real existence.This is his interpretation of the fundamental Centrist statement that “all phe-nomena are neither existent nor nonexistent.” For Tsongkhapa, this means thatphenomena are not nonexistent conventionally and not existent ultimately. How-ever, almost all of his critics take this statement to mean that it is the nature ofall phenomena to be primordially and utterly free from any reference points interms of existence or nonexistence.On the level of no analysis, the Karmapa says, when Centrists speak with peo-ple who do not like to talk in a manner consistent with the principle of depend-ent origination, for the purpose of removing such people’s fear of this principleand on the level of the expedient meaning, Centrists speak about existence andnonexistence. When they speak with people who like to talk in a manner con-sistent with dependent origination, Centrists speak about the utter freedom fromall discursiveness in terms of existence and nonexistence. At the time when Cen-trists analyze, since nothing is established as anything whatsoever, they do notMajor Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations567Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 567"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"conceive of or express anything whatsoever. This is comparable to when a mirageappears as water: Concerning this “water” and its emptiness, one cannot provideany factually concordant, conventional expressions of the existence or nonexis-tence of the water’s emptiness in this “water.” Therefore, all claims of qualifyingform as being established through conventional valid cognition, not being emptyof its own nature, and not being the object of negation of reasoning are in con-tradiction with what the Buddha taught many times. As thePrajñ›p›ramit›sÒtrassay:In the perfection of knowledge, no [notions] such as “form is perma-nent” or “form is impermanent” are observable.

Igno-rance is free of any nature. Any phenomenon that does not have anature does not exist as an entity. What does not exist as an entity isnot established. What is not established neither arises nor ceases. Whatneither arises nor ceases cannot be labeled as “something in the past.”It is not something in the future, nor can it be called “what occurs inthe present.” What is unjustified [as existing] in the three times has nei-ther name, nor defining characteristics, nor signs, nor can it be desig-nated. . . . Ignorance is ultimately not observable. A phenomenon thatis ultimately not observable cannot be designated. It cannot be desig-nated even conventionally. It cannot be expressed. Blessed One, whatis merely nominal is not actual.The Karmapa clearly says that both the object of negation of reasoning and theobject of negation of the path are nothing but the innate clinging to an intrinsicnature or identity of persons and phenomena. This is explained clearly and indetail in The Entrance into Centrismand its autocommentary. However, he says,despite this fact, Tsongkhapa and others still search for an object of negationsomewhere else. They are like a thief on the run who sees a hiding place in the568The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 568"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"forest on the mountain on the far side of a valley and still keeps searching formaterials to cover himself on the lawn on the hither side.

However—and this cannot be saidtoo often—the actual target in the context of negating the two identities is theclinging to these identities on the subject side. In other words, the object of nega-tion in the sense of what has to be stopped is a mistaken cognition, a wrong con-ception that apprehends something nonexistent as existent. Since there is noactual object of negation on the objective side, there is nothing to be relinquishedthere. So “negating an identity” is just another expression for the process of let-ting go of our subjective clinging to what appears to us as being existent in andas itself. With the realization that an object has no nature of its own, the subjectthat holds on to this object dissolves naturally.Tsongkhapa as Shentongpa and RealistMaybe the worst critique of Tsongkhapa’s view on the relation between the basisof negation and the object of negation is that the Karmapa identifies it as beingnothing but a type of “other-emptiness” (shentong), the view that the Gelugpasthemselves so vehemently reject. Clearly, in their view, a book (the basis of nega-tion) is not empty of itself but of something other, that is, real existence (theobject of negation), while this book itself is left untouched as a remainder afterthe analysis. This means moreover that the book itself as the basis of being emptyof something other is not empty. For if a phenomenon is empty of somethingother than itself, how should that phenomenon itself become emptiness throughthat? If such were the case, then, based on the twenty emptinesses, the Buddhawould only have to explain the notion of other-emptiness and not explain self-emptiness, because this very other-emptiness has the meaning of self-emptiness.In the same vein, the Karmapa identifies this as the limited “emptiness of onenot existing in an other,” which is regarded by all Tibetan schools as one of theMajor Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations569Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 569"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"grossest misconceptions of emptiness that is to be rejected. As The SÒtra of theArrival in Laºkasays:This emptiness of one [not existing in] an other, Mah›mati, is veryinferior, and you should abandon it.1400Consequently, for the Karmapa, Tsongkhapa’s understanding of emptiness basedon his object of negation even puts him into the camp of realists. He shows how,in the other Buddhist philosophical systems below Centrism (according toTibetan doxography), specific objects of negation are progressively negated, whilea certain unnegated remainder is left in all of them.For those Buddhists who assert that there is a real person, the bases of empti-ness are all phenomena, that is, the five aggregates and this person. These arethen said to be empty of the extremes of permanence (such as a permanent, sin-gle, and independent self as imputed by non-Buddhists) and extinction (thenonexistence of karma, causes and results, or former and later lifetimes).For those Followers of the Great Exposition who do not accept a real person,the bases of emptiness are all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena in thethree times (the five aggregates, eighteen constituents, and twelve sources). Theseare empty of the extremes of permanence and extinction, such as a person thatis imputed by those who assert a real person. However, all knowable objects thatare empty of these extremes exist by their nature.For the SÒtra Followers, the present aggregates, constituents, and sources as thebases of emptiness are empty of the extremes of permanence and extinction, theself as imputed by non-Buddhists and those Buddhists who assert a real person,and also of the imputations of the Followers of the Great Exposition (such as sub-stantially established past and future phenomena). However, the partless, infin-itesimal particles of matter and the partless, infinitesimal moments ofconsciousness are said to be real.For “the Real Aspectarian Mere Mentalists,” the basis of emptiness is the pres-ent moment of awareness including the aspect of its object. This is empty of allkinds of personal and phenomenal identities that are imputed by non-Buddhistsand hearers. However, the other-dependent nature and the nondual, self-lumi-nous self-awareness that are empty of all the above are asserted to be not emptyof the perfect nature.For “the False Aspectarian Mere Mentalists,” the basis of emptiness is theother-dependent mere experience of luminosity and awareness. This is empty ofall kinds of identities as imputed by non-Buddhists and hearers and also of allstains of the aspects imputed by the Real Aspectarians. However, both the sub-stantially established, other-dependent mere cognizance that is empty of all theabove and the perfect nature (the true reality of nonduality) are asserted to be ulti-570The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 570"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"mately existent as mere cognizance and as being neither the same nor differentfrom each other.Tsongkhapa holds that entities established through conventional valid cogni-tion (the bases of negation) are empty of the entity that is the object of negationof reasoning. However, he asserts that emptiness itself exists as being establishedin these bases of negation.Thus, the Karmapa says, with regard to all of the above kinds of emptiness asunderstood by these realists, the respective imputed phenomena about whichthey speak are empty of a nature of their own, but the respective bases of empti-ness are all asserted to be real. Also, the emptiness of these bearers of emptinessis said to exist in a way of neither being one in entity with its bearers nor beingexpressible as exactly the same as them or something other. Hence, both thenature of phenomena and the bearers of this nature are not empty of a nature oftheir own, while they are empty of an object of negation that is something other.Hence, just like the kinds of emptiness of non-Buddhists, the above types ofemptiness represent only limited and nominal types of emptiness. They are notthe actual emptiness that is suitable as the foundation for the path to liberation.For, if both the nature of phenomena and its bearers really exist, it is not appro-priate to eradicate the mental states that apprehend them as real. And if these reifi-cations are not eradicated, the seeds of afflictive and cognitive obscurations cannotbe eliminated.By placing Tsongkhapa in the category of realists with a soteriologically insuf-ficient understanding of emptiness, the Karmapa implies that Tsongkhapa’s sys-tem does not qualify as Madhyamaka in this crucial respect, which is after allnothing less than the very pith of Centrism. Taking into account the variousadditional points in Tsongkhapa’s system that Mikyö Dorje and other Tibetanmasters reject, it is natural that a number of these masters would raise seriousdoubts as to whether the Gelugpa version of Madhyamaka is still to be consid-ered Centrism, let alone Consequentialism.In general, the Karmapa says, any meditation or conduct based on the notionof an isolated nature of phenomena that is not connected to anything that bearsthis nature is not appropriate as either the foundation for the path to liberationor the remedy for obscurations. For any meditation or conduct based on a natureof phenomena that is unrelated to these phenomena cannot relinquish the twoobscurations of clinging to the reality of these very phenomena as the seemingbearers of this nature. In terms of such a disconnected nature of phenomena, itdoes not matter whether it is said to be a nonentity that is a nonimplicative nega-tion (as held by Tsongkhapa) or a permanent ultimate entity (as maintained byDölpopa and others). Both are equally soteriologically ineffective.

O son ofgood family, all phenomena are naturally empty. Through meditatingon their being empty, bodhisattvas see that all phenomena are empty.In contrast to all the above misconceptions of emptiness, according to MikyöDorje, Autonomists and Consequentialists understand emptiness in a way thatis soteriologially effective.Autonomists say that, if investigated through reasoning that analyzes for theultimate, there is nothing to be found at all, be it a basis of emptiness or proper-ties of which this basis is empty, the fact of being empty or not being empty, thenature of phenomena, or the bearers of this nature. By conventionally takingmere illusionlike appearances as the bases of emptiness, Autonomists say that,ultimately, these appearances are empty of all properties that may be imputed byBuddhist and non-Buddhist realists. They assert that all phenomena are emptyof a nature of their own. From the perspective of correct reasoning and the med-itative equipoise of the noble ones of the great vehicle, all discursiveness andcharacteristics are at utter peace. Hence, the Autonomists’ understanding ofemptiness is greatly superior to any of the realist notions of emptiness above andis definitely suitable as the foundation for liberation and the remedy for bothkinds of obscurations.Consequentialists say that all phenomena are primordially not established asany reference points for discursiveness, be it the four extremes, the eightextremes, being empty or not empty, real or delusive. It is just nonreferentialitythat is conventionally labeled “emptiness,” “true reality,” and so on. This is suit-able as the foundation for liberation and the remedy for the two obscurations,since both afflictive and cognitive obscurations originate from the reification ofentities. Once yogic practitioners realize that all phenomena are primordiallyfree from all discursiveness, the entirety of reifying clinging to real entities is putto an end.1401In summary, in terms of its soteriological efficacy, the Eighth Karmapa con-siders Tsongkhapa’s presentation of the object of negation and emptiness to bea form of realism outside of Centrism and, in terms of doxographical ranking, tobe located between Mere Mentalists and Autonomists.572The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 572"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"Do Autonomists and Consequentialists Have a Different Object of Negation?Tsongkhapa explains in detail how Autonomists and Consequentialists differ inthe subtlety of their objects of negation and thus have a different realization ofemptiness.

These are considered to be more or less equivalent, but—as Tauscher (1995) pointed out—are divided into two groups. The first group ofthree consists of the following:1) being really established or really existent (Tib. bden par grub pa)2) being ultimately established (Tib. don dam par grub pa)3) being truly established (Tib. yang dag par grub pa)These three terms refer to any kind of absolute existential status of phenomenaand imply their complete independence of causes and conditions.

In particular, (4) and(6) indicate an intrinsic mode of existence of objects independent of their cog-nitions.It is said then that Consequentialists understand all six notions to be theirobject of negation, whereas Autonomists take only the first three. Hence, this dif-ference is again just a consequence of Tsongkhapa’s well-known claim thatAutonomists conventionally assert appearances as being established through theirown specific characteristics.1403From the Gelugpa Consequentialist point of view,this entails a certain degree of existence in an absolute sense and thus constitutesthe subtle difference in the object of negation between Autonomists and Conse-quentialists, that is, (1) being really existent versus (6) being established by itsnature. This difference is said to entail a further distinction between coarse andsubtle forms of personal and phenomenal identity in Centrism, which may bebriefly outlined as follows:Major Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations573Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 573"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"Coarse selfSubtle selfCoarse ph.

From among the four extremes of existence, nonexistence, both, and nei-ther in Centrist reasonings, does the Consequentialists’ special object of negationcorrespond to the first extreme of existence? If that is affirmed, any understand-ing of emptiness that results from the negation of just this one extreme must beonly partial, since the remaining three extremes, particularly that of nonexis-tence, are not negated. Does that mean that emptiness is either nonexistent, bothexistent and nonexistent, or something that is neither? In any case, statisticallyspeaking, 75 percent of the possible extremes have not been negated, so howcould this be called freedom from extremes? On the other hand, if this specialobject of negation is not the first extreme of existence, which of the others wouldit be? None of them looks like a promising candidate. And what could a fifthextreme beyond the usual four extremes be? Moreover, a fifth extreme wouldblow up the entire Centrist approach to reasoning in terms of mutually exclusiveand exhaustive possibilities to be negated. If Centrist negations cannot be limitedto the four extremes, one inevitably ends up in an infinite regress, since if thereis a fifth extreme, one can easily find a sixth, and so on.1406So if the Consequentialist object of negation and the resulting realization areindeed superior to what Autonomists negate and realize, this would either meanthe elimination of a further extreme or reference point or, since Autonomistsequally and thoroughly negate all four extremes and cultivate the freedom fromall reference points, it would mean that Consequentialists revert from this free-dom from all reference points to again having a reference point. What more than574The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 574"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"all reference points can one possibly eliminate? And what more is emptiness? AsSakya Pa ̊ ̃ita says, “The very attempt to go higher or beyond the freedom fromall reference points would just mean falling out of nonreferentiality by inevitablycreating a reference point again.”Once Autonomists realize the freedom from all extremes, there is no point inmaking a distinction between them and Consequentialists in terms of the latter’sobject of negation being more subtle and their realization of emptiness beingsuperior. Either Autonomists reject the four extremes and thus realize the free-dom from reference points or they do not and consequently should not becounted as Centrists, for this is precisely what Centrism is about. If Autonomistsindeed had an object of negation that is not as all-inclusive as that of Conse-quentialists, it can only mean that they do not reject all four extremes and thusdo not become Buddhas. So why would they still be counted as Centrists? Inother words, such an assumed fundamental inferiority of Autonomists makes theAutonomist-Consequentialist distinction as a subdivision of a single school morethan questionable. And if they do not belong to the same school due to sub-stantial differences, then doxographically one should speak of five rather thanfour Buddhist philosophical systems. This, however, contradicts the Gelugpas’own doxographical scheme.Similar problems apply to the notion of a special Consequentialist object ofnegation with regard to a personal self as outlined above. For this means that allfollowers of other Buddhist philosophical systems do not actually realize per-sonal identitylessness. Consequently, all lower vehicles and philosophical systemsexcept Consequentialism are teachings that are inefficient for relinquishing theclinging to a personal self, which means that it was pointless for the Buddha toteach them. This leads to the further conclusion that hearers and solitary realiz-ers do not even attain liberation from cyclic existence, let alone realize phenom-enal identitylessness. Moreover, it is self-contradictory to accept, on the one hand,that the wisdom that realizes the sixteen aspects of the four realities of the nobleones is yogic valid perception (that is, the unmediated cognitive mode of realiz-ing identitylessness) and, on the other hand, that this wisdom (which is the onlydirect mode of realizing personal identitylessness that is explained in the scripturesof hearers and solitary realizers) is not able to uproot the innate clinging to per-sonal identity.According to Tsongkhapa, the Consequentialist system also asserts a personalself that is apprehended by the innate clinging to a self (and is said to be differ-ent from the personal self that is the object of negation of reasoning). This firstkind of self is not to be negated but serves as the support for karmic actions andtheir result. However, if such a personal self existed, then the wisdom that real-izes identitylessness would not engage the actual nature of its object, while themode of apprehension of the innate clinging to identity would be unmistaken.Major Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations575Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 575"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"Moreover, Tsongkhapa thus contradicts his own claim to be a Centrist pro-pounding that all phenomena are identityless.Tsongkhapa’s emphasis on the distinction between “existence” on the onehand and “real existence” or “being established by its nature” on the other alsoentails a practical problem on the path, since he himself says that this distinctionis so subtle that it cannot be grasped by ordinary beings but only by noble onesfrom the path of seeing onward. In other words, only at this point is it possibleto differentiate between the basis of negation and the object of negation. If thebasis of everyone’s progress on the path is a distinction that is said to be notice-able only to highly advanced practitioners, then for a long time (that is, duringall of the paths of accumulation and junction, which are usually said to take atleast one infinite eon), the vast majority of practitioners can have no chance topractice this correctly. And if they cannot practice properly, how should theyever get to this resultant, advanced stage where they are finally supposed to be ableto see what they should have been practicing all along? What should a beginnerthink of an instruction that says, “It is absolutely crucial for you to clearly makethis distinction to properly progress on the path, but there is no way you will getit”? This sounds like the well-known statement, “You have no chance, but use it.”Moreover, Tsongkhapa’s statement that ordinary beings cannot grasp this sub-tle but all-decisive distinction evidently contradicts his other claim that ordinarybeings canrealize actual emptiness.Also, by focusing on the fictitious construct of real existence rather than onCentrism being about eradicating our very sense of any reference points of exis-tence, nonexistence, and so on, Centrist reasonings and negations almostinevitably turn into mere intellectual exercises of negating something “out there”that is totally unrelated to our subjective experience of instinctively taking thingsto be real and thus developing attachment and aversion.1407Does Emptiness Exist?Tsongkhapa and his followers insist that emptiness is an existent and a nonim-plicative negation. As explained above, they maintain that it is “real existence” asthe object of negation that must be refuted, but that the mere nonimplicativenegation that is the nonfinding of that putative object through reasoned analysisis the fully qualified, actual ultimate. They further claim that the apprehension ofthat emptiness, even a conceptual one by a correct reasoning consciousness of anordinary being, is a realization of the ultimate. Hence, such an apprehension is notan object of negation, whereas the apprehension of reality or real existence is.All of this is definitely alien to Centrism. First, we have to remember howexistents and nonimplicative negations are understood. Also in the Gelugpa tra-dition, an existent is usually defined as “what is established or observable throughvalid cognition.” Valid cognitions are two: perception and inferential valid cog-576The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 576"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"nition. This means that an existent cannot but be observed through either ofthese two. As for a nonimplicative negation, it was explained earlier that it isdefined—by Gelugpas as well—as an object of a conceptual consciousness. Thus,it can never be an object of any kind of nonconceptual perception (which is,however, exactly what the Gelugpa tradition claims it to be in the case of empti-ness as a nonimplicative negation).To start with, claiming that emptiness is an existent openly contradicts whatN›g›rjuna and other Centrists say:To say “existence” is the clinging to permanence.To say “nonexistence” is the view of extinction.Therefore, the learned should not dwellIn either existence or nonexistence.1408If emptiness were an existent—something observable through valid cognition—it would follow that it cannot be realized at all, since AtıŸa and many other Cen-trists say that emptiness cannot be realized through valid cognition. As hisEntrance into the Two Realitiesdrastically clarifies:Perceptual and inferential cognition—These two are accepted by Buddhists.Only narrow-minded fools sayThat emptiness is realized by these two.Perceptual and inferential cognition are useless.It is just for the sake of refuting non-Buddhist opponentsThat the learned ones have promoted them.The learned master Bhavya saidThat the scriptures are clear about[The ultimate] being realized neither throughConceptual nor nonconceptual consciousnesses.1409The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Lifeagrees:The ultimate is not the sphere of cognition.It is said that cognition is the seeming.1410Since all valid cognitions are classified as subcategories of cognition, the ultimateis not an object of any valid cognition and thus cannot be an existent.Given that Centrists like N›g›rjuna and Candrakırti explicitly reject the notionMajor Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations577Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:37 AM Page 577"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"of valid cognition, except on the level of mere worldly conventions, how couldemptiness as the ultimate reality be established or observed by something that isitself not established as anything other than a seeming convention? If somethingthat is a mere worldly convention is sufficient to realize emptiness, what is theneed for the supramundane insight of the noble ones? Also, if emptiness were real-ized by valid cognition that is a mere worldly convention, it could only be estab-lished as some worldly convention too. Thus, it is not the ultimate, but justseeming reality.The above verses also contradict Tsongkhapa’s claim that even ordinary beingscould realize the fully qualified ultimate reality through a correct reasoning con-sciousness. But even if they could, what would be the point of going through thepaths of seeing and meditation or the ten grounds of bodhisattvas? If ordinarybeings indeed realize the actual ultimate, it follows that they are Buddhas or atleast bodhisattvas on the path of seeing. In fact, any realization of the ultimateby ordinary beings as a nonimplicative negation for a correct reasoning con-sciousness can only refer to nominal ultimate reality, which still belongs to seem-ing reality. However, Tsongkhapa insists that this realization of ordinary beingsis a realization of actual ultimate reality, just in a conceptual way. But if actualultimate reality is indeed realized by a conceptual consciousness, it follows thatthe ultimate itself is a conceptual object, which in turn rules out that it can be theobject of the nonconceptual wisdom in the meditative equipoise of noble ones.This leads to the paradox that ordinary beings realize ultimate reality, while thenoble ones, such as Buddhas and bodhisattvas, do not. In other words, the con-ceptual realization of emptiness by ordinary beings would be the perfect seeing,and its realization by noble ones the false seeing. This is not only absurd but alsothe reverse of what Candrakırti’s Entrance into Centrismsays:It is through the perfect and the false seeing of all entitiesThat the entities that are thus found bear two natures.The object of perfect seeing is true realityAnd false seeing is seeming reality.1411Another complication here is that, following Dign›ga and Dharmakırti, allBuddhist systems agree that conceptuality and direct (nonconceptual) perceptionare mutually exclusive. In uniquely stark contrast to the otherwise strictly fol-lowed epistemology of Dign›ga and Dharmakırti, the Gelugpa Consequential-ist system does notconsider conceptuality and direct perception as mutuallyexclusive, thus blurring the clear-cut and strict distinction by these mastersbetween the two types of valid cognition. It is held that, following an initialmoment of an ordinary being’s inferential cognition of emptiness, all subsequentvalid cognitions1412in that same cognitional sequence are directvalid perceptions578The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 578"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"of emptiness despite being conceptual. Unlike the initial inferential cognition,they do not depend on a reason but on the power of that inference. It gets evenbetter: Such conceptualsubsequent cognitions are explicitly said to be mistakenconsciousnesses affected by ignorance, because only Buddhas and noble bod-hisattvas in meditative equipoise are not affected by the latent tendencies of igno-rance. But at the same time, these conceptual cognitions are held to be directvalid cognitions that realize actual emptiness. Isn’t it good news for all ordinarybeings that aconceptualand mistakenconsciousness can be a directand validcog-nition of emptiness? Never mind the minor detail that if emptiness can be real-ized by a mistaken consciousness, it cannot by definition be the true, unmistakennature of phenomena.Furthermore, if emptiness were an existent, then it would just be one of thefour extremes negated in all Centrist reasonings. Since emptiness is again andagain said to be the very freedom from all four extremes, how could it be one ofthem? This is like saying that the lack of all color is blue. It also follows that theBuddha, N›g›rjuna, and all other Centrists did not realize emptiness, becausethey realized and taught emptiness as the freedom from all extremes of existence,nonexistence, and so on. In other words, if emptiness were an existent, it couldnot be realized by the nonreferential wisdom of the noble ones, since such wis-dom does not observe either existence or nonexistence. If emptiness were an exis-tent and a nonimplicative negation, then, even if it were realized, how wouldone ever attain the freedom from all reference points, since being existent andbeing a nonimplicative negation are nothing but reference points? Moreover, itfollows that all Centrists who teach and realize the freedom from all extremes andreference points would not be Centrists, since emptiness is an existent and a non-implicative negation, which is a reference point for a conceptual consciousness.In an attempt to tackle this problem, Tsongkhapa differentiates between“being ultimate” (Tib. don dam yin pa) and “ultimately existing” (Tib. don damdu yod pa). Emptiness is said to be ultimate but not to ultimately exist. However,from this it only follows that emptiness must solely exist on the conventional orseeming level, since it is said to be existent but not ultimately existent, and thereis no third possibility.There is no doubt in any Centrist text that the fully qualified, actual ultimateis solely realized in the meditative equipoise of noble ones. Candrakırti definesthe seeming as the object of false seeing. Therefore, unlike the actual emptinessthat is directly perceived by the yogic valid perception of noble ones, an empti-ness in the sense of a nonimplicative negation (which by definition can only beascertained through inferential valid cognition) belongs only to seeming realityand is thus just deceptively true. To claim that a conceptual object—the absenceof real existence through the negation of real existence—is the fully qualifiedultimate is simply to confuse the pointing finger with the moon to which itMajor Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations579Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 579"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"points. Since a nonimplicative negation cannot appear to any kind of noncon-ceptual perception, not even to a mistaken one, how should it ever appear for thewisdom minds of noble ones or a Buddha in whom even the most subtle discur-siveness has subsided? On the other hand, if such a nonimplicative negationwould appear to the yogic valid perception of noble ones, it would inevitablyfollow that this perception is a conceptual consciousness, which by definition itis not. And if emptiness as a nonimplicative negation does not appear to suchyogic perception, it simply follows that the noble ones do not realize emptiness.When Tsongkhapa and his followers attempt to sustain their claim of empti-ness as a nonimplicative negation being the object of even the nonconceptualwisdom in meditative equipoise, by insisting that yogic direct perception directlycognizes such a nonimplicative negation, they again blur the distinction betweenthe two types of valid cognition (inferential/conceptual and percep-tual/nonconceptual valid cognition). However, in the same way as these two cat-egories of valid cognition that are meant to be mutually exclusive then come tooverlap, the nature of this nonimplicative negation as an object of both inferen-tial and perceptual valid cognition is also dual and thus highly unclear. It wouldbe the only phenomenon ever to be an object of both a conceptual and a non-conceptual consciousness, but what should that be? Is it a functional entity, anonentity, both, or neither? It cannot be an entity, because functional entities bydefinition cannot be cognized by conceptual consciousnesses. Moreover, entitiesare parts of seeming reality, and emptiness as a nonimplicative negation is sup-posed to be the ultimate. For the same reason, it cannot be a nonentity either. Ahypothetical something that is both an entity and a nonentity is by definition notan existent, since existents are exhaustively divided into entities and nonentities,whereas emptiness as a nonimplicative negation is held to be an existent. Thesame problem applies to a hypothetical something that is neither an entity nor anonentity.The difference between the conceptual cultivation of a negation and directseeing may be illustrated by an example. When people with blurred vision con-sult a doctor, they might be told, “There is no doubt that you see all these thingslike floating hairs, but none of them really exists.” By keeping this in mind, thepatients may eventually cease to be confused and upset by these appearances.However, merely cultivating this notion of the actual nonexistence of what theysee does not eliminate the appearances themselves. Once the patients becomecured and thus see unobscured, open space without floating hairs, they obvi-ously do not see “the nonimplicative negation of the real existence of floatinghairs.” Technically speaking, one may say that they see space “qualified” by theabsence of floating hairs, but in terms of immediate experience, they just see“what is as it is,” since it is no longer obscured by anything.Furthermore, since also Tsongkhapa and his followers say that the meditative580The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 580"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"equipoise of noble ones is without appearance, how could a nonimplicative nega-tion be perceived in such a meditative equipoise, if it does not even appear for it?And if something does not appear in the meditative equipoise of noble ones, howcan it be said to exist as ultimate reality? What does not appear in their medita-tive equipoise could only be either their “mere seeming,” the seeming reality ofordinary beings, or the false seeming (such as a hallucination). In general, whatcan be said to exist without even appearing or being cognized? So if ultimatereality—emptiness as a nonimplicative negation—cannot appear to the wisdomin the meditative equipoise of noble ones, what is it then that is realized in sucha supramundane meditative state? And how could the ultimate ever be realized,if not through this wisdom?In general, every negation must depend on the rejection of an affirmation orproposition, which means that emptiness as a nonimplicative negation is notonly conceptual but also dependent on something else. In fact, the very existenceof a negation can only make sense in opposition to an affirmation. Hence, it is amutually dependent phenomenon caught in the dichotomies of being and notbeing, thus belonging to the realm of seeming reality. How could such a dichoto-mous conceptual fabrication be the ultimate nature of all phenomena? In addi-tion, as a seeming, dependent phenomenon that is an object of a conceptualconsciousness, every nonimplicative negation in itself cannot withstand analysis.This means that if emptiness were a nonimplicative negation, then it would notbe findable under analysis for the ultimate. Hence, even for Gelugpas it cannotbe ultimate reality, since their standard definition of ultimate reality is “what isfound from the perspective of the final reasoning consciousness.”If emptiness were an existent and a nonimplicative negation, it would not beemptiness, because every existent is just a bearerof emptiness as the nature of allphenomena and is not this nature itself. Moreover, this contradicts the emptinessof emptiness, since it follows that the emptiness of emptiness is an existent anda nonimplicative negation too, but not emptiness as the freedom from allextremes. So what is the difference between the emptiness of emptiness as a non-implicative negation and the emptiness of a table as a nonimplicative negation?In other words, the emptiness of emptiness must then be the nonimplicativenegation of a nonimplicative negation. But what is that supposed to be? A nega-tion of a negation resulting in an affirmation? Since emptiness is said to be anexistent, whatever the emptiness of emptiness as a nonimplicative negation ofthis existent might be then, it would definitely not be an existent. Thus, it fol-lows that emptiness and its own emptiness would be different. By extrapolatingthis, such an emptiness of emptiness can only lead to an infinite regress.According to Tsongkhapa, only the apprehension of real existence (as theobject of negation) is to be discarded, but the apprehension of emptiness as a non-implicative negation is explicitly to be sustained. From this, it follows that theMajor Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations581Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 581"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"teachings and any meditation on the emptiness of emptiness (as the nonim-plicative negation of this nonimplicative negation) are superfluous, since the firstemptiness and its apprehension are not to be given up. Moreover, this contradictsnumerous Centrist statements about actually notsustaining any mode of appre-hension or reference points, which includes letting go of negations too. As⁄›ntideva’s famous verses say:Through familiarity with the latent tendencies of emptiness,The latent tendencies of entities will be relinquished.Through familiarity with “utter nonexistence,”These too will be relinquished later on.Once neither entities nor nonentitiesRemain before the mind,There is no other mental flux [either].Therefore, it is utter nonreferential peace.1413As mentioned above, Tsongkhapa says that emptiness can only exist as thenature of a given phenomenon X. This means that without X, there is no empti-ness of X. In effect, emptiness thus depends on the existence of a conventionallyestablished phenomenon X. In other words, emptiness itself is a dependently orig-inated phenomenon. From this, it follows that emptiness is not ultimate reality butbelongs to seeming reality. Phenomenon X is said to be empty precisely becauseit exists in dependence on something else. That is why it is part of seeming real-ity. If emptiness also exists only in dependence on something else, it must be a partof seeming reality too. One may well adduce the unity of dependent originationand emptiness here, but the point is that if emptiness itselfexists—or worse, orig-inates—in dependence, it cannot be the ultimate. And if it still were the ultimate,then everything that depends on something else would be the ultimate.In the same vein, if emptiness—a nonimplicative negation and thus a nonen-tity—is an existent that exists in entities such as form, does it so exist as some-thing mutually exclusive or as something connected to these entities? If it issupposed to exist as something mutually exclusive to them, it obviously cannotexist in them at all. And if it existed as something connected to them, it wouldhave to exist either through being connected causally or in terms of identity, but,by definition, neither of these connections is possible for nonentities.1414In fact,any connection between entities and nonentities is by definition impossible, justlike space is neither identically nor causally connected to the matter within space.To be really picky, if emptiness is an existent and a nonimplicative negation,does it then imply its own existence or not? If it does, it is not a nonimplicative582The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 582"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"negation; and if it does not, it does not exist.In his Great Stages of the Path, Tsongkhapa says:When the existence of a nature is negatively determined, no doubt thelack of a nature must be positively determined.1415Since the lack of a nature is understood as equivalent to emptiness, this meansthat emptiness is to be positively determined, which clearly contradicts the claimthat emptiness is a nonimplicative negation.In terms of the result of realizing emptiness as a nonimplicative negation, sincethe state of Buddhahood is nothing but the complete revelation of emptiness, itmust also be a nonimplicative negation. But how could the mere absence of realor inherent existence be Buddhahood? Apart from being absurd, how could sucha fruition appeal to anybody or make anybody take up a path that leads to thatsort of attainment? Why should any bodhisattva-to-be be inspired to strive forattaining a mere negation or extinction that is even less of an attainment thanarhathood? And how does a mere negation or absence of real existence accountfor all the infinite qualities and activities of a Buddha? Moreover, since Tsong -khapa claims that the wisdom that realizes emptiness is impermanent and belongsto seeming reality, how can something impermanent that only operates in seem-ing reality realize something permanent1416and ultimate? If emptiness is a non-implicative negation and thus by definition permanent, it follows that N›g›rjunaand others were wrong in making statements such as:The four possibilities of permanent, impermanent, and so on,Where should they be in this peace?1417At this point, this should be too obvious to mention, but it is one of the stan-dard objections to the refutation of emptiness being an existent and a nonim-plicative negation to answer that emptiness must then be a nonexistent or animplicative negation. Clearly, none of the above consequences or negations ofemptiness being existent and a nonimplicative negation implies any such thing,since—unlike emptiness—they in fact arenonimplicative negations. Otherwise,they would just lead to other inconsistencies that are the inverse of the problemsdemonstrated. Moreover, it was explained over and over that dichotomous—orany other—categories simply do not apply to emptiness.It must be likewise clear that none of this means to deny or downplay theimportant role in Centrism of negation in general and of nonimplicative nega-tion in particular. However, it can only be repeated that all reasonings and nega-tions work solely on the level of seeming reality.

He is, however, concerned about the possible problem of Consequen-tialism being left with no basis for a connection between karmic causes and effectsat all and thus no basis for proper conduct, with the result of falling into theextreme of extinction or nihilism. Hence, Tsongkhapa claims that one of theunique features of Candrakırti’s system is that disintegratedness as a functionalentity serves as the support to connect past actions and their results. For scrip-tural support, he refers to two quotes from the sixth chapter of The SÒtra of theTen Groundsin Candrakırti’sLucid Words:Dying has two functions: It makes formations disintegrate and bringsforth the cause for ignorance not being interrupted.[D]eath [comes about] through the condition of birth.He also refers to a line from The Fundamental Verses:Entities and nonentities are conditioned.1419The contexts of these quotes in Candrakırti’s text are as follows:As for something disintegrating, in terms of its own nature, it is anentity, but since its nature is that a phenomenon (such as form) comesto an end, it is a nonentity. Furthermore, it is said, “Dying has twofunctions: It makes formations disintegrate and brings forth the causefor ignorance not being interrupted.” So, based on this passage, howshould something disintegrating not be something that has a cause?1420N›g›rjuna’s entire verse reads:How could nirv› ̊a beBoth an entity and a nonentity?Nirv› ̊a is unconditioned.Entities and nonentities are conditioned.584The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 584"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"Candrakırti comments:Entities are conditioned, since they originate from the gathering of theirown causes and conditions. Nonentities are also conditioned, since theycome about in dependence on entities and because it is said that “death[comes about] through the condition of birth.” Therefore, if nirv› ̊ahad the nature of both an entity and a nonentity, it would be condi-tioned. But if it were conditioned, [this is contradictory to the fact]that it is not asserted as something conditioned [here by N›g›rjuna].Therefore, it is not suitable to be either an entity or a nonentity.1421First, it is to be noted that none of these passages speaks about the state of hav-ing disintegratedbut about something disintegrating(or dying).1422Candrakırtisays that, from different perspectives, something disintegrating (not the state ofsomething having already disintegrated) can be regarded as either an entity or anonentity. He states that something disintegrating (or dying) is not uncaused, buthe does not state that the state of having disintegrated itself causes something else.As for the statement that “Dying brings forth the cause for ignorance not beinginterrupted,” this just points to the continuation of the twelve links of depend-ent origination, with the link of ignorance following that of dying. Also, thephrase “Death [comes about] through the condition of birth” refers to this con-tinuity of the twelve links. Obviously, this does not mean that dying (or havingdied) itself causes ignorance.1423Candrakırti’s text also quotes a long passage fromThe Rice Seedling SÒtrathat glosses this expression and explains the nature of allthe twelve links of dependent origination:The aggregates . . . becoming disintegrated is called “Aging and dying[come] from birth.” Thus, these twelve links of dependent origination. . . are neither permanent nor impermanent, neither conditioned norunconditioned, . . . not phenomena that become extinguished, notphenomena that disintegrate, not phenomena that cease.

In this way, both entities and nonentitiesstand in contradistinction to nirv› ̊a, which is unconditioned in both of theseways.

Another questionis what would be caused by the functional entity that is this state of the obscu-rations having disintegrated. If the disintegratedness of actions can cause theresults of these actions, why should the disintegratedness of obscurations notcause the results of these obscurations?In brief, neither N›g›rjuna nor Candrakırti says anywhere that the state ofhaving disintegrated is an entity or that this state itself causes something else.Thus, Tsongkhapa’s critics all agree that the above quotes are taken out of con-text and unrelated to what he tries to establish through them. Moreover, there aremany passages in the texts of N›g›rjuna, Buddhap›lita, and Candrakırti thatclearly speak to the contrary. For example, N›g›rjuna’s Fundamental Versessays:If remaining until the time of ripening,Actions would be permanent.If they cease, having ceased,How would their results arise?Why do actions not arise?Because they lack a nature.Since they are unarisen,They do not go to waste.1425Buddhap›lita comments on the latter verse:Hence, not understanding the meaning of true reality, people make alot of different, insubstantial statements by clinging to the mere wordsof “not going to waste” as being a functional entity. Thus, actionsdecidedly lack a nature. Because they lack a nature, they are unarisen.And since they are unarisen, they do not go to waste. This is how theydefinitely should be regarded.1426Candrakırti’s autocommentary onThe Entrance into Centrismsays:Conditioned phenomena originate from coming together.They do not originate from being separated.Conditioned phenomena originate from gathering.They do not originate from nongathering.1427and586The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 586"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"In the light of karmic actions not arising through their own intrinsicnature, they do not cease, and it is also not impossible that [their]results originate due to [them] nothaving disintegrated. Hence, sinceactions do notdisintegrate, the connection between actions and theirresults is very much justified.1428The Karmapa clarifies that if it really were one of Candrakırti’s unique points thatdisintegratedness is a functional entity, his last paragraph should have read:it is also not impossible that [their] results originate due to [their] hav-ing disintegrated. Hence, since actions dodisintegrate, due to disinte-gratedness, the connection between actions and their results is verymuch justified.Moreover, since both N›g›rjuna and Candrakırti emphasize again and again thatall phenomena are without arising and ceasing, how could their having ceased ordisintegrated exist, let alone perform a function? As N›g›rjuna says:If the arisingOf all phenomena is unjustified,Then the ceasingOf all phenomena is not justified [either].Since arising, abiding, and disintegratingAre not established, there are no conditioned phenomena.Since conditioned phenomena are not established,How could unconditioned phenomena be established?1429It is highly absurd that disintegratedness is an entity that can perform a func-tion, since this is simply the nonexistence of whatever entity has disintegrated. Ifan entity has disintegrated, how can its absence also be an entity? Otherwise,everything that is mutually exclusive would not be so, and the lack of rain wouldbe rain. Also, if the disintegratedness—that is, the absence of an action—is anentity that can perform a function, then it follows that its opposite—this actionas long as it exists—is a nonentity that cannot perform a function. Thus, all Bud-dhist texts’ classifications of entities and the lack of entities (or nonentities) wouldbe wrong. However, with this one peculiar exception of disintegratedness as afunctional entity, Tsongkhapa and his followers are very clear that an entity(defined as what performs a function) is mutually exclusive with the lack of entity(what cannot perform a function). So only something that has notdisintegratedMajor Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations587Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 587"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"and is thus not absent, such as gas in the tank of a car, can be an existent func-tional entity. If what is an existent functional entity—the gas—has disintegrated(become nonexistent), we are only left with the very lack of that entity: no gas inthe tank. And what function would the nonexistence of gas perform? That thecar no longer functions is a clear sign that the nonexistence of gas is the absenceof functioning. It might be said that the lack of gas performs the function ofmaking us angry. However, this is not the case, because what makes us angry israther the mental state of our unfulfilled desire to drive somewhere. Otherwise,if it were the nonexistence of gas as such that had the function of producinganger, then everybody would be angry wherever there is no gas and never beangry wherever there is gas. Also, if disintegratedness were an existent entity,everything would be permanent, because there would never be a case of the sim-ple nonexistence of some prior existent that is the exact reverse of its existence.Some might say that darkness comes from the extinction of light, so the light’sextinction must be a causal, functional entity. From this it absurdly follows thatlight is the indirect cause for darkness, since without light there would be noextinction of light and thus no darkness. A further consequence is that in allplaces where there never has been any light, such as in an unopened nutshell,there can be no darkness, since there was no light to be extinguished in the firstplace. If extinction of light is said to refer to just nonexistent light, then a sky-flower must have withered and become extinct, since it is nonexistent. Likewise,if one’s old car has disintegrated in the crusher, one is forced to walk. Hence, itfollows that people who have never had a car in the first place never need to walk,since their cars never disintegrated.The notion of disintegratedness as a functional entity is clearly not commonworldly consensus either. Ordinary people talk about disintegration only in termsof coarse changes in the continua of entities, such as when a house collapses oran apple has completely decayed and disintegrated, but they do not analyze thedisintegration of entities in terms of their mode of momentary, subtle imperma-nence. Also, when notions such as self-awareness and a ground consciousness arerejected even conventionally because of merely being imputations by Buddhistphilosophical systems, there is no ground for replacing these with yet anothersuch imputation as being a part of conventional reality, especially when it is anotion held by non-Buddhist philosophical systems such as the Differentiators.After all supports for karmic continuity imputed by others have extensively beenrefuted, to reintroduce such a support that is moreover claimed to be a func-tional entity established by valid cognition is only a sign of reification nothav-ing disintegrated.In brief, all presentations such as happiness and suffering arising as the resultsof positive and negative actions and cyclic existence being the result of karma andafflictions are given without analysis from the perspective of worldly beings. It may588The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 588"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"be analyzed whether these results arise from the functional entity that is the cause’sdisintegratedness or from the functional entity that is its not having disintegrated,but such analysis is still a presentation of causes and results on the level of seem-ing reality. However, to say, “When analyzed through reasoning, with regard tocauses and results on the level of seeming reality, such and such is establishedthrough the valid cognition of reasoning as something that withstands analysis”means nothing and only entertains the superimpositions and denials of realists.As for Centrists, once they have analyzed, they do not actively put forward anyseeming reality, since actively putting forward something like this means incur-ring the formidable fallacy of having to claim that some phenomena withstandanalysis. In particular, when analyzed, a result arises from neither disintegratednor undisintegrated causes. If the result arose after the cause has disintegrated, itwould follow that everything can arise from everything. If the result arose whilethe cause has not disintegrated, the result would not depend on causes and con-ditions. If it is presumed that a result arises after the cause has already disinte-grated, such a result would just be an extinct entity, since the continuity betweencause and result has been interrupted. If it is presumed that a result arises whilethe cause has not disintegrated, all entities would be simultaneously permanent.In summary, something that has already disintegrated is not suitable as a cause,and something lasting that has not disintegrated yet is not suitable as a causeeither. In fact, what represents the unsurpassable tradition of Centrists is thisvery lack of being weighed down by any discursiveness of attempting to evenconventionally set something up in terms of the connection between cause andresult or their support.The Karmapa adduces many other refutations of disintegratedness as a func-tional entity through both reasoning and scripture (including N›g›rjuna,Bh›vaviveka, ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, and Sakya Pa ̊ ̃ita). However, I refrain from furtherelaboration out of the concern that this could perform the function of causing thelast patient readers to disintegrate too.Tsongkhapa’s view on dependent origination in Centrism goes in the samedirection in the sense that he says that it must be established. He asserts that it isthe unique feature of Centrists to give a presentation of arising and ceasing interms of dependent origination as their own system that is justified through rea-soning, because to properly establish illusionlike arising and ceasing without realexistence serves to avoid the extreme of extinction. However, the expression “illu-sionlike arising and ceasing without real existence” that is used by Centrists refersto passages that prove that, from the perspectives of analysis and the perceptionof noble ones, arising and ceasing in terms of dependent origination are free fromarising and ceasing, just like the merely seeming arising and ceasing of an illusion.Centrists would never even dream of considering such an expression to prove anyestablished existence of arising and ceasing.Major Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations589Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 589"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"For this reason, the Centrist approach of presenting mere conditionality with-out analysis is in clear opposition to any reifications of asserting arising from thefour extremes. Hence, the Centrist way of presenting the two realities is highlysuperior to any such approach by realists, since it expresses the knowable objectsof all persons from ordinary beings to Buddhas in a way that does not contradictcommon worldly consensus. As was said before, to abstain from reifying thingssuch as karma, cause and effect, ethics, and the means to achieve liberation in noway makes these things lack their justification or functioning. To the contrary,it is precisely the fact of their emptiness—their lack of solid and independent exis-tence—that allows for the unimpeded and dynamic flow of the dependent orig-ination of conditioned phenomena. As N›g›rjuna says:For those for whom emptiness is possible,Everything is possible.For those for whom emptiness is not possible, Nothing is possible.andIf all of this were not empty,Nothing would originate and disintegrate,And it would follow that, for you,The four realities of the noble ones do not exist.1431Autonomist Elements in Gelugpa ConsequentialismMany Tibetan and Western scholars have observed that it is quite paradoxical forTsongkhapa and his followers to emphasize such a sharp distinction betweenAutonomists and Consequentialists, and to posit the superiority of the latter overthe former, while at the same time using many elements typical of Autonomistsin their version of Consequentialism. Consequently, there were voices wonder-ing whether Tsongkhapa’s presentation can be called Consequentialism at all.Most of the Autonomist features in Tsongkhapa’s system are the result of hisemphasizing the validity of seeming reality and thus introducing into Conse-quentialism the notion of “establishment through conventional valid cognition.”To start with, Tsongkhapa is even more persistent than Bh›vaviveka in usingqualifiers such as “ultimately,” “actually,” “inherently,” and “by its nature” inorder to emphasize that phenomena do not arise or exist ultimately but validlyarise and exist on the level of seeming reality. He uses such qualifiers both whencommenting on Indian Centrist texts and in his own works, and thus he needsto add words to almost every sentence in Indian Centrist texts, most of which donot employ such qualifications, and even reject them. Despite Candrakırti’s out-spokenness on the subject of rejecting such qualifiers, Tsongkhapa obviously feels590The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 590"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"obliged to introduce them even into Candrakırti’s own system. The main reasonfor this is Tsongkhapa’s sharp distinction between the two realities and his insis-tence on the validity of seeming reality, which is also more an Autonomist thana Consequentialist feature. In his use of the logico-epistemological system of Dign›ga and Dharmakırti,Tsongkhapa definitely follows the main and most controversial innovation by theAutonomist Bh›vaviveka, who was the first to introduce that system into Cen-trism. In many respects, in his version of Consequentialism, Tsongkhapa evenemploys it in a far more extensive way than Indian Autonomists, notwithstand-ing the fact that Candrakırti repeatedly rejected that system in detail.Tsongkhapa criticizes the alleged assertion of Autonomists that phenomena areconventionally established through their own specific characteristics. At the sametime, he elaborates on the phenomena of seeming reality in Consequentialismbeing established through conventional valid cognition. For him, such valid cog-nition is entirely based on the epistemological system of Dign›ga and Dhar-makırti, which in turn revolves around specifically characterized and generallycharacterized phenomena as the two objects of the two types of valid cognition.For example, he literally accords with Autonomists such as Jñ›nagarbha,⁄›ntarak ̋ita and KamalaŸıla when he says in hisGreat Stages of the Path:Entities that are able to perform a function are not negated on theconventional level.1432In particular, Tsongkhapa criticizes autonomous reasoning on the basis of specif-ically characterized phenomena established through conventional valid cogni-tion, but at the same time he claims that Consequentialists engage in negationand proof based on subjects, predicates, and reasons that are established throughconventional valid cognition as appearing in common for both proponents andopponents. However, such establishment through valid cognition as well as some-thing appearing in common for Centrists and their realist opponents is denied indetail by Candrakırti.It is generally known that Tsongkhapa follows Chaba Chökyi Senge in manyfeatures of the latter’s epistemology. In addition, Tauscher has pointed to furtherstriking similarities between the two concerning a number of important topicsin terms of the ontological position in Centrism.1433Such topics include the basisof distinguishing the two realities, their relation, identifying the object of nega-tion, and emptiness or ultimate reality being a knowable object and a nonim-plicative negation.1434Finally, Tsongkhapa’s Consequentialist system also makes use of the distinc-tion between nominal and nonnominal ultimate reality, a feature that was clearlydeveloped in Indian texts unanimously regarded as Autonomist.Major Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations591Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 591"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"Being Discursive about NondiscursivenessWhen considering the development of Centrism over the centuries, one cannothelp noticing a progressive increase of elaboration, if not discursiveness (pra-pañca), in the texts of later masters. Comparing N›g›rjuna’s very simple andstraightforward message of the freedom from all discursiveness (ni ̋prapañca) andhow it was formulated in later Indian Centrist texts or even Tibetan presenta-tions, it seems that ni ̋prapañcahas often been replaced by prapañca. N›g›rjunaand firyadeva demonstrated the utter incoherence of our ordinary notions andexperiences, leaving nothing whatsoever unassailed and intact among these con-ventional entities. Bh›vaviveka started to reintroduce many such conventionali-ties into Centrism. He was criticized for this by Candrakırti, who obviously triedto get back to the Centrist basics, that “N›g›rjuna is not in the business of pro-viding rational arguments designed to substantiate, prove, establish, or makecertain anything.” Not without irony though, despite his radical stance, Can-dra kırti’s “getting back to the roots” went through a lot of prapañcatoo. Thistrend toward extensive explanations, refutations, and rebuttals of objectionsreached its culmination in the writings of many Tibetan masters, particularlyTsongkhapa and his followers. In the maze of usually highly technical and ver-bose exegeses of Centrism, very often the healthy shock effect of the originalCentrist writings gets lost and one starts to wonder what all of this actually wasabout to begin with. So how much prapañcado we need to reach ni ̋prapañca?There are a number of scholars—both Western and Tibetan—who praise espe-cially the writings of Tsongkhapa for their logical simplicity, their philosophicalelegance, and their exegetical ingenuity. Be that as it may, such criteria are purelytechnical or pertain to the building of a philosophical system. As was said before,Buddhism in general and Centrism in particular is not meant as a philosophicaledifice but as a set of tools for experientially attaining an irreversible state of free-dom from suffering for both oneself and others. From the point of view of theBuddha, N›g›rjuna, and Candrakırti, it is not at all the point to be eloquent anderect an impressive monument of brilliant ideas and concepts. If anything, thisis the complete antithesis (if there is such a thing) of what Buddhism and Cen-trism are about and just turns the whole project of striving for the freedom fromreference points upside down. Particularly in Centrism, we are not talking aboutphilosophical elegance, systemic coherence, or the need to make perfect sense onthe level of conceptual conventions, but about the liberation of our mind, whichis a different ball game altogether. Setting up some philosophy is simply not thesame as striving for all beings’ freedom from suffering.1435As Napper says, Tsongkhapa “insisted that the whole system should fit together,that it should make sense. For him, there are no paradoxes.”1436However, suchnotions are purely related to system building, which may or may not make senseon some level. In contrast, what N›g›rjuna and Candrakırti demonstrated so592The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 592"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"extensively is precisely that nothing makes sense when it is analyzed, not evensuch ordinary, everyday things as going. In this sense, the fact that nothing reallymakes sense is called sa ̇s›ra. Experientially, as long as nobody analyzes ordinaryappearances, they just appear and function. From this perspective, the questionof whether they make sense or not does not even arise. This is merely a matter ofquestioning what appears to us and trying to make sense of it. Nirv› ̊a then doesnot mean the grand idea that suddenly everything makes sense or that one real-izes the true meaning of life. From the perspective of attaining ni ̋prapañca, it justmeans letting go of trying to make sense of all these things that cannot makesense. Thus, the decisive criterion for any presentation of the heart of Centrismis not whether it makes good sense (which does not, of course, mean that, con-ventionally, it should notmake sense) but whether what is presented serves as ameans for ending ignorance and afflictions and thus leading to Buddhahood.All that N›g›rjuna and Candrakırti ever point to is the dissolution of the webof our many reference points; they are far from seeking to introduce new ones.On the one hand, Tsongkhapa seems to follow them by rejecting certain notionsof other philosophical systems, such as a real self, a ground consciousness, andself-awareness, even on the conventional level. On the other hand, he introducesa whole new set of reifying concepts, such as “establishment through conven-tional valid cognition,” “identification and subdivisons of the object of nega-tion,” “disintegratedness as a functional entity,” and “emptiness as an existent andnonimplicative negation.” In terms of ni ̋prapañca, all of this places him light-years away from N›g›rjuna and Candrakırti, whom he claims to follow so closely.Even worse, the Karmapa says, none of these new concepts is in any way helpfulfor remedying the afflictions or leading to liberation; they just add to the gigan-tic web of reifying prapañcathat we keep spinning.And even in terms of simply formulating a philosophical system, Siderits putsthe crux of the Centrist view as follows:Thus the Madhyamaka position would appear to be that it is not suf-ficient to attach to one’s theory of knowledge the proviso that it is for-mulated entirely at the level of conventional truth; if one’s theorypurports to be more than a provisional description of conventionalepistemic practices, if there is about it any pretense at systematicity,rigor, and theoretical elegance, it will inevitably come up against thefact that no metaphysical theory can be fully adequate to the nature ofthe world.1437This is precisely the problem Tsongkhapa and his followers run into, especiallysince they commit themselves to a large number of fixed points that are regardedas definite and incontestable. Thus, Tsongkhapa’s own history as a writer andMajor Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations593Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 593"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"the subsequent philosophical history of Gelugpa exegesis consist to a large degreeof elaborating on these points, attempting to remove any inconsistencies, makingadditional and ever more intricate distinctions and classifications, and defendingthese increasingly monumental constructions against any criticism, be it withindifferent Gelugpa colleges or by other schools.1438From the perspective of Cen-trism, this is an infinite process without any hope of final success. In a way, it won-derfully illustrates the basic problem as identified by Centrists: If you start to setup even one reference point, you will inevitably have to create more and more ofthem, spinning yourself into a big cocoon. It is the nature of reference pointsthat each one implies further ones and that all of them need to be constantlypatched up in order to somehow stick together in a more or less coherent way.In brief, if Centrism is explained as a consistent philosophical, ontological, orlogical system, that may appeal to our wish for some well-organized, all-explana-tory picture of the world and how we perceive it. Usually, we just want to havesomething that makes good sense, something on which we can build our beliefsystems or, in the case of Centrism, a belief system for why and how we shouldnot have any belief system. However, all attempts to force Centrism into anykind of system at all must necessarily fail due to the very nature of what Centrismis: the radical deconstruction of any system and conceptualization whatsoever,including itself. Reintroducing into Centrism any notions of justification, valid-ity, or making sense (with more subtle ones being more tricky here than grossones) precisely reestablishes and fortifies the very traps that the Centrist approachwants us to let go of altogether. To this, Centrists could be tempted to say, “Talk-ing heads, stop making sense!”It is precisely this soteriological issue of untrapping ourselves that lies at theheart of the Eighth Karmapa’s critique, and not primarily whether there are anyphilosophical or logical inconsistencies. Like N›g›rjuna and Candrakırti, he gen-uinely distances himself from engaging in inflationary prapañca, especially whensuch is not conducive to attaining ni ̋prapañca. Instead, he never tires of point-ing to ni ̋prapañca, both explicitly and by every so often cutting through treas-ured beliefs and reference points, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist. Of course,as the Karmapa’s explanations amply show, this in no way means to completelyshun prapañcaby falling into the other extremes of merely not saying and think-ing anything at all or simply remaining stupid. Rather, only certain kinds and cer-tain amounts of prapañca(determined solely by their soteriological relevance)are employed in an expedient way in order to gradually sharpen our wisdom,but they are meant to be immediately dropped once their purpose is accom-plished.Another way to put this is that, for the Karmapa, the issue is not whether onemanages to find out the single right view as opposed to all wrong views, butwhether there is clinging to any view at all, whether it is “right” or “wrong.” For594The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 594"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"better or worse, this is sometimes called “the view of no view.” Seen from the per-spective of analysis for the ultimate and the meditative equipoise of noble ones,all views are neither right nor wrong but are simply different types of clinging tovarious reference points. As the famous Sakya pith instruction called “freedomfrom fourfold clinging”1439says:If you cling to this life, you are not a dharma practitioner.If you cling to cyclic existence, it is not renunciation.If you cling to your own welfare, it is not the mind of enlightenment.If there is clinging, it is not the view.Since Centrism is about the experience of freedom from all reference points,any reference points, whether they are called “views,” “right,” “wrong,” “free-dom from reference points,” or “the view of no view,” are eventually to bedropped. From the point of “view” of the nonreferential expanse of ultimate real-ity, apprehending, viewing, preferring, or even insisting on anything is nothingbut self-imposed bondage within mind’s open and spacious nature.All of this is intimately connected with the Karmapa’s emphasis on actuallyputting the Centrist approach into practice and making it a living experience. Infact, all Centrist texts and reasonings are utterly pointless when not personallyemployed as tools to work with one’s own mind. If the remedy is not used for itsonly purpose—removing individual reifications and the ensuing suffering—itwill inevitably turn into the very problem that it is meant to overcome. Insteadof leading to ni ̋prapañca, it will just be another set of—at best—more sophisti-cated prapañcaor simply a waste of time. At worst, it may even be misused tobuild up intellectual pride and further wrong views. Moreover, the significanceof many topics in Buddhism and Centrism as well as certain ways to phrase thembecome clear only when applied to one’s own experience.As with any other tool, whether Centrism is soteriologically effective or justanother headache depends solely on the user. Even the best tool is worth noth-ing if it is not put into action. For example, if we want to cut down a tree withan axe, it is helpful and necessary to sharpen the axe as well as to receive someinstructions on how to handle it properly, but at some point we simply have tocut the tree. It does not make the job any easier to figure out who made the axe,of which alloy it consists, the exact angle at which the axe will hit the tree, howit will come out of the wood again, and at what speed the tree will fall. Thatsuch speculations are even more out of place in the context of eliminating suf-fering is dramatically illustrated by the Buddha in a famous example:This is as if a man is hit by an arrow thickly smeared with poison. Hisfriends will call a physician, but [the wounded person] says: “I will notMajor Differences between Mikyö Dorje’s and Tsongkhapa’s Interpretations595Center Sunlit-03 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 595"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"pull out this arrow until I know the name and the family of the archer,whether he is tall or short, has black, brown, or golden skin, where helives, how bow and string are made, what the constituents of the arroware, and the feathers of which bird are attached to it.” This man,M›luºkyaputta, would die before knowing all that.1440The preeminence of the experiential and pragmatic ground from which all Bud-dhist teachings grow is also highlighted by D. T. Suzuki:We must keep one thing always before our minds, . . . which is, thatBuddhist thought is always the outcome of Buddhist life; that is, itslogic, or psychology, or metaphysics cannot be understood adequatelyunless we realize that facts of Buddhist experience are at its basis and,therefore, that pure logic is not the key to the understanding of Bud-dhist philosophy.1441On the one hand, using precise philosophical categories and analyses in scrip-tures such as the Centrist ones, whose primary aim is to provide the means forthe transcendence of dualistic thinking altogether, in order to give way tounmediated direct insight into the nature of all phenomena is like attempting toapply a mathematical formula in order to capture the experience of being com-pletely absorbed in a wonderful piece of music or watching a breathtaking sun-set. So, “pure logic” is surely not the ultimate key to understanding Buddhist textsand views, and we should not expect to find the ultimately correct conceptualpresentation of facts and experiences on the Buddhist path that by definition lieoutside the realm of conceptual mind anyway. Even on the mundane plane, whatwould be thefinally correct presentation of the taste of chocolate? And even ifthere were such a thing, what would its relevance be for the actual experience oftasting chocolate? After all that has been said here, it should be clear that I do nothold a brief for some kind of “mysticism” or even “irrationalism.” At the sametime, we must accept that “pure experience” per se does not lead to an under-standing of treatises that are grounded in a rational format to speak about some-thing that is beyond the confines of language and reason. In the realm of theactual experience that such texts point to, reason and language have lost all mean-ing and the work of the scholar has reached its end. Still, in exploring the rationaldimension of our minds—without which Centrist texts could never be writtenor read by us—such texts may well serve as the means to encounter in this verymind the experience behind (or in the very middle of) all the words and reason-ings.The Buddha himself always emphasized that trust is good but knowing is bet-ter.

As theyoung crown prince grew up, the day approached when he was to ascend thethrone. The night before his coronation, ⁄›ntideva had a dream in which he sawthe throne of the kingdom already occupied by MañjuŸrı, who said to him, “Thisis my throne and I am your spiritual friend. It is very inappropriate to sit on thesame throne as me.” He also dreamed of firyat›r› in the guise of his own mother,who poured hot water over his head.

Because of ⁄›ntideva’s skill in all arts and crafts as well as hisintelligence, the king requested him to become one of his ministers, and heaccepted for the time being. During that period, ⁄›ntideva had a strong and ben-eficial spiritual influence in the kingdom, which made the other ministers jealous.They said to the king, “This man is very deceitful. Even his sword is not a realone; it is just made of wood.” (In fact, this sword, which ⁄›ntideva always carried,was the symbol of his teacher MañjuŸrı.) Upon hearing this, the king asked all theCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 601"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"ministers to show him their swords. When ⁄›ntideva’s turn came, he said, “OLord, it is not good for you to view my sword, it will harm you.” Of course, theking only became more suspicious and insisted on seeing the sword. ⁄›ntidevaanswered, “If you really want to see it, please cover your right eye and look at itonly with your left.” When ⁄›ntideva drew his sword out of its sheath, the shinewas so powerfully dazzling that the king’s left eye went blind for a while. Quickly⁄›ntideva put the sword back, and everybody realized that he was not just anordinary person but a great siddha. The king and his ministers requested him tostay on, but he refused and advised the king to rule the country in accordance withthe dharma and to establish twenty centers for Buddhist learning.Having given this advice, he left the kingdom and journeyed toward the cen-tral part of India. When he arrived at the great Buddhist university of N›land›,he was ordained by the preceptor Jayadeva and received the name ⁄›ntideva.After his ordination, he lived among all the other great masters and mah›pa ̊ ̃itasat N›land›. Inwardly, he continuously received teachings from MañjuŸrı and, inhis cell, wrote two scriptures known as The Compendium of Trainingand TheCompendium of SÒtras.1444In his outer appearance, however, ⁄›ntideva was justsleeping day and night. The only time his fellow monks would see him was atmeals, when he would eat a huge amount of rice. After a while, everybody becamequite upset about him. They said, “He is just wasting the offerings of food anddrink that people make to the monastery out of devotion. Monastics are supposedto engage in study, reflection, and meditation, but he is doing none of these.” So the pa ̊ ̃itas discussed the matter and decided to expel him from N›land›.They came up with a scheme to have the monks take turns reciting the scriptures.They thought this would make ⁄›ntideva leave on his own, since he would havenothing to say. When his turn came to recite something, at first he refused to doit. Upon being repeatedly pressed, he eventually agreed and asked the monks toset up a seat for him. At this, some of them became a little suspicious, but nev-ertheless they built a throne and assembled with the intention to humiliate⁄›ntideva. He came, sat on the throne, and asked them, “What do you want meto teach, something that has already been taught or something that has neverbeen taught before?” Eager to make fun of him, they cried, “Recite somethingnew!” So ⁄›ntideva recited the entire Bodhicary›vat›raas spontaneous verse. Itsoon became clear to this audience of great scholars that his teaching was some-thing extraordinary, and they started to memorize it. Eventually, ⁄›ntideva cameto verse IX.34:Once neither entities nor nonentitiesRemain before the mind,There is no other mental flux [either].Therefore, it is utter nonreferential peace.602The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 602"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"At this point, he rose up into the sky, and soon his body disappeared com-pletely, but his voice continued to be heard until the end of the last chapter.After his voice had stopped, the pa ̊ ̃itas compared what they had memorizedand found that among them they had three versions. The Kashmiri scholars hadmemorized more than a thousand verses but had missed the verses of homage inthe beginning. Of course, nobody had been paying attention at the beginning,since everybody thought that ⁄›ntideva had no clue about anything. The schol-ars from eastern India had only seven hundred verses, again missing the homageand also the second and ninth chapters. The version of the scholars from centralIndia was missing the homage and the tenth chapter on dedication. So they dis-cussed the matter and finally decided to send three scholars to see ⁄›ntideva andask for his advice. T›ran›tha’s account says that ⁄›ntideva was staying in a place called Kaliºgain Triliºga, while other historical reports say that he lived in ⁄rı Dak ̋i ̊a in southIndia. When the three scholars found ⁄›ntideva, they supplicated him to returnto N›land›, but he refused. They then asked, “So how should we study The Com-pendium of Trainingand The Compendium of SÒtrasthat you mentioned in theBodhicary›vat›ra? Where are these three texts?” ⁄›ntideva replied, “The first twotexts are written on birch bark, and you can find them on the windowsill of mycell at N›land›. As for the Bodhicary›vat›ra, the version of the scholars fromcentral India is the correct one.”1445At that time, ⁄›ntideva was living with five hundred other monks in a greatBuddhist monastery located in a nearby forest full of deer and other animalsThese creatures were very tame and used to come to the humans in themonastery. However, many of the deer that ⁄›ntideva’s fellow monastics sawgoing into his room never came out again. They also noticed that the number ofwild animals in the forest kept decreasing. So some monks started to peepthrough his window, and they saw ⁄›ntideva eating the flesh of these animals.Especially for a monk, this was considered a really bad thing to do in India. How-ever, when the monks accused him of doing this, ⁄›ntideva instantly revived allthe animals, and they came out of his room stronger and healthier than before.As usual, he was asked to stay and, as usual, he refused.This time, though, ⁄›ntideva did not just leave the monastery but left monas-ticism altogether. He became a wandering yogin practicing Vajray›na in manyunconventional ways. Thus, he acted just like other great siddhas, such as N›ropaand Maitrıpa, who had also been mah›pa ̊ ̃itas at N›land› and also left.⁄›ntideva went to southern India and engaged in contests of debate and magicwith non-Buddhist scholars and yogins. He performed many supernatural activ-ities for the benefit of others, such as miraculously providing food or stopping awar. Thus, he became one of the well-known mah›siddhas of this time in India.Some Remarks on the Bodhicary›vat›raand Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary603Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 603"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Lifeand Its Ninth ChapterAs can be seen, The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Lifewas not created asa scholarly work but as a doh›, a spontaneous yogic song of realization. Allmah›siddhas, such as Saraha, Tilopa, and N›ropa, sang many such songs, andMilarepa’s Hundred Thousand Songsare very well known by most Buddhists. Ina similar way, ⁄›ntideva delivered his text as extemporaneous verses in superbSanskrit poetry. However, it is more than just a masterpiece of Sanskrit literature.More important for the Buddhist practitioner is that, because of the way thistext originated, it also carries the blessing of the supreme realization of a greatbodhisattva and mah›siddha. At the same time, in terms of its content, ⁄›nti -deva’s text describes the entire path of a bodhisattva in a lucid style that is verypractice oriented and often sounds like personal advice. For these two reasons,this text is said to represent the lineage of practice and blessing.1446Thus, it ishighly accessible even for ordinary beings who wish to follow the path of a bod-hisattva and at the same time masterfully spreads both of the two great wings ofthis path: the knowledge of cultivating the profound view of emptiness and thecompassionate means of vast skillful activities. Therefore, the text is said to rep-resent the lineage of the unity of view and activity,1447starting with the cultiva-tion of the mind of enlightenment as the root of all practices of the great vehicleand then presenting detailed instructions on all six perfections, from generosityup through supreme knowledge. For all these reasons, at all times, Buddhistscholars and practitioners alike consider ⁄›ntideva’s text to be very special, andit has enjoyed great popularity to the present day.In this vein, its ninth chapter on the perfection of prajñ› has to be seen as anorganic and integral part of the whole text and not as standing in sharp contrastto the other chapters that seem so much more accessible and down-to-earth.Despite ⁄›ntideva’s rising into the sky while reciting the ninth chapter, it is notsomething far out. Just like the rest of The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way ofLife, it is meant to be practiced, not just read or studied. People going throughthis text from the beginning are often quite shocked upon encountering the acu-ity and dissecting quality of the ninth chapter. It seems to annihilate the entirebeautiful edifice of the path of compassion that ⁄›ntideva so eloquently builtthroughout the first eight chapters. To put it bluntly, many feel that they plungefrom “love and light” right into “brainy hairsplitting.” However, after all that hasbeen said about the project of Centrism, it should be clear that this is not at allwhat the ninth chapter is about. Rather, as the chapter’s title says, it is aboutperfecting the most profound insight into the true nature of all phenomena.Moreover, ⁄›ntideva uses reasoning in other chapters of his text too, particularlyin the sixth on patience. Obviously, for him, intellect and compassion—or insightand means—are not mutually exclusive, nor do they obstruct each other. Rather,604The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 604"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"the whole text is an expression of the inseparable unity of wisdom and compas-sion. It is precisely through cultivating this unity that one practices the way of lifeof a bodhisattva. Thus, the other chapters of The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Wayof Lifeare in fact included in the ninth and support it, while the spirit of thischapter pervades them all. This is expressed by verse IX.1:All of these branchesWere taught by the Sage for the sake of knowledge.Therefore, those who wish for sufferingTo subside should develop knowledge.As for ⁄›ntideva’s view, Pawo Rinpoche quotes AtıŸa as saying that his ultimateview is the undifferentiable unity of wisdom and the expanse of dharmas. Hisapproach in the chapter on prajñ› is aimed at opening our minds into wakeful spa-ciousness by relentlessly undermining all clinging to reference points. By mainlyjust formulating absurd consequences that follow from the positions of others, heclearly follows the style of a Consequentialist. In a way, ⁄›ntideva surveys thewhole range of Centrist opponents and arguments from the time of N›g›rjuna tothe eighth century. For example, N›g›rjuna mainly challenged the realism of theBuddhist systematizers of the Abhidharma. firyadeva concentrated on the ›tmanof the Enumerators and the theories of the Logicians and the Analyzers. Later,Candrakırti launched his attack on Mere Mentalism and Bh›vaviveka’s way of rea-soning. ⁄›ntideva addresses both Buddhist and non-Buddhist opponents butfocuses on the systems of the Enumerators, Logicians, and Analyzers as well as onthe notion of a creator god in the form of the Hindu deity ÊŸvara.⁄›ntideva’s Presentation of the Two RealitiesIn verse IX.2 of his Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life, ⁄›ntideva describesthe two realities as follows:The seeming and the ultimate—These are asserted as the two realities.The ultimate is not the sphere of cognition.It is said that cognition is the seeming.Here, “cognition” translates the Sanskrit term buddhi(Tib. blo), which has awide range of meanings. In its most general sense, it refers to the basic cognitivecapacity or intelligence of the mind, be it in sense perception or conceptual think-ing. More specifically—as outlined in detail in the teachings on valid cognition—this term is applied to all facets of the entire spectrum of consciousness, be theySome Remarks on the Bodhicary›vat›raand Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary605Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 605"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"conceptual or nonconceptual, ordinary or yogic. Both in this verse and in gen-eral, the usual translation of this term as “intellect” or “conception” suggests onlythe conceptual aspect of the mind.1448However, in the next verse, ⁄›ntidevaclearly refers to the entire way in which the world is seen:Thus, two kinds of world are seen:The one of yogins and the one of common people.1449Almost all commentaries explicitly state that the term “cognition” refers notonly to conceptual thinking but to all consciousnesses that entail the duality ofsubject and object; that is, it also applies to nonconceptual cognitions, such assense perception. Pawo Rinpoche says:Thus, the native nature of all phenomena was not, is not, and cannotbecome the sphere of the consciousnesses of any ordinary beings, nobleones, learners, or nonlearners whatsoever, be they conceptual or non-conceptual [consciousnesses], perceptions, or inferential cognitions.1450The SÒtra of Richly Adornedagrees:[The ultimate] is free from cognition and knowable objects.Measure and faculties have been relinquished.It is not the object of minds and consciousnesses.This is the object of those who are released.1451AtıŸa’s Entrance into the Two Realitiesdeclares:The learned master Bhavya saidThat the scriptures are clear about[The ultimate] being realized neither throughConceptual nor nonconceptual consciousnesses.1452Moreover, if it were just the intellect and its objects that constitute seeming real-ity, then sense perceptions and other nonconceptual consciousnesses would not beincluded in such a seeming reality. Either they would then have to be a third cat-egory of reality altogether or, if the definite number of only two realities is retained,sense perceptions and so on would have to be ultimate reality and thus the per-ceivers of the ultimate. As The SÒtra of the King of Meditative Concentrationsays:Neither the eye, the ear, nor the nose is valid cognition,Nor is the tongue, the body, or mental cognition valid cognition.606The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 606"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"If these sense faculties were valid cognition,Whom would the path of noble ones do any good?1453Prajñ›karamati’s commentary on The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Lifequotes The SÒtra of Engaging in the Two Realities:1454Devaputra, if ultimate reality were ultimately the sphere of body,speech, and mind, it would not fall into the category of “ultimate real-ity.” It would be nothing but just seeming reality. However, Devapu-tra, ultimate reality is beyond all conventions. Actually, it is unarisenand unceasing, free from any object of expression or means of expres-sion, free from knowable object and knower. It even transcends beingan object of the omniscient wisdom that is endowed with the supremeof all aspects. This is ultimate reality.1455As illustrated by such passages, the majority of sÒtras and all Indian com-mentaries on ⁄›ntideva’s text support the reading of the above verse on the tworealities as it was explained. Thus, no type of dualistic consciousness can per-ceive ultimate reality. Rather, it is often said that ultimate reality is seen by “per-sonally experienced wisdom.” There are two major objections that can be raisedhere:1) In general, in Buddhism, the terms “cognition” and “consciousness” are equiv-alent. Thus, if the ultimate is not the sphere of cognition, this contradicts theexplanation that the ultimate is the sphere of personally experienced wisdom.Thus, this verse cannot be taken literally.2) It follows that the ultimate is not a knowable object, because the definition ofknowable object is “that which is suitable to be taken as an object of a cogni-tion.”1456The first objection does not apply to ⁄›ntideva’s verse, as this verse is surelynot to be understood as negating that the personally experienced wisdom of thenoble ones sees the nature of phenomena just as it is. When all mistaken cling-ing has completely vanished, the nondual unity of expanse and awareness in themental continua of noble ones is without any conceptual entanglement. It is likea still pond when the wind has subsided: free from waves. In this unity of expanseand awareness, there are no reference points of subject and object. However, fol-lowing this meditative equipoise, the consciousness during the phase of subse-quent attainment applies the conventional terms “what is realized” and “whatrealizes” to expanse and awareness respectively. The expression “personally expe-rienced wisdom realizes the ultimate” is used solely in this way. On the otherSome Remarks on the Bodhicary›vat›raand Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary607Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 607"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"hand, in meditative equipoise, there are not even the most subtle characteristicsof cognition, such as realizing or not realizing. So how should any perceptualmode of self-awareness or a perceptual mode that is not self-awareness remainthere? With this in mind, the reason ⁄›ntideva did not assert personally experi-enced wisdom and such in this context was to reverse our clinging to character-istics with regard to the ultimate. Had he asserted personally experienced wisdomand such, it would be difficult to relinquish the Mere Mentalists’ clinging to theexistence of self-awareness. Moreover, from the perspective of debate, such anassertion would have amounted to a claim—such as “This is the self-awarenessthat we call the ultimate”—that could be attacked through reasoning. Also, onedoes not get any closer to the nature of phenomena merely by thinking, “The ulti-mate is the object of personally experienced wisdom.” On the other hand, theelimination of all characteristics of reference points does not become an obstacleto approaching the nature of phenomena via cultivating and refining a concep-tual mental image of the ultimate during the paths of accumulation and junction.The second objection also does not apply. To state the definition of knowableobject as “that which is suitable to be taken as an object of a cognition” is onlytaught in texts for beginners1457as a step in order to unfold their intelligence.However, these texts also give the definition of consciousness as “the cognitionthat is clear and aware of objects.” Thus, not only in terms of definition but alsoin the actual process of perception, consciousness and the object that it cognizesmutually depend on each other. Thus, one can never ascertain one of them with-out the other. In general, knowing consciousnesses and knowable objects areonly imagined by the ignorance of ordinary beings. Actually, there are no suchentities. When the Buddha used such labels, he did so only provisionally for cer-tain purposes, such as to communicate his teachings about ultimate reality.So then is the ultimate a knowable object or not? For beginners, the follow-ing is taught: Through knowing the seeming, one just cognizes worldly conven-tional terms and events, but this has no greater significance. Through knowingthe ultimate, one goes beyond cyclic existence. Therefore, the only correct objectto be known is the ultimate. However, again, this is said only for a specific pur-pose, which is to introduce beginners to the nominal ultimate. For those who arealready intensely trained in the path and then conceptualize the ultimate as athing with characteristics, it is taught that the ultimate is not even a mere know-able object, since knower and knowable object are just conventions on the levelof seeming reality. This is said in order to remove all mental reference pointsthat cling to the ultimate in terms of subject and object. If these are not removed,they function as subtle obstacles to “actually” perceiving the ultimate as it is. Thedirect cognition of the ultimate only engages in the nature of phenomena just asit is, when there are no more remainders of knower, knowable object, true see-ing, false seeing, and so on in such a cognition.608The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 608"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"In brief, existence, nonexistence, and so on are nothing but what is grasped atby the mind through certain modes of apprehension. No matter how cognitionsapprehend the nature of phenomena, this is not how it actually is. When analyzed,in principle, there is no phenomenon whatsoever that could be apprehended bycognition. Still, due to mistaken habituations, we imagine that we apprehendand seize “something,” although it is unreal. Thus, some intrinsic “existence” or“nonexistence” that is more than just an imaginary notion apprehended by cer-tain cognitions is impossible. As The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentionsays:Conditioned phenomena are neither conditioned nor unconditioned.As for unconditioned phenomena, they are also neither unconditionednor conditioned. O son of good family, “conditioned phenomena” arewords that are imputed by the Teacher. Words that are imputed by theTeacher originate from imagination and are expressed as conventionalterms. What is expressed as the conventional terms of various imagi-nations is not at all established.1458How does mind apprehend existence and nonexistence? To take an example,neither the horns of a cow nor the horns of a rabbit are real in the sense of intrin-sically existing or intrinsically nonexisting. Still, when we see these two things thatstand out from the head of a cow, we ascribe certain characteristics to them; wesay, “These are horns” and “There are horns on the head of this cow.” When wesee a rabbit later, we do not see on its head the things we saw on the cow’s head.Therefore, we ascribe the feature of nonexistence to the mere fact of not seeinghere and now what we saw somewhere else before and say, “There are no hornson the head of a rabbit.” So the common consensus that the horns of a cow existwhile the horns of a rabbit do not exist comes from common conventional expres-sions. If there is no cognition that apprehends the existence of horns on a cow inthe first place, there will also be no cognition that apprehends the nonexistenceof horns on a rabbit. Thus, we may apprehend what we imagine as existence ornonexistence, but none of this is real as some kind of intrinsic existence or nonex-istence apart from what appears to our mind. We may see a movie in which a cowand a rabbit appear, or we may dream of them, but once the movie stops or wewake up, we gain certainty that both the existence of the cow’s horns and thenonexistence of the rabbit’s horns were equally unreal. Even while watching sucha movie or a dream, there is not the slightest difference between the existence ofcow horns and the nonexistence of rabbit horns, or between the one being realand the other delusive. If even the very bases—cow and rabbit—to which weattribute certain features do not really exist in any way other than being mereappearances, what is there to say about any real specific features, such as the exis-tence or nonexistence of horns, that we attribute to these bases?Some Remarks on the Bodhicary›vat›raand Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary609Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 609"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"In this way, all our mental operations of imputing existence, nonexistence,entities, nonentities, being real or delusive, and so on are compared to tying knotsinto space. When these dissolve, there is nothing else that binds us. Thus, whatis conventionally called “seeing true reality” or “seeing the ultimate” is just likethe subsiding of our grasping at a mirage as being water. At this point, neither dowe see something that did not exist before nor does anything that existed beforecease. It is not that the water of the mirage dried up, nor that the nonexistenceof water is added. However, as long as our apprehension of this water has not dis-solved, we tire ourselves out trying to get there to drink it. As soon as we become“dis-illusioned” from this fantasy of water, we know that such efforts are point-less, and we relax.Again, the essential point here is to let go of our grasping that constantly super-imposes or denies something with regard to the display of mere appearances. Itis not a matter of annihilating or eradicating the appearance of things and pro-ducing some spacelike nothingness instead. As ⁄›ntideva says:How something is seen, heard, or knownIs not what is negated here.Rather, the object of refutationIs the cause for suffering, which is the conception of reality.1459When our clinging to a mirage as being water stops, this obviously does notdepend on whether or not the mere visual aspect of some shape and color thatlooks like water appears to us. Likewise, we now entertain ordinary worldly typesof consciousness that take whatever appears to be real in just the way that itappears. On the Buddhist path, we might furthermore try to make these appear-ances nonexistent through the remedy of a misunderstood and contrived empti-ness. Thus, we might cling to the ultimate as being like an extinguished flame orlike the empty space that is left after an old house has collapsed. Once both of thesemistaken cognitions—clinging to real existence or some kind of nonexistence—have subsided, in terms of the plain appearance of illusionlike phenomena whentheir specific causes have come together versus their nonappearance when theircauses are incomplete, there is no difference between the time when superimpo-sition and denial were still operating and the time when these have vanished.However, there is a difference as to whether the nature of these appearances is real-ized or not. Therefore, from the point of such realization onward, one is not underthe sway of either appearances or the lack thereof, much like someone who, whiledreaming, recognizes this dream as a dream and just enjoys its appearances. Thisis what it means to abide within cyclic existence without being affected by itsflaws, just like a lotus grows in muddy water without being stained by it.610The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 610"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"Since such realization is undeceiving, it is called “seeing what is true.” As it isthe opposite of worldly seeing, it may also be called “not seeing anything.” Sinceit is the opposite of reification, it is expressed as “seeing emptiness.” It is alsoreferred to as “being released from empty and nonempty,” because neither some-thing empty nor something nonempty is observed. Since emptiness is nothing buta name, it is also described as “not seeing emptiness.” Because it is the source ofall positive qualities, it is designated as “seeing the emptiness endowed with thesupreme of all aspects.” It is called “seeing identitylessness,” for it is the oppositeof clinging to personal and phenomenal identities. Since it is the opposite ofboth clinging to a self and clinging to the lack of a self, it is said to be “seeing thegenuine self.” As any notion of a mind has vanished, it is labeled as “mind hav-ing vanished.” It is also referred to as “realizing or seeing one’s own mind,”because the primordial basic nature of one’s own mind is realized in just the pri-mordial way it is. When “not seeing anything” is explained as “seeing what istrue,” this is to be understood just like our immediate certainty that we see spacewhen we do not see anything.

Since the Second Pawo Rinpoche was a disciple of the EighthKarmapa, his commentary preserves many of the Centrist pith instructions ofKarmapa Mikyö Dorje.Some Remarks on the Bodhicary›vat›raand Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary613Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 613"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"Of all the commentaries on ⁄›ntideva’s text, it is by far the most voluminous(975 folios). However, not only its length distinguishes it from other Tibetancommentaries. First, in terms of its scriptural sources, there is an unparalleledabundance of at times extensive quotes from the sÒtras to support the main pointsof the commentary. It is the only commentary that gives synopses of the relevantpassages from the major Indian commentaries for each topic of the text.1470Inaddition, it quotes a number of the earliest Tibetan commentaries, such as thosewritten by the Sakya master Sabsang Mati Panchen Jamyang Lodrö1471(1294–1376) and the Kadampa master Tsonaba Chenbo Sherab Sangbo1472(four-teenth century).In terms of its approach and contents, Pawo Rinpoche’s commentary gener-ally follows the Consequentialist brand of Madhyamaka. Usually, Centrist textsinstruct us in relinquishing all reference points but hardly mention what it mightbe like when the mind actually isfree from all reference points. Having followedthe thorough Centrist dissolution of reference points, unlike most other suchtexts, Pawo Rinpoche’s commentary also offers us a few glimpses of the experi-ence of a mind free from reference points. Thus, having made sure that there isno ground to stand on through the typical Consequentialist approach of relent-lessly pulverizing our ordinary world, he does not shy away from describing theresultant groundlessness in somewhat more positive, experiential terms. In thisway, he addresses the question of what happens when Centrist reasoning hasbeen successful in emptying our mind of its mistaken constructions and grasp-ing. Of course, by its very nature, the experiential ultimate result of the Centristpath is beyond imagination. However, it is clearly not a mere negation or blanknothingness. Rather, when both the objects of refutation and their remedy—reasoning—dissolve, they do so within the empty and luminous expanse of ourmind. From the perspective of this expanse, all analyses and their objects, includ-ing the mind that performs all these analyses, are still somewhat externally ori-ented and essentially dualistic. Finally, mind turns its looking “inside” toward thecenter of its own open space that is completely without direction or duality. Inthe words of Pawo Rinpoche:Apart from all phenomena just being mere imputations, they neitherabide as any nature whatsoever, nor do they abide as anything at all.Just this is what is seen as the very expanse of mind that is empty andluminous. This puts you in a position where you have complete powerover everything you could possibly wish for, just as if all phenomenawere resting in the palm of your hand. Thus, . . . compassion for theassembly of sentient beings who do not realize this in the same waywells up unbearably. . . . To the same extent that great compassion614The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 614"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"increases, also this very [realization] that, primordially, nothing canbe observed . . . grows and increases. This is the ultimate seeing whichis like the orb of the sun. When it becomes stable and increases in sucha way, great compassion—which is like the light rays of the sun—willgrow even more than before. [Beings with such realization] do notbehold sentient beings, but great compassion still flowers in them.They do not behold themselves either, but they still lend their supportto all sentient beings. They do not behold anything to be attainedwhatsoever, but they still establish beings in great enlightenment. Justas there is no place whatsoever to go to beyond space, they do notbehold anybody who would go somewhere beyond, but they still dis-play [the activity of] liberating sentient beings from cyclic existence.1473andOnce clinging in terms of superimposition and denial has come to anend in such a way, just this empty and luminous nature of phenom-ena in which there is nothing to be removed or to be added is the fun-damental state of phenomena. This is expressed as primordial nirv› ̊aas such.1474In addition to being a commentary on The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Wayof Life, Pawo Rinpoche’s text provides several long accounts on such topics asMadhyamaka in general, the distinction between Autonomists and Consequen-tialists, prajñ›, emptiness, the two realities, and the nature and qualities of Bud-dhahood. It decribes the four major Buddhist philosophical systems and howthe great vehicle represents the words of the Buddha. In addressing the issue ofso-called Shentong-Madhyamaka, he also elaborates on the lineage of vast activ-ity and shows that it is not the same as Mere Mentalism.As for the structure of Pawo Rinpoche’s specific commentary on the ninthchapter of The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life, its brief outline is pre-sented through five main points:1) Teaching the benefit of prajñ›, or knowledge (verse 1)2) Identifying the nature and scope of this knowledge (2–55)• Showing that everything that is contained in the two realities is emptiness(2–29)• Demonstrating that realizing emptiness constitutes the path of bodhisattvas(30–55)3) Outlining the actual way to meditate on emptiness (56–110)• Meditating on personal identitylessness (56–77)• Meditating on phenomenal identitylessness (78–110)Some Remarks on the Bodhicary›vat›raand Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary615Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 615"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"4) Refuting reification (111–150)• Showing that there are no means to prove the notion of real existence(111–115)• Teaching the means to invalidate this notion (116–150)5) The result of having meditated on emptiness (151–167)• Transcending cyclic existence through not being carried away by afflictions(151–155)• Not falling into the one-sided peace of nirv› ̊a through compassion(156–165)• Protecting all sentient beings (166–167)616The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 616"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"T8 The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary on The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of LifeExposition of The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of LifeThe Essence of the Immeasurable, Profound, and Vast Ocean of the Dharma of the Great VehicleThe Ninth Chapter on KnowledgeCompletely free from conceptions and concepts,Not an object of cognition, suchness,To her, this perfection of knowledge,I prostrate in the manner of such realization.Even the arising of doubt about herIs able to tear existence into shreds.I shall comment on the chapter on knowledgeThat elucidates inconceivable true reality.Through such efforts in perfect meditative stability [as explained in the eighthchapter], one manifests [the various types of] knowledge up to the knowledge oftermination and nonarising. Therefore, the explanation of the perfection ofknowledge follows right after [the explanation of] meditative stability.Here, VibhÒticandra says:Without meditative stability, knowledge does not originate.If calm abiding does not exist, this also does not exist.1475On this first [verse] that establishes the connection [with the preceding chap-ter], Kaly› ̊adeva [comments]:Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 617"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"Since from settling in meditative equipoise a cognition of true reality willarise . . .1476The Great Commentary on the Difficult Pointsreads:Because the perfection of knowledge that has the name superior insightis taught . . .1477The Small Commentary on the Difficult Points of the Knowledge Chapter Onlysays:Superior insight is taught after the explanation of meditative stabilitythat has the defining characteristic of representing the assembly of thecauses for the accumulation of merit, such as generosity, as well as thecause for the accumulation of wisdom, which is calm abiding. In orderto [teach] it . . .1478In this way, the connection [with the preceding chapters] is established.You might raise this objection: “It is stated, ‘Without superior insight, thereis also no calm abiding.’ But if superior insight is the topic of this chapter, then,since meditative stability must arise from superior insight, the order of the pre-vious and this [ninth] chapter [in ⁄›ntideva’s text] must be reversed. Or, other-wise, the mistake of mutually dependent conceptions1479would follow, becausesuperior insight does not arise without relying on calm abiding, and calm abid-ing too does not arise without relying on superior insight.”In those of sharpest faculties, superior insight that fully qualifies as such arisesfirst, and, through their settling one-pointedly in this with meditative equipoise,the purpose [of calm abiding] is fulfilled too. In those of weaker faculties, [642]1480calm abiding arises through settling [the mind] while focusing on merely partialsuperior insight. Through this, the knowledge that ensues from meditation—superior insight—increases further. On the basis of that, in turn, stable calmabiding comes about in the way that a bird flaps its [two] wings. In this way, uni-fied calm [abiding] and superior [insight] of the respective ground become verystable. Thus, one proceeds on the path of partial concordance with definite dis-tinction.1481Then, the knowledge of one single moment sees the nature of phenomena.This is the arising of the path of seeing, that is, [the arising] of superior insightthat fully qualifies as such. On the path of meditation, this very [insight] becomesmore and more stable in the form of unified calm [abiding] and superior [insight].Consequently, at the end of the seventh ground, superior insight with pure obser-vation in [meditative] equipoise and subsequent [attainment] arises.Since this becomes [even] more stable, all meditative concentrations are per-618The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 618"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"fected. At the end of the continuum of the tenth ground, one-pointed medita-tive concentration and the knowledge that knows extinction and nonarising—theknowledge that knows the means for the extinction of contaminations—areinseparable. This is the vajralike meditative concentration that vanquishes allstains so that they never arise [again]. This is true and perfect enlightenment ofall phenomena through the knowledge of one single moment. It is the unwan-ing achievement of the inseparability of ultimate calm abiding—not rising fromthe great cessation—and ultimate superior insight—the knowledge of the such-ness and the extent [of phenomena].Therefore, both calm [abiding] and superior [insight] have limitless subdivi-sions on each [ground], starting from a beginner with very weak faculties upthrough the ground of a Buddha. When specified in terms of [different] sentientbeings, the development of calm [abiding] and superior [insight] in individualpersons is something that should be guided by spiritual friends according to theconstitutions and faculties of these [individuals]. However, nobody is able towrite down all the possible ways of doing so.This means that these [calm abiding and insight] are just taught in a very gen-eral manner in terms of the main issues. Therefore, the meditative concentrationthat focuses on approximately concordant superior insight is called meditative sta-bility. That which is generated through this, that is, [643] the actual knowledgethat sees true reality, [is called] superior insight. Thus, they are taught in themanner of cause and effect.The actual text has five parts:1) The benefit of knowledge2) The identification of knowledge3) The way to meditate on emptiness4) The refutation of reification5) The result of meditating on emptiness1. The Benefit of KnowledgeAll of these branchesWere taught by the Sage for the sake of knowledge.Therefore, those who wish for sufferingTo subside should develop knowledge. [1]1482All of thesefive branches, such as generosity, were taught by the Sage, theBlessed One, solely for the sake ofdeveloping the main body or result, knowl-edge. This is the case because the result—the accumulation of wisdom (knowl-edge)—arises from the cause—the accumulation of merit, which is the fiveThe Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .619Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 619"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"[perfections], such as generosity.

You might disagree andsay, “This contradicts the explanation that one needs knowledge before [onedevelops] the five [perfections], such as generosity:As for generosity, knowledge is that which precedes generosity.Ethics, patience, vigor, and meditative stability are just like that.”This refers to the five [perfections], such as plain generosity, which are like [peo-ple] who are born blind. If they are led by a guide—knowledge—they will alsobecome [true] perfections. Therefore, this teaches that they need knowledge inorder to be presentable as [true] perfections.

The Classification of the Two RealitiesThe seeming and the ultimate—These are asserted as the two realities. [2ab]The nature of these [two realities] has already been taught extensively in thegeneral topics of the fourth chapter. Still, a brief summary is given here:That which is to be understood are the seemingreality and the ultimatereal-ity: Thesetemporary knowable objects are definitely accepted as the two reali-tiesby the great being ⁄›ntideva himself when he says “asserted.”In this context, [the etymology of “seeming” (literally “all-deceptive”) is as fol-lows:] “All” is a plural and has the meaning of [all phenomena] that appear in var-ious forms. “Deceptive” has the meaning of delusive: This means that since[appearances] are not real in the way that they appear, they are nothing but merevanities, nullities, and insignificances.You might wonder, “Why then is the seeming presented as a reality?” This is[done] provisionally for the sake of conventions in order to guide the world. Itis presented as a provisional reality, because worldly people cling to [appearances]as being real in just the way that they appear, and also because causes and resultsappear to perform their functions unmistakenly from the perspective of provi-sional reasoning. It is not a stable reality, [however,] because it does not withstandanalysis and because it does not appear as an object of the meditative equipoiseof the noble ones.[The etymology of “ultimate” (literally “supreme object”) is as follows:] It iscalled “object” because one engages in the fundamental nature in dependence onthe seeming, and because it is what is to be strived for. It is “supreme” because itis essential for those who wish for liberation and undeceiving with respect to theresult, which is Buddhahood. Thus, it is a term for [such] a common locus.Through this [etymology], [645] the assertion [of others] that “ultimately real”is a term for a basis of attribution and an attribute is also eliminated.This [ultimate reality] is what abides as the actual nature of all phenomena. Itis the object of the profound meditative equipoise of noble ones. Therefore, it ispresented as a stable reality in dependence on the seeming. [However,] it is not[such a stable reality] independently through its nature, because the Buddhasthemselves behold neither real nor delusive phenomena.(The word “and” [in line 2a] is both a term that differentiates “the seeming andthe ultimate which is other than that” and a collective term [indicating that]“both of these are equal insofar as they are just realities.”)The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .621Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 621"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"2.1.2. Their DefinitionsThe ultimate is not the sphere of cognition.It is said that cognition is the seeming. [2cd]You might say, “However, in this dichotomy of the two realities, what is ulti-mate reality and what is seeming reality?”[The first one] is that for which it does not matter whether Buddhas havearrived or not; it is what could not be contrived even by the Buddha. He taught:Even I did not behold it, do not behold it, and will not behold it.Thus, the native nature of all phenomena was not, is not, and cannot become thesphere of the consciousnesses of any ordinary beings, noble ones, learners, ornonlearners whatsoever, be they conceptual or nonconceptual [consciousnesses],perceptions, or inferential cognitions. For this expanse of dharmas just as it is, theconventional term “ultimate reality” is used.You might object, “What do you mean? If it is not an object of any con-sciousness whatsoever, one is not even able to focus on it. Therefore, how can itat the same time be presented as the ultimate?” In general, in all this labelingwith conventional terms, it is not the case that the direct observer of a given phe-nomenon is doing the labeling. [For example,] when one labels [something] withthe conventional term “blue utpala,”1485the observer of that is a [visual] senseconsciousness. But this [consciousness itself] does not conceive of the attributethat is the name “utpala” or the attribute “blue color,” [646] because it is noth-ing but mere direct and nonconceptual experiencing.That which labels with conventional terms is a subsequent apprehending con-ception of this [direct experience]. This [involves] the presumption that the pre-ceding nonconceptual sense consciousness—the [actual] experiencer—is theapprehending conception itself. By apprehending the object—the mere utpala[flower]—as something else, the [subsequent conception] conceives of it as nameand color while presuming, “I see this.” [This] is like a carpenter who presumes,“I have made this” with respect to a clay pot that was made by a potter.Also, when one thoroughly analyzes a continuum on the seeming level, [onefinds that] the utpala at the time when it is seen and the utpala at the time whenit is [conceptually] apprehended are different entities. Furthermore, the senseconsciousness that experiences it and the apprehending conception are differententities [as well]. They are just like a stream of water. If perception does not con-ceive of the object and conception does not experience it, which consciousnessfocuses on what kind of utpala? [This is the point here,] because, if one analyzes,this is nothing but seeing utter mistakenness.622The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 622"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"For example, when one [mentally] analyzes the Brahm› world, [such an inves-tigation] is nothing but an analysis through imagining [this world within] one’sown cognition that thinks, “The Brahm› world is something like this.” [Thus,]this [cognition] possesses the aspect of an object generality in the form of theBrahm› world. However, through that, the Brahm› world does not come here,and neither does the analyst go to the Brahm› world. Hence, this [type of analy-sis] mistakes the analysis of one’s own mind through one’s own mind for [anactual analysis when one directly faces the Brahm› world and thus may say,] “Ianalyze the Brahm› world.” Consequently, [even] focusing on the ultimate isalso nothing but this kind of [mistakenness]. Therefore, the ultimate isdefi-nitely not the sphere of cognition.You might say, “However, since the seeming is also nothing different, it is notthe sphere of cognition.” [Ultimately,] this is very true indeed. Therefore, it is def-initely stated that all phenomena have one single reality and that just this that iscalled “real” or “delusive” is not observed. Nevertheless, in order for naïve beingsto be able to leave their fear behind, the provisional presentation of subject andobject [647] is [given as] something that leaves the status quo of mere commonworldly consensus as it is. Thus, naïve beings are guided by using the conven-tional term “seeming reality.”You might wonder, “Why is the ultimate not the sphere of cognition?” Becauseit is assertedthat cognition,or consciousness, is thevery seemingand it is impos-sible for the seeming to take the ultimate as its object.[You continue,] “Through what is it certain that the ultimate is not an objectof cognition?” This is certain through the reasoning of the inconceivable natureof phenomena. When the great noble ones settle in meditative equipoise withinthe expanse of dharmas, then this becomes all the more subtle and inconceivablethe more they settle [within it]. This is so for the following reasons: That verysomething that is settled in meditative equipoise and the one who settles it willsubside, while one is not able to realize a limit of the expanse of dharmas. Eventhe Thus-Gone Ones do not state any extent of the expanse of dharmas.Thus, it is seen that the expanse of dharmas is not an object of speech, reflec-tion, or expression. It is for just this [type of seeing] that the conventional terms“penetrating the nature of phenomena” and “beholding ultimate reality” are used.The conventional term “personally experienced wisdom” is then used for thevery knowledge that does not observe the characteristics of discursiveness in termsof subject and object. Thus, the nature of phenomena is not seen through appre-hending a subject and an object. Rather, if one knows that subject and object arenot observable, one engages in the nature of phenomena. Therefore, [the expres-sion] “personally experienced wisdom realizes the nature of phenomena” is a con-ventional term that is used based on something else. However, in no way does thisabide in the mode of subject, object, something to be realized, and a realizer inThe Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .623Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 623"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"the way that these are imputed by cognition.

Establishing the Two RealitiesThus, two kinds of world are seen:The one of yogins and the one of common people.[648]Here, the world of common peopleIs invalidated by the world of yogins. [3]Also the yogins, due to differences in insight,Are overruled by successively superior ones [4ab]You might object, “Of course, the seeing of ordinary beings is not ultimate.Nevertheless, since the ultimate is the direct object of the noble ones, it is rea-sonable that the vision of the noble ones is ultimate.” In order to teach the answerto that, [the text says]: Thus,in theworld, two kinds ofthe seeming are seen:theseeing of commonworldly people and theseeing of yoginswho have enteredthe [Buddhist] path.Here, common worldly people are of two [kinds]: average individuals who arenot engaged in philosophical systems and non-Buddhists who are engaged inphilosophical systems. As for yogins, there are many types, classified by the pro-ponents of the four [Buddhist] philosophical systems, the five paths, and the tengrounds on [the paths of] seeing and meditation.For [all of] them, [it is true] that the seeing of the respective former ones isinvalidated by the reasonings of the respective following ones. This is the case forthe following reasons: The assertions of individuals who are not engaged in philo-sophical systems are invalidated by the reasonings of those non-Buddhists whoare engaged in philosophical systems, that is, those non-Buddhists who aretrained in linguistics and valid cognition and who regard the others as just likecattle. [On the other hand,] the [Buddhist] seers take people who cling to asser-tions as their objects of compassion.Here, common peoplemay be engaged in philosophical systems or not,butthey all cling to the five aggregates as being clean, an identity, blissful, and per-manent. Their world is invalidated by the world ofthe Buddhist yoginswho arethe Followers of the Great Exposition, that is, through their reasonings of theseeming level that demonstrate that [the aggregates] are unclean, identityless,suffering, and impermanent.Also, as for the yoginsthemselves, due tothe greatdifferences inhigher orlower insightthat exist [among them]—such as having purified their continua624The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 624"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"or not, or being of sharp or weak faculties—the assertions of the respectivelyinferior ones are overruled bythe reasonings ofsuccessively superior ones. [649][As a consequence, the former] are not able to give answers that are concordantwith the dharma.The assertion of the Followers of the Great Exposition that object and con-sciousness [actually] meet is invalidated by the SÒtra Followers’ reasoning thatnegates the lack of an aspect. The assertion of both the Followers of the GreatExposition and the SÒtra Followers that specifically characterized referents andconsciousnesses are substantially established is invalidated by the Mere Mental-ists’ reasoning that refutes outer objects. The assertion of the Mere Mentalists thatmind is real is invalidated by the Centrists’ [reasonings of] “freedom from unityand multiplicity” and “the negation of arising from the four possibilities.”Surely the emptiness of the Centrists is not deliberately hit by invalidationsthrough reasoning. Nevertheless, during the phase of engagement throughdevoted interest with [its stages of] heat, peak, patience, and supreme [phemo-menon] and during direct engagement in this [emptiness] on the ten grounds, thepresumptions that any previous seeing [of emptiness] was perfect become just likegames of little children when the respectively following [kinds of seeing] areattained. Even the manner in which someone on the tenth ground beholds[emptiness] does not remain on the ground of a Buddha. Therefore, [emptiness]is not an object of the cognitions of hearers, solitary realizers, and bodhisattvas.Due to the complete change of state of the five aggregates, the Thus-Gone Onesdo not have any flux of discriminations. Hence, [emptiness] is also not an objectof [something like the] cognition of Buddhas, because they do not have [such athing as] cognition.You might say, “It is an object of the knowledge [of a Buddha].” Since true,perfect enlightenment of all phenomena in every way has been found, no otherobject that is something to be known is left over. Furthermore, since such aknowledge without something to be known is untenable, ultimately, Buddhas donot have anything called “knowing” or “not knowing” at all.2.1.4.

[5][650] You might argue, “However, if all cognitions were mistaken, con-sciousnesses that apprehend form and such would be completely nonexistent,since mistakenness is something nonexistent itself. If this were the case, it wouldbe impossible for forms, sounds, and such to appear.”Forms, sounds, and such as well as the cognitions that apprehend them are notentities that appear due to the fact that they exist. Rather, they are solely entitiesthat appear through the delusive appearance of dependently originating collec-tions and do not [really] exist. This is the case because one is able to illustrate itthrough examples,such as illusions and dreams, that are unanimouslyassertedas entities that appear while not existing by bothcommon people and yogins, orproponents and opponents.Again, you might say, “If all cognitions were mistaken, then even the five per-fections, such as the mental state of generosity, would not be the path.” They rep-resent the cause—the accumulation of merit—from which the result—theaccumulation of wisdom—arises. Since Buddhahood is attained due to these[two accumulations], for the time being, while not analyzingwhether they arereal, delusive, existent, or nonexistent, one engages in them by means of the merecorrect seeming,which servesto attain this state [of Buddhahood]. Thus, thereis no mistake here.In brief, worldly people—whether they are engaged in philosophical systemsor not—think, “Things, such as forms, are real injust this way thatwe seethem.”Thus, these[people] conceivemere appearances and experiences as facts, butdonotunderstand themas entities that do not withstand analysis nor as illusion-like[phenomena] that appear but are without nature. Here, in this explanationthat [things] are illusionlike,the dispute between yogins and worldly peoplehas its start. As [the sÒtras] state:Sentient beings like abodes and wish for objects.To abide in grasping and be foolishly ignorant without any skill is likedarkness.The dharma to be attained is without abiding and without grasping.Therefore, dispute happens in the worlds.andThe world disputes with me, but I [651] do not dispute with the world.626The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 626"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"2.1.4.2.

Removing Contradictions to Valid CognitionAlso perceptions of forms and suchAre based on common consensus and not on valid cognition.This is delusive, just as the common consensusThat something unclean is clean and so on. [6]You might think, “Forms, sounds, and such factually exist, because they aredirectly experienced.” Also perceptions ofseeing forms and such arenothingbut the arising of cognitions that [perceive] these [objects], which is [in itselfentirely] based onmere commonworldly consensus.This means that such [per-ception] is [just something that comes from our] habituation through clinging tosuccessive chains [of events] and notsomething that is established through validcognition.This is like the following: Because of one’s habituation to latent ten-dencies of apprehending water, clinging to water arises even when one sees an illu-sory river. Also The SÒtra of the King of Meditative Concentrationsays:Neither the eye, the ear, nor the nose is valid cognition,Nor is the tongue, the body, or mental cognition valid cognition.If these sense faculties were valid cognition,Whom would the path of noble ones do any good?1486The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .627Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 627"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"In The Great Commentary, one finds the following quotation [from N›g›r -juna’sPraise to the Inconceivable]:If just this that the sense faculties observeWere true reality,Naïve beings would be aware of true reality.So what would be the point of realizing true reality then?1487Therefore, one grasps at something that [merely] appears while it does notexist [and takes it] to be something that is directly [652] seen. This is just as thecommon consensus thatan unclean thing—such as the body, which is the sourceof feces and urine—is clean.The term “and so on” includes [other cases of com-mon consensus, for example, the notion that] an impermanent thing like waterthat flows downward is a permanent water stream. Such is of an unreal anddelu-sivenature.2.1.4.2.2. Removing Contradictions to ScriptsureFor the sake of introducing worldly people,The protector taught in terms of entities.In actuality, these are not momentary phenomena.You might object, “On the seeming level, they are incompatible.” [7]There is no flaw in that they are the seeming of yogins.When compared to worldly people, this refers to seeing true reality.Otherwise, the ascertainmentThat women are impure would be invalidated by the world. [8]The Followers of the Great Exposition and the SÒtra Followers in our own[Buddhist] faction might say, “If forms and such were not existing, that wouldcontradict the Buddha’s statement that conditioned phenomena are momentary.”For the sake of introducing worldly peopleto true reality, the protector merelytaught in terms of entitiesin order to counteract coarse conceptions of reality:All conditioned phenomena are momentary. You should not rely onthem.However, this is not a statement that [phenomena] are established as some-thing momentary. For example, it is like when one says, “This is illusory water.”This points out that [what appears] is illusory, yet it does not point out that [thisappearance] is established as water.

Thus, it follows that either they are notincluded in the two realities [653] or they are a third reality.” Although momen-tary phenomena are not the seeming of worldly people, they are the seeming ofyogins.Thus, there is no flaw.You might say, “This contradicts the Buddha’s statement that seeing momen-tary phenomena is seeing reality.” It is not contradictory, because it is stated that,when compared tothe seeming of worldly people, this refers to seeing the truerealityof these [phenomena].You might say, “It is unjustified to present the seeming of yogins.” Yet it is jus-tified, because if it were not presented [as the seeming of yogins], the ascertain-mentand vision that women are impureand [nothing but] skeletons—which iswhat yogins [see] who are familiar with [the meditation on the body’s] repul-siveness—would have to be presented as the seeming of worldly people. However,in this case, the [yogic understanding] would be invalidated by common worldlyconsensus, that is, by the worldthat apprehends bathed women as pure andbeautiful.14892.1.4.2.3.

Therefore, what is the point of bodhisattva conduct?”Here we say: There is no difference between Buddhas and sentient beings interms of being pure by nature. However, on the seeming level, there is a differ-ence as to whether they circle in cyclic existence or not. This is the case becausein Buddhas the continuum of conditions for cyclic existence—such as basicunawareness, craving, and grasping—has been [permanently] interrupted,whereas in sentient beings [656] the continuum of these [conditions] has notbeen interrupted. Therefore, this is the same as [with illusions]: If the continuumof its conditions is not interrupted, even an illusion will not cease. However,if the continuum of conditionsfor an illusion is interrupted,the illusion will notmanifest even on the seeming level.2.1.4.2.7. Removing the Consequence That an Illusion Would Not Exist Even on the Seeming Level“When even mistakenness does not exist,What would observe the illusion?” [15cd][657] These two lines present the objection that it follows that an illusion is notobserved unless mistakenness exists.1492The Proponents of Cognizance argue, “Although it is certainly true that outerobjects are without nature, this explanation of illusions and such by you Centristsas examples that are held in common by both debaters does not apply to your-selves: When you claim that even mistakenness does not exist, what wouldobserve the veryillusion?That is, where should the illusion exist, if mistakennessdoes not exist?”When, according to you, the illusion itself does not exist,What is observed? [16ab]These two lines express the equal applicability of this [reasoning].We answer you Mere Mentalists: When, according to you,even the illusionitself does not exist, whatexample of an illusion is observed, since you yourselvesassert that outer objects do not exist? Thus, the entailment [of your objection inlines 15cd] [658] applies equally [to your own position].1493632The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 632"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"You might say, “It is an aspect of mind itself,Even though there is something other in terms of its ownstate.” [16cd]These two lines present the assertion of the Real Aspectarians.1494The Real Aspectarians might say, “Illusions and such do not exist as outerobjects. However, there is something other in terms of the plain own stateofthese examples, such as illusions, that is, an aspect that appears as this [illusion].It is an aspect that is [only] real as that for which [the illusion] appears, that is,mind itself.”Once mind itself is the illusion,Then what is seen by what?The protector of the world has declared,“Mind does not see mind.” [17]Just as the blade of a swordCannot cut itself, so it is with the mind. [18ab]These one and a half verses refute self-awareness in general.If outer objects do not exist, it is contradictory that aspects of outer objectsexist. It is certainly the case that this is just as unreasonable as the differencebetween the nonexistence of the horns of a rabbit and the existence of their aspect.[Moreover,] the mind itself too entails dependence, does not withstand analysis,and is like an illusion, because it was declared that [everything] from form upthrough omniscience is [that way], and if there existed a phenomenon superiorto nirv› ̊a, then this [phenomenon] as well would be illusionlike. Therefore,onceeven mind itself is illusionlike, then whatobject to be seen is seen by whatseer? [There is no such object,] because there is nothing to be seen other thanmind, and mind does not see itself.This is also established through reasoning, because it is contradictory that agiven thing is itself [both] object and agent, and because something to be seen anda seer do not meet in the same place simultaneously when those who are involvedin yoga internally examine their own minds. This becomes more profound andsubtle in direct proportion to the extent to which it is examined, until finally thevery discursiveness of something to be seen and something that sees subsides.This is like when one [tries to] gauge the proportions of the width and the cir-cumference of [the flame of] a butter lamp with a thread, during which the threaditself is burned. Thus, this leaves one unable to determine the size [of the flame].This is established through scripture too, because the protector of the worldhas declaredin The SÒtra Requested by Crown Jewel:The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .633Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 633"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"Mind does not see mind.1495He stated that, just as the blade of a sword cannot cut itself, so it isalso withthesingle mindthat [cannot] simultaneously be the triad of the object to beseen, the seer, and the seeing. This is so because he said in [The SÒtra of ] theArrival in Laºka:Just as a sword and its own blade [659]Or just as a finger and its own tipDo not cut or touch [themselves],Likewise, mind does not see mind.1496If it were just like a lampThat perfectly illuminates its own entity, [18cd]The lamp is nothing to be illuminated,Because it is not obscured by darkness.“Just like the blue of something like a crystalAnd blueness that does not depend on something other, [19]Some things are seen to depend on othersAnd some to be independent.”What is not blueCannot make itself blue by itself. [20]You might say, “A lamp is said to illuminateOnce this is known by a consciousness.”Upon being known by what do you stateThat cognition is illuminating? [21]Once this is not seen by anything,“Illuminating” and “not illuminating”Are like the looks of a barren woman’s daughter—Even if described, they are meaningless. [22]These four and a half verses refute the assertion of self-illumination.The Proponents of Cognizance might answer to the [above], “Just like a lampis self-illuminating, since itself perfectly illuminates its entityof [being a] lamp,the mind too is self-illuminating.” [The refutation of] this is explained as follows:This is an example that does not apply. “Illuminating” means that some form is634The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 634"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"illuminated by having ended darkness. This is presented as the conventionalexpression that a lamp illuminates [something]. But the lampitself doesnotneedto be illuminated, because the lamp is not obscured by darkness.The Funda-mental Verses on Centrismsays:In a lamp and whereverIt stands, there is no darkness.How does a lamp light up [things]?It is something that lights up by eliminating darkness.1497Furthermore, if a lamp were self-illuminating, one would have to assert that itlights up other things too. If that were the case, then darkness would obscure bothitself and others:If a lamp did light upItself and other things,Then there is no doubt that also darknessWould obscure itself and other things.1498The Proponents of Cognizance might answer, “There is no mistake: Some-thing like atranslucent crystalis not blue, but it appears to be bluethrough thecondition of blue silk being close [to it]. This is [a case of an] illumination thatdepends on other conditions. And[on the other hand, there is] the bluenessofsuch things as an utpala [flower] that does not depend on some otherconditionsbut is naturally blue. Just likethis, somephenomena are seen to depend onotherconditions,and some[are seen] to be independentjust as they are by theirvery nature. Therefore, consciousness does not depend on other conditions butis self-illuminating by its very nature.”The refutation of this is [threefold]:[Natural] blue is not a concordant example for self-awareness, [660] because,first, the blue of an utpala has certainly not primordially existed as blue by its verynature. Rather, it has been produced as blue through other causes and condi-tions, such as the translucence of the elements. However, self-awareness has notbeen produced as something self-illuminating by causes and conditions. Fur-thermore, awareness depends on something that it is aware of and somethingthat is aware, while illumination depends on the phase of nonillumination.Therefore, once there are [such] counterparts to depend on, self-illuminatingself-awareness is not established due to the mistake of mutually dependent con-ceptions.1499And if there are no counterparts to depend on, it would be even lessestablished than if there were.[Second, the example of the crystal is also not concordant] because of the fol-The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .635Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 635"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"lowing: A crystal may certainly appear blue through such conditions as silk or acolored glass vessel [next to it]. However, this is nothing but seeing the color ofthe silk or the colored glass vessel in an unobscured way because of the translu-cence of the crystal, whereas the crystal [itself] did not become blue.[Third, this example is furthermore not concordant] because, even throughthese conditions, what is not blue—the crystal—cannot be made into abluecrystal and the crystal cannot make itself blue by itselfeither.All of this is certainly true, but we still ask, upon being known by whom it isstated that the lamp illuminates? You might say, “Such is said once this [illu-mination] is known by a consciousness.” However, upon being known by whatdo you state that cognition is illuminating?You will affirm, “This is [known]by self-awareness.” [However, in this case, your reason, which is self-awareness,]which [should] prove [the probandum], is equivalent to the probandum, so proveself-awareness itself!1500“If self-awareness did not exist,How would consciousness be recollected?”Recollection comes from the connection with other experiences,Just as with the rat’s poison. [23]You might say, “Since it sees through its association withother conditions,Self-awareness is self-illuminating.”Through applying the eye lotion of accomplishment,You see the vase and not the eye lotion itself. [24]These two verses refute [the attempt to] prove self-awareness.The Proponents of Cognizance might ask, “If self-awareness did not exist,how woulda previously experienced consciousness be recollectedlater?” TheCentrists say: Such recollection is not due to the existence of self-awareness. Atthe given time, the arising of a recollectionthat focuses on a previous situationcomes from theinfluencingconnection with experiencing other causes and con-ditions.1501However, this is nothing but mistaking a present experience for a pre-vious situation. However, this [recollection] is not the previous situation itself,because that has already ceased. It is never and nowhere possible that somethingthat has ceased could arise again.Therefore, [661] this isjust as withthe [following story]: Once upon a time,a snake proudly said [to a rat], “I seize people with powerful poison and makethem afraid by doing that, but nobody is afraid of someone like you.” To that,the rat answered, “It is not your poison [that makes them afraid] but just their636The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 636"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"thoughts. If you do not believe me, I will show you.” They both sat beside theroad. When a man came by, the rat bit his foot without him noticing it, whilethe snake showed itself to him. This made the man [cry out], “I have beenstricken by the poison of a snake.” He fainted and writhed on the ground.Another man came by, and the snake bit him without the man seeing it, whilethe rat pretended to be the one who had bitten him. Then the man said, “Whywould anyone be afraid after being bitten by a rat?” (The [corresponding] thought“Nothing really went wrong at all” is also well known to many people practicingmeditative stability.)When such a recollection has arisen that involves the concern that one hasbeen poisoned, great harm is produced through the notion that the bite of the ratis the [deadly] poison[ous bite] of the snake. On the other hand, when one hasthe notion that the attack by the snake is [just]the rat’s[mildly] poison[ousbite], there is no harm.1502This fits well with the following statement:For example, through one’s anxious assumptions,One will faint, although the poison is gone and did not enter inside.Here, Kaly› ̊adeva has explained the meaning of this example in the followingway:This is connected to the question “How will the poison of the rat berecollected?” When in the summertime rats become poisonous andone realizes that they are around, then right after one has been seizedby the fangs of a snake, one may not see the snake but sees the harm-ful changes [caused by its poison] in one’s body. Therefore, while thereis no poison of a rat, a [seeming] recollection that one has been seizedby the poison of that [rat] certainly does happen, whereas the poisonof the snake is definitely something other than that. While there areonly the wounds or other discomforts, but no consciousness of a rat’spoison, still [such] a recollection [arises]. Similar to this, what isexpressed as the very absence of self-awareness [662] constitutes theorigination of a recollection of consciousness.1503YouProponents of Cognizance might say, “Through its association withother conditions, such as meditative concentration, self-illuminating self-aware-ness isexistent, since it [then]seesits own knowledge of the minds of others andrecollections of previous situations of oneself and others.” Though one may knowthe minds of others and such, through this one does not see [one’s] own mind.The reason is that [this is similar to the following example:] just through seeingforms, the eye does not see the eye itself. It is like this: Through applyingsuchThe Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .637Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 637"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"things as a concoction of the eye lotion of accomplishment—administeringwarmth, smoke, and blazing light to the eyes—you seeand obtain theexcellent[treasure] vase, jewels, and such that exist far away below the earth and so forth.However, you do notsee the eye lotion itselfthat was administered to the eyeor the eye itself.1504You might continue, “The very consciousness that recollects previous situa-tions and such is self-illuminating, because it has arisen as something that has thenature to be illuminated through the condition of meditative concentration.”However, then it follows that also the [treasure] vase would be an eye with theeye lotion, because it has arisen as something that has the nature to be illuminatedthrough the condition of the eye. Therefore, [all of] the following are superim-positions: the object of awareness itself, what is aware of it (consciousness), andthe way of being aware (apprehension in an illuminating way). Rather, this veryconsciousness does not exist as something that would rise as all three of thesesimultaneously.How something is seen, heard, or knownIs not what is negated here.Rather, the object of refutationIs the cause for suffering, which is the conception of reality. [25]This one verse teaches that the object of negation is solely the clinging to reality.It might be said, “However, when self-awareness does not exist, then aware-ness of something other is not justified either. Therefore, all experiences of con-sciousness and all experiences of forms, sounds, and such would not be justified.”The knowledges of howthey are experienced—such as seeing forms and hearingsounds—arenot what is negated herein this context of analyzing true reality.1505Rather, the object of refutation is solely the cause forthe sufferingof cyclicexistence, which is theclinging to the realityof such [phenomena] as the con-sciousnesses that see and hear. [663]This corresponds to what the Mere Mentalists do when they negate the outerobjects [that] the proponents of outer objects [assert]: They do not prove that,as by deaf and blind people, forms are not seen and sounds are not heard, but theysolely negate the grasping at forms and sounds as real. Also here, the mere expe-rience of illuminating consciousness is not negated, but the grasping that this isestablished as the experience of illumination is negated. Therefore, we cannot berebutted with such [an objection as the one above]. However, if we state thereverse [of your objection] to you Proponents of Cognizance by saying, “Whenawareness of something other does not exist, then self-awareness would not existeither,” then you lack an answer.638The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 638"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"If an illusion is not something other than mindAnd is not conceived as not something other either,Then, if it is an entity, how could it not be something other?If you say, “It is not something other,” [mind] would notexist as an entity.

So ifyou assert that it cannot be expressed as [mind]itself nor as something other, what is left [that would justify] to rebut us by[adducing lines 15cd] “When even mistakenness does not exist . . .” because youyourselves have accepted [then] that an illusion does not exist.They might say, “We did not accept this, but since it was accepted by others[in this verse], we will [accept] it here.” Then you should also accept that all phe-nomena are without nature, because others accept this.Well,then, ifyou assert that an illusion is an entity, how could it not besomething otherthan mind? In fact, it must be something other than mind. Youmight say, “Why?” [It is something other] because an illusion depends on beingmagically created by an illusionist with [certain] substance mantras, whereas con-sciousness does not depend on an illusionist. If youassert, “An illusion is notsomething otherthan mind,” then, since these two are not different, mind wouldnot exist as an entity, [664] because illusions [too] do not exist as entities.Wanting to remove this objection to their [position], they might try, “An illu-sion is not real, but it is the common consensus of the world that it isstill justsomething that can be seen.”Well, that is fine, but you should know that alsothe mind that sees [it] is not real as anything—such as self-awareness—and thatit is merely in terms of common consensus that it is the seer.The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .639Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 639"},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"2.1.4.2.8.

The other[nature] is [667] the object of those who are endowed with the eyes ofperfect knowledge [that result] from the elimination of the membraneof basic unawareness with the ophthalmological scalpel of completedistinction. This is [the object] of the perfect knowledge of the nobleones who are aware of true reality. Thus, it is presented as the [actual]nature.1512Thus, [this commentary] explains the seeing of naïve beings as the seeming andthe seeing of the noble ones as the ultimate. [It continues:]You might say, “That may well be the case. However, since the seem-ing is displayed through basic unawareness, it is of the nature of a falsesuperimposition. Hence, if it disintegrates hundreds of times due tothorough analysis, how could it be a reality?” You are absolutely right.However, it is [only] due to the clinging of worldly people that suchis expressed as “seeming reality.” It is just worldly people who assert a“seeming reality.” In compliance with this, [whenever] the BlessedOne spoke about the “seeming reality,” he did so by setting aside truereality. This is why master [N›g›rjuna] in his treatise [called The Fun-damental Verses on Centrism] said:Worldly seeming reality . . . 1513Actually, there is just a single [reality], which is ultimate reality.

The vajra-like meditative concentration that focuses on the ultimate that is [both]naturally [pure] and pure of adventitious stains is Buddhahood.

This [vajralike meditativeconcentration] is also not the phase in which all phenomena are presented as thenature of Buddhahood.Furthermore, [concerning the example of the illusionist,] he says:The people [in the audience] see nothing but the manner in whichthese magically created elephants and so on [appear], whereas themagician sees [them] as just wood and such.1524The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .645Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 645"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"[However, this explanation] is not appropriate, because if a magician were tosee [his magical creations] as [just] wood, the [opponent’s] answer in the [later]debate [in lines 30cd]Attachment for an illusory womanMight arise even in her very creatorwould become meaningless.About killing illusory human beings [in lines 11ab], he says:The actual part of taking life does not occur, because [illusory humanbeings] do not have any life. [However,] the negativity of beatingthem, which leads to [this killing], does happen.1525[This phrase] is not nice, because it is a joke that there should be no negativitythrough killing whereas there is negativity through beating. Some might stillargue, “This is due to the wish to beat.” Well, then why should the wish to killnot produce negativity?Therefore, if one kills [illusory beings] with the knowledge that an illusion isan illusion, since there is no motivation in terms of the wish to kill that reallyqualifies as such [a wish to kill], there is no negativity. However, if one beats orkills [illusory beings] while clinging to autonomous continua [of theirs], althoughthere certainly is no beating or killing of anybody at all, still, through the inten-tion of killing and the intention of beating, one produces negativities that comefrom hatred. [670] This is the case because it is equal to the statement that oneproduces negativity if one awakes while one is killing [someone] in a dream andthen rejoices [in this killing]. Therefore, the implication in [verse 11] “When illu-sory beings and such are killed . . . “ is that one knows that these are illusions.Concerning [lines 23cd] “Recollection comes from . . . ,” [VibhÒticandra]states:[The example of] the rat here [refers] to applying [remedial] arsenic [tothe rat bite]: The poison of the rat that has spread previously through-out the body through the wound of the bite will become active laterat the time when thunder resounds.

As it is said:The Sage did not stateThat seeing, hearing, and such are real or delusive.Because one side has an opposite side,These two do not exist ultimately.1527With respect to [verse 26], “If an illusion is not something other than mind, . . .”he asks:Is an illusion something other than mind, not something other, both,or neither—which of these four possibilities is it?1528He then [answers in the following vein]: [An illusion] is not something otherthan mind, because [the Mere Mentalists themselves] assert that it is establishedas mere mind. If it were something other, the illusion would be nonexistent,because they assert that there are no phenomena apart from mind. It is not both,since that is [internally] contradictory. So they might say, “It is neither.” [How-ever,] if one [possibility out of the two dichotomous possibilities of] being some-thing other or not being something other does not apply, then one cannot rejectthe other [possibility either, because there is no third option in a dichotomy].Therefore, it is impossible that [an illusion] is this fourth possibility [of beingneither].On [lines 27cd–29ab] “You might say, ‘Cyclic existence . . . ,’” he commentsas follows:If cyclic existence were mind, it follows that it would be what is puri-fied, since the mind is naturally luminous.

Therefore, when discursiveness is at peace like space, the welfare of allsentient beings will be simultaneously and uninterruptedly accomplished with-out any effort through the impetus of aspiration prayers and enlightened com-passion.Just as a wish-fulfilling jewel [795] grants those who pray [to it] all needs andwishes without thinking and[just as] all that one wishes—such as garments, jew-elry, food, and drink—comes forth from a wish-fulfilling tree,ready to bepicked, likewise, because of their aspiration prayers, the enlightened activity [ofBuddhas] will interact with the assembly of those to be trained. For the pure onesto be trained, it appears as the Body of Perfect Enjoyment that is like a wish-ful-filling jewel. Through this, the oceanlike needs and wishes in terms of the dharmaare granted. For those who are [only] slightly pure, it appears as a supreme Ema-nation Body that is like a wish-granting tree.

The Brief Answer in the ScripturesThe reason is that the scriptures declareThat there is no enlightenment without this path.

For those with the discriminating notion of “entities,” thisattainment of the three [types of] enlightenment is not the case andthere is no chance for it.The path of all the past and future Victors and of those who live in theten directions [at present]Is this perfection. [Everything] else is not [their path].It is not possible that the noble ones of the hearers reject the great vehicle[804], for the following reason: It is stated that it is not the case and that there isno chance that any arhat who hears this great vehicle will not have true confi-dence. Through this, it can be illustrated that [there is a tendency in this] direc-tion [of the great vehicle] all the way down even to stream-enterers. Also amongthose who have attained any of the twenty discriminating notions1555and whodedicatedly work on meditative stability, there are generally few who reject thegreat vehicle, because there is a majority of those who are dedicated to examin-ing the status of their own continua.However, once one has attained the actual state of the fourth meditative sta-bility and then attains the meditative absorption without discrimination in whichdiscriminations and feelings have ceased, one might [still] cling to the idea that“I have attained arhathood.” This is called “[an arhat] with the manifest pride ofbeing an arhat.” It is possible that one rejects the great vehicle through this [pride]for the following [two] reasons: Such is explained in The Jewel Casket SÒtra. Ingeneral, seers who possess the five supernatural knowledges can see five hundredformer lifetimes with the [kind of] supernatural knowledge that remembers for-mer states, [but] they do not see beyond this [time span]. Therefore, wrong philo-sophical systems of a fixed number of former and laterlives—such as [thinking],“Beyond that [time] I do not exist”—have originated.Thus, it is mainly hearers fond of dialectic who cling to any mere words fromthe three scriptural collections1556and become arrogant through presuming thatthis [clinging] is the self-confidence of awareness and release.1557They are wellknown and self-appointed as pa ̊ ̃itas and such. While not understanding theinconceivable dharma of the Buddha, they presume to apprehend and grasp thescope of the unlimited space of dharma with their own understanding that is likethe wingspan of a bee. They say that everything that is not in accordance with thisis not dharma and angrily denounce and reject it.This is the case because [of the following:] We find reports of this kind—suchas in The Great Cloud [SÒtra]1558and The Great Drum[SÒtra]—about [people]who were self-appointed hearers and rejected the great vehicle in India’s centralThe Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .663Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 663"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"provinces as well as in its east, west, and so forth.

The Proof That the Great Vehicle Is Buddha’s SpeechIf the great vehicle is not established,How are your scriptures established?“Because they are established for both [of us].”[However,] they were not established for you at first. [41]You should apply the conditions that made you believe in themIn the same way to the great vehicle too. [42ab]These six lines express the equal applicability [of the reason].Thus, those who have such a bad fate and are like evil spirits say, “A greatvehicle does not exist for the following reasons: (a) Those in the direct retinue ofour Teacher, such as ⁄›riputra, did not hear it. (b) If they had heard it, it wouldbe reasonable that it would have come to us hearers, but that did not happen. (c)It was stated that something is Buddha’s speech if it is contained in the sÒtra col-lection, appears in the vinaya, and does not contradict the true nature of phe-nomena. However, the great vehicle is not something like this, because it is notcontained in our sÒtra collection and so on.”Here, we ask in return: Ifit is not establishedthat the great vehicleis theBuddha’s speech, howis it establishedthat the scripturesof youhearers—thethree scriptural collections—are established?They might say, “[They are estab-lished,] because they arewell known and established for bothof us.” So do youbelieve that they are the Buddha’s speech since beginningless time, or did youcome to know them as the Buddha’s speech later by virtue of spiritual friends?The firstalternative does not apply, because it was not established for youthat664The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 664"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"the [scriptures of the hearers] are the Buddha’s speech when you were a newbornchild that was not grown up yet and when you were a lay person who was notengaged in any philosophical system and thus was ignorant even about the con-ventional term “Buddha’s speech.”If there are certainconditions,such as spiritual friends, [806] that made youbelieve in theTeacher being the Buddha, his teaching being the genuine dharma,and the guides being the spiritual community, you should equally applythese[conditions] to the great vehicle too.[This is just the same case,] because thebelief in the inconceivable Dharma Body and the Form [Bodies], the limitlessscriptural collections of the great vehicle, and the marvelous spiritual communityof bodhisattvas arises from the conditions that are the spiritual friends of thegreat vehicle and the profound and vast scriptural collections.It is also not the case that great hearers, such as ⁄›riputra, did not hear the[great vehicle], because their names are mentioned in the introductions to greatsÒtras of the great vehicle and [because] they and the great bodhisattvas ascer-tained the dharma through questions and answers. That imperfect hearers whoare not vessels for the great vehicle did not hear and experience it does not serveas a correct reason to prove that the great vehicle does not exist. One might as wellsay, “It is not possible that bees extract honey from a lotus, because if the lotushad honey, the insects and frogs that continuously hang on to the roots of thelotus must have tasted it, but they do not taste it.” What would be the difference[between this and your statement above]?The discourses that are included in the sÒtra collectionYou assert as the words of the Buddha.Does this not simply amount to assertingThat most of the great vehicle is equal to your sÒtras?

However, personally, I think that these[verses] do not entail any mistake whatsoever of being unrelated [to this text] forthe following reasons: The meaning of the great vehicle is inconceivable. [809]Thus, [⁄›ntideva] gives an answer [here] by establishing the great vehicle’s owntexts as a [source of] valid cognition [by saying], “How should you fathom some-thing whose depths Mah›k›Ÿyapa and others were not able to fathom before?” Ifthis [verse 51] did not represent the words of master [⁄›ntideva], [what remainsof this whole] Ÿloka1580would be very little, because then line [51e] “This wouldapply in the same way to the inferior vehicle too”1581would be empty of some-thing that is expressed [by it].Such [considerations] certainly do apply.

In this newly founded great traditionof rejecting the dharma in such a way, they exclaim, “We distinguish betweendharma and nondharma.” This seems to be a great abyss for those who wish forliberation.With respect to these [verses], Kaly› ̊adeva explains:668The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 668"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"[Line 41d] “[However,] they were not established for you at first”means: Without the great vehicle, one would not become enlightened,and without this [enlightenment], your scriptures are also not estab-lished.1582The Small Commentary on the Difficult Pointsformulates the thesis of the oppo-nent [in lines 40ab] as follows:One will be released through seeing what is real—the nature that actu-ally exists—but not through seeing that nothing whatsoever is estab-lished.The Small Commentary on the Difficult Points of the Knowledge Chaptersupple-ments the following words:As for [the words] “for both [of us]” [in line 41c]: The [scriptures ofthe hearers] are established for both the opponent and the proponent.[Line 41d] “[However,] they were not established for you at first”means that the [scriptures of the hearers] were not established [for youhearers] before you accepted them.1583The [master] from Sabsang appears to give the following explanation:You might say, “The inferior vehicle is the Buddha’s speech, since boththe persons of the great vehicle and those of the inferior vehicle assertit as the Buddha’s speech. However, the great vehicle is not the Bud-dha’s speech, because we hearers do not assert it as the Buddha’sspeech.” However, then also the inferior vehicle would not have beenestablished as the Buddha’s speech during the time when, first, nobodyelse believed in it. [810]The Blessed One Maitreya proves in The Ornament of SÒtras1584that the greatvehicle is the Buddha’s speech. [Here,] the way in which he does so shall be givenas an ancillary explanation.Those who reject the dharma are those who have inferior faculties by natureand are controlled by negative friends:They aspire to what is inferior, and their constitutions are also very much inferior.They are completely surrounded by inferior friends.The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .669Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 669"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"If to this dharma that excellently explains what is profound and vastThey do not aspire, it is established [as supreme].1585The way they reject [the great vehicle] is by saying, “Since there were a greatmany who attained arhathood by means of the vehicle of the hearers, thedemons1586taught the great vehicle in which one must stay in cyclic existence forthe welfare of others until cyclic existence is emptied. Therefore, everybodyentered this [vehicle] and those who attain arhathood have become less. Thus, ithas been taught as an obstacle to liberation.”Some also say, “This great vehicle was concocted by dialecticians in order tomock the teachings. [This is the case] because the texts of those dialecticians whoare the Mundanely Minded teach that nothing at all exists, and this [great vehi-cle] also teaches that—from form up through omniscience—nothing exists.[Moreover,] the definition of the Buddha’s speech is: ‘That which serves as theremedy for cyclic existence and teaches the unmistaken view.’ However, this[great vehicle] does not function as a remedy for cyclic existence, because itteaches that one has to remain in cyclic existence for a long time. [Also,] its viewis mistaken, because it teaches nonexistence. Therefore, it is not the Buddha’sspeech.”Here, [Maitreya] invalidates wrong conceptions through a sevenfold rea-soning:[The great vehicle is Buddha’s word,] for [the following] reasons: There was no prophecy before; it originated simultaneously;It is not an object; it is established;If it exists, it exists, and if it did not exist, [the inferior vehicle] would not exist either;It is a remedy; its terms are different.15871) It was not concocted by demons, because if this were the case, it would havebeen reasonable that the Buddha K›Ÿyapa,1588just as in his prophecies in relationto the dreams of [King] Krikri,1589had prophesied, “The so-called great vehiclethat was created by demons [811] will originate.” But he did not teach this.Some people think, “He did not prophesy this, since he did not know aboutit, or considered it to be of little purpose, or did not see it because it happenedat some future time.” This is not reasonable because of the following: [The Bud-dha] has direct vision of all knowable objects. Since there is nothing higher andsuperior to the teaching of the Buddha, it is not suitable for him to be indiffer-ent about the great essential points in it. [The Buddha] does not have obscura-tions of wisdom with respect to the past and the future.670The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 670"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"The Buddhas [have] direct vision,They also protect the teachings,And their wisdom is unobscured in terms of time too.Therefore, it does not make sense that [the Buddha] was indifferent.15902) Furthermore, [in general,] if something is an obstacle, then the obstructingphenomenon must happen after the prior occurence of the phenomenon that isobstructed. In contrast, the great vehicle and the inferior vehicle occured togetherat the same time. Thus, how could one set them up as something that obstructsand something that is obstructed? This [teaching of the inferior vehicle] wasgiven in order to avoid frightening the followers of the inferior vehicle and inorder to guide them. Correctly speaking, in this teaching [of the great vehicle],the inferior vehicle is nothing but the first discourse for the group of five [disci-ples].1591However, the great vehicle [itself] is limitless, [which is] also [illustratedby] the dharma collections that were taught before the first wheel [of dharma onearth], such as the teaching of “the one hundred eight gates that illuminate thedharma” that [the Buddha gave] when he was about to move from Tu ̋ita1592andthe proclamation of The SÒtra of Vast Arrays of Buddhas1593when he becameenlightened [in Akani ̋ ̨ha].3) [The great vehicle] was not concocted by dialecticians for the following rea-son: Since their dialectic depends on naïve beings and does not have any essence,it is something uncertain, does not encompass perfect actuality, and teaches theseeming.Dialectic is dependent and uncertain,Not encompassing, seeming, and involves weariness.It is asserted that it depends on naïve beings.Therefore, this [great vehicle] is not their object.1594Such profound and vast points [812] like these [in the great vehicle] are not thesphere of dialecticians.4) Some people claim, “Though [the great vehicle] is not an object of other dialec-ticians, the seer Kapila and others have become omniscient. Thus, it was createdby so-called special Buddhist dialecticians.” Or, some say, “It was taught by aBuddha other than the Blessed One.” However, then the great vehicle is estab-lished as Buddha’s speech. This is just the same as the Buddha speech of BuddhaK›Ÿyapa and the Buddha speech of Buddha ⁄›kyamuni being equal in that [both]are Buddhas’ speech. Not only is this definitely the case, but moreover, it isexplained even in the sÒtras of the inferior vehicle that a second teacher [who isThe Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .671Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 671"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"a Buddha] does not manifest in the single sphere [of one Buddha’s activity]. Inconsequence, these people claim something that is contradictory to the sÒtras,because they claim the Buddha speech of Buddha Kapila and [thus] that a Bud-dha other than our teacher has manifested in this sphere here during the presenttime [of our teacher].5) Again, does a great vehicle exist or does it not exist? If it exists, it is reasonablethat it is solely this [great vehicle under consideration], because if another [greatvehicle] than this one existed, it should be suitable to appear, whereas, in fact,another [great vehicle] is not observable. If [the great vehicle] did not exist, themeans for attaining Buddhahood would not exist [either]. If this were the case,also the inferior vehicle would not be Buddha’s speech, since Buddhahood is notpossible [given this absence of means for attaining it].Some might say, “This very vehicle of the hearers is the great vehicle.” Thisvehicle of the hearers is not the great vehicle—which is the means to accomplishBuddhahood—for the following reasons: (a) The ten perfections are not complete[in the vehicle of the hearers]. (b) It contradicts the path of great enlightenment,since it accomplishes only the minor welfare of oneself. (c) It is not the means forperfection, maturation, and purification.1595[It is] incomplete, contradictory,And not the means. Since it does not teach the like,This vehicle of the hearersIs not called the “dharma of the great vehicle.”1596Thus, this vehicle of the hearers and solitary realizers is inferior in its intention,which means that it intends the limited welfare of oneself. That it is inferior inits teaching [813] means that it teaches nothing but solely the means for libera-tion from cyclic existence. It is inferior in its training; that is, it is not conjoinedwith special means and knowledge. That it is inferior in its reliances means thatit relies only on small accumulations and personal identitylessness. It is also [infe-rior] in terms of time, since [its practitioners] wish for a quick limited nirv› ̊a,because they are not able to don the armor [of vigor] for the time of inconceiv-able eons. Since it is contradictory [to the great vehicle in these ways], it is calledthe “inferior vehicle.”In intention, teaching,Training, reliance,And time it is contradictory. What is inferior because of these [factors]Is just something inferior.1597672The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 672"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"6) Furthermore, [the great vehicle] is qualified by the three seals that indicateBuddha’s speech, for the following reasons: (a) It applies to its own sÒtra collec-tion, since it teaches the inconceivable actuality.

Hence, it is per-fect Buddha speech.Because it applies to its very own [sÒtras]And also appears in its own vinaya,Because it is profound, and because it is vast,There is no contradiction to the nature of phenomena.1598[The great vehicle] is the supreme of remedies because it releases numberless sen-tient beings from cyclic existence, to say nothing of vanquishing one’s own cyclicexistence. This is the case because it teaches the vast dharmas—seeming reality,the accumulation of merit, and the Form Bodies—in order to completely mature[beings] as well as the nonconceptual profound dharmas—ultimate reality, theaccumulation of wisdom, and the Dharma Body. Thus, this [teaching] is theunsurpassable great means.Because it is vast, because it is profound,And because it is completely maturing and nonconceptual,Both [dharmas] are taught in this one here.This is the unsurpassable means.15997) Also, such [expressions] as “nonexistence” are to be taught through words ofimplications and flexible implications as such terms that differ [from their super-ficial meanings]. Certainly, [814] these are not to be taken literally. It is explainedthat they were stated in the texts of profound view in order to eliminate super-imposition and denial and that they were stated in the texts of vast conduct withthe implication of the threefold lack of a nature. However, they are not to beclung to as exclusively this.[The great vehicle is the Buddha’s word,] because there are no others than this [and because] it is very profound and concomitant.It entails teaching the whole variety and teaching continuously through a multitude.Its meaning is not just literal and the implications of the Conqueror are very profound.If the learned ones examine properly, they will not be frightened by this dharma.1600The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .673Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 673"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"Therefore, if one listens to and hears the collection of the great vehicle with itsprofound and vast meanings, proper mental engagement in its meaning that isapproximately concordant with meditative concentration will arise.

To state, “This was declared for the sake of bod-hisattvas” and “This was declared for the sake of hearers” is to reject thedharma. To say, “This is a training for bodhisattvas” and “This is not[such] a training” means rejecting the dharma.[816] It is stated that also [the following factors] are included in rejecting thedharma: all attributions of mistakes (such as with respect to the conduct of pro-ponents of the dharma, their words, the meaning [of these], whether these arecontradictory or repetitive), all doubts, and all discriminating notions of reject-ing or adopting with respect to the Buddha’s speech. [A sÒtra] reports:During [the time of] the teachings that are renowned to come from theprevious Thus-Gone One “Radiating Immaculate Light,” the presentBuddha Amit›yus was a fully ordained monk called “Entirely PureConduct.” He adopted sixty thousand sÒtras of complete pulverizationand one hundred million sÒtra collections. Then he tamed an infinitenumber of individuals within the three vehicles through teaching inaccordance with their aspirations.

Through this,he was born in the hells for seventy eons and forgot the mind ofenlightenment for sixty eons. After that, although the Thus-Gone One“Completely Hidden Jewel Light” had caused him to generate themind [of enlightenment], he became an animal for ninety thousandlifetimes and a poor human being for sixty thousand [lifetimes]. How-ever, in all of these [rebirths,] he was [born] without a tongue.It is further stated that, even if someone who rejects the dharma will becomeenlightened, demons will appear, degenerated times will happen, and many obsta-cles to the teaching will too.The SÒtra That Teaches the Nonorigination of All Phenomena1609explains:During the teaching of the previous Buddha “King Truly Noble Likethe Highest Mountain,” there was the Thus-Gone One “UnshakableFully Ordained Monk with Completely Pure Conduct” together withhis retinue. He was not watching the sense faculties, consciousnesses,or observed objects; that is, he was endowed with conduct that is skill-ful in means. Our Teacher [Buddha ⁄›kyamuni] himself was a fullyordained monk called “Intelligent Insight of Conduct.” He hadattained the five supernatural knowledges, was endowed with ethicsand skilled in the vinaya, had qualities of purification, liked seclusion,and had a retinue that was just like him. [817] He disparaged the for-mer [Thus-Gone One by saying], “He has corrupted ethics,” and dep-recated his dharma too. Thus, after his transition from this lifetime, heexperienced unbearable sufferings in the lower realms and such, justlike the aforementioned one.Even MañjuŸrı reported the following [in a sÒtra]:In the Buddha-field “Great Illumination” of the former Thus-GoneOne “Lion’s Roar, King of Drum Sound,” the present Buddha“Immaculate Abundant Splendor Who Outshines Sun and Moon”was an upholder of the dharma called “Utterly Joyous Senses.” He wasendowed with the conduct of means of someone who does not thinkabout something to be adopted or to be discarded.

One day I enjoyedmy alms in the home of a lay man who was a disciple of the aboveupholder of the dharma and taught the dharma to the lay man’s sonwho had attained endurance. When I deprecated the dharma and thisperson by saying, “This former upholder of the dharma taughtwrongly,” the lay man’s son said, “Venerable One, how do You under-stand desire?” “I understand it as completely afflicted.” “Well, then, isdesire inside or is it outside?

This isthe case because the sÒtras state that for each and every one of these [virtues above]you will obtain far greater merits [through the vajra points] than through them.This is also established through reasoning because of the following: Throughgenerosity, one obtains nothing but mere wealth. Through ethics, nothing but abody in the higher states [is gained]. [823] Through meditation, one achievesnothing but the relinquishment of the afflictive obscurations, but this does notfunction as the direct remedy for all obscurations.

[However,] this expanse of dharmas is character-ized by nonconceptuality. Such realization of the nature of these phe-nomena is enlightenment. You should understand this by thinking, ‘Ifsomeone is instructed in the aforesaid manner and is not afraid, is notfrightened and will not be frightened, e ma, this is a bodhisattva whodoes not revert. This [bodhisattva] has the karmic disposition for theground of irreversibility.’ Thus, through these instructions, one shoulddevelop delight again and again.”At that point, eight fully ordained monks [whose minds] were refer-ential did not feel devotion for such [teachings] and went away fromthe retinue. They died upon vomiting fresh blood and were reborn inthe howling hell. MañjuŸrı said, “Alas, now look at all this harm thatyour dharma specification has inflicted on these fully ordained monks!”The Blessed One pronounced, “MañjuŸrı, do not talk like this. If theyhad not heard this dharma, they would not even be reborn in anypleasant realms for one million eons, let alone become enligthened. Itis precisely through hearing this dharma with their qualms that theybecome liberated from hell this very day and are reborn as gods inTu ̋ita. They will please ten billion Buddhas for sixty-eight eons andlive as miraculously born wheel-rulers1619throughout this time. There-after, they will become Buddhas who are [all] called ImmaculateLight.” During this prophecy, the sons of the gods arrived and said,“Blessed One, we rejoice in this specification of the dharma.” Theybecame nonreturners in this very moment.The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .683Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 683"},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"The SÒtra of the Abiding of MañjuŸrı1620says:It is without analysis, [825] without discursiveness, utter peace. Thereis no claim of any statements such as “It exists,” “It does not exist,” “Itboth exists and does not exist,” or “It does neither exist nor not exist.”Once these are not claimed, this is nonreferentiality. Since this is free-dom from all discursiveness, there is no mind and [there is] freedomfrom mind. It is called “abiding in the dharma of practicing positivityin the manner of nonabiding.”Through this teaching, four hundred fully ordained monks becamearhats. Another one hundred [fully ordained monks] were deeply dis-turbed and stayed behind. They fell into the howling hell.[This sÒtra] gives the following prophecy:If they had not heard this dharma, they definitely would have falleninto this hell [realm anyway], but through hearing this dharma, theycome into contact with the sufferings of this hell only for a singlemoment and are instantly reborn as gods in Tu ̋ita. [Later,] they willattain arhathood as the first followers of [the coming Buddha]Maitreya.Also The Dharmamudr› SÒtra1621states:[The Buddha] spoke, “Neither going beyond the phenomena of ordi-nary beings nor attaining uncontaminated phenomena—this is theordination in the excellently spoken dharma of the vinaya and thesupramundane completion of the vows.

The Proof through ReasoningThe root of the teaching is full monkhood,And this full monkhood is ill established.A nirv› ̊a of those whose minds are referentialIs ill established too. [44]This [verse] teaches that one does not attain [the state of] the ultimate fullyordained monk and nirv› ̊a if one does not realize emptiness.[826] If one does not rely on the great vehicle, one does not obtain the teach-ing of the Buddha completely. The reason for this is: It is certainly the case thatthe root of the teaching is full monkhood, and this full monkhood isvery illestablished.You might think, “What are you talking about? [It is said,] ‘There are five[types of] fully ordained monks [that are described] in the vinaya: the fullyordained monk who just bears this name, the pretending fully ordained monk,the fully ordained monk who just seeks [alms], and the fully ordained monk whohas vanquished the afflictions. [The fifth] is the one who has fully entered theorder.1622[This is accomplished] through the fourfold act of requesting1623[that isperformed] in this dharma [tradition]. [Here,] the intention is that he is the onewho is to be called “fully ordained monk.”‘ Thus, it is stated that the very onewho receives the vows through the ritual of fourfold [activity], such as request-ing, is the fully ordained monk. Therefore, [full monkhood] is well established.”Such an [explanation] is nothing but an approach to temporarily take care ofnaïve beings. This is the case because the [actual] intention [here] is that the per-fect fully ordained monk is the ultimate fully ordained monk. This is the [monk]who has vanquished the afflictions, and the only one who has completely van-quished the afflictions is the Buddha.Hence, a nirv› ̊a of those whose minds are referential is ill established toofor the following reasons. Many sÒtras—such as The SÒtra of the White Lotus ofGenuine Dharma—explain this in an extensive way:All the hearers did not pass into nirv› ̊a.By engaging in enlightening conduct,All these hearers will become Buddhas.1624The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .685Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 685"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"The vehicle is just one, there are no two.I taught two vehicles for the sake of [some needing to] take a rest.Therefore, you fully ordained monks,I do not pass into nirv› ̊a today for just that much.For the sake of omniscient wisdom,You should generate extensive and genuine vigor.1625 Noble ⁄›riputra spoke [in this sÒtra]:Before, I was attached to views,A wandering mendicant1626honored by the forders.Then, the Protector knew my thoughtsAnd spoke about nirv› ̊a in order that I be freed from views.Having been freed from all that is a view, [827]I attained the dharma of emptiness.Therefore, I think, “I passed into nirv› ̊a.”Yet this is not what is called “nirv› ̊a.”When one has become a Buddha, the principal of sentient beings,Honored by gods, humans, harmbringers, and evil ghosts,And possesses the body with the thirty-two marks,Then this is complete nirv› ̊a.1627The Blessed One Maitreya[‘s Sublime Continuum] explains:Thus, without the attainment of Buddhahood,Nirv› ̊a is not attained,Just as one is not able to watch the sunSeparated from its light and rays.1628[The Buddha] has declared that one does not transcend being referential ifone does not realize emptiness and that there is no way that someone who is ref-erential could attain endurance.1629As he said this, how could it be possible thatsomeone attains enlightenment who has not even attained endurance?If liberation came from relinquishment of the afflictions,It should happen immediately after this.However, one sees the efficacy of actions686The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 686"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"Even in those who lack afflictions. [45]You might argue, “Here it has been determinedThat they do not have any craving that appropriates.”Why should they not also have unafflicted craving,Just as they have basic ignorance? [46]Craving comes from the condition of feelings,And they do have feelings. [47ab]These two and a half verses teach that even arhats are not released from karma.You might say, “Even without the realization of emptiness, ifone is liberatedfrom the afflictions, this in itself is enlightenment.” Then it wouldfollow thatthe [state that is attained] immediately after thisliberation from the afflictionsis perfect relinquishment.However, you cannot assert this, because it is explainedthat many results that are induced by former actions [exist]even in those whoare asserted to be arhats of the inferior vehicle andlackmanifest afflictions. [Thiscan be seen from] such cases as Maudgaly›yana’s limbs being smashed by wan-dering ascetics, Ud›yin being beheaded by a robber chief, Little Kubja [dyingfrom] eating mud soup at the end of being ill for seven days, and Upasena beingcaught by poisonous snakes.[Also the effects of] latent tendencies of afflictions are explained here, such asin the case of the arhat Kapıtana ̄ who destroyed the reliquary of [a person called]Thursday out of his latent tendencies of hatred. There were also some [arhats]who yelled, “Ain’t they gorgeous!” at women and got all excited while guffawingwith laughter. Or, we have such [reports] as the one about the two sons offinanda’s sister [828] who were fooling around with their miraculous powers afterthey had attained novitiate and arhathood at the age of seven: On their way tofetch water, they would send the pot ahead in space while they followed behind.Furthermore, there was Gav›mpati, who, due to his latent tendencies of affection,cried out, “Brother PÒr ̊a!”1630Thus, one seesthat they possess thelatent ten-denciesof actions.You might argue, “This is certainly true. However, here, it has been deter-mined that they do not have any craving that appropriatesfurther existences.”Agreed, those who are asserted to be hearer arhats surely do not have afflictedignorance. However, since they do have unafflicted ignorance, their wisdom can-not engage in all knowable objects. Hence, they do not have this afflicted crav-ing, but why should they not have unafflicted craving, just asthey haveunafflicted basic ignorance?[They indeed have unafflicted craving], because onesees them looking for food, taking medicine, and so on.

However, they do have[the kind of] grasping and birth that is the transformation in the form of incon-ceivable death and transition that is based on imprints through subtle latent ten-dencies. This is the ground of latent tendencies of basic unawareness.Therefore, The SÒtra of [the Lion’s Roar of Queen]⁄rım›l›and others declarethat [arhats] do not attain the perfection of ultimate purity—the relinquishmentof the ground of latent tendencies of basic unawareness—nor the [perfection] ofultimate permanence—the relinquishment of inconceivable death and transi-tion. [829]Referential mindsBecome stuck here and there. [47cd]Without emptiness, a fettered mindWill arise again,Just as in the case of the meditative absorption withoutdiscrimination. [48a–c]These five lines teach that the stream of births will not be interrupted if one doesnot realize emptiness.Of course, there are cases of mindsthat referto some objects and thusbecomestucksomewhere, that is, in some meditative concentrations, for many eons.However, such is not essential at all. Without the realization of true emptiness,a mindthat is fettered[in this way] at one timewill arise againdue to other con-ditions [at a later time], just as in the case of the meditative absorptionof some-one without discrimination.One’s mind stream is interrupted [in this meditativeabsorption] for [long periods], such as eighty-four thousand great eons, but oneawakens again [from it] and is reborn in another place in cyclic existence.2.2.3. The Summary of the Function of Both of These [Types of Seeing]Thus, you should meditate on emptiness.

[52]These five lines explain the result of having meditated on emptiness.Thus,no one at all is observable who is a meditator (a self or a person) andnothing whatsoever is visible that is to be meditated upon (any such aspect as con-ditioned or unconditioned, permanent or impermanent, real or delusive). Hence,no discrimination whatsoever is adopted or discarded, and nothing is observedin any way of meditating whatsoever. Even the apprehension of observation ornonobservation does not exist before immaculate knowledge. In consequence, noone abides at any point in anything whatsoever, and also this is not seen as anaspect of anything. This [nonseeing] means seeing perfect actuality and knowingthat there is nobody who meditates on anything in any way whatsoever. Thus,not being stirred from just this is called “to meditate on emptiness.” A sÒtra says:Through this, once mind and observed object are perfectly and mostdirectly not seen, this is seeing what is perfect.The SÒtra of the King of Meditative Concentrationsays:One finds that phenomena are unfindable,But also in [this] finding there is no finding.Those who know phenomena in this wayWill realize ultimate enlightenment.Space is explained to be ungraspable.You do not find anything to grasp in it.The nature of phenomena is precisely this—Ungraspable, just as space.In this way, the dharma is taught: [830]There is nothing whatsoever in it to be seen.Inconceivable is this dharmaOf those who do not see this dharma.The SÒtra of [the Meditative Concentration of] the Collection of All Merits1631says:If these phenomena are unobservable,The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .689Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 689"},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"The unskilled ones who observe [them]Do not release themselves from sufferingAnd their sufferings will increase.You might ask, “What does it mean to see phenomena just as theyare?” This is what it is: just nonseeing.These and other [quotations] explain this extensively.To abide in this emptiness is supreme love, the supreme of all perfections,[supreme] complete upholding of the genuine dharma, and supreme pure ethics.The SÒtra [Requested by the King of the Kinnaras, Called] “Tree,”1632says:“Sound of Music” [asked]:“How come you embrace beings with love,When you have realized identitylessness?Identitylessness and love,How could they be the same?”The emanated bodhisattvas who dwelled on lotus flowers on the tipsof light rays answered:Those who fully know emptinessHave internalized identitylessness.Those who know that beings are emptyAre supreme in their love.The [SÒtra Requested by] Sky Treasureapplies this to all six [perfections], such as:Not apprehending any phenomenon is supreme giving.The SÒtra of the King of Meditative Concentrationsays:Those who delight in peaceful emptinessAre those who have grasped this dharma of the Victor.Those who have grasped this meditative concentrationHave taken ordination in my teachingAnd are the fully ordained monks with complete vows who perform theactivities of restoration and purification.1633This is also explained in many other places in the oceanlike collection of sÒtras.690The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 690"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"Therefore, in a manner of not meditating on anything at all, you should med-itate onprecisely just this perfect actuality that is beyond all observation.You might ask, “What kind of result comes from meditating on this?” [831] Allaspects of discrimination and observation as such and such are reversed. Thus,one knows that there is no phenomenon whatsoever to be attained through any-thing. This extinguishes [all] hopes for nirv› ̊a. Just like knowing that a dreamis a dream, one knows that suffering is not observable through its nature. Hence,there is no fear of cyclic existence. Apart from all phenomena just being mereimputations, they neither abide as any nature whatsoever nor do they abide asanything at all. Just this is what is seen as the very expanse of mind that is emptyand luminous. This puts you in a position where you have complete power overeverything you could possibly wish for, just as if all phenomena were resting inthe palm of your hand.Thus, by gaining power over and becoming very skilled in the dependent orig-ination of the collections of causes for the entirety of cyclic existence and nirv› ̊a,compassion for the assembly of sentient beings who do not realize this in thesame way wells up unbearably. [However,] at this point, there is nothing to beobserved as either oneself or sentient beings. To the same extent that great com-passion increases, also this very [realization] that, primordially, nothing can beobserved as sentient beings, what is not sentient beings, suffering, happiness, andso on grows and increases. This is the ultimate seeing that is like the orb of thesun. When it becomes stable and increases in such a way, great compassion—which is like the light rays of the sun—will grow even more than before. [Beingswith such realization] do not behold sentient beings, but great compassion stillflowers in them. They do not behold themselves either, but they still lend theirsupport to all sentient beings. They do not behold anything to be attained what-soever, but they still establish beings in great enlightenment. Just as there is noplace whatsoever to go to beyond space, they do not behold anybody who wouldgo somewhere beyond, but they still display [the activity of] liberating sentientbeings from cyclic existence.Thus, who would be able to realize the way of conduct of those who possessdemeanors that [seem to be] contradictory to the world? Therefore, [832] whatis the point of draining ourselves—who are just flies buzzing around—by [try-ing to] gauge the scope of these skylike bodhisattvas with our wingspan?

[In lines 52cd,] you proclaim:And will manage to remain in cyclic existence.This is the result of emptiness.If this is the case, then this is something through which one does not attain lib-eration from cyclic existence.”In general, solely through one’s understanding cyclic existence and nirv› ̊a asemptiness, the chains of both existence and peace will uncoil by themselves.There is no question that precisely this is a liberation that cannot be rivaled evenby one hundred thousand liberations of hearers and solitary realizers. However,one still abides in cyclic existence for the sake of others through compassion, justas a skilled physician does not abandon the assembly of the diseased. [Such abid-ing] is nothing other than [abiding] like a lotus that is unstained by mud. Hence,[a person who abides] in such a way is not called “someone in cyclic existence,”just as a physician is not called a “sick person.”This much is certainly true, but, moreover, only emptiness is thedirect rem-edy for thethick inner darknessthat obscures true reality, that is, the collectionof afflictive and cognitive obscurations.Because one has engaged in emptinessthrough devoted interest on [the paths of] accumulation and junction, empti-ness—which is, like space, without any difference—is realized on the path ofseeing in a manner of being omnipresent. Through the power of eliminatingadventitious stains on the paths of meditation, every aspect of the qualities intrin-sic to emptiness is revealed.

Teaching That a [Personal] Identity in General Is Not EstablishedIf there were something called “I,”It might be afraid of things here and there.However, since there is no “I” at all,Who is it who could be afraid? [56]This first verse teaches that there is no self that is the one who is afraid.[839] It has been taught [in verse 55] that emptiness is not something to beafraid of:However, emptiness is what relieves suffering,So why should it provoke any fear?This is definitely the case. On the other hand, if there were something called “I”that is the one who is afraid,it would of course be reasonable thatit might beafraid of things here and there that one can be afraid of. However, since thereis no “I” at all—not even a tiny one—it is not reasonable to be afraid. So first,[840] examine the one who could be afraid.I am not the teeth, hair, or nails,Nor bones or blood.I am neither nasal mucus nor phlegm,Nor lymph or pus.

[59][The first eleven lines of] these verses teach that the body is not the self, and thelast line teaches that the mind is not the self either.You might state, “The body is the self.” There is no body other than the col-lection of its parts. However, the parts are not the self, nor is there any self withinthem. Thus, I am not teeth, hair, or nails, as these are [just] bones and hairs. Itis not reasonable that I amsuch [things] as bonesor body hairs. Likewise, I amnot bloodand blood is not me either.I am neither nasal mucus nor phlegm, norlymph or pus.This is the case because these [substances] are filthy and it is notreasonable that the self is something filthy, nor is it reasonable that somethingfilthy is the self.I am not marrow nor sweat, as these two [substances] are nothing but thewater element [in] the interior [of the body].I am not fat, entrails, or any of theother inner organs, because they are nothing but flesh.I am also not excrementor urine, because these two [substances] are the waste products of food and drink.I am not flesh or sinew, nor bones, blood vessels, nerves, or tendons.The rea-sons are as follows: [Everybody can] see that flesh and so forth that are scatteredon a charnel ground are not the self, nor are they what belong to this self at all.Furthermore, one [can]not see a difference between the [flesh and such on acharnel ground] and the flesh and so forth of this [living] body. [Thus,] these[nine lines of verse] teach that the [inner] earth element and water element arenot the self.In the same way, I am not the body’s warmth(the fire element) orrespira-tion1642(the factor of the breath that involves inhalation, exhalation, and pause).These are just like fire in a stove and the wind that kindles it, which are not theself. Nor am I its various other inner orifices, such as the ones in the nose. Theyare just like outer windows, which are not the self.Now you might continue, “Granted, the body is surely not the self, but themind is the self.” I am not these six consciousnessesthat engage in objects, suchas the eye [consciousness], in any way either.The reasons are as follows: These[consciousnesses] arise in dependence on objects, such as form, [841] whereas it isnot reasonable that the self depends on conditions. Also, they are referred to as698The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 698"},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"“mine” by such discriminating notions as “my eye consciousness.” If they were theself, it would be contradictory [to say] that they are mine, because this is as impos-sible as something being both me and my horse. There is also no mind that is otherthan the six collections [of consciousness], because consciousness is just one sin-gle collection of consciousness and it is just this [single collection of consciousness]that is presented as sixfold due to [its apprehension of six kinds of] objects.Then you might try, “The ground consciousness is the self.” [However,] thisis taught nowhere other than in the context of the great vehicle. [For example,The SÒtra That Unravels the Intentionsays]:The appropriating consciousness is profound and subtle.All seeds flow into it like a river.It is not appropriate to conceive of it as a self.Hence, I did not teach it to naïve beings.1643Even when one [tries to] present the ground consciousness [as the self], this isnot the self either, because it is also referred to by the discriminating notion“mine.” In general, [the Buddha] proclaimed the ground [consciousness] with anintention, which was to reverse the view of causelessness. However, the [groundconsciousness] is not something that exists by its nature for the following reasons:It is not present on the Buddha ground. [The Buddha’s] main teaching is thedharma wheel in which, on the final level, the ground [consciousness] does notexist. There, he said:Those who assert the ground [consciousness] do not assert the dharma.If there were a self other than body and mind, it would be reasonable that itappears to oneself, because it is impossible for it to be a phenomenon that is hid-den from oneself. [However,] such [a self] does not appear. Thus, whether it ison the seeming level or the ultimate level, and whether it is under analysis or[just] conventionally, a self is never possible.3.1.2. The Particular Refutation of the Enumerators’ AssertionThe Enumerators state the following: The self is [mere] consciousness. [The self’s]own nature is [called] “the individual”1644which is endowed with this [mere con-sciousness]. Due to [the individual’s] desire, the equilibrium of the triad of “motil-ity,” “darkness,” and “lightness”1645—that is, the permanent “nature”1646— becomesimbalanced. This is what is called universal flux1647[or “manifestation”], whichinvolves arising and ceasing. [842] [In this process, first,] “the great one,” or “cog-nition,”1648[splits off] from its [original] unity with this permanent [“nature”].The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .699Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 699"},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"From [“cognition” manifests] “identification,”1649and thence the five “essentialelements,”1650such as the one of sound. These become shifted toward “cognition,”which is like a two-sided mirror. Thus, they appear for and are experienced by theself like reflections [in a mirror]. Apprehending [these objects] through “cognition”is what is sensed by “the individual.” Hence, the self is something that permanentlyhas the nature of consciousness, such as [the consciousness] of sound.1651The refutation of this is as follows:If [the self] were the consciousness of sound,It would perceive sound all the time.Excuse me—without a knowable object, what is it aware of?So why do you even speak about “consciousness”? [60]You might venture, “It is consciousness without somethingknowable.”Then it would follow that even a piece of wood is consciousness.It is definite that there is no consciousnessWithout a knowable object being close by. [61]These two verses refute permanent perception of sound.If, according to you, [this permanent self] were the consciousness of sound,then it follows that sound resounds uninterruptedly, since this consciousnesswould perceive sound all the time. Therefore, the sound of conch shells and thesound of lutes wouldbe uninterrupted and [would occur] independent of anyeffort, such as blowing these conch shells or playing the lutes. You might say,“Sometimes sound does not occur, since the object sound is not close by.” Excuseme—if there is no knowable object, since sound is not close by, what isthis con-sciousness aware ofat this time? Sotell us—why do you even speak about “con-sciousnessof sound”?You might venture, “It is consciousnessof sound even when it is withoutthe knowableobject sound.” Then it would follow that even a piece of wood isconsciousness, because [consciousness] does not need to be conscious of anobject.It is definite that there is noarising of consciousness without a know-able object being close by.Therefore, do not prattle about a consciousness thatperceives sound even when there is no sound.You might continue, “Exactly this is what is conscious of form.”Then why would it not also hear at that time?You might say, “Because no sound is close by.”In that case, there is also no consciousness of it.

Furthermore, thefollowing [consequence] will fall on you: You would have to hear the sound of aconch shell when you see a white conch shell, because a white conch shell is thesupport for the sound of this conch shell and [because, according to you,] thispermanent consciousness sees the form of the conch shell close by, while at thesame time there is no difference between the sound of this conch shell and theform of this conch shell in that the [first of these two] objects is close by and [theother] is far away. You might say, “There is no sound, because noobject soundis close by.” In that case, there is also no consciousness of thissound. If thereis no horn of a rabbit, [843] where should there be a consciousness of it? This isjust the same. If you agree here [by saying], “This is how it is,” then [your] the-sis of a permanent consciousness of sound has just collapsed.So, again we have to ask you: How should this work? How is it that this con-sciousness whose nature it is to perceive sound could perceive form?You mightsay, “This is just like a single person who may be presented as a son in depend-ence on [his] father and as a father in dependence on [his] son.”One single person may be conceived as both father and son,But this is not how it really is. [63cd]Thus, lightness, motility, and darknessAre neither father nor son.One does not see their natureIn connection with the perception of sound. [64]These one and a half verses refute the example of dependence that is given [bythe opponent].One single person maysometimes be conceived as father andsometimes asson. These are [just] conceptions in dependence [on other persons], but his [beinga father or a son] is not how it really is, since [such a person] is neither father norson when not considered in dependence [on his child or parents respectively].Thus, lightness(pleasure), motility(suffering), and darkness(dullness) that youThe Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .701Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 701"},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"assert are neither father nor son, because they do not depend on anything what-soever.1652You might disagree, “They depend on manifestations.” However, at thetime of not being dependent [on these manifestations], nobody sees the natureofmotility, darkness, and lightnessin connection with the perception of sound.1653“Just like an actor, this same entity assumes different forms.”However, then it is something impermanent.You might continue, “The same entity has different natures.”Such a singularity is something unprecedented indeed. [65]You might say, “Its different forms are not real.”Then just describe its own form!Your answer is, “It is just consciousness.”In that case, it would follow that all beings are one. [66]Also, the cognizant and the incognizant would be one,Because both are equal in just being existent.Now, when the particulars are mistaken,What would be their common ground? [67]These verses refute that [the self] is real as something permanent and single.You might say now, “Just like an actortakes on different forms—such asArjuna or Bhıma1654—in every moment, this sameconsciousness assumes dif-ferent aspects in different forms.” However, then it is certain that thiscon-sciousness is something impermanent, because it changes moment by moment.You might continue, “The actor takes on various different natures, but the actoris the same.Likewise, though it assumes different aspects, this self that entails apermanent consciousness that perceives sound is just a single one. Hence, thereis no mistake.” Well, we can only rebuke you: If [the self] is supposed to be boththesingularityof a self that entails this permanent consciousness that perceivessound and at the same time changes into all kinds of things—such as perceptionof form and perception of smell—then such a [self]is something unprecedentedin the world and impossible indeed.Furthermore, if the self is permanent as the consciousness of the essential ele-ment sound, it has to be permanent as the consciousness of all five essential ele-ments, such as the essential element form. [844] If that is the case, all five[essential elements], such as form, would have to be perceived permanently, evenif there are no objects or sense faculties.1655And if this is so, what [kind of] jobshould the self of blind and deaf people or the self at the time of sleeping andfainting be doing?702The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 702"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"You might say, “Since the permanent single self is not realas these differentforms, they do not contradict its being permanent and single.” Well, then, justdescribewhat the self’sown form is!Your answer is, “It is justmere conscious-ness.” In that case, it would follow that all beings are one, because they are notdifferent in being this one self that is mere consciousness. It would alsofollowthat the cognizant individual and the incognizant primal substance1656are one,because they are this one self. Then you might agree, “We accept that the natureand the individual are the same, since both are equal in just being existent.”Now, when thespecific particularsthat were presented by you—the individualwho has a mind and the nature that does not have a mind—are mistaken, whatwould be the groundor the basis of attribution that these two distinct features—with mind and without mind—have in commonor in which they are includedas being one?There is no basis whatsoever of these two that is other than thesetwo. They are also not one and the same, because these two are not mutuallyincluded in each other.[Synopsis of Other Commentaries]With respect to these verses, Kaly› ̊adeva states the opponents’ theses and refutesthem:The assertions by V›tsa ̄ and others that a so-called self, soul, or per-son exists are invalidated. The Enumerators label consciousness as the“self.” . . .1657He refutes [objections]:You might say, “Since sound and so on does not always remain in acertain place, it is not heard all the time.” Therefore, [lines 60cd] aregiven, “Excuse me—if there is no knowable object, what is it aware of?Why do you then say ‘consciousness’?”1658He comments further:[Verses 62–63ab:] If perception of form and perception of sound wereone, [845] to label the sense faculties as five would also be meaningless.[Verses 63cd–64:] If the nature is a permanent singularity, it is not jus-tified that, gradually—just as a son comes from a father—the “indi-vidual” arises from the “nature,” “cognition” from the [nature],“identification” from [cognition], the “essential elements” from [iden-The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .703Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 703"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"tification], and so forth. . . . You might object, “Although it is a sin-gularity, it is suitable to be labeled as many [things], just as a singlebeing may be called both father and son.” Since [its constituents], suchas lightness, are taught as something single, they are [just] labeled asmere “manifestations.” However, this “universal flux” is not some-thing that has arisen from the [constituents]. Hence, truly, lightnessand so on are neither father nor son.[Verses 65–67:] You might say, “Just like an actor, this very con-sciousness of sound is what appears [now] as the consciousness ofform.” If this were the case, just like the actor, this consciousness wouldbe impermanent. You might argue, “It is this very [consciousness] that[just] has another nature.” This very same [consciousness of sound]does not exist up to this present point, because this very same [earlierconsciousness of sound] is mutually contradictory to the other [con-sciousness of form that exists now]. Thus, it is refuted that [these two]are one. Then you might agree, “Granted, it is wrong that it is [thesame consciousness] that [just] has another nature. It does not exist inthis way.” If this is the case, then state how the very nature or entityof this self is. “It is just consciousness.” Then this entails the mistakethat it would follow that all beings are one; that is, beings who arereleased or not released [from cyclic existence] would be completelyidentical. Furthermore, it follows that the individual who has a mindand the nature that does not have a mind are one and the same. [Here,you] Enumerators say, “We accept that the individual and the natureare the same, since they are equal and identical in being existent.” TheCentrists answer with [lines 67cd], “Now, when . . .” This means thatthere is no particular difference between the individual and the naturein that they have mind or not and that they are both free from pro-gressive or nonprogressive activity. Hence, if, just like the horns of arabbit, [846] they are utterly nonexistent, then what is their conditionof likeness? There is none at all. Therefore, they are also not the same.These [verses] also eliminate [the notion of] generalities, such as cause,[that are something separate from their instances] and [the notion of]sharing the same status.1659[As for verse 56,] VibhÒticandra gives a quotation:When one analyzes this so-called self, there is nothing but words orconceptions. At this point, who is it who has fear?704The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 704"},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"Now, a self will not come forth anymore.Also “mine” will now not show up again.Naïve beings are afraid of it.In the learned ones, fear is exhausted.1660He comments further on [verses 65–67]:The example of the actor is not justified, because it does not accordwith the probandum to abandon [this actor’s] first mode of being andthen to seize another mode of [his] being. If you state that the actor isthe very same but is still of a different nature, then such a singularityis something unprecedented indeed. Since something other is differ-ent from the very same, [this example] is extremely contradictory. Youmight argue, “[There] is the very consciousness and perceptions ofform and such. [The latter] are [its] second modes of being. The modesof being of perceptions of form and such depend on objects like thecolor of a crystal. Hence, they are not real.” So what is the mode ofbeing of their nature? “It is just consciousness.” All right, you haveasserted that the two different consciousnesses that are the perceptionof sound and the perception of form are one. According to [this asser-tion], it follows that all beings are one, because they do not differ withrespect to consciousness. Moreover, if you discard distinctions andtake [things] to be one due to just some arbitrary [common] mode ofbeing, then mind (the phenomenon that is the “individual”) and whatis not mind (such phenomena as the “nature”) would not be different,because both are equal in being existent. [Here,] you might agree, “Iaccept.” [However,] at this point when particular entities are wrong,what would be their common ground? If there are many different sim-ilar entities, they are taken to be one through their similarity. However,such do not exist [here].1661[As for line 57d,] The Small Commentary on the Knowledge Chapterexplains:Lymph [847] is the rotten liquid that comes from scratching when oneitches. Fat is a rotten liquid that remains inside.1662This is not the case: Lymph is the very transparent fluid that arises from flesh andblood. Fat is the condensed grease of the body. It is such things as blood that turninto pus when they rot.[Then, this commentary] supplements some words for [line 65d], “Such a sin-gularity is something unprecedented indeed” to the effect that it is contradictoryThe Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .705Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 705"},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"for the self to be both single and of another nature. Therefore, it is indeed some-thing amazing that is unprecedented.1663There follow some supplementary words [for verses 66–67]:If the nature of the self were consciousness, it would follow that allbeings are one, since there would be no difference [in them] as far asmere consciousness is concerned. Also, it would follow that mind andwhat has no mind—the “individual” and the “nature”—are the same.Why? They are equal in “just being existent,” that is, in merely hav-ing a state of being, because they are not different [in this respect].Furthermore, if the distinctions that consist of the perception of formand such are mistakenly stated, since they are not real, then therewould be no common ground [for them]. The reason is that, if thereare no distinctions—as in the similarity of an ox and a gavaya ̄1664—to be identified, then there is no [common ground of such distinc-tions either]. [It would moreover follow that] multicolored and paleyellow [oxen] do not possess a difference, because they are the veryobjects that are expressed by the term “ox.”1665The Great Commentary [on lines 63cd–64ab and 67cd] is paraphrased hereaccording to its meaning:Someone may be presented as father and son in mutual dependence,but when he is [considered] independently, he is neither father norson. The Enumerators themselves assert that the equilibrium of thethree constituents is the permanent “primal substance” which is notfluctuating and that their disequilibrium turns into the impermanent“universal flux.” However, this is just a presentation in dependenceon temporary “manifestation,” whereas ultimately it comes down tothe assertion that there is no difference between earlier and later andthat the “nature” is [just] a single one.1666You might say, “The particulars of consciousness—the ‘manifesta-tions’ of the five ‘essential elements’ (such as the perception of form)—appear in a mistaken way. Therefore, they do not exist.” What then istheir common ground in terms of being mere consciousness? [Thereis none,] because they are not established.1667[848]In brief, Kaly› ̊adeva asserts that this phrase [in line 67b], “Because both areequal in just being existent” represents the answer of the Enumerators who say,“The nature and the individual are one, because they are equal in being exis-706The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 706"},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"tent.” The other [commentator]s assert that [this phrase] refers to our own [Cen-trist] statement, “It follows that ‘the individual’ and ‘the nature’ are one, becausethey are equal in being existent.”3.1.3. The Refutation of the LogiciansSomething incognizant is also not the selfFor the very reason that it has no mind, just like a garment and such.However, if it is consciousness, because it possesses mind,It follows that its incognizance is invalidated. [68]You might think, “In fact, the self is unchanged.”In what way then should mind have affected it?Thus, if it is incognizant and free from activity,This amounts to referring to space as the self. [69]The first verse refutes a self without mind, and the following verse refutes theassertion that such a self is unchanging.You Logicians say, “If one claims the self to be something that has mind, thesemistakes [above] certainly do apply, but we claim that it is something withoutmind.” Something incognizant is also not the self for the very reason that it hasno mind,for example, just like a garmentor cloth and such.You might venture,“Granted, the self is without mind, but since it meets with a distinct quality,called consciousness, it becomes cognizant.” However, if it isthe case that the selfturns into consciousness, because it possesses mind, it follows thatyour formerclaim of its incognizance is invalidated.Since you asserted before that it does notpossess mind and asserted later that it does so, this is also contradictory to yourassertion that the self is permanent.You might think, “In fact, this permanent self is unchanged.” With what[kind of] means for the arising of consciousness shouldthis feature of con-sciousness or mind have affected—or ever affect—the self?[This is impossible,]because something permanent is incapable [of functioning] as any kind of agentor object whatsoever.1668Thus, ifyou label something incognizant and free fromagent and object as the self, this amounts to labelingspace as the self.Hence,from now on, take space as your self!3.1.4. Teaching That Karma Is Not Contradictory to IdentitylessnessYou might say, “If there is no self,The connection between actions and their results is not possible.The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .707Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 707"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"As actions disappear, once they have been committed,Who would experience their results?” [70]This verse formulates the objection.Thus, it is taught that neither an innate nor an imaginary self exists.

Asthere is no self that is an agent and the actions themselves disappear, once theyhave been committedand completed,[849] who would experience their resultslater? In whom would their results mature?”Since it is established for both of usThat action and result have different basesAnd that a self does not have any function in this,Is your objection here not quite pointless? [71]This verse teaches that the positions of both disputants are equal in that there isno self as an agent.You asserted a permanent self that does not act, and now also we Buddhistsassert that there is no self. Hence, both ourparties accept the following: Theaction—that is, [committing] some deed (the time of the cause)—andits com-pletion (the time of theresult) have different basesor supports, and they entailan earlier and a later time. At both of these times, a self does not have any func-tionat all. Sincewe equally [accept] this, and, in consequence, your objectionherejust works against yourself, isit not quite pointless?One never sees it happenThat the provider of a cause is the recipient of its result.It is just in dependence on a single continuumThat a so-called agent and experiencer are taught. [72]This verse teaches that it is impossible for a cause and [its] result to be simulta-neous.Based on just a single phenomenon, one never sees it happen in the worldthatthe provider of a cause issimultaneously the recipient of its result.This is justlike the following example: As long as a lotus seed has not perished, it is impos-sible that its sprout nevertheless would grow, or that its flower would open with-out the sprout having ceased, or that its fruit would ripen while the flower leavesdo not wither.708The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 708"},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"You might argue, “Your own teacher has stated that the agent of actions expe-riences the result.” He taughtthe following: There is no self in a river at all, andits earlier [moments] are different from its later ones.

[Rather,] itis just in dependence on a singlemental continuum that[its] earlier [moments]are called “agent”at the time of committing an action and[its] later [momentsare called] “experiencer”at the time of experiencing the result. Thus, there is noself that is an agent, and it has been refuted that [such a self] is this very mind thatrepresents the agent.

The Ancillary Refutation of the Analyzers and of the [Specific Kind of] Person [That Is Asserted by] the Followers of V›tsıputra in Our Own FactionThe past and the future mindAre not the self, because they do not exist.You might say, “Well, then the just-arisen mind is the self,”But when it has ceased, there is no self anymore. [73]The first half of this verse teaches that the past and the future [mind] are not theself, while the second half [teaches] that the present [mind] is not the self [either].At this point, you Analyzers and others say, “Just this mind stream is the self.”This is also not the case: The mind is something that entails the aspect of a stream.The past and the future mind are not the self, because thatwhich is past doesnot exist after it has ceased (just as yesterday’s offering lamp) and because thatwhich is in the future does not existnow, since it did not arise yet (just as tomor-row’s rainbow does not exist now). [850] You might say, “Well, then the mindthat has just arisenand not yet ceased is the self,” but even this [present mind]is something that entails extremely infinitesimal fractions of the three times. If youanalyze precisely, you are not able to observe what is present. Even if you considerit roughly, whenyou grasp [at the present moment of mind] as the self, what youhave grasped at hasalready ceased[in the next moment]. Hence, in this way,there is nothing in the present [moment of mind] that is a self.For example, there is nothingIf you take the trunk of a banana tree apart.Likewise, if you search for it with thorough analysis,The self is not really true either.

Sincecyclic existence is produced through the intense clinging to these four, this set offour—body, feelings, mind, and phenomena—constitute the objects to focus on.2) The nature [of the applications of mindfulness] is the knowledge that under-stands the nature of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena. To understand thatthe body is impure is the nature of the application of mindfulness of the body,because this is the knowledge that understands how its nature in dependence onthe seeming level is. [The same applies for] the remaining [three]. The Treasury[of Abhidharma] says:Application of mindfulness [854] is knowledge: . . .16823) As for the aids, this knowledge is embraced by mindfulness and alertness.Through this, it is not forgotten and is associated with its congruent factors,which are the five omnipresent mental events that arise simultaneously with it,because the application [of mindfulness] is not accomplished if these [factors] arenot present. What one is “mindful” of is precisely this knowledge. “Intense”means not distant, that is, not interrupted by something else. “Application”means that the mind is fused with this mindfulness; it remains within the streamof mindfulness through alertness. Therefore, this is called “intense application ofmindfulness.”4) The way to meditatea) One’s own body and those of others are collections of impure phenomena.Through the intense mindfulness of the body, one understands that this is actu-ally the case. In particular, from among the twenty notions [to come], here one714The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 714"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"meditates on the [first] ten: the notions of (1) a dead person, (2) a repulsive corpse,(3) a putrid blue corpse, (4) a putrid black corpse, (5) a swollen corpse, (6) a mag-got-ridden corpse, (7) a mangled corpse, (8) a putrid red corpse, (9) a scatteredcorpse, and (10) dry bones.b) The intense mindfulness of feelings is the remedy for attachment to pleasantfeelings, aversion to suffering, and dullness toward neutral ones. In the sÒtras, itis repeatedly said:Everything contaminated is suffering.andThus, whatever you might feel, this is suffering.Accordingly, one meditates by understanding [feelings] in such a way. Here, thesuffering of suffering refers to everything that is evident as manifest suffering.The suffering of change is the entirety of those feelings to which one clings asbeing pleasant. The suffering of conditioned existence refers to any situation thatthis mere body that one has taken on and [its] mere mind or consciousness expe-rience from [one’s birth] onward. This suffering of conditioned existence is likeliving with a feeling of indifference when one’s [latent] disease of stomach can-cer has not yet matured. The suffering of change is like the delicious flavor whenone eats boiled rice mixed with poison. The suffering of suffering [855] is like theexperience of feeling ill when the poison [in the rice] has become active or likethe arising of an ulcer on top of [this] stomach cancer. In brief, [here] one shouldmeditate on the following six notions: (11) the notion that impermanent phe-nomena are suffering, (12) the notion that food is an adverse factor, (13) thenotion of disliking the whole world, (14) the notion of [its] defects, (15) the notionof relinquishing [it], and (16) the notion of being free from desire [for it].c) The intense mindfulness of mind is the remedy for clinging to mind as some-thing permanent and single. [The Buddha] said:Everything conditioned is impermanent.Accordingly, forms—clouds, steam, smoke, flames, and so on—do not remain assuch and such [forms] even for a moment. Also [phenomena] such as waterstreams and the movements of the wind do not remain for even one momentbeyond the specific [moment of] time [when they occur]. Their previous[moments] are not the following ones, and these again do not remain as their fol-lowing ones. When one examines mind with examples such as these, the mind—The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .715Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 715"},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"this mere stream of consciousness that experiences—does not remain for even amoment. Its previous [moment] is not the following one, and there is nothing inbetween the previous and the following moment. Hence, it does not last even forjust a moment and cannot be labeled as something single or multiple. [The intensemindfulness of mind] is what makes one understand this. Thus, [here] one shouldcultivate (17) the notion that everything conditioned is impermanent. d) The intense mindfulness of phenomena is the remedy for clinging to the phe-nomena constituent1683or the phenomena source1684—which is superimposed asthe object of the sixth consciousness (the mental [consciousness])—as being suchand such [phenomena]. One contemplates dependent origination in progressiveorder and reverse order. Additionally, in the great vehicle, one analyzes these[phenomena] with reasons and arguments, such as the freedom from unity andmultiplicity, and the refutation of arising from the four possibilities. Throughthis, one understands that bondage and release are not observable in any phe-nomenon whatsoever. Thus, [here] one meditates on (18) the notion of cessationand on (19) the notion of discriminatingly examining emptiness.5) The result[The result is] (20) the understanding that the fourfold mistakenness of clingingto these four—the body and so on—as something pure, pleasant, permanent,and an identity functions as the cause for acquiring bad places of birth. Hence,one is not attached to a body and does not wish for a body. [856] This is theunderstanding of [the reality of] suffering. Through understanding feelings assuffering, one is free from craving. This means to relinquish the origin [of suf-fering]. Through seeing that the basis to which one clings—the mind—is imper-manent, the clinging to “me” is reversed. Thus, one is free from the fear ofnirv› ̊a, from the concern that the self becomes extinct. Hence, one graduallymanifests cessation. Through being aware that all phenomena are not different,that is, spacelike emptiness and illusionlike dependent origination, one is freefrom ignorance. This means to engage in the reality of the path.By going beyond these four—contaminated body, feelings, mind, and phe-nomena—one attains mastery over uncontaminated body, feelings, mind, andphenomena. [The Distinction between the]Middle and Extremessays:Because of impregnations of negativity, because of craving’s cause,Because of the basis, and because of nonignorance,One engages in the four realities.Through this, one cultivates the applications of mindfulness.1685716The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 716"},{"pageNumber":718,"pageContent":"The applications of mindfulness of the inferior vehicle are as follows: With amind that strives for peace for one’s own sake, one meditates by focusing on justthe five aggregates that are seized by oneself and on just those other beings whodwell in places that are suitable to appear [to oneself].

So ifit appears that you have gained certainty that it is none of these[parts],what is thisso-called body?It is nothing but a mere name, just a superimposition.3.2.2.1.2. The Refutation of Something That Possesses the Body PartsIf this body were presentIn all of them as their exact match,Then the parts would of course dwell in the parts,But where would itself stay? [80]If the entire bodyWere present in the hands and such,There would be as many bodiesAs there are hands and so forth. [81]If the body does not exist inside nor outside,How could the body be in the hands and such?It also does not exist separate from the hands and so forth,So how could it possibly be found? [82]These three verses refute that the body abides in [any of] all [its] parts.Here, the Differentiators and others say, “These are [just] the parts of thebody, but the actual body that possesses these parts abides in such a way that itencompasses all [its] parts.” Also, some later Tibetans say, “The six [kinds of]parts (such as nectar, pus, and blood) abide within that which possesses theseparts (a bowl full of that which is wet and moistening).”1689Our objection1690to this is: If thisvery body were present in allits parts as theirexact match, then theindividual parts—like the eyes—would dwell injust theseindividual parts.1691If you state such a superimposition, it is of coursenothing butan imputation, butthen we ask:Where wouldthe body itself stayamong theseparts?Ifyou assert that this body—that is, the entire bodywith all its parts—wereto dwell ineach of the hands and so on, there would be as many bodies innumber as there are hands and so forth, such as the body that dwells in thehands and the body that dwells in the feet.Hence, there would be many bodies.[Moreover,] there would be the following consequences: The body that dwells inthe hands [would entail] two bodies, one in the right and one in the left [hand].The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .719Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 719"},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"Each of these [two bodies] in turn would have three [more] bodies that are relatedto its major joints, five bodies in the fingers, and fifteen bodies in the knucklesand so on, until finally there would be as many bodies as there are infinitesimalparticles [in the body]. Thus, you are not able to assert [such a position] for thefollowing reasons: If it were like this, [860] it would follow that each and every[body] part is the body. Therefore, your claim of an encompassing body thatpossesses its parts collapses. Furthermore, it is a most amazing feat indeed that asingle individual should have a number of bodies [that equals the number] ofinfinitesimal particles [in the body].Therefore, ifyou see that, when analyzed, noteven an atom of theso-calledbody exists anywhere outside, as an appearance of matter, nor inside, as an appear-ance of consciousness, how couldyou say, “The body isin the hands and such”?Even if you were to grind the hands and the like to dust, you would not find abody in them. You might assert then that there is a body that is not these [body]parts. [However,] in this case, the body would not be harmed even if you dissectit all the way down to its life force, because the body is something other than these[body parts]. Hence, each part—the hands and so forth—is not the body, and thebody also does not exist separate fromthese parts, so how could the body possi-bly be found?In this way, [the body] is understood to be a mere name.Thus, the body does not exist, but one perceives a bodyIn the hands and so on due to ignorance,Just as one may perceive a human being in some pileBecause of its specific configuration. [83]As long as the conditions are assembled,This figure1692looks like a person.Likewise, as long as such is the case for the hands and so forth,One will see a body there. [84]These two verses teach that [the perception of] a body is comparable to appre-hending a pile of stones as a human being.Thus,no matter whether it is something that possesses its parts or somethingelse, theso-called body does not existat all, but one perceives a body in theassembly of hands and so on. This happens due toa dull mind’s ignorance. It isjust like the following [example]: When one looks at a human being and somepile of stones from afar, they look similar in that they are just some dark shape[in the distance. Thus, it is merely] because of its specific configurationthatperceiving some pileleads to the thought, “A human beingappears.”You might say, “[Your example] is nothing but mistaking a pile of stones for720The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 720"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"a human being for just a moment, whereas the perception of hands and the likeas a body occurs over a long time.

Likewise, as long as such[an assembly of] causes and conditionsis the case for the hands and so forth, this will give rise to a cognition thatseesa body there.Hence, there is no difference.In the same way, what would a foot be,Since it is just a collection of toes?As these are collections of knuckles,The knuckles can likewise be divided into their parts. [85]Consequently, the parts too can be broken down into particles,And the particles may be divided into their directional parts.Since these directional divisions lack any parts,They are like space. Therefore, not even particles exist. [86]These two verses teach that, when analyzed, the body parts and their subparts alsoare not established.Not only is the apprehension of the body as a unit reversed in this way, butalso its parts are not established under analysis. In the same way, what would afoot be, since it is just a collection of toes? As these[toes]are collections ofknuckles, the knuckles[861] can likewise be divided into their parts. Conse-quently, the parts too can be broken down into particles, and the particles maybe divided into their directional parts. Since these directional divisions lackany parts, they are like space. Therefore, not even particles existas somethingthat can be observed.So which person who analyzesWould take delight in dreamlike forms?Once thus the body does not exist,What is a man and what is a woman?

Dueto this, it is impossible that pleasure ariseswhile suffering exists. Rather, it wouldfollow that it is never possible for pleasure to arise, since suffering ultimatelyexists. You might say, “Suffering does not ariseas something permanent bynature; it merely originates from an assembly of causes and conditions.” Ifthisis the case, this can only mean that this [suffering] appears in different situationsmerely due to an assembly of delusive causes and conditions.

The Application of Mindfulness of MindThis has two parts:1) Mind is not established.2) Objects are not established.3.2.2.3.1.

[103]The first six lines teach that mind does not withstand analysis, and the last twolines teach that it is pure from the very start.You might think, “Feelings exist, because the experiencer of feelings—themind—exists.” Cognizance or mind does not dwell in the senses,[869] nor inobjects, such as form, nordoes it dwell in betweenthese two. Hence, what doesnot dwell anywhere at all is not something that exists by its very nature. So who[or what] is the mind? If you examine this question, the mind is also not foundinside (as a sense faculty), noris the mind an outsideobject, noris it anywhereelsethan inside or outside as a mind that is something different [from sense fac-ulties and objects].Thus, if nobody sees the one who is the mind, what is it now that is labeled“mind”? You might think, “If mental cognition itself is a sense faculty, how couldit be that it does not dwell in the sense faculties?” In general, it is of course thecase that such [terms] as “mental sense faculty”1709and “mental conception”1710[are used] with reference to “mental cognition” as their basis of attribution. Dur-ing [mental cognition]’s [initial] phase of [manifesting as] nonconceptual per-ception, it is presented as “the [mental] sense faculty,” while its ensuing operation[as] apprehending conceptions is presented as “mental conception.” However,even in such cases it is not adequate to say, “The basis of attribution (mentalcognition) dwells in the attribute (the mental sense faculty).” This is just as inad-equate as saying, “The body dwells in the hand.” If you assert that mental cog-nition itself is the mental sense faculty, how could it be adequate that somethingdwells in itself? That something dwells in something [can only] refer to phe-nomena that are different, but how could you present [such a notion of] dwellingwith respect to [phenomena] that are not different?Thus, thatmental cognition which exists neither in the body nor anywhereother than the body, neither intermingledwith the bodynor in a way that itcould be seen separatelyfrom the body, is notseen as anythingat all that has anature of its own.Therefore, right from the start, the minds of sentient beingsare by nature completely liberatedand unaffected by discursiveness.3.2.2.3.2.

You might say, “Consciousness is first.”If it were the case that consciousness came before the knowable object, basedon what would this consciousness arise?[In fact, it does not arise,] because it can-not have any other object than its [specific] knowable object, and this knowableobject has not arisen yet.

Sowhere would thisposition that the seeming does not exist [872]leave the tworealities?This contradicts your earlier presentation of the two realities. [Fur-thermore,] the seeming is not put forward from the perspective that the seem-ing has a nature of its own. Rather, it is posited on the basis of another reason,that is, in terms of interdependence. This is comparable to when one conceivesof a mirage as water.

Dispelling the Consequence of Infinite Regress“Both conceiver and what is conceivedAre mutually dependent.”All analysis is expressedOn the basis of its accord with common consensus. [108]The first two lines state the objection, and the second two lines give the answer.You might say, “In dependence on a consciousness that is the conceiver, one734The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 734"},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"assigns a knowable object that is conceived.Likewise, one assigns consciousnessin dependence on what is conceived. When one does so, both consciousness andknowable objects are[just]mutually dependentconceptions. Therefore, one willnever be able to analyze [anything].”If one analyzes [consciousness and knowable objects] in such a way, they are[indeed] mutually dependent thoughts. Therefore, they are both not established,and [just] this is their ultimate state. Temporarily, however, in this context of pre-senting the seeming, one does not analyze these phenomena—such as form—about which there is common consensus between both debaters. It is from sucha perspective then that all analysis is expressed on the basis of this mere accordwith[such] common consensus.The reason for [such analysis] is that it is nec-essary to put an end to the wrong ideas of others. However, also the analysis itselfis not something that is real as such [an analysis] by its very nature.If what has been analyzedIs analyzed through further analysis,There is no end to it,Because that analysis would be analyzed too. [109]Once what had to be analyzed has been analyzed,The analysis has no basis left.Since there is no basis, it does not continue.This is expressed as nirv› ̊a. [110]The first two lines state the opponents’ answer [to the above] and the remaininglines eliminate their qualms.You might argue, “However, this analysis too must be analyzed by anotheranalysis.” In this case, it would definitely follow that if what has been analyzed isanalyzed through further analysis, there is no end to it, because that [further]analysis would be analyzed too. However, it is not like this: Knowledge is themeans that analyzes what had to be analyzed—the wrong ideas of the opponents—in a way that it [addresses] all [of these wrong ideas], however many they may be.Oncethe wrong ideas of the opponents have been analyzedwith [this knowl-edge], they are put to an end. As soon as they have come to an end, the purposeof the analysis is accomplished, and therefore, also the analysis itself will subside onits own. Thus, it is nothing more than an analysis for this specific purpose. How-ever, the analysisin itself has noparticular basisor nature. [874] Since there is nobasisor purposeleft, thisvery analysis does not continueafter wrong ideas havebeen put to an end,just as a fire goes out on its own as soon as the firewood isburned up. As The SÒtra of[the Prophecy of the Young Lady] Excellent Moon1717says:The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .735Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 735"},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"“O young lady, who gave you this self-confidence of yours?” “TheElder himself imparted it [to me], because this self-confidence of minewould not have arisen if the Elder had not questioned [me].”Once clinging in terms of superimposition and denial has come to an end insuch a way, just this empty and luminous nature of phenomena in which thereis nothing to be removed or added is the fundamental state of phenomena. Thisis expressed asprimordial nirv› ̊aas such. Thus, since no conditioned or uncon-ditioned phenomena whatsoever are observed [at this point], there is no groundfor apprehending them as something positive or negative either. This is the per-fect application of mindfulness of phenomena. [As The SÒtra Requested by CrownJewel] says:MañjuŸrı, if someone does not observe positive or negative phenom-ena, then this is someone who intensely applies the mindfulness ofphenomena that inspects phenomena.[Synopsis of Other Commentaries]As for [verse 106], Kaly› ̊adeva formulates some quite speculative objections:If one definitely examines the explanation that—on the seeming levelof this—cognitions exist by nature, then they also do not exist, sinceself-awareness is not established. Therefore, actually, both realities donot exist. Or, if the seeming becomes the seeming through some othercauses or due to something later, it is established as something separate.Therefore, sentient beings could not pass into nirv› ̊a. Since the seem-ing is labeled as something other, where would there be a nirv› ̊a forsentient beings? In some [other] editions [of ⁄›ntideva’s text], [line106d] reads, “Hence, there is no nirv› ̊a.” To this [phrase, we say]:However, if it is established that [nirv› ̊a] is another seeming, it is takenas another one. Hence, sentient beings would not pass into nirv› ̊a.[He continues with the answer:]“Conceptions in the minds of others” [in line 107a refers to] “of oth-ers” or “others.” This refers to the seeming, which is the conceptionthat a mind exists as the continuum of another one or as a later modeof being. When [the text] says “mind” [here], this is distinguishedfrom the “conceiver”1718of the Grammarians. What is labeled “mind”in other theses [875] is not what is to be identified here, because this736The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 736"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"discussion essentially concerns itself with practice [and not philo-sophical theories]. To say “conception” [here] indicates that this mindis mere delusion. Therefore, [line 107b] says, “not in terms of theirown . . .” You might wonder, “So who are these others?” This is [indi-cated] by [line 107b] “they do not exist in terms of their own seeming.”That which does not exist as one’s own seeming [in the first place] issubsequently ascertained through analysis as nothing but nonexistent.Before this [analysis], there was this aspect of an unquestioned, satis-fying presence [of things]. As [The Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning] says:In the beginning, those who search for true realityShould be told that everything exists.Later, when they have realized actualityAnd lack attachment, they are free.1719If [things really] existed before they were examined, one would not beable to eliminate them even through later examination.1720Thus, it appears that, explicitly, [Kaly› ̊adeva] proves that the seeming is sim-ply nonexistent by its nature. [Actually,] however, he seems to explain the fol-lowing: The mere, simple presence of the objects of clinging when they are notexamined is not contradictory to their nonexistence when they are analyzed.VibhÒticandra sets up the following objections:“If all phenomena are unarisen and unceasing, the seeming does notexist. Thus, conventionality is not established. Since ultimate reality isthen the one and only reality that is established, the two realities, merit,and such would not exist. If such a seeming that is assigned by thecognitions of the continua of others were to exist, then ultimate real-ity would not be the only one. However, if this seeming is assigned bythe conceptual cognitions of others, where should there be a nirv› ̊afor sentient beings? Since emptiness too is taken as an object by con-ceptions, it would then be the seeming. [Furthermore,] through therealization of the ultimate, all discursiveness is no longer observed.Therefore, which sentient beings would pass into nirv› ̊a? And if theywere to proceed toward nirv› ̊a, it would then be through mentalobservation. Also, since nirv› ̊a is expressed by seeming cognitions, ittoo would be the seeming.”[Verse 107] “They are . . .” is the answer [to this]. Since nirv› ̊a is takenas an object of the cognitions of people who explain [about it] and areThe Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .737Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 737"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"different from those who have passed into nirv› ̊a, it is [just] these con-ceptions of theirs. Therefore, it is not reasonable that nirv› ̊a is theseeming; it is just nirv› ̊a. [876] Why? It does not exist based on one’sown seeming, because all one’s own conceptions have ceased in it. Youmight wonder, “How then should it [exist] due to the seeming of oth-ers?” This is stated in [lines 107cd] “Later, when this has been verified. . .” The conceptions of others appear to yogins through dependentorigination: “If this exists, that originates.” Since [yogins] verify theconceptions of others during the aftermath of the actual part of theirmain meditative concentration, for the yogins, the seeming exists. Thevajralike meditative concentration is the Dharma Body of the Buddhas,which is the nonobservation of any phenomenon. From this [mani-fests] the Body of Complete Enjoyment, the six supernatural knowl-edges, and omniscience. This is the mirrorlike wisdom, because allentities appear in the mirror of wisdom inasfar as it is suitable for past,future, present, distant, or close phenomena to show [in it].You might ask, “However, since the past and the future do not exist,how could they appear?” The following is stated: Distance in time isjust like distance in space, because the wheel of the six kinds [of beings]has neither beginning nor end. Since the amazing Buddhas are thesources of merit and knowledge, they see what is distant in space andby nature. Likewise, why should they not see what is distant in time,such as the past? Since the same reasoning applies in both [cases], theysee the wheel of the six kinds [of beings] that is free from a beginning,an end, and something in between. Thus, it is established that beingshave no beginning and that the Teacher is omniscient. This explana-tion does not deal with the following question: “Since the [beginningand end of] cyclic existence are not known, if it is without beginningand end, how is omniscience established?” Rather, [it says that] thewheel of the six kinds [of beings] has neither beginning nor end andis still directly seen. Therefore, [it is said]:For the omniscient ones,Beings without exception appear like the present.In dependence on the view of ordinary people,Threefold distance is explained.1721As for the Body of Complete Enjoyment, due to the influence of thoseto be trained and [previous] aspiration prayers, it also [entails] theEmanation Body, the wisdom of equality [877], and so forth.

You mightargue, “However, what is the basis of analyzing the seeming then? Itis not the seeming, since this has been refuted. It is not the ultimate[either], since it is impossible to analyze it.” We say: In order to makepeople understand, here [all worldly analysis] is expressed in depend-ence on entities and analyses as these are common consensus in theworld.1722Thus, he explains the meaning of the two lines [107ab] “They are . . .” as fol-lows: At the time when latent tendencies are vanquished by the vajralike medi-tative concentration, the seeming does not exist from the point of view of a natureof its own.

[Line 107d] “If it has not, the seeming does notexist at all” means: If the cause exists, [resultant ignorance and suffer-ing] exist. However, if one’s own continuum does not experience [itsown] causes and results independently of the conceptions of others,[these causes and results] are nonexistent even on the seeming level,just like the horns of a rabbit.This comment on [verse 107] means the following: No matter how something ismentally labeled by others, if it is not experienced by oneself, then it does not exist[for oneself] even on the seeming level. On the other hand, if it is experienced byoneself, it is presented as something that exists on the seeming level.The Small Commentary on the Knowledge Chapter Onlycomments:[Verse 106] “In this case . . .” anticipates the qualms of others whomight say, “The seeming is imputed by other seeming [phenomena]:The conception of a mirage as water is an imputation by other seem-ing cognitions for which [something] appears as water. Likewise, evena Buddha who has passed into nirv› ̊a is observed by the conscious-nesses of others, such as bodhisattvas.

You might continue, “Buddhasthemselves experience their own consciousnesses, which are their ownseeming. Therefore, these exist on the seeming level.” [879] That thisis not the case [is shown in line 107b] “But they do not exist in termsof their own seeming.” If you assert [the existence of] this seeming inBuddhas, then they have seeming consciousnesses.

Ifall phenomena are without arising, the seeming does not exist. Hence, where arethe two realities? One labels the seeming as existent, if it is ascertained that asubsequent result arises from a cause that preceded it. One also labels, “If thereis no arising of this [result], the seeming does not exist.” Actually, conscious-nesses and knowable objects do not exist.

If the seeming werean imputation by the mistaken cognitions of others, then sentientbeings would by their very nature not pass into nirv› ̊a.” This seem-ing is nothing but the conceptions of the minds of others, that is, ofthose in cyclic existence. Therefore, when analyzed, it does not exist.Nirv› ̊a’s own nature is not this that appears as the seeming. Rather,[880] it abides as the unchanging ultimate. When there is the certaintyand understanding that results are what subsequently originate fromcauses, then causes and results that are real as mere appearances exist.Hence, the presentation of the two realities is justified.

Teaching That There Are No Means to Prove [Real] EntitiesThose for whom these two are realHave a very hard time with it. [111ab]These two lines give a brief introduction.[881] [There are] the systems of the realists for whom these two, the analyzerand the object of analysis, are realby their very entities. However, they have avery hard time with this pair of a real analyzer and a real object of analysis.Hence, nobody can establish them, because the analyzer and the object of analy-sis mutually depend on each other, and neither exists independently.If objects are established by virtue of consciousness,What support for the existence of consciousness do you have? [111cd]“Well, consciousness is established by virtue of knowable objects.”So what support is there for the existence of knowable objects?“They exist by virtue of each other.”Then neither of these two exists. [112]These six lines teach that consciousness and knowable objects are not established.Ifyou proponents of [outer] referents say, “Outer objects, such as form, areestablished by virtue of consciousness,” please tell us first what supportor jus-tification for the existence of consciousness you have.You might answer, “Well,the subject—consciousness—is established by virtue ofthe existence of itsobjects, that is, knowable objects.” So what argument is thereto support the742The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 742"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"existence ofits knowable objects?You will say, “Since knowable objects areestablished by virtue of consciousness, and consciousness is established by virtueof knowable objects, they exist by virtue ofbeing dependent on each other.”Good enough—then neither of these two existsindependently, because know-able objects do not exist independently of consciousness, and consciousness doesnot exist independently of knowable objects.If there is no father without a son,Where would a son come from?If there is no son, there is no father.Likewise, these two do not exist. [113] This verse explains the example for such [dependent existence].For example, one speaks about a son in dependence on him having beenengendered by a father and about a father in dependence on having engendereda son. Therefore, without a sonwho has been engendered by him, there is nofather.Likewise, if there is no father, where would his son come from?

Teaching the Means to Invalidate This [Notion of Entities]This has two parts:1) The general topic2) The meaning of the text4.2.1. The General TopicIn general, in the context of Centrism, [there are] five great reasons that elimi-nate discursiveness.1) The reason of dependence, or dependent origination[This can be formulated] in terms of a negation: “These mere appearances as thesubject do not exist by their nature, because they are something dependent, justlike an illusion.”[It can] also [be stated as] an affirming argument: “These [appearances] as thesubject are also not nonexistent like the horns of a rabbit, because they are somethingdependent.” This latter [formulation] is for the sake of presenting the seeming.744The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 744"},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"There are two types of dependence:a) dependence in the sense of dependent arising, such as the arising of light dueto the arising of a butter lampb) dependence in the sense of dependent imputation, such as short in depend-ence on longThe Precious Garlandsays:Due to the existence of this, that comes to be,For example, just as something short when there is something long.Due to the arising of this, that arises,Just as light due to the appearance of a butter lamp.1727In this text [The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life,this reasoning] is notdeliberately taught, because one understands it implicitly from the teaching thatall phenomena are illusionlike.Apart from this [reasoning, there are] four other negating arguments:2) The analysis of a nature: the freedom from unity and multiplicity“A sprout as the subject is not actually [883] established, because it is not estab-lished either as a unity or as a multiplicity.” In the present [text], [this reasoning]is included in [the section on] the application of mindfulness and others.3) The analysis of the way of arising—the refutation of arising from the four pos-sibilities1728—will be implicitly understood from the refutation of arising.1729Therefore, the [remaining] two [reasonings]—the analysis of the cause (thevajra sliver [argument]) and the analysis of the result (the argument that refutesan arising of existents and nonexistents) —will be explicitly explained here.4) The vajra sliver argument1730Just like a vajra, [this argument] is unobstructed with respect to anything what-soever. Therefore, it is called “vajra slivers.” It is to be explained as it is found inThe Fundamental Verses on Centrism:Not from themselves, not from something other,Not from both, and not without a cause—At any place and any time,All entities lack arising.1731The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .745Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 745"},{"pageNumber":747,"pageContent":"Thus, the positions of the Hedonists1732who assert that there is no cause, theEnumerators who assert that [entities] arise from themselves, and the Nudes1733who assert that [entities] arise from both are refuted by all texts of Centrism andvalid cognition. The assertion that [entities] arise from something other, whichis the position of our [other] three [Buddhist] factions—the Mere Mentalistsand the [two schools] below them—is eliminated through Centrist texts [alone].The oral pith instructions on Centrism by my mentor, the Omniscient Vic-tor,1734say:“A sprout as the subject is without arising, because it is free fromarising from any of the four extremes, just as a frog’s long hair.”Here, master Bhavya states [this as] the main argument and then for-mulates four autonomous reasons as the means to prove the subjectproperty. The venerable and fearless Candrakırti presents this by label-ing the mere refutation of arising from the four extremes a “position.”He teaches the invalidation of the opposite [positions] of this [refuta-tion] through consequences that reveal contradictions and throughthe analogous applicability of the [opponents’] reason [to somethingthat contradicts their position]. However, he does not formulate amain argument, nor does he assert arguments that establish the subjectproperty through valid cognition. It is merely on the grounds of this[difference] that one refers to Autonomists and Consequentialists.However, it is not that [884] there were any differences in terms ofbetter or worse in the views of these two. The reasons for this are: Bothaccept the freedom from discursiveness in which all complexes of dis-cursiveness have been ended without exception. Not even the Omnis-cient Ones would see a difference in terms of better or worse betweenthe ways in which these two put an end to discursiveness.One might wonder, “How can this be? There is a slight remainder ofdiscursiveness left in the view of the Autonomists.” This is not thecase, because the texts of Autonomists are much clearer in their way ofteaching freedom from discursiveness than the texts of venerable Can-drakırti. The Ornament of Centrismsays:Because [“nonarising”] concords with the ultimate,This is called “the ultimate.”In actuality, it is the releaseFrom all complexes of discursiveness.746The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 746"},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"Since arising and so forth do not exist,Nonarising and so on are impossible.Since their nature has been negated,Their verbal terms are impossible.There is no good formulationTo negate nonexistent objects.[Nonarising and such] depend on conceptionsAnd thus are seeming, not actual.1735[The Distinction between] the Two Realitiesagrees:Since the negation of arising and so onConcords with actuality, we accept it.Since there is nothing to be negated,It is clear that, actually, there is no negation.How should the negation of an imputation’sOwn nature not be an imputation?Hence, seemingly, this isThe meaning of actuality, but not actuality [itself].In actuality, both do not exist.This is the lack of discursiveness:MañjuŸrı asked about actualityAnd the son of the Victors remained silent.1736This is extensively taught in other [texts] too. The school of Yoga Prac-tice explains this as the wisdom that is empty of the duality of appre-hender and apprehended and free from discursiveness. From theperspective of this wisdom itself, it is definitely free from discursive-ness, but, in general, a [certain] remainder of discursiveness is left.Therefore, this is not all-encompassing freedom from discursiveness.Thus, the differences between Autonomists and Consequentialists [interms of ground, path, and fruition] are as follows: In the context ofthe ground, there is the difference that [Autonomists] present theseeming in accordance with proponents of philosophical systems [suchas the SÒtra Followers or the Yog›c›ras] and that [Consequentialists]present it in accordance with common worldly consensus.1737Whenpresenting the ultimate, [Autonomists] accept objects (that is, seemingThe Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .747Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 747"},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"[phenomena]) that bear the nature of phenomena, while [Conse-quentialists] do not accept this. [885] [Another difference is] that[Autonomists] accept valid cognition that is undeceiving with respectto objects (that is, conventional reality), and [Consequentialists] donot accept it.In the context of the path, [Autonomists] settle in meditative equipoisewithin spacelike emptiness of appearance, and [Consequentialists] set-tle in meditative equipoise within illusionlike emptiness of reality.In the context of the result, they differ in that [Autonomists state that]the aspects of the seeming emerge within the self-appearances of thewisdom that knows the extent, while such is not the case [for Conse-quentialists]. They also have a different [opinion] as to whether dis-cursiveness is ended gradually or all at once.For those with sharp faculties who take the instantaneous approach,the Consequentialist [approach] is better, and for those with weakerfaculties who take the gradual approach, the Autonomist [approach] isbetter. Some [aspects] of the seeming [reality] of yogins have to beaccepted by both Autonomists and Consequentialists after analysisthrough reasoning, such as the four seals of the view that are a sign ofthe Buddha’s speech and the aspect of emptiness of reality free from dis-cursiveness. It is not that these [aspects] are presented as the seemingfrom the point of view of having been analyzed [and found] throughreasoning. Rather, they are presented as the seeming from the point ofview of [still] apprehending characteristics in what is analyzed.[Now follows the actual explanation of the vajra sliver reasoning:a) The refutation of the first extreme: arising from itself]There is no arising [of an entity] from itself for the following reasons: If it is notyet present, it does not exist, which makes it unsuitable as a cause. If it is alreadypresent, it would be pointless that something that is already present arises again.Moreover, it would follow then that it arises forever without reaching an end. Inhis Lucid Words, [Candrakırti] quotes Buddhap›lita’s commentary [onN›g›rjuna’s Fundamental Verses]:There is no arising of entities from themselves, because their arisingwould be pointless and because it would be completely absurd. There748The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 748"},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"is no need for entities that [already] exist as their own identity to ariseagain. Why is that? If they were to arise although they [already] exist,there would be no time when they do not arise.1738[In his Lamp of Knowledge], master Bh›vaviveka formulates this as an auto -nomous reason:It is certain that, ultimately, there is no arising of the inner sourcesfrom themselves, because they [already] exist, for example, like an exis-tent consciousness.1739Master Candrakırti objects to this:Why do you introduce this distinction “ultimately” here? [886] Youmight answer, “My reasons are: To accept arising on the seemingworldly level is not what is to be negated. Moreover, even if [this aris-ing] were negated, it follows that [such a negation] would [still] beinvalidated through what [the world] accepts.” This is not reasonable,because an arising from itself is not accepted even on the seeming level.. . . You might argue, “This distinction is made in dependence on thesystems of others.” This is also not reasonable, because their presenta-tions are not accepted even on the seeming level. Even worldly peopledo not think that [entities] arise from themselves. Worldly people[simply] do not engage in such analyses as whether [things arise] fromthemselves or others. All they think is that “results originate fromcauses.” Also master [N›g›rjuna] presented this in such a way. There-fore, it is certain that “this distinction is meaningless in all aspects.” Furthermore, if you wanted to refute arising on the seeming level andthus set up this distinction, then the flaw of a subject that is anunestablished base or the mistake of an argument that is an unestab-lished base falls upon yourself, because, ultimately, you yourself donot claim the sources, such as the eyes. . . . You might say, “Becausewe refute that the seeming, such as the eyes, arises ultimately, to say‘ultimately’ indicates a special case of refuting arising.” Well, if thiswere your concern, you should say, “Seeming [entities], such as theeyes, are ultimately without arising . . .” [However,] you did not teachsuch a phrase.1740If one were to insert “ultimately” in order to refute an arising on the seeminglevel that is claimed by worldly people or the Enumerators, [this is pointless,The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .749Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 749"},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"since] they do not present the two realities but merely assert that “[entities] sim-ply arise.” This was all that the venerable master N›g›rjuna has refuted. Thus, thisis not a refutation by differentiating the two realities. Since worldly people do notclaim that [entities] arise from themselves, [887] there is no purpose in inserting“ultimately.” [Furthermore,] if this were done in order to refute arising on theseeming level, since master Bh›vaviveka himself does not assert that, ultimately,the sources, such as the eyes, exist, then to set up “exist” as the reason [in hisautonomous reasoning above] would be a nonapplying argument. If [this inser-tion of “ultimately”] were made for the sake of understanding that the eyes andso on are the seeming, there is the mistake of not arriving at this meaning, since[in order to do so] one would have to say, “Seeming [entities], such as the eyes,are ultimately without arising . . .”By refuting [Bh›vaviveka in this way, Candrakırti] asserts that there is neverany arising from the four extremes, whether it is in worldly and non-Buddhistcontexts of no analysis in terms of the two realities or whether it is in the Bud-dhist context of presenting the two realities. However, then [there are] those laterTibetans who presume to be Consequentialist Centrists and who are in the tightgrip of dense referential views. They proclaim, “When one sets up Centrist rea-sons, there is the flaw of denying the seeming, if one does not insert ‘ultimately,’‘actually,’ or ‘when analyzed.’” [There are] also those who talk about the threephases of no analysis, slight analysis, and intense analysis [in this context]. Fromwhat Candrakırti [said above], it is very clear that [such people] are not follow-ers of this master.Thus, also the following explanation is nothing but [an attempt to] make somepale yellow metal look like the finest gold from the river Jambu: “Without analy-sis, I accept [entities] in accordance with common worldly consensus. Underslight analysis, I accept such [positions] as the following: Cyclic existence does notexist and, when distinguishing the pure essence1741[of wisdom mind] from thedross1742[of ordinary consciousness], the dross is necessarily that which does notexist.1743At the point of intense analysis, if you ask me what the ultimate is, I donot say anything at all.”[Actually,] in the Centrist system itself, the phase of no analysis through rea-soning refers to the cycle [of teachings] that first puts an end to what is not mer-itorious, which is the vehicle that [leads to] the higher realms. The intermediatephase of putting an end to identity means to counteract [all types of] clinging ofBuddhist and non-Buddhist philosophical systems with Centrist reasonings. Thephase of putting an end to all bases for views refers to the final complete elimi-nation of [any] clinging to true reality. Hence, there is no need for anybody toreduce these [phases] or add anything to them. [888] Once one relates all thesethree [phases of no analysis, slight analysis, and intense analysis] solely to theintermediate phase of putting an end to identity, one develops clinging to the750The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 750"},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"nonexistence of the dross and clinging to the existence of the pure essence. [More-over,] one considers merely not giving an answer as the ultimate actuality. Forthose who understand the meaning of Centrism, this [mistaken presentation] cer-tainly provides a good chance for a laugh. However, for some ignorant people whowish for liberation, it still serves as an issue that makes them tremble with awe.Therefore, it is explained that when MañjuŸrı asked Vimalakırti about the per-fect actuality, the genuine answer [in this case] was to not give an answer. How-ever, when one naïve being does not give an answer to the question of anotherone, how could these two cases ever be comparable? Please understand the dif-ference between a bodhisattva in his last existence who dwells under the bodhitree and Devadatta who is sitting under a nimba tree. If you think, “These arecomparable,” then just ask an ox about the ultimate and you will get the finalanswer that you wish for [from this ox].b) The refutation of the second extreme [that is, arising from something other]:[Candrakırti’s Lucid Wordsquotes Buddhap›lita on this]:Master Buddhap›lita says:Things are without arising from something other, because [oth-erwise] it would follow that everything arises from everything.1744Venerable Candrakırti himself says:Things also do not arise from something other, because there is noth-ing other.1745In The Entrance[into Centrism], he states:If something were to originate in dependence on something other than it,Well, then utter darkness would spring from flamesAnd everything would arise from everything. Why?[Also] everything that does not produce [this] is the same in beingother.1746Furthermore, if [entities] were to arise from causes and conditions, [as The Fun-damental Versessays, there] are only four conditions:Conditions are fourfold: Causal,Observed, immediate,The Ninth Chapter of Pawo Rinpoche’s Commentary . . .751Center Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 751"},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"And dominant.There is no fifth condition.1747For example, the nature of a rice sprout does not exist in any of [its conditions:]neither in its causal condition (water and manure), nor in its observed condition(the harvest), not in its immediate condition [889] (the last moment of the seed),and also not in its dominant condition (the person who plants [the seed]):The nature of entitiesDoes not exist in conditions and such.1748When one analyzes this with [the reasoning of] the freedom from unity andmultiplicity, then if an [entity] in itself is not established, where should there besomething other that depends [for its otherness] on this [first entity]?If an entity in itself does not exist,An entity other [than it] does not exist either.1749If conditions (such as water and manure) have functions (such as producing asprout), they would have to produce sprouts all the time. If they do not have anyfunctions, there would never be any function.

Teaching That the Cognition That Negates the Existence of Objects Is a Valid Cognition“If valid cognition is not valid cognition,Isn’t what is validated by it delusive?In true reality, the emptiness of entitiesIs therefore unjustified.” [138]1784[903] This verse states the objection.The opponents might say, “Ifyou assert in your Centrist system that even allvalid cognition—which is the means of evaluation—is not valid cognition, isn’ta phenomenon that is validated by it delusivetoo?

[139]This verse teaches that [everything] is mere delusion.Without referring to—that is, without relying on—amere imputed entity,oneis also notable to apprehendor presentthe lack of this entity, which isemptiness. The reason is that if one does not rely on the conventional term [ornotion of] space, one is not able to present space as [referring to] the lack of anyentities.1785Therefore,since sentient beings cling to the reality of delusive enti-tiesthat are mere appearances, they plunge into cyclic existence. If one under-stands that these very [appearances] are unreal and illusionlike, this[understanding] surely serves as the remedy for the [clinging to reality]. However,emptiness—which is this imputation in the sense of the lack of such delusive[appearances] that appear as entities—is clearly delusivetoo. In the same way asan illusory lion kills an illusory elephant, this is [nothing more than] engaging inthe [particular] reification of understanding emptiness as the remedy for the reifi-cation that conceives of real [entities].Thus, when one’s son dies in a dream,The conception “He does not exist”Removes the thought that he does exist,But it is also delusive. [140]This verse teaches that the [cultivation of emptiness] is the remedy for reification.Thus,if one experiences in a dreamthat one’s sonhas been born and thendies,inasmuch as this is a dream, there is definitely no difference between the[son]’s birth and his death. Still, due to one’s seeing [in the dream] that he hasbeen born, there arises the mental state that conceives, “My son exists.” Whenthere is the appearance that he has died, there emerges the conception “My sonhas died and now he does not exist,”[904] which removes the thoughtthat fan-cies, “My son does exist.”However, since both—the existence and the nonexis-tence of this son too—are equal in being a dream, they are alike in being delusive.770The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 770"},{"pageNumber":772,"pageContent":"4.2.2.1.5.

[He continues:]Again, you might say, “When this permanent [pleasure] is clearlymanifest, it appears as pleasure. However, when its full potential is notclearly manifest, it does not appear.” This is refuted by [lines 132ab]“If there is clearly manifest pleasure and such . . .” . . . You mightargue, “The phases of being gross and subtle are different, but sincethere is no difference in the basis of these phases—pleasure andsuch—there is no mistake.” The objection to this is [found in lines133ab] “If it becomes subtle only upon ceasing to be gross . . .” Youmight think, “The basis of these phases is permanent.” This is refutedby lines [134ab] “If the grossness of pleasure is not something otherthan it . . .”1787As for [line 137d] “Then their perceptions of manifest things would not be trueeither,” he says:This demonstrates that the existence of sound and such is perceived assomething manifest. [Here,] the term “either” teaches that what existsin inferences and scriptures would not be true either.1788He explains that [verse 143] “What is created by illusion . . .” also belongs to thissection. [905]The Small Commentary on the Knowledge Chaptersays:When stating these [lines 132ab] “If there is clearly manifest pleasureand such, . . .” master [⁄›ntideva] had in mind that it is the positionof the Enumerators to express the assembly of the result with the term“clear manifestation.”1789[In The Small Commentary the objection in verse 138] that emptiness is unjusti-fied receives the following answer:We do not say, “Emptiness is the negation of both entity and nonen-tity.” The reason for this is that, ultimately, the negation of these is notcapable of making concrete phenomena in the three times into [phe-nomena that have] the nature of a negation. You might ask, “So whatis [emptiness] then?” It is that which is superimposed as the nature [ofall phenomena], because a purpose entails something that serves thispurpose.1790772The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-04 6/30/09 9:38 AM Page 772"},{"pageNumber":774,"pageContent":"[The Small Commentary’s] concluding summary [of this section] explains that“without a cause,” “individual,” “combined,” and “coming from somethingother” [in verses 141–142] are, in due order, a synopsis of the refutations of the fol-lowing [opponents]: those who say that there are no causes, the followers ofÊŸvara, other opponents, and those who say that [entities] shift in time.1791Thenit adduces the passages in [verses 143–144] “What is created by illusions . . .” asthe proof for this [statement].17924.2.2.2.

(In thedescription below, I follow the former distinction.) Some of the non-BuddhistIndian schools—the systems of the early Vedas and the Epics, the Ved›nta, theYoga, and the bh›kti traditions—are not addressed below, since they are notmentioned either in the Bodhicary›vat›raor in Pawo Rinpoche’s commentary.Thus, the following is only a brief outline of those non-Buddhist philosophicalsystems that are relevant in ⁄›ntideva’s text. It is not meant as a comprehensiveexposition of the positions of these schools.1840Orthodox Schools That Adhere to the VedasMım› ̇saka(Tib. dpyod pa pa), “Analyzers.” The main text of this school isJaimini’s Mım› ̇sasÒtra(about 200 CE), though the system of thought itself ismuch older. Originally, the Mım› ̇sakas were not at all concerned with philos-ophy but with systematizing and harmonizing the extensive ritual precepts inthe Vedas, which were considered an eternal, unauthored, and unmistaken rev-elation. Thus, mım› ̇sarefers to the analysis of the principles that determinethe interpretation of these sacred texts. In the course of the development of otherphilosophical systems, there appeared the need for justifying the ultimate authen-ticity of the Vedas through rational investigation. However, except for theacknowledgment of a supernatural sphere of being and the Vedas as that whichenables one to gain knowledge about it, the philosophical theory that evolved outof this need for vindication is pure empiricism. In being of a realistic and plu-ralistic outlook, it largely follows the Ny›ya-VaiŸe ̋ika system and contains onlyminor elements that are related to the philosophic passages of the Vedas (thesefeatures are close to the Ved›nta). The Analyzers’ main arguments for the unmis-takenness and self-existence of the Vedas are that knowledge is self-valid and thatthese texts are an expression of omnipresent eternal sound.1841Similar to the Enu-merators, they understand the relation between cause and result as being one ofCenter Sunlit-05 6/30/09 9:39 AM Page 794"},{"pageNumber":796,"pageContent":"identity in difference.1842The description of the self and how it becomes liberatedis very similar to what the Ny›ya-VaiŸe ̋ikas say. However, unlike the other ortho-dox schools that mainly rely on the cultivation of meditation and wisdom inorder to achieve liberation of the self, the Mım› ̇sakas strongly emphasize thatsuch liberation can only come about through the strict application of the ritualsand proper ways of conduct that are prescribed in the Vedas. Naiy›yika(Tib. rigs pa can pa), “Logicians.” The school originated with Gau-tama (a.k.a. Ak ̋ap›da), the author of the Ny›yasÒtra(its oldest commentary isPak ̋ilasv›mı V›tsy›yana’s Ny›yabh› ̋ya, fifth century CE). The Logicians blendedthe old Indian natural philosphy with an extensive system of logic and dialectics.Many of their views, such as on the self, ÊŸvara, and causation, accord with thoseof the Differentiators, and eventually the two merged to form the Ny›ya-VaiŸe ̋ika school. However, the Differentiators treat the existence of things fromthe ontological point of view, while the Logicians are more concerned about epis-temology, that is, how things are known or validated. They present sixteen cat-egories that constitute the world, the main ones being valid cognition or meansof knowledge1843(perception, inference, verbal testimony, and analogy)1844andwhat is to be evaluated1845by these means (which includes all seven categories ofthe Differentiators).S› ̇khya(Tib. grangs can pa), “Enumerators.” The school claims that its originsgo back to the Vedic mythical sage Kapila, to whom the composition of theS› ̇khyasÒtrais ascribed.1846The classical scripture is the S› ̇khyak›rik›byÊŸvarak ̧ ̋na (fifth century CE) Its followers are called Enumerators because theyenumerate twenty-five factors that make up the universe. The original distinctionthat this system makes is between (1) prak ̧ti1847—the infinite, single, and uncon-scious primal substance—and (2) puru ̋a1848(person, self, or ›tman), which is infi-nite consciousness. The primal substance is permanent, partless, all-pervading, yetimperceptible. It is described as the primordial undifferentiated equilibrium ofthe three “constituents”:1849motility, darkness, and lightness.1850Rajas(literally,passion) stands for whatever is active and energetic, tamasfor what is coarse andheavy, and sattvafor everything that is fine and light. When related to what isexperienced by the puru ̋a, in due order, they correspond to suffering, dullness,and pleasure or to hatred, ignorance, and desire respectively. However, since thepuru ̋a itself is not derived from the primal substance, it lacks these three quali-ties. Each sentient being has a puru ̋a, which is permanent but is not an agent foranything. It is pure sentience, the experiencer of pleasure, pain, and all manifes-tations of the prak ̧ti. It is said to be neither a cause nor a result, neither the pri-mal substance itself nor one of its manifestations. In other words, itindependently exists in and by itself.Appendix 2: Non-Buddhist Indian Schools795Center Sunlit-05 6/30/09 9:39 AM Page 795"},{"pageNumber":797,"pageContent":"Except for the puru ̋a, all other manifold appearances of the world manifest outof the primal matter and are nothing but various expressions or perturbations ofthis single nature (thus, the implication that things arise from themselves). Theseexpressions are called “universal flux”1851or “manifestations”1852and are regardedas illusory. In this process of gradual evolution of the world’s complexity, first,(3) cognition, or “the great one,”1853splits off from its original unity with thispermanent “nature.” This cognition (which in itself is matter) is like a two-sidedmirror, in which outside objects and the person on the inside meet like reflec-tions. Thus, the puru ̋a can experience the manifestations only through this cog-nition, which renders the senses cognizant and apprehends the objects that theseperceive. These in turn are then known by the person and trigger his or her expe-riences of pleasure or pain. Cognition produces (4) identification,1854which standsfor the basic mistaken tendency of the puru ̋a to identify itself with the manifes-tations of the prak ̧ti, become entangled in them, and thus suffer. From this prin-ciple, the remaining twenty-one manifestations evolve. These are (5–9) the five“essential elements,”1855such as sound; (10–20) the eleven faculties; and (21–25)the five elements. The eleven “faculties” consist of (10–14) the five sense faculties,(15–19) the five physical faculties (speech, arms, legs, anus, genitalia), and (20) themental faculty, or thinking.According to the Enumerators, cyclic existence comes from the puru ̋a’s desireto enjoy objects, which perturbs the natural equilibrium of the primal substanceand leads to all the various forms in which this manifests as objects. When onediminishes one’s desire through cultivating the meditative concentrations of theform realm and the formless realm, one develops the divine eye. When this eyelooks at the prak ̧ti, the individual realizes that the objects are nothing but illu-sory expressions of the primal substance. It is said that when the primal sub-stance has been spotted in this way, it becomes embarrassed and all itsmanifestations merge back into it. Liberation is attained when these manifesta-tions have ceased and the puru ̋a remains alone.This system was also adopted by Patañjali and his followers as the main philo-sophical foundation of the classic school of Yoga. In contrast to the nontheisticS› ̇khyas, however, the followers of Patañjali assert the existence of ÊŸvara andthat the manifestation of the phenomenal world depends on his intent.VaiŸe ̋ika(Tib. bye brag pa), “Differentiators.” The origins of the school reachback many centuries BCE. Its founder is considered to be Ka ̊›da, who wrotethe VaiŸe ̋ikasÒtra. The school’s system is a natural philosophy in the sense of apluralistic realism. Its name indicates the view that diversity and not unity is atthe heart of the universe. As elaborated in PraŸastap›da’s Pad›rthadharma -sa ̇graha(sixth century CE, the main commentary on theVaiŸe ̋ikasÒtra), theclassic VaiŸe ̋ika system presents knowable objects in six categories: substance,796The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-05 6/30/09 9:39 AM Page 796"},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"quality, action, generality, particular, and inherence (later, a seventh—nega-tion—was added). The first category is classified as ninefold: self, time, mentalcognition, direction, space, earth, water, fire, and wind. All of these nine areconsidered to be ultimately existent. As for causation, it is maintained that theresult inheres in the material cause. The self is described as unconscious and per-manent. It exists in an all-pervading manner, since its qualities can be experi-enced. In its obscured state in sa ̇s›ra, it has nine temporary qualities, the mainone being consciousness. It is only through its possible association with con-sciousness that the self apprehends pleasure and suffering as its own experiences(pleasure and suffering are also considered material derivatives of the primal mat-ter) . Through studying the scriptures, reflecting on them, and meditating on thetrue nature of the self, the self is able to rid itself of its nine specific qualities. Insuch a liberation, it not only transcends the world but even ceases to be the sub-ject of any experience, even of itself. In addition, the school speaks of ÊŸvara asa permanent and omniscient creator-god who is also the author of the Vedas.However, unlike the Ved›nta, his existence is established through inference andnot through revelation. Vy›kara ̊a(Tib. brda sprod pa), “Grammarians.” They are sometimes countedas a separate school of thought. However, they were not really propagating a full-fledged philosophical system. As their name indicates, the Grammarians weremainly concerned with linguistics and philosophy of language. The famous gram-marian Bhart ̧hari (about 460–520 CE) said that words are the fundamentalground of all things. Based on this view, it was especially the Grammarians’ the-ories on the actual referents of words, on the connection between generalitiesand their instances, and on the related epistemological issues that influencedmany of the other schools of thought. Heterodox Schools That Reject the Vedasfijıvika(Tib. kun tu ‘tsho ba), “those who follow special rules with regard tolivelihood.” At the time of the Buddha, this school of wandering mendicants wasled by Maskarı GoŸ›lıputra, one of the six great non-Buddhist teachers of histime (he died in 501 BCE). First, he was a companion of Vardham›na before thelatter became the founder of Jainism. After they separated, GoŸ›lıputra joined thefijıvikas and eventually became their supreme head. The main doctrine of thisschool is a strict determinism. All beings are merely subject to their fixed destiniesthat make them experience various kinds of happiness and suffering. There is noroom for karma and its results or salvific activity. For many eons, all beings—whether they are learned or fools—have to go through an individually set num-ber of rebirths in the six realms of cyclic existence before they finally attainAppendix 2: Non-Buddhist Indian Schools797Center Sunlit-05 6/30/09 9:39 AM Page 797"},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"liberation. The more theoretical considerations in the teachings of GoŸ›lıputrabelong to the same philosophical stream as Jainism.Jaina(Tib. rgyal ba pa), “Followers of the Victor.” Its founder was Vardham›na(born 557 BCE), called Nirgrantho Jñ›taputra. He is better known as Mah›vıra(“Great Hero”) and Jina (“Victor”), a name indicating someone who is victori-ous over the passions and has obtained mastery over the soul. In terms of histeachings, he is considered the last in a long row of gurus, called Tırthakaras. InBuddhist texts, Jainists are often called Nirgrantha (literally “Those Free fromBondage,” also interpreted as “The Nudes”). Originally, this name referred to thefollowers of P›rŸva (eighth century BCE), in whose very ascetic tradition Jinagrew up and which he continued, finally—like his parents—fasting to death (485BCE). Within Jainism, the yogic practitioners who are wandering ascetics, smear-ing their bodies with ashes and walking about completely naked, are calledDigambaras (“Sky-Clad Ones”). All other followers are named ⁄vet›mbaras(“White-Clad Ones”). The scriptural canon of Jainism—which includes theteachings of Mah›vıra—is vast but only transmitted by the latter group. Jainismstands somewhat between Buddhism and the Vedic schools. On the one hand,it rejects the authority of the Vedas and does not assert a supreme god. On theother hand, it believes in permanent souls1856and permanent matter. An infinitenumber of individual souls exist even in the smallest atoms of matter, which alsoexplains the strict emphasis on complete nonviolence (Skt. ahi ̇s›). The soul isthe experiencer and agent. In itself, it is perfect as infinite intelligence, bliss, andpower. However, the karma of physical, verbal, and mental activities—which isregarded as very subtle matter—infiltrates the soul and “weighs it down” to itsunion with a physical body in the gross material world of sa ̇s›ra, which obscuresits intrinsic qualities. Through various means, mainly meditative absorptions andascetic practices, the soul may eventually be completely liberated from karma. Atthis point, it ascends to the highest point of space in the universe, where it thendwells in eternal bliss.Lok›yata(Tib. ‘jig rten rgyang ‘phen pa), “MundanelyMinded;” also known asN›stika (Tib. med pa pa, Nihilists) or C›rv›kas (Tib. tshu rol mdzes pa pa,Hedonists/Materialists). Some say that the latter name comes from one of themain proponents of this school. It may also derive from c›ruv›ka, meaning“sweet-talker,” since the Lok›yatas so eloquently advocate the mere concern withthe pleasures of this life. The origins of this school are not clear, but it certainlywas one of the oldest in India. None of its scriptures, however, have survived. Itpropounds a kind of materialistic hedonism that denies the existence of an eter-nal soul (›tman), causes and results that are not directly visible, as well as formerand later lives. The body is said to be composed of the four elements, and mind798The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-05 6/30/09 9:39 AM Page 798"},{"pageNumber":800,"pageContent":"to be just an epiphenomenon of matter. The only kind of valid cognition is senseperception, while inference is denied altogether. Its followers deny any conse-quences of one’s actions. For them, there is no harm in killing or stealing and nomerit in any spiritual practice either (thus their rejection of the Vedas). Conse-quently, they deny all moral values and emphasize enjoyment of the pleasures ofthis life. It is no wonder that such views were always closely connected to polit-ical philosophy—which was systematically developed in ancient India veryearly—and were strongly supported by the more ruthless rulers. In an attempt tobase its teachings on scriptural authority, the school claims that its origins liewith B ̧haspati, the accomplished guru of the gods and mythological founder ofthe philosophy of state. He is said to have composed the B ̧haspatisÒtrathat waslater propagated on earth by V›lmıki. Prominent materialists at the time of Bud-dha ⁄›kyamuni were PÒra ̊a K›Ÿyapa, Ajita KeŸakambala, and KakudaK›ty›yana.Appendix 2: Non-Buddhist Indian Schools799Center Sunlit-05 6/30/09 9:39 AM Page

We have two studies on Mipham Rin-poche’s (1846–1912) presentation of Pr›saºgika-M›dhyamika by Williams (1998b) and Pettit(1999) as well as a translation of his commentary on Candrakırti’s Madhyamak›vat›ra(Pad-makara 2002). Some positions of Sakya masters are known through Sato (1983), Jackson (1994),Dreyfus (1997), ⁄›kya mchog ldan (2000), and especially through Della Santina’s (1986a)detailed study of an early Tibetan outline of Madhyamaka by the Sakya master Sönam Senge(Tib. bsod nams seng ge, 1429–1490). Ruegg (2000) presents various Tibetan positions onwhether Centrists have a thesis or not. Finally, there is a series of papers on the Sv›tantrika-Pr›saºgika distinction in Dreyfus and McClintock 2003.3It is generally accepted by now that the terms “Autonomists” (Skt. *Sv›tantrika, Tib. rangrgyud pa; an asterisk before a Sanskrit word indicates that it is reconstructed from another lan-guage, usually Tibetan) and “Consequentialists” (Skt. *Pr›saºgika, Tib. thal ’gyur pa) areTibetan inventions that did not exist in India (this is also explicitly acknowledged by Tibetanmasters, such as Butön, Tsongkhapa, and ⁄›kya Chogden). Over the centuries, this distinc-tion has become the standard Tibetan subdivision of the Madhyamaka school. In manyTibetan doxographies, one finds extremely detailed elaborations of this distinction (logical,epistemological, and even ontological), which often entail a number of problems as well asquestionable hierarchies of philosophical systems. However, since most people who studyTibetan Buddhism in both the East and the West keep referring to these terms, for the sakeof following common consensus I will use them too, but only in a provisional way and withcertain clarifications to follow (for more details on the distinction between Autonomists andConsequentialists, see Chapter 3).4Of course, the Gelugpa tradition itself is not monolithic in terms of doctrinal issues. How-ever, especially with regard to Centrism, Tsongkhapa’s positions are for the most part strictlyfollowed and never questioned. From this perspective, the Gelugpa school is the most univo-cal among the Tibetan traditions.5There are even a considerable number of Tibetan masters (both past and present) who denythat the Gelugpa version qualifies as Madhyamaka at all, let alone as Consequentialism.Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 853"},{"pageNumber":855,"pageContent":"6The topic has been touched on by Williams (1983) and Ruegg (1988).

Thurman (1997) elaborates:This is the most famous moment of the Scripture: Vimalakırti’s moment of silence on thesubject of non-duality, i.e., the ultimate. It is noteworthy, however, that Vimalakırti talksa great deal about the ultimate on many other occasions; his silence here is given its spe-cial impact by the series of profound statements preceeding it, which culminate in thestatement of MañjuŸrı to the effect that silence is itself the best explanation of non-dual-ity. Hence all silence is not to be exaggeratedly taken as the profoundest teaching, but onlysuch a silence in the special context of profound thought on the ultimate. For example,the silences of the disciples in Chap. III, as they became speechless when confronted bythe eloquent criticism of Vimalakırti, are not taken to be profound; nor is the silence of⁄›riputra when questioned by the goddess in Chap. 8 accepted as anything extraordinary.Candrakırti, in his Prasannapad›(p. 57, I.7–8), has this to say in regard to the ques-tion as to whether the Enlightened Ones employ logical arguments or not: “Who can sayif the Holy Ones (employ logical arguments) or not? The ultimate is inherent (even) inthe ‘Keeping Silent of the Holy Ones.’ What then would cause us to imagine whether856The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 856"},{"pageNumber":858,"pageContent":"they employ logical arguments or do not employ logical arguments?” It is important tonote that equating the ultimate with the “Keeping Silent of the Holy Ones” in no wayprecludes the ultimacy of their speech. As the Goddess says to ⁄›riputra (p. 59): “ . . . donot point to liberation by abandoning speech! Why? The holy liberation is the equalityof all things!”Thus, to imitate the Scripture’s pattern of expression: “Silence” and “speech” are dual-istic. Just as speech is ultimately meaningless, so silence exists only in contrast with speech.Penetration into the equality of silence and speech is the entrance.

Thisterm covers the entire range of the many-layered mental flux of setting up and relating to ref-erence points, in terms of both subject and object. In this sense, “discursiveness” represents thesubjective side of this process, while “reference points” are its objective aspect. (Thus, accord-ing to the context, I will use either one or both of these terms.) Discursiveness and referencepoints are found in ordinary sentient beings and to a lesser degree in noble ones who do notrest in meditative equipoise. Discursiveness ranges from coarse thoughts down to even themost subtle dualistic tendencies of a separate perceiver and perceived. For example, these ten-dencies manifest in such a way that it still appears to the senses as if there were objects out therethat are perceived by a mind different from them, even when it is realized that there are noouter objects different from mind and no really existing mind either.

In India, this school was also called Vijñaptiv›da (Tib. rnam rigsmra ba). Its proponents are also called Yog›c›ra(s), while the presently popular Sanskritiza-tion “Yog›c›rin” is not used in Indian texts. Tibetans usually refer to this school as “Mere Men-talism” (Tib. sems tsam, mostly translated as “Mind Only”). However, in India, thecorresponding term cittam›trawas not used as a name for this school but only for one of itskey concepts. Likewise, the followers of this school were not called “Mere Mentalists” (Tib.sems tsam pa), since neither the popular (but wrong) Sanskritization “Cittam›trin” nor themore probable term “Caittam›trika” appears in any Indian texts.

About the use of the term “identitylessness” and other details, see the sectionin chapter 2 entitled “The Two Types of Identitylessness.”86This is clearly expressed in all Centrist reasonings, since they always negate all theoreticalpossibilities in relation to phenomena through the structure of the fourfold logical approachknown as the tetralemma: For example, it is refuted that something is existent, nonexistent,both, or neither.87See, for example, the Dhammacakkapavattanasutta(the first teaching that the Buddha gavein the Deer Park at Sarnath).88Verses 51, 58–59.89VI.118.90For an elaboration on this knowledge and its relation to wisdom (Skt. jñ›na, Tib. ye shes),see the section in chapter 2 entitled “From Knowledge to Wisdom.”91These teachings on the subjective aspect of prajñ›p›ramit› are called “the hidden meaningof the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras,” which are systematically elucidated in Maitreya’s Ornament ofClear Realizationand its many commentaries. In all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism, theyare studied even more extensively than the Madhyamaka teachings, which mainly emphasizethe objective aspect of the prajñ›p›ramit› teachings, i.e., emptiness.

Thus, when I use the term “reification,” it refers to the tendency to solidify ourexperiences and the world around us, to operate with the resulting “solid things,” and to clingto them as being real.93Skt. LalitavistarasÒtra, Tib. rgya cher rol pa’i mdo, XXV.1 (P783, p. 238.5.6).94It should be clear that this does not mean simply to take the nature of the mind as the finalreference point.

Many people think that Centrism is concerned only with empti-ness and that wisdom is dealt with only by the Yog›c›ra or Shentong tradition. However, inCandrakırti’s texts (especially his autocommentary onThe Entrance into Centrism), he indeeddeals with the exegesis of wisdom too. He definitely does not treat it as a non-Centrist sub-ject. For example, he describes the Dharma Body as “the body whose nature is wisdom”(@331B). (The same is true of the Yog›c›ras’ treatment of emptiness.)105Verses 9–12ab. This text is listed under Candrakırti’s (6th/7th century) works in theTengyurand appears as an appendix to his autocommentary onThe Entrance into Centrism. Itscolophon says that it is authored by the great master Candrakırti, but also that it was trans-lated into Tibetan by the author himself and the translator ’Gos khug pa lha btsas, who livedin the eleventh century. There was an eleventh-century master by the name Candrakırti(Tibetan tradition calls him “the lesser Candrakırti”) who was a disciple of Jet›ri (10th/11th cen-tury), one of the teachers of AtıŸa.106Mi bskyod rdo rje 1996, p. 27.107Dpa’ bo gtsug lag phreng ba, n.d., p. 874.Endnotes 859Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 859"},{"pageNumber":861,"pageContent":"108There are different interpretations as to the meaning of the term “dharmas” here. Someschools say that it refers to all phenomena of cyclic existence and nirv› ̊a. Others take it tomean the enlightened qualities of Buddhahood that are intrinsic to the nature of mind orBuddha nature and thus describe this expanse as the source of all qualities of the noble ones.109Often a threefold division of awareness is presented:(1) awareness of something other (mind being aware of something other than itself, suchas outer objects)(2) self-awareness (mind being aware of itself)(3) awareness of the lack of nature.“Awareness of the lack of nature” means to directly realize the true nature of all phenomena,i.e., that they are without nature. Such realization occurs from the path of seeing onward andis also called “the wisdom that realizes identitylessness,” “yogic valid perception,” or “person-ally experienced wisdom.” The latter term emphasizes that this wisdom is a unique, immedi-ate, and alive experience, not just some imagined idea of something of which one has heardor read. Mind realizing the nature of all phenomena includes mind being aware of its own ulti-mate nature, which is the unity of awareness and emptiness. Such realization is free from thetriad of something that is aware, something of which it is aware, and the act of being aware,while at the same time being a vivid and transformative experience in the noble ones’ ownminds (Skt. praty›tm›ryajñ›na, Tib. ’phags pa’i so so rang gi ye shes). It is in this sense thatmany Tibetan masters, such as the Seventh Karmapa, have explained this wisdom as the mostsublime expression of the principle that mind is able to be aware of itself in a nondual way, i.e.,free from subject and object. However, this is to be clearly distinguished from the ordinarynotion of self-awareness (2), which is that all beings are aware of their own direct experiences,such as being happy or sad.This difference is reflected in the Sanskrit words svasa ̇vedana(Tib. rang rig; self-awareness)and praty›tmavid (so so rang rig; personal experience) and its derivatives, such aspraty›tmavedanıya. More literally, praty›tmavedanıyajñ›na(Tib. so so rang rig pa’i ye shes)means “the wisdom of what is to be personally experienced (i.e., the true nature of phenom-ena).” (In themselves, the corresponding Tibetan expressions rang rigand so so rang rigdo notmirror this distinction.)In the Tibetan tradition, the meaning of so soin so so rang rig pa’i ye shesis explained in twoways. First, it refers to the fact that the final, immediate realization of the nature of our mindcan only be accomplished by our mind’s wisdom itself and not by anything extrinsic to it, suchas the teacher’s instructions or blessings. In other words, the only way to really personallyknowwhat a Buddha’s or bodhisattva’s wisdom is like is to experience it in our own mind. Inthis sense, such wisdom is truly inconceivable and incommunicable, which is part of what theterm “personally experienced wisdom” indicates, since it is one’s very own “private” experienceunshared with others. (In this context, it should be clear that “personal” or “private” does notrefer to an individual person, since the wisdom of the noble ones encompasses the very real-ization that there is no such person or self. Nevertheless, it is an experience that occurs onlyin certain distinct mind streams that have been trained and not in others.) The second expla-nation of so sois that, just like a mirror, this wisdom clearly sees all phenomena in a distinctway without mixing them up.110Dpa’ bo gtsug lag phreng ba, n.d., p. 647.111Ibid., pp. 833–34.112Ibid., pp. 831–32.113In this respect, Mikyö Dorje’s efforts here are very similar to Mipham Rinpoche’s demon-stration in his Lamp of Certainty(Tib. nges shes sgron me) three hundred years later that the860The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 860"},{"pageNumber":862,"pageContent":"view of Consequentialism is in full accord with and essential for the teachings on Mah›sandhi(Tib. rdzogs chen).114Sa ̇yutta Nik›yaII.17ff., specifically:“That entities have existence, O Kacc›na, is one extreme.

This classification seems tohave first appeared in the works of Bh›vaviveka and is later used in Bodhibhadra’sJñ›nas›rasamucchayanibandhana(P5252), Mok ̋›karagupta’s Tarkabh› ̋› (P5762), Maitrıpa’sTattvaratnav›li (P3085; which, however, includes the SÒtra Followers in the great vehicle),and Sahajavajra’s Sthitasamucchaya(P3071). The names of the four schools are also found inthe texts of Candrakırti, ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, and KamalaŸıla. In Tibet, this fourfold classificationalready appears in the ninth-century Sanskrit-Tibetan dictionary Mah›vyutpatti(Tib. bye bragtu rtogs par byed pa chen po) and became the standard doxographical classification of Bud-dhist philosophical systems. However, this set of four schools should be understood more asa pedagogical summary of the many strands and views of Buddhist schools in India. For exam-ple, what is called the Vaibh› ̋ika school here actually refers to at least eighteen schools thatmoreover never thought of themselves as belonging to a single main school. Strictly speaking,“Vaibh› ̋ikas” are only those among these schools who follow the Mah›vibh› ̋›, a huge com-pendium on Abhidharma that was compiled by several arhats. As for the SÒtra Followers,from all that we know, there seem to have been only a handful of them (making the notion ofa distinct school questionable), and none of their original texts have survived.138When these two masters are called Autonomists, it is only in retrospect and just refers totheir approach of formulating Centrist reasonings. As for the contents of their system, theypropagated a synthesis of Yog›c›ra and Madhyamaka that is quite different from, for exam-ple, Bh›vaviveka’s presentation of Centrism. Therefore, it is not unproblematic to call all thesemasters Autonomists. (For more details, see Chapter 3.)139For example, during the early ninth century, N›g›rjuna’s MÒlamadhyamakak›rik›wasalready translated (later revised by Kanakavarman, Mah›sumati, and Patsab Lots›wa) as wellas Buddhap›lita’s and Bh›vaviveka’s commentaries on this text. There were also translationsof N›g›rjuna’s Yukti ̋a ̋ ̨ik›, ⁄Ònyat›saptati, Vigrahavy›vartanı, and Ratn›valı, along with Can-drakırti’s commentaries on the first two of these texts. Of course, the early translations includedthe texts by ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, KamalaŸıla, and Jñ›nagarbha. ⁄›ntideva’s Bodhicary›vat›raalso wastranslated at that time.

One tra-ditional account has it that N›g›rjuna had a life span of six hundred years, and Candrakırti isthen often presented as his direct disciple. The Eighth Karmapa quotes another version froman old manuscript about the history of the four transmission lineages of the Kagyüs that Marpabrought to Tibet. This text reports a prophecy by many ̃›ki ̊ıs right after the passing-awayof N›g›rjuna that he would be reborn as Candrakırti five hundred years later. (Western schol-arship assumes instead that there were two N›g›rjunas, an earlier one and a later one.)

S›k›ra -v›din/Saty›k›rav›din, Tib. rnam bcas pa/rnam bden pa), are those who assert that mind appre-hends its objects via a mental aspect of the object that appears to consciousness. BuddhistAspectarians are the SÒtra Followers and certain Yog›c›ras. Non-Aspectarians (Skt.Nir›k›rav›din, Tib. rnam med pa) are those who deny that there is such an aspect. BuddhistNon-Aspectarians are the Followers of the Great Exposition and certain Yog›c›ras who do notdeny the mere appearance but the actual reality of such a mental, objective aspect (“FalseAspectarians,” Skt. Alık›k›rav›din, Tib. rnam brdzun pa). In Tibet, these two kinds ofYog›c›ras are called “Real Aspectarian Mere Mentalists” (Tib. sems tsam rnam bden pa) and“False Aspectarian Mere Mentalists” (Tib. sems tsam rnam brdzun pa), because they eitherassert or deny that the objective aspect that appears to consciousness is really existent as mind.Specifically, in his commentary, Sahajavajra identifies all the above schools as well as thoseCentrists whom he regards as asserting or denying aspects (Skt. S›k›ram› dhyamika/ Nir› -k›ram›dhyamika, Tib. rnam bcas dbu ma pa/rnam med dbu ma pa) as the persons who do notrealize true reality.162In this context, it is interesting that the early Gelugpa scholar Sera Jetsünba Chökyi Gyalt-sen (Tib. se ra rje btsun pa chos kyi rgyal mtshan, 1469–1546) has also affirmed that Maitrıpa,Marpa, and Milarepa are in accord with Candrakırti (Gsung lan klu sgrub dgongs rgyan.New Delhi: Champa Chogyal, 1969, fols. 20b.3ff.). Also the later Gelugpa master JanggyaRölpay Dorje (Tib. lcang skya rol pa’i rdo rje, 1717–1786) in his Presentation of PhilosophicalSystems(Tib. grub pa’i mtha’i rnam par bzhag pa) says the same, using the above quote fromMaitrıpa and explicitly adding N›ropa (see Lopez 1987, pp. 264–66).163Skt. *Alık›k›ra-Cittam›tra-Madhyamaka, Tib. sems tsam rnam rdzun gyi dbu ma (for themeaning and translation of the term “Mere Mentalism,” see Chapter 4).

This view has been widely represented in India and Tibet by master Vajrap› ̊i(born 1017), Asu from Nepal, Kor Nirupa (1062–1162), and others. The Blue Annals(pp.855–60) says that “the upper tradition of Mah›mudr›” (Tib. phyag chen stod lugs) comesfrom this Vajrap› ̊i, who was a direct disciple of Maitrıpa.

As for its etymology,The Treasury of Knowledgequotes Ajitamitra’s Commentary on the Instructions for the King:“The Body of Dharmat› is the Dharma Body. It is [called] ‘body’ for the following reasons:Since it is the ‘body’ of all dharmas, it does not go beyond the nature of the suchness of allbeings. It is the support for all mundane and supramundane qualities.”Thus, in general, the word dharmain this term is understood to refer to all phenomena, tothe nature of phenomena (Skt. dharmat›, Tib. chos nyid) or to the infinite and excellent qual-ities of enlightenment. Thus, The Treasury of Knowledgedefines the Dharma Body as follows:“It is the very expanse of dharmas that is completely pure by nature and endowed with alluncontaminated qualities.

Each ofthese ten perfections correponds to one of the ten grounds of bodhisattvas and represents themain practice on its respective ground.263This term is usually translated as “postmeditation,” which at best seems to be too neutrala word and has the connotation of just taking a break. Subsequent attainment refers to the levelof realization of emptiness that is attained as a result of having rested in meditative equipoise.Subsequent to rising from such equipoise, the realization of emptiness that has been gainedwhile resting in it informs and enhances the seeing of the illusionlike nature of all appearancesand experiences while practicing the six perfections during the time between the formal ses-sions of meditative equipoise.

There is usually a wide range of translations of this term (suchas “cataract” or “ophthalmia”). Judging by the symptoms of this visual impairment that aredescribed in Tibetan texts, it must primarily refer to what—in Western terms—is called“floaters” or “mouches volantes.” These are congealed proteins in the gel of the vitreous bodyof the eye that appear as floating, out-of-focus threads in the visual field. They are set intomotion through eye movements, and when the eyes are kept still, they pass through one’svisual field or sink down slowly, which can give the impression of slowly sinking hairs or a hair-net (Skt. keŸa/keŸo ̊ ̃uka, Tib. skra shad). Sometimes they also appear as little dark dots. Suchappearances can also just show as hazy spots in the visual field etc. They usually increase withage and can be seen best against bright backgrounds. All of this is not really considered as a dis-ease in the West, since—to a varying degree—the same process happens in everybody’s eyes.Some Tibetan texts mention also the symptom of double vision—such as seeing two moons—which can be a symptom of cataracts (degeneration of the eye-lens). Double vision does notappear though due to the above changes in the vitreous body, whereas patients with cataractsdo not report “floating hairs” or the like. However, the analogy of the example that is givenhere—the scalpel that removes a membrane—would typically refer to operating on cataracts(the changes in the vitreous body cannot be operated on). Thus, one could describe “rab rib”as a general term for “blurred vision” due to turbidities in the eyes, be it in the vitreous bodyor the lens.274ACIP TD3860@13A.275Ibid., @14A276Lines 35ab.277Verse 4.278Sa ̇yutta Nik›yaXXII, 94 (quote abbreviated).279IX.3–4ab.280 Lit. “proponents of really existing entities.”281For further explanations of the terms “nominal ultimate” and “nonnominal ultimate,” seethe section below entitled “Dividing Space: Divisions of the Ultimate.”282ACIP TD3860@163B.283ACIP TD3856@56B.284In light of the above meanings of the term sa ̇v ̧ti, to translate it as “relative” seems fartoo vague and neutral.

For example, impermanent phenomena and phenomena that arisefrom causes and conditions are not different in nature, since all impermanent phenomenaarise from causes and conditions, and all phenomena that arise from causes and conditions areimpermanent. However, when we think “impermanent phenomena,” a different mental imageor notion comes to mind than when we think “phenomena that arise from causes and condi-tions.” It is said that we select the specific notion of “impermanent phenomena” through theconceptual exclusion of everything that is not an impermanent phenomenon. In this way, acertain notion is isolated from all other notions, and this is why it is called an isolate.308Quoted in Mi bskyod rdo rje 1996, pp. 256–57.872The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 872"},{"pageNumber":874,"pageContent":"309Ibid., p. 258.310Skt.

In general, the term “engagement throughdevoted interest” stands for the level of bodhisattva practice on the two paths of accumulationand junction. Since the nature of phenomena has not been seen directly, one engages in thepath with a conceptual mind motivated by the devoted interest to see this nature.

They arelocated in, but are distinct from, the gross physical sense organs, such as the eyeballs.388Haribhadra’s Illumination of The Ornament of Clear Realizationgives a similar explana-tion: “Also the emptiness of the primordial nature of the wisdom that focuses on the empti-ness of the internal and so on through the emptiness of all phenomena is emptiness. Therefore,it is the emptiness of emptiness. The mere wisdom that all phenomena are emptiness is theemptiness of all phenomena. Also this [fourth emptiness] here teaches emptiness, because itrelinquishes conceptions that cling to [this wisdom] as such.” (P5192, fol. 69b.5–7)389This is a term for Buddha nature.390This does not mean that hearers and solitary realizers also meditate on the four emptinessesof the conditioned phenomena of the path, the unconditioned phenomena of nirv› ̊a, themiddle way, and cyclic existence. However, they engage in the path, attain nirv› ̊a, practicethe middle way free from the extremes of ascetism and indulgence, and relinquish cyclic exis-tence. On the other hand, they do not engage in dedications and so on in order to render allthat is positive inexhaustible. They also do not deal with Buddha nature, a Buddha’s major andminor marks, or the Buddha qualities.391The terms “imaginary form” (Skt. parikalpitarÒpa, Tib. kun tu brtags pa’i gzugs), “con-ceived form” (Skt. vikalpitarÒpa, Tib. rnam par brtags pa’i gzugs), and “perfect form” (Skt.parini ̋pannarÒpa, yongs su grub pa’i gzugs), or “form in terms of the nature of phenomena”(Skt. dharmat›rÒpa, Tib. chos nyid kyi gzugs) appear quite frequently in the Prajñ›p›ramit›sÒtras, most prominently in the chapter of Maitreya in The Prajñ›p›ramit› SÒtra in Twenty-five Thousand Lines. These terms can be equated with the three natures: the imaginary nature,the other-dependent nature, and the perfect nature respectively.876The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 876"},{"pageNumber":878,"pageContent":"392In addition, in the eighth chapter of The SÒtra That Unravels the Intention(The Questionsof Maitreya), the Buddha describes how these sixteen emptinesses serve to eliminate the dif-ferent kinds of clinging to the various signs of realizing suchness.393In the presentation of sixteen emptinesses, the emptiness of emptiness (A4) switches placeswith the emptiness of the great (A5), while the emptiness of specifically characterized phe-nomena (A13) does the same with the emptiness of all phenomena (A14). The emptiness ofnonentities (A17/B15) and the emptiness of the nature of nonentities (A18/B16) are also foundin different places.394Obviously, this does not mean that Buddha nature is something that can be pinned downas having some intrinsic nonempty nature of its own.395Compare, for example, with Latin animaand German Atem.396ACIP TD3865@190B.397When it is clear from the context that the single term ›tmanindeed isof a personal nature,for the sake of convenience, I still mostly use the word “self.”398Often translated as “the views about the transitory collection.” For an explanation of thisterm, see the section below entitled “Personal Identitylessness.”399VI.44.400Actually, personal identitylessness is just an instance of phenomenal identitylessness.

For the differ-ences, see the comparison of the formats of these two inferences with the well-known three-part Aristotelian syllogism below.445In this limited context, I deliberately do not touch upon the many technicalities, such asspecific terms, logical fallacies, and the issues of deduction and induction, that are related tothe presentation of the three modes. Rather, I choose a simplified description in terms of settheory in order to facilitate a basic understanding of Centrist reasonings. Thus, instead ofspeaking of logical “entailment” (Skt. vy›pti, Tib. khyab pa), I explain the three modes herein terms of “inclusion” of one set in another. (May great logicians bear with me!) If one lacksa basic understanding of the three modes, the intricacies of Centrist reasonings are very oftendifficult to penetrate. Readers who wish to go into detail may refer to the vast specific litera-ture on Buddhist reasoning and logic. See, for example, Dreyfus 1997 and Perdue 1993.446This is also called a formal probative argument (Skt. prayogav›kya, Tib. sbyor ba’i ngag).447Compare the above two formats of reasoning with the classical Aristotelian syllogism:All men are mortal.Socrates is a man.Therefore, Socrates is mortal.The format of the inference for others is not to be confused with the classical five-memberedIndian probative argument developed by the non-Buddhist school of the Logicians (see chap-ter 3).448Skt. ad ̧Ÿy›nupalabdhihetu, Tib. mi snang ma dmigs pa’i gtan tshigs.449Skt. d ̧Ÿy›nupalabdhihetu, Tib. snang rung ma dmigs pa’i gtan tshigs.450Skt. sa ̇bhandh›nupalabdhihetu, Tib. ’brel zla ma dmigs pa’i gtan tshigs.451For example, in “At this restaurant, there is no elephant,” what is to be negated is that thereisan elephant at the restaurant.

For this,see also the explanation of the last part of the vajra sliver reasoning that negates arising with-out any cause in the section below entitled “The Five Great Madhyamaka Reasonings.”456Western science refers to this and many other kinds of behavior as “instinct,” which is avery convenient category to subsume any behavior that is inexplicable through learning orother conditions in this life, without, however, explaining much. In Buddhism, “instinct” isexplained as the ripening of habitual tendencies from past lifetimes.457In addition, it does not deny the existence of heaven in the first place.458Space is defined as the mere absence of anything that has the capacity to obstruct.459The four extremes are existence, nonexistence, both, and neither.

For example, we may give rise to the mentalimage “chair” upon seeing the shape and color of what we consider a chair. Such an image mayalso appear in our mind when reading the word “chair” in a book or hearing it from someoneelse.476In Buddhism, the term “substance” can refer to either material or mental substance.477I.3ab and VI.120.478Verses 10, 13b–d, 14.880The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 880"},{"pageNumber":882,"pageContent":"479Verses 31–33 (Unless otherwise indicated, all subsequent quotations in this section arefrom this text.)480ACIP TD3832@129A–129B.481This is a summary of verses 40–51.

Usually, mainly verse29 on “no thesis” is quoted and then interpreted as just referring to Centrists’ having no“autonomous or really existing thesis” (Tsongkhapa’s Essence of Good Explanationsquotes verse41 on valid cognition not being established through itself but interprets it as just refuting self-aware consciousness; see Thurman 1989, p. 321).482Verses 1–2, 17–19.483Verse 24.484Ruegg (2002) quotes The SÒtra of the Arrival in Laºkato the same effect: “that the state-ment ‘all entities/dharmas are unoriginated’ should not be made a thesis (pratijñ›) because thedeconstruction of the thesis thus ensues (pratijñ›h›ni ̄ prasajyate).” (p. 113).485Verse 23.486IX.138–140.487VI.175.488Verses 26, 61–62.489ACIP TD3832@127B–128A.490Verses 63–64.491ACIP TD3832@135A–135B.492To be sure, in terms of ethics, conduct, karmic causes and results, and such on the levelof seeming reality, their words are clearly not noncommittal.493IX.109–110.494XXIV.11.

Thus, the third mode—the absence of the reason in the heterologous set—does nothave a basis to be established. Nevertheless, as formulated above, if there weresomething reallyexistent, it would have to exist as either one or many. Thus, this is not considered a flaw in suchreasonings. 583I.1.584The latter are mainly the texts of Dign›ga and Dharmakırti and their commentaries.585Easy to remember: Buddhap›lita’s commentary bears the same name as its author (ACIPTD3842@161B).586In particular, the position of arising from something other has traditionally been connectedwith the Logicians (›rambhav›da) and certain fibhidh›rmikas.587These are the causal condition, the object condition, the dominant condition, and theimmediate condition. Chapter I of The Fundamental Versesexplains in detail that things in gen-eral do not really arise from these four conditions.588VI.14.589This obviously does not refer to certain findings of modern physics where the result is saidto precede the cause, but to our ordinary experience of the relation between cause and effect.590This refers to the third of the five Centrist reasonings—the negation of an arising of exis-tents and nonexistents—which is explained below.591ACIP TD3860@011B.592I.3cd.593Ibid., I.2–3ab.594Ibid., I.4.595Ibid., I.5–6.596Ibid., I.7.597Ibid., I.9.598ACIP TD3860@013A.599I.11–12.600Ibid., I.13–14.601The following is a rather simplified description of the more complex position (nayav›da)of the Jainas.602ACIP TD3860@012A.603Ibid., @012A–012B.

This shows that the modern idea of mind as an epiphenomenon is not really so new.605This refers to a story from ancient India that illustrates that there is often much ado aboutnothing: In the dusty roads of a town, a man produced some fake footprints that looked likethose of a wolf and then proclaimed everywhere that there was a dangerous wolf in town, thusterrifying everybody.606See the section above entitled “Reasons and Negations.”607This is just a very brief sketch of some major arguments for the existence of past andfuture lives and for matter or the body not being the cause for the mind. Buddhist texts pres-ent detailed explanations of many more reasons that relate to these issues. Obviously, the lat-ter topic corresponds to the current popular scientific claim that mind is just anepiphenomenon of the body or matter in general. However, from the Centrist point of view,since all these questions of other lifetimes and the body-mind issue only pertain to seeming real-ity, they are not dealt with in the context of the five great Centrist reasonings. These reason-ings exclusively pertain to the ultimate nonexistence of body, mind, and other lifetimes.Obviously, the function of such reasonings is not to give reasons for the real existence of any-thing, nor to address the question of whether body and mind have a causal relationship. Hence,this is not the place to elaborate on these issues, which are greatly disputed in both the Eastand the West. For their detailed presentation, see the chapter of Dharmakırti’s Commentaryon Valid Cognitionthat establishes the Buddha as the ultimate source of valid cognition (trans-lated in R. Jackson 1993).608VI.32.609The name of this school comes from its main scripture, called The Great Detailed Expo-sition(Skt. Mah›vibh› ̋a, Tib. bye brag tu bshad pa chen mo). The school asserts that allthings in the three times exist as distinct, substantial entities right now. Thus, it proposes a kindof backwards chronology of cause and result: All things that are to come already exist in a sub-stantial way in the future. They just transit into the present, while those things that exist in thepresent pass into the past, all of them maintaining their substantial existence throughout thisprocess.610VII.17.611Ibid., VII.19cd.612ACIP TD3882@07A–09A.613I.48.614Of course, about these causes and conditions, Centrists say neither that they really existnor that they are the same as or other than their results.615XXIV.18–19.616Skt. gandharva, Tib. dri za.

This is a very detaileddescription as to how various imputed features of a hypothetical self are contradictory to thefeatures of the aggregates and such. (1) The competence in knowing the aggregates serves as theremedy for regarding the self as something singular, since it is the nature of the aggregates tocontain a great variety of many things. (2) The competence in the eighteen constituents is theremedy for regarding the self as a cause, since the constituents exhaustively contain all possi-ble causes. (3) The competence in the twelve sources serves as the remedy for thinking that theself is the experiencer, since all objects are experienced through the interdependence of thetwelve sources. (4) The competence in interdependence serves as the remedy for seeing the selfas a creator, because things are not created by a self but originate in dependence on variouscauses and conditions. (5) The competence in what is the case and what is not the case servesas the remedy for thinking that the self wields some power, since the self has no power overthings, which are solely under the power of specific causes and results. (6) The competence inthe faculties serves as the remedy for regarding the self as a ruler, since there are only thetwenty-two faculties that dominate all things. (7) The competence in time serves as the rem-Endnotes 887Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 887"},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"edy for holding the self to be permanent, since arising and ceasing happen within the contextof the three times. (8) The competence in the four realities of the noble ones functions as theremedy for assuming the self as the matrix or support for afflicted phenomena and purified phe-nomena, because the first two realities are the matrix of afflicted phenomena and the latter twoare the matrix of purified phenomena. (9) The competence in the vehicles serves as the rem-edy for the belief that the self is that which practices yoga, since the qualities of the respectivevehicles appear only through the consciousnesses that cultivate them.

Thus, AtıŸa’s identification of Kambala’s Centrist texts asbelonging to the model texts of Centrism is remarkable and further supports the impressionthat the demarcation lines of different Buddhist “schools” in India were not as hard and fastas many later Tibetan authors assumed.735He wrote a now lost commentary on The Fundamental Verses.736P5325, fols. 126a.5–126b.2.737Verse 15.738Verses 2–3.739ACIP TD3948@282B.

However, the publisher’s foreword to Rendawa’s commentary statesthe Sakyapa stance on this as follows: “The division into Autonomists and Consequentialistsis not made through the view of the ultimate, but they are divided through the way of for-mulating reasonings that serve as means of proof. There is no difference in their view, sinceboth are fully qualified Centrists” (p. ga).

Prajñ›karamati’s Bodhic›ry›vat›rapañjik›on verses VI.23, 25, and28–29 also refers to him. Apart from AtıŸa’s mere mentioning of Candrakırti as stated above,he quotes verse VI.80 of the latter’s Entrance into Centrismas verse 19 of his Entrance into theTwo Realities. Not without irony, apart from Jay›nanda’s commentary, the text that mostfavorably mentions Candrakırti quite often (and quotes him six times) is Bh›vaviveka’s JewelLamp of Centrism(for details, see Lindtner 1982b).Jñ›nagarbha refutes some opponents who say that, if entities do not arise in actuality, justlike the child of a barren woman, they do not even arise on the level of the seeming (ten stan-zas of refutation in his autocommentary on verse 25 of his Distinction between the Two Reali-ties). Some modern scholars (Eckel, Lindtner, Ruegg) regard this as probably being directedagainst Candrakırti’s understanding of seeming reality as presented in his Entrance into Cen-trismVI.36–38. There, however, Candrakırti uses the example of a reflection for seeming phe-nomena and says that empty entities such as reflections doarise from other empty entities.More important, in verses VI.108–113 and their autocommentary (ACIP TD3862@ 288A–290B), Candrakırti himself extensively refutes precisely the above position of Jñ›nagarbha’sopponents, explaining why the phenomena of seeming reality are not like the child of a bar-ren woman. Ultimately, both such phenomena and the child of a barren woman are empty andEndnotes 895Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 895"},{"pageNumber":897,"pageContent":"do not arise, but from the perspective of ordinary beings, the former—including dreams andillusions—appear due to certain equally illusory conditions, while the latter never does. Asexplained before, in his works, Candrakırti repeatedly objects to plain nihilism.796The colophon of this commentary says that it was not even written in India but duringJay›nanda’s stay in the borderlands between Tibet and China near MañjuŸrı’s five-peakedmountain (Chin. Wu-t’ai-shan).797All of this is also highlighted by the fact that both the major Tibetan historians T›ran›tha(1980, pp. 198–99) and Butön (1931, vol, II, pp. 134–35) in their historical works dedicate lessthan one page to Candrakırti, saying only that he followed Buddhap›lita and not even men-tioning Candrakırti’s critique of Bh›vaviveka. T›ran›tha also writes very briefly on Bud-dhap›lita and Bh›vaviveka (pp. 186–87), but nowhere does he refer to theAutonomist-Consequentialist distinction. He states that Bh›vaviveka “composed a commen-tary refuting the views of the earlier ›c›rya-sas expressed in their expositions of the Madhya-makamÒla” and that, unlike Buddhap›lita, “because he had thousands of monks as hisfollowers, his views were more extensively spread.” In comparison, both Tibetan historianswrite at length about other Centrists such as N›g›rjuna, firyadeva, and ⁄›ntideva as well asYog›c›ras such as Asaºga, Vasubandhu, Dign›ga, and Dharmakırti.798Except for some additional considerations, quotations, and a few insertions from TheTreasury of Knowledge, the remaining sections of this chapter are for the most part (at timesabridged) paraphrases of Mikyö Dorje’s commentary (Mi bskyod rdo rje 1996, pp. 135–218).WARNING: If your resistance to Centrist reasoning has not sufficiently built up throughthe vaccination of the preceding chapters, the remaining parts of this chapter may prove haz-ardous to your sanity.799Tib. tshur mthong, lit. “those who see just this side.”800Also called circularity of argument or same predicament.801Skt. svatantrapratijñ›, Tib. rang rgyud kyi dam bca’.802ACIP TD3856@60A–B.803Verse 33.804Verses 33–34.805III.360, 209.806The most common Tibetan explanation of autonomous reasoning is that it entails thethree modes of a correct reason, which have to be established from their own side. This meansthat they are established through a valid cognition that operates through the power of entitiesand is acknowledged from the perspectives of both proponent and opponent. However, aswill be shown in detail below, this is obviously not the indigenous understanding ofautonomous reasonings by those very Indian masters who became designated as Autonomistslater (see also the essays of McClintock and Eckel in Dreyfus and McClintock 2003, pp. 125–71and 173–203).807As we saw, they do not consider such valid cognitions as part of their own Centrist sys-tem either.808VIII.104. The meaning of this verse is exactly the same as that of the famous verse IX.34of ⁄›ntideva’s Bodhicary›vat›ra:Once neither entities nor nonentitiesRemain before the mind,896The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 896"},{"pageNumber":898,"pageContent":"There is no other mental flux [either].Therefore, it is utter nonreferential peace.809Verses 9cd–11.810Lines 71ab.811Mikyö Dorje adds here that he has treated the above claims of three features of the validcognition of Autonomists together for the sake of simplicity. He clarifies that, by doing so, hedoes not mean to misrepresent the various positions of those who claim such features as say-ing that all Autonomists accept all three of these features, since some claim that there are alsoAutonomists who seem to just accept one or two.812In Buddhist texts, “verbal testimony” is usually called “scriptural authority” (Skt. ›gama,Tib. lung). This set of four kinds of valid cognition came from the non-Buddhist school of theLogicians and was the most widely accepted in India. Thus, again just following commonconsensus, Candrakırti provisionally employs this set of four kinds of valid cognition as themost common, conventional model of our ways of knowing on the level of seeming reality. Hedoes not refer to the set of only two valid cognitions (perceptual and inferential) as asserted byBuddhist logicians such as Dign›ga and Dharmakırti.813ACIP TD3860@081A.814Ibid., @025B.815This is obviously an interpretation of the term “autonomous” (svatantra/rang rgyud) thatis different from the Gelugpa understanding (the latter requiring the three modes in relationto phenomena that are established through their own specific characteristics and a correspon-ding valid cognition). Mikyö Dorje’s explanation of the term “autonomous” seems furthermoreto hinge on the double meaning of svatantra/rang rgyud, since this can also mean “one’s owncontinuum.” Inasmuch as all reasonings employed by Consequentialists arise and are pro-nounced within their own personal continua, such reasonings are “autonomous” in this sense,since they clearly do not arise or are pronounced within the continua of others. Thus, theabove passage could also be read, “ . . . these three modes are stated as such by the first debater’sown continuum (rang rgyud) and not by the continuum of others (gzhan rgyud).”816In Buddhism, there are only two possible types of sounds: those that are brought aboutby the efforts of sentient beings (such as speech or music) and those that are not (such as thesound of the wind or a river).817The explanations under (2c) correspond very much with Candrakırti’s and Rongtön ShejaKünrig’s understanding of autonomous reasoning and to what extent Consequentialists can useit (see Yoshimizu and Cabezón in Dreyfus and McClintock 2003, pp. 257–88 and 298–301).To simplify somewhat, one could say that autonomous reasoning in this sense generally meansany probative argument with the correct three modes (for or by whomever these may be estab-lished) that says “how it is” (either conventionally or ultimately). According to Rongtön’scommentary on The Entrance into Centrism(Nges don rnam nges), Consequentialists employ,for example, “inferences acknowledged by others” (Tib. gzhan grags kyi rjes dpag), which canbe seen as the Consequentialist equivalent of autonomous reasoning (Rong ston shes bya kunrig, n.d., pp. 77–78). He further explains: “What is the difference between ‘inferences acknowl-edged by others’ and autonomous inferences? In a probative argument that establishes anautonomous thesis, the three modes are ascertained. [In inferences] acknowledged by others,it is for the sake of eliminating the wrong ideas of opponents that one states as the reasonwhat these others accept, without however establishing any thesis in an independent way (rangdbang du).” (pp. 83–84).Endnotes 897Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 897"},{"pageNumber":899,"pageContent":"“Autonomous reasons are rejected, but we do not deny ‘what is to be proven’ and ‘themeans to prove’ as mere imputations. . . . Thus, a reason (which is like [the reflection of] themoon in water) makes an opponent (who is like an illusion) realize what is to be proven (whichis like a dream).” (pp. 74–75).As for the difference between autonomous reasonings and mere absurd consequences (as wassaid above), the latter do not have to involve the correct three modes. This means that they arejust unwanted consequences that follow from another position that was wrong in the first place.Thus, they are logically correct, but their explicit meaning must be false, since it is just anabsurd outgrowth of a previous false statement. If these consequences (such as “if things arosefrom themselves, then it would follow that they arise endlessly and pointlessly”) are supple-mented with a reason that is the opponent’s explicit or implicit position (such as “because thesethings exist already”), the second and third modes usually do apply (at least for the opponent).818ACIP TD3886@88A.819ACIP TD3865@146A–B.820Since the subject in question is in fact a nonexistent, there is nothing that can be attrib-uted to it (such as being impermanent, permanent, a cause, or a result) and also nothing in itthat could be established in common for both debaters.

The details including the above example are found inPram› ̊aviniŸcayaIII.2 (P5710, fol. 286a.5ff.) and its commentaries in the context of refutingthe Differentiators and other non-Buddhist schools who claim that a generality (held to be aunitary, permanent entity apart from its instances) is actually connected to the multiplicity ofits particulars. (As for their connection, they assert a so-called “connection of possession,” suchas between a vessel and a juniper tree in it). This type of reasoning is a rather formal way ofstating the unwanted consequence that “a generality would then not be a unity, because it isconnected to the multiplicity of its instances.” The implied contraposition of this consequence(Skt. prasaºgaviparyaya, Tib. thal bzlog) as a probative argument is, “A generality is not con-nected to the multiplicity of its instances, because—according to you—it is a unity.” Thus,either a generality is a unity, or, it is connected to a multiplicity, but both is impossible. (Dhar-makırti’s final point in this debate is that any connection between a generality and its partic-ulars is not between actual entities, but purely through conceptual imputation.)Logically speaking, the above consequence and its contraposition say the same. However,in terms of their formats, it is just the latter that corresponds exactly to an inference acknowl-edged by others (see the examples with regard to the four possibilities of arising right below).824For an example, see Pram› ̊av›rttikaIV.12–13.825Skt. dÒ ̋a ̊›bh›sa, Tib. sun ’byin ltar snang.

More literal and complete English translations of thefirst chapter of The Lucid Wordsfrom both Sanskrit and Tibetan are available elsewhere, forexample, Ruegg 2002 and Hopkins 1983. I will, however, indicate the original passages fromThe Lucid Wordsin both La Vallée Poussin’s Sanskrit edition (abbr.

For the detailed San-skrit references, see Ruegg 2000.927This heading covers LVP 14.1–16.2 (ACIP TD3860@05B–06A). Candrakırti does not givea definition of autonomous reasoning, but judging from his following discussion, for him thisobviously means a reasoning that demonstrates one’s own position, whose elements (subject,predicate, and reason) and their relations (the three modes) are established in common for bothparties in a debate. This means that when Centrists like Bh›vaviveka use autonomous rea-soning in this sense, its elements and their relations must be accepted by the Centrists them-selves (which is precisely Candrakırti’s main critique). Note that Candrakırti’s understandingof autonomous reasoning substantially differs from that of Tsongkhapa and his followers asdescribed above (i.e., that the reasoning’s elements and relations as well as the valid cognitionthat establishes them must be conventionally established through their own specific charac-teristics from the perspective of the object’s own way of being).928As mentioned above, even a renowned Autonomist like KamalaŸıla (ACIP TD3886@88A)makes the same point of adapting the use of consequences and probative arguments to the sit-uation at hand.929Here, the Karmapa approves of some old manuscripts that comment that Consequen-tialists, for the sake of revealing the Enumerators’ self-contradictions, challenge them by for-mulating arguments and examples that are acknowledged by the Enumerators and result innegating that entities arise from themselves.930LVP 16.2–16.11 (ACIP TD3860@06A).931XVI.25.932Verses 29–30.933LVP 16.11–18.5 (ACIP TD3860@06A–B).934LVP 18.5–23.3 (ACIP TD3860@06B-7B).935The phrase “out of the wish . . . their own certainty” is literally found in Dign›ga’s Com-pendium of Valid Cognition(IV.6ab). That Candrakırti uses it here is not to be seen as anapproval of it on his side, but rather as a way of confronting Bh›vaviveka with a scripturalsource by the Buddhist logician on whom he so strongly relies.936For examples of how the Enumerators may reply to the first Centrist consequence and howthis does not help their position, see the section above entitled “Refutation of MistakenAssumptions about Autonomists and Consequentialists.”Endnotes 903Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 903"},{"pageNumber":905,"pageContent":"937Apart from Candrakırti’s rejection of the ontological foundations of Dign›ga’s and Dhar-makırti’s approach to reasoning, it may be seen as another sign of him strictly following com-mon worldly consensus that he explicitly uses the format of the general five-memberedprobative argument that was commonly used by both non-Buddhists and Buddhists beforeDign›ga and Dharmakırti.938Candrakırti adds that the negation of “arising” also applies to the Enumerators’ own ter-minology of “manifestation,” since “arising” and “manifestation” are alike in that somethingis not observable first and becomes observable later.939Skt. puru ̋a, Tib. skyes bu.940Skt. prak ̧ti, Tib. rang bzhin. For more details, see Appendix II.941LVP 23.3–24.7 (ACIP TD3860@07B–08A).942As Ruegg (1991, 2002) has pointed out, Hopkins (1983) does not just present the reversedmeaning of Buddhap›lita’s consequence (prasaºgaviparıta) as Bh›vaviveka himself formulatesit in the context of the third flaw that he attributes to Buddhap›lita. By relying on the Gel-ugpa literature on the reversal/contraposition of consequences (thal bzlogand thal ba ’phen pa),Hopkins first presents two consequences that Bh›vaviveka is claimed to have seen in Bud-dhap›lita’s own consequence:“It follows that the subject, things, are produced senselessly because of being produced fromself.It follows that the subject, things, are produced endlessly because of being produced fromself.”Then, it is claimed that Bh›vaviveka saw theseconsequences (and not Buddhap›lita’s own)as implying their opposite meaning:“The subject, things, are not produced from self because their production is not senseless.The subject, things, are not produced from self because their production is not endless.” (pp.490-1)The first two consequences amount to contrapositions of Buddhap›lita’s own consequence(prasaºgaviparyaya), which are then treated as “consequences that impel an autonomous rea-soning” (Tib. rang rgyud ‘phen pa’i thal ‘gyur), i.e., the latter two statements. However,Bh›vaviveka said that it follows from Buddhap›lita’s own consequence that entities do arisefrom something other(and not that they do not arise from themselves), because their arisingis fruitful and because it comes to an end. In this, the predicate and the reasons are simplyreversed in meaning and stay in their places, without being turned into the negatives of thepredicate and the reason that then switch their positions (contraposition). Thus, the contra-position of an implicit inference by a consequence (as it is known and used by Buddhist logi-cians like Dign›ga and Dharmakırti) has per se nothing to do with Bh›vaviveka’s simplereversal, which was obviously also how Candrakırti treated the issue in his Lucid Words.To make a complicated matter worse, the Tibetan translation for both contraposition(prasaºgaviparyaya) and reversal of a consequence (prasaºgaviparıta) is thal bzlog. A furthersource for confusion is that prasaºg›p›danaand prasaºg›pattion the one hand (“adducing aconsequence,” as found in the above passages of The Lucid Words) and prasaºgas›dhanaon theother (“implicit proof by a consequence,” as found in Dharmakırti’s Pram› ̊aviniŸcayaIII.2)are all translated as thal ba sgrub pa. Tibetan literature on thal bzlogthen tends to use the termthal ba ‘phen painstead of thal ba sgrub pain the first sense. However, inasmuch as thal ba ‘phenpainvolves contraposition (prasaºgaviparyaya), it is notthe same as thal ba sgrub paas foundin The Lucid Words. Despite the confusing and conflating Tibetan terminology here, it isimpossible to assume that Tsongkhapa was not aware of the differences in meaning.

To be sure, the Karmapa glosses Candrakırti’s answer as “has not formulatedautonomousprobative arguments . . . ,” thus indicating that Candrakırti obviously meant thatN›g›rjuna did not use probative arguments as Bh›vaviveka understands them.Examples of N›g›rjuna’s use of probative arguments in hisRebuttal of Objectionsand itsautocommentary include verse 21cd:However, entities are established as being empty,Because they are without nature.His autocommentary explains:However, my words are established as being empty, because they are without nature. Justas my words are empty because they are without nature, also all entities are empty, becausethey are without nature.Verse 22 says:The dependent origination of entitiesIs what is called “emptiness.”What is dependent originationIs being without nature.His autocommentary explains:Dependently originating entities are emptiness. Why? Because they are without nature.. . . Why? Because they are dependent on causes and conditions. . . . Therefore, it is jus-tified to say, “They are empty, because they are without nature.” Likewise, also my wordsare dependently originating. Therefore, they are without nature. Therefore, it is justifiedto say, “They are empty, because they are without nature.” Just as a vase, yarn, and soon—which are naturally empty, because they are dependently originating—can hold. . . water . . . and protect from the cold . . . , likewise also my words (which are withoutnature, because they are dependently originating) can very well prove that entities arewithout nature. (ACIP TD3832@126B–127A; other examples are verses 24, 63, and67–69).Not only does N›g›rjuna here formulate quite a number of probative arguments of the for-mat A is B because of C, but even all the members of a five-membered probative argument arefound:[1, thesis] My words are empty, [2, reason] because they are without nature. All entitiesthat are without nature are empty, [3, example] just like a vase or yarn. Likewise, [4,application] my words are without nature. [5, conclusion] Therefore, because of beingwithout nature, my words are empty.As for the Akutobhay›(P5229), the earliest commentary on The Fundamental Verses, it is tra-ditionally attributed to N›g›rjuna himself, but this is not accepted by the followers ofTsongkhapa, many Sakya masters and some modern scholars. This text is not even mentionedby Buddhap›lita, Bh›vaviveka, and Candrakırti, while being identified as N›g›rjuna’s auto-commentary by Avalokitavrata.

For details, see the section below entitled “Do Hearers and SolitaryRealizers Realize Emptiness?”953LVP 25.7–26.2 (ACIP TD3860@08B).954LVP 26.2–31.1 (ACIP TD3860@08B–10A).955ACIP KD0095@145A.956XVIII.10.957It is to be noted that, in his Heart of Centrism, Bh›vaviveka himself explicitly states thatarising from itself is not justified even on the seeming level (III.139).958Most commentators understand the opponents here to be the Differentiators. However,if one considers the reasoning at hand as a whole (sound is impermanent, because it is pro-duced), since the Differentiators also say that sound is impermanent (despite being a propertyof space), Buddhists would not have to prove its impermanence to them. Thus, one may iden-tify the opponent here as the Analyzers, who say that sound is a property of space and perma-nent.959The latter is Mikyö Dorje’s identification.960The Tibetan says mngon par gsal ba, which is used throughout for the Sanskrit abhivyaktias a typical term of the Enumerators (thus Mikyö Dorje’s identification of the opponent hereas the Enumerators). However, the Sanskrit here is vyaºgya, which is similar in meaning butthe typical term of the Analyzers.961Verse 30.962For example, Williams (1985) has demonstrated that the views ascribed by JamyangShayba (1648–1722) to Majaba Jangchub Dsöndrü do not correspond at all to what the lattersays himself. In her detailed study of the views of early Tibetan Centrists that are consideredfalse by the Gelugpas, Yoshimizu (1993) comes to the conclusion that Jamyang Shayba’s “attri-bution of the ‘false interpretations’ of the Pr›saºgika-Madhyamaka theory to the early Cen-trist masters related to Pa tshab and Jay›nanda is by no means reliable.

As the autocommentary says: “The latent tendencies of ignoranceare the obstruction to the complete analysis of all knowable objects. The existence of latent ten-dencies of desire and such is the cause for such [strange] physical and verbal behaviors [evenin arhats]. The latent tendencies of ignorance, desire, and so on only cease in omniscient Bud-dhas, but not in others.” (ACIP TD3862@342B–343A).Thus, the Karmapa says, the claim by some Tibetans that “Consequentialists do not pres-ent the latent tendencies of the afflictions as cognitive obscurations” can only mean that theydid not make the effort to read this even once (Mi bskyod rdo rje 1996, p. 693).Apart from the Consequentialists’ distinction between afflictive and cognitive obscurations,there are a number of other—more or less differing—ways of making this distinction. Mostof them are based on the system of Maitreya/Asaºga. There it is said that the afflictive obscu-rations are just the manifest afflictions, including the afflicted kind of ignorance, understoodas ignorance about and clinging to an “I” (as a real personal self). The cognitive obscurationsare constituted by the latent tendencies of the afflictions and unafflicted ignorance. The latteris again described in various ways. Some say that it has three degrees of subtlety: clinging toreality (Tib. bden ’dzin), clinging to characteristics (mtshan ’dzin), and clinging to duality(gnyis ’dzin). The Sublime Continuum(V.14ab) says that the cognitive obscurations (as equiv-alent to unafflicted ignorance) are the conceptions about the three spheres (agent, object, andaction). Maitreya’s Distinction between the Middle and Extremes(II.14–16) describes them as ten-fold in correspondence with what is relinquished on the ten grounds of bodhisattvas. Themost detailed description of the cognitive obscurations is found in The Ornament of ClearRealizationand its commentaries, which speak about “the one hundred eight conceptionsabout the apprehender and the apprehended.” (There are two sets of nine misconceptionsabout both the apprehender and the apprehended, thus making thirty-six. These are furtherrelated to each of the three realms, thus resulting in one hundred eight.) The factors to be relin-quished on the paths of junction, seeing, and meditation respectively are equally constitutedby this same set of misconceptions, the difference lying merely in their degrees of subtlety.1015IV.86.1016XV.7.1017IV.90, 93.1018This represents a brief list of the classic sets of criteria for whether the perfections, suchas generosity, are the actual perfections leading to Buddhahood or just conditioned positiveactions leading only to better rebirths within cyclic existence.

Consequentialists do not followother proponents of philosophical systems, but just the conventions used by worldly people;Consequentialists say that the noble ones are the sole authorities on the valid cognition of ulti-mate reality, while worldly people are the sole authorities on what is conventionally consideredthe valid cognition of seeming reality.

Thus, for them, an illusion-like seeming reality appears, but this is not mistakenness, because they have no clinging to itsreality. This means that impure karmic appearances exist for Buddhas. Consequentialists saythat since appearances originate from the latent tendencies of unafflicted ignorance, they aremistaken. However, since Buddhas have relinquished all mistakenness without exception, themanifestation of such appearances has completely subsided. Thus, there are no karmic appear-ances that exist for them.

Mtsho sngon mi rigs dpe skrun khang, 1989, p. 482).1033This term is used in a number of different ways in different contexts and also for differ-ent schools. To avoid confusion, it is helpful to keep the following main usages in mind. Inits most general sense, in all Buddhist schools, it just refers to the practice of yoga, i.e., medi-tation practice as opposed to study and reflection (in this sense it is also used in the title and910The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 910"},{"pageNumber":912,"pageContent":"content of firyadeva’s Four Hundred Verses on the Yogic Practice of Bodhisattvas). As can beseen from the early texts of the Yog›c›ra school, such notions as “mere mind” or “mere cog-nizance”—in the sense that all that we experience happens nowhere other than in our mind—originated in the context of meditation practice with its various mental images, before theybecame systematically extended into a denial of external objects altogether. Second, Yog›c›rastands for the other major school of the great vehicle besides the Centrists, and in particularfor the system of Maitreya and Asaºga. Third, this term appears in the term “*Yog›c›ra-Sv›tantrika-Madhyamaka” (a retrotranslation into Sanskrit of a term coined by Tibetans),which is a designation for the system of such masters as ⁄›ntarak ̋ita and KamalaŸıla. Fourth,it is also found in the combination “Yog›c›ra-Madhyamaka,” which can stand for a numberof syntheses between Yog›c›ra and Madhyamaka, including the systems of ⁄›ntarak ̋ita andRatn›karaŸ›nti. In the Kagyü and Nyingma schools, this term is mostly taken to be a synonymfor the lineage of vast activity, which came to be called the system of other-emptiness. In thiscase, often the name “Great Yog›c›ra-Madhyamaka” is used.1034Many proponents of other-emptiness also adduce additional sources of the meaning ofShentong in the tantras, but the systematic presentation of their system is primarily foundedon the texts of Maitreya, Asaºga, and Vasubandhu.1035To translate cittam›traas “Mind Only” is very common but highly misleading, since thiswrongly implies some kind of absolute idealism, i.e., the notion that mind is the only entitythat really or ultimately exists. In particular, when used for Asaºga’s Yog›c›ra, it completelydistorts his view, since there is no connotation of an absolute or sole existence of mind in hissystem at all (this is discussed in more detail below). In general, the use of -m›train Buddhisttexts is a demeaning, restrictive term, not a reifying honorific. That is how it is invariably usedby Buddhists, be it in the Centrist “mere seeming” (sa ̇v ̧tim›tra) or in other common termsused by both Centrists and Yog›c›ras, such as “mere name” (n›mam›tra), “mere designation”(prajñaptim›tra), or “mere delusion” (bhr›ntam›tra). All of these are notions or problems tobe overcome and not to be reified, thus making any idealist and ontological interpretation ofthe terms cittam›traor vijñaptim›traall the more obsolete. Otherwise, one could equallyabsurdly call the Centrists “Proponents of Name Only” or “Proponents of Designation Only”and claim that names and designations are the only ultimately existing entity for them, sincethey repeatedly say that all phenomena are “mere names” (n›mam›tra) or “mere designations”(prajñaptim›tra) (see, for example, N›g›rjuna’s Acintyastava, verse 36, as well as Candrakırti’sLucid Wordsand autocommentary onThe Entrance into Centrism).1036A detailed presentation of the tremendous vastness and diversity of Yog›c›ra and itsdevelopment into the Shentong system in Tibet is beyond the scope of this book. For moredetails, see especially the works by Griffiths, Harris, Hookham, Keenan, Lindtner (1997),Mathes, Schmithausen, Stearns, and Willis.1037In fact, when looking at the meaning rather than merely the words, there are hardly anyproponents of Shentong who make any ontological claim of an inherently existing entity, beit Buddha nature or the perfect nature (not even Dölpopa, if he is read properly). Karma Trin-layba, one of the main disciples of the Seventh Karmapa, summarizes the exemplary positionof the Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje on this. Karma Trinlayba defines Shentong as mean-ing that the unchanging nature of mind as such—which is free from distinctions and bias, nat-urally luminous, and the unity of expanse and awareness—is Buddhahood, once it becomesfree from adventitious stains. That this primordial ground is not affected by any stains is themeaning of Shentong. The fact that this very mind as such is unaware of itself is called “adven-titious stains.” (Paraphrase of a quote in the introduction to Dbu ma gzhan stong skor bstan bcosphyogs bsdus deb dang po, p. ga.)Endnotes 911Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 911"},{"pageNumber":913,"pageContent":"1038In his Chariot of the Tagbo Siddhas, he refutes all kinds of reifying interpretations ofwhat is taught in the lineage of vast activity. However, on the conventional level, he acceptsnonreifying presentations of the three natures. He even says that it is very much in accordwith Centrism, when this lineage presents the three natures as the threefold lack of nature, thusimplying that they come down to the same essential point (Mi bskyod rdo rje 1996, p. 443).For more details, see chapter 5.1039The same is clearly stated in the Seventh Karmapa’s Ocean of Texts on Reasoning(Chosgrags rgya mtsho 1985, vol. I, p. 196) and in Padma Karpo’s Cutting Through Doubts about theThreefold Progression of the Wheels of Dharma(Tib. chos ’khor rim pa gsum gyi dogs gcod),(1973, p. 338).The question of the “final view” of the Eighth Karmapa—if there is such a thing—is arather complex one. In hisHistory of the Dharma, Pawo Rinpoche says that the SeventhKarmapa had prophesied that, since he could only comment on valid cognition and thePrajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras in this life, he would comment further on the other traditional topicsof Buddhist studies, such as Madhyamaka, in his next incarnation (Dpa’ bo gtsug lag phrengba 1986, p. 1276). Thus, the Eighth Karmapa’s major commentaries on Abhidharma, Vinaya,and Prajñ›p›ramit›, and his latest commentary on the sÒtra teachings, The Chariot of theTagbo Siddhas, are regarded as the fulfillment of this prophecy. Pawo Rinpoche states that theEighth Karmapa considered Saraha and N›g›rjuna as the final authorities to clarify the view(Ibid., pp. 1254–55). This accords with what the Karmapa himself says in his Chariot. Pawo Rin-poche also reports that, upon being fully ordained as a monk, Mikyö Dorje received extensiveinstructions on the view of “other-emptiness” by his preceptor and early teacher ChödrubSenge (Tib. chos grub seng ge), who then requested the Karmapa to uphold this view (Ibid.,p. 1236). Thus, before his outspoken rejection of a Shentong-Madhyamaka in The Chariot, hisfirst great commentary (on The Ornament of Clear Realization) uses the term “other-emptiness”frequently, but explains it in a way that is very different from what one would ordinarilyexpect. In fact, this commentary mainly presents the hidden meaning of the Prajñ›p›ramit›sÒtras in terms of the view of the Seventh Karmapa, i.e., the unity of the lineages of profoundview and vast conduct. The commentary also makes it very clear that “Mere Mentalism” is notthe lineage of vast activity. The Eighth Karmapa also wrote a short text on other-emptiness(Tib. dbu ma gzhan stong smra ba’i srol legs par phye ba’i sgron me). However, in both texts, onelooks in vain for any reifying or absolutist interpretation of other-emptiness. One is rathertempted to call the Karmapa’s presentation “Shentong Lite” in comparison with other texts,since it very much accords with and uses the Centrist approach. In addition, Pawo Rinpochereports the Karmapa to have said that it is not reasonable that the view of all teachings on validcognition, Abhidharma, Madhyamaka, and the Vajray›na is other-emptiness (Ibid., p. 1240).In general, it is regarded as one of the signs of a commentator of the highest caliber toexpound each scripture according to its own system and context, without mixing differenttraditions or imposing one’s own “highest” view. Pawo Rinpoche says that this approach isreflected in all commentaries by the Eighth Karmapa, since he always taught in accordance withthe propensities of his disciples and by keeping to the principles that apply to the specific textsof sÒtras and tantras and not by just clinging to a single meaning throughout (Ibid., p. 1254).That one has to treat the systems of Madhyamaka and Yog›c›ra independently in their owncontexts is also expressed by Mikyö Dorje himself.So far, the works of Karmapa Mikyö Dorje have hardly been studied by Western scholars.Instead, unfounded claims about him are often repeated, such as that he was one of the great-est proponents of the system of other-emptiness in the Kagyü lineage. From the perspectiveof his texts, this is definitely not the case. That the Karmapa’s works are often hard to read andrequire careful examination in order to determine exactly what his points in highly complexmatters are does not make it any easier to gain a well-founded picture of his view.

For example, Centrists such as Bh›vaviveka and Candrakırti did not see themselvesas belonging to distinct subschools within Centrism, and the same goes for individualYog›caras. Even the very late Indian master AtıŸa had both Yog›c›ras and Centrists as his per-sonal teachers without seeing any contradiction. For the most part, the categorization of thesemasters in terms of certain schools was only made later by others, especially by Tibetan dox-ographers.1065In fact, both Asaºga and Sthiramati wrote commentaries on N›g›rjuna’s FundamentalVerses, now extant only in Chinese translations (Taisho 1565, 1567). AtıŸa even mentions thelatter as one of the eight standard commentaries on N›g›rjuna’s text used in his day, anotherone (now lost) having been composed by Gu ̊amati (ACIP TD3948@280B).As can be seen from the developments of both the Madhyamaka and the Yog›c›ra schoolsin India, they influenced each other to a considerable degree. There were even syntheses ofYog›c›ra and Madhyamaka, such as by ⁄›ntarak ̋ita, KamalaŸıla, and Ratn›karaŸ›nti (for moredetails, see Harris 1991 and Ruegg 1981, 2000).1066For example, both Asaºga and Vasubandhu wrote commentaries on The Diamond Cut-ter SÒtra(Skt. Vajracchedika). Moreover, Vasubandhu composed a vast commentary on thePrajñ›p›ramit› SÒtrasin 100,000, 25,000, and 18,000 lines (Skt. firyaŸatas›hasrikapañca -vi ̇Ÿatis›hasrik› ̋ ̨›daŸas›hasrikaprajñ›p›ramit›b ̧ha ̨ ̨ık›, P5206). He also wrote commentarieson the DaŸabhÒmikasÒtra(P5494) and the AkŸayamatinirdeŸasÒtra(P5495). Dign›ga wrote asummary of the sÒtra in 8,000 lines (Skt. Prajñ›p›ramit›rthasa ̇graha, a.k.a. Prajñ›p›ra -mit›pi ̊ ̃›rtha).1067For example, Asaºga’s Commentary on The SÒtra That Unravels the Intention.1068ACIP TD3948@280A.914The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 914"},{"pageNumber":916,"pageContent":"1069For example, the three natures appear not only in the Laºk›vat›rasÒtraand theSa ̇dhinirmocanasÒtra, but also in several Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras.

In The Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy(pp.83–84), Takakusu identifies three main streams: (1) the line of Dign›ga, Agotra, andDharmap›la at N›land› University; (2) the line of Gu ̊amati and Sthiramati at Val›bhi Uni-versity; and (3) the line of Nanda, whose tenets were later followed by Param›rtha.1076In general, most Western scholars have finally come to agree that it is completely wrongand misleading to refer to the Yog›c›ra school as “idealist” in the sense that this term has inWestern philosophy (for more details, see, for example, Harris 1991, Keenan 1989 and 1997, andWillis). In fact, this is a particularly obvious example of mistakenly trying to match specificterms of Western philosophy with Indian systems of thought. When I use “idealist” here, it isonly in the sense in which Tillemans uses it: “2. If we wish to satisfactorily answer the ques-tion as to whether Yog›c›ras, like Dharmap›la, were idealists, we must change our usual under-standing of that term. A Buddhist idealist does not just accept mind-dependence or a reductionof existence to mind, but also that mind has a preferred ontological status and is more real thanexternal objects. 3. While Dharmap›la’s acceptance of the reality of mind qua paratantradoesseem to make him an idealist in our revised sense, the structure of his system guarantees thatany attempt to conceptualize or formulate what that mind is like or how it exists is impossi-ble.” (1990, p. 68)1077As for Dign›ga and Dharmakırti, the difficult question of where exactly they fit in ismuch disputed and beyond the scope of this work. Various interpretations cast them asSautr›ntikas, as Yog›c›ras of different types, and, in their final intention, as Yog›c›ra-M›dhyamikas in the sense of Shentong-Madhyamaka (as the Seventh Karmapa holds in hisOcean of Texts on Reasoningthat comments on the texts of these two masters).1078These are the following texts:—The Five Dharma Works by Maitreya (Tib. byams chos sde lnga; see Bibliography)—The Five Works on the Grounds (Tib. sa sde lnga) by Asaºga:1) The Grounds of Yoga Practice, a.k.a. as The Main Corpus of the Many Grounds(Skt.BahubhÒmivastu, Tib. sa mang dngos gzhi) P5536-8.2) The Synopsis of Ascertainment(Skt.

They deal with the correct practiceof the six-branch yoga of the K›lacakra Tantraand treat some of the topics on which Dölpopalater elaborated, without, however, using his specific terminologies, such as “other-empty.”T›ran›tha says that “he is the founder of the philosophical system of mantric other-empty[Centrism].” (The Collected Works of Jo-nang rje-btsun T›ran›tha, vol.

However, the latter definitely was the first one to use it inan extensive way as the cornerstone in his presentation of the dharma.1092In his Triy›navyavasth›na(P4535, fol. 114a), the late Indian Centrist Ratn›karaŸ›nti (11thcentury) was the first to make the distinction between Real Aspectarians and False Aspectari-ans with regard to Centrists.

Mipham’s own Dam chosdogs sel(‘Ju mi pham rgya mtsho 1992, p. 521), a reply to criticism on his commentary on theOrnament of Centrism, says:I do also not have the burden of [having to] establish Shentong,[Since] both Rong[zom] and Long[chenpa] accord with the texts of N›g›rjunaAnd also someone inferior like me is one-pointedly inclined towards them.He continues by saying that he wrote his reply only due to being forced by the words of oth-ers who regard the Shentong like an enemy. A similar approach of trying to eliminate mis-conceptions of what is actually intended by the Shentong view can be found in his gZhanstong khas len seng ge nga ro(translated in Pettit 1999).

Apart from these, he also wrotea number of independent shorter texts on the subject.1103Further sources are the Seventh Karmapa Chötra Gyamtso’s Ocean of Texts on Reason-ing(vol. I), Pawo Rinpoche’s commentary on The Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life, andThe Treasury of Knowledge.11041981, p. 200.1105Lit. “imagination of what is unreal.” This term is not to be confused with the “imagi-nary nature.” In fact, it is an equivalent of the other-dependent nature in its impure aspect, i.e.,when it imagines the imaginary nature. Put simply, the imaginary nature refers to all theobjects that are imagined by false imagination as their subject.1106 I.1–2. In terms of the content, there is an interesting parallel between lines 1cd (“Empti-ness exists within false imagination and false imagination also exists within emptiness”) and thefamous phrases in The Heart SÒtra: “Form is emptiness; emptiness also is form.” In lines 1a–cand again in line 2d, the dialectic process of insight proceeds from acknowledging the seem-ing existence of false imagination via the realization of the nonexistence of the duality of appre-hender and apprehended, to an altogether different sense of existence of emptiness in thatemptiness is not some entity but the actual mode of being of all phenomena. This pattern findsits parallel in the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras. For example, The Diamond Cutter SÒtrasays: “Sub-hÒti, as for the arrangements of Buddha-fields, called ‘the arrangements of Buddha-fields,’ theThus-Gone One said that these arrangements do not exist. Therefore, they are called ‘thearrangements of Buddha-fields.’” (ACIP KD0016@221B).1107In general, when Maitreya and Asaºga refer to “nature,” this does not mean that theydid not understand the teachings on emptiness and the lack of nature. Rather, they are explicitin saying that all notions of nature are nothing but mental constructs, i.e., the imaginary“nature.” Similar to the Centrists, they use the term “nature” but do not attach any claim ofreal or ultimate existence to it.1108ACIP KD0106@22A.1109Ibid., @35B.1110Again, this is not to be understood in any reifying sense (see also the presentation of thesixteen emptinesses in Chapter 2).1111nirvik›raparini ̋panna, Tib. ’gyur med yongs grub.1112avipary›saparini ̋panna, Tib. phyin ci ma log pa’i yongs grub.1113Skt.

As for this distinction between the DharmaBody and the Body of Complete Release, the latter designates the removal of merely the afflic-tive obscurations, as it is attained by the arhats of the hearers and solitary realizers too.

However, there lived no swans in India in ancienttimes, and the Sanskrit clearly refers to a species of white wild goose common in India.

These geese are said tobe able to filter milk from a mixture of milk and water, leaving just the water behind.1117I.45, 46, 48, 49 (P5549, fols. 11b.2–12a.6).1118These are the five physical sense faculties and the mental sense faculty, which includesall types of consciousness.1119Skt. ̋a ̃›yatanaviŸe ̋a, Tib. skye mched drug gi khyad par.1120For the relationship between the three natures, see also the very illuminating compari-son with the example of a holographic image in Kaplan 1990. Such an image appears as some-thing external to and distinct from the perceiver, but there is no such image independent ofsomeone’s experience of it as a three-dimensional object over there. The image does not existon the film, and there is also no conglomeration of light waves that makes up this image. Howit appears is only imagined. Still, there is an experience of this image. Once the light that trig-gers this image is turned off, the image disappears. What is left on the subjective level is theexperience of seeing that there is no such image.1121III.10bc–11ab.1122Verse 23.1123ACIP KD0106@27A–B.1124XIV.34.1125The claim that the other-dependent nature is ultimately existing obviously was knownin India, as is shown by the first chapter of Sthiramati’s Subcommentary on The DistinctionBetween the Middle and Extremes. Sthiramati presents four alternative models of interpretingverse I.1, without, however, providing their sources. The first model says that false imagina-tion (as an equivalent of the other-dependent nature) exists ultimately by its nature (P5534, fol.24b.6–8). This is not, however, Sthiramati’s own position.1126Besides the DaŸabhÒmikasÒtraand the Laºk›vat›rasÒtra, in which this famous sentenceappears rather isolated and somewhat out of context, its earliest source is the Bhadrap›lasÒtra(P760, fol. 15b.1). In the latter, this statement appears as the culmination of a long sectionthat explains that appearances within meditative equipoise as well as all that appears as exter-nal objects are nothing but appearances in the mind. Following this sentence, the text also givesa reason for it: “[All of] this appears in just the ways in which oneself individually imag-ines/conceives it.”As for the system of “Mere Mentalism,” Tibetan doxographies elaborate on many moredetails and subschools, such as Real Aspectarians and False Aspectarians (see, for example,Kong sprul blo gros mtha’ yas 1982, vol. II, pp. 497–510). However, the above points are themain issues that are relevant here in terms of Centrist critique.1127ACIP TD4038-1@77A-B.1128P5528, ACIP TD4027@03A (commentary on verses I.6–7).Endnotes 919Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 919"},{"pageNumber":921,"pageContent":"1129P5534, fols. 35b–36b.1130VII.8.1131Chapter X.256–258 (ACIP KL0107@270A), as quoted in KamalaŸıla’sStages of Medita-tion(ACIP TD3915@33A).

In some of them, the word “transformation” might be appropriate, but thewhole point in terms of the expanse of dharmas, natural purity, or the luminous nature of themind is that there is no transformation of something into something else. Rather, the revela-tion of mind’s wisdom nature as fruitional enlightenment is just a change of its state as seenby a deluded mind, but does not refer to any change in its entity, just like the sun first beingcovered by clouds and then being free from clouds.

The first refers to the second stepin a progressive sequence of realization, i.e., that—without outer objects—there is only theapprehending mind as the subject. The next step is then to realize that this apprehender equallydoes not exist and thus gives way to the luminous non-dual expanse of dharmas.)

This controversy is also dealt with in Avalokitavrata’s sub-commentary on Bh›vaviveka’s text (ACIP TD3859-1@048Aff).In fact, as indicated above by Tillemans (1990), despite this claim by Dharmap›la, the lat-ter’s overall position is rather complex and subtle. For example, in his commentary on TheFour Hundred Verses, he says that the other-dependent nature doesreally exist (in the sense ofnot being totally nonexistent like the horns of a rabbit), but that it is not itself the ultimate.Furthermore, he is found there to say such things as, “One should be convinced of the void-ness of all dharmas”; “The principle of voidness is free from all characters of dharmas, suchas existence, [nonexistence,] etc.” (Tillemans 1990, p. 93); and “So, thus all dharmas arelikened to illusions: in them not the slightest substance whatsoever can be found. . . . Thus,dharmas are produced by causes and conditions; their natures are all void, like an illusion.”(Ibid., p. 171) Indeed, many passages of his commentary might as well have been written bya Centrist. Like Centrists in general, he emphasizes the framework of the two realities. Forhim too, existence and nonexistence pertain to seeming reality, while ultimate reality liesbeyond these as well as all other kinds of duality. Like Bh›vaviveka, he was also concernedwith validating seeming reality.Bh›vaviveka’s position with regard to Yog›c›ra also is not as clear-cut as it might seem atfirst. For example, in this very chapter of The Lamp of Knowledge, he accepts the other-depend-ent nature to be included in conventional reality (ACIP TD3853@243A). In his Jewel Lamp,he even elaborates on “mere mind” as “the subtle, inner yoga” in the progressive stages ofmeditation in Centrism (ACIP TD3854@280A). In his Blaze of Reasoning(on Heart of CentrismV.78cd), he explains that outer objects are produced by karma which is generated by con-sciousness (ACIP TD3856@220B).In fact, often the controversy between these two masters—as well as between other Centristsand Yog›c›ras—represented more certain differences in terms of contexts of meaning than interms of content per se. In addition, accounting for scholarly rivalries among the major Bud-dhist universities at the time, one often finds a distinct flavor of misrepresentation and polemicsin such controversies. As Eckel (1985) says: “Nagao has pointed out how difficult it is to inter-pret the Yog›c›ra position in a way that does full justice to the complexity of these existence-terms. . . . But Bh›vaviveka was free to do something that a modern interpreter might findindefensible: he could take the words at face value and treat the Yog›c›ra formulas as an affir-mation of both an ‘absence’ and a ‘presence.’ . . . In its own terms, the system gives a consis-tent answer . . . . But when Bh›vaviveka takes the Yog›c›ra concepts and projects them ontoa Madhyamaka system with Madhyamaka presuppositions, they give rise to certain obviousanomalies.” (pp. 36, 39).1194Like Sthiramati’s text, Dharmap›la’s work is available only in Chinese translation, calledT’a-ch’eng Kuang Pai-lun Shih(Taisho 1571).1195The first seven verses of this fifth chapter present the position of Bh›vaviveka’s oppo-nents, with the fourth one corresponding to verse I.6 fromThe Distinction between the Middleand Extremes.1196These arguments are a summary of those found in Dign›ga’s filambanaparık ̋›. Thesame issues are also briefly addressed in Bh›vaviveka’s Karatalaratna(Taisho 1578).1197ACIP TD3856@199A.1198For more details, see Lindtner 1986a and Keenan 1997.11991980, p. 187.

(For further details, see Moriyama 1984 and Ichigo 1989.) Justas an aside, the fact that ⁄›ntarak ̋ita refutes both the Real Aspectarian and the False Aspec-tarian approaches makes the claims of some scholars that he is a Real Aspectarian Centristobsolete. He says that all minds—including the wisdom of a Buddha—entail some aspect orimage that is not real. This, however, does not make him a False Aspectarian either, since theyusually claim that Buddha wisdom is without aspects.1210For details and sources, see Moriyama 1991.1211Besides the Yog›c›ras mentioned above, there are a number of other commentators onthe texts of Maitreya, Asaºga, and Vasubandhu and/or authors of independent texts, such asGu ̊aprabha, Jinaputra, Jñ›naŸrı, Kambala, S›garamegha, SumatiŸıla, and Vinıtadeva. Theirtexts remain to be studied, so it is not clear at this point whether some of them were includedamong Centrist opponents. Thus, the above listing of opponents in Centrist texts is not meantas an exhaustive presentation but more as an outline of general trends.1212This text was most probably written some decades before Bh›vaviveka’s Yog›c›ra cri-tique. It is interesting to note that AtıŸa’s Centrist Pith Instructionsincludes Kambala’s Centristworks side by side with those of N›g›rjuna, firyadeva, M›t ̧ce ̨a, and Candrakırti under themodel texts for all Centrists (P5325, fol. 126b.1–2).1213T›ran›tha also remarks that before Bh›vaviveka the followers of the great vehicle sharedthe same dharma, whereas thereafter they “were split into two groups and started having con-troversies.” (1980, p. 187)1214See also the earlier remarks on the very subtle differences in the dispute betweenDharmap›la and Bh›vaviveka.12151997, p. 21.12161991, p. 68.1217Quoted in Kong sprul blo gros mtha’ yas 1982, vol.

More recently,an increasing number of modern Western scholars agree that such presentations are merelybased on the scriptures of Tsongkhapa and his followers, with little if any basis in the origi-nal texts. See, for example, Hookham 1991, Kapstein 2000, Sparham 1993, 2001, and Stearns1995, 1999.1236The approach of the Kagyü curriculum differs to some extent, since the SeventhKarmapa’s Ocean of Texts on Reasoningtreats Dign›ga and Dharmakırti as Yog›c›ras andelaborates on this system.

As mentioned above, MiphamRinpoche’s position is far from being clearly “other-empty,” and he himself said that he wasa Consequentialist.1240This is especially obvious from Rendawa’s writings. For example, in his commentary onThe Entrance into Centrism, contrary to Tsongkhapa, he clearly says that Centrists do not haveany thesis whatsoever. Even the “positions” of negating arising from the four extremes arepronounced merely from the perspective of others with wrong ideas. They are not the Cen-trists’ own system, because for them there is nothing to be negated and thus no negation (Redmda’ ba gzhon nu blo gros 1993, pp. 104–05). Throughout, Rendawa uses the term “the cen-ter free from extremes” (Tib. mtha’ bral dbu ma) as an expression for the correct Centristview, which is vehemently rejected by the Gelugpa school. (In general, Rendawa’s commen-tary accords significantly with the Eighth Karmapa’s Chariot of the Tagbo Siddhas.) Further dif-ferences between Rendawa and Tsongkhapa are listed by the authoritative Sakya doxographerNgawang Chötra (Tib. ngag dbang chos grags, 1572–1641) in his Grub mtha’i shan ’byed(fols.106b–110a; quoted in Ruegg 2000, pp. 63–64).Quite tellingly, despite it being widely known that Rendawa was Tsongkhapa’s first andlong-time teacher of Centrism, the latter does not list Rendawa at all (!) in his own records onthe lineages for his studies (Tib. gsan yig) of N›g›rjuna’s texts including Candrakırti’sLucidWords. Ironically, Tsongkhapa doeslist Majaba Jangchub Dsöndrü and Majaba JangchubYeshe, who were both (falsely) accused of wrong views on Centrism by later Gelugpas.For some features of Sakya Pa ̊ ̃ita’s understanding of Madhyamaka, such as Centrists hav-ing no thesis or tenet of their own, see Jackson 1985 and Ruegg 2000, pp. 169–71.1241Tib. legs bshad rgya mtsho.1242Line 19a.1243Verses 44–45.1244Verses 88 and 101.1245Verse 22.1246XXV.10; see also XVIII.10.1247II.30, fols. 23a.6–23b.1.

Rather, to different disciples at different times, he taught what he deemed appropri-ate for them. It is through their main topics that these discourses can be classified as the threewheels of dharma.The term “wheel” is used here, since, in some of its features, the teachings of the Buddhacorrespond to a wheel. For example, it is compared to the mighty wheel of a Cakravartin kingin that it can overcome adverse factors and obstacles. Through the teachings, one leaves cer-tain paths behind and travels on others with the vehicles taught by the Buddha. As on wheels,traveling on these paths is swift. Another similarity to a wheel is that the teachings possess thespokes of the eightfold path of the noble ones.1295ACIP KD0106@38A–B. The traditions of the P›li canon do not accept the latter twowheels as the teachings of the Buddha. They say that the Buddha only taught the wheel ofdharma of the four realities of noble ones, repeating it three times in terms of the nature, func-tion, and completion of the four realities, thus presenting them in twelve aspects.In the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras, after having referred to this very format, their own teachingson emptiness are identified as the second wheel of dharma: “Then, many thousand sons of thegods residing in the sky above . . . showered down flowers of divine substances . . . and spokethe following words: ‘Oh, through the teachings of this perfection of knowledge, many thou-sand sons of the gods have attained endurance with regard to the dharma of nonarising.

Also, as mentioned earlier, Asaºga’s Exposition of The Sub-lime Continuum(P5526, fols. 77a.5-77b.6) extensively quotes the passage from The SÒtraRequested by King Dh›ra ̊ıŸvarathat compares the three turnings of the wheel of dharma to theprogressive cleansing of a precious stone.1319However, Vasubandhu also wrote a commentary on The SÒtra of the Teaching ofAk ̋ayamati(P5495), following the distinction made in this sÒtra.1320Here, The Treasury of Knowledgeeven says that Vasubandhu’s Principles of Exegesis(Skt.Vy›khy›yukti, Tib. rnam bshad rigs pa, P5562) and its commentary (P5570, by Gu ̊amati)specifically state that the second turning is of definitive meaning. I could not find any suchstatement in either of these texts. Rather, the fourth and only chapter in Vasubandhu’s text thatdeals with this issue says that statements in the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras such as, “All phenom-ena are without nature” are “the guiding meaning” (Tib. bkri ba’i don) within the great vehi-cle and do not explain the definitive meaning (fol. 116b.6). Vasubandhu repeatedly states thatsuch statements are not to be taken literally (Tib. sgra ji bzhin ma yin pa), but are made withcertain intentions (Tib. dgongs pa can; see fols. 116b.8, 118a.2, 122a.7) in order to dispel cer-tain wrong views.

He accordingly differentiates how existence is to be understood on the seeming andthe ultimate level (127b.6ff.). Gu ̊amati’s commentary follows all of this and also relates theterm “non-arising” to the three natures (fol. 150b.3-7). The suchness of all phenomena is saidto be the identitylessness of persons and phenomena, which lies beyond mind’s imaginativeactivity (156a.7-156b.3).It is to be well noted here that all of the above is said to defend the great vehicle againstcharges by the hearers and so on that it is not the word of the Buddha and is mere nihilism.It is obviously not designed as a debate among followers of the great vehicle.1321Kong sprul blo gros mtha’ yas 1982, vol.

(The same is explained in Essence of Good Explanations, 1975–79, pp.700ff.) As explained before, the former term refers to eliminating certain features of something,whereas the latter stands for affirming something that remains after the exclusion of certain fea-tures of this something, such as eliminating the wrong notion that sound is permanent andconsequently ascertaining that it is impermanent.1416Since nonimplicative negations are nonentities, they are by definition permanent.1417Fundamental VersesXXII.12ab.1418Skt. pr›pti, Tib. thob pa.

The same goes for “disin-tegrating.” This means that something that is in the process of disintegrating is a momentar-ily impermanent but still existent entity. However, after this something hasdisintegrated, it issimply gone and not an existent entity anymore. Conventionally, it may be said that what is“left” is the absence of the entity that has disintegrated, but there is no question that thisabsence of an entity is not an entity itself. Rather, any absence that we may refer to is by def-inition just an object of a conceptual consciousness, not an object of direct perception. Forexample, when we smash a vase, the vase has disintegrated as a vase. We cannot see or perceivethe absence of this vase per se; it is only something that we can think of when comparing thestate of an existent vase before with there being no vase now (in fact, without having perceivedan existent vase before, such as when simply looking into the empty sky, we do not even thinkof the absence of a vase, let alone perceive such an absence). All that we can directly perceiveafter a vase has been smashed are the shards of the vase, which in themselves, however, are nei-ther a vase nor the absence of a vase. In the philosophical systems of the lower vehicle, thenotions of arising and so on may also refer to the observable processof arising and such, alsobeing understood as a functional entity. As a technical term, this is called a “nonassociated for-mation” (Skt. viprayuktasa ̇sk›ra, Tib. ldan min ’du byed). Centrists, however, do not acceptthe notion of nonassociated formations, nor do they use the term.Connected to this is the status of the three times—past, present, and future—or rather enti-ties in the three times. The Karmapa explains that, conventionally, only phenomena in thepresent can be said to exist, while the past and future do not exist. In other words, if somethingexists, it has to be right now, otherwise it is either no longer existent or not yet existent. In con-trast, Tsongkhapa holds that all three times exist.1423Many of the twelve links do not refer to a strict, linear causality but are rather meant asmere conditionality in a very literal sense, as the Buddha himself put it: “Without this hap-pening, that does not occur.” Thus, without dying there could be no next life, but the conti-nuity of assuming a rebirth is fundamentally based on and caused by ignorance. So one cannotsay that dying itself “causes” one’s next life.Endnotes 935Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 935"},{"pageNumber":937,"pageContent":"1424ACIP TD3860@188A.1425XVII.6, 21.1426ACIP TD3842@236B.1427ACIP TD3862@279A.1428Ibid., @260A.1429VII.29, 33.1430Rebuttal of Objections, verse 70.1431Fundamental VersesXXIV.20.1432Reprint in rJe’i gsung lta ba’i skor(Dharamsala: 1975, vol.

The corresponding passage of Künzang Pelden’scommentary says:Is that which knows that consciousness is illuminated by itself this consciousness itself,or is it a consciousness other than this one? The first case is not justified: This does notapply here, since it is the given object of analysis. If it needed to be known through a con-sciousness other than this [illuminating] consciousness itself, then there would be an infi-nite regress of that which knows it, and it could not possibly be known. If these [twoconsciousnesses] were not simultaneous, then objects of the past that have ceased orfuture ones that have not yet arisen could not be known. Since there is no mutual depend-ence in something simultaneous in the present, it could not possibly be known theneither. Therefore, onceother-dependent consciousness isnot seen either by itself or bysomething other than itself, and not seen by anythingelse either, an analysis of [its] dis-tinctive features, such as “illuminating” and “not illuminating,”is meaningless. A pres-entation of distinctive attributes with respect to a basis of attribution that was never seenis likesaying, “The looksand the physical condition of a barren woman’s daughteraresuch and such.” Even if described, they are meaningless.(Kun bzang dpal ldan 1994, pp.641–62)1501In his commentary on The Entrance into Centrism, Karmapa Mikyö Dorje says the fol-lowing on this issue of self-awareness and recollection:Self-awareness is not even conventionally established through recollection. For, if therewere certainty about a causal connection between self-awareness and recollection as thereis between fire and smoke, [self-awareness] would be established [through recollection]in this way.

Here, Minyak Künzang Sönam points out that the example of the eyelotion not only does not prove self-awareness but it actually invalidates the existence of self-awareness: Since the eye lotion is an example of something that is very close but not seen, itexactly illustrates that one’s own mind does not see itself, and not the opposite (Pelden andSönam 1993, p. 159).1505Most other commentaries say that line 25a indicates three cognitions: “How somethingis known” refers to conceptual consciousness as opposed to perception (“seen”) and informa-tion from others (“heard”).1506Here this term is used as a synonym for False Aspectarians.1507These are P5280 (ACIP TD3878@192B) and P5281 (ACIP TD3879@191A).1508ACIP TD3872@190B–191A.1509Ibid., @191A.1510Verse 23.1511III.282.

This leaves P5274 and P5277as the possible sources for quotes from what Pawo Rinpoche calls The Small Commentary onthe Difficult Points. The first short quote from this text (p. 127 in Pawo Rinpoche’s commen-tary) accords pretty much with a corresponding passage in P5274. However, none of the otherquotes can be found in either of these two commentaries, nor in any of the remaining ones inthe Tengyur. Unanimously, all further available sources, such as Butön’s History of Buddhism(Lokesh Chandra ed., vol 24, p. 949) and his commentary on the Bodhicary›vat›ra, as well asall Western authors list only the ten commentaries as found in the Bibliography.None of the Tibetan or Western scholars whom I consulted could resolve this issue either.There is some possibility that Pawo Rinpoche still had access to one of the numerous lostIndian commentaries. (It seems to be ruled out that he was just quoting from a very differentedition or translation of P5274 and P5277, since most of the passages quoted in his text aremuch longer than and quite different in content from what these two commentaries say on thecorresponding verses.) There is also an anonymous, fragmentary commentary in Sanskrit thatwas found in the Durbar Library in Kathmandu, Nepal, by Cecil Bendall. L. de La ValléePoussin used this as yet unpublished and unanalyzed manuscript for his edition ofPrajñ›karamati’s Bodhicary›vat›rapañjik›, referring to it as Bodhicary›vat›ra ̨ipp›nı. In anycase, style and context of the passages from the Small Commentaryin question suggest a trans-lated Indian commentary, thus ruling out the possibility that Pawo Rinpoche refers to thenow lost commentary by Ngog Lots›wa (A khu shes rab rgya mtsho’s list, no. 11077).1531The former are the Enumerators. Ak ̋ap›da (Tib. rkang mig pa, lit. “Eye-Feet”) is bet-ter known under the name Gautama and was the founder of the Ny›ya school (he wrote theNy›yasÒtra). He was a follower of the god ⁄iva (Tib. dbang phyug) and received his name inthe following way: ⁄iva appointed him as attendant for his consort, the goddess Uma, whobecame very attracted to this handsome man and displayed all kinds of seductive physicalexpressions in front of him. Since she was the consort of his god, he considered it completelyinappropriate to respond to her flirtations. Thus, he kept directing his gaze to his feet and med-itated in that way.

Mah›meghasÒtra, Tib. sprin chen po’i mdo.1559This refers to the Centrist view that in Tibet was called “the center free from extremes”(Tib. mtha’ bral dbu ma), another name for the view of “the earlier Centrists.” As mentionedin the introduction on the lineages of Centrism, this view was proclaimed by Patsab Lots›waNyima Tra and his four main disciples (specifically Shang Tangsagba); the Sakya masters Ren-dawa, Gorampa Sönam Senge, and Dagtsang Lots›wa; the Eighth Karmapa; Pawo Rinpoche,and others. This view uses Madhyamaka analysis that results in an unqualified negation of allfour positions of the typical Centrist tetralemma without asserting anything instead in orderto completely overcome all conceptualizations. In this way, it is certainly an accurate charac-terization of the Indian Pr›saºgika Madhyamaka approach.This is also what is understood by “the view of neither existence nor nonexistence” whenthis expression is used by its advocates as solely pertaining to ultimate reality, i.e., that “the cen-ter” in the sense of ultimate reality is “neither the existence of a nature nor the nonexistenceof a nature.” Starting with Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), the tradition of “the later Centrists”—theGelugpa school—criticized this view by saying that “nonexistence of a nature” is the correctCentrist view and thus not to be negated (for details, see Chapter 6). In addition, in order todiscredit the above understanding of Centrism, its critics linked “the view of neither existencenor nonexistence” with the notorious stereotype of Hvashang Mah›y›na, through which thisunderstanding, in their eyes, assumed a pejorative meaning.Mipham Rinpoche’s Lamp of Certainty says that this term is also used as a pejorative for thesystem of the Great Perfection. See Pettit 1999, p. 297.1560An expression for the practice of the Great Seal, as exemplified in the Ninth Karmapa’sOcean of Definitive Meaning(Tib. nges don rgya mtsho). The Eighth Karmapa calls the Mad-hyamaka lineage of Maitrıpa “the center without mental engagement” (see the Introduction).1561This also refers to the teachings of the Great Seal, as it says in the Kagyü tradition’sShort Prayer to Vajradhara: “The essence of thoughts is dharmak›ya.”1562This expression can be found in the teachings of the Great Seal, the Great Perfection,the tantras, and even many sÒtras, such as the Prajñ›p›ramit› sÒtras.1563I.e., they mistakenly considered themselves to be the brilliant suns among scholars whodispel the darkness of others’ wrong views.1564The Tibetan is not clear here: It could either be rdo rta(stone horse) or rngo rta(mangyhorse). From the context, it is certain that the sense of the word is pejorative. The DzogchenPonlop Rinpoche said that this is some local jargon of the area where Pawo Rinpoche camefrom.1565There are disputes as to the proper order of verses 42–51 and whether verses 49–51 are theauthentic words of ⁄›ntideva or were inserted later by others. The translation follows the orderof the root verses as they are presented in this commentary (with verses 49–51 inserted betweenlines 42b and 42c according to the context of establishing the great vehicle). See also below afterthe commentary to verse 51.1566The Tibetan here is gal ste ma brtags gcig gis ni(Skt. eken›gamyam›nena sakala ̇ yadido ̋avat).

(To claim the lack of this criterion in the scriptures of the great vehi-cle—teaching impermanence—is wrong in itself, since in fact these scriptures also teachimpermanence. However, this is not the point that is attacked here.) What is pointed out hereis: If the lack of just a single criterion were enough to exclude all sÒtras of the great vehicle fromwhat constitutes the Buddha’s speech, then it absurdly follows that finding a single criterionof the hearers’ sÒtras in the sÒtras of the great vehicle is also enough to include the latter in whatis Buddha’s speech.1568In Pawo Rinpoche’s text, there appears a fifth line of this verse (de ni theg dman la yangmtshungs: “this would apply in the same way to the inferior vehicle too”).

Here,the practitioner newly attains some degree of endurance—or readiness in the sense of lack offear—with respect to profound emptiness.

See also section 4.2.2.1.3.1. The Refutation of the Primal Substance of the Enu-merators below.1652The example of labeling one person as both father and son comes from the Enumera-tors. What they try to illustrate with this is as follows: Whatever is perceived—sound, form,and so on—is basically nothing other than the permanent and single “nature,” which becomesperceptible as various “manifestations” (Skt. vik›ra, Tib. rnam ’gyur) due to the desire of theindividual. This nature actually is the equilibrium of the three “constituents” lightness, motil-ity, and darkness. Here the Centrists’ refutation starts: Unlike a person who is labeled in dif-ferent ways in dependence on other persons, something permanent is something that bydefinition does not depend on anything, otherwise it would be conditioned and thus imper-manent. Hence, the three constituents cannot be something that is qualified in dependence onsomething else. This entails moreover that they cannot be a cause for anything, since they arepermanent, i.e., unchanging and unceasing.1653In the way that Pawo Rinpoche comments on lines 64cd, the term “nature” (Skt.svabh›va, Tib. rang bzhin) can be understood on two levels. First, the Enumerators’ assertionis that the three constituents of darkness, lightness, and motility are what manifest as “cogni-tion” (Skt. buddhi, Tib. blo) and enable actual perception by the self or the “individual,”which is the only factor in their system that is considered sentient or conscious. However,even if this assertion is accepted, the three constituents do not per se have a nature that wouldallow them to perceive sound (since they are unconscious matter).On a more specific level, the phrase “at the time of not being dependent” refers to the equi-librium of the three constituents. This state is just what makes up the primordial “nature” (Skt.prak ̧ti, Tib. rang bzhin), which in itself is not a permanent perception of sound but justundifferentiated primal matter. Moreover, it is said to be imperceptible at all times, whereasthe perception of sound is definitely something that is experienced. Thus, these two—the pri-mordial nature and the perception of sound—cannot be the same.1654These are two of the five Pandava sons, the heroes in the ancient Indian epicMah›bh›rata.1655Mipham Rinpoche’s Ketaka Jewel says here: “If you think that there is an apprehensionof sound even when form is apprehended, all manifestations would be apprehended [simulta-neously] whenever any one [of them occurs], or sound would not be apprehended even when[there is] sound. Since all manifestations are of [this] single nature, it is impossible that cer-tain [manifestations] are [only] apprehended at certain times and not apprehended at the timeswhen others [of them occur]. . . . If what is seen as something distinct [perception of soundand perception of form] is nevertheless one, then it follows that everything is one.” (’Ju mipham rgya mtsho 1979, pp. 91–92)1656Skt. pradh›na, Tib. gtso bo (another name for prak ̧ti).1657ACIP TD3874@075A.1658Ibid., @075B.1659Ibid., @075B–076B.1660ACIP TD3880@267B.

Hence, they continuously and unnecessar-ily experience the appearances of suffering as if they had a self. Since there are such [beings],[bodhisattvas] develop compassion when they observe them, for the following reason: [Bod-hisattvas] are not attached to a personal self and see that others suffer [through their clingingto] such a self despite the fact that they do not have one.

These persons live in the same surroundings as other people. However, fromtheir perspective, deluded appearances, such as the forms of demons, exist. Thus, [for them,]also the suffering caused by these [appearances] and the relief of being free from such suffer-ing exist.” (Ibid., p. 102)1672Traditionally, these eight qualities define how good drinking water should be: cool,sweet, light, soft, clear, pleasant, wholesome, and soothing.1673Skt. m›na, Tib. nga rgyal.

For example, what iswet and moistening is seen as water by humans, as nectar by gods, as pus and blood by hun-gry ghosts, and so forth. In his Chariot of the Tagbo Siddhas, the Eighth Karmapa too refutesthis position.1690What is refuted in verses 80 and 81 are the two possibilities of how a body could theo-retically exist in its parts: It must be the case either that one body with all its parts pervadesthe entirety of our body parts by being an exact one-to-one match or that an entire body withall its parts is present in each and every one of its parts (thus implying a multiplicity of bod-ies).1691Of course, either this is just redundant or else the consequence would be that there aretwo versions of each body part: the actual and the one that belongs to this extra body.1692Here, some Sanskrit versions say k›ya(body, figure) and others k›Ÿthama(wooden pile,trunk). Pawo Rinpoche and Padma Karpo read tho yor(pile of stones). Most other Tibetan ver-sions of this line read lus ni skye bu ltar snang ba(the body appears like a person). The com-mentaries of Ngülchu Togme and Minyak Künzang Sönam simply ignore this and commentin the same way as Pawo Rinpoche does. Most Indian and Tibetan commentaries available tome explain here that the body appears as a person as long as the conditions for such an appear-ance are present; i.e., it does not appear as a person when it is an embryo in its earliest stagesor when it is cremated and only ashes remain. Kaly› ̊adeva and Mipham Rinpoche refer toboth Sanskrit versions and, accordingly, give two different explanations (see the following syn-opsis of other commentaries).1693ACIP TD3874@078B.1694This must refer to the unidentifiedSmall Commentary on the Difficult Points.

It only refers to direct, nonconceptual experiences—physical sensations ormental feelings—on their most basic level; these can be pleasurable, unpleasurable, or neutral.All the elaborated “feelings” and “emotions” of our Western internal landscape are simply con-sidered the subsequent conceptualization of our direct experiences.Endnotes 951Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 951"},{"pageNumber":953,"pageContent":"1696Pawo Rinpoche’s version of lines 90bc has ’di yisinstead of ’di yiand gzhan ’ga’ tsaminstead of gzhan dga’ tsam. Thus, his commentary refers to the following reading:You might say, “Suffering exists in a subtle form.”Isn’t it that this removes the gross form [of pleasure]?If it is merely something other,Any subtlety must still pertain to this.1697As can be seen, the text of verses 90 and 91 is somewhat rearranged in the commentary,which is partly due to the variants in lines 90bc.Padma Karpo’s commentary shows the same variants but gives a different explanation: “Youmight say, ‘At the time of pleasure,suffering exists in a subtle form.However, isn’t it thatthis gross pleasure removes the gross form[of suffering]? Then, it is merely something other;i.e., its gross form has subsided and its subtle form becomes manifest.’Any subtlety must stillpertain to its respective type. Since it cannot go beyond [its type], it is still suffering or pleas-ure [respectively].” (p. 157)Almost all other commentators explain this verse by taking the first three lines as the state-ment of the opponent. Ngülchu Togme’s commentary may exemplify this: “You might say,‘Since the experience of suffering in a subtle form exists, it is definitely a feeling. However,isn’t it that its gross form is removedby powerful pleasure? It surely is. The nature of thissub-tle [suffering] isa joy different from thatgross pleasure, i.e., a mereslight pleasure.’Anyexpe-rience of [such] subtletywould not be suffering, since it must still pertain to thistype ofpleasure.” (p. 344)See also Künzang Pelden’s commentary (Kun bzang dpal ldan 1990, pp. 90–91), which—as so often—corresponds almost exactly to Mipham Rinpoche’s Ketaka Jewel.1698When the text says here “coming into contact,” this refers to all-inclusive mutual con-tact in all dimensions. If infinitesimal particles (or anything else, for that matter) were to touchlike two folded hands, they would come into contact on just the palm sides, but not on theback sides, for example. Consequently, they would not be partless. Moreover, one could notsay that the two particles—or hands—have contact, since only one of their respective sides—the palm side—has contact. Thus, in order to have full mutual contact on all sides, the parti-cles would have to completely interpenetrate each other. This is not possible either, since theyare all equal in having no spatial extension whatsoever that could accommodate something elseinside. For this reason, they cannot intermingle; i.e., they could at most exist side by side with-out overlapping. Strictly speaking, their very quality of being partless and dimensionlessexcludes any contact at all (let alone 100 percent mutual contact), since they do not have theslighest surface that could have contact.1699This refers to verse VIII.101ab:What is called “continuum” and “collection”Is not real, just like a rosary, an army, and such.Some commentators identify the preceding verses about examining the body and its parts(particularly verses IX.85–86) as that “which was already analyzed earlier.”1700There appears no commentary for line 97d. The corresponding passage of KünzangPelden’s commentary reads: “There is no pleasure to be strived for or to be accomplished.And whichpersonwould be afflicted by whatsuffering? They are mere illusory appearancesof a mistaken mind.” (Kun bzang dpal ldan 1990, p. 696)1701Here, only the first and the last among the objects of the five senses are explicitly men-tioned, but this implicitly includes also the remaining three, i.e., sounds, smells, and tastes.1702In other words, if object and experiencer did not have a relationship of being cause andresult respectively, the experiencer would be something without a cause.

Rather, our mindhas to first perceive the sprout (the result) and then infer the existence of the seed (its cause)based on this perception (which, moreover, requires a proper understanding of causality in gen-eral and in this specific case; for example, mere observation of a sprout by a baby without suchan understanding would not reveal the existence of the seed to this baby). Thus, this is aprocess that is more complex than the example suggests.Endnotes 953Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 953"},{"pageNumber":955,"pageContent":"On the other hand, the implication when the opponent’s example is applied to conscious-ness and knowable object is that—just as the perception of a sprout may lead to an inferenceabout the seed—consciousness itself (the result) should be perceived (a) and thus lead to aninference (b) about the real existence of objects (its cause). However, such two extra con-sciousnesses (a) and (b) are not observed and moreover are superfluous. Conventionally speak-ing, unlike a sprout, consciousness in itself is what reveals its perceived object (though not itsreal existence). Thus, there is no need for this mere perception of an object to lead to a fur-ther perception of itself plus to some inference about the existence of an object that it alreadyperceived. Even if one assumes such further consciousnesses, what would they look like? It wasalready refuted in the section on self-awareness that a given consciousness itself can perceiveits own existence (verses 17ff.). If it were another consciousness that perceives the existence ofthe first one, this would result in the fallacy of infinite regress. Thus, a (really existing) per-ception of this first consciousness is impossible, not to mention an ensuing inference that isbased on such a perception. Consequently, the (real) existence of objects cannot be inferredby reason of a consciousness that perceives them. If the perception of objects were proof of theirreal existence, this would moreover lead to the absurd consequence that the objects that are per-ceived in a dream are really existent outside referents, because they are perceived.1725ACIP TD3874@082A–082B.1726Ibid., @082B.1727Verse 48.1728These four possibilities are (1) a single result arising from a single cause, (2) a single resultarising from multiple causes, (3) multiple results arising from a single cause, and (4) multipleresults arising from multiple causes. Thus, “the refutation of arising from the four possibili-ties” is not to be confused with “the refutation of arising from the four extremes,” which isanother name for the vajra sliver reasoning.1729This refers to the explanation of the vajra sliver reasoning below.1730This reasoning is taught in detail in verses 116–142.1731I.1.1732Skt.

This refers to the supreme godhead in Hinduism since the time ofthe Vedas, who is mostly identified as the personal god who creates the universe. Later, thissupreme godhead often became synonymous with the god ⁄iva. Several philosophical systemsclaim the existence of ÊŸvara, such as the Differentiators and some subschools of the Enumer-ators. (In ⁄aºkara’s Advaitaved›nta, ÊŸvara is understood as the impersonal, primordial natureof the universe, thus being identical with the Brahman.)1767It is said that ÊŸvara creates the world through his mental activity.1768Here, all other commentaries that I consulted say: The opponents claim that ÊŸvara cre-ates the self and the particles of earth and such. However, since they also claim that all theseare permanent, there cannot be a relationship of cause and result between them. How coulda permanent ÊŸvara ever create something, i.e., change his state by creating various things?And how could a self or particles ever be created, since their state of eternity does not allowthem to be created or influenced by anything in the first place?1769The point here is that if there were a permanent cause that created everything since theinfinite past and lasts into the infinite future, there would be no results at all, because theircause has not ceased and will never cease. Or, alternatively, the results—just like their cause—should exist infinitely too. Both consequences are disproved by the fact that we see newlyarisen results as well as their cessation everywhere around us. Thus, there cannot be a perma-nent cause like ÊŸvara.1770Verses 123–125 show that any activity of creation by a creator god, such as ÊŸvara, isimpossible, whether it is considered to be independent of other factors or dependent on them.If such activity were independent of anything, nobody else would have to exert any effort atanything, such as producing food by farming, since there could be nothing that was not cre-ated by ÊŸvara. Thus, even if one made one’s own effort, it would be completely in vain andsuperfluous. Strictly speaking, any actions and even any thinking by sentient beings would beimpossible, since these would not come from ÊŸvara. Thus, the whole idea of karma or anyethics would collapse too.If it is said that ÊŸvara is the creator of everything and yet depends on other causes and con-ditions for this, then it follows that, once the causes and conditions for a result are complete,he could not but “create” this result—whether he wants to or not—because it becomes man-ifest at this point and thus must have been created by him. On the other hand, it follows that,as long as these causes and conditions are not complete, he obviously does not have the powerof creation, because the result is not manifest, even if he wants it to be.Thus, in both cases, ÊŸvara is fully under the control of other factors. This not only contra-dicts the claim of his absolute power to create or not create but moreover makes him com-pletely superfluous in the process of producing results altogether: Once the other causes arecomplete, they are fully sufficient to manifest the result. Therefore, an additional creator is notneeded, nor could he prevent the arising of the result even if he wished to. As long as other956The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 956"},{"pageNumber":958,"pageContent":"causes are incomplete, such a creator is of no use either, since he cannot produce the resultwithout them.

For Sanskrit terms and more details, see Appendix I.1775It is to be noted that this cognition itself is not sentient, since it derives from primal mat-ter. Rather—just like a mirror in which one sees one’s face—it serves as a support for the sen-tient self to experience objects. Thus, perception comes about only through the combinationof the self and cognition.1776The following arguments relate to the Enumerators’ position that all manifestation oruniversal flux comes from or has the nature of the three constituents. At the same time, theseconstituents are equated with pleasure, suffering, and dullness respectively. Thus, it follows thatall manifestations must possess these three feelings.1777Here, most other commentaries explain: If you say that pleasure arises from cloth, sincethings like cloth do not actually exist, the pleasure that arises from them does not exist either.1778Moreover, this means that pleasure is both the cause for cloth and its result, which is likesaying, “This one person is both my mother and my daughter.” If the Enumerators were tosay that this refers to two different pleasures—one being the cause and the other being theresult—they would contradict their own basic claim that the constituents, such as light-ness/pleasure, are something single.1779This refers back to the Enumerators’ thesis that, for example, subtle suffering exists atthe time of intense pleasure but is not experienced (verses 88–91).1780On the other hand, if the grossness of pleasure were something different from pleasure(and thus totally disconnected), it would follow that pleasure has to be experienced in just thesame way all the time, even when its grossness has changed into subtlety.1781These two lines could also be read as follows: “You might assert, ‘A nonexistent cannotarise from total nothingness.’” However, among the Indian commentaries, only Kaly› ̊adeva’scommentary supports this reading, while all others seem to understand the Sanskrit ablative(ki ̇cidasattv›d) as indicating a reason. The Tibetan commentaries all follow this, since thetranslations of this verse agree in saying “because” (phyir).1782To recall, the Enumerators basically say that if the result does not exist at the time of thecause, it cannot arise later, since it is impossible for something to arise from nothing. They usethe example of sesame oil, which is already present within sesame seeds and just becomes man-ifest when one grinds them. On the other hand, if one grinds sand, no oil is produced. More-over, there are no other causes that could make a result that does not exist in the first place intoan existent result later. Thus, they say, the result must exist at the time of the cause. However,if entities arise from themselves alone, it implicitly follows that they need no other factors fortheir arising, such as farming or grinding the sesame seeds. Also, if the result already exists atthe time of the cause, there is no need for it to arise or become manifest again, or it would ariseendlessly.Most other commentaries explain lines 135ab in the following way: The Enumerators do notexplicitly assert that the clearly manifest result as such does not exist at the time of the cause,but that is what follows from their claim that it becomes clearly manifest only later. So theyEndnotes 957Center Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 957"},{"pageNumber":959,"pageContent":"deny that the result is entirely nonexistent at the time of the cause and arises completely newly.However, implicitly, this is exactly what their position comes down to, because, by claimingthat the result exists as a potential, they just obscure the distinction between the nonexistenceof the result at the time of the cause and its existence later. Saying that it is not manifest at thetime of the cause amounts to saying that it does not exist. Otherwise, it would have to be per-ceptible in some way at this time, which it clearly is not.1783Some commentaries give the following reason: The knowledge that the result exists inthe cause is a particular result within the consciousnesses of the Enumerators. Therefore, suchresultant knowledge must also exist in worldly beings, because they also have consciousness,i.e., its cause.1784In all Tibetan translations of this verse, the last two lines read as follows:de nyid du ni stong pa nyidIn true reality, meditation on emptinesssgom pa de phyir mi ’thad ’gyurIs therefore unjustified.In Sanskrit, this would be tattvata ̄ ŸÒnyat› tasm›d bh›van› nopapadyate. However, what theselines actually say is tattvata ̄ ŸÒnyat› tasm›d bh›v›n› ̇ nopapadyate, which is confirmed by allIndian commentaries and their Tibetan translations. Thus, the Tibetan should read: de nyiddu ni dngos rnams kyi/ stong nyid de phyir mi ’thad ’gyur. Pawo Rinpoche seems to comment onboth possibilities, with an unusual gloss of de nyid du ni. Except for Bu ston, who explicitlyrefers to both versions, all other Tibetan commentators comment on the first version only,which seems to result from a certain emphasis on the practical application of one’s under-standing of emptiness in meditation.1785The usual reading of lines 139ab refers to the fact that a negation of something has todepend on a preceding notion of this thing; for example, one cannot talk or think about thenonexistence of a vase without having the notion of a vase in the first place. Pawo Rinpocheseems to focus on the necessity of using and communicating with conventional notions orterms—which are always imputations—in order to demonstrate what they refer to.1786ACIP TD3874@084B.1787Ibid., @084B–085A. In the last sentence, Pawo Rinpoche’s commentary quotes line 133b:“Being gross or subtle means nothing but impermanence.” However, Kaly› ̊adeva’s com-mentary clearly refers to lines 134ab.1788Ibid., @085A.1789ACIP TD3876@175A.1790Ibid., @176A. There are some textual variants after “It is that which is superimposed asthe nature [of all phenomena], . . . (Tib. ngo bo nyid du sgro btags pa ste).” In the present text,this quote continues with: dogs pa dang bcas pa ’gog pa yin no zhes(which does not make muchsense; I assume dogs pais just a misspelling of dgos pa). P5278 says: dgag par bzung bar mi nuspa’i phyir ro. ACIP and D3876 both read: dgos par bya ba la dgos par byed pa yin no. (Here, thepassage in P5278 above follows after a few more sentences, which suggests that these are miss-ing in P5278.) Thus, my translation follows ACIP and Derge.1791Some Indian non-Buddhist schools say that results come about through time as theirripening cause.1792ACIP TD3876@176A–176B.1793Most other commentaries relate verses 143–144 to the reasoning of dependent origina-tion.958The Center of the Sunlit SkyCenter Sunlit-06 6/30/09 9:40 AM Page 958"},{"pageNumber":960,"pageContent":"1794It seems that Pawo Rinpoche deemed verses 145–146ab to be self-explanatory, since hegives no further comment. The corresponding part of Künzang Pelden’s commentary says: “Ifthe result is analyzed, is what is to be produced an existent or a nonexistent? What use is a causefora result that is an entity, i.e., something that exists alreadyby its nature? These two are notsuitable as cause and result for each other. You might say, ‘The result is something nonexist-ent that is produced by the cause.’ What use is a cause, if the result’s own entity is a mere non-existent?[There is no need for a cause], since, in general, a nonexistent does not have a causeand such a [nonexistent] remains within its nature of being a nonexistent. You might think,‘A mere nonexistent is not something that is produced by a cause. However, it is the cause thatmakes this nonexistent result into an existing entity.’ No [cause] is capable [of this]: Eventhecombined efforts of billions of causes cannot alter the lack of an entity(i.e., [the lack of] aphenomenon)—or the nonexistence of a nature of its own—into an entity. This is just as thehorns of a rabbit cannot be transformed into an existent, no matter how many causes are com-bined. A nonexistent will never turn into something that has to depend on something [else].Another reason the lack of an entity cannot be transformed into an entity is: It is not justifiedeither that [this lack of an entity] turns into [an entity] without discarding its nature (i.e.,being the lack of an entity) or that it turns into [an entity] by discarding [this nature].” (Kunbzang dpal ldan 1990, pp. 724–25)1795ACIP TD3874@087A.1796ACIP TD3876@176B.1797This refers to Buddha ⁄›kyamuni’s miracle at ⁄r›vastı, where he displayed such feats.1798Unlike the Sanskrit, the Tibetan translation of this verse switches the first two and thelast two lines. Thus, the Tibetan commentaries also give the reverse order of rebirth in pleas-ant and unpleasant states. The Indian commentaries confirm the order that is given here.1799This refers to the golden ground at the very bottom of a four-continent world withMount Meru.1800The Sanskrit for this line is sukhopakare ̊ai ̄ svakai ̄. The Tibetan says rang gi bde ba’itshogs char kyis(“with the rains of my own happiness”) instead of rang gi bde ba’i tshogs chaskyis. This is the common variant of this line in most Tibetan translations. Pawo Rinpocheaddresses the difference in his synopsis of other commentaries below.1801Skt. BhÒmip›laputra, Tib. sa srung gi bu.

He explains that theaccumulation of merit is not gathered in a random way, but by very carefully employing theexpedient conventions of seeming reality, without which ultimate emptiness cannot be taught.The accumulation of merit consists of the perfections, such as generosity, which are all prac-ticed in a nonreferential manner, that is, by not conceptualizing the triad of giver, recipient,and the act of generosity. Those who have referential views are the realists, that is, those whocling to really existing entities.

Originally, it mightwell have been just a scribal error, since, in Tibetan, the difference between these two versionsis just a single letter (charinstead of chas).
