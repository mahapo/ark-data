Not only are its iconographic conventions well known, but an understanding of the history of Tibetan Buddhist art, in terms of schools and stylistic development, is gradually emerging, thanks to the efforts of many scholars. The art of Bon, on the other hand, has remained practically unexplored. The present volume is the first to attempt to describe this art in a systematic manner. This dearth of studies is not due to a lack of material. The Bon religion of Tibet has a vast and complex iconographical heritage, expressed in works of art which are in no way inferior to those of Buddhism. It is my hope that this study, in spite of its shortcomings, will provide new information and fresh insight for readers inter-ested in Tibetan religion and art. I have tried to bring together a representative selection of religious paintings and statues, mainly bronzes. With a single exception (Plate 60), all the pieces originate in Tibet (or the district of Dolpo in Nepal) and date from before the upheavals and devastations of which Tibet has been the victim in the second half of this century. The objects are preserved in private collections and museums in the West, or in monasteries and private households in Tibet or among Tibetans in exile. I have included many objects that have never been published. Some particularly interesting or beautiful objects have been published before, but are reproduced again in the present volume and provided with more detailed descriptions. A survey of reproductions of Bonpo religious art in other publications, arranged alphabetically according to the figure depicted, is provided following Chapter Six in the section entitled Further Visual Sources. The focus of this book is the form and content of the religious art of Bon, in other words, its iconography. Wherever possible, all attributes of a major deity and each individual figure of complex thangkas have been identified. On the other hand, I have not attempted to date the objects reproduced. Dating Tibetan thangkas and bronzes mainly relies on the assessment of. stylistic criteria; this is a task which requires specialized skills which I do not have, and I have accordingly decided not to deal with this question, except in one case (Plate 9) where an inscription provides possible clues to the date. I have translated excerpts from Bonpo texts explaining or describing the . iconographic representations of many of the figures presented. In other cases, short mythological texts have been included. Some of the excerpts have been translated before, while the majority are published here for the first time. Tibetan words and names are rendered in phonetic approximation. I am aware of the inevitable inconsistencies which this procedure entails, but as the Tibetan spelling is given whenever a word or a name occurs for tl1e first time (and in many cases repeated 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"if necessary), confusion can be avoided.

Introduction Tibet is universally regarded as the homeland of one of the major Buddhist civilizations of Asia. Introduced into Tibet in the seventh and eighth centuries, Buddhism soon became the dominant religion. Although Chinese influences were not altogether absent during the initial period of Buddhist activity in Tibet, it was above all to the Indian subcontinent (including Kashmir and the Kathmandu Valley) that the Tibetans turned for their sacred scriptures and traditions of philosophy, art and learning, and monastic life was organized on the whole according to Indian models.1 With its many centres of learning and places of pilgrimage connected with the life of the Buddha Sakyamuni, India became, in the minds of most Tibetans, a holy land of religion. This remained true even after the Muslim conquest of northern India in the twelfth and thirteenth cenhlries caused Buddhism ill India to disap-pear and gradually brought the flow of Tibetan pilgrims to a virtual standstill. Not all Tibetans, however, regarded India as the source of their religious traditions. Since the tenth or eleventh century and until the present day there have been two organized religious traditions in Tibet: Buddhism and a faith that is referred to by its Tibetan name, Bon.2 Western scholars have adopted the Tibetan term bon (bon) together with the corresponding adjective bonpo (bon po) to refer to ancient pre-Buddhist as well as later non-Buddhist religious beliefs and practices in Tibet. Hence, in the context of Western scholarship, 'Bon' has no less than three significations: 1. The pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet which was gradually suppressed by Buddhism in the eighth and ninth centuries. This religion, only imperfectly reconstructed on the basis of ancient documents, appears to have focused on the person of the king, who was regarded as sacred and possessing supernatural powers. Elaborate rituals were carried out by professional priests known as bonpo. It is possible that their religious doctrines and practices were called bon (although scholars disagree on this point); certainly they were so designated in the later, predominantly Buddhist historiographical literature. In any case, their religious system was essentially different from Buddhism. Thus, the rituals performed by the ancient Bonpo priests were above all concerned with ensuring that the soul of a dead person was conducted safely to a postmortem land of bliss by an appropri-ate animal-usually a yak, a horse or a sheep-which was sacrificed in the course of the funerary rites. Offerings of food, drink and precious objects, and, in the case of kings, even of servants and ministers, likewise accompanied the dead. The purpose of these rites was twofold: on the one hand, to ensure the happiness of the deceased in the land of the dead, and on the other, to obtain their beneficial influence for the welfare and fertility of the living. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"2. Bon may also refer to a religion that appeared in Tibet in the tenth and eleventh certturies, at the same time that Buddhism, introduced once again from India after a period of decline in Tibet, became dominant. This religion, which has continued as an unbroken tradition until the present day, has numerous and obvious points of similarity with Buddhism with regard to doctriIle and practice, so much so that its status as a distinct religion has been doubted. Some scholars (among them the present author in earlier publications) have suggested that it could most adequately be described as an unorthodox form of Buddhism.3 The fact that the adherents of this religion, the Bonpos-ofwhom there are many thousands in Tibet and in exile today-maintain that their religion is anterior to Buddhism in Tibet, and, in fact, identical with the pre-Buddhist Bon religion, has tended to be either contradicted or ignored by Western scholars. Tibetan Buddhists, however, also regard Bon as a distinct religion, and it will be argued below that this claim is justified if one emphasizes aspects such as concepts of religious authority, legiti-mation and history rather than rituals, metaphysical doctrine and monastic disci-pline.4 3. Bonis sometimes used to designate a vast and amorphous body of popular beliefs, including divination, the cult of local deities and conceptions of the soul. Tibetan usage does not, however, traditionally refer to such beliefs as 'Bon', and since they do not form an essential part of Buddhism or of Bon (in the sense of the word outlined under point 2 above), a more appropriate term is that coined by RA. Stein, viz. 'the nameless religion'.5 Even if one leaves this third sense of 'Bon' aside, the usual view of Bon in the West has been less than accurate. This is particularly true of the continuous, living religion called 'Bon' (point 2 outlined above) which has often been characterized as 'shamanism' or 'animism', and as such, regarded as a continuation of what supposedly were tlle religious practices prevalent in Tibet before the coming of Buddhism.6Itis worth noting that the argument in support of tllis view is a circular one, the presence of such elements in the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet being inferred from their existence in present-day popular religious practices. Further, the late~, so-called 'developed' Bon religion was often described in distinctly unfavourable terms as a perversion of Buddhism, a kind of marginal counter-current in which elements of Buddhist doctrine and practice had either been shamelessly copied, or else inverted and distorted in a manner which was com-pared with the mediaeval satanistic cults of Europe (no matter whether such cults ever actually existed or not)? This view of Bon was, however, not founded on first-hand research, but on certain polemical writings by Tibetan Buddhist critics of Bon, who tended to employ standard terms of polemical invective. It is only since the mid-1960s that a more adequate lmderstanding of Bon has emerged, first and foremost thanks to the efforts of David L. Snellgrove.8 The religious art and iconography of Bon in the second sense of the word outlined above are the topics of this book This is the religion that emerged in the tenth and eleventh centuries (at least in its present form) and which still flourishes today. Of the pre-Buddhist (or, if one prefers, the pre-seventh-cenlury) art of Tibet almost nothing is known, and iconographical expressions of folk beliefs are for the most part integrated in either the Bonpo or the Buddhist traditions. An adherent of the Bon religion is called Bonpo. A Bonpo is a 'believer in Bon', and for him Bon signifies 'Truth', 'Reality' or the eternal, unchanging Doctrine in 10 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Yungdrung (g.yung drung, Sanskrit svastika), turning counter-clockwise in the manner characteris-tic of Bon. This ritual card, tsakli (tsag Ii), is painted in five colours representing the five elements, and inscribed with the 'Five Heroic Syllables': YANG, RAM, KANG, SRUM and OM (cf Kvcerne 1985: 9 and 16). which Truth and Reality are expressed. Thus, Bon has the same range of connota-tions for its adherents as the Tibetan word cho (chos., translating the Sanskrit 'term dharma) has for Buddhists. Although limited to Tibet, Bon regards itself as a universal religion in the sense that its doctrines are true and valid for all humanity. The Bonpos also believe that in former times Bon was propagated in many parts of the world (as conceived in their traditional cosmology). For this reason, it is called 'Eternal Bon', yungdrung bon (g.yung drung bon). The importance of the term yungdrung, 'eternal, unchang-ing', which for Tibetan Buddhists, but not for Bonpos, translates the Sanskrit term svastika, explains the frequent appearance in Bonpo iconography of the swastika, which is its symbol. In Bonpo usage, the term yungdrung corresponds in many respects to the Buddhist term dorje (rdo rje, Sanskrit vajra). The Bonpo swastika, however, turns to the left, i.e. counter-clockwise, while the Buddhist version turns to the right. This is but one of innumerable examples of a characteristic (although superficial) difference between Bon and Buddhism; in Bon, the sacred movement is always counter-clockwise. This is not, however, an expression of protest, much less of a spirit of perversion; it is, so the Bonpos believe, simply the normal ritual direction which contributes, ultimately, to moral purification and spiritual enlight-enment. Several basic terms in the Bon religion contain the word yungdrung; thus, beings who have advanced on the path of enlightenment are known as yungdrung sempa (g.yung drung sems dpa'), corresponding to the Buddhist term vajrasattva, but in practice having the same range of meaning as the term bodhisattva. In this volume yungdrung sempa will be rendered 'Spiritual Hero', stressing the second element of the term sempa (sems, 'mind'; dpa', 'hero').

They all share a common Tibetan heritage. In particular, there is little distinction with regard to popular religious practices. Traditionally, all Tibetans assiduously follow the same meth-ods of accumulating religious merit, with the ultimate end in view of obtaining rebirth in a future life as a human being once again or as an inhabitant of one of the many paradisiacal worlds of Tibetan (Buddhist as well as Bonpo) cosmology. Such practices include turning prayer wheels, hand-held or set in motion by the wind or a stream; circumambulating sacred places such as monasteries or holy mountains; hoisting prayer flags; and chanting sacred formulas or en.graving them on stones or cliffs. It is only when these practices are scrutinized more closely that differences 12 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET Monks preparing a torrna (gtor rna) from flour and butter, representing a deity invoked during a New Year ritual of exorcism and regeneration, Bonpo monastery at Dolanji, Himachal Pradesh, India."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"appear; the ritual movement is, as already mentioned, always counter-clockwise and the sacred mantra is not the Buddhist \"OlP-mat:ri padme hulP-\", but \"OlP-matri muye sale du\". Likewise, the cult of the inn1J.merable deities of Tibetan religion, whether Buddhist or Bonpo, may at first appear to be indistinguishable; but again, the deities are, in fact, different (although belonging to the same range of divine categories) with regard to their names, mythological origins, characteristic colours and objects held in their hands or adorning their bodies. Even a cursory glance at the doctrines of Bon, as expressed in their literature or explained by contemporary masters, reveals that they are in many respects identical with those found in Tibetan Buddhism. It is this fact that until recently led Western scholars to accuse the Bonpos of plagiarism. The view of the world as. suffering, belief in the law of moral causality (the 'law of karma') and the corre-sponding concept of rebirth in the six states of existence, and the ideal of enlight-enment and Buddhahood, are basic doctrinal elements not only of Buddhism, but also of Bon. Bonpos follow the same path of virtue and have recourse to the same meditational practices as Buddhist Tibetans. In view of the many manifest similarities between Bon and Buddhism, one may well ask in what the distinction between the two religions consists. The answer, at least to this author, would seem to depend on which perspective is adopted,when describing Bon. Rituals and other religious practices, as well as meditational and metaphysical traditions'are, undeniably, to a large extent similar, even identical. Concepts of sacred history and sources of religious authority are, however, radically different and justify the claim of the Bonpos to constitute an entirely distinct religious community. According to its own historical perspective, Bon was introduced into Tibet many centuries before Buddhism and enjoyed royal patronage until it was finally supplanted by the 'false religion' (i.e. Buddhism) from India and its priests and sages expelled from Tibet by king Trisong Detsen (Khri srong Ide btsan) in the eighth century. It did not, however, disappear from Tibet altogether; the tradition of Bon was preserved in certain family lineages, and after a few generations it flourished once more, although it never again enjoyed royal patronage.9 It is claimed that before reaching Tibet, Bon prospered in a land known as Zhangzhung and that this country remained the centre of Bon until it was conquered by the expanding Tibetan empire in the seventh century. Zhimgzhung was subsequently converted to Buddhism and assimilated into Tibetan culture, losing not only its independence but also its language and its Bonpo religious heritage in the process. There is no doubt as to the historical reality of Zhangzhung, although its exact extent and ethnic and cultural identity are far from clear. It seems, however, to have been situated in what today is, roughly speaking, western Tibet, with Mount Kailash as its centre.10 A crucial question-for present-day Bonpos and Western scholars alike-,is the authenticity of a specific Zhangzhung language. Just as the greater part of the canonical, sacred texts of the Tibetan Buddhists has been translated from Sanskrit, the scriptures of Bon have, so the Bonpos claim, been translated into Tibetan from the language of Zhangzhung. Numerous texts have titles that are given, first, in a non-Tibetan form, stated to be \"in the language of Zhangzhung\", followed by a Tibetan translation of the title. As no texts have so far come to light that can be conclusively shown to be of Zhangzhung origin, it has not been possible to identify INTRODUCTION 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"this language with any degree of precision. The issue of the Zhangzhung language !las been hotly debated, especially since the publication of a bilingual Tibetan-Zhangzhung vocabulary by the Danish scholar Erik Haarh in 1968. R.A. Stein, on the other hand, has argued against the existence of an authentic Zhangzhung language. 11 While much more research is needed, it is at the very least clear that the sacred texts of Bon have preserved a large and authentic vocabulary from a Tibeto-Burman linguistic stratum closely linked to languages in the Himalayas and along the Sino-Tibetan border, such as the dialects of Kinnaur (Himachal Pradesh), Tsangla (eastern Bhutan) and the dialects of Gyarong (Sichuan). These languages are only distantly related to Tibetan. Many Zhangzhung words are used in Bonpo texts, quite independently of textual titles, and thus contribute towards giving Bonpo texts a different character from Buddhist Tibetan texts. Such words are (to quote only a few random examples) sheWn, 'heart' (she thun, Tibetan snying); nyiri, 'sun' (nyi ri, Tibetan nyi ma); werro, 'king' (wer ro, Tibetan rgyal po); rang, 'horse' (hrang, Tibetan rta) etc. Some Zhangzhung words occur in the names of deities presented in this book, such as tsame, 'woman' (tsa med, Tibetan skyes dman, d. Kinnauri tsame); se, 'god' (sad, Tibetan Iha, d. Kinnauri sat); ting, 'water' (ting, Tibetan chu, d . Kinnauri ti). The ultimate homeland of Bon is, however-so the Bonpos claim-to be found even farther to the west, beyond the borders of Zhangzhung. The Bonpos believe that 'Eternal Bon' was first proclaimed in a land called Tazik (rTag gzigs or sTag gzig). Although the name suggests the land of the Tajiks in Central Asia, it has so far not been possible to make a more exact identification of this holy land of Bon. Tazik is, however, not merely a geographical country like any other; in Bon 14 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET A ngakpa (sngags pa), Bonpo tantric yogin in Amdo (northeastern Tibet).

Tazik, also known as Wolmo Lungring (,Olmo llmg ring), may thus be regarded as a counterpart to the Buddhist holy land of Shambhala.12 For the Bonpos, Tazik is the holy land ofreligion, being the land in which Tonpa Shemap (sTon pa gShen rab, 'the Teacher Shemap') was born in the royal family and in due course became enthroned as king. Tonpa Shemap is believed to be a fully enlightened bemg, the true Buddha (the word 'Buddha' simply means 'the Enlightened One') of our world age. The Bonpos possess a voluminous hagiographicalliterature in which his exploits are extolled.13 Without entering into details or discussing the many problems connected with the historical and literary genesis of this extraordinary figure, one may at least note that his biography is not, contrary to what has sometimes been claimed by Western scholars, closely related to that of Sakyamlmi. Thus, during the greater part of his career, Tonpa Shemap was the ruler of Tazik or Wolmo Lungring and hence a layman, and it was as such that he incessantly journeyed from his capital in all directions to propagate Bon. It is worth noting that this propagation also included the performance of innumer-able rituals. These rituals,which are performed by Bonpos today, thus find their justification and legitimation in the exemplary exploits of Tonpa Shemap. Con-trary to Buddhism, where rituals generally have no direct canonical basis, in Bon, as pointed out by Philip Denwood, \"we have whole developed rituals and their liturgies specified in the minutest detail in the basic canon\".14 The propagation of Bon by Tonpa Shemap also included the construction of temples and stupas, but not the foundation of monasteries, which are not mentioned at all in his biography. Travelling far and wide and surrounded by his entourage he engaged in the conversion of notorious sinners. His numerous wives,sons, daughters and disci-ples also played significant roles in this soteriological activity, in a way for which there is no Buddhist parallel. It was only late in life that he was ordained, after which he retired to a forest hermitage, and it was only at this point in his career that he finally succeeded in converting his mighty opponent, the Prince of Demons.15 Certain parts of the biography of Tonpa Shemap are clearly related to figures such as Padmasambhava, the eighth-century Indian yogin and magician who, according to the Buddhists, was invited to Tibet by the king and, subjugating the local gods and demons, founded Samye (bSam yas), the first Buddhist monastery (c. 779). He may also be compared to Gesar, the hero ofthe great Tibetan epic who, like Tonpa Shemap, conducts triumphant campaigns in all cardinal directions against the forces of evil. The historical and literary relationship between these various figures remains to be clarified, but it is at least certain that the entire cycle of biographical material relating to Tonpa Shem:ap-whatever its relationship to historical fact-cannot be dismissed as simple plagiarization of Buddhist texts. By the late eleventh century, the Bonpos had begun to establish monasteries organized along the same lines as those of the Buddhists, and several of these monasteries eventually developed into large institutions with hundreds of monks and novices. The most prestigious Bonpo monastery, founded in 1405, is Memi (sMan ri) in the Central Tibetan province of Tsang, north of the Brahmaputra (Tsangpo) river, but there are numerous other monasteries, especially in eastern and northeastern Tibet (Kham and Amdo). Monks are bound by strict rules of discipline, including celibacy. Fully ordained monks are called drangsong (drang INTRODUCTION 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":",UUII.l .fO NOIDrItQI NOg HH.l 81"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Monks playing shawms, gyaling (rgya gling), outside a Bonpo manasten) in eastern Tibet.

The Bonpos have a vast literature which W ~stern scholars ~re only just begin-ning to explore. Formerly it was taken for granted in the West that this literature was nothing but an uninspired and shameless plagiarism of Buddhist texts. The last twenty-five years have, however, seen a radical change in the view of the Bon religion. This.reassessmentwas initiated by David L. Snellgrove, who in 1967 made the just observation regarding Bonpo literature that \"by far the greater part would seem to have been absorbed through learning and then retold, and this is not just plagiarism\".17 Subsequently, other scholars have been able to show conclusively that in the case of several Bonpo texts which have obvious, even word-by-word Buddhist parallels, it is not, as was formerly taken for granted, the Bonpo text which reproduces a Buddhist original, but in fact the other way round: the Bonpo text has been copied by Buddhist authors. IS This does not mean that Bon was never at some stage powerfully influenced by Buddhism; but once the two religions, Bon and Buddhism, were established as rival traditions in Tibet, their relationship, it is now realized, was a complicated one of mutual influence. The nature of the sacred texts of Bon can only be lmderstood in the context of the Bonpo view of history. Bon tradition holds that the early kings of Tibet were adherents of Bon, and that consequently not only the royal dynasty but the entire realm prospered. This happy state of affairs came to a temporary halt during the reign of the eighth king, Drigum Tsenpo (Gri gum btsan po). This king persecuted Bon with the result that a large number of Bon texts were hidden away so that they might be preserved for future generations. For Bonpos, this was the beginning of the textual tradition consisting of 'treasures', terrna (gter rna), i.e. concealed texts that have been rediscovered at an appropriate time by gifted individuals called 'treasure-revealers', terton (gter ston).19 Although Bon was reinstated by Drigum Tsenpo's successor and flourished during the reigns of subsequent kings as it had done before, it was once more persecuted by king Trisong Detsen in the eighth century. This king is portrayed in mainstream Tibetan tradition as a devout Buddhist, thanks to whose patronage the first Tibetan monks were ordained. Bonpo sources maintain, however, that his motives for supporting Buddhism were, on the one hand, the selfish belief that he could thereby prolong his life, and, on the other hand, the argument put forward by certain evil individuals at his court that the Bonpo priests, already equal to the king in power, would certainly take over the whole government after his death.2o Whatever the truth-and leaving aside the question of whether \"later histori-ans have made two persecutions out of what was in fact only one\"21-both Buddhist and Bonpos agree that during the reign of Trisong Detsen, the Bonpo priests were either banished from Tibet or compelled to conform to Buddhism. Once again Bon texts were concealed, to be rediscovered when the time was ripe for propagating Bon anew.

Bonpos also claim that many of their sacred scriptures were transformed by the Buddhists into Buddhist texts, thus reversing the accusation of plagiarism. According to Bonpo historical texts, the final rediscovery of their sacred scriptures began early in the tenth century. The first discoveries are said to have been made by chance. Wandering beggars stealing a box from the monastery of Samye in the belief thatit contained gold and later exchanging the contents-which to their disappointment turned out to be only Bonpo books-for food, has an authentic ring; the same is true of an account of Buddhists looking for Buddhist texts, who, finding only Bonpo texts, simply gave them away.22 Gradually, how-ever, the textual discoveries came to be surrounded by supernatural signs and circumstances. Discoveries of texts were frequently preceded by initiatory prepa-rations, often lasting several years and culminating in visions in whkh supernatu-ral beings revealed the place where the 'treasure' was hidden. Often the 'treasure' is not a concrete book at all, but an inspired text arising spontaneously in the mind ofthe 'treasure-discoverer'; such a text is a 'mental treasure', gongter (dgongsgter).23 Those texts which were considered by the Bonpos to be derived, ultimately, from Tonpa Shenrap himself, were collected to form a canon. This vast collection of texts (the only edition available today consists of approximately 190 volumes) constitutes the Bonpo Kanjur (bKa' 'gyur), forming an obvious parallel to the Tibetan Buddhist canon, likewise called 'Kanjur'. While no precise date for the formation of the Bonpo Kanjur can be ascertained atpresent, it should be noted that it does not seem to contain texts which have come to light later than 1386. A reasonable surmise would be that the Bonpo Kanjur was assembled by 1450. The Bonpo Kanjur, which in turn only constitutes a fraction of the total literary output of the Bonpos, covers the full range of Tibetan religious culture; as far as Western scholarship is concerned, it still remains practically lmexplored.24 A common division of the Bonpo Kanjur is the fourfold one into Sfltras (mDo), Prajnaparamita (,Bum), Tantras (rGyud) and texts dealing with the higher forms of meditation (mDzod, 'Treasure-house'). For the sake of convenience the Indian (Buddhist) terms are used here and elsewhere, but it must be kept in mind that although the Bonpos employ the same Tibetan terms as the Buddhists, they do not accept their Indian origin, since they trace their religious terminology to Zhangzhung. Like the Buddhists, the Bonpos also have a vast collection of commentarial, philosophical and ritual texts known as the Tenjur (brTen 'gyur). The contents are divided into three basic categories: 'External', including commentaries on canoni-cal texts dealing with monastic discipline, morality; metaphysics and the biogra-phies of Tonpa Shenrap; 'Internal', comprising the commentaries on the Tantras including rituals focusing on the tantric deities and the cult of c;!akinis, goddesses whose task it is to protect the Doctrine, and worldly rituals of magic and divination; and finally 'Secret', a section that deals with meditational practices.25 For the present study of the iconography of Bon, textual material has been extracted from the Sutra and Tantra sections of the Kanjur, and from the 'External' and 'Internal' sections of the Tenjur. INTRODUCTION 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"A significant genre within Bonpo literature is that of historiographical texts. The importance of this genre lies in the particular perspective on Tibetan history that it presents, a perspective which is radically different from Tibetan Buddhist texts. Thus, in Buddhist texts, the introduction of Buddhism in the seventh and eighth centuries under the patronage of successive Tibetan kings is regarded as a great blessing, pre-ordau1ed by the Buddha Sakyamuni and carried out by saints and scholars from the holy land of India. Thanks to Buddhism, so the Buddhists maintain, Tibetans acquired a higher ethical code, the art of writing, the subtleties of philosophy and the possibility of reaching spiritual enlightemnent-u1 other words, they became a civilized nation. The picture is altogether different when we turn to Bonpo historical literature. The introduction of Buddhism into Tibet is described as a catastrophe. Writing in 1842, a Bonpo scholar, an abbot of Menri monastery, Nyima Tenzin, described the introduction of Buddhism as ultimately due to \"the perverse prayer of aÂ·demon\" and put into effect when the moment was ripe by \"he who acted like a monk but retained the Five Poisons\", i.e. the Buddhist saint Santarakf?ita. The suppression of Bon is referred to as \"the setting of the sun of the Doctrine\", followed by the dissolution of the Tibetan state and the spread of moral and social anarchy.26 On the other hand, conciliatory efforts have not been lacking; thus one source suggests that Tonpa Shenrap and the Buddha Sakyamw1i were in reality cousins, and their doctru1es, consequently, essentially identicaI.27 It is difficult to assess the number of Bonpos in Tibet. Certainly they are a significant minority. Particularly in eastern Tibet, as for example in the Sharkhog area north of Sungpan in Sichuan, whole districts are popUlated by Bonpos. Another important centre is the region of Gyarong where several petty kingdoms, fully u1dependent of the Tibetan government in Lhasa as well as of the Chinese Emperor, provided generous patronage for local Bonpo monasteries w1til the greater part of the region was conquered in a series of devastating campaigns conducted by the imperial Chinese army U1 the eighteenth century.28 Scattered communities of Bonpos are also to be found in central and western Tibet; of the ancien~ Zhangzhw1g kingdom, however, no trace remains, although Mount Kailash is an important place of pilgrimage for Bonpos as well as Buddhists. Another much-frequented place of pilgrimage, exclusively-as opposed to MOW1t Kailash -visited by Bonpos, is Mount Bonri (Bon ri), 'Mountau1 of Bon', in the southeast-ern district of Kongp029. In the north of Nepal there ar~ Bonpo villages, especially in the district of Dolpo. At a point in history which remains to be determined, Bon apparently exerted a strong influence on the Nakhi people in Ywman Province in southwestern China;3o with this exception, the Bonpos do not seem to have engaged in missionary enterprises. In India, Bonpos belonging to the Tibetan exile community have established (su1ce 1968) a large and well-organized monastery in which traditional scholarship, rituals and sacred dances of Bon have been pre-served and are carried out with great vigour.31 22 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION NOTES 1 For a survey of the early history of Buddhism in Tibet, d.

INTRODUCTION 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE The Peaceful Deities As with Buddhism in Tibet, Bon distinguishes between 'peaceful' and 'wrathful' deities. Bon likewise makes a ftmdamental distinction between deities who are 'enlightened', and thus have transcended the round of birth and death, and deities who are' of this world', and hence are not-or not yet-fully enlightened. This distinction does not, howevel;, correspond to a division into divine as contrasted to human beings. Men as well as women can attain enlightemnent and thus pass beyond the limitations of the round of birth and death, just as transcend-ent, enlightened beings can manifest themselves inhuman form. In fact, sages who lived in Tibet, so the Bonpos believe, before the introduction of Buddhism, i.e. in the period during which Bon claims to have held undisputed sway, as well as lamas in later times, are regarded by followers of Bon as divine manifestations and are worshipped and portrayed as deities in ritual and iconographic contexts. THE FOUR TRANSCENDENT LORDS (Plate 1) The principal peaceful deities are a group of four known as the Four Transcendent Lords, Deshek Tsozhi (bDer gshegs gtso bzhi). This divine tetrad is headed by a goddess, 'the Mother', Yum (Yum), followed by tlU'ee male deities, known as 'the God', Lha (Lha); 'the Procreator', Sipa (Srid pa), and 'the Teacher', Tonpa (sTon pa).1 The Four Transcendent Lords are depicted on the carved book-cover repro-duced on Plate 1. In each successive world-age-the age when man lives, respectively, 100,000 years, 80,000 years, 60,000 years and so on down to ten years-the latter three manifest themselves under different names. In the present world-age, when man lives to the age of 100 years, they are Shenlha Wokar (gShen lha 'od dkar), the God; Sangpo Bumtri (Sangs po 'bum khri), the Procreator; and Shenrap Miwo (gShen rab mi bo), the Teacher. The Mother is Satrig Ersang (Sa trig er sangs). An important source-interesting not least because of its obvious age-for the iconographyof the Four Transcendent Lords, is a manuscript, preserved in Berlin, of the Zermig (gZer mig), the medium-length version in two volumes of the biography of Shenrap.2 This manuscript contains no less than 65 miniatures, depicting the Four Transcendent Lords as well as members of the family and . entourage of Shenrap, narrative scenes and,finally, portraits ofthe lay patrons who commissioned the manuscript. It gives an altogether archaic impression and could well date from the fourteenth or fifteenth century. For each member of the Four Transcendent Lords, the Zermig invokes five different forms manifesting the five qualities of Body, Speech, Mind, Excellence and Power, each manifestation bearing an individual name and distinguished by 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"different colours.3 The majority of these manifestations are portrayed among the miniatures of the Berlin manuscript. On Plate 9 are reproduced the five manifes-tations of the 'Procreator'. These four deities are frequently portrayed on sets of four thangkas. Three thangkas from one set (Plates 4, 5 and 9), and two from a second set (Plates 3 and 8) are reproduced in this book. They are all of the same type, in which the main figure is surrounded by 252 miniature figures of the same deity, the complete set of four thangkas thus giving a total of 1008, corresponding to the number of Enlightened Beings in the present world-age. SATRIG ERSANG (Plates 2 and 3) The name of the 'Mother', Satrig Ersang (Sa trig er sangs), is in the language of Zhangzhung. The first two syllables, Satrig, signify 'Wisdom' (Tib. shes rab), while the following two syllables remain unexplained, although sang (sangs) in Tibetan means 'purified' and is the first element in sangye (sangs rgyas), 'Buddha', a term which the Bonpos, too, use to designate Enlightened Beings. Her name thus indicates her essential character, Wisdom. Just as the Buddhist goddess Prajfiaparamita ('Perfection of Wisdom'), her colour is yellow. Her attributes are the 'Five Heroic Syllables', pawo drunga (dpa' bo 'bru lnga), SRUM, GAM, RAM, YAM, OM, set in a swastika, the symbol of eternity, which she holds in her right hand, and a mirror, which she holds in her left. Her throne is supported by lions. Seated on a shining, white lotus: The Great Mother, Satrig Ersang! The colour of her body is like the essence of gold, Her ornaments, attire and palace Are adorned by pure, golden light. In her right hand she grasps the Five Heroic Syllables, In her left, she holds a shining mirror, She sits on a seat supported by mighty lions addorsed. To the Mother, from whom the Enlightened Ones Of the past, present, and future come forth, Majestic in her power to bless, I, together with donors of generous gifts, Present prostrations, praise and offerings In order to remove the impurity of countless beings.4 .SHENLHA W OKAR (Plate 4) Shen (gshen) is an enigmatic word. In many contexts it seems to signify 'priest'; thus the historical texts of Bon, the earliest of which date from perhaps the twelfth century, relate that each ofthe ancient kings of Tibet was assisted by a minister and a kushen (sku gshen), 'personal priest'. Likewise, the Enlightened Teacher of the present age is known as Shenrap (gShen rab), 'the Supreme Priest'. The exact interpretation of Shenlha (gShen lha) is, however, uncertain. It could be under-stood as 'the God of the Priests', or as 'the God Who Is a Priest'. Wbkar ('Od dkar) signifies 'White Light', 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The body of Shenlha Wokar is white; his hands rest in his lap in the position of meditation. His attribute is a hook held in his right hand, and his throne is supported by elephants. The ontological status of Shenlha Wokar, often called the 'God of Wisdom', is that of bOnlcu (bon sku), 'unconditioned being' or 'supreme being', literally 'Body of Bon' (thus corresponding exactly to the Buddhist category of dharmakaya). This status, as well as his association with light, makes it tempting to regard him as essentially a variant of the Buddha Amitabha of Mahayfu,a Buddhism and perhaps even to suggest influences from the Manichaean religion. Such connections re-main, however, to be substantiated.5 Seated on a shining, white lotus: The Great God, Shenlha Wokar! The colour of his body is like the essence of crystal, His ornaments, attire and palace Are adorned by crystal light. In order to rescue sentient beings From the morass of birth-and-death, He grasps the hoole of Compassion. He sits on a seat supported by elephants addorsed. To the God of Wisdom, the compassionate, Majestic in his power of Compassion, I, together with donors of generous gifts, Present prostrations, praise and offerings In order to remove the impurity of countless sentient beings.6 SANGPO BUMTRI (Plates 5, 6 and 7) Sangpo Bumtri (Sangs po 'bum kIwi) is a deity who brings forth the beings inllabiting the world, and hence he is styled the 'Procreator', sipa (srid pa)? The first element of his name, Sangpo (Sangs po), is etymologically related to Tsangpa (Tshangs pa), the Tibetan rendering of the Hindu creator-god Brahma. Neverthe-less, tllere is no doubtthat Sangpo Bumtriis an authentic Tibetan deity. The second part of his name, Bumtri ('Bum klwi), literally means 'Hundred Thousand, Ten Thousand', and is also fOlmd as the first part of the name of the Tibetan deity Bumtri Gyalpo (,Bum kl1fi rgyal pO).8 Sangpo Bumtri plays an important role in ancient Tibetan cosmogonic myths, where he is identified with the demiurge Yemon Gyalpo (Ye smon rgyal po). In one such myth, his name is explained as follows: \"Because he is enlightened (sangs) from the beginning of time and thus is the lord ofthe hundred.tl,ousand ('bum) (beings), he is given the name Sangpo Bmntri.\"9 A different etymology states that he is accompanied by a hundred thousand male and ten thousand female 'procreators'.1o The colour of his body is white. One hand rests on his lap in the posture of meditation, while the other is raised, holding a bam,er. His throne is supported by garudas.ll His ontological status is that of dzokleu (rdzogs sku), 'perfected being', corre-sponding to the Buddhist sambhogakaya. 26 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Seated on a shining, red lotus: The Procreator, Sangpo Bumtri!

His role in the Bon religion is similar to that of Sakyamuni in Buddhism, but his biography, as related in several texts of varying length, has little in common with that of Sakyamuni. Thus, the greater part of his career takes place while he is a prince, and later the king, of the land of Tazik (sTag gzig), situated, according to Bonpo tradition, to the west of Tibet. He propagates the doctrine.not only by preaching, but also by performing rituals, and his numerous wives, offspring, and disciples play promi-nent roles in this connection (see Introduction).13 Tonpa Shenrap can be depicted in various ways, depending on the stage of his career (e.g. before or after his ordination to monkhood), and several of these forms will be dealt with separately below. When portrayed as the fourth member of the Four Transcendent Lords, however, the colour of his body is dark blue}4 one hand touches the ground as a sign of his enlightenment, the other rests in the position of meditation on his lap. This aspect is thus parallel to that of Sakyamuni at the moment of his enlightenment, but in addition Shenrap holds a sceptre, called a chakshing (phyag shing), in his right hand; it is marked with a swastika, the symbol of Eternal Truth.

They are the object of particular ritual cycles andmeditational practices. Their iconography, though distinct, is often related-especially with regard to colour-to the relevant member of the basic tetrad. These deities will be dealt with in the same order as that ofthe Four Transcend-ent Lords. SHERAP CHAMMA (Plates 10 and 11) Chamma (Byams rna), 'the Loving Lady', is the chief manifestation of Satrig Ersang. Her name derives from cham (byams), 'to love tenderly', to which is added the feminine suffix mao Her name is thus the feminine form of Champa (Byams pa), the Buddhist bodhisattva Maitreya, with whom she otherwise does not seem to share any attributes. She is frequently called Sherap Chamma (Shes rab Byams rna), 'the Loving Lady of Wisdom' . Like several other deities (e.g. Mawe Senge, the 'Lion of Speech', see p. 37) she can assume five-fold form; she can also, like the Buddhist female bodhisattva Tara, appear in eight-fold form, each form banishing fear of a particular danger (Plate 11). She is beautiful and richly adorned; like Satrig Ersang, her colour is yellow and her throne is supported by lions. Her attributes, however, are different: in her right hand she holds a golden vase, and in her left, a mirror. On a throne supported by a lotus, the sun and the moon, And eight agile lions of Wisdom: The Loving Lady of Wisdom! Her body glows with a reddish-yellow light, On her head is a turquoise crest, Her throat is adorned with a necklace, A golden string of 108 beads. On her right and left earrings Turquoise beads are ranged on strings. The upper part of her body, striking a dancing posture, Is bathed in the crystal light of the sun and the 11100n. All her bracelets and anklets Are decorated by clusters of jewels. She is adorned with beautiful, lustrous garments And all the ornaments of a heavenly being. In her right hand, level with her heart, She graciously holds a golden vase; In her left hand, level with her head, She holds a magic mirror supported by a lotus.16 28 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"KUNTU ZANGPO (Plate 12) In the context of rituals, and especially in the meditational traditions of Bon, Kiintu Zangpo (Kun tu bzang po), 'the All-Good', is regarded as the supreme deity, from whom all knowledge emanates. His position is thus very similar to that of Shenlha Wokar, both being regarded as personifications of the bonlcu (bon sku), literally 'Body of Bon', i.e. Ultimate Reality. In death rituals he represents the Ultimate Reality; it is the goal of the ritual to unite the consciousness of the deceased with himP In meditational traditions, he is the source of the lineage of the Aural Transmission of Zhangzhung, the Zhangzhung Nyengyii (Zhang zhung snyan rgyud), one of the three lineages of sages through which the teachings and practices of 'the Great Perfection', dzokchen (rdzogs chen), of Bon are transmitted. IS Kiintu Zangpo is portrayed as a naked Enlightened Being, an image of the enlightened consciousness which likewise is 'naked', i.e. without discursive thought and devoid of mental obscurations such as hate, greed and ignorance. He is without attributes, both hands resting in his lap in the posture of meditation. His colour is usually white, but occasionally blue. In Tibetan Buddhism, too, Kuntu Zangpo (Sanskrit: Samantabhadra) is an important entity, especially in the Nyingmapa and the Kagyiipa traditions. In India, Samantabhadra was at the outset a bodhisattva, but in Tantric Buddhism he acquired the entirely different status of a personification of Ultimate Reality.19 As such, in the Buddhist tradition his bodily colour is generally blue. Kiintu Zangpo has a number of manifestations, all of whom have different names and different attributes. KUNZANG AKOR (Plate 13) Kiinzang Akor (Kun bzang a skor), 'the All-Good, Cycle of A', is a frequently represented form of Kiintu Zangpo (abbreviated: Kiinzang). Like Kiintu Zangpo, Kiinzang Akor is seated in the posture of meditation, both hands resting with the palms upwards on his lap; he is richly dressed and adorned with jewels. On his breast is the Tibetan letter A, the syllable which forms part of his name. A is the final letter of the Tibetan alphabet, in11erent in all the consonants; it is a phonetic symbol of Primeval or Absolute Reality. Thus, one of the traditions of the Great Perfection is known as Atri (A khrid), 'the instructions (khrid) regarding Primeval Reality (A)'.2o A is a frequent element in meditational visualizations and . in mantras, such as AAKARSALEWOA YANGOMDU (a a dkar sa Ie 'ad a yangoJ?1 'dU).2I The attributes which Kiinzang Akor holds in his hands can vary slightly. The figure reproduced on Plate 13 has a lotus on his right-hand side and a small vase on his left. More frequently the deity holds a swastika in his right hand and a vase in his left. THE PEACEFUL DEITIES 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"KUNZANG GYALWA DUPA (Plates 14 and 15) Kiinzang Gyalwa Diipa (Kun bzang rgyal ba 'dus pa), 'the All~Good, Assembly of Conquerors', is seated in the posture of meditation, crowned and adorned with jewels. More rarely his naked body is white and without ornaments. He has five faces and ten arms. Ute follOWing invocation, composed by the great scholar Sherap Gyaltsen (1356-1415), provides a description of this deity, his attributes and entoura,ge:22 Kuntu Zangpd Gyalwa Dupa -His body shines like fire-crystal.

His standing posture, his thousand outstretched arms and multiple faces all combine to give a strong impression of relationship with the Buddhist deity Chemezi (sPyanras gzigs; Sanskrit: Avalokitesvara). In the case of Gyalwa Gyatso, these heads are usually ranged five-five-one, but a variant, shown on Plate 17, has five-three-one-one-one. The name Gyalwa Gyatso (rGyal ba rgya mtsho), 'Ocean of Conquerors', can be understood as referring to the limitless activity of his Compassion, symbolized by his thousand arms and multiple heads. The following invocation is found in the sixth volume of the Ziji (gZi brjid), the extended (twelve-volume) version of the life of Tonpa Shemap, believed to have been revealed as a mental inspiration to Loden Nyingpo (b. 1360):25 The Lord, the All-Good, Ocean of Conquerors -The colour of his body is pure white like snow or a conch, It)s smooth and youthful.

In that existence, he received the name of Chime Tsukpii ('Chi med gtsug phud), 'Death-less One With the Hair-knot'. His supernatural birth from the divine lady: Zangsa llingtsUn (bZang za ring btsun, see Chapter Four) is told as follows:27 Triilshen Nangden transformed himself into a cuckoo and alighted on the right shoulder of Zangsa Ringtsiin who was staying by the shore of a lake.

Chime Tsukpii is venerated as the divine transmitter of the teachings of the Tantras which he received from the god Shenlha Wokar. Transforming himself into a turquoise cuckoo, he flew up to the heavenly sphere ofWomin COg min, Sapskrit: Akani~that where he entreated Shenlha Wokar to proclaim Bon. Filling the universe with light from his body and causing the universe to quake and tremble, Shenlha Wokar proclaimed the Doctrine in the form of Tantra in 16,000 chapters. Having firmly retained the teachings in his mind, the divine youth Chime Tsukpii again transformed himself into a cuckoo and returned to his mother who received the teachings from him. Later, he transmitted the Tanh'as as well as part of the teachings of the Great Perfection to Sangwa Diipa (gSang ba 'dus pa, see Chapter Four). He also transmitted the teachings concerning the deity Purpa (Phur pa) to Takla Mebar (sTag la me 'bar, see Chapter Four). Chime Tsukpii wears the princely ornaments of a Spiritual Hero. The colour of his body is white, and between his hands, resting in the position of meditation, he holds a wish-fulfilling gem, NAMPAR GYALWA (Plates 19,20 and 2l) The doctrine of Eternal Bon was proclaimed by Tonpa Shenrap as he repeatedly sallied forth from his capital to rescue kings and princes from evil rebirths or to enable them to successfully carry out pious tasks. It was in connection with such an episode that he manifested himself as Nampar Gyalwa (rNam par rgyal ba), 'the Fully Victorious One'. The story of this manifestation is fOlmd in chapter thirteen of the Zermig as well as in volume eleven of the Ziji. Below is a summary of the account as found in the Ziji.28 In the land of Goje Gya (rGod rje rgya) a prince is born; because thirty magic letters appear on his body, he is called Kongtse (Kong tse), 'Having Magic Letters of Power', and later he became known as 'the Magic King Kongtse'.29 As an act of piety, the prince decides to build a temple in the middle of a lake; as this task is impossible to accomplish for ordinary humans, he scrutinizes the magic letters in his hand and realizes that in a former life he was allied to a hundred demons, sinpo (srin po). He accordingly travels to the land of demons; they promise to help him, but only on condition that he keeps their aid secret. THE PEACEFUL DEITIES 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The demons lay the foundation of the temple. Kongtse's wife, however, discovers the reason for her husband's long absence. She comes to the lake, whereupon the demons, released from their promise, abandon the site. Kongtse now travels to the border between the land of gods and the land of demons; here he receives the prophecy that the cha (phya) deity Kengtse Lemne (Keng tse Ian med) will complete the construction.3D Together with a thousand artisans, Kengtse Lemne proceeds to the capital, Wolmo Lungring ('01 mo lung ring), where Shenrap instructs him in how to construct the temple. Flying through the air and surrounded by a thousand master artisans, Kengtse Lenme arrives at the lake and the construction of the temple is completed. It is given the name Karnag Trasel (dKar nag khra gsal), 'Brilliantly White-and-Black Spotted'. Because Kongtse had broken the vow of secrecy, an army of demons now returns and tears down the temple, except for the founda-tions. A monster, resting on the bottom of the lake, awakes, and rising to the surface, is on the point of swallowing the foundations as well. On seeing this, Kongtse is terrified; he turns towards the sky and utters a pitiful cry. The cry is heard by Shenrap, who immediately appears, surrounded by his entourage of Spiritual Heroes. Entering the temple which appears again as ifby magic, he emits rays of light in all directions, and transforming himself into Nampar Gyalwa, the Fully Victorious One, the subduer of demons, he emanates four fierce deities. The latter terrify the army of demons, who flee back to the land of darkness; the king of demons is converted and transformed into a young god who becomes the guardian of the temple. NampaI' Gyalwa, accordingly, is Tonpa Shenrap in his aspect of the invincible subduer of demons and, in general, the remover of hindrances. Iconographically, he is easy to recognize, as his right hand is raised with the palm turned upwards in the gesture of vanquishing; his left hand rests on his knee. He is seated in a cross-legged posture. His body is said to shine with a multi-coloured radiance, and he has the fierce smile signifying power.31 He is surrounded by four bluish-black fierce deities, each having nine heads, eighteen\\atms and four legs.32 The heads are those of garuda,lion, dragon, makara (aquatic monster), tiger,leopard, yak and snake; in the centre is the head of a fierce deity. In each hand the deity holds a weapon: arrow, spear, axe, sword, sabre, hanuner, gimlet, saw, razor, disk, mass of fire, boiling water, 'killing sword', 'cutting sword',33lcamali,34 'rectangular stone', chain and thunderbolt. TRITSUG GYALWA (Plate 22) In contrast to the Buddha Sakyamuni, Tonpa Shenrap to a large extent accom-plishes his task of propagating the Doctrine while he is prince and later king of Wolmo Lungring, in other words, while he is a layman. Finally, however, he does receive full ordination as a mOIlle, and as such establishes the tradition of monastic discipline within Bon. At his ordination he receives the name of Tritsug Gyalwa (KIwi gtsug rgyal ba). Iconographically he is represented with the robes and attributes of a drangsong (drang srong), a fully ordained monk, holding the five objects which a monk is allowed to possess: staff, razor,needle, pitcher and bowl, and wearing the six items of dress: upperrobe,lowerrobe, cloak,'lotus hat' and 'lotus boots' (the latter counts 34 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"as two items).35 He is usually shown surrounded by his chief disciples, the Four Excellent Youths.36 Af~r his ordination, Shenrap leads a life of severe asceticism for three ye<;lrs, and it is through the power of his asceticism that he is finally able to convert Khyappa Laring (Khyab pa lag ring), the king of demons. Asceticism is thus an ideal in the Bonpo tradition established by Tonpa Shenrap himself. OTHER FORMS OF TONPA SHENRAP (Plate 23) Tonpa Shenrap is often shown in the dress of a monk, his right hand touching the earth in the geshue of enlightenment. In this form, he does not wear a 'lotus hat'. and is iconographically indistinguishable from the Buddha Sakyamuni.37 The Berlin manuscript of the Zermig has several unusual representations of Tonpa Shenrap, of which three are shown on Plate 23, p. 71. The following peaceful deities play an important role in many Bonpo rituals and are also frequently encountered in religious art. THE SIX SUBDUING SHEN The Six Subduing Shen, Diilwe Shendrug ('Dul ba'i gshen drug), are the deities who rescue sentient beings from the six realms of existence wit:hill the round of birth-and-death. In general appearance and function they clearly correspond to the Buddhist A valokitesvara manifesting himself in the six realms of existence. The Six Subduing Shen are regarded in Bon as emanations from six points of the body of Shenrap.38 They have already been mentioned in the invocation translated above (p. 30); their colours (and sometimes also their names) can vary slightly (below SangWa Diipa is yellow, and not, as has been seen above, blue). They are usually shown standing, holding their respective attributes and wearing the crown and other ornaments of a Spiritual Hero. They may also be seated, however, with or without ornaments.39 They are most frequently repre-sented as follows:4o HELL: colour attribute Sangwa Ngangring (gSang ba ngang ring) bluish-red banner TORMENTED SPIRITS: Mucho Demdrug (Mu cho Idem drug) white nectar-bag ANIMALS: Tisang Rimgshi (Ti sangs rang zhi) green book HUMANS: Sangwa Diipa (gSang ba 'dus pa) yellow drum and shang DEMI-GODS: Chegyal Barti (lCe rgyal bar ti) blue sword GODS: Yeshen Tsukpii (Ye gshen gtsug phud) white lute and book THE PEACEFUL DEITIES 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE THIRTEEN PRIMEVAL SHEN The Thirteen Primeval Shen are regarded as Spiritual Heroes who inhabit 'the region of clear light of intermediate space'. Each presides over one of the thirteen stages of the progress of a Spiritual Hero. In funerary rituals they preside over the intermediate state between death and rebirth (bar do). They are not regarded as emanations of Tonpa Shenrap, but are intimately associated with him; thus, according to the Zermig, they formed part of his entourage at the moment of his birth. They are shown standing, holding weapons, musical instruments, or objects related to birds (feathers etc.) as their attributes (d. Plate 5).41 THE TWELVE RITUALS 'The Twelve Rituals', Choga Chunyi (Cho ga ben gnyis), is the collective term for a group of twelve deities that figure prominently in the Ziji. In this twelve-volume compendium there is a major ritual text devoted to each of these twelve deities,42 and iconographically they are often :represented in sets of twelve thangkas. Some of them also have a well-established cult in their own right. All except one, Namjom, manifest themselves in the peaceful mode, and all except one, Gyalwa Gyatso,have one face and two arms (d. p. 31).

NOTES TO CHAPTER ONE 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO Tutelary Deities The 'enlightened' deities of Bon can be divided into those who apppear in a peaceful mode and those whose manifestation is wrathful, trowo (lchro bo). Chief among the latter are the great tutelary deities, yidam (yi dam), around whom the main ritual and meditational practices of the Tanh'as revolve. One or several Tantras are generally devoted to a particular yidam, and with each yidam are associated a host of attendant beings. TIle icoilography of the tutelary deities of Bon conforms to the basic conven-tions of the same class of deities in Buddhism, such as Cakrasalpvara, Yamantaka or Hevajra. In their typical manifestation, they appear as awe-inspiring figures with several fiercely distorted faces, their numerous arms wielding irresistible weapons. They are enveloped by flames, wear ornaments made fromhuman bones and trample the enemies of Bon wlderfoot. Most of these deities are embraced by a consort of a similarly fierce aspect (although usually portrayed with fewer faces, hands and legs). The divine couple is known as the 'Father' and 'Mother' (yab and yum) respectively. On taking a closer look at each individual yida111, however, one soon realizes that there is no question of simple identity with Buddhist counter-parts. The tutelary deities of Bon have their specific and wuque iconography, detailed in the invocations and visualizations of the Bonpo Tantras and other ritual texts. As in Buddhism, however, the iconography of r yidam is regarded as . consisting of symbolic elements so that to meditate on such a deity is to compre-hend the whole of reality and thus obtain enlightenment. MAGYU SANGCHOG TARTUG (Plate 24) The Tantras of Bon are divided into 'Father Tantras', pagyu (pha rgyud), and 'Mother Tantras', magyu (ma rgyud). TIle cluef deity of the 'Mother Tantras' is Magyii Sangchog Tartug (Ma rgyud gsang mchog thart,hug), 'Supreme Secret of Mother Tantras, Attau1ihg the Limit', often referred to simply as Magyii. He is portrayed standulg Ul the characteristic posture of a yidam, his left legs bent and hls right legs outstretched. He has sixteen arms, each of whlch holds a skull-bowl containulg blood and a fresh heart; he has seven heads, arranged five-one-one: the first five are, from the left, blue, yellow, dark blue, white and green, wlule the upper heads are red and wlute. TIle colour of Ius body is dark blue, and bel1ind Ius body are two raised and outspread WUlgS. He is embraced by Ius consortK yema Marmo (Kye ma dmar mo), 'Red Kyema', whose body, as her name uldicates, is red. The cult of the Mother Tantras is believed by Bonpos to have been transmitted to humans by Zangsa Ringtsiin (see Chapter Four).1 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The 'Father Tantras' focus on five deities collectively known as the 'Five Supreme Ones of the Divine Shrine', Sekhar Chonga (gSas mkhar mchog lnga):2 1.

The epithets and characteristics of the two deities overlap to such an extent that it is not always easy to determine which one is referred to; their iconographic attributes are, however, quite distinct, so that one may immediately recognize the deity in question when examining a bronze or a thangka. The, word gekhO (ge khod) designates a class of ancient Tibetan gods. The etymology of the word is entirely obscure, but it may be taken to be a loan from the language of Zhangzhung. ThegekhO are said to number 360 and to reside on Mount Tise (Ti se, i.e. Mount Kailash), the sacred mountain of Zhangzhwlg. Their number has been connected with the 360 days of the IWlar year:21 \"Ge-khod also has cOlU1ection with the divination gods in Zhang-zhung ju-thig where the 360 gods are represented by the 360 knots ofthe thirty-six strings (mdud-Iha 360)\".22 Welchen Gekho, too, is believed to reside on Tise.23 Welchen Gekho is also known'as Gekho Sangwa Dragchen (Ge khod gsang ba drag chen), 'Gekho, the Secret, Great Violent One'. The epithet Di.idiil (bDud' dul), 'Subduer of Demons', is often joined to the name of the deity and Gekho may be ( omitted, so that several variants of the name are to be found. Thus, the most complete form is Welchen Gekho Dudul Sangwa I)ragchen, alternating with Dudiil Sangdrag, Gekho Sangwa Dragchen and Welchen Gekho. As an abbrevi-ated form of the name, the deity may be simply known as Gekho. While most of these elements may also enter into the various extended names of the tutelary deity Meri, the iconography of the two deities is, as already mentioned, entirely distinct.

These deities have names which make no sense in Tibetan, but which can, at least partially, be understood as Zhangzhung terms. They are KuchiMangke (Kubyimangke) and AtiMuwer (A timu wer),' Ati, Killg (wer) of the Sky (mu)'. 36 Kuchi MaJ;lgke is described as the /I supreme son of the hearts of the Father and Mother\" (i.e. of Gekho and his consort). His body is tiny, like /I a golden spindle\", and has the colour of burnished gold. He has one head and two arms, and in his right hand he holds a sword, in his left, a snake forming a lasso.37 Ati Muwer is regarded as a mythological sage, the first to teach the cult of Welchen Gekho.38 He is also described as a deity, a 'god of wisdom', yeshe lha (ye shes lha) and a kulha (sku lha), 'body-god' -the latter term is probably a variant of sku bla, a term often used to designate the gods residing on holy mountains.39 He holds a bow and arrow of meteoric iron in his right hand, and from his left, he sends forth nine hundred thousand iron garudas.4o MER! (Plate 31) Meri (Me ri) means 'Mountain of Fire', and alludes to the awe-inspiring manifes-tation of the deity, surrounded by flames and reducing demons to utter subjection. Besides Meri, the short version of his name, the deity is also known by a number of other names, which may overlap with the names of the tutelary deity Gekho (see above). Thus he is known as Meri Sangwa Pawo Gyepur (Me ri gsang ba dpa' bo gyad phur), 'Mountain of Fire, Secret Hero, Athlete-Dagger', Meri Pawo Gyepur, or simply Meri Gyepur. He is also known as Gekho Meri Gyepur or WelchenMeri (dBal chen me ri), 'All-penetrating Mo.untain of Fire', or even Welchen Gekho, in which case there is complete terminological identity with the tutelary deity GekhO.41 Like Gekho,Â· he is closely associated with Zhangzhung, and hence he is fre-quently referred to simply as Zhal1gzhung Meri, the 'Mountain of Fire of Zhangzhung'. Iconographically, however, Meri is entirely distinct from Gekho and can be immediately recognized. Like Gekho~ he has nine heads surmounted by a garuda, but only the lower heads are anthropomorphic; the remainder are the heads of various birds and animals. His body is golden yellow, and he wears a hehnet and golden armour. In his eighteen hands he holds weapons and other objects which will be detailed below. In pictorial representations he is not em-braced by a single consort, but is flanked by two female attendants. Ati Muwer appears at the top of his head and Kuclli Mangke in his heart; it may be noted that the description of these two deities differs from the one given when they form part of the entourage of Gekho (see above). Welchen Gekho has nine heads and eighteen arms, Standing with his six legs wide apart. The colour of his body shines like refined gold.

Plate 32 Reverse of thangka, Plate 31 Thangkas frequently have inscriptions on the backside, usually consisting of a series of mantras and a short prayer. In the case of Bonpo thangkas, the manh'as consist of mantric syllables such as A, OM, HOM etc., Tibetan words such as WD Cod), kar (dkm') and du Cdu), and words and syllables such as nye/o (nye 10), tmpii (pm phud), sheWn (she thun), and nyil'i (nyi ri), regarded as being in the Zhangzhung language.

The invocation has been published in KV<erne 1990a, where the Tibetan text with references may also be fOUlld. The text is Khro bo dbang chen gyi p/lO nya'i le'u, fol.1b-4b, text nO.15 in Ziti Icltro sgrub sicaI', Delhi c. 1967. 5 In the line-drawing published in KV<erne 1990a: 121, the attributes held in the three left hands of the deity are, from above, lasso, hook and arrow (without bow). See also Plate 26. 6 Zor, \"an offering hurled towards the enemy\", Karmay 1972: 351. 7 'Liberate', dml (sgroi), is a euphemism for 'kill', the implication being that the demons are prevented from returning to the round of birth-and-death, thus being effectively liberated. 8 dBal indicates any pointed, sharp, piercing object, including the penetrating, consuming force of fire or lighhting; it is h'anslated 'piercing' or 'all-devouring'. See Rock 1952: 1,130-131 (n.109) and Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956: 312-317. gSas means 'god', see note 2 above. 9 Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956: 317 \"wltich has been dipped into the five kinds of poison\" is a misunderstanding, perhaps arising from a tendency to focus on the exterior, 'demoniaca!', aspect of the yidam. 10 Siza 'bal, 'flesh-cleaver' (not translated by Nebesky-Wojkowitz), is glossed sla re, 'axe', in Bonpo Dictionary: 137. 11 Note that the deity on the thangka reproduced on Plate 27 has a trident. 12 Nebesky-Wojkowitz (\"arrow-head\") has clearly read 111de'u for 111Ihe'u. The exact sigltificance of 11lthe'u, 'little-finger', is not clear, but the object wltich can be seen on Plate 27 is the conventional representation of a thUllderbolt. 13 I am at a loss to explain glang re in glang re gshnng chen. 14 Nebesky-Wojkowitz (\"cat\") has clearly readzi (mi) for byi (ba), 'rat'. The translation of 'jug slcyen is tentative, based partly on how the animal is actually held on the thangka, and partly on the supposition that one should read mjug, 'hind part', for 'jug. 15 On Satrig Ersang and Chatrona (below), see Chapter One. 16 Namchi GUllggyal (gNam phyi gung rgyal), 'Celestial Gratldmother, Queen of the Sky', occurs in cosmological myths. Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956:202 and 317 wrongly gives her name as gNam phyi bdud ('demon') rgyal. 17 11lis refers to Cltime Tsugpii, see Chapter One. On Zangsa Ringtsiin, see Chapter Four. 18 On Sipe Gyalmo, see Chapter Four. 19 The deity referred to is Trowo Tsochog Khagying, on whom 104 THE BON RELIGION OF TIllET is the source of the brief sUlllinary given by Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956: 316-317, who has either misread the names of these two deities, or had a faulty matlUscript copy of the text: for Kita 'byings Iha, read mKita' 'gyings Iha and for 11lKha' la gdug (Index p.608 has gdlld, likewise an error) 1110 bdag lam gyi YU111, read ... ba ga lam gyi yil111. 21 Tucci 1949: II,724; Hoffmann 1950: 166,269; Tucci 1970: 240, 242. 22 Kat'may 1975b:198. 23 Tucci 1970:243. 24 Haarh 1968:38. 25 I adopt the spelling found in Bonpo texts, viz. sgm bla.

Such terms, wltich occur frequently in invocations to fierce gods, are sin (srill, wltich is the term occurring here), don (gdon), du (bdud) and gele (bgegs, 'hindrance'). 27 As the god has tiU'ee eyes, tiley form a triangle. 28 Mamo (ma 1110) at1d shinje (gshin Jje) respectively, ef. Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956: 269-273. 29 The sadag (sa bdag), lu (lc/u) and nyen (gnylln) are supernatural, ambiguous beings, often mentioned together. The lu are identified with the Indian naga; in contexts where tltis Indian association would seem to be absent, the Tibetan term lu is retained. Cf.

They are frequently styled bOnkyong (bon skyong), 'Protectors of Bon', kalcyong (bka' skyong), 'Protectors of the Word', or tenkyong (bstan skyong), 'Protectors of the Doctrine'. Although their character and general appearance correspond to similar deities in Buddhism, the Protectors of Bon have their individual attributes, mythology and cult. Most of them manifest themselves in fierce form, although there are exceptions to this rule. SIPE GYALMO (Plate 33) Chief among the Protectors of Bon is Sipe Gyalmo (Srid pa'i rgyal mo), 'Queen of the Created WorId'. Her name is often abridged to Sigyal (Srid rgyal). It is said that she was originally one of the demonic beings called 'the Female Arrogant Ones', and that she was compelled to become a religious protector when Takla Mebar (see Chapter Four) subdued her by giving her his semen.1 She is also known as Namchi Gunggyal (gNam phyi glmg rgyal), 'Grandmother of Heaven, Queen of the Sky'.2 In her most common aspect, she rides a black or a red mule-thus obviously resembling the Buddhist goddess Palden Lhamo (dPalldan 111a mo), 'the Glorious Goddess'-and has three faces and six arms. She also has a dark-brown manifes-tation, and, finally, two forms-a white and a black-riding on birds. Among the many sacred dances of Bon-dances which are still performed today in Bonpo monasteries-one is entirely devoted to representing six different manifestations ofSipe Gyalmo, each being related to a particular time ofthe day and characterized by a different colour.3 The following invocation is directed to Sipe Gyalmo 'Riding a Red Mule', Sigyal Drelmar (Srid rgyal drel dmar), and is excerpted from a Tantra focusing on the goddess:4 As for her three faces, The face to the right is white and smiling, That to the left is red and fierce, That in the centre is bluish-blade and wrathful. Her blackish hair stands on end, Her three eyes shine like the' essence of the sun; Her nose has the beautiful wrinkles of a wrathful deity, Her mouth gapes like a receptacle for an aI/-consuming fire-offering, Her innumerable teeth are ranged like snow mountains, 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Her tongue makes a terrible clicking sound, Her beard sends forth sparks as from an apocalyptic fire, Her roaring resounds like thunder in the sky.

Reddish-yellow venomous snakes are intertwined, Forming writhing necklaces; She is adorned with a threefold rosary Of dry, moist, and blood-dripping skulls. As for her terrifying attributes, In her top right hand she holds a zhingchug5-It is adorned with a crown of silk of various colours, Fluttering in the expanse of invisible space. In her top left hand a swastika Encompasses the secret space of the treasury of her heart. Her middle right hand brandishes a sword To the sky, like a flaming weapon. Her middle left hand holds a trident While a great drum resounds like thunder. Her lower right hand clasps a pointed dagger; Its triangular blade is thrust into the heart Of those who have perverted views. Her lower left hand holds a bowl Filled to the brim with billowing blood. As for the way she places her legs: In order to subdue the four demons of delusion And pelfect the four kinds of forceful action, She haughtily draws in one leg and stretches out the other.

The four hoofs of her mule Are supported by the Four Great Kings of the Quarters. It is said that the cult of the goddess as a Protector of Bon was introduced by Shenchen Luga (gShen chen Klu dga', 996-1Â°35). Her cult has remained extremely popUlar? 108 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"NYIPANGSE AND MENMO (see Plates 27 and 31) Nyipangse (Nyi pang sad) is above all associated with Zhangzhung. He is the guardian deity of the meditational teachings known as Dzokpa chenpo Zhangzhung nyengyii (rDzogs pa chen po Zhang zhung snyan rgyud), 'The Great Perfection, the Aural Transmission of Zhangzhung', which contain meditational practices believed to have been transmitted by the sages of Zhangzhung. 8 It was the 'Teacher of Bon', gyerpung (gyer spungs) N angzher Lopo (sN ang bzher lod po), who lived in the eighth century, who compelledNyipangse to become a Protector ofBon. He did this by performing the ritual of hurling a 'bomb', tso (btso), at the god, at the same time subduing all the sipa (srid pa) deities, male as well as female.9 The dwelling of Nyipangse is the summit of Mount Meru, but this cosmic mountain is identified with Mount Tise (Ti se, i.e. Kailash) in Western Tibet, the holy moutain of Zhangzhung. He is subordinated to the mighty tutelary deity of Zhangzhung, Welchen Gekho (see Chapter Two). In invocations to Nyipangse, the god is described as leasung (blea' srung), 'Guardian of the Word', and tenpe 7calcyong (bstan pa'i blea' slcyong), 'Protector of the Word of the Doctrine'. He is a deity of the category styledgyalpo (rgyal PO), 'king'. He is 'king of the drapla' (sgra bla'i rgyal po) and 'king of tsen' (btsan gyi rgyal po). Gyalpo, dmpla and tsen are all closely related categories of deities, fierce and potentially harmful, but capable of being bOlmd by oaths to protect the Doctrine. Nyipangse has certain traits in common with the great Buddhist religious protector Pehar (Pe har). Both are styled Shelgying Karpo (Shel 'gying dkar po), 'White Crystal-haughty One',lO the colour of both is white, and they are both known as sogdag (srag bdag), 'Lord of Life-force'. The name Nyipangse is in the Zhangzhung language, but cannot be entirely explained. Se (sad) means 'god' and nyi probably 'sun' (d. Zhangzhung nyi ri, Tibetan nyi rna, 'sun'). He is sometimes mentioned as belonging to a group of three deities in which a celestial phenomenon is part of the name: Nyipangse, Dapangse (Zla pang sad, d. Tibetan zla ba, 'moon'), and Zhapangse (gzha', 'rainbow'). Pang remains unexplained. Nyipangse does not have a consort, but he does have a goddess as his companion, the nammen (gnam sman) Namchi Gunggyal (gNam phyi gung rgyal), 'Grandmother ofthe Sky, Queen of Heaven'. This goddess is also known from the epic of Gesar.ll The men (sman) are a class of ancient Tibeta;\" female deities in which Bonpos as well as Buddhists believe.12 This particular men is often known simply as Menmo (sMan mo), or more fully as Men Kumaratsa (sMan Ku rna ra tsa). She, too, was subdued by Nangzher Lopo,13 She has an entourage consisting of 'men of snow-mountains' (gangs sman), 'men of slate-mountains' (g.ya' sman), 'men of cliffs' (brag sman), 'men of pasture' (spang sman), 'men offorests' (nag sman), 'men ofrivers' (chu sman), 'men of lakes' (mthso sman) and 'men of islands' (do gling sman).14 Nyipangse is portrayed as a mighty king, clad in white robes and wearing a white turban. He rides a white horse. He does not have fierce or demonic attributes. One of his characteristics, shared by other gods, is the ability to appear under innumerable guises and different names, \"remaining neither here nor there\"; this fluid, indeterminate form is part of his divine nature. In his hands he holds a banner of white silk. Menmo is likewise without demonic traits. She rides a white yak.

They are believed to be fierce, aggressive beings, portrayed as mounted warriors clad in armour and holding various warlike attributes. In cosmological terms, they are associated with the middle region, the region between the vault of heaven and the underworld, hence they are frequently held to reside on moun-tains; their characteristic colour is red.2o . qne of the major Protectors of the class of tsen is Apse (A bsve). The se (bse or bsve) are a little-known sub-group of deities.21 Apse is depicted in the manner usual for a tsen, as in the invocation translated below. His most characteristic attribute is an owl, which he holds in his left hand; in his right he may hold a sword or a noose, or (as in Plate 34) a spear. He is styled 'cliff-tsen', draktsen (brag btsan), or 'king of tsen', and is said to dwell on the ledge of a cliff to the northeast of MOlmt Tise (Kailash), 'at the border between Mon, Bal and Tibet'.22 The following invocation is said to have been extracted as part of the 'treasure'\" terma (gter ma), from Mount Dungpor in Tanag (rTa nag Dung phor) by Guru N6ntse (Gu m mon rtse, b. 1136):23 HUM!

Drakpa Senge (Grags pa seng ge) is the name of the first 'Red Hat' (Zhva dmar) Incarnation (1283-1349) of the Karmapa sub-school of the Kagyiipa school. The story of how this Buddhist monk came to provide the name of a Protector of Bon has been recounted by S.G. Karmay.27 Briefly, the story is as follows: The Tenth Zhamar Incarnation, Chodrak Gyatso (Chos grags rgya mtsho, 1742-92), was involved with the Gorkha invasion of Tibet in 1792. When the Gorkhas had been driven out of Tibet, the property of Chodrak Gyatso was confiscated by the Tibetan government. He died in the same year, but his spirit turned into a malignant ghost. Eventually, the abbot of the Bonpo monastery of Menri (sMan ri), Sherap Gonggyal (Shes rab dgongs rgyal, b.1784, enthroned as abbot in 1810), summoned him and compelled him to swear an oath to become a Protector of Bon. The abbot was able to do this because he could invoke a cOlmection in fonner lives between himself and the malignant spirit: the spirit had been none other than Shenchung Gowo (gShen chlmg go bo), a son of the Lord of Demons, Khyappa Laring (Khyab pa lag ring); his mother was one of Tonpa Shenrap's wives. The son was looked after by one of the disciples of Shenrap, YungdrwLg Tsukshen Gyalwa (g. Yung drung gtsug gshen rgyal ba). The latter was now reborn as the abbot, while the son of the Lord of Demons was reborn successively as each incarnation of the Red Hat lineage. The abbot consequently gave him the name of Drakpa Senge, the name of the first incarnation. Drakpa Senge is shown wearing the robes and the hat of a Buddhist monk, riding a horse. P ANGTSEN (Plate 36) Innumerable minor deities are the local protectors of specific sites. They are seldom known outside their own locality, and indeed may often lack an individual personal name. Such is the case with Pangtsen (sPang btsan), literally 'Tsen of the Meadows', who protects the site of a small monastery in eastern Tibet. 112 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET Plate 33 Sipe Gyahno Detail of a thangka (Plate 49), Tibet Photo: Per KVGerne The goddess is depicted on a thangka painted around the middle of this century in eastern Tibet.

In his left hand he holds a red and yellow flag, while he holds the reins of his horse with the other. He has two quivers, one covered by tiger skin and containing arrows, the other covered by leopard skin for his bow. A lu (klu) holding a flower is seen emerging from a pool or lake; the lu are, like their Indian counterparts the nagas, guardians of treasures. Consequently, three precious jewels are likewise seen in the lake. A deer is shown in the bottom right-hand comer. 114 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 NOTES 1 2 3 Karmay 1972: xxi. Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956: 313. Time 1.

NOTES CHAPTER THREE 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR Siddhas, Lamas and Dakinis The Bon religion does not, as has already been pointed out, accept Indian origins for its doctrines and practices. Nevertheless, there are numerous figures which to a large extent correspond to the Indian Buddhist categories of siddhas, 'perfected ones', and the female 4tikinis. As these terms are more or less assimilated into English usage, they can be employed without conhoadicting the Bonpo claim to non-Indian origins. Terms used in Bon texts to designate the siddhas are drubtob shen (gJ;ub thob gshen), 'priests who have attained spiritual perfection', tuwoche (mthu bo che), 'great magicians', and gyerpung (gyer spungs), 'teachers of Bon' -the latter term being in the Zhangzhung language. I shall refer to such figures indiscriminately as 'sages'. The Tibetan term corresponding to Sanskrit 4iikini is khadroma (mkha' 'gro ma, lit. 'sky-walker'), used by Buddhists and Bonpos alike. The Bonpo siddhas are individuals who, through their mastery of esoteric meditational and ritual practices, have acquired spiritual and magical powers far exceeding those of ordinary humans. Some of them are believed to have existed in a distant, indeed mythical, past when they were instrumental in transmitting the teachings of the Tantras to the world of humans, often at the same time subduing certain demons who consequently became Protectors of Bon; others are regarded as human sages, claimed t<;:> have lived in Zhangzhlmg or Tibet in historical times. These siddhas were the priests and advisors of the mighty kings of Zhangzhung as well as Tibet. Only when the kings of Tibet-in particular, Trisong Detsen (Klu:i srong'lde btsan, 742-C.800)-were led astray by tl1e evil doctrine of SakyamUlu . emanating from India, did the influence of the Bonpo sages and priests decline, and with it, the fortunes of Tibet itself, which quickly fell into a state of social anarchy and moral confusion. The siddhas are, however, not just mytl10logical or historical figures. They are also the objects of worship and meditation, and thus they have--like the tutelary deities-their individual, highly symbolical iconography. In fact, some of the siddhas, as for example Takla Mebar, may at times be referred to as a yida111, and Drenpa Namkha may be identified witl1 Kiintu Zangpo (p. 56). The 4tilcinis-whatever their ultimate origins outside the Land of Snow-are the 'fairies'of Tibet. They assume different forms and shapes, appearing as beautiful, smiling damsels, clad only in garlands carved fromhUlnan bones; as old, toothless hags; or as ordinary human women of flesh and blood. Above all, they appear in visions and dreams, but whatever their guise, tl1ey are inspiJ:ators, revealers of hidden treasures and transmitters of secret doctrines. 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"TAKLA MEBAR (Plates 37, 38 and 39) The name Takla Mebar (sTag la me 'bar) alternates with Taklha Mebar (sTag lha me 'bar). The latter variant can be translated as 'Tiger-god, Flaming Fire', which formerly led some scholars to interpret the figure in question as a 'Tiger-god', 'Tiger-devil', or the like.1 It is the form Takla Mebar, however, which would seem to be the more common one, and which will be retained here.2 It is perhaps worth noting that the first element of his name is found in that of a deity reported to possess mediums in Ladald1, viz. Taklha Wangchug (sTag lha dbang phyug).3 The name Talda Mebar is stated by S.G. Karmay to apply to \"two different beings: one is a divinity and the other is a priest\".4Yet the sage TaklaMebar acts as a fierce deity when he subdues his evil twin brother Dharsha Ghriwa,5 killing him by magical means.6 Perhaps Takla Mebar can best be understood as a borderline case between a siddha and a hltelary deity. On the one hand, he is a mythical figure, a disciple of Tonpa Shenrap and famous as a subduer of demons and transmitter of Tantras, especially those focussing on the deity Purpa, the personified magical dagger? On the other hand, he is also worshipped as a hltelary deity, and although invariably portrayed with only one head and two arms, he nevertheless has the fierce appearance and rich symbolism of a tutelary deity. As such he has three aspects: white, black and redi further, he has the epithet putri (spu gri), 'razor', emphasizing his power to destroy obstacles and demons. The invocation translated below was composed by the 11th abbot of the monastery of Menri (sMan ri), Yungdrung Gyaltsen, in 1669:8 The magically-born lord, Takla Mebar-The colour of his body is reddish-black, His three wide-open eyes stare furiously, In his gaping mouth his tongue is curled back while he gnashes his teeth. With his right hand he whirls a golden wheel, With his left, he brandishes nine crossed swords. From the hairs on his body he sends forth A host of shining, fierce deities; His reddish-yellow hair reaches the peak of the created world, With his feet he presses down the deepest hell. His majesty overcomes every single harmful demon. The innumerable host of fierce deities, Guarding all the ten directions, Have wing-feathers of wind, wing-feathers of fire, Wing-jeathers of sharp, crooked knives. In their hands they hold various kinds of weapons. From their mouths resounds a great roar ofBSVO, CHA, and HALA. All the host of obstructive fiends are terrified, And, rendered powerless, flee to the furthest darkness. It is also said that Takla Mebar wears \"the flayed skin of a matang demon9 on the upper part of his body, and on his lower garment consisting of the skin of a valiant tiger, an apron of flashing red lightningi his belt is a venomous snake, his head-117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"ornament is made of dried human skulls and his necldace of still-moist human heads.\"lo SANGWA DUPA (Plate 40) Sangwa Dupa (gSang ba 'dus pa), 'Concentration of Secrets', is a mythical sage believed to have been born as the son of a king of Tazik (sTag gzig), the holy land to the west of Tibet. He received the tantric teachings from Chime Tsukpu (see Chapter One). While Takla Mebar l.mdertook to subdue the 'Female Arrogant Ones' (chief of whom was Sipe Gyalmo, see Chapter Three), Sangwa Dupa brought the 'Male Arrogant Ones' under his sway and compelled them to swear an oath to become 'Protectors of Bon/.ll Sangwa Dupa does not seem to have a fierce form. One of the Six Subduing Shen (see Chapter One) is also called Sangwa Dupa. His appearance is that of a peaceful Enlightened Being, and his colour is normally yellow (alternatively it may be blue). Of the six realms of rebirth, he is associated with that of humans. It is not clear whether he has any connection with the siddha bearing the same name. It is also not clear what relationship, if any, he has to the Buddhist tutelary deity bearing the same name (Sanskrit: Guhyasamaja). ZANGSARINGTSUN (Plate 41) Zangsa Ringtsun (bZang za ring btsun), 'Auspicious Lady, Noble One of Long Life', is a manifestation of Satrig Ersang (see Chapter One). She was born as a semi-divine being in the abode ofthe Thirty-three Gods, situated on the summit of Meru, the mountain forming the centre of our world. Her miraculous appearance is described in the following passage front a Bonpo Tantra, in which her name, too, is explained:12 In the pleasant park with beautiful flowers Of the abode of the Thirty-three Gods, From the essence of the elements of the nine heavens, In the ocean which swirls around the nine continents, A turquoise egg, emitting light, appeared. The egg was pierced by its own inner force, And a beautiful, noble female form appeared, Possessing divine marks and signs, Effulgent with the light of the sun and the rays of the moon, Emitting the five colours of the rainbow in the ten directions. The Supernatural King of Primal Existence Conferred upon that lady a name: This lady, possessing the marks of a deity, Being without passion and greed, Is an auspicious lady (bzang za); Also, since she will remain for a long time As a teacher guiding sentient beings, She is 'the Long(-remaining) (ring), Noble One (btsun)'; Therefore she is called Zangsa Ringtsiin. 118 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Zangsa Ringtsiin is also important because she gives birth to Chime Tsukpii, the teacher of Tantras who in his subsequent birth became the Teacher Shenrap. Her attributes are a golden vase held in her right hand and a golden rosary raised in her left hand, level with her head. (The bronze reproduced on Plate 41 has other attributes, however). DRENPA NAMKHA (Plates 42,43 and 44) Drenpa Namkha (Dran pa nam mkha'), 'Recollection-Sky', is beyond doubt the most important and, in some respects, complex figure in the history of Bon during the reign of the great Tibetan kings. He is, above all, the chief protagonist of Bon during the eighth century in the bitter struggle with the Buddhist faith, introduced into Tibet lmder royal patronage; when Bon finally fell out of favour with the king of Tibet, Drenpa Namkha allowed himself to be converted to the new faith. According to the historical tradition of the Bonpos, he did so with an impressive gesture: he cut off his hair himself, in imitation of Buddha Sakyamuni, and then proceeded to ordain himself, scornfully refusing the assistance of the Buddhist monks and justifying his action by stating that Bon and Buddhism are distinct only on the plane of relative truth.13 There can be little doubt as to the historical reality of Drenpa Namld1a. He is also mentioned in Buddhistsources.14 His family name is Khopung (Khod spungs), and he is often referred to simply as lachen (bla chen), 'the Great Lama (i.e. Preceptor)\" or, with a Zhangzhung term, gyerpung (gyer spungs), 'Teacher of Bon'. According to the tradition of Bon, Drenpa Namkha is the father of another important sage, Tsewang Rigzin (Tshe dbang rig' dzin), to whom he transmitted Tantric teach-ings.15 In addition, a strong (but not universally accepted) tradition asserts that Drenpa Namkha was also the father of Padmasambhava.16 Bonpo histories maintain that Drenpa Namkha was active during the reign of King Mutri Tsenpo (Mu khri btsan po), the son of the first king of Tibet, Nyatri Tsenpo (gNya' klwi btsan po). Having obtained the power of extending his life-spanbeyond normal human limits, he was able to ensure, many cenhlri es later, that the sacred texts of Bon were hidden away when Bon was suppressed by King Trisong Detsen (Khri srong Ide btsan) in the eighth century. At this time he prophesied that the texts would be rediscovered as 'treasures', terma (gter ma), by specially chosen individuals at appropriate times in the future. As the siddhn chIefly responsible for hiding 'treasures', Drenpa Namkha clearly has traits in common with the Buddhist-and, more specifcally, Nyingmapa-figure Padmasambhava, and-again like Padmasambhava-he became the object of a cult. There exists a vast literature in Tibet related to Drenpa NamkhaF including a biography in eight volumes brought to light by the 'treasure-discov-erer' Sangngak Lingpa (gSang sngags gling pa, b. 1864), a native of Nyarohg.18 There are various manifestations of Drenpa Namlilla. He may be portrayed in a tranquil form, seated in the posture of meditation and wearing the robes of c, monk; more often, he sits in a relaxed posture, richly attired and holding his characteristic attributes, a staff surmOlmted by a swastika in his right hand a~d a skull/cup in his left. He also has a wrathful form in which he manifests himself as a yidam embraced by his consort (as on Plate 29); in this form, too, he can be identified by the attributes mentioned above. SIDDHAS, LAMAS AND DAKINIS 119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"TSEWANG RIGZIN As we have seen, Tsewang Rigzin (Tshe dbang rig' dzin), 'Knowledge-holder, Master of Long Life', is believed to be the son of Drenpa N aIhkha, and is regarded as a manifestation of Sangwa Diipa.19 His teachings, rituals and iconographic representations are grouped in three different traditions: 'According to the Tradi-tion of Zhangzhung', Zhangzhungma (Zhang zhung ma), 'According to the Tradition of India', Gyagarma (rGya gar ma), and' According to the TraditionofTibet',p!'jyiilma (Bod yul ma). Tsewang Rigzin is portrayed seated in a relaxed posture, holding a flaming jewel in his right hand and a skull bowl in his left hand. He is flanked by his consort, Nyima Wobar (Nyi rna 'od 'bar), 'Light-radiating Still', who holds a chopper in her right hand and a skull bowl in her left.2o LISHU TARING (Plates 45 and 46) Another siddha, a contemporary of Drenpa Namkha, is Nyachen Lishu Taring (sNya chen Li shu stag ring). Like other sages, he is believed to have been able to extend his life-span by supernatural means, and thus remain in the human world for more than two thousand years. He is said to have gone to Zhangzhung as well as to Tazik several times in order to obtain sacred texts, which he translated into Tibetan. When Bon was proscribed in Tibet by king Trisong Detsen, he left the country, but not before he had cursed the king and prophesied the ruin of the dynasty and of Tibet. Like Drenpa Namkha, Lishu Taring also concealed sacred texts for the benefit of future generations. According to the chronological calcula-tions of the Bonpo scholar Nyima Tenzin (Nyi rna bstan I dzin, b. 1813), this event took place in 749.21 In the same way as Drenpa Namkha and other sages, he may be portrayed either alone or together with his consort, the 4alcini Nyibarma (Nyi 'bar ma)22, and he has a tranquil as well as a wrathful mode of manifestation. A great number of other siddhas are to be found in the iconographic heritage of Bon. As in Tibetan Buddhist art, they may be shown in various postures of yoga, but also seated tranquilly in meditation, or in the act of performing rites of tantric magic (Plate 47). DAKINIS (Plate 48) There are numerous 4alcinis. In spite of their semi-divine nature, most of them manifest themselves inhuman form as beautiful young women, usually portrayed in dancing postures. However, historical figures may also be regarded as 4iilcinis. Such female sages and magicians are particularly powerful, fully endowed with all kinds of superhuman capacities. Frequently they are the consorts of male siddhas, but some women have an independent and highly respected status. Thus Chosa BOlTIno (Co za bon rna), who lived in the eighth century, \"tied three knots in a sword\", and at one point during the religious struggles during the reign of King Trisong Detsen, it was she who was appointed by the king to attempt to achieve a reconciliation with the Bonpo priests.23 120 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Plate 37 Takla Mebar Tibet Photo: Tenzin Wangyal Takla Mebar is standing in the usual posture of a fierce deity, with one leg bent and the other stretched out.

In this bronze, the two attributes give the impression of being more recent than the actual body of the statue, and may have been added as replacements of the originals. The colour of the face and the nine swords has been added later. LAMAS (Plate 49) Many thangkas include monks, yogins or other religious personages. Occasionally they are shown as numerous figures, representing the entire lineage of transmis-sion of certain teachings (Plates 12, 16 and 18). More often, however, a single or a small number of monks (sometimes flanked by laymen and laywomen) occupy a more subordinate position, for example one part of the bottom row (Plates 8, 9, 26, 27,31 and 38). In this case, they may be regarded as the monks who commissioned or consecrated the thangka. In other cases (Plates 28, 30 and 39), a deity is flanked by two or more monks, who have a particularly close relationship to the deity in question, or who are generally revered as teachers or founders of monasteries. A few thangkas have a single monk as the central figure (Plate 49, d. also Plate 50), usually surrounded by other, smaller figures of monks belonging to the same spiritual lineage or succession of abbots, as the case may be. Bonpo monks can generally be recognized by the characteristic 'lotus hat', pesha (pad zhva) and other articles of dress and equipment mentioned in connection with Tritsug Gyalwa (Chapter One).

CHAPTER FIVE Narrative Thangkas In the traditional society of Tibet, illiteracy was widespread. This does not, however, mean that ordinary Tibetans were cut off from acquiring a broad knowledge of their cultural and religious heritage. One of the mediums through which such knowledge was transmitted, was-and still is-visual art: temple frescoes, illuminated manuscripts, block-prints, thangkas and statues. A special type of thangkas are paintings which depict a continuous story. The pedagogical function of such thangkas is obvious. In Buddhist art, the former lives of Buddha Sakyamuni are a favourite theme, as well as the lives of saints such as Padmasambhava, Milarepa, Tsongkhapa and others. An entire story or biography may be contained within a single thangka, or unfold through a series of thangkas forming a set. The visual representation is often based on a specific literary text, and mayor may not have explanatory captions. The scenes may be strictly organized within boxes (as in a Western comic-strip), or distributed on the surface of the thangka in a less rigid fashion.

I was informed that it had been commissioned by one of the Bonpo ku,gs of Gyarong in the eighteenth century; this would imply that it dates from before the devastating Chinese campaign of 1771-76. In the course ofthis campaign, imperial armies, after overcoming fierce resistance, brought Gyarong under Chil,ese rule, extu,guishing the remarkable culture that flourished there in the eighteenth century.4 The first thangka of the set (Plate 51) illustrates the birth of Tonpa Shemap and his early years as pruLCe in the kil,gdom ofWolmo Lungring.5 Among the scenes depicted on this thangka, several can be clearly identified. In the upper left-hand corner, the future Teacher of the World, the divu,e youth Chime Tsukpii, requests the blessu,gs of ShenTha Wokar and Sangpo Bumtri before being reborn among humans U, the land of Wolmo Lungrulg. In the centre of the upper part of the thangka he is seen descending tlwough the upper atmospheric realms, sur-rowlded by gods, before reaching the surrunit of Mount Meru, the mountau,in the centre of our world. He continues his descent to the soufuern slope of the mountain, where he takes the form of the god Tamdin (Sanskrit Hayagriva), the 'Horse-necked One', and forces the gods and titans to swear to protect the teachings of Bon. This is shown below and slightly to tlle left of the fonner scene. In the upper right-hand corner can be seen the palace of the ku,g and queen of Wolmo Lw,gring. In a small room to the right can be seen the birth of the Teacher, while in the central part of the palace he is subsequently presented to the kUlg while brahmu,s, seated U, the courtyard in front, give the prulce a name. In the lower, left-hand section of the thangka the PruLCe of Demons, who is to remau, the arch-rival of Tonpa Shemap tlwoughout the greater part of the life of the latter, attacks the young prince and his companions while they are playing in . the forest and enjoying (as the Ziji informs us) fruit, milk and beer.

Not all of Tonpa Shemap's offspring were, however, devoted to religious pursuits. One of his daughters, Shenza Nechung (gShen bza' Ne'u chung), had a fickle and frivolous mind, and the Prince of Demons, Khyappa Laring, in the guise of a young and handsome prince, was able to seduce her. No sooner had she consented, however, than she was carried off to the 'Land of Darkness' of the demons and kept prisoner in the 'Iron Castle with a Hundred Doors'. Here she gave birth to twin sons, Tabutung (sTag bu thung) and Zibutung (gZig bu thung),8 whose fierce and violent nature fully testified to their partly demonic parentage. Plate 55 shows the castle of the demons, decorated with skulls and guarded by armed demons keeping watch from every tower. Inside, we see the demonic twins in various scenes with their parents; they are so fierce that to keep them from tearing their mother apart, they have to be kept in chains. Tonpa Shemap, however, hears the pitiful cries of his daughter, and flying through the air, lands in front of the gate of the castle. At first he is refused entry, but finally the Prince of Demons allows Shenza Nechung to come out to meet her father, but only on condition that she remains chained to the castle. Using his irresistible magic power, Tonpa Shemap nevertheless enters the castle, the chains are loosened, and Shenza Nechung and her sons are safely extracted from the clutches of the demons and 138 THE BON RELIGION OF TIBET Plate 52"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Plate 53 Plate 54 Plate 55 NARRATIVE THANGKAS 139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Plate 56 Plate 57 entrusted to one of the Teacher's chief disciples, who is given the task of imparting to them spiritual instruction.

After many years of ceaseless activity for the welfare of sentient beings, the Teacher decides to renounce worldy life and to take the vows of a monk. Having removed his crown, jewels and royal attire, the five objects which a monk is permitted to own (staff, razor, needle, jar and alms-bowl), as well as the robes and 'lotus-hat' of a monk, descend from heaven (Plate 56, upper part).9 Exhorting his disciples to follow his example and take monastic vows, the Teacher shakes his body thrice and the robes are transformed into the wings of a shangshang, a creature which is half bird, half human, and soars up to the Womin ('Og min) heaven where he is respectfully received by the divine inhabitants (Plate 58).1Â° By means of consecrated water he is purified (Plate 56, lower part) and given the name Tritsug Gyalwa (see Chapter One).

NARRATIVE THANGKAS 141 ~------------ ------------------------------------I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Plate 60 142"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX The Wheel of Existence One of the standard subjects of Tibetan Buddhist iconography is the 'Wheel of Existence' (Sanskrit bhavacalcra) illustrating the six realms of birth, death and rebirth of sentient beings. The Bonpos, too, have their own version of the 'Wheel of Existence'. Compared to the Buddhist bhavacalcra, the basic lay-out of the Bonpo version is the familiar one, but numerous details differ. The Bonpo version thus provides a good example of the way in which Bon assimilates elements which are present in Tibetan culture as a whole, while retaining a considerable degree of freedom in utilising these elements according to its own religious concepts. The origin of the Bonpo pictorial representation of the 'Wheel of J;xistence' supports this view. The painting reproduced here (Plate 60) was made in 1973 by the only Bonpo artist active in India at the time. It conforms to a short anonymous text, translated below, containing an explanation of the painting, Contemporary Tibetan Bonpo scholars affirm that it was only in the present century that the Bonpos actually created a pictorial 'Wheel of Existence' of their own; previously they simply used the Buddhist version. The elements constituting the Bonpo version are, however, found in the Bonpo Kanjur and are quoted in the text translated below. Thus the painting, based as it is on a Buddhist prototype-but only to the extent that scriptural justification can be found within the Bonpo religion itself-illustrates the characteristic faithfulness of Bon to its own scrip-tures and inner coherency, as well as its ability to assimilate new elen1ents. According to the text, the scriptural basis of the painting is chiefly to be found in three sources, the DZQ (mDzod), the Trije Lungten (Khri rje lung bstan) and the Ziji (gZi brjid). The DZQ is quoted three times (and its commentary, the Dradrel (sGra 'grel), once); this is not surprising, as this text has a special status in Bon, being the basic systematic exposition of the various elements of the doctrine and placed as the second text ofthe Bonpo Kanjur. It was discovered as a 'treasure' on a leastthree different occasions in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.! The Trije Lungten is a short text classed as a sutra; it, too, is a 'treasure' from the eleventh century.2 The Zijiis the extended biography ofTonpa Shenrap in twelve volumes; itis a 'mentally revealed treasure', gongter (dgongs gter), from the fourteenth century.3 The text deals in turn with the three concentric circles of the 'Wheel of Existence', starting with the innermost one. Here we find not the familiar three animals of the Buddhist version, pig, cock and snake, but a single monstrous beast having the body of a cow, the tail of a snake and three heads: that of a cock, a pig and a snake. However, ample textual justification is adduced for this hybrid creahlre. The text quotes the eighth chapter of the DZQ which deals with the arising of the Three Poisons: the 'poison cow of saJJ1stira' has three heads symbolizing the Three Poisons; from each of the three mouths proceed three classes of beings, nine 143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"in all, ranging from gods to the denizens of hell. In the Ziji the same image of the cow is found in chapter 31; here it forms a part of a larger cosmological account of a kind familiar in Tibet, involving a 'white' and a 'black' light, a cosmic egg, etc. Part of this account is quoted by our text. The cow appears in this context as a demiurgic figure of a kind eXhÂ·emely common in Tibetan mythology, i.e. a being from whose body the world, or a significant part or aspect of the world, emanates. Besides lu (klu) and demons, sinpo (srin po), various animals are known to have such a function, e.g. the tiger, the toad, or-coming closer to the present image-the yak.4 The second circle shows, as one would expect, the six reahns of existence. One may note that the upward and downward movement of beings, usually shown immediately next to the circle in the middle in the Buddhist 'Wheel of Existence', is missing in the painting as well as in the text, although it is hinted at in the Trije Lungten in a way that could have justified its inclusion. The painting, on the other hand, shows the Six Disciplining Shen, Dillwe Shen Drug ('Dul ba'i gshen drug), one in each of the six realms of existence (see Chapter One). Although the text does not mention them, scriptural justification could easily have been found. Further we may note that the torments of hell are sharply divided into hot and cold, the otherwise familiar scenes of mutilation being absent: 110r do we find the scene showing the judgement of the dead, which, it would seem, is never missing from the Buddhist 'Wheel of Existence'. In the lower part of the world of humans are seen three individuals clothed in leaves and having animal heads; they represent a class of semi-divine, semi-demoniacal beings known as miamci.5 The outer circle shows the twelve links in the chain of dependent origination. The first is in the upper right-hand sector of the circle, and the subsequent ones follow in clockwise sequence (not, it may be noted in passing, counter-clockwise as one might have expected in a Bonpo painting). This is in accordance with the usual Buddhist pattem, although one frequently also finds the first link (Sanskrit nidana) in the lower left-hand sector. A number of the links are illustrated in ways which are entirely different from those usually found in the Buddhist 'Wheel of Existence'. Withoutente ring into the question of how tllese differences have arisen, it may nevertheless be of interest to quote the brief remarks concerning the representation, pe (dpe), of eaclliink found ill the commentary Dradrel: 1 Ignorance is shown as an old blind woman, as ill Buddhist tradition. \"It is like a blind old woman erring about, unable to see the path\". 2 Predispositions are represented by a potter at work. \"Material, tools and agent-these three beillg gathered together, perform\". 3 Consciousness is a monkey climbing a hÂ·ee. \"Abandoning one sense-object or body, it grasps another\". The first three links follow the conventions of the Buddhist 'Wheel of Exist-ence'. In tlle remaining sectors, however, the scenes depicted are generally completely different from those found in Buddlust versions. 4 Name-and-form is represented by a pile of goods: tlle Buddhist symbol is a man being ferried across a river. \"Name enjoys forin as a lord enjoys his possessions\" . 5 The six sense-fields are represented by a mask of a human face. In Buddhist versions one finds an empty house or a group of houses.

Usually a man and a woman embracing are shown. \"The sense~objects are like a snake; being of exactly the same size, they meet together (i.e. fit into each other)\". 7 Sensation is illustrated by water being poured from a jar on red-hot iron. In Buddhist versions a man with an arrow in his eye is invariably shown. \"His like water being sprinkled on blazing red-hot iron\". 8 Craving is symbolized by a man unable to find the door of a house. h1 the Buddhist 'Wheel of Existence' one always finds a picture of a man drinking or being served beer. \"For example-like a prince who, not finding the door of his palace, wishes (to find) the door of his palace\". 9 Grasping is symbolized by a turkey7 drinking water. The Buddhist version shows the picking of fruit, usually by a monkey, but also by people; sometimes the monkey hands fruit to one or several persons standing at the foot of a tree. \"As for the turkey drinking water-it is like taking water in close succession at every moment\". 10 Existence is represented by a man and a woman in union. This may also be found in Buddhist versions, but more frequently they show a pregnant woman. \"Male and female being the cause, they are taken as illustration\". 11 Birth is shown by an image in the process of being cast. Buddhist paintings show a woman giving birth. \"As for birth, the substance itself becoming manifest, it is like liquid stone being founded and becoming manifest as form\". 12 Old age and death are illustrated as an old man and a naked corpse, \"without the use of symbolism\". In Buddhist versions, only a corpse is shown, wrapped up and being carried off by one or several men. Now follows the translation of the short anonymous text referred to above.s \"An Illuminating Explanation of Phenomenal Existence in its Evolution and its Extinction. Obeisance to the supreme Teacher Shenrap who, by means of the rays of Wisdom from the sun of the Mind-of-Enlightenment, imparts the instruction which utterly dries up the expanse of the ocean of suffering which is incomprehen-sible to the mind! Phenomenal existence in its evolution produces only suffering; by the extinc-tion thereof the state of liberation is obtained. Explaining the nature of Suchness, joy greatly increases in my mind.9 In this connection, there follows a brief explanation, based on the substance of the Scriptures, of the pichue showing the round of birth and death as comprised by the twelve links of dependent origination, and a more detailed accOlmt of what the picture looks like. First of all, the DZQ says:lO \"Sa~sara, a poison cow, arose\", and its commentary, the Dradrel, says:ll\" As for 'poison', it destroys the splendour of Knowledge and the flow of Bliss; as for 'cow' (ba-rna), ba means the expanse of the Three Realms, rna ('female') means 'the place where suffering arises'.
