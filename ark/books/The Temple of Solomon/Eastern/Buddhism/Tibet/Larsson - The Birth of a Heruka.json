variety of ways to the completion of this dissertation. Some have provided it with inspiration, heart and soul; others have given more substantial help, such as checking my translations, pointing _out shortcomings or giving me concrete advice that has directly affected the dissertation. Still others have given me the financial and practi-cal support that has enabled me to continue the arduous task that writing a dissertation inevitably is. The inspiration, heart and soul of this study mainly come from Lama Ngawang, an old Tibetan lama who lives in Sweden. If I had not met this humorous, enigmatic, wise and compassionate person more than twenty years ago I would never have written this dissertation. Lama Ngawang en-joyed telling stories about 'Brug pa kun legs and A khu ston pa, and he often watched videos and dvds about the mad Chinese monk Ji gong.' Lama Nga-wang not only introduced me to the mad yogins of Tibet, but his unpredict-able and spontaneous behavior has given me a vague hint of what the \"disci-plined conduct\" of gTsang smyon might have been like. When it comes to the more concrete activity of writing the dissertation I would first of all like to acknowledge my supervisor, Per-Arne Berglie, who has patiently guided me along the way. Without his knowledge, support and assistance I would never have managed to complete this dissertation. Not to forget is my assistant supervisor Erik af Edholm, who also provided me with invaluable help and guidance. Countless thanks are due to Kurtis R. Schaeffer who has helped me more than I can possibly thank him for. During the semester I spent at the Univer-sity of Virginia he gave me much important advice and substantial help: he provided me with Tibetan texts, unpublished articles, translation help, and so forth. Moreover he kindly agreed to be an external reader of my dissertation, and his advice was absolutely crucial when finalizing the text. When it comes to the arduous task of reading and translating Tibetan texts I would first of all give my warmest and sincerest thanks to Kelsang Dam-cho, a Tibetan from Amdo who thanks to lucky coincidence happened to come to Sweden shortly before I started my research. With the help of Kel-sang I translated the main sources of the dissertation. I also spent a week in 1 Lama Ngawang is old and infirm nowadays and it has been several years since I heard him tell these stories. However, he still watches videos of Ji gong from time to time. xi"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Budapest studying the life stories together with Khenpo Acharya Chogyel Tenzin. Besides sharing his learning with me, he treated me like a family member, although we had never met before, and for this I feel privileged and happy. During my time as a Ph.D. candidate, I also received important help with reading Tibetan and Sanskrit texts from my advisor Per-Arne Berglie and from Urban Hammar. While I was in Virginia, the Tibetan scholar Khenpo Ngawang Dorje checked translations that are crucial for this disser-tation: I have also received some translation help from Khenpo Tsering Samdrub when he visited Sweden in 2004. Moreover, I have benefited from reading some sections of the life stories with Lama Tsultrim Rinpoche, who moved to Sweden during the course of my studies. Many thanks are due to Alexandru Anton-Luca, Franz-Karl Ehrhard and E. Gene Smith who helped me to obtain some of the rare texts that constitute the main sources of the dissertation. Franz-Karl also sent me several of his articles before their publication. The Italian scholars Marta Sernesi and Mi-chela Clemente both work with material closely related to my own and have generously shared their articles and learning with me. Marta also sent me her dissertation for which I am grateful. Many thanks are also due to Peter Alan Roberts for sending me his dissertation on Rechungpa before it was pub-lished, and to Christian K. Wedemeyer for sending me a chapter of his book before it was published, and to Kristin Blancke for sending her unpublished article on gTsang smyon. Mats Lindberg, Marta Sernesi and Andrew Quintman have read some sec-tions of my dissertation, and their expertise and valuable suggestions helped to improve these sections in important ways. Their comments also provided me with important general insights into gTsang smyon and his tradition. Moreover Karl Meinke read through large parts of the dissertation and helped me to improve the English. The final English proofreading was car-ried out by Everett Thiele. I would also like to take the opportunity to give warm thanks to the fac-ulty, staff, and members of the higher seminar at History of Religions, Stockholm University. Extra thanks are due to Niklas Foxeus and Maija-Liisa Keinanen for providing me with important advice at the final stages of writing the dissertation; and to Urban Hammar and Pavel Volf for help at an earlier stage of the work. Not to forget are Hedvig Egero and Rostam Zandi who helped me with the map--thanks. The Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education (STINT) gave me a generous scholarship that enabled me to spend one semester at the University of Virginia (Spring Semester 2007). I benefited greatly from this stay, and I would like to take the opportunity to express my gratitude to the teachers, staff, faculty, librarians and graduate students that I met there.

A trip to Tibet in May 2006 was made possible due to a generous grant from Margot och Rune Johanssons stiftelse. I also received three other lib-eral grants from this foundation for which I am grateful. During my three weeks in Tibet I received information and took photos that have been incor-porated into the dissertation. Revisiting Tibet after eighteen years was very valuable, and seeing some of the places that I have read so much about brought life into the dissertation. In Tibet I met many kind and helpful peo-ple who generously shared their knowledge with me. In Rechung phug I even met with gTsang smyon himself, in the form of a recently made statue. I also received textual transmission (lung) of a text that belongs to gTsang smyon's lineage (the Aural Transmission). In Gyantse, the place of gTsang smyon's birth, I also met kind monks who guided me to a cave and a well that had been blessed by gTsang smyon. They also showed me his shoe and brought me to a place where an emanation of gTsang smyon passed away a few years ago. It was a happy surprise to see that the memory of gTsang smyon is still kept alive in Tibet despite the many difficulties the Tibetan people have gone through. To the many helpful Tibetans in Tibet I would like to give my heartfelt thanks. I have also received a grant from Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse that enabled me to visit the 11th Seminar of the International Association for Tibetan Studies conference in Bonn 2006. I have saved for last those most deserving my gratitude. Without the the support, patience and love that I have received from my family over the years I would never have finished this project. During my time as a Ph.D. candidate I have traveled to several countries and have often been far away, sometimes bodily and often in thoughts. Despite this I have always felt the closeness, love and support from my wife, Maria Kristensson, from my two sons, Joel and Love, from my sister Lena Larsson, and fi·om my mother and father Birgitta and Lennart Larsson. My parents supported me both finan-cially (when I was in Tibet and Virginia) and practically (e.g. babysitting), and my wife took sole responsibility for our sons while I was in Tibet and Virginia. It amazes me to think about how lucky I have been to have met with all these people who have generously assisted me and shared their knowledge. If this work contains any merits it is because of their kind assistance and contributions. Needless to say, the shortcomings are entirely mine. Finally, I would like to offer many apologies to those whom I have forgotten to men-tion. xiii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Abbreviations G L N NGMPP T TBRC xiv rGod tshang ras pa sna tshogs rang grol. 1969 [1512]. gTsang smyon hem kaphyogs thams cad las rnam par rgyal ba 'i rnam thar rdo rje theg pa 'i gsa! byed nyi rna 'i snying po.

As is customary in academic writings dealing with Tibetan religion, history and culture, I have chosen to write words as they are spelled and not as they are pronounced. To write a word only as it is pronounced, without spelling it according to convention, is to transcribe a sound and not to specify a word. The words thus become devoid of meaning and you can not look them up in a dictionary.

According to the life stories written about him by his disciples, gTsang smyon claimed that he practised tantric Buddhism and followed in the footsteps of the Indian Buddhist siddhas when he acted in unusual and seemingly mad ways. This claim will be examined in this study. It will be investigated how the \"madness\" of gTsang smyon relates to Indian Buddhist tantric practice, and how and why the young monk Sangs rgyas rgyal mtshan was transformed into a heruka. It was after this transformation that he received his sobriquet gTsang smyon Heruka (the Madman of gTsang: the Heruka). Heruka is a generic name for a type of wrathful male tantric deities of central importance in the higher Buddhist tantras, and its meaning will be described more thoroughly during the course of the study.2 According to the life stories, gTsang smyon saw himself as a heruka, and others also perceived him as such. gTsang smyon is famous for having compiled the life story and song col-lection of Tibet's most well-known ascetic, the yogin Milarepa (Mila ras pa, 1052-1135).3 The latter work, The Hundred Thousand Songs of Mi/w·epa, contains a song about madness/craziness and this song will introduce the main topics of the study. Before citing a section of the song, its setting will be given. Milarepa Meets Dam pa Sangs rgyas Once upon a time the Tibetan yogin Milarepa met the Indian siddha Dam pa Sangs rgyas (d. 1117?). When two great masters such as these encountered one another it was customary to test one another in various ways. It was also common that they sang tantric songs. Dam pa Sangs rgyas sang a song in which he explained the Pacification of Suffering-doctrine (sdug bsngal zhi byed), of which he was a lineage-holder. Milarepa listened to this song with great delight as he sat to one side with his penis freely exposed. Dhampa Sangje [Dam pa Sangs rgyas] remarked, \"You 2 See especially Chapter 8. 3 Since the name Milarepa is widely known in its pronounced form I have chosen to write it as pronounced. 2"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"are like a lunatic who neglects to cover up the place that should be covered. In reply, the jetsun sang \"The Song of a Lunatic\": To all Gurus I pay my homage. I take refuge in the Gracious One, I pray you, dispel my hindrances; Bring me to the right Path, I pray. Men say, \"Is not Milarepa mad?\" I also think it may be so. Now listen to my madness. The father and the son are mad, And so are the Transmission And Dorje-Chang's Succession. Mad too were my Great-grandfather, the Fair Sage, Tilopa, And my Grandfather, Naropa the great scholar. Mad, too, was my Father, Marpa the translator; So too is Milarepa.

The Buddhist monk is generally presented as the Buddhist ideal, and we are often told that it is the monk that is best suited to progress on the Buddhist path towards enlightenment.

This alternative version is included in another collection compiled by gTsang srnyon 's disciple Lha btsun rin chen marn rgyal (1473-1557) and it is similar but shorter. An English translation of this version of the song is included in Kunga and Cutillo 1978: 85-89, and also in Steams 1980: 154-156. For the Tibetan text, see Lha btsun Rin chen marn rgyal 1985: 211-216. A somewhat similar song, ascribed to Ko brag pa bSod narns rgyal rntshan (Ko brag pa, 117Q-1249), is found in Ko brag pa's song collection, which Lha btsun Rin chen marn rgyal also compiled. For an English translation of the song (as well as the Tibetan text), see Steams 2000: 46-51. 6 The alternative spelling dkar brgyud (\"white lineage\") is sometimes encountered in the sources. This name refers to the white cotton clothes (ras) that some of the bKa' brgyud yo gins wore. Several of the early 'Brug pa bka' brgyud masters were ras pas, for example, gLing ras pa, Lo ras pa and gTsang pa rGya ras. Moreover, Milarepa (Mi Ia ras pa), Ras chung and rGod tshang ras pa were ras pas. 7 I will write Marpa instead of Mar pa to make the dissertation more readable. 8 Shangs pa bKa' brgyud is an additional bKa' brgyud tradition that is not counted among the four greater and eight lesser bKa' brgyud schools; it was founded by rnKhas grub Khyung po mal 'byor (1002-1064). The four greater and eight lesser bKa' brgyud traditions are enumer-ated in, for example, Smith 200 I: 41-46. 9 It should be noted that mad masters exist in other traditions of Tibetan Buddhism too. 4"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"bacy, and abstain from alcohol and so forth; many rules govern the life of the lay and ordained practitioner alike. The Buddhist path to awakening is often portrayed as being characterized by self-discipline, peaceful behavior, and calm deportment in general. gTsang smyon and the other mad yogins of Tibet are interesting because they challenge this picture of Buddhism. The mad yogin often had long hair, he (or occasionally she) generally did not live in celibacy, he sometimes drank alcohol, and as we will see, repeatedly behaved in provocative and seemingly crazy ways. The looks and behavior of the mad yo gins are thus in sharp contrast to those of the Buddhist monks. It would, however, be a mistake to see the mad yogins' behavior as uncon-trolled or undisciplined; their conduct is better understood as another type of discipline. The mad yogins represent a side of Buddhism that is not that well-known, a side that seems to have existed long before Buddhism came to Tibet. Since similar figures exist in many religions, the mad yogins of Tibet exemplify a wider religious phenomenon, and studying them can therefore broaden our picture, not only of Buddhism, but also of religion in general.10 The main sources of this study are three life stories (rnam thar) that gTsang smyon's disciples wrote about him.\" rGod tshang ras pa sNa thogs rang grol ( 1482-1559) composed a text named Heart of the Sun; Lha btsun Rin chen mam rgyal ( 14 73-1557), a text called the L~fe Story which Causes the Body-Hairs of the Faithful to Flutter; and finally, dNgos grub dpal 'bar (ca. 1460?-?), a text titled Lion of Faith.12 Based on the contents of these three texts, gTsang smyon 's life could roughly be divided into three periods: I. The formative period: birth, childhood and early life, lasting until his early twenties. During this time he became a monk, met his main teacher, received teachings and empowerments (dbang, abhi-$ekha)13 and studied in a monastery. 1° For some examples of similar figures in other religions, see, for example, Dahlen 2002; Feuerstein 2006; Thompson 1987. 11 I will alternatively refer to these types of texts as life stories, hagiographies, biographies and rnam thar. 12 These are abbreviated forms of the titles. For the full titles in Tibetan, see the Bibliogra-phy. The three authors of the life stories will frequently be referred to by using the first part of their names. Hence, rGod tshang ras pa sNa tshogs rang grol will be referred to as \"rGod tshang ras pa\", and Lha btsun Rin chen rnam rgyal as \"Lha btsun\" dNgos grub dpal 'bar has a rather short name and no abbreviation will be used for him. When referring to the three main sources in the footnotes I will use the letter \"G\" for the life story that rGod tshang ras pa wrote, the letter \"L\" for the the life story that Lha btsun wrote, and the letter \"N\" for the life story that dNgos grub dpal 'bar wrote. The three sources will be described in more detail in Chapter 2. 13 Tibetan and Sanskrit words will sometimes be included in parentheses. When both Tibetan and Sanskrit terms are provided, the Tibetan term generally comes first. 5"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"2.

A Summary of the Life of gTsang smyon Heruka according to the Hagiographies gTsang smyon was born 1452 in gTsang, the western part of Central Tibet.15 According to the hagiographies, gTsang smyon's birth and childhood were marked by extraordinary events. When he was seven or eight years old, a strong disgust towards cyclic existence and an unbearable compassion for the beings who suffer therein arose; he became a monk and received the ordination name Sangs rgyas rgyal mtshan.16 As a young monk,.he became famous for his great emphasis on discipline, and it is mentioned that he took poison rather than impinge on his monk vows. Studying many siitras he soon became well-known for his capacity· to remember and recite texts by heart. At that time, he had several dreams and visions urging him to leave his home, and when he was eighteen, he man-aged to do so. During a trip to the holy pilgrimage place of Tsari,17 he met his \"root lama\" (rtsa ba 'i bla ma), Sha ra rab 'byams pa Sangs rgyas seng ge (1427-1470), from whom he received many teachings and empowerments. After having completed his studies and performed meditation under his guru's guidance, gTsang smyon studied in the famous dPal 'khor chos sde monastery in rGyal rtse (Gyantse) not far from his birthplace for three or 14 \"Disciplined conduct\" is a key concept that will be frequently encountered in the disserta-tion.

He also became learned in many tantras and their Indian and Tibetan com-mentaries, Hevajra Tantra in particular. gTsang smyon's achml debut as a mad yogin occurred when his monas-tery was being visited by especially prominent and important guests. On this occasion, he behaved in a very insulting and crazy manner that forced the master of studies (slob dpon) of the monastery to rebuke him. After this incident, the twenty-one-year-old gTsang smyon left his monas-tery and became a wandering yogin with no fixed abode. Abandoning not only his monastery but also his monk vows, he started to follow another kind of discipline, called \"disciplined conduct\" (brtul zhugs) in the hagiographies. His famous sobriquet \"the Madman of gTsang\"-gTsang smyon-was given to him soon after he had left his monastery by some people of Tsari. This important event is described in the following way in the Heart of the Sun: Having thought extensively about how to benefit the Buddhist doctrine and living beings, he went to a very great gathering in Tsari. His body was naked, soiled with ashes from corpses, spotted with blood, and smeared with fat. He made a necklace and ornaments for his feet and hands [using] the intestines of a dead man's body. He cut off the fingers and toes, tied them together with a thread of muscle fibres and bound his hair with it. A person offered him an incomplete set of thin bone ornaments which he wore on his body. Some-times he laughed and sometimes he cried. In particular, he carried out various kinds of outrageous behavior in the market place. Even though the conduct of the people of Tsari was very rough [gTsang smyon's] compassion brought them under his control, and they were subdued by his power. They revered him very much and agreed to call him the Mad-man of gTsang. Then he became as famous as the sun and the moon in all di-rections.19 For the remaining thirty-plus years of his life, gTsang smyon never settled anywhere permanently. He wandered between different holy places, and though he might stay in one place for years to meditate, he always continued his travels. gTsang smyon's favorite places to meditate were three locales connected with the tantric deity Cakrasa1pvara: Tsari in Southeastern Tibet; La phyi in Southern Tibet close to the Nepalese border; and Kailasa in Southwestern Tibet. In these places he stayed many times, often for several years, to meditate. gTsang smyon also went to other holy places, and he of-ten walked in the footsteps of his great role model: Milarepa. Milarepa had meditated in La phyi and Ti se (Kailasa)20 but also in many other remote 18 The sources give different accounts of how long he stayed. 19 G: 37-38. For the Tibetan text, see Appendix I.

Furthermore, he went to Lhasa a couple of times and visited Kathmandu three times. He also visited gLo (Mustang), in present day Nepal close to the Tibetan border, three times. gTsang smyon gradually became famous and gained supporters and disci-ples. Many of the leaders ofthe areas he visited became his benefactors and devotees. The network of people who supported him eventually enabled him to accomplish several of the works for which he became famous. In his late twenties, he had a visionary encounter with the tantric deity, Hevajra who encouraged him to write texts. After that, he wrote a ritual text about Hevajra. It was also in his late twenties that he started to attract disci-ples and sing spiritual songs (mgur). He continued to compose texts and sing spiritual songs from time to time, and when he was in his late thirties, during a three-year stay in La phyi, his most important literary works-the hagiography and song collection of Mi-larepa-were completed. These works became widely disseminated and were also accepted as authoritative by the different Tibetan Buddhist tradi-tions. The importance of this enterprise can hardly be overestimated. gTsang smyon' s versions of the L~fe and the Songs of M ilarepa are among the most widely read Tibetan texts ever written, and both texts have been translated into numerous languages. gTsang smyon was a pioneer in using the rela-tively new wood-block-printing technique, and this enabled him to make many copies of his works and to disseminate them all over Tibet. Besides being one of Tibet's greatest authors, he was thus a key figure in the history of printing in the country. Having completed his works on Milarepa, gTsang smyon continued to wander. Alternatively meditating, composing texts, instructing disciples and singing spiritual songs, his fame steadily increased and he became an impor-tant political figure in Tibet and elsewhere. It is paradoxical perhaps that a man who promoted the life of a mendicant yogin, and who emulated and propagated the lifestyle of Milarepa, had so many important connections among the powerful leaders. According to the hagiographies, gTsang smyon sometimes used his influence to reconcile the two sides in disputes and wars, and it was not uncommon that both the warring parties were his disciples and therefore listened to him. gTsang smyon also performed many miracles, healed the sick and re-moved epidemics that afflicted certain areas. He subdued ghosts, the walking dead (ro lang) and various kinds of evil spirits. These activities made him famous as a siddha (grub thob) and he was greatly respected and renowned for his powers. gTsang smyon practised and disseminated the core teachings of the bKa' brgyud tradition. He was known for his expertise and accomplishment in the 8"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Six Dharmas of Naropa (M'iro chos drug), the Four Letter Mahamudra (Phyag chen yi ge bzhi pa) and the esoteric Aural Transmissions (sNyan brgyud) of the bKa' brgyud tradition that had been transmitted by Milarepa's closest disciples. gTsang smyon was a lineage holder of the Aural Transmis-sion lineage, a lineage that had been transmitted by obscure yogins and yo-ginis, and not by aristocratic lineages of scholar abbots. Milarepa's disciple Ras chung pa (I 085-1161) was a central figure in the Aural Transmission lineage and one of the main Aural Transmission lineges is called the Aural Transmission of Ras chung (Ras chung sNyan brgyud).21 gTsang smyon's largest literary work was a compilation of these Aural Transmissions that included both his own works and works attributed to other masters of the tradition. He also compiled a hagiography and song collection of Marpa (100211012-1097), the teacher of Milarepa. This work also became popular and widely disseminated. In 1504, the king of Kathmandu, Ratnamalla, invited gTsang smyon to Nepal. Ratnamalla had repeatedly requested him to restore the famous Svayambhfi Stupa. Despite his disciples' attempt to persuade him to post-pone this difficult endeavor, encouraged by a vision, he decided that the time was ripe to do it. The renovation took less than three months, and many peo-ple participated. Having successfully accomplished the renovation of the famous stupa, he returned to Tibet. The hagiographies describe how even those who previously had entertained doubts about gTsang smyon were won over and were filled with faith when they heard how he had renovated the stupa. The Seventh Karmapa, Chos grags rgya mtsho (1451-1502), who was the most powerful religious dignitary at the time, wrote him a letter of praise, and the most powerful worldly leader of Tibet at the time-Don yod rdo rje ( 1462-1512)-invited him to visit and treated him with great respect. The acknowledgement he received from these and other religious and secular leaders was a sure sign that he had reached the highest possible esteem. Having successfully renovated the Svayambhu Stfipa, and also having written down and printed the hagiography and song collection of Milarepa, as well as an extensive collection of the Aural Transmissions of the bKa' brgyud tradition, he felt that his mission in life was completed. He showed some signs of illness and decided that he should pass away in the Cave of Ras chung (Ras chung phug) south of rTse thang (Tsetang). After a few weeks, in 1507, at age fifty-five (fifty-six according to Tibetan reckoning), he passed away, and his death was accompanied by miracles. People all over Tibet and Nepal lit butter lamps and made other offerings when they heard about gTsang smyon's death. Many statues of him were made, and his songs and life story were written down and printed. A large number of his disciples followed his example and practised meditation in the remote mountain areas 21 For an abbreviated life story of Ras chung in English, see Thrangu Rinpoche 2002. 9"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"that he himself had frequently visited and stayed at His disciples also carried on his literary activities and composed many texts, mainly hagiographies, song collections and instructions connected with his transmission lineage. Aims, Demarcations and Disposition The main aim of this dissertation is to describe how Sangs rgyas rgyal mtshan was transformed into a mad yogin. Moreover, his subsequent activi-ties as a mad yogin will be depicted and investigated. According to his life stories he was neither known as gTsang smyon (Madman of gTsang) nor as Heruka until his early twenties. Before that he had other names, the most common being the name he received when he was ordained: Sangs rgyas rgyal mtshan.22 Since this study will focus on how gTsang smyon became a mad yogin and on how he practised \"disciplined conduct\", it is the first and second of the above-mentioned three periods of gTsang smyon's life which are the main focus (i.e. his first thirty years). The third period of his life (i.e. his last twenty-five years) will not be entirely neglected; however I will restrict my-self to summarizing this period. It should be noted that there is a rather dra-matic dividing line between the first and second periods, but no clear-cut dividing line between the second and third periods of his life. A somewhat secondary aim has been to analyze and contextualize the ha-giographical material on which the study is based. I have chosen to focus on the religio-buddhological contexts and particularly on the Tibetan tantric Buddhist context. This demarcation entails that I have abstained from using, for example, pathological and psychological models when analyzing and conceptualizjng the hagiographical material. It would, for example, be pos-sible to investigate how the \"madness\" of gTsang smyon relates to indige-nous medical ideas about madness. However, since it is rather obvious that gTsang smyon and the other famous Tibetan mad yogins were not seen as being pathologically mad by their contemporaries, I think that religious, mainly Buddhist, explanations of their \"madness\" are more apt and useful when trying to understand them. The historical context in which the mad yogins lived is another important aspect to take into consideration when studying them. It seems unlikely that it was a mere coincidence that the famous mad yogins all lived during the same period.23 Despite the relevance of examining the historical and political contexts during gTsang smyon's and his disciples' lifetimes, I have chosen 22 For the sake of convenience, ! will stick to his sobriquet-gTsang smyon-in this disserta-tion, also when describing the earlier parts of his I if e. 23 The most famous mad yogins of Tibet all lived in the 15'h and 161h centuries.

Such an endeavor would have necessitated extensive studies of many texts, and since very few studies have covered this particular period of Tibetan history it would have been a very difficult pro-ject. Moreover, a historically oriented study would have required examining the latter part of gTsang smyon's life, during which he did things that were of more historical significance. The main sources of this study are Tibetan texts many of which have not previously been studied or translated. My contribution to tibetological, buddhological, and religious studies is to present, analyze and contextualize this unique body of material. The dissertation consists of three parts and ten chapters. This first part provides an introduction to the study and its sources. A brief presentation of gTsang smyon, his tradition, the mad yogins of Tibet, the historical period when they lived, and of previous studies will be given in Chapter I. Chapter 2 contains a general discussion about the genres to which the sources belong, namely hagiographies (rnam thar) and to some extent songs (mgur). The chapter also describes the main sources upon which the dissertation is based. Part Two is the central section of the dissertation and focuses upon gTsang smyon with special emphasis on how he became a mad yogin and his subsequent activities as a mad yogin. His life, as presented by his disciples, will be explored in this part, which is divided into five chapters. Chapter 3 deals with gTsang smyon 's birth and childhood; Chapter 4 with how he be-came a monk, met his main teacher and studied in a monastery; Chapter 5 how he became a mad yogin; Chapter 6 his activities as a mad yogin, and Chapter 7 the remainder of his I i fe. Part Three provides two different forms of background: the tantric Bud-dhist context and an outline of the I iterature which is associated with gTsang smyon and his tradition. Chapter 8 will investigate and describe the tantric Buddhist practices that gTsang smyon carried out and also look at some terms and concepts that are used in tantric texts for transgressive and seem-ingly mad behavior. This chapter will make it easier to understand why gTsang smyon acted as he did, and some readers might therefore find it use-ful to read Chapter 8 before reading Part Two. gTsang smyon 's own works, works about and by his main disciples, and about other people associated with him will be presented in Chapter 9. These texts will give us a somewhat wider perspective on gTsang smyon and his tradition. The dissertation ends with some conclusions derived from the material presented in the preceding three parts (Chapter I 0). 11"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Who is Mad? The Tibetan polymath dGe 'dun chos 'phel (1905-1951)24 gives a very tell-ing explanation of how relative the concept bf madness is in his polemic work An Adornment for Nliglirjuna 's Thought.25 In the text dGe 'dun chos 'phel cites Aryadeva's Catu/:tSataka (Four Hundred) where it is explained that one cannot dismiss the minority as being at fault on the basis that they are fewer in number. According to dGe 'dun chos 'phel, Aryadeva concludes his argument with the following rhetorical question: \"Therefore, why is it incorrect to say that the whole world is insane?\"26 dGe 'dun chos 'phel then paraphrases the following story from Can-draldrti' s commentary to Catu~ziataka, which illustrates the problem of dis-cerning who is mad and who is not.27 Once, in a country, there was an astrologer who went before the king and said, \"Seven days from now a rain will fall. All those whose mouths the wa-ter enters will go insane.\" When the king heard that he carefully covered the mouth of his well of drinking water and none of the rain fell into it. His sub-jects were unable to do the same and so the water went into all of their mouths and they all went insane. The king was the only one whose mind re-mained normal. In that country the way of thinking and the way of speaking of all the people did not agree with the way of thinking and the way of speak-ing of the king. Therefore, they all said, \"The king is insane\" [rgyal po Ia smyon pa zhes smod]. In the end, not knowing what else to do, the king drank the water, whereby he came to agree with everyone else.28 dGe 'dun chos 'phel concludes: Thus, due to the single great insanity from our having continually drunk the crazing waters [smyo chu] of ignorance from time immemorial, there is no confidence whatsoever in our decisions concerning what exists and does not exist, what is and is not. Even though a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred thousand of such insane people [smyon pa] agree, it in no way be-comes more credible.29 24 dGe 'dun chos 'phel was an unorthodox figure and is sometimes regarded as a mad yogin in his own right. 25 kLu grub dgongs rgyan.

Lopez mentions that this verse does not appear in Aryadeva's Catu~sataka and suggests that dGe 'dun chos 'phel misread the source (Lopez 2006: 49, n. 2). 27 Lopez notes that this story is found in Candraklrti's text, but dGe 'dun chos 'phel provides a paraphrase of the story rather than a direct quotation of it (Lopez 2006: 49, n. 2). 28 Lopez 2006: 49.

For example, if everyone wears clothes then a naked person is considered mad, but if the opposite is the case, a person with clothes is seen as mad. The way in which one defines madness depends on both cultural and historical factors. What was consid-ered mad in Tibet in the 151h and 161h century is perhaps normal to us, and vice versa. The common word that is used for a mad/crazy person in Tibetan is smyon pa. Khong smyon pared means: \"He is mad\" and smyon pais here used as a verbal adjective or participle. sMyon pais also used as an adjective proper in such phrases as kyi smyon pa; \"mad dog\". The word smyon pa is a nominalization of the verb smyo ba, which was used many times in the Mi-larepa song quoted at the beginning of this dissertation. Jaschke translates the verb with: \"to be insane, mad\", and gives the alternative spelling: myo ba.30 However, smyon pa or its verbal form smyo ba does not imply that someone is a mad yogin. Quite the contrary, the word implies mad in the negative sense, just like the English \"mad\", \"crazy\" or \"insane\". This means that when smyon is used as a part of gTsang smyon's name, it is used as a metaphor. gTsang smyon resembles a mad person but he is not regarded as being pathologically mad. The present Dalai Lama once explained why one of his predecessors, dGe 'dun rgya mtsho (1476-1542), referred to himself as a \"mad beggar\" (sprang smyon):31 The implication of \"Mad\" here is that when a person gains experience of emptiness, the ultimate mode of existence of all phenomena, his perception is as different from that of ordinary people as a madman's. Due to his or her re-alization of emptiness, a practitioner completely transcends the conventional way of viewing the world.32 This statement by the Dalai Lama clarifies how he and many other Tibetans look upon the mad yogins. The source of their mad behavior is believed to be totally different from that of a person who is mad in the ordinary sense of the word. Ardussi and Epstein put it this way: \"When Tibetans are ques-tioned about the motivation and meanings of these figures, they almost in-variably say that they behave the way they do because they are really Budd-has.'m Chogyam Trungpa similarly refers to what he calls \"crazy wisdom\" such as in the following passages from one of his books: ' 30 Jiischke 1977: 428. 31 This was the Second Dalai Lama. The fact that he was contemporary with gTsang smyon and the other famous mad yo gins, indicates that smyon pa was a rather common epithet, used far beyond the confines of peripatetic bKa' brgyudyogins in the 15th and 16'h centuries. 32 Dalai Lama 1994: II. 33 Ardussi & Epstein 1978: 327. 13"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"It is madness beyond the conceptualized point of view of ego. For example, if you are in an outrageous state of hatred and trying to relate with somebody as an object of that hatred, if that person doesn't communicate back to you in terms of hate, you might think he is a mad person. [ ... ] As far as you are con-cerned, that person is mad, because he has lost his perspective of aggression and passion[ ... ]. From the point of view ofsamsara, Buddha is mad.34 Other terms that are sometimes used for mad yogins are zhig po (\"mad as-cetic\") and 'khrul zhig (\"one who has realized emptiness\"). Roerich trans-lates zhig po in various ways, two examples being: \"mad ascetic\"35 and \"one who had abandoned all worldly laws\".36 Dan Martin explains that the term refers to \"a person who has totally dissolved (zhig pa) ordinary clinging to the concept of self as well as the usual bonds of social life.\"37 Such \"mad-men\" and \"madwomen\" act out their realization of Buddhist truths in uncon-ventional, \"crazy\" ways, he continues.38 There are thus several different terms used for the mad Tibetan yogins, and there are also specific terms used for the seemingly mad practices that they engaged in. We will encounter some of these terms in the hagiographies of gTsapg smyon when they are presented in Part 2, and also discuss some of the terms in Chapter 8. The Mad Yogins of Tibet The mad yogins of Tibet occasionally come up in books and stories. Some-times we encounter Buddhist masters who are called mad without any fur-ther information about the reason for this rather peculiar designation. At other times Buddhist masters who are not called mad are depicted as behav-ing in a way that seems odd and resembles a mad person's behavior. Seem-ingly mad behavior is sometimes found where we least expect it. The his-torical work Blue Annals (Deb ther sngon po) by Gos lo tsa ba gZhon nu dpal (1392-1481 ), for example, describes how the Indian monk-scholar Atisa (982-1054)-who was a key figure when Buddhism was reintroduced 34 Trungpa 1994: 22-23. Trungpa also explains \"crazy wisdom\" as \"a crazy experience, but not exactly ego madness. It's wisdom that has gone crazy. The element of wisdom here is its playfulness, humorousness, and its sybaritic quality. Even though you are irritated and naked and completely exposed without your skin, there is a sense of joy, or more likely, bliss\" (Trungpa 1994: 120). It should be noted that the term \"crazy wisdom\", which according to Trungpa is a translation of the Tibetan term ye shes 'cho/ ba \"wisdom gone wild\" (Trungpa 2001: 196), was called \"new vocabulary\" by the Dalai Lama (Dalai Lama, 1993, Western Buddhist Teachers' Coriference). 15 Roerich 1996: 132. 16 Roerich 1996: 181. ;7 Martin 2005: 57. 8 Martin 2005: 57. 4"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"in Tibet, and serves as a role model for monks in Tibet-once behaved in a way that does not accord with the way in which he is usually depicted.39 One day the Master.

'Brom ston pa cleaned (the floor) well, and did not feel any disgust at the conduct (of the Master's) physical body.40 The story about Atisa is not commented upon by the author, and the famous master is not called mad. It does, however, show that the mad yogins were not alone in being depicted as acting in odd and peculiar ways. At other times, we encounter stories of people that can be classified as mad yogins, both in name and behavior. Ronald Davidson cites an episode from the autobiography ofNyang raJ Nyi rna 'od zer (1124-1192) where a meeting with a Buddhist master who both behaved like a madman and was called mad is portrayed.

The line between the categories is blurred, and different people have different opinions. John Ardussin and Lawrence Ep-stein have outlined the following \"principal attributes of the saintly mad-man\" of Tibet: 39 Atisa came to Tibet I 042. 40 Rocrich 1996: 259; gZhon nu dpal 1984: 316-317: fan cig gi tshejo bos byis pa /tar rndzad nasI nang gi gnas rnams phyi sa chung ngu res bkang bas I de 'brorn ston pas legs par phyags I sku'i spyod pa Ia rna dad pa rnaskyespasl. 41 Davidson 2005: 330; Nyang ral Nyi rna 'od zcr 1978: 90-91: de nas lo nyi shu rtsagcig Ia bla rna rin po che srnyon pa don/dan gyi snyan po thos nasI rnos gus khyad par can skyes te I [ ... ] gcer bur bzhengs nas bdag gis lag pa Ia bzung zhing bro 'khrab ste I gson dang 'dir tshogs skalldan lam I I sngon gyi rntha · 'khob rgyal po Ia I I dus deng sang myang chung ral pa can I I sngon gyi sgra bsgyur lo tsii Ia I dus deng sang sm yon pa nga 'dra byung If ... } zhes gsung.~ te bro 'khrab pas I. 15"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"• A general rejection of customary behaviour which society at-large, and the monastic establishment in particular, regard as appropriate for the religious man ... • An inclination towards bizarre modes of dress ... • A disregard for the niceties of interpersonal behavior, particularly with regard to social status, modes of address, deferential behavior and so forth ... • A professed disdain for scholasticism, the study of religion through books alone, .. • The use of popular poetical forms, mimes, songs, epic tales, and so forth, during the course of their preaching ... • The use of obscenity and vulgar parlance.42 Geoffrey Samuel adds two more attributes to the list and says that the saintly madmen \"have great insight, and so are capable of seeing through other peo-ple's behavior and motivations; and they have great attainment, which is demonstrated by their magical power.\"43 As we will see in Part Two all these attributes fits in very well with the way gTsang smyon is presented in the sources. I would however like to add one more attribute to the list, namely compassion. It is striking that gTsang smyon and other mad yogins are de-picted as acting solely for the sake ofbenefitting other sentient beings. The majority of the mad yogins that we know anything about were men, but a few women that could be classified as mad yoginis have appeared too. One example of a female mad master of this kind is encountered in Blue Annals. When Atisa visited Lhasa \"a 9akii)I known as the 'Mad One of Lha-sa' [Lha sa'i smyon rna] uttered a prediction, following which the Master was able to extract the history of Lhasa from inside a beam (in the Jo khang).\"44 This is not the only place in the Blue Annals where mad yoginls are depicted; we find that the mother of a certain Kun bzang had obtained instruction in the doctrine from a nun named the \"Mad bSam grub\" (bSam grub smyon rna), for example.4; Several examples of mad yoginis are found in the \"Pacification\" (zhi byed) and \"Severance\" (gcod) traditions; for exam-ple the female founder of the gCod tradition, Ma gcig lab sgron (1055-1153), sometimes acted in a seemingly mad way according to her life sto-ries.46 Although masters that could be classified as mad yogins (or yoginls) ap-peared both during the \"earlier dissemination of the [Buddhist] teaching period\" (bstan pa snga dar) to Tibet (approximately 600-850 CE) and the 42 Ardussi and Epstein 1978: 332-333. 43 Samuel 1993: 303. 44 Roerich 1996: 258; gZhon nu dpal 1984: 316: lha sa'i srnyon rna zer ba 'i mkha' 'gro rna zhig gis lung bstan nas gdung gig seb nas ph yzmg. 45 Roerich 1996: 188.

It was at that time that gTsang smyon Heruka, 'Brug smyon Kun dga' legs pa (1455-1529), dBus smyon Kun dga' bzang po (1458-1532) and Thang stong rgyal po (1361-1485)47 roamed the plateau by turns shocking, provoking, amusing and frightening those who encountered them. These figures all be-came well-known and are still the ones that Tibetans and others usually refer to when asked about Tibetan mad masters. While there are life stories and songs (mgur) attributed to each one of these four figures in existence, we know far less about the mad yo gins of earlier periods. Even if the heyday of the mad yogins seem to have been the 151h and 161h centuries, mad yogins have continued to appear in Tibet and other places where Tibetan Buddhism has spread also after that period. A few more re-cent examples of masters who are described as acting in crazy and uncon-ventional ways are mKhan po Gang shar (d. 1980 or 1981),48 mDo mkhyen brtse ye shes rdo rje (1800-1859)49 and Nges don sgrub pa'i rdo rje (1871-1917).50 151h-161h Century Tibet The period when these famous mad yogins lived was characterized by reli-gious systematization and political fragmentation.51 Several different local kings and leaders struggled for dominion over the different Tibetan regions during the 151h and 161h centuries. Civil wars arose from time to time in many parts of Tibet, and the Tibetans faced many difficulties. Politically, the late 151h century was a time of transition and by the end of gTsang smyon's life, the Rin spungs pas had taken over much of the power from their former overlords, the Phag mo gru pas. The Rin spungs pas had their capital in gTsang, and the Phag mo gru pa~ were based in dB us. These 47 The dates of Thang stong rgyal po's life are disputed; other dates given by Tibetan Bud-dhist Resource Centre (TBRC) are: 1385-1509 and 1385-1464. 48 mKhan po Gang shar was a teacher of Chogyam Trungpa who also may be regarded as a modern example of a mad yogin. For some accounts about mKhan po Gang shar and his \"madness\", see Jackson D. 2003: 210-214. 49 Fora mam thar in Tibetan, see Ye shes rdo 1je and 'Od zer mtha' yas 1997. 5° For some examples of his \"craziness,\" see Tobgyal 1988: 49-51. There are several other examples of masters that might qualify as mad yo gins. I have heard accounts of mad yogins who are still alive, living both in Tibet and elsewhere. Nam mkha'i nor bu (1938-) describes a meeting with a mad yogin in his book C1ystal and the Way of Light, see Norbu 1986: 68-73. 51 It is difiicult to find good and detailed overviews of this period of Tibetan history. Many studies are dated or biased. Tucci's work Tibetan Painted Scrolls fi·om 1949 is still one of the most extensive studies.

According to the life stories of gTsang smyon, several regions were involved in sometimes very bloody conflicts such as: Bya yul and gNyalldMyal in Southern Tibet; Northern La stod (La stod byang) and Southern La stod (La stod lho) in Western Tibet; Gu ge and gLo (Mus-tang);52 Pu rang53 and gLo in far Western Tibet; Rin spungs and rGyal rtse in Central Tibet, and so forth. If the political climate was characterized by conflict and fragmentation, the religious climate was characterized by systematization and institutionali-zation. Tibetan Buddhism had already firmly taken root in Tibetan soil dur-ing the 151h century, but the previously close contact with Buddhist countries such as China, India and Central Asia had almost ended. The major tradi-tions of Tibetan Buddhism-rNying rna, bKa' brgyud, Sa skya and dGe lugs-were well established, and the schools became increasingly institu-tionalized and clearly defined during this period. The dGe lugs pa, or dGa' !dan pa school as it was originally called, was relatively new and steadily gained followers and influence. This school was not a separate religious tradition when it arose in the late l41h and early 151h centuries, but by the late l51h century it had developed into a separate tradition, sometimes involved in polemics with the other (older) traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. 54 The bKa' gdams pa tradition had lost some of its former prominence, but remained incorporated in other schools, most notably in bKa' brgyud and dGe lugs. Other traditions that were important were the Jo nang pa, Zhwa lu pa and Bo dong pa.55 Besides these schools, all of which had their own monasteries and monks, other traditions, such as Zhi byed, the Aural Transmission lineage of Ras chung, and gCod centered on particular practices, and were transmitted by wandering yogins. These three traditions, like the bKa' gdams pa, were gradually incorporated into the other traditions and ceased to exist as sepa-rate schools. Political and religious interests were intimately intertwined and the Bud-dhist traditions allied themselves with local rulers who thus became their patrons. This \"patron-priest\" relationship (mchodyon) was often crucial for 52 This place is sometimes spelled bLo in the sources but I will consistently spell it gLo. 53 There are several different ways to spell this name, other spellings often encountered is sPu rangs and Pu hrangs. For the sake of consistency I will spell it Pu rang. 54 The tradition's founder, Tsang kha pa, probably never saw his group as separate from the Sa skya tradition to which he and most of his followers belonged (DreyfiJss 2003: 26). 55 The Bon tradition also existed, but it is seldom mentioned in the materials on which this study is based. Zhwa lu/Zha luis a school named after the Zha lu monastery in gTsang and it resembles the Sa skya school. The alternative nam~ Bu pa, after the schools founder Bu stan rin chen grub (1290-1364) is also sometimes encountered. For Bu stan's rnam thar in Eng-lish, see Seyfort Ruegg 1966.

Moreover, Buddhism could sometimes serve as a stabilizing factor in trou-bled times. The symbiotic relationship between religious and worldly leaders gave rise to a sectarian and competitive climate among the different Bud-dhist schools. 57 The many conflicts and problems of the 15'h and 16'h centuries can easily overshadow the less negative aspects of the period. It was also a time of important cultural, religious, artistic and architectural developments. Many texts of great significance were composed and printed, extraordinary build-ings were erected, and outstanding works of art were produced. The period when gTsang smyon and the other mad yogins lived was thus very creative and dynamic. Hildegard Diemberger has highlightened this aspect of the period, and she compares it with the Italian renaissance. There were some parallels between this fragmented but intellectually produc-tive Tibet and Italy in the same period, with its political fragmentation into city-states and its extraordinary artistic and scientific productivity. Patronage of the arts and sciences became an important factor for the competing poli-ties, leading to the so-called \"campanilismo\" of the Italian Renaissance and bringing to the fore figures like Leonardo da Vinci, sometimes compared by Western scholars of Tibetan history to a Tibetan spiritual master, inventor, and artist of the same period named Thangtong Gyalpo, famous for his con-struction of iron-chain bridges over the Brahmaputra River as well as for his support of arts and drama. 58 In both cases, artists and scholars had to act stra-tegically in accepting or refusing patronage, collaborating, and negotiating constantly shifting allegiances. However, they also enjoyed the relative free-dom from a hegemonic power, which[ ... ] had an important effect on creativ-ity.59 The Mad Yogins of the 15th_ 16th Centuries It is within this historical framework that we must include the above-mentioned mad yogins if we are to understand them. They participated in and constituted an important part of the 15'h and 16'h century Tibetan reli-gious, political and social landscape. 56 For more information about the me hod yon relationship, see, for example, Seyfort Ruegg 1995. 57 For example: when the Phag mo gru pas and Rin spungs pas started to fight for political hegemony, the schools they supported, dGe lugs pa and Karma bKa · brgyud became involved in the conflict too. 58 1 t should be noted that Thang stong rgyal po was one of the above-mentioned mad yo gins. 59 Diemberger 2007: 33. 19"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The mad yogins were involved in several different polemics. They were involved in inter-sectarian polemics against the newly founded dGe lugs tradition, which was on the rise and steadily gaining new followers. The dGe lugs pa adherents often stressed that a thorough monastic background was needed before the tantric practices were applied, and they were often more inclined towards scholarly pursuits than the mad yogins. The mad yogins, on the other hand, often criticized the learned monks and portrayed them as arrogant and greedy. Although it is not always explicitly stated, it is some-times apparent that the target of the mad yogins' polemics was dGe lugs pa dge bshes.60 Instead of emphasizing monkhood, like Tsong Khapa (1375-1419) had done, the role model for the mad yogins was the tantric siddha (grub thob), and like the Indian siddhas they often acted in a transgressive and provocative fashion. The mad yogins were also involved in intra-sectarian polemics and seem to have disliked the way in which the bKa' brgyud tradition had developed.61 From having been a yogin-oriented group of practitioners who did not care about worldly activities, the bKa' brgyud school had become a monastic institution with hereditary lineages.62 In some ways the bKa' brgyud pas had thus abandoned the lifestyle of the early founders of their tradition, and the mad yogins advocated a return to that original lifestyle. Milarepa, Marpa and the Indian siddhas were the key symbols of the kind of lifestyle they advo-cated. In their quest for enlightenment the mad yogins followed a specific disci-pline, often called \"disciplined conduct\" (brtul zhugs) that is radically differ-ent from the discipline of the monks. Practising this discipline (brtul zhugs spyod pa) sometimes involved conduct that seemed crazy (smyo ba). This led people to call those who practised Buddhism in this way \"madmen\" (smyon pa), and their conduct separated them fi·om, and at times even upset, other Buddhists, not least the monk-scholars. The mad masters were yogins (rna/ 'byor pa) who preferred practising meditation in isolated mountain retreats and wandering around as homeless beggars, rather than studying in monasteries. Their highly unorthodox and often bizarre manners separated them not only from the monks but also from other yogins, and the label \"mad yogin\" (rna/ 'byor smyon pa), or simply \"madman\" (smyon pa) was sometimes used. Despite being just a few colorful vagabonds with outra-60 dGe bshes means \"virtuous friend\" (kalyii(Jamitra) which is a general designation for a Buddhist teacher, often a learned monk. In the dGc lugs pa tradtion the term was used as an academic title for those who had done extensive studies and had passed certain examinations. However, it is important to keep in mind that the title dge bshes also was used for monk-scholars in other schools. 61 This is discussed by Smith, 2001: 60. 62 bKa brgyud institutional development happened early. For example, already by the 13'h century sTag lung was said to be the largest monastery in Central Tibet. 20"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"geous manners, these smyon pas became influential and important in several ways, and their legacy still remains intact. Mad yo gins exist in all the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, but most of them belonged to or were affiliated with traditions that focused on meditation rather than studies. The famous mad yogins often belonged to or had affilia-tions with some of the many bKa' brgyud branches-the 'Brug pa bKa' brgyud branch i~ particular.63 We also find many mad yogins in the Zhi byedlgCod tradition and in the rNying rna tradition. Especially among the treasure revealers (gter ston) several mad yogins are found.64 A Survey of Previous Studies about gTsang smyon gTsang smyon was virtually unknown in the West before rGod tshang ras pa's rnam thar of him was published in India in 1969.65 Apart from a few learned Tibetans, not many knew anything about gTsang smyon at that time. But, when The Life of the Saint of gTsang by rGod tshang ras pa sna tshogs rang grol was published some Western scholars became aware of him. The publication made the most extensive rnam thar about gTsang smyon avail-able in the Tibetan language and-more importantly in terms of the recep-tion of gTsang smyon in the West-it includes a very informative English preface by E. Gene Smith.66 In this preface Smith introduces the mad yogins of Tibet in general and gTsang smyon in particular. It also contains a de-tailed description of \"the architecture of the biography\", where Smith sum-marizes the contents of each chapter in the Heart of the Sun.61 This summary is of tremendous help for anyone studying the Tibetan text. Moreover, the preface contains appendices that outline the different editions of the life story and song collection of Milarepa that gTsang smyon had compiled/8 and also of other bKa' brgyud pa hagiographic works that were compiled and printed by \"gTsang smyon and his school\".69 Jeffrey Hopkins aptly as-serts that it is truly remarkable \"how well these early studies have stood the test of time, the way they still provide countless jumping-off points for filr-ther research and reflection.\"70 The essay about gTsang smyon was later republished together with other essays by Smith under the title Among Ti-63 Three of the four above-mentioned smyon pas belonged to the bKa' brgyud tradition, and the fourth, Thang stong rgyal po, who is generally regarded as a rNying rna pa, is also counted as-a lineage holder of the Shangs pa bKa' brgyud tradition.

Before describing the gTsang smyon studies that followed the essay, I will summarize some of these early references. In Sarat Chandra Das's Tibetan-English dictionary first published in 1902, the following information is provided about mKhar kha: \"the birth-place of Grub chen gTsang smyon He ru ka, one of the celebrated Buddhist Tantrik saints of Tsang.\"74 Das was perhaps the first person to mention gTsang smyon to an English-speaking audience, and the reference to him makes it plausible that gTsang smyon was known, at least locally, in Tibet when Das visited the country. As far as I know, it was not until several years later that gTsang smyon's name again appeared in a book written in a West-em language. This time ( 1958), his name appeared in a translated guidebook to the holy places of central Tibet.75 In a note to the translated passage, the book's translator, Alfonsa Ferrari, cites the information from Das's diction-ary, and she also assumes that gTsang smyon could be identical with a cer-tain sMyon pa !dam chung of Upper sMyang who is mentioned in the Blue Annals.16 gTsang smyon was apparently still little known when Ferrari trans-lated the pilgrimage guide, and we now know that he is not identical with sMyon pa !dam chung.77 Rolf Stein provided an important piece of informa-tion when he identified gTsang smyon as the author of the life stories about Marpa and Milarepa in 1962.78 The same year Garma C.C. Chang, who translated the song collection of Milarepa into English, asserted that \"it was the fabulous and mysterious yogi, gTsang smyon Heruka-'The Mad Yogi from gTsang\"' who had authored or compiled the text.79 Chang, moreover, stated that gTsang smyon was a disciple of Phag rna gru pa (Ill 0-1170) and 71 Smith 200 I. 72 Schae!l\"er 200 I: 3. 73 My supervisor had The Life of the Saint of gTsang by rGod tshang ras pa sna tshogs rang gro/ in his room and showed it to me when I was an undergraduate student in the Dept. of History of Religions, Stockholm University. This contributed to my decision to write a disser-tation about gTsang smyon. 74 Das 1998 (1902]: 182. 7 5 Ferrari 1958: 51. 76 Ferrari 1958: 127, n. 266. 77 The information about this master in the Blue Annals clearly reveals that the person in ~uestion is not gTsang smyon. See, Roerich 1996 [ 1949]: I 030. Stein 1962:237. The book later appeared in English translation, Stein 1988 [1972): 276. 79 Chang (trans.) 1989 [ 1962]: 688. 22"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"as did Herbert V Guenther with whom Chang corresponded.80 In the intro-duction to The L!fe and Teaching of Naropa the book's author, Guenther, wrote that Lha btsun \"was a contemporary of the famous saint gTsang pa smyon pa'i He ru ka who according to tradition was one of the disciples of dPal Phag mo gru pa, who in turn was a disciple of sGam po pa.\"81 Both Guenther and Chang thus believed that gTsang smyon lived during the I ih century. Stein also had problems determining when gTsang smyon lived and asserted that gTsang smyon lived in the fourteenth century.82 Before Smith's essay and the publication of the Heart of the Sun, very lit-tle was therefore known.about gTsang smyon, and many uncertainties and much misinformation were in circulation. With Smith's essay the situation changed and a more accurate and less mysterious picture of the mad yogin started to emerge. As mentioned, the doors also opened for further studies. But it took more than fifteen years until the time was ripe for Ilze Maruta Stearns [Kalnins] to take another step towards fuller knowledge of gTsang smyon. In her master's thesis The L!fe of gTsang-smyon Heruka: A Study of Di-vine Madness Stearns [Kalnins] makes a thorough investigation of gTsang smyon. She focuses on gTsang smyon as a \"divine madman\" and also on his connection with Milarepa and his creation of Milarepa 's life story and song collection. Like Smith before her, Stearns's main source is the Heart of the Sun by rGod tshang ras pa.83 To a lesser degree both of them also used the Life St01y which Causes the Body-Hairs to Flutter by Lha btsun. Although both of them knew about its existence, neither of them had access to the the Lion of Faith by dNgos grub dpal 'bar when writing.84 Stearns [Kalnins] made a careful summary of the contents of The Heart of the Sun with the help of the L!fe Story which Cmtses the Body-Hairs to Flutter. She also translated sections of both rnam thars and, last but not least, translated two complete songs of gTsang smyon.85 The year after Ilze Maruta Stearns's [Kalnins] master's thesis was com-pleted, the Nalanda Translation Committee wrote a few pages about gTsang smyon based on Smith's essay in the introduction to their translation of gTsang smyon's Life of Marpa.86 Subsequently, two different Ph.D. dissertations that deal with gTsang smyon and his life story of Milarepa appeared. Robert Everett Goss wrote a dissertation titled The Hermeneutics of Madness: A Literary and Herme-8° Chang (trans.) 1989 [1962]: 688. 81 Guenther 1986 [ 1963): xv. 82 Stein 1962: 237; Stein 1988 [ 1972]: 276. 83 Smith's work mainly focuses on rGod tshang ras pa's text, which is natural since his article originally served as an introduction to an edition of the text. 84 The present dissertation thus complements them in this regard 851 have also translated one of the songs in Chapter 7. 86 Nalanda Translation Committee 1986: xx-xxiv. 23"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"neutical Analysis of the \"Mi Ia 'i rnam-thar\" by gTsang smyon Heruka, and Andrew Quintman recently wrote a dissertation named Mi Ia ras pa 's Many Lives: Anatomy of a Tibetan Biographical Cmpus. 87 Goss has some interesting theories about why gTsang smyon portrayed Milarepa as he did, but he has not investigated previous life stories of Mi-larepa nor has he studied the life stories of gTsang smyon. Instead he focuses on -the translated texts-especially gTsang smyon's life story of Milarepa, but his analysis is weakened by the fact that he has not studied the many Tibetan texts that are associated with Milarepa and gTsang smyon. Quintman, on the other hand, has done a very thorough investigation of previous Milarepa accounts and he is therefore able to make a much more in-depth analysis of gTsang smyon's version of the text. Besides that, Quint-man has also carefully studied the sections of the life stories about gTsang smyon that deal with Milarepa. In his dissertation he gives several reasons why gTsang smyon's version of Milarepa's life became such a success, and he shows how it differs from older versions. Quintman has also translated some sections of rGod tshang ras pa's and Lha btsun's life stories of gTsang smyon. Quintman's study resembles Steams's [Kalnins] work insofar as both investigate how gTsang smyon presented Milarepa and both have sometimes translated the same or similar passages of the life stories. There is also an article by the Italian scholar Kristin Blancke which fo-cuses on gTsang smyon's way of presenting Milarepa. The article is called \"The Personal Contribution of gTsang smyon He ru ka in the Mi la'i rnam mgur\" and it was the first of a planned series of articles that unfortunately have never been published.88 Kurtis Schaeffer has written two articles that concern gTsang smyon. In the article \"Dying like Milarepa: Death Accounts in a Tibetan Hagiographic Tradition\" he describes the death scene in the Heart of the Sun and compares it with the death scene of Milarepa as gTsang smyon described it, and also with the death scene of bSod nams blo gros who was a disciple of gTsang smyon.89 Schaeffer thus concentrates on gTsang smyon's last days and his death. This is an aspect that has not been covered in other gTsang smyon studies, and he contributes an interesting analysis and useful information. The second article that Schaeffer has written is perhaps even more important since it provides us with a substantial investigation of the literature that gTsang smyon and his disciples printed during and after gTsang smyon's lifetime. It was during the II th Seminar of the International Association for Tibetan Studies (IATS), Bonn 2006, that Schaeffer presented this paper and it will be published in the forthcoming proceedings of the seminar. The title 87 Goss 1993; Quint man 2006. 88 Blancke, unpublished. Blancke kindly sent me the first of these planned articles.

In an appendix to his article Schaeffer presents a list of the block-prints of gTsang smyon's tradition that were printed at Brag dkar rta so, Ras chung phug and elsewhere. The list supple-ments the one that Gene Smith published in 1969, and it provides important bibliographic reference points for further specialized studies.90 During the IATS seminar I presented a paper on gTsang smyon that also will be published in the forthcoming proceedings. The paper was titled: \"What Do the Childhood and Early Life of gTsang-smyon Heruka Tell us about his bKa' brgyud Affiliation?\"91 As the title indicates, the paper is about the early life of gTsang smyon, from his birth up to his early twenties, and a description of how gTsang smyon gradually became a bKa' brgyud pa pur-ist. Another short article titled \"The Mad Heruka from gTsang: Madness as a Buddhist Practice\" will be published in Tibet Journal. This article is based on a paper presented at the XIVth Conference of the International Associa-tion of Buddhist Studies in London 2005. In this article I present some pre-liminary observations about gTsang smyon and his mad form of practice, observations that are developed and deepened in the present dissertation.92 Besides these studies where gTsang smyon figures prominently, there are others written by scholars focusing on other things but whose studies have touched upon him, his tradition, and/or his disciples. Peter Alan Roberts wrote a Ph.D. thesis about the life stories of Ras chung pa that was later published.93 This study provides a thorough investi-gation of the hagiographical traditions of Milarepa's disciple Ras chung pa and it resembles Quintman's study ofMilarepa. Roberts investigates how the life stories of Ras chung pa have changed and developed. Since gTsang smyon was a lineage holder of Ras chung's Aural Transmissions, and since he and his disciples wrote and printed many major works about or associated with Ras chung pa, both gTsang smyon and his disciples figure prominently in Roberts's study. Another scholar who has written a dissertation and several articles related to gTsang smyon and his disciples is Marta Semesi. Her dissertation-The A ural Transmission of Saf!lvara and Ras chung pa 's Legacy---is a thorough study of the Aural Transmissions of the bKa' brgyud school. Since gTsang smyon was both a lineage holder of one of the more important branches of this tradition and also made a compilation of texts from the Aural Transmis-sion, he and his disciples figure in it.94 90 Schaeffer, forthcoming. 91 Larsson, forthcoming a. 92 Larsson, forthcoming b. 93 Roberts 2000; Roberts 2007. 94 Semesi 2007 a.

Ehrhard is cur-rently preparing an article on gTsang smyon's disciple rGod tshang ras pa, and his many studies provide much detailed information taken from rare Tibetan sources.95 Some studies that deal with gTsang smyon's trips to, and activities in, Nepal have also been done. rGod tshang ras pa's description of gTsang smyon 's second visit to Nepal has been translated by Lewis and Jamspal, and Alexander von Rospatt has described gTsang smyon's renovation of the Svayambhu StiJpa.96 Several historians have used the Heart of the Sun as a source. David Jack-son has translated an amusing section of it in his A Histoty of Tibetan Paint-ing.91 Luciano Petech used it when he wrote about Ya tshe, Gu ge and Pu rang,98 as did Roberto Vitali in his study ofGu ge and Pu rang.99 It is noteworthy that most scholars have used the Heart of the Sun by rGod tshang ras pa to obtain information about gTsang smyon, and some have also used the Life st01y which Causes the Body-Hairs of the Faithful to Flutter by Lha btsun. As far as I know, nobody has made use of the the Lion ofF aith that was written by dNgos grub dpal 'bar.100 In this dissertation I will use the Lion of Faith extensively, and I will focus on gTsang smyon's first thirty years, a period that has not previously been covered in detail in Western scholarship. Sources and Studies about the other Famous Mad Yogins As mentioned above, gTsang smyon was not the only mad yogin in Tibet. Three other famous smyon pas lived at approximately the same time period, 'Brug pa kun legs, dBus smyon Kun dga' bzang po and Thang stong rgyal po.

'Brug pa kun legs is one of the most famous mad yo gins, and this is re-flected in the many songs and stories that are attributed to him, both in oral and written form. The oldest and most reliable text is probably his Collected Works (gsung 'bum) that most likely was compiled in Dri'u !has in south-eastern Tibet in 1592.101 The biographical material that is included in this collection is written in the form of an autobiography (rang gi rnam thar), but this does not necessarily reflect the actual way it was composed. It is unlike-ly that the life story was written by 'Brug pa kun legs himself.101 The Col-lected Works of 'Brug pa kun legs consists of four different sections of dif-ferent lengths and with different titles.103 The parts are enumerated according to Tibetan custom with letters instead of numbers. Thus the first part is ka, the second kha, the third ga and the fourth nga. The first two parts-ka and kha-have been translated, and it is in these that most of the biographical material is found. The first volume-ka-is the most extensive (169 folios) and has been translated into French by Rolf Stein in his Vie et chants de 'Bntg-pa kun-legs le yogin.104 Stein's work is still one of the most important studies that have been done in the West on a particular mad yogin.105 His translation is preceded by an introduction, and he also provides the reader with helpful notes in the translated text itself: A section of the second part-kha-of 'Brug pa kun legs' Collected Works was translated in John Ardussi's master's thesis 'Brug pa kun legs, the Saintly Tibetan Madman.106 Ardussi's work-together with Ilze Maruta Steams's master's thesis-is one of the few studies that have been done in English on a mad yogin. There is also a rather extensive oral tradition that is attributed to 'Brug pa kun legs.107 Many of these stories are quite different from the ones found in the Collected Works and resemble \"dirty stories\" (btsog gtam). Some of the 101 Ardussi 1972: 75. 102 Ardussi 1972: I; Stein 1972: 25. 103 Several different editions of this text have been published in Tibetan.

Some of the stories can, however, with a little good will, be interpreted as Buddhist teachings. Still others are clearly Buddhist in content, and do not differ from stories of Milarepa and other less controversial figures. Many of these types of stories where 'Brug pa kun legs figures, after having been transmitted orally for centuries, were eventually written down. This kind of literature is frowned upon by some learned Tibetan lamas, while others accept them as being authentic descriptions of the activities of an enlightened adept. Many of these books have been produced in Bhutan where 'Brug pa Kun legs is particularly popular and important. An example of this type is a life story called The Essence of the Ocean which is Meaningful to Behold: the L~fe Story of Kun dga' legs pa, the Protector of Beings by dGe bshes Brag phug dGe 'dun rin chen ( 1926-). This text was published for the first time in 1966 in Bhutan109 and is available in English translation, and could therefore easily be compared with Stein's and Ardussi's translations of the older and more historically reliable life story that was produced in Tibet.110 There is also a German translation of yet another life story of 'Brug pa kun legs.111 Another important figure who is sometimes counted as a mad yogin is the famous builder of iron suspension bridges, Thang stong rgyal po. The main life story about him is titled All-illuminating Mirror of Jewels: A Biography of the Glorious Lord of Siddhas bTson 'gms bzang po.112 Cyrus Stearns re-cently translated this important text.

An often quoted study is Ardussi and Epstein's article \"The Saintly mad-man in Tibet\" in Himalayan Anthropology from 1978.120 This article, and the above-mentioned essay by Smith, are probably the most cited texts when the mad yogins of Tibet are described. Ardussi and Epstein's article contains several interesting observations about the mad yo gins and their list of \"the principal attributes of the saintly madman\" is particularly relevant.121 In his article \"Elements, Insanity and Subjectivity\" David Germano describes how \"craziness\" could be used as a practice in the \"extraordinary preliminaries\" which lead to \"direct transcendence\" (thad rgal) in the rNying rna tradition.

Geoffrey Samuel devotes a chapter of his book Civilized Shamans to \"Folk Shamans, Terton, and Crazy Siddhas\"123 and describes the mad yogins as \"a'shamanic critique of clerical-ization.\"124 Samuel also describes gTsang smyon briefly.125 His book is im-portant because it describes the non-monastic---{)r as he calls it \"shamanis-tic\" -side of Buddhism that has often been neglected. Rolf Stein provides a brief discussion of the mad yogins in his book Tibetan Civilization and, as mentioned above, he was one of the first Western scholars who described them and held them to be important.126 In his book about the Tibetan renais-sance, Ronald Davidson mentions that, based on his understanding of the documents he has studied, he has traced a fairly large number of loosely associated actors who were instrumental to the Buddhist revival during the so-called Tibetan renaissance.127 One such group was the crazy yo gins: Fourth, there were the crazy yogins (smyong ba),128 invoking the behavior of Mila Repa or other wandering tantrikas constructing a Tibetan version of In-dian siddha behavior. Some were occasionally on a continuum with the popu-lar preachers, and their songs had wide appeal. Others were more closely re-lated to the Indian or Nepalese siddhas wandering in and out of Tibet, such as Padampa Sangye or Gayadhara. 129 The essays, pictures and statues contained in the book Holy Madness: Por-traits ofTantric Siddhas shows the link between the Indian siddhas and the Tibetan mad yogins.130 Many of these short essays deal with the mad yogins of Tibet, and the book also contains a picture of a statue of gTsang smyon.131 The Tibetan lama ChOgyam Trungpa (Chos rgyam drung pa, 1940-1987) who is famous for popularizing Buddhism in the West wrote a book titled Crazy Wisdom and he has described what he called \"crazy wisdom\" in some of his other books as well. 132 Several Tibetan lamas and some of Trungpa's disciples have stated that Trungpa was a mad yogin in his own right.

Thar pa is synonymous with enlightenment, and the rnam thar literature thus usually describes the path to enlightenment. Although this is typically the case, the term is also sometimes used for a biography in a more general sense. Jaschke translates rnam par thar pa with \"biography\", \"legendary tale about a saint\", \"tale\", \"story\" and \"description in general\".136 However, the rnam thars that I have used \"share the presumption-or at least the sugges-tion-that the protagonist reached full liberation\", as Janet Gyatso has aptly ex pressed i t.137 The most obvious model for Buddhist \"liberation accounts\" is the life sto-ry of the historical Buddha. The description of how Buddha Sakyamuni be-came enlightened-and thus reached complete liberation (rnam par thar pa)-is central in Buddhism; indeed, one might even say that the life of the Buddha forms the heart or foundation of Buddhism. After all Buddhism does concern and describe a path to enlightenment. Buddha is therefore both the source and goal of Buddhism, and a buddha teaches not only through his teaching but also through his personal example-his life. It is therefore not surprising that the followers of Buddha Sakyamuni wanted to preserve his memory and composed accounts of his life. Various biographical fragments are found in the canonical texts but a full life story was not completed until several centuries after his passing into final nirvana. The earliest extant bio-graphical composition that depicts his whole life-from birth to death-was written in the first century CE by Asvagho~a. Asvagho~a's life story of the 134 For a general overview of the rnam thar-literature, see Tucci 1949: 139-150; Vostrikov 1970: 180-198. m Vimok~a does not denote a literary genre, however, but the Buddhist ideal of liberation. 136 Jaschke 1977: 314. 137 Gyatso 1998: I 03. 32"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Buddha-Buddhacaritd38-was translated into Tibetan, and together with Lalitavistara139 and other accounts of the life of the Buddha it probably served as a prototype for the Tibetan rnam thar literature.140 Besides showing how amazing and fantastic the Budqha was, the life stories also serve as pedagogical devices. A Buddhist practitioner has much to learn from the life of the Buddha, and it is important to keep in mind that for a Buddhist the Buddha was not only an exceptional individual worthy of praise· but also someone that an aspirant to enlightenment should follow and emulate. His life story presents the Buddhist teachings in the form of a personal example, and this way of teaching is sometimes easier to understand than theoretical expositions of the Dharma. Many basic Buddhist doctrines, such as renun-ciation, karma, samsara, nirvana and reincarnation are clearly revealed in his life story. John S. Strong has pointed out that Buddha's life story reflects a bio-graphical paradigm, a buddha-life blueprint, which all buddhas follow.141 Consequently, ifbuddhahood is to be obtained, his fife should be emulated. The \"buddha-life blueprint\" also became very important when biographical accounts of subsequent masters were written down. By incorporating ele-ments and themes from the life of the Buddha in the description of the life of a specific individual, the charisma of the Buddha rubbed off on to the one who was being portrayed, and the effect of this was two-fold. On the one hand, it proved the validity of the Buddhist teaching, and the individual be-came an example that proved that it was possible, even in later times, to reach liberation by practising Buddhism. On the other hand, it also proved to others that the individual, his lineage, and disciples were genuine and worthy of support and devotion. Janet Gyatso has noted that \"autobiography and biography reflect the competitive climate of Tibetan sectarian politics\", and this aspect of a hagiography is important to bear in mind.142 Sometimes a rnam thar was written primarily as a kind of propagandistic device that served to strengthen the position of a specific lineage, lama and/or monas-tery. Strong describes how the bio-blueprint gradually became quite detailed and specific.143 The Tibetan tradition enumerates \"Twelve Great Acts\" of a m Sangs rgyas kyi spyod pa shes bya 'i snyan dngags chen po. 139 'Phags pa rgya cher ro/ pa zhes bya ba theg pa chen po 'i mdo. 140 The latter is more embellished and became particularly influential within the Mahayana tradition.

Final nirvana That gTsang smyon and his disciples were influenced by the life of the Bud-dha and used it as a model is apparent in both the form and contents of the texts that they wrote. gTsang smyon composed a verse of praise to Milarepa in the form of the \"Twelve Great Acts\", 145 and he also reframed Milarepa's life story in terms of the twelve acts, again elevating the subject's status by modeling it on representations of the Buddha's own life.146 rGod tshang ras pa compared gTsang smyon's birth with the birth of the Buddha in the gar-dens of Lumbinl as the son of king Suddhodana, 147 and in his colophon to the rnam thar of Ras chung pa he called Ras chung phug \"the second Kuslnagara [because it was] the place where the human emanation of the Victorious One, the great Vajradhara-gTsang smyon Heruka-merged his rii.pakiiya with dharmadhtitu.\"148 It was not only the historical Buddha that served as a model for the Ti-betan hagiographer, however. Descriptions of other exceptional individuals that walked in his footsteps did so as well. Accounts of bodhisattvas and siddhas were particularly important. The bodhisattva became the ideal in the Mahayana tradition, and accounts of both the Buddha's own previous lives as a bodhisattva and of some other important bodhisattvas became popular in Tibet. Lha btsun describes how gTsang smyon read the story of the Ever 144 mDzad pa bcu gnyis. There are some variations in this list depending on which sources that are consulted.

Besides the bodhisattva, another figure that influenced how gTsang smyon was described was the siddha (gntb thob). gTsang smyon was often called grub thob and according to the rnam thars he dressed and acted like a siddha. Stories of the Indian siddhas were thus another important source of inspiration for the Tibetans who composed rnam thars, and several such siddha-biographies were available in Tibetan. One of the most well-known examples is a compilation of eighty-four short siddha-stories claimed to have been created by the Indian master Abhayadatta in the late 11th or early l21h century.150 The siddhas often appeared mad, acting strangely and provoca-tively. It is therefore logical that the Tibetans used siddha-stories as a model when writing about the mad yogins. Outrageous actions and strange ways of dressing that can not be justified by using the historical Buddha or the bodhi-sattvas as a model may be justified with the help of the siddha-stories. Despite its Indian predecessors, the rnam thar literary genre is more char-acteristic of Tibetan than Indian Buddhism.151 Janet Gyatso has pointed out that the large number of Tibetan autobiographies and biographies is \"striking evidence of the popularity of the charismatic individual in Tibetan soci-ety.\"152 The Tibetans developed their own ways of systematizing the rnam thars, and the most fundamental distinction was between a life account writ-ten by someone other than the individual depicted, and a life account written by the individual him or herself The Tibetan terms for these two categories are rnam thar and rang gi rnam thar (short: rang rnam) which could be translated as \"biographies\" and \"autobiographies\" respectively. Both kinds of rnam thars are very common, and as Gyatso has pointed out, the catego-ries often overlap. A rnam thar written by the subject him or herself-an autobiography (rang rnam)-is often actually dictated to a scribe, and thus in reality is written down by somebody else.

Sometimes the texts are divided into \"common or general\" (thun mong) and \"uncommon o~ private\" (thun mong rna yin pa) rnam thars. As the terms somewhat vaguely convey the difference between the \"common\" and the \"uncommon\" life stories is as follows: the common category focuses upon the general and visible aspects of the subject's life (such as places vis-ited and persons met), while the uncommon category focuses upon particular and individual mystical events (such as miraculous dreams and visions). A I. Vostrikov notes that these two categories are also called outer (phyi) and secret (gsang) respectively, and he also mentions a third, inner (nang) cate-gory.154 The inner category of rnam thars (nang gi rnam thar) contains lists of teachings and empowerments received, and sometimes of retreats that the subject of the rnam thar has carried out. The inner life story is closely re-lated to the so-called \"records of teachings received\" (thob yig or gsan yig), although the latter is also a separate genre.1ss The different categories are sometimes found within one and the same text. Nevertheless, other times a text belongs exclusively to one category. As noted above, the secret rnam thar (gsang ba 'i rnam thar) focuses on inner yogic experiences, visions and dreams that have been transformative and important for the subject of the text. While this is the common way of explaining these kinds of texts, some Tibetan exegetes add more meaning to it. Chos rgyal rgya mtsho, for in-stance, points out that a secret rnam thar is an \"uncensored account of the lama's activity\" that should be \"kept hidden away from people who are fol-lowing a pure Hinayana discipline or the path of Mahayana altruism.\"156 Karma Chags rued ( 1613-1678) similarly characterizes a secret rnam thar as \"that which is difficult for those with small minds and perverted views to conceive.\"1s7 The secret category is thus not written for the general reader, but specifically for the select few who are able to read it without misunder-standing it and without developing wrong views (log Ita). Tibetan exegetes, such as these, seem to indicate that a secret rnam thar could contain descrip-tions of actual events, meetings with actual people, concrete actions and so forth~-just like the outer or general rnam thar-but since this information is not intended for the general reader it should not be included in the outer or general rnam thar. It should perhaps be mentioned that Chos rgyal rgya mtsho 's remark is taken from the preface to a translation of a life story about ISl Gyatso 1998: I 03. 1s4 Vostrikov 1970: 186-187.

These three levels roughly correspond to the outer, inner and secret categories that the Tibetans themselves use.160 The various layers or levels of a rnam thar-the outer, inner, and secret aspects, and so forth-all convey important aspects of a master's spiritual career, and one and the same text often contains several different elements. Sometimes a rnam thar focuses on one particular aspect of the protagonist's life and is therefore classified as, for instance an outer rnam thar, but the secret and inner aspects are often included in such texts as well. Janet Gyatso has aptly pointed out that \"the proliferation of labels naming increasingly esoteric levels of discourse is often more a matter of rhetoric than genuinely descriptive of content. \"161 The many shades of meaning of the term rnam thar make it a bit compli-cated to translate into English. Since the term is used for a specific kind of Tibetan Buddhist life stories, I have often retained the Tibetan term. How-ever, occasionally, for the sake of variation, I have used other terms such as \"life story\" and \"hagiography\". Songs Another important ingredient in many-but not all-rnam thars is spiritual songs (mgur). Already before Buddhism was disseminated on the Tibetan plateau, various religious specialist are known to have used songs to transmit a religious message. Before the famous dharma king Srong btsan sGam po's time, Tibetan historians inform us, Tibet was protected by singers of riddles (lde'u), storytellers (sgrung) and bon pos.162 All three traditions still exist in Tibet, though in a different form than in ancient times. What mainly concern us here are the singers of riddles and storytellers. The latter are famous as singers of the epic of king Ge sar of gLing, and the. former were a type of specialist that sang question-and-answer songs that dealt with the creation of 158 Dowman, Keith and Sonam Paljor (trans.) 1983. 159 Similarly, Stein has pointed out that the oldest Tibetan version of 'Brug pa kun legs rnam lhar was never widely disseminated. The reason for this is that it was only meant to be read bd; his closest disciples because others easily could misunderstand it (Stein 1972: 4 ). 1 Willis 1995: 5. 161 Gyatso 1998: I 03. 162 Stein 1988: 191-192. 37"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"the world and with human and divine genealogies.163 Both the storytellers and the singers of riddles influenced the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual songs and also the rnam thars. The most common generic term used for songs-both before and after Buddhism was disseminated in Tibet-is glu. mGur was originally a sub-category of glu but the term eventually came to be used primarily for reli-gious songs with an experiential component.164 mGur is the term used for Milarepa's famous songs, and it is also used for the songs attributed to gTsang smyon. Roger R. Jackson states that it was with Milarepa that the tenn came to designate a primarily religious genre.165 Besides the indigenous elements of the Tibetan religious songs, other important elements that were incorporated into them came from the outside. One of the major influences was the tantric songs that had been brought to Tibet by Marpa and other Tibetans who traveled to Nepal and India mainly during the later dissemina-tion period (phyi dar) of Buddhism to Tibet, and also by Indian masters who visited Tibet. The siddhas of India used songs to transmit or express their realization to others. Songs are attributed to several of the most famous In-dian siddhas such as Saraha, Kp:;~1acarya/Kal)ha and Tilopa.166 Three catego-ries of such siddha-songs are often mentioned: dohii, vajriiglti (rdo rje 'i glu) and caryiiglti (spyod pa 'i g/u).167 These songs express the spiritual realiza-tions of the siddha in an often spontaneous and symbolic manner.168 The Tibetan yogins generally sang their songs in a direct and simple manner. Cyrus Steams describes how the Tibetan yogin Ko brag pa ( 1170-1249) used colloquial expressions and a minimum of technical vocabulary in his songs, for example.169 The same holds true for the songs of many other Tibetan yo gins. The con-tents of a song depended on the listeners for whom the song was intended. Sometimes the yogins sang for ordinary uneducated people such as farmers, hunters and nomads. On such occasions the songs popularized the Buddhist teachings and communicated them to the common people. At other times the songs were sung among tantric practitioners at tantric feasts (ga~zacakra) or as direct instructions to a specific disciple with much prior knowledge and experience of esoteric Buddhism. Songs sang under such circumstances con-tain profound yogic instructions that are difficult to understand for the unini-163 Stein 1988: 195. 164 Jackson, R. 1996: 372. 165 Jackson, R. 1996: 372. 166 For a study of Saraha, see Schaeffer 2005.

More details about the tantric siddha songs are found in Ardussi 1977; Guenther 1969; Jackson, R. 1996, Jackson, R. 2004; Kvaeme 1977; Templeman 1994. 168 Jackson, R. 1996: 373. 169 Steams 2000: 14. 38"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"tiated. Don grub rgyal lists seven major types of mgur, those that: (I) re-member the guru's kindness, (2) indicate the source of one's realization, (3) inspire the practice of dharma, (4) give _instructions on how to practise, (5) answer disciples' questions, (6) admonish the listeners to uproot evil and (7) serve as missives to gurus or disciples.170 Although Don grub rgyal's list is very apt, it should be kept in mind that the seven types often overlap and are combined in one and the same song. As has been noted above, the songs are frequently included in rnam thars, and when songs are included, they constitute an important part of the life story. At other times songs are issued separately and stand more or less on their own. Such song collections are called mgur 'bum, literary \"hundred thousand songs\". Although they resemble the life stories in certain ways, the song collections lack many of the biographical details of the latter. They do, however, generally contain a narrative frame around the songs, and the col-lections thereby include biographical elements. The narrative frame that surrounds a song is closely connected with, and difficult to separate from, the song. It provides needed background and often explains where, when, why and for whom a song was sung. Parts of the meaning of the song thus derive from its surrounding narrative. The close relationship between the song and its narrative frame resembles the relationship between the pictures and the talk balloons in a cartoon. Without the balloons, the pictures in the cartoons become incomprehensible, and vice versa. In the songs, the master depicted in the story gets the opportunity to communicate (sing) directly to the reader/listener and thereby get his or her message across. Another impor-tant aspect of the songs that should be kept in mind is that they are believed to come directly from the master in question, which makes them autobio-graphical in a way.171 Since the songs are supposed to come from a realized and awakened mas-ter, the person whose life is depicted in the rnam thar has to achieve libera-tion (thar pa) and realization (rto g pa) before he or she will have anything to sing about. There must also be some devoted disciples who remember and record their songs. The songs are therefore usually found in the latter part of a rnam thar. Both songs and rnam thars are closely connected with gTsang smyon and the bKa' brgyud tradition. gTsang smyon devoted his life to compiling rnam thars and song collections as did his disciples. Stein notes that the literary creativity of the mad yo gins originated in two main sources: \"their rapture or 'madman-like' inspiration\" and \"their knowledge of the traditions, songs and poetry of the people, whose life they like to share.\"172 170 Don grub rgyal cited in Jackson, R. 1996: 374. 171 We may assume that some songs actually originate with the subject and that others are composed by someone else and ascribed to him or her. 172 Stein 19HH: 276. 39"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Main Sources Three of gTsang smyon's direct disciples wrote life stories about their lama: rGod tshang ras pa, Lha btsun and dNgos grub'dpal 'bar.173 The rnam thars were written in the 161h century, and were subsequently carved into wooden blocks, printed and disseminated. The contents of these texts will be pre-sented in detail in Part Two, but first it might be useful to provide an over-view of these texts. The three rnam thars about gTsang smyon are closely related to one an-other, and the disciples that wrote them probably met, both during and also after, gTsang smyon's lifetime.174 The fact that the rnam thars give a very similar picture of gTsang smyon indicates that the same sources were used by all three authors. Since they all were his direct disciples they also saw and heard things that they could incorporate in their texts.175 Besides personal accounts they also used accounts written or told by other disciples of gTsang smyon. Both Lha btsun and dNgos grub dpal 'bar mention that they read a text about gTsang smyon's life that was written by Nor bu dpalldan pa, an-other one of gTsang smyon's \"heart-sons\".176 Another important common source that was regarded as authoritative was gTsang smyon's female com-panion, Kun tu bzang mo. She was held in high regard by gTsang smyon's disciples and played an important role in promoting the teachings of her \"husband\".177 dNgos grub dpal 'bar also mentions that he used notes about the restoration of the Svayambhu Stupa that were written by rGod tshang ras pa, and since rGod tshang ras pa wrote one of the rnam thars they probably have used the same information regarding this important event.178 dNgos grub dpal 'bar also mentions that he used notes written by Lo pal) pa when he wrote about gTsang smyon's death.179 Since the account of gTsang smyon's death is very similar in rGod tshang ras pa's text we may assume that rGod tshang ras pa either relied on Lo pal) pa 's text too, or that he relied 173 There are rnam thars about both rGod tshang ras pa and Lha btsun, and both of them also composed many texts. dNgos grub dpal 'bar, on the other hand, is far less known. In Chapter 9 a survey of rGod tshang ras pa's and Lha btsun's life stories and also a brief overview of their works will be given. 174 Smith mentions that Rab 'byams pa dNgos grub dpal 'bar was one of Lha btsun's many lamas (Smith 2001: 75). 175 Both dNgos grub dpal 'bar and Lha btsun mention that they inserted things that he had heard directly from gTsang smyon into their rnam thars.

Lha btsun only briefly describes gTsang s~nyon's death, and he refers those who want to know more about it to texts written by former disciples.180 The fact that dNgos grub dpal 'bar's rnam thar is the earliest, completed only one year after gTsang smyon's death, makes it plausible to assume that the other authors used it as one of their main sources. This is also supported by the many passages that are identical in all three rnam thars. When reading the texts one finds that some details differ, but that the chronology and general contents accord. The different rnam thars have their own merits and they complement each other in various ways. rGod tshang ras pa's rnam thar is the most extensive, while Lha btsun supplies more dates, for example. Since the present study focuses on the first thirty years of gTsang smyon's life I have concentrated on the sections that describe this period of his life and compared these parts of the three texts carefully. When summa-rizing the latter part of gTsang smyon's life I have mainly used dNgos grub dpal 'bar's text and sometimes supplemented it with details from the other rnam thars. rGod tshang ras pa devotes nine and a half chapters, in all sixty-three pages, of the Heart of the Sun to the first thirty years or so of gTsang smyon's life.181 Lha btsun describes gTsang smyon's first thirty years in fif-ty-four pages.182 Lha btsun's account is interesting since he includes much information that is not mentioned by rGod tshang ras pa or dNgos grub dpal 'bar. dNgos grub dpal 'bar gives a rather brief account and devotes about twenty-five pages to the period.183 The Collected Songs of gTsang smyon Heruka There is also a collection of songs (mgur 'bum) attributed to gTsang smyon that belongs to the same edition as the earliest rnam thar.114 The colophon of 180 L: 127. Unfortunately Lha btsun does not mention the names of these people but it is prob-ably rGod tshang ras pa and dNgos grub dpal 'bar that he means. 181 G: 1-63. Since rGod tshang ras pa seldom provides dates and rarely mentions gTsang smyon's age it is hard to be exact. 182 L: 1-54. On page fifty-four Lha btsun states that gTsang smyon was thirty years old when he went to La phyi and Chu bar. 183 N: lb-13a. dNgos grub dpal 'bar does not mention gTsang smyon's age which makes it hard to estimate when he turned thirty and therefore which pages of the rnam tharthat depicts his first thirty years. dNgos grub dpal 'bar's text has not been published in book format and is therefore paginated in the traditional format with a front and back side of each page, i.e.: I a and I b, 2a and 2b, and so forth. Both rGod tshang ras pa and Lha btsun 's texts have been issued as books and the pages are paginated with a new number for the back side of each Tibetan page, i.e.: I and 2, 3 and 4, etc. 184The name of the song collection is rJe btsun gtsangpa he ru ka 'i mgur 'bum rin po che dbang gi rgyal po thams cad mkhyen pa 'i lam stan (A Precious Collection of the Songs of the Master Herukafrum gTsang that Shows the Path of the All-Knowing One, the Powerji1/ King). 41"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the collection states that it was compiled (sbyar) by rGod tshang ras pa and that gTsang smyon's female companion Kun tu bzang rna was responsible for the arrangement (bkod), and for sponsoring the printing (spar du bzhengs) of the collection.185 The songs were originally issued as a separate collection, but both rGod tshang ras pa and Lha btsun included the songs in their rnam thars. rGod tshang ras pa also compiled a short--one and a half folios long-catalogue of gTsang smyon's song collection with the title Il-luminating Sunbeams Catalogue.186 The songs are included in the parts of the rnam thars that describe the lat-er period of gTsang smyon's life. They were often sung to a certain disciple or benefactor, sometimes in response to specific questions or situations. The setting in which a song occurs is generally given, and this narrative frame makes it possible to determine that the songs originated in the last twenty-five or so years of gTsang smyon's life. Since the focus of the present study is on gTsang smyon's first thirty years, and the songs were sung in a suc-ceeding period, I will not devote much attention to them. It should, however, be remembered that it is possible that gTsang smyon also sang songs during the first thirty years of his life. On a few occasions such songs are referred to in the rnam thars. 187 But, before his thirties gTsang smyon had not yet ob-tained the fame and support of later days, and without followers, disciples and benefactors any songs he may have sung were probably never remem-bered or written down. 188 Well aware of the difficulties of determining the authorship of the songs, I find it quite reasonable to assume that they originated from gTsang smyon. Subsequently those who wrote them down perhaps modified them. gTsang smyon was, after all, a very learned person with great literary skill and he was also well versed in the art of composing songs. His own works are dis-tinct proof of this, and he also had many followers who could remember and record his possible songs. The Brief Life Stories Besides the songs and the three extensive rnam thars that his direct disciples wrote, a few short life stories of gTsang srnyon are available. I have found two short summaries of Heart of the Sun and there are probably more texts of this kind to be found. The most interesting example is a short rnam thar 185 gTsang smyon: 27b.

This indicates that some of the songs were sung in his late twenties, perhaps when he was twenty-nine (L: 50, 51, 53-54). . 188 It is mentioned in the Heart of the Sun that gTsang smyon sang songs that were not wntten tlown already in his early twenties (G: 40). 42"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"written by the dGe lugs pa scholar Th.u'u bkwan bLo bzang chos kyi nyi ma (Thu'u bkwan, 1737-1802).189 Thu'u bkwan included this short rnam thar of gTsang smyon at the be-ginning of a rnam thar he wrote about his famous lama; !Cang skya Ye shes bstan pa'i sgron ma, alias Rol pa'i rdo rje (1717-1786). gTsang smyon's rnam thar is included in a section that describes !Cang skya's previous lives.190 The reason for this is that !Cang skya stated that he was an incarna-tion of gTsang smyon.191 Thu'u bkwan's rnam thar of gTsang smyon is help-ful since he, unlike rGod tshang ras pa, writes in a Tibetan that adheres to both grammatical and spelling rules. Therefore, some problematic passages ofrGod tshang ras pa's text are more easily understood when Thu'u bkwan's text is consulted. It is also interesting to see how Thu'u bkwan summarizes rGod tshang ras pa's extensive text. What he chose to mention and what he chose to omit tells something about how he read the Hearl of the Sun and what he considered to be the most important events in gTsang smyon's life. The fact that he himself is a well-known dGe lugs pa scholar and the fact that his famous lama Rol pa'i rdo rje was considered an incarnation of gTsang smyon also shows that gTsang smyon was accepted, not only by some marginalized and eccentric bKa' brgyud yogins in the l61h century, but also by the members of the dGe lugs pa elite several centuries later.192 The Lion of Faith dNgos grub dpal 'bar wrote a life story called: The Common Life Stmy oft he Venerable One of gTsang-The Great Heruka: The Lion of Faith Playing on the Sno~y Mountain of Good Qualities.193 The title indicates that this rnam thar is a general or common rnam thar (thun mong gi rnam thar) bu·t, as already mentioned, this kind of categorization is rather arbitrary. Despite its name, in addition to the expected biographical information it deals with vi-sions, dreams and other things that are usually associated with the so-called uncommon or secret life stories. 189 I refer to it in the footnotes with the letter \"T\", and it is listed in the Bibliography under Thu'u bkwan bLo bzang chos kyi nyi rna 1989. 190 T: 39-45. 191 T: 39.

The fact that both Thu'u bkwan and Khetsun Sangpo have used rGod tshang ras pa's text indi-cates that this text was more widely available than the other two rnam thars, at least in more recent years. 193 rle btsun gtsang pa he ru ka'i thun mong gi rnam thor yon tan gyi gangs ri Ia dad pa'i seng ge rnam par rise ba.

As said above, it was probably used as a major source by both rGod tshang ras pa and Lha btsun.198 dNgos grub dpal 'bar's text is therefore a natural starting point for studying gTsang smyon 's life. At the beginning of the text dNgos grub dpal 'bar explains why and how the life story came about. As for how this life story [came about]: When I was on the outskirts of Zal mo brag in dBus, and the Great Venerable One [gTsang smyon] was cutting through [our] conjectures about the oral instructions of the profound mean-ing, the heart-sons, the close disciples, exhorted me by saying: \"You must compose a life story of the Lord.\"199 Based upon [this urge], I offered [my] corrections in front of the Great Venerable One so that he could give me permission (dgongs gro{) and clarify my doubts. Most of the root-verses [of the rnam thar] were completed in the first fif-teen-day period200 of the first month201 in the Female Fire-Rabbit year ( 1507). Then again, later on, the close disciples came and insistently ordered that [I] must compose an explanation [to the root-verses]. Based on that I com-piled the main part of the life story from what I heard from the master him-self, some originating from reliable sources and other things from reasonable argument. 202 194 N: 30b. bSam gtan gling is described briefly in Gyurme Dorje 2004: 328. 19' N· 30b· Smith 200 J· 74 196 S~me ;cholars have.made brief references to it (Smith 200 I: 74; Quintman 2006: 191-192, n. 8; Schaeffer, forthcoming). 197 NGMPP reel no.

It is interesting to note that dNgos grub dpal 'bar also received profound instructions in Zal mo brag on an earlier occasion according to the life story (p. 9a). On that occasion gTsang smyon told his secret life story (p. 9a). See also rGod tshang ras pa who mentions that dNgos grub dpal 'bar was with gTsang smyon and others in Zal mo brag at the end of gTsang smyon's life (G: 256). 200 Literally, \"white direction\", Tibetan dkar phyogs.

Each of the, in all, fifteen verses have four lines, and each line has nine syllables. As dNgos grub dpal 'bar explains above, the text itself is an explanation or commentary on the root-verses, and the root-verses thus form the skeleton of the text. At the end of the text, before the colophon, dNgos grub dpal 'bar repeats the five invocations that are also found at the beginning of the text. The root verses, as we have seen above, were composed a year before their explanations, when gTsang smyon was still alive. Then he completed the rnam thar-a synopsis of the verses with their explanations-in 1508, when gTsang smyon had passed away. After having explained how and why the rnam thar was composed, the general outline (sa bead) of the text is given.204 The rnam thar consists of three main sections each of which has several subheadings. The introductory section ('jug pa'i yan lag, 2b-3a) is divided into an explanation of the name of the text (mtshan smos pa, 2b), and an expression of worship (mchod par brjod pa, 2b-3a). The expression of wor-ship is subdivided into a general and a specific expression of worship. The main part of the text is the second major section that the author calls \"the actual life story\" (rnam par thar pa dngos, 3a-30a). This part is di-vided into two subsections: \"the synopsis in sections\" (Ius mdor bstan pa, 3a) and \"the extensive explanation in branches\" (yan lag rgyas par bshad pa, 3a-30a). It is in the second part that the actual life story is found. The second part is divided into two sections with several subsections. The two sections are: \"How he took birth as an emanation in a distinguished fam-ily as had been prophesied, and became ordained\" (3a-5b), and: \"How he embodied the three deeds and caused the teaching to flourish\" (5b-30a).205 As the titles of the sections make clear, the first describes prophecies, dreams and signs in connection with gTsang smyon's entering of the womb and the pregnancy of his mother. Then, dNgos grub dpal 'bar explains why it is suitable to associate these prophecies and dreams with gTsang smyon. {rlsom) ~gas zhes bskul ba Ia brten I tje btsun chen po 'i drung du dgongs grol dang I dogs gcod gy1 zhus dag phu/ I me nv yos kyi lo cho 'phrul chen po 'i dkar phyogs Ia I rtsa tshig phal mo che grub bar byas yang ba I phyis su 'ang thugs sras bu slob rnams /..yis I 'grel pa brtsom {rlsom) dgos pa 'i bka' lung nan gyis phebs pa Ia rten I rnam par thar pa phal che ba rnams ni I rje btsun nyid Ia dngos su thos pa dang I 'ga' zhig ni yid ches pa las rgyud de thos pa dang I gzhan dag ni rgyu mtshan dang bcas pa 'i gtan tshigs las nges pa rnyed pa rnams I 'fthyogs gcig lu bri bar bya'o I. 03 I have included the root-verses as an appendix, both in translation and in Tibetan (Appen-dix 2). 204 For a general outline of the text, see Appendix 3 205 . • N: 3a. 1: lung bstan dang bcaste ngs khyadpar can du sprul pa 'i sl.:yebabzhes nas rab tu byung /shu/, 2: mdzad pa gsum gyi Ius ngos bzung ste bstan pa spru/tshu/. 45"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Following this, gTsang smyon's birth and childhood are described, and the section concludes with an account of his ordination. The second section: \"How he embodied the three deeds and caused the teaching to flourish\" constitutes the major part of the rnam thar (5b-30a) and the first of the three deeds describes \"how he planted the victory banner of accomplishment.\" This deed concerns how gTsang smyon practised and attained accomplishment (5b-9b). The second deed is \"how he made con-nections by means of conduct\", and this describes how he spread the teach-ings and helped beings (9b-17b ). The third and final deed is divided into two parts. The first part describes how he renovated the Svayambhu Stiipa ( 17b-23a), and the second part how he passed away in order to help those who cling to permanence (23a-30a). The rnam thar ends with the third major section (30a) that, despite its name, actually consists of a repetition of the invocations that are also found at the beginning of the rnam thar. Finally, various colophons follow (30b-3la). Before continuing with the next two main sources, a few words about the author of Lion of Faith will be given. The text's author, dNgos grub dpal 'bar (born about 1460?), is an unknown figure, and no rnam thar of him has been traced.206 I also do not know of any other work written by him.207 His name is, however, mentioned in some of the texts that belong to the \"school of gTsang smyon\",208 and he seems to have been one of gTsang smyon's main disciples.2\"9 dNgos grub dpal 'bar probably met gTsang smyon rather early in gTsang smyon 's life and he figures as one of gTsang smyon 's early students. All three rnam thars contain sections describing how dNgos grub dpal 'bar received instructions from gTsang smyon in rDzong dkar chos de in 'Bras yul when gTsang smyon was on his way to La phyi.210 Lha btsun states that this meeting occurred when gTsang smyon was thirty-eight, and if this is correct the meeting occurred in 1489.211 Both rGod tshang ras pa and Lha btsun mention that dNgos grub dpal 'bar was a very learned scholar who had obtained the rab 'byams pa title.212 This 206 Smith 2001:288, n. 179. 207 Schaeffer does not include any other work by or about dNgos grub dpal 'bar among the fifty-five extant prints of gTsang smyon and his disciples that he has traced (Schaeffer, forth-coming). It is however possible that he wrote other texts, and perhaps more texts written by dNos grub dpal 'bar will be found someday. 208 For information about \"the school of gTsang smyon\", see Chapter 9. 209 Sangs rgyas dar po dpal bzang counts him among the most exalted great sons (khyad par du 'phags pa 'i bu chen) (Sangs rgyas dar po dpal bzang 1568: 79b). rGod tshang ras pa pays homage to him and the other main disciples G: 262. 210 G: 133; L: 93; N: 15b-16a. 211 L: 93. A meeting between Lha btsun and gTsang smyon that occurred when Lha btsun was sixteen is described in Lha btsun's rnam mgur. This would mean that their meeting occurred around 1489 so maybe Lha btsun was present when dNgos grub dpal 'bar met gTsang smyon vhe Life and Songs ofLha btsun 1976: 182). 12 G: 133; L: 93. 46"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"title was granted to great scholars who had studied extensively, and gTsang smyon's root lama Sha ra ba also held the title. Georges Dreyfus points out that the rab 'byams title was awarded after a scholar had studied the relevant texts, often with several teachers in various centers, and he also mentions that Sangs rgyas dpal, a student of Ngor chen dkun dga' bzang po (1382-1477) is said to have been the first to obtain the title.213 The title thus informs us that dNgos grub dpal 'bar was a learned man, and this is further empha-sized by Sangs rgyas dar po dpal bzang who uses the title pal) chen before dNgos grub dpal 'bar's name in his history of the bKa' brgyud tradition.214 So does Bya bra! pa Tshul khrims dpalldan in his rnam thar ofbSod rnams blo gros.215 Pal) chen is a Tibetanized form of the Sanskrit mahtipa~zdita, which is a title used in India for the most learned scholars. Since many years of studies must have been needed to obtain such a title of learning, dNgos grub dpal 'bar ought to have been at least in his mid twenties when he met gTsang smyon. Smith is inclined to place his birth in the period between 1462 and 1472, and if he indeed was a learned rab 'byams when he met gTsang smyon, as the sources state, I would suggest that the earlier date is more probable. 216 As mentioned, Lha btsun states that dNgos grub dpal 'bar was among many dge bshes who had assembled for teachings in rDzong dkar chos sde. He continues to describe that gTsang smyon granted the scholars \"pointing out instructions\" based on the Four Letter Mahamudra, and after that gave dNgos grub dpal 'bar profound instructions in private. Having practised according to the profound instructions, dNgos grub dpal 'bar obtained ex-traordinary results, Lha btsun informs us.217 dNgos grub dpal 'bar himself mentions that he received many instructions from gTsang smyon, and he also describes how gTsang smyon was able to demonstrate his own profound realization of dharmakaya both to him and to his other disciples.218 In the colophon to the Lion of Faith, dNgos grub dpal 'bar, with traditional mod-esty, presents himself as a Buddhist monk (shakya 'i dge slong).219 rGod tshang ras pa is less moderate and salutes him as \"the best monk, the king of learned ones.'0220 That dNgos grub dpal 'bar indeed was a learned person is evident when one reads the rnam thar. The spelling and grammar are flawless and he structures the text strictly according to formal rules.

As seen above, the introductory section of the text states that he was asked to com-pose the rnam thar by gTsang smyon's close disciples, and he was probably asked to do so because he was a great scholar and therefore suitable for the task. The Heart of the Sun rGod thang ras pa221 wrote a rnam thar titled: The Heart of the Sun, which Clarijies Vajraytina: The Life Story of gTsang smyon Hentka, Completely Victorious in Every Direction.222 Although we are not informed what rnam thar category this text belongs to, the title reveals that it is a life story that clarifies Vajrayana, and since Vajrayana is the \"Secret Mantra: Vajra Vehi-cle\" (gsang sngags rdo rje 'i theg pa), the title, somewhat vaguely, suggests that the life story belongs to the secret category (gsang ba 'i rnam thar). If one compares rGod tshang ras pa's rnam thar with the other two texts, the main difference does not concern secrecy or visionary accounts, however. Instead what distinguishes it from them is that it is the most comprehensive version. In the 146 folios rGod tshang ras pa appears to have included all the various sources that he had at his disposal, and thereby providing a more detailed account of gTsang smyon's life than both dNgos grub dpal 'bar and Lha btsun did. Besides including the songs found in gTsang smyon's song collection, he also included most of the information found in dNgos grub dpal 'bar's text, and to this he adds some letters, lists, a travel document and many stories and details that are lacking in the more abbreviated descriptions of gTsang smyon's life. It has been noted that rGod tshang ras pa 's text is historically the most interesting, and many names of places and persons and other significant details that are absent in the other rnam thars are noted in the text. 223 Of the three rnam thars about gTsang smyon this particular text is the most well-known and referred to. One of the reasons for this is that the text was published in 1969 with a preface by E. Gene Smith.224 In his preface Smith summarized the contents of the book's fifteen chapters and thereby made its contents available to English readers.

According to the colophon the text was completed on the fifteenth day of a Monkey year.m Unfortunately it does not specify which Monkey year, so it could refer to 1512, 1524 or 1536.226 Roberts mentions that the life story that Lha btsun wrote in 1543 directs those interested in knowing more about what happened when gTsang smyon passed away to more comprehensive accounts written by Lha btsun's great former dharma brothers.227 According to Roberts, the texts referred to are probably the rnam thars by dNgos grub dpal 'bar and rGod tshang ras pa.228 If this is the case, rGod tshang ras pa must have written his life story before 1543 when Lha btsun wrote his ver-sion of the life story. Ehrhard suggests that rGod tshang ras pa composed the text in 1512 while he was staying in Tsari.229 Due to its many peculiar spelling variations and disdain for the conven-tions of literary Tibetan, the Hearl of the Sun is rather difficult to read. Smith once pointed out that \"the orthographical substitutions found in the text are numerous enough to be the subject of a special study in itself.\"230 As will be seen in the footnotes and Appendix I, where sections of the Tibetan text is presented, rGod tshang ras pa often uses prefixes, suffixes, subscripts and superscripts that are not found in dictionaries.231 He also often excludes pre-fixes, suffixes, subscripts and superscripts. It is generally rather easy to as-certain what word rGod tshang ras pa must have had in mind, both from the contents of the story, and also by consulting dictionaries and looking at words with similar spelling. For example, he writes skyed rims instead of bskyed rim, nga brgyal instead of nga rgyal, srid zhu instead of sri zhu and sleng ba instead of gleng ba. After a while one becomes familiar with rGod tshang ras pa's non-standard spellings and unusual grammar, and it becomes easier to comprehend the rnam thar. As is common in many rnam thars, the prose style is highly colloquial and unadorned,232 but rGod tshang ras pa does insert sections of more poetic language that approximates classical literary Tibetan. In the poetic passages that occur, \"the poetical aesthetics is based on parallel structure and metric pattern found in folk and epic literature\" and not on the classical sloka.m 225 G: 284. 226 This has been discussed in Roberts 2007: 42. 227 Roberts 2007: 41; L: 127. 228 Roberts 2007: 41. 229 Ehrhard, forthcoming c. 230 Smith 2001: 67. 231 In the Tibetan texts l have included parentheses that show the words spelled as I have understood them.

Chapters six, seven and eight describe how gTsang smyon be-came a mad yogin and his subsequent activities as a mad yogin. Many cita-tions from, and references to, these three chapters are included in the disser-tation, and I have therefore chosen to present these three chapters in their entirety in Appendix 1. rGod tshang ras pa, just like the other authors, follows a chronological or-der that is quite straightforward when he describes the life of gTsang smyon. He provides us with few dates, but he does mention the passage of seasons and sometimes gives information about how many years and/or months gTsang smyon stayed at various places.235 Smith writes that although no at-tempt to establish even the simplest chronological outline of gTsang smyon's life has been made it would be possible to make such a compilation if the three rnam thars and the mgur 'bum were compared with one another and also with rnam thars of gTsang smyon's contemporaries.236 The Life Story which Causes the Body-Hairs of the Faithful to Flutter Lha btsun Rin chen rnam rgyaF37 wrote a life story called The Ltfe Story of the Siddha, the Madman from gTsang, which Causes the Body-Hairs of the Faithful to Flutter.238 The text is 65 folios long and was printed for the first time in Brag dkar rta so in 1543.239 According to the Life and Songs of Lha btsun/40 the life story was begun when Lha btsun and other disciples stayed with gTsang smyon in the Chu bar area. After having received instructions the disciples went to various places to practice; Lha btsun went to Brag dmar 'chong lung and was told to return after ten days. Lha btsun seem to have forgotten the days, and after 234 Smith's summary is very usefi1l when studying rGod tshang ras pa's text (Smith 2001: 63-67). 235 rGod tshang ras pa provides us with the date of birth (1452), the year when he made a one year meditation retreat in Chu bar (1495) and the date for the renovation of the Svayambhu Stupa ( 1504 ). He erroneously provides the year 1543 as the year when gTsang smyon passed away (It should be 1507). I will return to this when describing gTsang smyon's death in Chap-ter 7. 236 Smith 200 I: 63.

At that time he happened to see a draft of a rnam thar written by another close disciple, and when looking at it, he felt strong devotion towards his lama. After this, gTsang smyon told Lha btsun about his experience of liberation in sTag tshang. Lha btsun became very happy and limitless devotion arose. He then, full of tears, offered many pros-trations and asked gTsang smyon to continue his liberation story. gTsang smyon agreed to do so, but told Lha btsun not to reveal his story in front of many people. Lha btsun wrote down gTsang smyon's story in verses. In this way Lha btsun gradually wrote down a draft to a rnam thar in verses based upon what gTsang smyon dictated to him.242 The L~fe Stmy which Causes the Body-Hairs of the Faithful to Flutter has been published at the beginning of bDe mchog mkha' 'gro snyan rgyud (Ras chung snyan rgyud): Two manuscript collections of texts from the yig cha of gTsang smyon He ru ka.243 The rnam thar that is reproduced in this particular collection does not come from the original Brag dkar rta so edition, however, but from another print.

It has no chapters or sections, like the Heart of the Sun, but organizes the narrative around verses like the Lion of Faith. The forty-one verses are four lines in length, each line containing nine syllables. Like the verses in the Lion of Faith, they end with the verb 'dud (\"bow down\", \"pay homage\"). As seen above, it appears that Lha btsun first wrote the verses and later added the narrative parts and inserted the songs at the appropriate places in the rnam thar.

This is not surprising; several great masters of Tibetan Buddhism are described as having a special relation to the Perfection of Wisdom. These teachings form the core teachings of Mahayana Buddhism and have always been regarded as very important in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Lha btsun quotes a section of the Immaculate Goddess Siltra where it is written that;257 There are prophecies of the revered lama, the Heruka, in many deep Prajiiaparamitasutras. Especially in the Immaculate Goddess Sii.tra it is said: \"Prajiiapiiramitii will spread from the north to the north by myself, and fur-thermore in the land of the red faced ones [a person] with the name 'Mad-man' will spread Prajiiaparamita, and he will specifically not do so by means of discipline.''258 dNgos grub dpal 'bar, quoted the same text, but the last line that says that a person with the name \"Madman\" will spread the teaching is not men-tioned.259 Without the last line it becomes much more difficult to connect this siitra with gTsang smyon. dNgos grub dpal 'bar seems aware of this and explains that: The reason for letting these prophecies of the Perfection of Wisdom tum into prophecies about the Venerable One is that he is one who passed his time bringing his own as well as others' continuums to maturation and liberation by means of the view, meditation, conduct, and results which are explained in the profound Perfection of Wisdom Sfitras.260 256 G: 6: e ma hoI 'di skad du I bcom /dan 'das kyis mdo dkon mchog brtsegs par I kun dga 'o [kun dga · bo] nga nyid ma 'ongs pa 'i dus na rdo rje slob dpon gyi gzugs kyi chos ston par 'gyur ro I Ices pa dang I bla ma 'i yon tan yongs bzung gi rgyud las I I ji /tar mos pa 'i gzugs su ston I I nga nyid /nga brgya tha ma 'i tshe I I byis pa 'i gzugs kyi dam chos ston I Ices dang I mkha' 'gro rna rdo rje gur gyi rgyud las I I gangphyir rdo rje 'dzin pa ni I I de nyid slob dpon IJJ-,ugs bzung ste I I sems can phan rtogs dmigs nas ni I I tha mal pa 'i gzugs su gnas I I. 57 A text with a similar title-Lha mo dri med 'od kyis zhus pa, Vimalaprabhapariprccha-is contained in the bKa' 'gyur, vol. pain the mdo section, vol. 59. 258 L: 4: rje btsun bla rna he ru ka 'di nyid shes ph yin zab mo 'i mdo las mang du lung stan ni zhing I khyad par /ha mo dri med ma 'i mdo las I shes rab kyi pha rot du ph yin pa byang phyogs nas byang phyogs su nga nyid kyis rgyas par byed cing I de yang gdong dmar can gyi yul du smyon pa 'i ming can gyis shes rab kyi ph a rot du ph yin pa rgyas par 'gyur te I 'dul ba snving por byed pa ni rna yin no zhes gsungs pas I. 25~ N: 3a. 260 N: 3b: sher ph yin gyi lung stan de I rje btsun 'di nyid kyi lung stan du 'gro ba 'i rgyu mtshan ni I rje 'di nyid sher ph yin zab mo 'i mdo nas bshad pa 'i Ita bsgom spyod 'bras kyis I rangrgyudsmin cing lgzhan rgyud smin gro/ Ia 'god pa'idus 'da' ba cig 'dug pas I. 56"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"gTsang smyon thus proved to be the very person indicated in the sacred scripture through his activities. dNgos grub dpal 'bar mentions that he asked gTsang smyon whether it was appropriate to regard him as the very individ-ual mentioned in the prophecies. Not only did gTsang smyon reply that this was indeed appropriate, he also quoted some sections of the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra where it is said that the Prajiiaparamita teachings would be diffused not by a monk but by a yogin, and that the main subject of those teachings will not be discipline.261 According to the Heart of the Sun, also the Great Master from UQQiY,ana (Padmasambhava) whom Tibetan Buddhists consider to have been instru-mental in bringing Buddhism to Tibet, had foretold gTsang smyon's appear-ance. rGod tshang ras pa mentions that the treasure finder (gter stan) Byang chub gling pa262 revealed a treasure text (gter ma) entitled rDzogs chen baku Ia byang phra mo from the back of the great rNam snang263 in bSam yas, and he quotes from the treasure text in the Heart of the Sun: In the future, when the life span of beings will be fifty years, my-Padma's--emanation-body will be born in the sMyang-family, in a Monkey year, and [due to] \"disciplined conduct\" he will be called madman. [By mere-ly] seeing, hearing, thinking, or touching him, enlightenment will be at-tained.264 The gter ma texts often contain prophecies, and it is interesting that rGod tshang ras pa uses this kind of text to further sanctify his teacher.

Given the fact that many bKa' brgyud masters had close ties to the rNying rna school, in combination with the general tendency to mix traditions in Tibetan Buddhism, especially bKa' brgyud and rNying rna, it is somewhat surprising that there are so few connections between gTsang smyon and the rNying rna tradition. The fact that gTsang smyon's own student and biographer rGod tshang ras pa had close ties to the rNying rna tradition makes this even more surprising. It would seem logical to find more references to rNying rna teachings and/or rNying rna masters in the rnam thars about gTsang smyon but, as we will sec, there arc very few such references. 57"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The examples above show how gTsang smyon's disciples, in similar but not identical ways, try to demonstrate that their master was not an ordinary being, but an emanation (sprul pa) of enlightenment.

It also does not contradict U ryan's [Urgyan=Padmasambhava] prophecy, be-cause in general it is said that a single basis for emanation will emanate into one billion emanations, and in particular because it is prophesied that U ryan pa himself is an emanation of the Buddha.266 Previous Incarnations gTsang smyon is not only seen as an emanation (sprul pa) of a buddha, but he is also often held to be an incarnation (sprul sku) of a particular Buddhist master. The sprul sku-system of spiritual transmission was increasingly gain-ing popularity when gTsang smyon's disciples wrote their hagiographies, and it is only natural that they tried to see their teacher as an emanation sprul pa and/or an incarnation sprul sku. 267 gTsang smyon seems to have been a bit skeptical towards the incarnation system. According to Gene Smith, gTsang smyon considered the emulation of the lives of the great masters of the past to be more important than the incarnation lineage to which a teacher belonged.268 That this indeed seems to be gTsang smyon's opinion is shown in one of his most important works, the L!fe of Milarepa. Peter Alan Roberts and others have pointed out that gTsang smyon's version of Milarepa's hagiography was the first to present the cot-ton-clad yogin as an ordinary being instead of an incarnation of a buddha?69 This innovation made it easier for ordinary persons to identifY with Mi-larepa, which probably contributed to the popularity of gTsang smyon's version. However, despite gTsang smyon's attempts to reduce the importance of the incarnation system, both he and his disciples had some thoughts about his former incarnations. According to the Buddhist way of thinking, every 266 N: 4a: u 1yan gyi lung stan dang yang mi 'gal te I phyir spnd gzhi gcig gis I sprul pa bye ba phrag lrgya s prul par bshad cing I khyad par utyan (urgyan) nyid kyang I sangs rgyas kyi s~rul pa yin par lung bstan pas so /. 2 7 For a discussion of how these two terms are used and how complicated the ideas about reincarnation and emanation are, see, for example, Roberts 2007: 231. 268 Smith 200 I: 61. 269 Roberts 2007: 58.

Therefore, it is logical that a great master such as gTsang smyon had been an important master in his previous incarnations as well. Several incidents in the life stories show how people speculated about gTsang smyon's previous lives. In the Heart of the Sun it is mentioned that Chos rje gYam spyil ba announced to gTsang smyon that he had dreamt that gTsang smyon was Tilopa in a previous life. gTsang smyon answered: \"That may indeed be your vision. I am [indeed] one who upholds the tradition of Tilopa. I have no idea whether I am an incarnation or not.'mo On another occasion the head lama of the gNya' nang monastery asked gTsang smyon: Precious Lord! Whichever activity of yours one observes, it is not worthy of any but one of the incarnations of a Buddha or Bodhisattva, whoever it may be. In the opinion of the people, it is such as the Reverend Lord Ras chung pa and Ngan rdzong stan pa. Concerning whose incarnation, the rumours are not in agreement, and there are various opinions. Which is it? Please tell whose incarnation you are, and who is the extraordinary master in Lord Mi Ia ras pa's Life.271 On this occasion gTsang smyon offered a response that provides some in-formation regarding his opinion. He said that, \"You will understand whose incarnation I am by looking at the footprint at Ras chen Cave in La phyi and the [identity of the] extraordinary master will become evident when I have died.\"272 This enigmatic answer did not stop the speculations about gTsang smyon's previous incarnations, but it did actually contain some clues. Ilze Maruta Stearns [Kalnins] and Andrew Quintman have shown that a close reading of the Heart of the Sun, where the above quotations are found, shows that gTsang smyon, in the eyes of rGod tshang ras pa, considered himself to be a reincarnation ofMilarepa.273 If this was solely rGod tshang ras pa's opi-nion, or if it actually was what gTsang smyon himself believed, is difficult to know.

Lha btsun thought that gTsang smyon had been Tilopa, for example.274 Steams [Kalnins] who has devoted attention to this question in her master's thesis argues convincingly that gTsang smyon shared rOod tshang ras pa's opinion and actually made it clear that he had been Milarepa previously.275 gTsang smyon never said this directly, but he did say and do things that, taken as a whole, indicate that this seem to have been his opin-ion. Due to gTsang smyon's vagueness regarding his previous incarnations, speculations about gTsang smyon's former lives continued. Several centuries later well-known lamas expressed different opinions about gTsang smyon's former incarnations. Thu'u bkwan bLo bzang chos kyi nyi rna (1737-1802) thought that he was a reincarnation of Milarepa's teacher, Marpa (1012-1093?).276 Later, two prominent figures of the non-sectarian movement (ris med), 'Jam mgon Kong sprul (1813-1899) and 'Jam dbyangs mKhyen brtse dbang po (1820-1892) stated that gTsang smyon was an incarnation ofRas ch ung pa. 277 To sum up, it was generally believed that gTsang smyon was a reincarna-tion of a great bKa' brgyud master of the past, but there was no consensus regarding who it was. Some people claimed that it was Ras chung pa or Ngan rdzong ston pa. rOod tshang ras pa and other disciples (and perhaps gTsang smyon himself), asserted that it was Milarepa; Lha btsun and Chos rje gYam spyil pa that it was Tilop!l; Thu'u bkwan that it was Marpa; mKhyen brtse dbang po and 'Jam mgon Kong sprul that it was Ras chung pa-and there were probably several other candidates as well. The Birth: Chos rgyallhun po-The Dharma King Mountain-is Born I bow down to you, who showed many miracles when you entered the womb and were born, And who in the amusing games of childhood endeavored in virtuous ac-tions.278 gTsang smyon was born in gTsang, the most western of the two provinces that constitute central Tibet (dBus-gTsang).

The most famous and important town in Myang is rOyal rtse, situated about 67 kilometers southeast of gZhis ka rtse in upper Myang. rOyal rtse is famous for the remarkable octagonal sKu 'bum Stiipa that was completed in 1427. The stupa is situated in the great monastic complex of rOyal rtse, dPal 'khor chos sde, or as it was called in the oldest references, dPal 'khor bde chen. If one follows the Myang chu river from rOyal rtse and continues north one arrives in sTag rtse. In sTag rtse there was a temple attributed to the ancient dharma king Khri srong Ide btsan, and in its territory was a locality called sTag tshal where there stood a castle known by the name of Mon 'gro.280 East of sTag rtse in a large valley was a village called mKhar kha or bKra shis mkhar kha.281 dPal !dan bzang po laid the foundations of this vil-lage (mKhar kha), rTse chen, Lhun grub rtse and gOyal rtse 1365.282 It was in mKhar kha that gTsang smyon Heruka was born. gTsang smyon's birth is described in a similar way in the three rnam thars, some details varying, but the overall picture being almost identical. Before Birth In the Heart of the Sun, rOod tshang ras pa desribes how Milarepa attained enlightenment in one lifetime, and it is then mentioned how Milarepa's aspi-ration prayers and his powerful resolve to benefit beings spread his enlight-ened activities in countless buddha fields. Finally, \"light of wisdom and compassion radiated from the spontaneously existing sphere of Akani~J:ha to this land of the northern direction (Tibet), and the great nirmaQ.akaya entered his mother's womb.\"283 The entire episode resembles Buddha Sakyamuni's b.irth, as it is depicted in the famous hagiographies Lalitavistara and Buddhacarita. Just like the Buddha, gTsang smyon dwelled in a heavenly sphere, not Tu~ita as the for-mer, but Akani~J:ha, and when the time was ripe he descended to Earth to enter the womb of his mother. gTsang smyon was thus seen as an extraordi-nary being, a bodhisattva or perhaps an emanation of a buddha, who took birth for the sole reason of benefitting beings and the teachings. 279 For information about Myang/Nyang see Tucci 1989 a: 4 7-72, for a more recent descrip-tion, see Gyurme Dorje 2004: 265-275. 280 Tucci 1989 a: 56, 68. 281 See Tucci 1989 b: 259, n. 3.

Her dreams and visions were regarded as very important by the authors of the rnam thars, and gTsang smyon himself seems to have had a close relationship with, and much respect for her. Even when gTsang smyon later became a mad yogin, famous for disregarding the opinions of others, he occasionally visited his mother and followed her advice. gTsang smyon's father, on the other hand, is only mentioned when gTsang smyon's birth is described and then disappears fi·om the account altogether. The close relationship between mother and son is also seen in other life stories, most notably perhaps the life of Milarepa, where the strong and emotional rela-tionship between Milarepa and his mother is an important part of the narra-tive. The importance of one's mother is often stressed in Mahii.yii.na Bud-dhism, and a common method to develop compassion is to see all sentient beings as one's previous mothers.286 Sangs rgyas 'dren and Sangs rgyas dPalldan had five children, three sons and two daughters. gTsang smyon was the next youngest of them, and his brothers are mentioned by name in the biographies. Gene Smith mentions that all three brothers became well-known religious personages of their time.287 Lha btsun depicts a dream that their mother had during her pregnancy with gTsang smyon's older brother Sog po rgyal mtshan: :w'hen the oldest of the three sons A ra pa tsatsha [Sogs po rgyal mtshan] was m the womb of mkha' 'gro Sangs rgyas 'dren, his mother one night dreamt of a red_ fearful woman with bone ~rn~ments.

If this is correct gTsang smyon's parents were Buddhist practitio-ners who had achieved recognition and perhaps officiated in the village when religious ser-vices were needed. That parents of an important lama are extraordinary individuals is taken for granted by many Tibetans, so it is difficult to know whether gTsang smyon's parents actually were regarded as accomplished practitioners before gTsang smyon was born, or if they were given such titles and/or fimctions retrospectively. 286 See, for instance, Kongtrul 1987: 12. 287 Smith 200 I: 63. 62"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"the time of talking arrived he automatically said A RA PA TSATSHA NA DHI/88 and was also given the name A ra pa tsatsha.289 gTsang smyon's younger brother, dKon mchog rgyal mtshan (born 1453) is often mentioned in the rnam thars, and just like gTsang smyon he was seen as an emanation foretold in prophecies. gTsang smyon had a close relation-ship with him, and the two brothers often traveled together. dKon mchog rgyal mtshan is often called dbon po or dbon po brten 'brei ba in the rnam thars, and this is confusing since dbon po usually means nephew.290 Stearns [Kalnins] assumes that this is either a scribal error, or that dbon po might be a local usage for younger brother.291 rOod tshang ras pa asserts that dKon mchog rgyal mtshan was an emanation of an activity protector (las kyi mgon po) called The Raven Faced One (Bya rog gdong).292 Not only gTsang smyon's parents and siblings were extraordinary, but the family (rigs) and lineage (gdung) to which they belonged were extraordinary as well. The name of the lineage was Myang and it had produced famous saints such as Myang ral pa can.293 During the pregnancy, gTsang smyon's mother (Sangs rgyas 'dren) felt happiness and physical lightness, and even if she did not eat she never felt hunger.294 She also had several dreams that indicated that her expected child was very special and destined for great things. This is another common fea-ture of rnam thars; the mother of the great female master Ma gcig lab sgron (1055-1153), for example, felt light and happy while pregnant. In addition, just like gTsang smyon's mother, she had auspicious dreams.295 A rnam thar about Ma gcig lab sgron describes that when her mother was pregnant, de-spite being a rather old mother (48 years), her complexion became youthful again.296 288 This is the mantra ofMafijusri. 289 L: 4-5: mkha' 'gro sangs rgyas 'dren Ia sras gsum 'khrungs pa 'i che baa ra pa tshatsha Ia 'khris pa 'i dus suI yum Ia nub cig gi mnal lam du bud med dmar mo rus pa 'i rgyan can jigs pa cig gis sgang dkar dmar 'thing gsum byin nas de za dang sag pa rgyal mtshan I sangs rgyas rgyal mtshan I dkon mchag rgyal mthan gsum skyes nas 'dzam gling grags pas 'gengs so zer ba rmi nas 'ja' /tar yal song I de nas sprug gu de btsam te smra ba'i dus tshod Ia s/eb pa 'i tshe a ra pa tsatsha na dhi rang b yung Ia smras nas I ming Ia yang a ra pa tsatsha ra btagssa /. 290 See, for instance, G: 7; 15; N: 4b. 291 Steams [Kalnins] 1985: 53, n. 27.

The many auspicious dreams that his mother had during her pregnancy did not cease after gTsang smyon's birth, but continued to appear and influence her. When gTsang smyon was eight months old a small boy with a beautiful voice appeared in a dream, sitting high above the ground among a large group of women who were adorned with bone ornaments and played hand drums (rj.amarz1). gTsang smyon's mother became afraid that the child would fall down to the ground and get hurt, but the small boy comforted her saying: \"Mother you do not need to worry; riding a white lion I sit in space.\"310 Hear-ing the young child say this Sangs rgyas 'dren (gTsang smyon's mother) woke up. One month later a severe case of tonsillitis threatened gTsang smyon's life and they consulted various doctors. No matter which skilful doctor was consulted, no one found any remedy, and his condition continued to get worse. Divinations were performed but no cure for the child was found. Then, one night, on the full moon day (the 15th), a white lady appeared in a dream and told Sangs rgyas 'dren that since the boy of hers was destined to benefit sentient beings and the Buddhist doctrine, recitation of mantra would cure him. His mother answered that she did not know what mantra to recite and the white lady said that it would suffice to recite the maryi mantra.311 When gTsang smyon 's mother woke up, she immediately did as the white lady in the dream had said and gTsang smyon was cured.312 The dreams of gTsang smyon's mother continued to appear, and as al-ready seen, these dreams were often prophetic. Significant Buddhist figures appeared and revealed important pieces of information about her son. The next important dream-visitor was the great master Padmasambhava. This key figure in Tibetan Buddhism, who is important in visionary revelations in Tibet, appeared in a dream on the lOth day of the Tibetan month when gTsang smyon was ten months old.m Surrounded by many l;lakinis, Padma-sambhava made the following statement: \"Outside of sTag tshal nang, my 309 G: 14; L: 5; N: 4a. 310 G: 14-15; L: 6-7; N: 4a-4b: amasdug bsngal byedmi dgos/ngasengge dkarmola zhon nas bar snang Ia sdad yod /. 311 Otrz ma~ripadme hwrr. 312 G· IS· L· 6· N· 4b 313 G.: 15'.

Another interesting thing revealed in this prophecy is the fact that gTsang smyon is once again said to be an emanation of the great master from U rgyan (Padmasambhava). The dream thus confirms the message of the above-quoted gter rna. Youth Later, when gTsang smyon was around one year of age317 he sat in fi1ll medi-tation position with his eyes fixed for twenty-one days.318 This was an indica-tion that the young child was a reincarnation of a great meditation master and was destined to become a yogin. When older, gTsang smyon practised much meditation and he stressed the importance of meditation practice in his teachings. The prophetic dreams continued to appear and the most important was perhaps a dream that his mother had when gTsang smyon was about one year old. A black man, adorned with bone ornaments and with his hair tied up in a topknot, appeared. The yogin opened the face(s) of the boy(s)319 and inserted several volumes of holy books in him (them).320 314 Literally, if a bird pulls a monkey-nose, meaning if someone of the bird sign leads some-one of the monkey sign. sPre sna b ya yis drangs nas. 315 G: 15: stag tshal nang gi ph yi ral nasI I nga yi sprul pa sprel Ia pa I I de 'i Ius kyis grib rna ni I I 'phag pa tshun chang thor lam thab I spre sna bya yis drangs nas ni I 'dzam gling 'ad kyi 'gengs par 'gyur /.

These kinds of mystical transmissions are common in both Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. They are of particular importance in the Tibetan treasure tradition (gter rna). In the treasure tradition a great master, usually Padmasambhava, gives a certain teaching to a particular disciple who in a later incarnation, when the right time and circumstances arise, discovers the same teaching as a treasure (gter rna) and thereby becomes a treasure re-vealer (gter ston).m This is an effective way of showing that seemingly new teachings are actually the words of a buddha. If the teaching is not new, like in the case of gTsang smyon and the Aural Transmission, it is a way of con-firming that the person in question has a mandate to function as a representa-tive of the great masters from whom the lineage once sprung. His mother's dream shows that gTsang smyon had been chosen by Tilopa to propagate these esoteric oral instructions. Later in his life, as we will see, gTsang smyon fulfilled his obligation, and the seed that Tilopa had planted in him when he was a small child bore fruit. Leaving the dreams and prophecies aside, let us now tum to the way in which gTsang smyon showed that he was extraordinary. As noted above he had already sat in meditation for a long period when he was just a baby. Lha btsun describes how he continued to surprise his surroundings with his un-usual behavior: When he was two years old, he sometimes stood up, holding his hands in prayer on top of his head, and spontaneously and repeatedly said, \"I salute the master Mi Ia (Milarepa)! I salute the glorious Phag mo grub pa!324 I salute the victorious rGod tshang pa!\"325 At the age of three, in all his children's games he was teaching dharma. In addition, after holding a small copper vase he said, \"I will bestow empower-ment,\" and he put it (the vase) on the heads of all, strong as well as weak. When he was four and five he was sitting in Vajra-posture most of the time, 321 1 will return to the Aural Transmission and describe it in more detail in Chapter 4 and Chapter 9. 322G: 16. m For a description of the treasure tradition written by a Tibetan lama, see Thondup 1997.

When he was seven, he thoroughly knew the writing styles and the different kinds ofletters.329 rGod tshang ras pa gives a somewhat similar account of gTsang smyon's extraordinary childhood. All his actions and games were related to the Bud-dhist doctrine and practice, and proved that he was linked to the dharma, or as expressed by rGod tshang ras pa, \"he showed that he carried the blessing of previous virtuous deeds\" (rnam dkar kyi las 'phro).330 This kind of behav-ior is often found in rnam thars dealing with the childhood of a great Tibetan master.331 In his autobiography 'Jam mgon Kong sprul describes how, as soon as he could walk, he started to wear a monk's shawl. Kong sprul con-tinues: In my childhood games, l would spend my entire time playing at bestowing empowerments, erecting miniature temples and ancient castles, making tor-mas out of earth, and performing forma rituals and lhasang ceremonies. When I saw such ritual implements as vajras and bells, I was extremely de-lighted. So there were many excellent signs of my connection with and pro-pensity toward the Buddhist teaching.332 The rnam thars about gTsang smyon thus follow the same pattern as many other rnam thars, something that is aptly illustrated in the following passage of the Heart of the Sun: Then when he was six years old, after gathering the children in various places such as mKhar kha'i skyid de phug and so forth, he played games of drawing ma~H;Ialas, arranging offerings, performing gaQacakra-feasts, preaching dhar-ma and so forth, and since all he did was the performance of a Vajra master, even ordinary persons were astonished and amazed.

Things that other beings strived to obtain gTsang smyon wanted nothing to do with. For him even the greatest happiness of samsara resembled food mixed with poison or a heap of filth full of f1ies.336 Samsara was like a \"pit of fire\" (me 'obs) in the young boy's eyes337 and not even the happiness of the highest god, Tshangs pa (Brahma), attracted him.333 gTsang smyon's renunciation was mixed with an equally strong feeling of compassion towards the beings who suffer in samsara. Motivated by renun-ciation and compassion he decided that whatever the cost he must obtain the state of peace, the highest liberation from samsara. Since he wanted to reach liberation in order to help all sentient beings who suffer in the various sam-saric realms, the limited liberation of the sravakas and pratyeka-buddhas did not satisfY him.

When gTsang smyon showed up the following day the abbot thought that his dream portended gTsang smyon's ordination and said: \"Last night I dreamt of throwing flowers to a man who was together with many friends who were arhats. It seems that this person will be of benefit for the teaching.\" [The abbot] was very compassionate and provided [gTsang smyon] with the requisites of a monk. Having given him the ordination name Sangs rgyas rgyal mtshan (Victory Banner of the Buddha), he said, \"You will be one who upholds the victory banner of the teachings.\"341 Not only the abbot had a dream in connection with the ordination ceremony, but, as so often before, gTsang smyon's mother dreamt a prophetic dream around the time of her son's ordination as well. She dreamt that her extraor-dinary son was herding cattle up a mountain,342 a dream that indicated that gTsang smyon had an important future mission. From this time onward Chos rgyal !hun po, as gTsang smyon had been called since birth, became Sangs rgyas rgyal mtshan, and he was no longer an extraordinary child, but an extraordinary monk. The young monk amazed everyone with his strict discipline and astonishing talent. During this period, both gTsang smyon and his mother continued to have prophetic dreams from time to time. The year after the ordination, when gTsang smyon was nine, he had a dream that indicated his connection with the tantric teachings, though this was not yet visible in his every-day behav-ior. In the dream, a black man gave him a hooked knife and spoke the fol-lowing symbolic words: \"All the beings you kill by performing wrathful activity will attain the path of liberation.\"343 The year after, another dream occurred that foretold gTsang smyon's fu-ture as a master who would spread the tantric teachings in various directions. In this dream, gTsang smyon arranged many offering cakes (gtor rna) and 340 There are some discrepancies in the sources concerning what type of vows he received from the mkhan po.

Inside was a burning mass of fire [situated] in a mansion made out of skulls. [There,] on a seat made of a lotus, sun, and corpse was a celestial per-son (sku) adorned with charnel-ground garments. When [gTsang smyon] woke up from the dream it was dawn and an un-bearable splendor of great wisdom [filled the place]. At that time, he saw the whole sky in front of him filled with light and in the expanse of a mass of wisdom fire, he met with the glorious Lord of Secrets345 in person. He had charnel-ground garments and was adorned with snakes. By the spreading and collecting of light [from the Lord of Secrets] empowerment was granted and after having given reading transmission (lung) of many tantras, such as Cak-rasarpvara and Hevajra [to gTsang smyon], the indigo blue light fused into one. Then it melted into the heart of the young bodhisattva.346 gTsang smyon's mother continued to have prophetic dreams and in one of her dreams she dreamt that her son blew a big white conch and that the sound pervaded the entire world.347 This dream also indicated gTsang smyon's future role as a master who would spread the Buddhist doctrine in the entire world. Another dream that had a palpable result occurred when gTsang smyon had reached his twelfth year. At that time a group of women appeared in a dream and offered him gold. The following day gTsang smyon found a large quantity of gold and his family became rich.348 All these many spectacular dreams dominate the description of gTsang smyon's early life in the rnam thars to such an extent that it is hard to know much about what happened when gTsang smyon was not asleep and dream-ing.

When gTsang smyon was thirteen, he made a small bag that he filled with deadly poison and hung around his neck. Then he made a solemn promise to swallow the poison if he ever violated his monastic vows. \"If swallowing this will not kill me, may Pafijaranatha remove my heart's blood,\" he added.350 Whenever some desire arose in the young monk's mind he just touched the bag around his neck and the desire disappeared. gTsang smyon's ability to guard his vows in this way made him a great example for other monks to follow, and he always \"guarded his perfect discipline like his own eyes.•>JSI Keeping his monastic discipline perfectly pure, he spent days and nights constantly reading scriptures, listening to teachings, and reflecting over the meaning of what he had heard and read. His only delight was dharma, and he always indulged in the ten dharma activities, namely: writing letters; making offerings; performing acts of generosity; listening to dharma; comprehend-ing; reading; explaining; recitation; contemplating the meaning of dharma; and meditating on the meaning of dharma.352 During this time gTsang smyon felt a strong urge to depart for the snowy enclave of La phyi, to indulge in intensive meditation practice.353 La phyi is a holy place situated on the Tibetan-Nepalese border, on a larger pilgrimage circuit, which traverses an area of related sites between the southern Ding ri plains, Chu bar in Brin to the east, and gNya' nang region to the west.354 The place is associated with the tantric cycle of Cakrasaqwara and the poet saint Milarepa.

He never managed to reach his ea-gerly longed-for destination, however, but was caught by his mother in Man lung.356 Back home in mKhar kha, gTsang smyon continued to study and practise with great diligence. rGod tshang ras pa describes how the young monk learned and understood both the Concise (bsDus pa) and the Eight-Thousand-line versions of the Perfection of Wisdom scriptures after just reading them through once.357 gTsang smyon also studied the most extensive, Hundred-Thousand-line version, of Prajnaparamita ('Bum). Every single day he learned eighty pages of the text by heart, and at night in his sleep, he tho-roughly understood the meaning of what he had memorized the previous day. This extraordinary way of learning came about because of gTsang smyon's propensities from former lives (bag chags); he did not need to learn anything new, but just rediscovered the knowledge he already had.358 gTsang smyon's skill in the Prajfiaparamita scriptures soon came to the attention of other people. When gTsang smyon and eight other monks were invited to perform ceremonies (bla mchod) by a family in the lower part of mKhar kha359 their host noticed that gTsang smyon read the Hundred-Thousand-line Prajfiaparamita with his eyes closed. This made him suspi-cious, and thinking that the young monk was a fraud, he asked him how he could read with closed eyes. gTsang smyon answered that as long as the correct words come out it does not matter if one_ reads with open or closed eyes. Since his host suspected that gTsang smyon was only pretending to read, gTsang smyon invited him to check. gTsang smyon covered his eyes so that he could not see the text and read by heart while the others checked in the text whether he read correctly or not. Not only did gTsang smyon read with perfect accuracy, but he was also able to read very fast. After the test, people became convinced that the young monk was genuine, and faith arose in them.

The trickster-like qualities and outrageous acts that later became his trademark are nowhere to be seen. Just a few dreams and visions indicate the young monk's future as a mad yogin. It should, however, be noticed that none of gTsang smyon hagiographers state that he became a fully ordained monk (dge s/ong, bhik~u). rGod tshang ras pa states that he became a novice monk (dge tshul, sriima~zera) and dNgos grub dpal 'bar that he became a monk (rab tu byung ba).366 According to Lha btsun, gTsang smyon only received the lay vows (dge bsnyen, upasaka), but he later also uses the more general term for becoming a monk-rab tu byung ba.367 This is of course not surprising at this point of the narrative, since novice ordina-tion is the first step for a monk, and since it is not customary to bestow full ordination on young boys. It is not until the novice reaches the age of about twenty that full ordination is to be taken. What is noteworthy is that gTsang smyon never took this next step, but instead became a wandering yogin. Since it is generally considered to be necessary and important for a Buddhist master in Tibet and elsewhere to become fully ordained, it is relevant that none of the three authors state that gTsang smyon ever became a fully or-dained monk. The Sixth Dalai Lama, Tshang dbyangs rgya mtsho ( 1683-1706), is another example of a famous Tibetan master who chose not to be-come fully ordained. This controversial incarnation of the Dalai Lama even-tually also gave up his status as a novice monk and became a layman, an act that seems to have shocked many Tibetans.368 Perhaps it was gTsang smyon's root lama who inspired him not to take full ordination, which would be a more natural step for a young and gifted novice. As we will see, his root lama, whom he had not yet met, was a tantric yogin with a consort.

According to this way of seeing it, Mahayana consists of a siitric and a tantric path.l11 Regardless of how Vajrayana is in-corporated within the Buddhist teachings, Tibetan Buddhists see Tantra as an advanced and secret path that must be combined with, and preceded by, Hinayana and Mahayana. This point is made clear by the way gTsang smyon practised; first he received the priitimok~a vows and renounced samsara, this is, the basis of Hinayana. Then his practice was based upon the dyad of wis-dom (prajna.) and compassion (karu~za), two main concepts of Mahayana Buddhism. Only after having studied and understood both Hinayana and Mahayana, did he start with advanced tantric practice. Thus gTsang smyon had entered and realized the core teachings of both Hinayana and Mahayana, the basis for Vajrayana practice, when still in his early teens. In the words of rGod tshang ras pa he had \"became like the moon among other monks, who were like stars.\"372 Now the time was ripe for the young monk to enter into \"the supreme mantra vehicle\" as the Vajra-yana is sometimes called, which leads us to the next section, where gTsang smyon's meeting with his root-lama will be described. 369 rDo rje theg pa 'igsal byed nyi rna 'i snyingpo. 370 lam aware of the fact that Hinayana is a polemic term coined by the Mahayana followers. Both these terms are problematic, but since they are widely used, both among Buddhists and academics, and since there have not yet appeared any good alternatives 1 use them.

For an example of how the three vehicles are understood by contemporary Tibetan Buddhists who base their explications upon Chogyam Trungpa's teachings, see Niilanda Translation Committee 1989: 295-298.

Seeing [his] face and hearing [his] voice, the profound meaning was instantly revealed and your minds mixed.374 After his failed escape to the holy La phyi, gTsang smyon continued to study vigorously in mKhar kha, as before. However, the signs and visions that previously had appeared and encouraged him to leave did not cease. On the contrary, they arose repeatedly, and when fifteen women appeared in a vi-sion and urged him to leave, he could not bear to stay. any longer. This time he took nothing at all with him, and he managed to escape without being caught.375 His destination was Tsari, a holy and isolated border area in the southeast frequented by yogins for their meditation practice.376 Like La phyi, Tsari is situated far from the power centers of Central Tibet, and both places are connected with the tantric deity Cakrasarp.vara. The fifteen women had ex-plicitly told gTsang smyon to go there,m and after four days of rapid travel, gTsang smyon arrived in Lhasa where he met three nuns who also were on a pilgrimage. They decided to join company and departed for Tsari together. On the way they passed through Dwags po, and in a place called La bar Zur mkhar, or simply Zur mkhar, situated at the northern gate (byang sgo) of Tsari, they met a famous physician named A pho chos rje mNyam nyid rdo rje (short: A pho chos rje, 1439-1475).378 A pho chos rje asked them where 373 gTsang smyon's main lama Sha rarab 'byams pa (1427-1470). 374 L: 9: dags po (dwags po) Ia bar zhes bya'i bskyed tshal (skyed tshal) du I sangs rgyas rnam sprul rab 'byams rje dang mjal I I zhal mthong gsung thos mas Ia zab mo 'i don I I mngon gyur thugs yid gcig tu 'gres (dres) Ia 'dud I. 375 G: 20; L: 9; N: 6a.

According to rGod tshang ras pa, he was eighteen (seventeen according to the Western way of counting, 1469) when he finally left, which would mean that he stayed for several years (G: 20). Lha btsun, on the other hand, says he stayed in mKhar kha only one year after being caught in Man lung, and he also states that the vision, or according to Lha btsun, the dream of the fifteen women, arose when he was fourteen years old. Since he escaped after that incident, he was fourteen at the time of his escape according to Lha btsun (L: 9). dNgos grub dpal 'bar gives no information about it, but simply states that gTsang smyon stayed for a while in mKhar kha before his final, and successful, escape (N: 6a). 376 For a detailed study ofTsari, see Huber !999. m G· 20· L· 9· N· 6a 378 A~co;di~g 'to Smi.th he was one of the greatest physicians of the Tibetan tradition and the first of the Zur mkhar school (Smith 200 I: 286, n. !51).

While the nuns continued on their pilgrimage, he stayed behind and recited Buddhist scriptures. Then, on the tenth day of the month, a ga~Jncakra was to be held in La bar.

Sha ra ba was in his early forties at the time, and passed away soon after he had guided gTsang smyon, who was in his late teens.382 In the Lion of Faith, it is described how Sha ra ba asked A pho chos rje about the identity of the young monk he heard reciting so beau-tifully.m After having been told the story, he ordered that gTsang smyon should be brought to him. By only meeting him and seeing his face, [gTsang smyon's] conceptions changed.

After that time, [gTsang smyon] said that he never experienced any notion of holding his own mind and the lama's mind as different. Then, in front [of Sha ra ba] was a wooden skull filled with leftover feast liquor (rna dana) that [Sha ra ba] gave [to gTsang smyon] who emptied it.384 The Lord [Sha ra ba] also became very happy and took care of [gTsang smyon].

It was comparable to taking back one's birthright. The emanation body (Sha ra ba) was pleased in his heart, and felt that there was an auspicious connection.389 Among the teachings Sha ra ba transmitted, the Aural Transmission of the bKa' brgyud school stands out as particularly important.390 gTsang smyon later spent much time practising and propagating these instructions, and he eventually composed a compilation of the various Aural Transmissions of the bKa' brgyud tradition.391 Since these instructions were so important for gTsang smyon and his disciples, some clarification and· information about them will be given before we continue. The Aural Transmission \"Aural transmission\" or \"hearing lineage\" (snyan brgyud), as the term also could be translated, is a generic term for a type of profound oral instructions dealing with tantric practice. Since snyan means ear and together with other words refer to what is heard, the tenn emphasizes the \"aural\" rather than \"oral\" or \"spoken\" (bka ') aspect of the teachings which is transmitted.392 Another translation that is sometimes used for the term, \"whispered lineage\", conveys that these instructions were considered very secret. It should also be noted that the transmission is conceived as being \"aural\" from the very be-ginning since a human lineage guru \"heard\" it directly from a dharmakaya wisdom qakinl. It should be noted that there are two different ways of spelling the term in Tibetan, snyan brgyud and snyan rgyud.

I will return with a more detailed discussion about r,Tsang smyon's Aural Transmission collection and its contents in Chapter 9. 92 The term \"bka' brgyud\" that nowadays is mainly used for the Buddhist tradition to which gTsang smyon belonged has a somewhat similar meaning, but this term emphasizes the \"words\" instead of the \"hearing\" of the words, and could thus be translated as \"command lineage\" or \"oral transmission\" 81"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"translated as \"aural/hearing lineage/transmission\", the latter spelling is more accurately translated as \"aural/hearing tantra\", a translation of the Sanskrit kar~zatantra. Although several different translated karf}atantra texts are found in the Tibetan canon393 it is possible that the texts are not translations but examples of what Ronald Davidson calls \"grey texts\".394 This would mean that they are neither Tibetan nor Indic in origination but the result of collaboration between an Indian!Nepalese/Kashmiri siddha/scholar and a Tibetan.395 It should moreover be noted that rgyud is sometimes a variant spelling of brgyud, and if that is the case here, the two terms have an identi-cal meaning and the most probable alternative would be \"aural transmis-sion\".396 It is important to be aware of the fact that there are many different aural transmissions and that several of them have nothing to do with the Aural Transmission of the bKa' brgyud school. Cyrus Stearns gives an apt descrip-tion of the aural transmissions in his study of the early masters of the Path with the Result (lam 'bras) tradition in Tibet, and it is striking how similar the aural transmissions of the Sa skya and the bKa' brgyud schools seem to be. In contrast to the voluminous exegetical literature surrounding the tantric scriptures themselves, the major systems of esoteric practice entered Tibet primarily by means of secret oral transmissions (snyan brgyud). Although these systems were essentially oral in nature, in most cases there were also at least a few written texts from India, the most fundamental of which were of-ten referred to by the term rdo rje tshig rkang, \"vajra verses.\"397 As Steams makes clear, the core teachings of the aural tantra/transmission are the \"vajra verses\", or \"adamantine verses\" as I have translated it. In the bKa' brgyud tradition this core text is believed to contain the Adamantine Verses (rdo 1je 'i tshig rkang) that Vajradhara uttered to Jiiana<,lakini (Ye shes mkha' 'gro).398 Tilopa later received them directly from the c_iakinis and then wrote a short text related to the Adamantine Verses titled The Small Authoritative Scripture.399 Several different names are used for these instruc-tions in the bKa' brgyud school, for example: \"Aural Transmission of 393 For a list of the kar~tantra texts found in the Tibetan canon, see Torricelli 1998: 386. 394 Davidson 2005: 148-151. 395 Davidson 2005: 149. 396 Roberts is of another opinion, however, and states that a number of Tibetan authors explic-it',Y retain the spelling rgyud to mean tantra (Roberts 2007: I). 39 Steams 200 I: 8. 398 Torricelli has translated a synopsis of the outline of the Adamantine Verses (Toricelli 1998: 388-412. 399 gZhung chung.

Marpa later praised the Aural Transmission (Hearing Lineage) in the fol-lowing way: Although everyone has a lineage, If one has the 9akin1 hearing lineage, that is it. Although everyone has forefathers, If one has Tilopa, that is it. Although everyone has a guru, If one has Naropa, that is it. Although everyone has oral instructions, If one has the hearing lineage, that is it. Although everyone attains enlightenment by meditating, If one becomes enlightened without effort in meditation, that is it.406 Marpa also pointed out that the Aural Transmission was a special teaching that no one else possessed, and he called it a \"wish-fulfilling jewel\".407 In Tibet, Marpa transmitted these instructions to his main disciple and spiritual heir, Milarepa, who later, encouraged by a vision of Vajrayogini, wrote them down.408 Then Milarepa gave this profound transmission to three 400 bDe me hog snyan brgyud. 401 mKa' 'gro snyan brgyud. 402 bDe me hog kha' 'gro snyan brgyud. 403 Mar pa Chos kyi blo gros (ascr.) 1995: 35-45. 404 Lus med mkha' 'gro 'i chos skor dgu. 405 The nine teachings are presented in Mar pa Chos kyi blo gros 1995: 44; see also Nalandii Translation Committee 1986: 176.

He therefore told his disciple Ras chung pa to go to India and request the remaining five teachings from a holder ofNaropa's lineage. Ras chung pa went to India and received the teachings from the Indian master Tiphupa and brought them back to Ti-bet.412 The Aural Transmission of the bKa' brgyud tradition is said to have been a \"one-to-one transmission\" (gcig brgyud).413 The exact meaning of gcig brgyud in this context is somewhat unclear, but it seems to imply that some parts of these instructions were only allowed to be passed on to one disciple at a time for a certain period before being disseminated more widely. When Naropa gave Marpa these instructions he said, \"It should be a teaching re-stricted to a single lineage holder for thirteen generations.\"414 Despite Naropa' s \"command seal\" (bka' brgya) the Aural Transmission divided, as was seen above, into three different streams just a few generations later. Nevertheless, some parts of the instructions were perhaps only given to a single lineage holder. The command seal from Vajradhara that had restricted the dissemination of these instructions had expired when gTsang smyon 409 For a life story of sGam po pain English, see Jampa Mackenzie 1995.

Dar rna mdo sde died at a young age and by means a particular type of tansference practice ( 'pho ba) called grong 'jug he transmitted his consciousness to a pigeon ,and then from the pigeon to a dead brahmin boy who thus was brought back to life and became known as Tiphupa-\"The pigeon man\".

This view is not unique to gTsang smyon and his disciples, but also the root-text of the Aural Transmission and the hagiographies of other bKa' brgyud traditions emphasize the one-to-one nature of the Aural Transmission.

Unlike most other Bud-dhist traditions in Tibet, the Aural Transmission tradition of which gTsang smyon was a lineage holder was thus not dependent upon monks and monas-teries for its maintenance and dissemination. Dan Martin notes that it was \"esoteric in the sense that it existed independently of the public arenas of Buddhist teaching and could freely pass inside monastery walls and out again.\"416 Martin moreover states that \"Its existence outside the institutions, as well as its deliberate fostering of 'individual' spirituality, made it rather suspect in the eyes of some of the more scholastic leaders.\"417 The esoteric and non-institutional character of the aural transmission lineages contributed to their eventual obscurity and in many cases their disappearance. There are many examples that show that it is difficult to maintain transmission lineages without strong monastic and institutional support, and the Aural Transmis-sion lineage ofthe bKa' brgyud could be seen as an example ofthis.418 Instructions and Practice Besides the Aural Transmission, gTsang smyon received several other teach-ings from Sha ra ba many but not all of which were related to the Aural Transmission. Again, rGod tshang ras pa gives the most detailed account. He mentions that gTsang smyon obtained the reading transmissions (lung) of The Mountain Dharma Trilogy,419 The Three Freedom Vehicles,420 the Five-fold Mahamudra,421 the Six Dharmas of Naropa422 according to the traditions ofKarmapa, Yang dgon pa· (1213-1258), Urgyan pa (U rgyan rin chen dpal, 1230-1309) and 'Ba' ra ba (1310--1391), The innate Union,423 The Dohii Trilogy,424 The Six Dohii Treasures,425 The Laughing Bell of Equal Taste426 415 G: 159. More information about gTsang smyon's Aural Transmission compilation will be ~iven in Chapter 9. 16 Martin 2005: 66. 417 Martin 2005: 66. According to Martin, the Jndependence of monastic institutions resulted in it being less problematic to include both laypersons and women as bearers of the blessings of the lineage (Martin 2005: 66). 418 The Aural Transmissions of the bKa' brgyud have mainly survived in the 'Brug pa bKa' brgyud tradition, and the yogic and non-institutional lineages that gTsang smyon represented have more or less disappeared. 419 Ri chos skor gsum. 420 Thor gru skor gsum. 421 Phyag rgya chen po lnga /dan. 422 Niiro chos drug. 423 Lhan cig skyes sbyor. 424 Doha skor gsum. 425 Dohii mdzod drug. 426 Ro snyoms bgad dril (= Ro snyom skor drug?). 85"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"and Distinguishing the Adamantine Verses.421 rGod tshang ras pa also men-tions that gTsang smyon received the Innate Goddess428 empowerment and was given the name Mi bskyod rdo rje.429 Afler having received these reading transmissions and the empowerment, Sha ra ba began to instruct and guide gTsang smyon in a more direct, de-tailed, and personal way. During this period, gTsang smyon practised what he had been taught and then received more instructions. This resulted in many important insights and profound experiences. The teachings that formed the basis of the instructions that he received were the above-mentioned three teachings, or rather set of teachings: the Four Letter Mahamudra;430 the Six Dharmas of Naro; and the Aural Transmissions. It is important to be aware of the fact that these three groups of teachings are interrelated in several ways. A Four Letter Mahamudra text is found in the Aural Transmission collection that gTsang smyon later compiled,431 and the Six Dharmas of Naropa are an important part of the Aural Transmission, for example.432 This means that the Four Letter Mahamudra and the Six Dhar-mas of Naropa-inner heat, illusory body, dream, luminosity, transference and intermediate state-are included in the Aural Transmission, but they are also transmitted separately.4JJ Their close relationship is seen in the life story of Naropa by Lha btsun where each one of the Six Dharmas is followed by instructions taken from the Aural Transmission.434 Sometimes the Six Dharmas are explained as being \"the path of method\" (thabs lam) and Mahamudra as being \"the path of liberation\" (grollam). In \"the path of method\" the practitioner relies on specific techniques such as visualizations and yogic exercises in order to realize the nature of the mind (sems kyi gnas lugs) while in \"the path of liberation\" the practitioner directly 421 rDo rje tshig 'byed. 428 Lhan cig skyes rna. 429 G: 22. 430 This is a rather unknown Great Seal teaching.

'Jam dbyang mkhyen rtse dbang po composed a text about the Four Letter Mahamudra which is included in Dam ngag mdzod, and listed under 'Jam dbyang mkhyen rtse dbang po 1979 1981 in the Bibliography. Also Lha btsun composed texts about the Four Letter Mahamudrii. Two such texts are available in NGMPP's archives, see Bibliography for details. 431 gTsang smyon Heruka 1971. It is possible that gTsang smyon included this text in the collection because he valued the text. This is also the opinion of Semesi (2007 a: 197). 432 See, for instance, Torricelli 1998, rGod tshang ras pa sNa tshogs rang grol 1974 and !)Tsang smyon Heruka 1971. 3 For more information about these practices, see Chapter 8. It should be noted that the \"entering of corpses\" transference (grong 'jug) is counted as one of the Six Dharmas in the Aural Transmission while bar do is transmitted separately from the Six Dharmas in the Aural Transmission. See, for example, Semesi 2007 a: 175, and especially p. 188; Toricelli 1998: 389,400. 434 For a translation with commentaries of this text, see Guenther 1986. Since this rnam thar was written by Lha btsun, who was a direct disciple of gTsang smyon, we gain much insight into the system of practice of gTsang smyon from the text. 86"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"dwells in that nature without applying such techniques. The Great Seal (Phyag chen, Mahamudrti) and Great Completion (rDzogs chen, Atiyoga) are the most common terms used for the latter category of practices. This division should not be seen as absolute, however, since the two-thabs lam and grol lam-are closely related and interdependent. These different teach-ings are thus best understood as related parts of one system of practice. It should also be held in mind that both the Aural Transmission and the Six Dharmas are intimately connected with the yidam-practices of the higher tantras (anuttarayogatantra); and that they are particularly related with the two main yidams of the bKa' brgyud tradition, Cakrasaqtvara and Vajra-varahi.435 All of these teachings are highly esteemed within the bKa' brgyud tradition and constitute the most characteristic and important parts of the lineage. 436 It should also be remembered that the Six Dharmas, Mahamudra and the Aural Transmissions are considered very profound and secret. They were therefore given to advanced practitioners who had undergone previous train-ing and/or were considered particularly gifted. Nowadays the teachings are mainly given to people who spend longer periods in seclusion for intensive meditation practice, and that was probably also the case when gTsang smyon lived. The first of these instructions that gTsang smyon received was the \"na-ked\" (dmar khrid) \"pointing-out instructions\" (ngo sprod) of the Four Letter Mahamudra. rGod tshang ras pa mentions that these instructions resulted in great progress in his post-meditation practice (rjes thob). The practice of the Four Letter Mahamudra also enabled gTsang smyon to continuously dwell in the so-called state of luminosity ('ad gsa/) at night.m Then, Sha ra ba instructed his young gifted disciple in the Six Dharmas of Naropa. rGod tshang ras pa mentions that Sha ra ba used a particular instruc-tion with notes by Milarepa when he gave these instructions.438 As a result, after having practised for fifteen days, gTsang smyon dreamt of Sha ra ba's consort.439 When gTsang smyon woke up his sexual organ had sunk into his body and did not appear again until eight days later. After this gTsang smyon's male organ mostly remained inside his body, enclosed in a 435 For a study ofYajravariihiNajrayogini, see English 2002. 436 Tantric practice will be descibed in more detail in Chapter 8. 437 G: 22. 438 G: 22: chos drug gi khrid yig rje mi las zin bris. This probably refers to the main Aural Transmission text of the Six Dharmas titled rDzogs rims/eng sgo rnam par gro/ ba 'i chos drug gi khrid yig which is attributed to Milarepa and called zin bris in its colophon (Semesi 2007 a: 158, 190). 439 G: 22; L: 12; T: 40--41. This incident is not mentioned by dNgos grub dpal 'bar but the f~ct that Thu'u bkwan included it in his short synopsis of Heart of the Sun, means that he consid-ered it important. 87"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"sheath.440 gTsang smyon then mastered the practice of gtum mo (\"inner heat\") enabling him to dress only in cotton (ras rkyang).441 He thus joined the noble company of Milarepa (Mi la ras pa), Ras chung pa, Ling ras pa and other famous cotton-clad yogins-ras pas-who could keep their bodies warm dressed only in cotton (ras) in the cold Tibetan climate. rGod tshang ras pa then gives a rather detailed description of how gTsang smyon's yogic practices made the knots of his \"channels\" disappear. The \"subtle energy\" or \"wind\" of the right-and left-hand channels merged into the central channel and his mind unified with the \"wind\" and with the \"drops\".442 This resulted in the appearance of visions (gzigs snang) and signs (rtags snang). As a result of the practice, gTsang smyon also gained the abil-ity to go to different buddha-fields in his dreams, and he became able to perform miracles443 At the time of practising the \"illusory body\" gTsang smyon realized that all appearances are dharmatii and resemble a reflection in a mirror. gTsang smyon then lost all interest in the so-called \"eight worldly concerns\" and henceforth never cared about whether he was praised or blamed, or if he gained or lost. Similarly, he did not care about fame or obscurity, happiness or suffering.444 The complete abandonment of the eight worldly concerns-around which an ordinary person's whole life is usually centered-showed that gTsang smyon was akin to Milarepa and the small number of other figures that are believed to have relinguished them. The Young Monk Seems to be Mad It was around this time that gTsang smyon first appeared to be mad in the eyes of other people.44l The cause of this was gTsang smyon's many late arrivals to his lama's lessons. When asked about his whereabouts gTsang smyon said that he had been to various pure lands, such as U rgyan, or that he had attended ritual feasts (ga~Jacakra) in charnel grounds. Some of Sha ra ba's disciples held him to be a fraud, while others thought he had gone mad when they heard his answers.446 The reason for his unusual behavior was not ordinary madness, however, but was rather a sign of his mastery of the yogic practices and of his disinterest in worldly affairs. 440 This is one of the thirty-two major marks of a Great Man (Mahiipuru~a). These marks are the physical signs of the perfection of a buddha. For an enumeration of all the thirty-two marks, see, for instance, Strong 2001:41--43 or Mahiivas/u Avdiina, vall 1970: 177 f. (San-skrit), The Mahiivas/u 1973: 180-182 (English). 441 G: 22. 442 For more information about these practices, see Chapter 8. 443 G: 23. 444 G: 23. 44l This has also been emphasized by Steams [Kalnins]l985: 23. 446 G: 24. 88"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Then, when [Sha ra ba] gave the naked oral instructions of Naropa's secret conduct, [gTsang smyon] listened to the teachings during the days, and at night he roved around whatever rugged places that existed and practised the secret conduct. Most of the non-humans offered their life-heart (srog snying) and were bound by sacred promises [to gTsang smyon]. In particular, by per-forming gcod beneath a solitary tree great progress came about. Also during the day he solely performed the equalization of taste (ro snyoms) and tram-pled (thog rdzis) on all good and bad circumstances.447 Despite the seemingly strange behavior that gTsang smyon started to display at this time, the full-fledged mad yogin (rna/ 'byor smyon pa) had not yet been born. In fact, his eccentric ways were only a mild premonition of the much more extreme behavior to come, and the sobriquet \"madman\" (smyon pa) or \"Madman of gTsang\" (gTsang pa smyon pa) had not yet been given him. Instead, as seen above, Sha ra ba called him \"Fame of Dharma\" (Chos kyi grags pa) and we must remember that he still was a young monk with much more to learn before fully embarking on the path of a wandering mad yogin. Sha ra ba's Final Instructions The next important step in gTsang smyon's spiritual career was to receive the empowerments of the Aural Transmission. By means of sand mal).cjalas Sha ra ba granted the Four Empowerments of Cakrasarp.vara: with sixty-two deities, thirteen deities, five deities, and of the Innate Father alone. Then, by means of sindilra ma1,1cjalas he performed the empowerment of the consort (yum) Vajravarahi with fifteen deities, seven deities, five deities, and with the Innate Mother alone. Finally, by means of the lama's body, speech and mind, Sha ra ba gave gTsang smyon the profound sign empowerment (zab mo brda 'i dbang).448 Then gTsang smyon received reading transmissions (lung) of many dif-ferent versions of the Cakrasaf11Vara Tantras. In particular, [Sha ra ba] gave [gTsang smyon] the entire and completely per-fect scriptural transmissions and instructions, together with the auxiliary teachings [of the aural transmissions], such as the Aural Transmission of Sa1pvara, the Aural Transmission of Ras chung, the Aural Transmission of Ngan rdzong, and the Aural Transmission of Dags po.

[The teachings that gTsang smyon] received in that way stayed in his heart; it was like taking back one's birthright, and the meaning of all the words entered into his mind.

Sha ra ba answered that he should not, and thereby indicated that gTsang smyon would become his future suc-cessor.450 Then when gTsang smyon had removed his doubts by means of Sha ra ba's instructions, he felt a strong faith in Hayagriva and asked for Sha ra ba's permission to take Hayagriva as his yidam.

According to Tibetan exegetes, dag snang means \"pure appearance\" and should not be understood as some kind of unrealistic and strange way of forcing oneself to see and hear things as something other than what they are, but rather as seeing them as they actually are.

Gradually several other temples and buildings were constructed, and in the year 1427, when Rab brtan kun bzang 'phags pa had reached the age of thirty-eight, the foundation of the famous Auspicious Stupa with Many Doors470 was laid. This stupa-also known as sKu 'bum (Hundred Thousand [mages)-was one of the largest ever built in Tibet, famous for its many chapels and statues.471 The decoration of the stupa continued until around 1440 by which time an encircling wall, several tem-ples and dwelling places for monks had been built. The development of dPal 'khor chos sde did not end in 1440, but continued for several centuries, and by the end ofthe 17th century sixteen colleges had been established.472 When gTsang smyon entered the monastic complex the number of colleges was fewer, but the Sa skya-, dGe lugs-and Zhwa lu-schools were most likely represented with separate colleges. The Gur pa monastic department, which gTsang smyon entered, was primarily a Sa skya monastery, perhaps with a further emphasis on the Bo dong system.473 The building that hosted the de-partment is situated in front of the sKu 'bum Stiipa, and is one of the few buildings of dPal 'khor chos sde that remains intact.474 [n great teaching mo-nasteries such as this one, each subject had its own department, and the Gur pa department probably specialized in the study of Hevajra Tantra. lts name most likely refers to the extraordinary explanatory tantra of the Hevajra cy-cle, Vajra Dome (rDo rje gur).415 Sha ra ba had told gTsang smyon to study 467 Gyurme Dorje 2004: 267-268. 468 Nyang stod is known as Gyantse County nowadays (Gyurme Dmje 2004: 269). 469 Ricca, Franco and Erberto LoBue 1993: 14. 470 bKra shis sgo mang Stlipa. 471 For a detailed description of the stiipa, see Tucci 1989 a, b, c; Ricca, Franco and Erberto LoBue 1993.

Since mKhar kha belonged to the same part of Nyang/Myang as rOyal rtse, and was situated only about fifteen kilometers north of the town, it was probably a natural choice for a monk who wanted to engage in advanced studies.468 The close links between mK.har kha and rOyal rtse are further strengthened by the fact that the first prince of rOyal rtse, dPal !dan bzang po (born 1318), founded both places.469 The main temple (gtsug lha khang) of dPal 'khor chos sde was built by one of dPal ldan bzang po's successors, Rab brtan kun bzang 'phags pa (1389-1442) between 1418 and 1425. Gradually several other temples and buildings were constructed, and in the year 1427, when Rab brtan kun bzang 'phags pa had reached the age of thirty-eight, the foundation of the famous Auspicious Stiipa with Many Doors470 was laid. This stiipa-also known as sKu 'bum (Hundred Thousand [mages}-was one of the largest ever built in Tibet, famous for its many chapels and statues.471 The decoration of the stiipa continued until around 1440 by which time an encircling wall, several tem-ples and dwelling places for monks had been built. The development of dPal 'khor chos sde did not end in 1440, but continued for several centuries, and by the end ofthe 17th century sixteen colleges had been established.472 When gTsang smyon entered the monastic complex the number of colleges was fewer, but the Sa skya-, dGe lugs-and Zhwa lu-schools were most likely represented with separate colleges. The Gur pa monastic department, which gTsang smyon entered, was primarily a Sa skya monastery, perhaps with a further emphasis on the Bo dong system.473 The building that hosted the de-partment is situated in front of the sKu 'bum StOpa, and is one of the few buildings of dPal 'khor chos sde that remains intact.474 [n great teaching mo-nasteries such as this one, each subject had its own department, and the Gur pa department probably specialized in the study of Hevajra Tantra. lts name most likely refers to the extraordinary explanatory tantra of the Hevajra cy-cle, Vajra Dome (rDo 1je gur).415 Sha ra ba had told gTsang smyon to study 467 Gyurme Do~je 2004: 267-268. 468 Nyang stod is known as Gyantse County nowadays (Gyurme Dmje 2004: 269). 469 Ricca, Franco and Erberto LoBue 1993: 14. 470 bKra shis sgo mang Stlipa. 471 For a detailed description of the stiipa, see Tucci 1989 a, b, c; Ricca, Franco and Erberto LoBue 1993.

Then, early in life, he became a monk and devoted his time and energy to study and reci-tation. As a monk, he was extremely careful to keep his monastic precepts, and he amazed people with his memorization abilities and recitation skills. Later he met his root lama and entered the tantric path, received empower-ments and profound esoteric instructions. After the period with his lama, he studied for several years in a monastery and eventually acquired all the nec-essary skills of a vajra master. These themes, with some minor variations, are portrayed in rnam thars about many Buddhist masters in a very similar way. gTsang smyon's extraordinariness during the early part of his life is thus shared with many extraordinary individuals within the Buddhist tradi-tion. After the period of studies in the monastic complex of rOyal rtse gTsang smyon started to behave in a way that set him apart from most great Bud-dhist masters of a more \"normative\" kind. Instead of becoming a fully or-dained bhik~u, he began to model his life-style and way of practice on the tantric siddhas of India. Unlike many other Tibetan masters, he emulated the siddhas in a quite literal way. This radical and rather unusual move away from the monastery upset some of his contemporaries while impressing and inspiring devotion in others. This chapter will describe how gTsang smyon's life changed and how the exemplary monk became a wandering yogin with no fixed abode and quite bizarre and shocking behavior at times. Leaving the Monastery under Dramatic Circumstances The radical change in gTsang smyon's behavior and outer appearance started after a vision in which he encountered the eight goddesses of his yi dam, He-vajra. The vision occurred when gTsang smyon and the other monks of the 97"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Gur pa department were staying at a monastery called rDo t:ie gdan to prac-tise dharma. 492 At dawn, in the middle of rainbow-light, he saw eight very beautiful god-desses, but the central figures: Hevajra, the Father and Mother was miss-ing.493 By his own pride of [being] Hevajra he entered into union494 with each one of the goddesses. He experienced different kinds of bliss with each one of the goddesses and became drunk with an undefiled bliss of body, speech and mind.495 gTsang smyon's many years of Hevajra study and practice had finally yielded its result and no notion of being separate from Hevajra seemed to remain in his mind. Thus, gTsang smyon had reached the conviction, or re-alization as Tibetan exegetes often express it, of actually being Hevajra. dNgos grub dpal 'bar explains how gTsang smyon was transformed after the vision, and how he, from that day onward, never parted from the under-lying sublime essence of all phenomena, the so-called dharmatii.496 Due to this, he became charismatic and fearless. Resembling a lion, he no longer felt any need to prostrate, use polite expressions, or exhibit other forms of re-spectful behavior towards anybody. Convinced that he was Hevajra, gTsang smyon did not even bow down or show respect to powerful people such as kings, queens or ministers; instead he played pranks and made jokes. People who were unaware of the reason for his provocative behavior were upset and shocked.497 Of the three biographers, only rGod tshang ras pa gives a detailed account of what happened when gTsang smyon left his monastery. In the sixth chap-ter of the Hearl of the Sun he describes the following colorful scenario: 492 Tucci mentions two different monasteries near rGyal rtse known by this name: gNas my-ing, fifteen kilometers south ofrGyal rtse, and Mag Ide !ding, on the road between rGyal rtse and gZhi ka rtse (Tucci 1989 a: 56, 67, 144). 493 This means that the main figures Hevajra and his consort, Nairiitmya (bDag med rna), were missing and only the surrounding eight goddesses were there. 494 sNyoms par zhugs pa, this term generally means \"To have sexual union\" but it has a dee-per meaning. The term is used in the unsurpassed yoga tantras (Anu//arayogatantra) to indi-cate that the male and female consorts of a deity are standing together in sexual union. This kind of sexual union represents a perfect harmony of the female, wisdom (prajiiii) and the male, method (upiiya) (Padma Karpo Translation Committee 2003). 495 N: 7b: de dag gi gnas skabs gcig na I rdo rje gdan bya bar chos bar mdzad cing bzhugs pa las I tho rangs ci g 'ja' 'ad kyi dbus na I dges pa rdo rje yab yum gtso bo mi bzhugs pa 'i I lha mo brgyad shin tu yid du 'ong ba gzigs te I rang nyid dges pa rdo rje 'i nga rgyal gyis I lha mo so soIa snyoms par zhugs pas I lha more re Ia bde ba 'i rnam pa mi 'dra ba Ire re nyams su myong zhing I Ius ngag yid gsum zag med kyi bde bas ra ro ba byung gsung /.

He ate the tea, soup, and so on, in his skull-cup. Adding /sam pa and biscuits, he stirred the mixture with his thighbone trumpet and ate. The master of discipline noticed that the monks around him had started to laugh. He asked, \"What kind of behavior of monks in the assembly is this?\" and prepared to beat [gTsang smyon] with a stick. \"Oh, set aside beating me and listen! In which siitra or tantra is it ex-plained that one is not allowed to carry a skull-cup and thigh-bone trumpet into the assembly of monks?

The vision at rDo rje gdan seems to have been the spark that ignited the fire of the sponta-neous, unusual and bizarre conduct that was to become his trademark. This fire had just started to bum, and would. bum stronger and stronger in the years that followed. Its nature will be exemplified in detail in this and the next chapter. gTsang smyon was now gaining confidence in being Hevajra and since Hevajra is a so-called heruka this was a kind of preliminary \"birth of the heruka\", in a sense. It was not the final birth of the heruka, however, as the most important transformative vision was yet to come. To remain within the confines of a monastery and adhere to the many rules of a monk was no longer a support on the path towards accomplish-ment and ultimately enlightenment, but rather something that made progress difficult for the young monk. Having accomplished his sutric and tantric studies, he was now extremely learned, but he was still lacking the inner realization that was needed to reach the final goal---enlightenment. This pattern is often found in Indian siddha hagiographies; in order to reach real understanding even the monastery and monkhood must be given up. The many rules and the lifestyle that previously were a necessary support for practice and accomplishment eventually becomes a hindrance. A distinct example of this is found in the rnam t har of one of the spiritual ancestors of gTsang smyon, Naropa (1012-1100). Naropa is presented as an extremely learned monk who could defeat any scholar in debate, but once when he was studying an extremely ugly woman appeared and asked him if he understood the sense of what he was studying. Naropa answered that he did and the ugly woman started to cry. When Naropa asked her about the reason for her sad-ness, she answered that she became sad because a great scholar such as he lied, and falsely asserted that he understood the sense which he did not.503 Naropa realized that the ugly woman was right and asked her who, then, understands the sense. The woman told him that her brother, Tilopa, did and then disappeared like a rainbow in the sky. This incident encouraged Naropa to search for Tilopa, so that he could learn the sense of the words from him. Naropa gave up his belongings and books, left the monastery, and started to search for his guru. When he eventually found Tilopa, he was forced to ab-andon all his preconceptions about right and wrong, purity and impurity, and 502 G: 28-29. For the Tibetan text, see Appendix I. Most of this section is also translated in Steams [Kalnins] ( 1985: 26-27). I have followed her translation closely. 503 Guenther 1986: 24-25. 100"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"so on. After twelve years of practice under Tilopa's guidance Naropa reached the goal and become a perfected one, a siddha, just like his guru. The path towards this exalted state included extreme acts of self-denial, such as: stealing, assaulting a queen and dragging her around, entering into a sex-ual relationship with a girl, and eventually giving the girl to his guru as a gift.504 Acts such as these were not only at odds with the monastic discipline, but also at odds with the norms of society at large. The extreme and some-times even criminal character of such acts were not pointless however, in fact they were acts of a higher and more advanced discipline according to the Tibetan and Indian exegetes of Tantric Buddhism. At a certain point, every-thing must be given up in order to reach final salvation. Another example of this kind of sudden change of conduct and its relation to spiritual insight is found in a rnam thar of Ma gcig lab sgron (1055-1153). When Ma gcig attained realization, she stopped wearing nice clothes and started to dress in rags. She began to keep company with beggars and lepers, rather than with monks and teachers, as previously. She also slept anywhere, on the side of a road or in the house of a leper and wandered all around the country without aim. She ate just about anything, and did not care whether she was slandered or praised. In short, she had given up worldly attachments and remained utterly fearless in the equanimity of the dhar-mata505 gTsang smyon, like Naropa and Ma gcig lab sgron before him, realized that the time was ripe to continue on his spiritual path until he thoroughly understood the sense of what he had studied-and the life of a monk in a monastery was not conducive to this understanding. He thus paid heed to the next' series of commands that Sha ra ba had given him before they parted: \"Wear rags for clothes. Give up these three: food, clothes, and fame. Be a child of the mountains; wear the mists as your clothes. Through disciplined conduct, carry the objects of perception onto the path. Trample on that which is dreaded!\"506 At this point, gTsang smyon had \"dispelled all his misconceptions regard-ing listening (thos) and reflecting (bsam)\" and the time for practice hadar-rived.507 Before leaving he read about the Ever Weeping Bodhisattva, Sadaprarudita, and was so moved that he began to shed tears. Filled with unbiased compassion towards all sentient beings, he then left the monas-tery.50R After leaving his monastery, gTsang smyon never again dressed or behaved like a monk and he seldom visited or lived in monasteries. Instead, he kept his hair long, dressed like a tantric yogin, and wandered around from place to place. The only time he settled down for longer periods was· when 504 The twelve acts of self-denial are translated in Guenther 1986: 43-86. 505 Edou 1996: 133. 506 G 25-26.

Then, on the evening of the l51h day of the month (the full-moon day), accompanied by his younger brother, dKon mchog rgyal mtshan, he left. The year was probably 1472 when the two young brothers left mKhar kha, and gTsang smyon was twenty-one. 510 The follow-ing morning they arrived at a mountain pass just when the sun rose at its peak. The beautiful sight was interpreted as an auspicious omen (rten 'brei) and gTsang smyon told his brother that they should perform a gar;~acakra. While they were performing the tantric feast, five women appeared with beer for the ritual. According to the rnam thars, the ladies were c;lakinis welcom-ing the two brothers to Tsari.511 Continuing to travel towards Tsari they soon arrived at the ferry place of Sha ra and there they met the governor (nang so) of Hor shag with his reti-nue. gTsang smyon had now changed his way of interacting with other peo-ple and seemed especially keen on insulting people of high status, such as kings and leaders, which we will see many examples of in the rnam thars. When the governor asked gTsang smyon where he was going gTsang smyon answered: \"I came from behind and I am heading forwards.\"512 The governor remarked that gTsang smyon had a harsh mouth and received yet another abusive reply from the young yogin: \"There is nothing [I] can do about it, having anointed much oil on the mouth it is still hard. 513 But if you need this soft and cold glacier water I can give it to you.\"514 Despite, or perhaps be-cause of, gTsang smyon's provocative ways the governor became convinced that gTsang smyon was a genuine and good yogin. He even requested gTsang smyon to stay as his officiating priest (mchod gnas). gTsang smyon answered that he could not be the officiating priest of just one person but 509 Later in life he was sometimes invited to stay with leaders who had become his benefac-tors, but he always kept his wandering life-style and preferred remote retreat places._ . 51° As will be seen, Lha btsun states that he was twenty-one when he reached Tsan (L: 18) and this corresponds well with rOod tshang ras pa's and dNgos grub dpal 'bar's rnam thars. Although the latter two rnam thars do not give any dates or ages, the chronolo~y and years spent in the monastery correspond with his age when leaving m.Khar kha: and It thus seem that the chronological discrepancies between the three rnam thars hav~ d1sappeared. As al-ready stated in a previous footnote, Tibetans count the age of persons differently t~an we do in the West: everyone is one year old at birth, and 21 therefore means 20 accordmg to the Western way of counting.

First, they went towards Lhasa by way of Rong chung, and the next day they arrived at the New Fort (rDzong gsar) of sNe pa mdo. At this place, gTsang smyon not only behaved provocatively and insultingly, but also in an outright mad and shocking manner.516 Lha btsun and dNgos grub dpal 'bar state that gTsang smyon \"acted out the conduct\" (spyod mdzad) in the mar-ket place and that people became so upset that they tried to kill him with stones and knives.517 Only rGod tshang ras pa describes what happened in the market place of the New Fort of sNe pa mdo and therefore it is to the Heart of the Sun we now turn. rGod tshang ras pa describes how a ransom offering (mdos) was being performed in the place when gTsang smyon arrived. Sol-diers participated in the ceremony and many people had gathered. Tucci explains that the mdos-ritual \"consists of offering gifts which are particularly valued by the hostile powers, so that, contented (mnyes) and satiated (tshims), they will calm themselves (zhi ba) and abstain from further perse-cution.\"518 The offerings that are made in the ritual are arranged in specific ways as a kind of ransom and the \"hostile powers\", or demons if you will, are trapped in a so-called \"thread cross\".519 It is plausible that a ritual such as this, which is directed towards demons and hostile powers, could be consid-ered dangerous. It is also reasonable to imagine that the people who had assembled believed that negative forces and demons were literally present during the performance of the ransom offering. gTsang smyon went into the crowd and overturned and broke the huge ransom offering (mdos). Then he started to eat the cakes (gtor ma) that had stood on the shrine he just had destroyed. He not only ate the offering cakes, but also threw them around and the many assembled people and soldiers became upset and probably frightened as well.20 gTsang smyon was likely regarded as a demon coming to consume the offerings, or perhaps as a mad-man who did not understand the importance of the ritual. The crowd did not accept such behavior and began attacking him. They tried various means to kill him, but despite throwing stones at him, stabbing him with swords and lances, hitting him with sticks, and shooting at him with arrows, he remained unharmed. The reason for this was that he had entered into a meditative trance called \"very firm vajra\"521 that made him invulnerable.522 SIS L: 18. 516 G 30 (in this rnam thar the name oft he place is spelled: sNel pa 'dos), L: 18; N: 8b. m L: 18; N: 8b. 518 Tucci 1980: 176. 519 See Tucci 1980: 174, figure 15 a, for an illustration.

He thus revealed his actual identity, a compassionate bodhisattva disguised as a madman. The furious people were not convinced of this, however, but concluded, \"This certainly was the mira-cle of an elemental spirit or ghoul.\"523 Eventually: ... the soldiers drove [gTsang smyon] in front of them towards the sKyid chu river, the women wailed and the monks performed the final parts of the ran-som offering. At that time, in front of everyone, [gTsang smyon] did not sink down into the water of the river but became a great whirlwind and landed on the oppo-site side of the river. Everyone, seeing they could do nothing, became amazed and perplexed.524 The incident above was the first, but definitely not the last, of its kind; the rnam thars contain many similar stories. Time after time gTsang smyon's behavior was so provocative to people around him that they tried to kill him. He was often held to be a demon and people were often afraid of him.525 Only gTsang smyon's miraculous powers saved him, and it seems that he sometimes deliberately acted in a provocative and mad way just to be able to demonstrate his extraordinary powers. This made him famous, and some people started to believe that he was a true yogin who should be venerated rather than despised. gTsang smyon gained many of his supporters and bene-factors as a result of this kind of outrageous conduct, and rOod tshang ras pa informs us that the incident depicted above had exactly such a result. When reports of his activities at the ransom offering reached the ears of the land-lord dOe gnyan chos skyabs, he invited gTsang smyon for tea and beer. The landlord was impressed by the young yogin and faith arose in him. dOe gnyan chos skyabs was later rewarded with wealth as a result of having of-fered drinks and showed devotion towards the unusual yogin.526 The latter theme is also commonplace in the rnam thars, the result of respecting and displaying devotion to gTsang smyon, despite his provocations, is fortune and wealth, while the result of not respecting him and lacking faith in him could be disastrous. The mechanism behind this is usually understood by Buddhist exegetes to be cause and effect.

'khor chos sde, in the year 1470, arose in gTsang smyon's mind. Longing for the incomparable precious one, Sha ra ba, he shed tears [and] performed many full-length prostrations and circumambulations at [Sha ra ba's former] dwelling place, at the place where he passed away, and at the shrine where he had been cremated. Then [gTsang smyon] listened to all the dharma teachings that A 'o chos Ije mNyam nyid rdo Ije ba had received from the incomparable precious one [Sha ra ba], such as tantras and instruc-tions that dispel doubts, and he once again listened to the ritual practice of U rgyan530 and the permission blessing (rjes gnang) and methods for accom-plishment of the Black Field Protector with a Lion Face.531 Not being able to meet Sha ra ba in person, gTsang smyon met the famous physician A 'o chos rje mNyam nyid rdo rje, whom gTsang smyon had met on his first trip to Tsari. As mentioned, it was thanks to A 'o chos rj e that gTsang smyon met Sha ra ba.

The story loses much of its significance otherwise. bKra shis dar rgyas was the myriarch of Bya, or Bya yul, a large area south of the Dwags po and Yar lung regions of Southern Tibet.537 Tsari be-longed to the Bya myriarchy the capital of of which was Chos rgyallhun po, which gTsang smyon later visited. According to Cyrus Steams, bKra shis dar rgyas was one of the most generous religious patrons of the fifteenth century.538 This is confirmed by the Tibetan historian bSod nams grags pa, who mentions that bKra shis dar rgyas of Bya carried out many meritorious works. bSod nams grags pa describes how he ordered a golden image of Buddha Sakyamuni to be made, a temple to be built, a copy of bKa' 'gyur to be written in golden letters, and a large stilpa to be built.539 \"Nevertheless, he was very partial as regards religion and his fame was therefore restricted to a part only,\" bSod nams grags pa continues.540 The Venerable Lady Kun dga' bzang mo, was born in Kong po in 1459 and she was recognized as the reincarnation of the female master Chos kyi sgron rna (1422-1455).541 Like her predecessor, Kun dga' bzang mo was considered to be an embodiment of the Indian tantric deity Vajravarahi.542 Kun dga' bzang mo was thirteen (fourteen according to Tibetan calculation) when the meeting occurred, and given the way gTsang smyon talked to her, this might appear a bit odd.

When Chos kyi sgron rna died, he took care of her reincarnation, Kun dga' bzang mo, and they often trav-eled together.544 rGod tshang ras pa describes their meeting as follows: In gNas nang, [gTsang smyon's) brother was sent off ahead with their be-longings and a yak. The Lord came after, wearing a lotus hat ofUrgyan with feathers and silk on his head, a cloak on his body, and holding his weapon-the kha!vlinga-in his hand.

Governor bKra shis dar rgyas and his entou-rage, the patron and priests ofBya, are coming here to see them off,\" they an-swered. At that, the Lord lay down across the very path on which they were about to come, and remained there with a yogic gaze. When they came, he did noth-ing whatsoever, and they had to tum to the side of the path. Some of them said, \"He may have fainted or perhaps he is a fraud.\" After a little while [gTsang smyon] rose up and started to walk. There were watchdogs tied up facing one another at the door, but he just went di-rectly inside without caring about them. There he encountered the Venerable Kun dga' bzang mo, dPal 'chimed grub pa and Bya pa bKra shis dar rgyas surrounded by a large entourage, seated in rows and eating. The Lord entered the rows and went in tum to each person saying, \"Pour me an offering of food!\" The Bya pa poured him all he had and the Lord humbly said, \"An excellent connection.\" The Venerable Lady had a boiled heart on her table, and suddenly [gTsang smyon] took it, and ate it. The Venerable Lady said, \"the young monk seems hungry.\" \"Not only am I hungry, but I also want to fuck you,\" [gTsang smyon] replied. 'Chi med pa asked, \"What kind of qualities do you possess to act in this manner?\" \"I know the glorious Hevajra,\" [gTsang smyon] answered. The Venerable Lady said, \"Well then, it is said 'Do not be attached to pleasant or unpleasant discursive thoughts', what does this mean?'' The Lord said, \"It is saying that one should neither have attachment to-ward a beautifhl woman like you, nor feel disgust towards one who is lep-rous.\" 'Chi med pa blinked to the Venerable Lady and said, \"To carry out that kind of conduct one must know the 'Chapter of Conduct', so bring it forth!\" The Lord replied, \"Poor young monk!\" and gave a perfect explanation of the general outline of the Chapter of Conduct, backing it up with sections \"'' This is exemplified by the fact that Kun dga' bzang mo averted a Mongol invasion anc.l r,~rli1rmcd many other demanding tasks early in life (Diembergcr 2007: 24 7). · D1emberger 2007: 79-80. 107"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"from other tantras.

Inwardly, he has the glory of experience and realization, and the dis-ciplined conduct (brtul zhugs) of a yogin. At present, by his conduct of stamping on fear (nyams nga thog rdzis kyi spyod pa), he brings evidently good and bad circumstances onto the path. I rejoice at the existence of a yo-gin that is in harmony with the outer and inner signs, like a daytime star in this degenerate time.\" After saying [this he] folded his hands, closed his eyes and bowed with his head. The By a pa governor said, \"It seems that he is a good yogin in agreement with the meaning.\" dPal 'chimed grub pa said, \"I have seen many a yogin, but apart from him [gTsang smyon] I have not seen a yogin that is in agreement with [both] inner and outer signs [before].\" Those who had assembled there [developed] great confidence, and praised the good qualities of the Lord, the great mighty yogin. They energetically proclaimed his greatness in all directions and especially the Bya pa myriarch became very devoted and said, \"If you stay in rTsa ri (Tsari) I will provide practice-provision.\" \"Food is a very kind (thing to give), [so] give me that,\" [gTsang smyon answered). [gTsang smyon] promised to visit Chos rgyal !hun po545 in the au-tumn.546 The episode cited above is typical in many ways; gTsang smyon's bizarre way of dressing and his provocative way of acting and speaking appear clearly in it. Similar stories are told repeatedly in the rnam thars. gTsang smyon often walked directly up to important persons and took their food or drink. This he did despite the guards and followers of the king or leader, who often became paralyzed by his charisma and spiritual powers and were ther':!-fore unable to stop him. The reaction that his provocations evoked differed; sometimes people tried to kill him, and at other times he was respected. Re-gardless of what kind of reaction his unusual ways gave rise to, it probably made him remembered and talked about. The many provocations and bizarre stories that filled his life, especially the ten-year period after he left dPal 'khor chos sde, constitute an important part of gTsang smyon's career. It was through acting in strange and provocative ways that he laid the foundation for future success it seems. The support from the myriarch of Bya, bKra shis dar rgyas, made his fur-ther activities in the Tsari area easier. When gTsang smyon and his brother came to the monastery bDe chen gling in Bya in the summer, the master in 545 Chos rgyal !hun po was the residence of the Bya family in Dol (van der Kuijp 2006: 22) and as already mentioned it was the capital of the Bya myriarchy. 546 G: 32-33.

Having ascertained that gTsang smyon was an accomplished yogin, devotion arose in the mind of the master. One day the Dharma Lord Chos rgyal dpal bzangs said: \"Since you are a yogin who has obtained perfection and I have planned to build a protector chapel here, you need to pacify the ground and set the aus-picious connection and so on.\" The Lord answered, \"Since this would benefit the teachings and the living beings of course I will do it.\" Then the Lord went to a slaughtering place. He filled intestines with blood and [with these he] made ornaments for his hands and feet. He held some fresh hearts and lungs in his hands and smeared all of his body with blood. Then, performing the monastic dance of the \"walking vajra\" he went [to the place that was to be inaugurated]. In a completely perfect (manner] he per-formed the Vajrakilaya-monastic dances of pacifying the ground and later he concealed the hearts, lungs, and so on, in the earth at the center of the [place where the] protector chapel (was to be constructed]. Then he commanded the Dharma Protectors, \"In the future this place should be controlled by the pow-er of the Guardians.\"s49 This story illustrates how gTsang smyon perfonned rituals in a quite literal way that must have amazed and shocked people who saw him; what others visualized while reciting the liturgy, gTsang smyon sometimes acted out. He thereby \"became\" the wrathful deity that he invoked in the ritual, and he dressed, danced and behaved as such. The next stage of their trip towards Tsari was undertaken in the autumn, and once again gTsang smyon received an opportunity \"to enter into the action\" (spyod pa Ia gshegs pa) and display eccentric behavior. This time gTsang smyon and his brother traveled together with his supporter and bene-factor, the Myriarch of Bya, bKra shis dar rgyas. \"Patron and priest\" (yon mchod) thus joined company for a while, but gTsang smyon soon decided that the myriarch and his retinue should go on ahead. Without the company of his powerful companions, gTsang smyon arrived at a mountain pass where a crowd of people had gathered. He went right into the crowd and started to jump around among the people.

They tied his hands and feet on his back and threw him into a terri tying crev-ice of a glacier. That night he stayed [in the crevice] and because [gTsang smyon] per-formed gturn rna-meditation, the glacier for about one fathom around his body melted. The following morning he walked on. 550 gTsang smyon thus demonstrated his supernatural powers and his mastery of the yoga of inner heat (gtum mo). After this incident gTsang smyon arrived at the Wisdom Wheel of Tsari where the vajra master Su ru kha mtha' and Jo bzangs, together with male and females disciples (nya rna) and mountain people (ri pa) had gathered.551 gTsang smyon entered the crowd ... . . . altematingly eating from a sugar-cane that he held in his right hand and fe-ces that he held in his left, he threw urine on everyone, beat some people, and so on. Despite all the unsuitable actions he performed, everyone was subdued by the splendour of his appearance and became devoted. Then they gave [gTsang smyon] the name \"Hero ofrTsa ri\" (Tsari) and he became famous.552 It is interesting and perhaps surprising that rGod tshang ras pa states that the very bizarre and provocative behavior of his teacher did not make people angry on this particular occasion. How can holding feces and throwing urine on people make them devoted? The reason for this might be that the readers (or listeners) of the rnam thar were supposed to know that an accomplished yogin could, and at a certain stage in his spiritual career perhaps should, behave in unusual and outrageous ways. If they did not know it, the rnam thars about gTsang smyon provide them with this lesson. gTsang smyon's extreme behavior is therefore not a fault, but rather serves as a proof of gTsang smyon's extraordinary qualities. The courage and freedom from constraints that this kind of behavior requires was regarded as signs of his accomplishment rather than of his shortcomings.553 Meditation Practice In the remote solitary place called Tiger's Den, for the sake of exhorting [your] disciples to practise vigorously, 550 G: 34.

I bow down to you-King of the steadfast sages.554 Having described gTsang smyon's outrageous behavior, the rnam thars shift focus for a while and explain how gTsang smyon practised meditation with great diligence. The biographers point out in particular how he endured great hardships while practising. The emphasis on meditation practice, diligence, and the ability to endure hardships, are generally important components in Buddhist hagiographies. The message that is being conveyed in the life sto-ries is that realization can not be attained without diligence and hardships, and also that the sense of the words and theories will never be understood without practising what has been studied. Practice in this context usually refers to meditation, the third part of the triad: listening (thos), reflecting (bsam) and meditating (sgom), although it also can refer to the actions per-formed between meditation periods. gTsang smyon had already perfected the listening and reflecting part of the path, but the meditation and practice part of the path towards enlightenment needed to be accomplished as well. In the three rnam thars, a similar description of how gTsang smyon prac-tised meditation is given. Despite the similarities, there are differences how-ever, dNgos grub dpal 'bar gives a very brief account while rGod tshang ras pa and Lha btsun give a more detailed description.555 Both rGod tshang ras pa and Lha btsun agree that gTsang smyon stayed for three years in Tsari meditating but they give different names to the place where he stayed. Lha btsun mentions that he stayed at sTag tshang (Tiger's Den) and rGod tshang ras pa that he stayed at gTsang pa spang chung.556 All three authors mention that he practised very intensively, day and night, for six months. However, it seems a bit unclear if gTsang smyon practised in isolation during the whole three-year period, or if he sometimes left his meditation place. dNgos grub dpal 'bar only mentions the six month period, and according to him gTsang smyon mainly practised the Secret Conduct of Naropa (Naro gsang spyod) during the six months.557 This does not necessarily contradict rGod tshang ras pa's and Lha btsun's accounts, however, since they also describe a six-554 L: 19: stag tshang zhes bya bgrod dka 'i dben gnas suI gdul bya sgrub Ia brtson par bskul ba'i phyir I mnyam gzhag ling 'dzin ngang Ia rise gcig tu I g.yo med drang srong rgyal po k\"fod I a 'dud I. 55 N: 9a-9b; G: 35-36; L: 19-23.

During the three years in Tsari, gTsang smyon seem to have had at least two companions who assisted him, at least to begin with. rGod tshang ras pa mentions that gTsang smyon's brother, mKon mchog rgyal mtshan, and a yogin called \"the bearded one of gTsang\" (gTsang pa rgya'o) were with him.559 The three-year retreat of gTsang smyon seems to have been quite different from the formal, structured and organized three-year retreats that are performed these days.560 Just like his prototype, Milarepa, he stayed in a remote area in the wilderness, and the way he practised seems to have been governed by his own intuition and the visions he encountered, rather than by rules or spiritual guidance from a retreat master. Since the information provided in the rnam thars about gTsang smyon's three-year retreat is rather scarce and somewhat heterogeneous, we have to make certain assumptions. As mentioned above he probably stayed in Tsari for three years, perhaps at the same place, or at least in the same area. Dur-ing this period, he spent about six months practising day and night without leaving his meditation cave. In what follows I will first summarize some parts of the account of gTsang smyon's meditation retreat in Tsari as de-picted by Lha btsun, and then in conclusion cite rGod tshang ras pa 's ac-count at length. Lha btsun begins his account with a description of gTsang smyon's thoughts before beginning his retreat. He describes how gTsang smyon re-called the example of the historical Buddha, Naropa, and Milarepa, and re-flected upon the way in which his lineage-the practice lineage-had been transmitted previously.561 Emphasizing the extraordinary efforts and hard-ships the early lineage holders had endured, gTsang smyon first thought about how the historical Buddha, prior to his enlightenment, had spent six years of asceticism on the bank of a river.562 Then the Indian Siddha Naropa came to his mind. Despite having mastered the five branches of knowledge before meeting Tilopa, Naropa followed his lama and suffered many hard-ships for a period of twelve years.563 Finally, gTsang smyon thought about ssM The impression when reading dNgos grub dpal 'bar's text is that he stayed for six months during the winter, and then in the spring he still practised in Tsari but left his retreat cave to engage in action (spyodpa) again (N: 9a-9b). 559 G: 35. 56° For a description of the many practices that are traditionally carried out during a three-year retreat, see Kongtrul's Retreat Manual.

Lha btsun also describes how snow fell for twelve days and blocked the entrance to his meditation cave. The snow forced gTsang smyon to remain inside his cave for seven months.567 During this period, he sustained himself on water and had only some leaves to sit on. Eventually even the leaves were worn out, and he had to continue his meditation practice sitting directly on a slab of stone on the floor of his cave. When his practice started to bear fruit, the lower part of his body was full of wounds and he was on the edge of starva-tion. Lha btsun describes how his intense meditation practice led to a mas-tery of the inner yogic practices. Having gained control over the subtle chan-nels (rtsa) and the subtle energies (rlung) and the drops (thig le) everything started to shine forth as co-emergent wisdom of great bliss.568 Although his physical condition was very bad, he managed to remain inwardly undis-turbed in his meditative concentration.569 During his strict meditation retreat, gTsang smyon had several dreams and visions that had a profound impact on him and guided him through the hardships he faced.570 After five months of intensive practice, gTsang smyon Committee these five are: 1) nang gi rig pa \"science of inner (development)\"; 2) gtan tshigs kyi rig pa \"science oflogic\"; 3) sgra'i rig pa \"knowledge/science of sotmds (comprised of the knowledge of unarticulated and articulated sounds, the latter of which is the science of gram-mar)\"; 4) gso ba'i rig pa \"science of healing\"; 5) bzo gnas kyi rigpa, \"science of fabrication\" ~The Padma Karpo Translation Committee 2003). 64 L: 19-20: nga rang yang dka' bead brtson 'grus drag pos tshe 'dir mchog gi dngos grub /hob par byed dgos dgongs I. 565 G: 36.

He went out and started to search for the extraordinary substance that the l;liikinis had talked about. After a while he saw a crow encircling something nearby and hurried to the spot below. There he found the corpse of a seven-teen-year-old leper girl. He broke open the skull of the corpse and ate some brains.577 He also mentally offered some of it to his own lama, Sha ra ba, and to other bKa' brgyud lamas, some he offered to Yajraviiriihi and other yi-dams, and some to Sirphavakrii (Seng gdong) and other protectors.

He sat in meditation posture, the inner winds (rlung) melted into the central channel, and he experienced emptiness and clarity. In his meditation, he saw how the beings in hell suffer from heat and cold, how the hungry ghosts suffer from hunger and thirst, and how the animals suffer from mental blindness and from eating one another.579 A limitless compas-sion arose and he prayed to his lama, the Dharma Lord Sha ra ba, whom he visualized as sitting on top of his head. Light radiated from Sha ra ba's body and purified the different kinds of suffering that the beings of the three lower realms experience and they became settled in the happiness of gods and hu-mans. The humans and gods in tum became liberated from suffering as well, and reached a state of meditative absorption. For seven days gTsang smyon remained in the \"meditative absorption that dries up the ocean of samsaric suffering. \"580 As already mentioned, rGod tshang ras pa describes the periods of prac-tice a bit differently. To conclude the section of gTsang smyon 's meditation practice I will therefore cite rGod tshang ras pa's account at length.

This vision eventually became known as his \"secret life story\" (gsang ba 'i rnam thar). According to dNgos grub dpal 'bar and rGod tshang ras pa, gTsang smyon did not tell anyone about this vision until the very end of his life. dNgos grub dpal 'bar describes how gTsang smyon decided to reveal the profound vision to his close disciples on the 13th day of the fifth Hor month 1507, two days before he passed away.588 Lha btsun depicts the important vision and quotes the so-called secret life story in which the vision is described in the section that describes gTsang smyon's first stay in Tsari.589 According to Lha btsun, the vision thus oc-curred immediately after parting with Sha ra ba, before gTsang smyon stud-ied in dPal 'khor chos sde. Lha btsun instead describes two other visionary encounters of importance that gTsang smyon had during his second stay in Tsari, and since they are somewhat similar, at least in function, they will be mentioned briefly before continuing with the secret life story. gTsang smyon had the first vision in a remote place in Tsari that was full of wild and dangerous animals.59° Cakrasarp.vara appeared and gTsang smyon received the four empowerments directly from him and he was given the secret name bZhad pa rdo rje.591 On a later occasion, gTsang smyon went to the Turquoise Lake592 in Tsari where he encountered Vajravarah1 who urged him to compose The Outline of the Adamantine Verses that Dispels the Darkness of lgnorance.593 Encouraged by the vision he thus composed his first text at this point, according to Lha btsun.594 Neither rGod tshang ras pa nor dNgos grub dpal 'bar mention these vi-sions, but they both mention that the vision that was to become known as gTsang smyon' s secret life story occurred at the end of his second stay in Tsari. I will follow the chronology suggested by them and present it here. rGod tshang ras pa devotes the seventh chapter of the Hearl of the Sun to this vision and its aftermath, and he summarizes the content of the chapter as follows: \"How [gTsang smyon] was assisted by the yi dam and perfected his experience and realization.\"595 At the beginning of the chapter he describes the vision in the following way: 588 N: 25b. 589L: 14-15. 590 The place is called Dom tshang gnas (The Bear Nest Place) L: 27. 591 L: 28.

It had the architecture of the supreme god, the king Hevajra, and it was filled with sons and daughters of the gods. They spoke with clear voices and understood the meaning. I decided to request empowerments from the king (Hevajra). I went down on my knees, with folded hands, and supplicated him. The king (Hevajra) bestowed general and special samayas and vows to me.

First of all, the three rnam thars quote it verbatim. Secondly, it is gTsang smyon's secret life story (gsang ba 'i rnam thar) and as such believed to contain his most significant dreams and visions.599 The vision of Hevajra was in fact a final affirmation of gTsang smyon's success in Hevajra practice. As seen above, Sha ra ba had told gTsang smyon that he should take Hevajra as his mainyidam, and after parting from his root lama, also according to his lama's command, he studied the Hevajra Tantra in dPal 'khor chos sde. It has also been mentioned that it was a vi-sionary encounter with the eight female divinities, or consorts, of Hevajra that led gTsang smyon to start the unconventional behavior that led to his departure from the monastery. It is also often described that gTsang smyon impressed people with his expertise in the Hevajra Tantra, and we have seen how gTsang smyon referred to its chapter of conduct when dPal 'chi med grub pa questioned him about his provocative behavior.600 Then, after having spent three years meditating on Hevajra in Tsari he had obviously removed the last remaining traces of seperation from his yidam, and from then on he \"became\" Hevajra in human form. This realization was confirmed by He-vajra himself who granted the four tantric empowerments in their entirety to gTsang smyon and gave him the secret name Khrag 'thung rgyal po.601 The name Khrag 'thung rgyal po actually means \"King of the Blood Drinkers\", and \"Blood Drinker\" (khrag 'thung) is a Tibetan equivalent of Sanskrit he-ruka. Heruka is the general name given to semi-wrathful and wrathful male yidams of the higher tantras, and the vision of Hevajra/Heruka may be seen as the actual \"birth of the heruka\". 602 gTsang smyon had perfected his studies and meditation ~md became a perfected one-a siddha (grub thob).

The day after he received the empowerment from Hevajra, gTsang smyon's brother was shown the corpse of a woman who had died of small-pox on the bank of a river south of the By a 'phur sgang (Flying Bird Hill).603 dKon mchog rgyal mtshan (gTsang smyon's brother) told gTsang smyon about the corpse and gTsang smyon left his strict retreat. Instead of shunning the potentially contagious and therefore dangerous body, gTsang smyon's brother removed the upper part of the head of the corpse and offered it to gTsang smyon. gTsang smyon blessed everyone who was present on the occasion with it and ... Most of the people obtained ordinary accomplishments (thun mong gi dngos grub); those who wanted children but previously could not get [children] ob-tained children; those who were sick were liberated from their diseases; those who wanted wealth obtained wealth; those with disabled sense faculties re-gained the sharpness of their senses, and so on.604 This incident was yet another example that shows how gTsang smyon en-gaged in activities that ordinary people dread. What would have been pollut-ing and dangerous for a normal person was transformed into something beneficial and purifying. Instead being infected with small-pox, they re-ceived blessing and good fortune by means of the corpse. gTsang smyon had now reached his goal and rGod tshang ras pa devotes the rest of the chapter to describing his attainment: From that point onwards, all the conceptual structures of ihe rational mind-the understanding and the experience---<Jf the Lord were liberated into their own condition. All that is grasped and the grasping itself dissolved into space; the meditation and the meditator parted from the rational mind; the meaning that is neither bondage nor liberation manifested; samsara and nir-vana mixed into one; and the knowledge of non-action naturally was estab-lished. The dividing line between meditation and post-meditation was thus erased. Knowledge of things as they are, and of all that exists, completely overflowed [gTsang smyon's mind], and the five wisdoms were beyond clari-fication, obscuration and interruption. All the knots of the subtle channels were liberated and purified in the central channel. [ ... ] The stages of the paths arose, and regardless of high and low, all at once, he traversed all the levels and paths, at one [and the same] time. The ten powers, distinctly and without fear, the greatness of the Buddha, the inex-haustible wheel of ornamentation, and so on, all qualities of the Victorious One were perfected without effort. At this time [gTsang smyon] realized the mind of the all-pervasive Lord, Vajradhara, the personification of the five wisdoms and the four bodies. 603 dNgos grub dpal 'bar states that it was in the spring that gTsang smyon was shown the corpse, and he says nothing about the reason for the woman's death (N: 9b). 604 G: 36. for the Tibetan text, see Appendix I.

During this period gTsang smyon practised \"disciplined conduct\" and wandered around as a mad yogin, often behaving provocatively and seemingly mad. Having been born, the time was now ripe for the Heruka to \"enter into the action\" and, as already seen, he often did so in gatherings of people, or in fi:ont of kings and leaders. The Sobriquet: gTsang smyon-The Madman of gTsang-is Given After his enlightenment gTsang smyon had the following thought: \"Now, since I have completely reached the end of accomplishing my own purpose, it is time to work for the sake of others.\"607 He then entered into a meditative trance that enabled him to clearly per-ceive the three times (past, present and future) and with the eye of wisdom he saw how people in the degenerate times suffer from both outer prob-lems-such as diseases and poverty-and from inner disturbances-such as doubts, and wrong views. He also saw that it was difficult to help beings due to their many afflictions and shortcomings. In order to truly bring benefit to humans and other types of beings born under such difficult circumstances it is necessary to conceal one's own good qualities and practise disciplined conduct, he realized. \"[I will] move in all directions and carefully conceal my supreme qualities, being in accordance with the common people, [I will] 606 N: I b.

This he did in order to bring benefit to the beings of his time, and the unorthodox and often seemingly mad acts called \"disciplined conduct\" were done solely \"to benefit the beings and the Bud-dhist doctrine\" we are assured.609 gTsang smyon also made a deliberate choice to become a \"hidden yogin\" (sbas pa 'i rna! 'byort10 and by so doing he became able to teach people of a rough and irreligious nature that it would be hard to \"tame\" otherwise. His departure from Buddhist monasti-cism was thus based on an inner realization which arose from an altruistic mind. gTsang smyon's seemingly unorthodox behavior and strangeness were therefore in full accordance with Mahayana Buddhist doctrine, his disciples assure us. Although disciplined conduct and its many strange, provocative and see-mingly mad activities had been performed by gTsang smyon several times after he left his monastery, the authors of the rnam thars state that it was at this point, after his \"enlightenment\", that he began practising disciplined conduct on a wider scale. rGod tshang ras pa explains that the eighth chapter of the Heart oft he Sun is about \"how gTsang smyon roamed around the holy places and rugged charnel grounds and was completely victorious every-where by means of practising disciplined conduct.\"611 Also the verse by dNgos grub dpal 'bar that began this chapter describes this period of gTsang smyon's life, and it explains· how he perfected the conduct and practised disciplined conduct. It was at this point in his spiritual career that gTsang smyon became a mad yogin, and the term disciplined conduct-brtul zhugs-is a key term that all the three rnam thars use for the kind of conduct that he engaged in.612 The year of his enlightenment, which was the time when he definitely \"entered into the conduct,\" is not mentioned in the texts. Given the fact that he was twenty-one when he left his monastery and went to Tsari (according to Lha btsun), and then stayed there to practise for three years (according to 608 G: 37.

This would mean that he became a full-fledged heruka in 1475.613 It was also at this time that the sobriquet under which he became known-gTsang smyon (the Madman of gTsang)-was first used according to rGod tshang ras pa. As was seen in Chapter 1, gTsang smyon went naked into a gathering in Tsari, adorned with pieces of corpses and behaved very strangely. This he did after having thought about how he should \"benefit the Buddhist doctrine and the beings\" and the people who saw him, quite under-standably, started to call him the Madman of gTsang. What might appear more unusual is that they revered him very much and that the sobriquet was used as a type ofhonorific.614 It should be noted that neither dNgos grub dpal 'bar nor Lha btsun men-tion the incident, and it is of course possible that people called him gTsang smyon earlier.615 This was, as we have already seen, not the first time he behaved like a madman and it was definitely not the last time either. Action Before leaving Tsari, gTsang smyon stayed in a cave that was connected with the Four Armed Protector. Although gTsang smyon's main protector was Panjaranatha (Gur mgon)-a form of Mahakala that is mainly associ-ated with the Sa skya tradition-he wanted to establish a connection with the holy place. One night a black man appeared and started to fight with gTsang smyon. After a long and even fight the black man said: \"I am the Four Armed Protector, I am also the protector of the Aural Transmission of the l)akirus. Moreover I will be serving as your Dharma Protector, so erect some gtor mas as well. Tomorrow a giver of a book containing my practices will also come.\"616 As predicted by the black man; who was an emanation of the Four Armed Protector, a man came the following day and handed over a text containing the rituals needed to propitiate the Four Armed Protector.617 gTsang smyon thus changed his main protector and thereby became more thoroughly con-613 Lha btsun states that he was twenty-four (1475) when he was attacked by a group of tribal people (see below) and since this happened shortly after he became a heruka he probably was twenty-four(L: 32). 614 G: 37-38.

Li~e rGod tshang ras pa, Lha btsun mentions that the Four Armed Wisdom Protector appeared m reality, but does not mention any fight between gTsang smyon and the protector.

The people of gNyal had united against Bya, and a civil war was raging between the two districts. gTsang smyon's benefactor, the governor (nang so) of Bya, bKra shis dar rgyas, and his subjects were seriously threatened, and gTsang smyon decided to help his benefactor out. He performed a ceremony on behalf of bKra shis dar rgyas after which the people of Bya started to defeat the armies of gNyal.620 This made the leader of By a and his subjects very grateful and de-voted to the mad yogin. Having fulfilled his mission, gTsang smyon felt that he was no longer needed in Bya. He remembered that his lama had told him to roam the country with no fixed abode and to practise meditation at differ-ent remote and holy sites. Accompanied by his brother and sometimes by other persons as well/21 he left By a and his beloved Tsari and started a long journey that actually did not end until his death in 1507. Sometimes he stayed at the same place for some years, but he never settled permanently anywhere. rGod tshang ras pa summarizes his lifestyle eloquently: Then once again, [gTsang smyon] departed in the manner of a madman. Without any provisions whatsoever, he wandered aimlessly, in all directions. Completely fearless-like a lion; without doubts-like an elephant craving water; free from clinging-like the leaves of a tree agitated by the wind.622 Miraculous Powers I bow down to you, for whom even a rain of weapons on the vajra-body shone forth as an illusory empty appearance. 613 For a more detailed discussion about gTsang smyon's relation to the bKa' brgyud and Sa skya schools, see Larsson forthcoming a. 619 Spelled dMyal by dNgos grub dpal 'bar and Lha btsun. 620 N: 10 a. gTsang smyon's intervention in the conflict between Bya and gNyal is rendered also in L: 33 and in G: 38-39. As usual it is rGod tshang ras pa who gives the most detailed description. Cyrus Steams has summarized a small section of rGod tshang ras pa's account of this episode (Steams 2007: 73 ). 621 It is difficult to determine when gTsang smyon traveled alone and when he had compan-ions. In the latter case it is often unclear how many companions he had and who they were. It is often stated that his brother accompanied him and as we have already seen, gTsang smyon left mKhar kha together with him after having started his itinerant lifestyle. The two brothers probably kept company for many years afterwards, and gTsang smyon 's brother is mentioned from time to time in all three mam thars. 022 G: 41-42.

Without his miraculous powers he would not have lived long. gTsang smyon often deliberately sought out difficult and dangerous situa-tions, and we find many examples of how he displayed his miraculous pow-ers in the three rnam thars. gTsang smyon encountered one such situation not long after he had left Tsari and Bya. According to Lha btsun he was twenty-four (1475) when he walked along a small path inside a dense forest and was assaulted by the tribal people inhabiting the area. 624 these \"barbarians\" (kla klo), as the Ti-betans generally call them, have no faith in Buddhism and its basic princi-ples, and they sometimes attacked Buddhist pilgrims who entered their terri-tories.625 Patrul Rinpoche (dPal sprul Rin po che, 1808-1887) gives the fol-lowing explanation in The Words of My Perfect Teacher (Kun bzang bla ma'i zhallung): \"Barbarians\" [k/a klo] means those who live in the thirty-two border coun-tries, such as the Lokatra [klo kha khra], and all those who consider harming others an act of faith or whose savage beliefs see taking life as good. These people inhabiting the outlying territories have human form, but their minds lack the right orientation and they cannot attune themselves to the Dharma.626 As usual, it is rGod tshang ras pa who gives the most detailed account of what happened when gTsang smyon encountered the tribal people. It is therefore to the Heart of the Sun that we now will tum our attention.627 When gTsang smyon traveled together with his brother and two other companions, he suddenly said the following words to his fellow travelers: \"All of you should go up to that deep forest, stay there and take notice! Re-gardless of what I might do, there will be no need to be afraid, just keep your mouths shut and be completely aware!\" [gTsang smyon] went in advance and met some tribal people (mgo kha khra)628 who forcefhlly attacked him for about half a day with weapons such 623 N: lb.

When [at-tacked] the mighty yogin [gTsang smyon] remained in the meditative concen-tration called \"the unobstructed sky.\" The weapons could not hit his body but passed by him to the ground. No imprints whatsoever were shown and he did not even respond to their strokes. It was like hitting the sky and apart from wearing out their bodies nothing whatsoever happened. Then again, they se-parated [gTsang smyon's] head, arms and feet from each other and attached big stones to them. [Then they] throw each part in a big and deep river. The body itself and also the intestines were all separately thrown into the water. Then they took their loads on their backs and when they were preparing to leave [gTsang smyon] appeared in the middle of the deep river, without any damage on his body, just like before. After flying upwards, he snatched their weapons and loads, and threw them into the river. Some he caused great pain by slapping them on their face~ and for a while they all dispersed. Then they gathered again and after tying gTsang smyon's hands and feet with bamboo ropes, they placed him in the middle of a burning fire made of a heap of fire-wood; it resembled a small mountain. When the fire burned in the four direc-tions the great father siddha dwelled in \"the samadhi which is cooling and exhausts cold\". [The tribal people] fanned with clothes from every direction while screaming war cries that filled the area and [they] remained until the pieces of wood were consumed. Then the mighty yogin laughed, sang and danced, but apart from some phrases of the spiritual songs that he sang on that occasion, nothing was col-lected. Then the tribal people [found that the] body of the Lord was com-pletely without injuries or afflictions. They became scared and said, \"He must be mGon po Rog pa\"629 and all of them ran away.630 It should be noted that this is the first time it is mentioned that gTsang smyon sang spiritual songs (mgur). The songs were not recorded, but some phrases of them were remembered according to rGod tshangras pa. Having displayed his miraculous powers, gTsang smyon continued to tra-vel. rGod tshang ras pa describes how he roved about by means of disciplined conduct in absolutely terrifying places of evil spirits, such as charnel grounds, solitary trees, riverbanks, great steppes, empty houses, temples, narrow paths and market gatherings. In all the charnel grounds, provinces and valleys, such as. Kong po and sNya, he acted for the sake of many non-humans.631 628 One of the Tibetans that I read the text with understood this as rDo kha khra and saw it as a variant spelling of klo kha khra. kLo kha khra is the name used for a kind of tribal people who inhabit the borderlands between Tibet and Arunachal Pradesh. This is confirmed by Toni Huber who uses the term klo pa kha khra as a nineteenth-century term which possibly refers to a certain tribe of klo pa people west of Subansri in the Kameng district (Huber 1999: 254, n. 9). The fact that the tribal people used bamboo ropes supports this since the tribal people called klo pa use bamboo; they also are known for using poisoned arrows (see Huber 1999). Lha btsun terms the people blo kha khra (L: 33). 629 This is probably the name of some divinity that they believed in. 1'30 0: 39--40. For the Tibetan text, see Appendix 1. 1'31 0: 40.

The mas-ter of the story tames evil spirits and demons of various kinds and thereby improves the surroundings for the inhabitants of the area where the harmful non-human beings reside. The Tibetans of the 15th century, just like other people living in pre-modern societies, depended directly upon natural re-sources for their livelihoods which consisted of such activities as farming and herding. Like other people in their situation, they believed that various kinds of spirits, gods and demons could influence climate and harvests, and cause epidemics and diseases. A great master, such as Guru Rinpoche or Milarepa, could thus directly affect their circumstances and benefit people and animals by taming the harmful spirits and binding them under oath. By binding these local gods and demons under oath and making them promise not to cause harm, but to act in accordance with Buddhist principles, a Bud-dhist master could provide effective help in a direct and concrete way. gTsang smyon was no exception, and he often sought out harmful spirits, gods and demons and forced them to become benevolent. We find several such examples in the rnam thars. One such account is depicted in the Hearl of the Sun. On one occasion, gTsang smyon stayed in a cave that was connected with the eightfold group of spirits (sde brgyad}632 for a couple of days. That night many spirits gath-ered and attacked him with magical tricks. gTsang smyon subdued them, bound them under oath, and made them promise to carry out beneficial activ-ity in the future. 633 The Meeting with rGyal dbang chos rje gTsang smyon continued to display his miraculous powers and tame harmful beings of all kinds while he traveled around. Besides gods and demons, he also encountered many persons during his constant travels. Although he seemed to prefer to establish connections with kings and leaders, he occa-sionally met some contemporary famous Buddhist masters too. In the Heart of the Sun it is stated that he met the second Bar 'Brug pa bKa' brgyud hierarch, rGyal dbang chos rje ('Brug chen rGyal dbang kun dga' dpal 'byor, 1428-1476), in mKhar chu in Lho brag.634 Lho brag is fa-mous as the home district of Milarepa's teacher, Marpa, and it is situated in Southern Tibet close to the Bhutanese border. According to the hagiography of Milarepa, it was here that Milarepa met Marpa for the first time in the 11th century. Marpa ordered him to perform ascetic penance, and one of his or-632 There are various ways of making classifications of spirits.

He also infonns us that 'Brug chen was very pleased and gTsang smyon very satisfied with their discussions. Then gTsang smyon received teachings and empowerments from rGyal dbang chos rje. He received permission empowerment (rjes gnang) of the Four Armed Wisdom Protector, and teachings of the ritual practices (sgrub thab) of the lineage that had been transmitted from Zhang 'gro ba'i mgon po ( 1123-1193Y36 to gTsang pa rgya ras (1161-1211),637 and also of the lineage that had been transmitted from Phag mo gru pa rOo Ije rgyal po ( 1110-1170) to gLing ras pa Pad rna rdo Ije (1128-1188). gTsang smyon also received the Long-life Empowerment of Amitayus of Ras chung' s transmission. It is finally mentioned that gTsang smyon was ap-pointed Lord of Dharma (chos kyi bdag po) by the head of the 'Brug pa bKa' brgyud tradition.638 Establishing Connections with Powerful Leaders We have already seen examples of how gTsang smyon seemed to single out kings and leaders whom he provoked and eventually impressed with his miraculous powers and learning. This was a very important enterprise that seemed to contribute a great deal to the influence and success he finally ob-tained. With powerful supporters he acquired funding and support, which enabl~d him to act effectively \"for the sake of the beings and the Buddhist doctrine.\" rGod tshang ras pa describes how gTsang smyon assaulted a king and queen who came riding on their horses together with many followers in sNa dkar rtse.639 gTsang smyon grabbed the queen's horse by its mouth and pulled. Despite gTsang smyon's provocative and weird way of behaving, the queen showed no anger.

Lha btsun, on the other hand, mentions that a meeting between the two masters occurred, not in mKhar elm but in Ra lung, the main seat ofthe Bar 'Brug tradition (L: 40). 639 The meeting occured shortly after the above-mentioned meeting with the rGyal dbang chos rje. 129"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"es of coral and three other precious stones for his khatviinga.640 gTsang smyon predicted that the queen would give birth to three sons and two daughters as a result of her offering, and since things turned out just as he predicted everyone became very devoted.641 Continuing in the same spirit, gTsang smyon went by way of lCags rtse gri gu642 to bSam de at the eastern side of the upper end of the Yarlung val-ley. There .he met .the. king Grags pa mtha' yas641 with his retinue gathered for a party m the smgmg house (glu kl10ng).

Snatching the re-mammg beer from the hands of the king, the Lord poured from a silver vessel and drank.

This was not always the case, however. rGod tshang ras pa gives a couple of examples of occasions when gTsang smyon's strangeness did not give rise to such exalted feelings. When gTsang smyon arrived in Yar lungs tsha ba gru, for example, he went directly to the local leader in his usual marmer, but this time he received neither respect nor devotion. The leader and his followers remained indifferent to the mad yogin and this had a devastating result ac-cording to the Heart of the Sun. Only seven days after gTsang smyon's visit, the son of the leader drowned while playing in the water.647 640 There are different ways of transcribing this Sanskrit word with Tibetan letters, and J will stick to the standard Sanskrit transliteration regardless of how the Tibetans have transcribed it in the sources that I use.

Arriving in rTse thang, he sat on a large stiipa. While sitting there he was attacked by a group of very in-toxicated persons who felt provoked when seeing him. With a strong deter-mination to end the life of the mad yogin, the drunks threw stones at him and stabbed him with different weapons. Despite this, by remaining evenly in the hard and solid vajra-like meditative concentration, knives were not able to cut through, and knives and lances used for harming him became bent. \"This person must have a 'weapon-protection',\" they said.648 Then, draw-ing their knives across their behinds and feet, they attacked him repeatedly.649 The Lord thought to himself, \"In general, [one needs to] obtain a human body with freedoms and endowments.650 So, in particular, what need is there to even mention [the need to] enter into the teachings of the Buddha, becom-ing ordained and accomplish liberation. [These people] do not accomplish the happiness of the higher realms, but accumulate only actions of the lower realms.

One of the persons [who attacked gTsang smyon] said, \"He has a power-ful weapon-protection indeed. Knives do not hurt him but still stones might be of use.\" Another one said, \"Even if wounds do not arise maybe there is pain?'' Then one of them said, \"Do not attack him npw, he is not our enemy.\" After having said this, they all left. The body of the Lord was not harmed and he felt no anger, instead it was as if a rain of flowers had fallen upon him.652 The account presents gTsang smyon as a true bodhisattva who felt love and compassion even towards the most evil-minded persons. His way of acting corresponds to the way in which a bodhisattva should act. rGyal sras thog med (1295-1369) expresses one of the main practices of a bodhisattva as follows in Thirty-Seven Practices of a Bodhisattva: For a bodhisattva who desires the joys of virtue, All who harm him are like a precious treasure. 648 \"Weapon protection\" (mtshonsnmg) is a kind of blessed object worn on the body to pro-tect the wearer from harm caused by weapons. 649 To defile a weapon in this way is believed to make a weapon-protection amulet ineffective. 650 According to Buddhist doctrine, a human being must possess eigth freedoms (dal) and ten endowments ( 'byor) to be able to take full advangage of his or her human birth. For an enu-meration and explanation of them, see, for example, Kongtrul 1986: 31-33; Patrul Rinpoche I 994: 19-29. 651 This expression gives the impression that the drunken people who attacked gTsang smyon were monks, and although this is one possibility it is hard to determine the identity of the drunks. 652 G: 42-43.

Both the Fifth Dalai Lama's history of Tibet and the New Red Annals refer to him.661 He was the son of the Drung chen Grags pa dpal bzang and his wife, sKalldan rin chen bzang mo, and was sometimes called Drung chen dPal 'byor rgyal po.662 From his father he had inherited the right to rule the region around Lhasa and beyond.663 dPal 'byor rgyal po's mother was one of Thang stong rgyal po's main patrons in Central Tibet, and he thus knew that some great masters behaved in seem-ingly mad ways.664 gTsang smyon could not resist the opportunity to establish a connection with such an important leader.

Convinced he was a riik~asa demon (srin po), the assembled people ran away. The crowded market was emptied, and people went into hiding in their houses. gTsang smyon spent the night under a single willow tree.

This had a profound impact on the people of Lhasa. However, Thang stong rgyal po's eccentric ways had made the people suspicious. It is said that some accused him of being a demon ( 'dre) while others held him to be a non-Buddhist.671 Nevertheless, the siddha's stay in Lhasa seems to have paved the way for gTsang smyon. We have already seen that when people saw how gTsang smyon urinated in his tsam pa and ate it, they speculated whether gTsang smyon could be Thang stong rgyal po. Had it not been for Thang stong rgyal po's previous visit it would perhaps have been more like-ly that everyone would have held gTsang smyon to be a demon without even considering the other possibilities.

He specifically mentioned that only certain persons are qualified to engage in the conduct. Moreover, the conduct should only be carried out at the proper time and in the right place. The conduct must also be done among the right associates, and finally it is important to have correct reasons for doing it and the way in which the conduct is acted out must also be right. gTsang smyon said that his way of acting and appearing had been explained in many Buddhist scriptures and it could also be understood if one used logical reasoning. Countless tantras supported it, and if some dialecticians did not know this, there was nothing he could do about it.677 All the dge bshes could say in reply was: \"Now is not the time for such a conduct of the Secret Mantra.\" [To this gTsang smyon said:] \"Well then, is it time for the conduct of the Secret Mantra when one is bom in the eight unfavourable states?678 Where is it explained that now is not the time for the practice of Secret Mantra?\" Not daring to say anything whatsoever from scriptures or established rea-soning [the dge bshes] rose from the rows and left The ruler (sde pa) offered [gTsang smyon] respect and service with supreme devotion.679 gTsang smyon then left dPal 'byor lhun po and went to Chu shu!, a small township about 35 km south of Lhasa.

Predictably enough, gTsang smyon stepped up in front of one of the leaders, grabbed his beer and drank it. His provocative behavior did not go unnoticed. The sol-diers became upset and threatened gTsang smyon with their weapons. gTsang smyon defended himself with his tantric staff (kha{viinga) and they became afraid. One of their leaders then said that he had had a dream about Saraha the previous night, and this dream was probably a premonition of gTsang smyon's arrival. \"He is an extraordinary yogin, offer him prostra-tions,\" said the leader, and then he requested blessings from gTsang smyon himself.680 gTsang smyon then decided that he should return to mKhar kha and visit his mother.681 He had not seen her for some four years, and as we have al-ready seen, he had a strong bond with her.

Chu bar is situated close to another of Milarepa's favorite places of meditation-La phyi-and numerous caves where Milarepa and his close disciples used to meditate are found in the area. As mentioned above, gTsang smyon had always felt a particularly strong faith towards Milarepa, and he now wanted to literally follow in his foot-steps, and also fulfill the final instructions of his guru, Sha ra ba, namely: \"Give up the eight worldly concerns and set the victory ban-ner of practice in the bKa' brgyud great holy sites such as Tsari rtsa gong, La phyi, Chu bar, Gangs Ti se, and the Six Forts.\"683 His mother did not like the idea of her beloved son roaming around as a mad vagabond with no fixed abode, and she told him that he should return to dPal 'khor chos sde, the monastery where he had studied previously. \"Please stay once again in dPal 'khor sde chen and practise in that lovely place where you first [studied] dharma,\" his mother told him.684 She did not give gTsang smyon permission to leave and her son had to ask her repeat-edly.

The two brothers did not go to Chu bar directly but took a roundabout way. Instead of going south-west, they traveled north-west through the southern parts of Northern La stod. According to Lha btsun, gTsang smyon was twenty-five years old when he left mKhar kha, and after having traveled for a while he arrived at the foot of dPal chen ri bo che.688 This monastic complex was built by Thang stong rgyal po in Western La stod byang on a scorpion-shaped mountain, on the northern shore of the gTsang po river in the valley of gCung. The com-plex consisted of two monasteries, one at the foot of the mountain and one on its peak. In addition, there was a stiipa and an iron bridge.689 We have already seen that gTsang smyon was sometimes mistaken for Thang stong rgyal po, and according to the life stories he wanted to meet the great siddha who was probably I IS years old at the time (1476).690 It is noteworthy that gTsang smyon very seldom visited other Buddhist masters after having ob-tained enlightenment. That he wished to see the bridge-building siddha shows that he--or if the story is invented, his disciples-held Thang stong rgyal po to be of particular importance. Like gTsang smyon, Thang stong rgyal po was known for practising disciplined conduct, and it is thus possible that the siddha was a source of inspiration for him. Cyrus Steams mentions that Thang stong rgyal po and gTsang smyon were the most important mad yogins in terms of their lasting influence on Tibetan culture and religion. He also suggests that \"the account of their meeting portrays the continuity of the tradition of religious madness in Tibet and heralds the appearance of Tsang Nyon [gTsang smyon] as the next great mad yogin.''~>91 dNgos grub dpal 'bar depicts their meeting as follows in the Lion of Faith: Then, with his_ brother(dbon po) as his attendant, he traveled through La stod byang and arnved _at the foot of dPal chen ri bo che.

The great adept jerked his head back and cried, \"Ow! Ow!\" The lord remarked, \"What kind of great adept is this? He cries out in pain, unable to bear even the sting of his beard.\" The great adept laughed, and said with embarrassment, \"A fine auspicious connection. Offer me that garment of yours. \"694 It is hard to know if meetings such as this actually occurred. It is possible that the hagiographers inserted such accounts just to retrospectively create lineage affiliations that did not exist in the first place. Other possible reasons could be to show the importance of the master, or perhaps, to make the life story more interesting. Given the fact that dNgos grub dpal 'bar does not mention the meeting between rGyal dbang chos rje and gTsang smyon that was related above, for example, one might suspect that the meeting could be fabricated. On the other hand, it is also possible that dNgos grub dpal 'bar, either did not know about such a meeting, or if he knew about it did notre-gard it as important enough to be included into his rather short rnam thar.

At this point gTsang smyon had once again managed to obtain the strange paraphernalia that his mother did not want him to carry around. As so often before when meeting kings and leaders, gTsang smyon went up to the king, who was eating, without observing any respectful behavior. \"Holding a skull-cup with some strands of hair attached (bhan dha Ieang lo can) in his left hand and a thigh-bone trumpet with a human hand attached to it in his right hand he went inside unhindered, and said: 'Serve me some food'.'>696 Nam mkha' stob rgyal said that gTsang smyon had to prostrate to him if he wanted food. gTsang smyon then prostrated in a very awkward way, turn-ing his back to the king and only using one of his hands. His strange prostra-tion caused everyone present to burst into laughter. They treated gTsang smyon with great respect and served him nice food. The leader of Tsha mda', Nam mkha' stob rgyal, then ordered some learned monk-scholars (dge bshes) to check gTsang smyon's knowledge and ask him questions. The leader ascertained that gTsang smyon was a genuine yogin and developed faith in him. Before parting, he said, \"Lama, if you stay in La phyi I will offer you practice-provisions (bsgrub rgyags).\"697 gTsang smyon promised to visit La phyi and meditate there, but at a later date, since his destination at this time was Chu bar.698 Having won over yet another powerful benefactor, gTsang smyon contin-ued towards Chu bar. Before going there, he went to a charnel ground that the Indian master Pha dam pa Sangs rgyas had visited in earlier times. The charnel ground is situated in bLang 'khor, near Ding ri, and it was a very frightening place, according to rGod tshang ras pa. lt was the abode of the Qiikini field protectors-the five Kun Qa 1i sisters-and a naga demon with a snake skull.

In going to such places gTsang smyon, as an embodiment of a heruka, the main deity of the mar.H;Iala, thus returned to the place where he belonged. When the winter came, gTsang smyon met several traders on a combined trading and pilgrimage trip to the Svayambhii Stiipa in Nepal.711 He joined company with a group of traders that was led by a certain lama dPon ri ba.712 gTsang smyon showed no respect towards the lama which made the lama's male and female followers angry.

The Tibetans call the statue Bod thang mgon po, and it was of great importance for gTsang smyon.714 All the three rnam thars agree that gTsang smyon's first trip to Nepal occurred after his meeting with Thang stong rgyal po, and since Lha btsun states that gTsang smyon was twenty-five years old when he met the famous siddha, and twenty-six when he returned to Tibet.715 gTsang smyon probably visited Nepal for the first time around 1477.716 The rnam thars describe how several miracles occurred when gTsang smyon visited the Mahakala statue. While gTsang smyon was performing expiatory rituals (skangs bshags) and exhortations (sku/) in front of the protector it started to move. It was as if heaven and earth were about to break into piec-es, and the statue became as huge as a mountain and started to dance vio-lently. This did not scare gTsang smyon, who took the protector by the hands and started to dance with him.717 Several Nepalese and Tibetans who had assembled there saw the spectacle, and gTsang smyon's powers were thus displayed to the people.718 gTsang smyon then went to the Svayambhii Stiipa. rGod tshang ras pa ends his eighth chapter that concerned how gTsang smyon practised disciplined conduct with this account of the visit to Nepal.

At that time, he had the following visions of his prototype, Milarepa: While abiding evenly in the state of River-flow Samadhi for about one month, he had many visionary encounters with Mila ras pa, who would some-times teach his life story, sometimes give compassionate advice, sometimes teach dharma, sometimes display miracles, and so on.723 This was a premonition of one of gTsang smyon's most important endeav-ours, namely the compilation and propagation of the life story and songs of Milarepa. gTsang smyon then went to La phyi where he meditated in caves associ-ated with the cotton-clad yogin for a while.724 Then he continued to gNya' nang (modem-day Nyalam), north-west of La phyi. In gNya' nang he stayed in the Stomach Cave (Grod phug) for a couple of weeks, meditating in com-plete silence.72s When he had completed his meditation in the cave he heard that many monks were gathering nearby to perform wishing prayers to Mai-treya. gTsang smyon decided to go there too.

His behavior and provoca-tions might be seen as some kind of teaching in themselves, but they were also a kind of practice. At this point, while gTsang smyon was in his late twenties, perhaps twenty-seven or twenty-eight, he started to teach in a more traditional way. He had an inner realization of the profound meaning of the Buddhist doctrine, which he had refined and tested thoroughly by means of disciplined conduct. The time was thus ripe to communicate his understand-ing to others. gTsang smyon started to express his insight through spiritual songs (mgur) and he also gave teachings (khrid) and empowerments (dbang). Moreover, he started to compose and print texts. An important re-sult of these activities is that he started to amass disciples. gTsang smyon Starts to Compose Texts and Sing Songs of Realization Having explained the nature of his madness to the monks in gNya' nang, gTsang smyon returned to Chu bar.

You withstood the hardship of drinking (only) water, and perfected austerity. Your body burned with the heat of bliss, and on your form a few cotton clothes you wore. You realized the meaning of equanimity, and clear light was for you an un-broken stream. Respectfully I prostrate at the feet of Milarepa! As for you, madman and bum, you can't bear hardship; you're lazy. Your being is immature; you're a fake. The thought of approaching death does not occur to you, and through various and sundry defilements, you are a desecrator of the especially holy site of Mi-la. 0, great Reverend Lord, have pity on this one!764 In response to bSam grub Ide's many accusations gTsang smyon sang a song (mgur) that resembled the song that Milarepa sang to Dam pa sangs rgyas, which was cited at the beginning of this dissertation.

So, were I to sing a song of how the king is right about all the stories of madness and the like, the noble Tathagatas with their retinues, smiling in wonder and joy, would finally burst out in laughter: such marvellous madness as this! I am mad with the view of unity beyond extremes. I am mad with meditation which doesn't grasp at clarity and emptiness. I am mad with conduct which overwhelms dread [nyams nga thog Brdzis]. I am mad with the ground beyond all exaggeration. I am mad with the path of abandoning sin and practising virtue. I am mad with the fruits of self-recognition. Having madness as the basis, yet again, shaken by demons, I am mad. The demon of the bKa' brgyud blessings has possessed me. The demoness of the c)iikinis' enlightened actions is at work.

Just as when he explained his madness, he used each negative word in a positive way, and thus managed to show that his way of being mad and lazy and so forth was not conventional.

However, other people of the area still entertained doubts about gTsang smyon. While he was teaching the Great Vehicle (theg pa chen po, Mahiiyiina) to a large number of people, some slandered him and said, \"In general, now is not the time to practise and meditate according to the Secret Mantra; and in particular, this kind of [explanation of] the view, meditation and action is not taught by the Buddha (thub pa) ... \"771 gTsang smyon invited some of the people who \"were devoted to the inferior vehi-cles\"772 to a debate and refuted their wrong views by means of logical rea-soning and scriptural citations. He then sang \"The Great Song of the True Meaning-The Roar of the Selfless Lion that Subdues and Frightens the Small Prey of the Inferior Vehicle.\"773 gTsang smyon's age when he sang these songs is not stated in the hagio-graphies. But since Lha btsun stated that he was thirty (1481) when he went to Ti se, and then states that he spent three years meditating in the Six Forts after that trip, he was probably about thirty-four (1485) when he sang the songs.774 767 Collected Songs of gTsang smyon Heruka: 8b: rna shes na sangs rgyas kyi yon tan thams cad kyang I I so skyes lam Ia blo rna sbyangs pa dang I log Ita can rnams Ia skyon du snang stel. 768 Collected Songs ofgTsang smyon Heruka: 8b: chos thams cad rna rtogs pa rnams Ia 'khor bar snang lrtogs naye gdod rna nas mya ngan las 'das pa'i bde ba chen po yin I. 769 Collected Songs of gTsang smyon Heruka: 8b. 77° Collected Songs of gTsang smyon Heruka: 8b. m Collected Songs of gTsang smyon Heruka: 9b: spyir gyis da Ita gsang sngags dang sgom pa nyams su len pa'i dus rna yin zhing I I khyad par Ita sgom spyod pa 'di 'dra !hub pas rna 9Jwngs pas kham ches zer lkog lab mang du byung ba las. 2 Collected Songs ofgTsang smyon Heruka: 9b: thegdman Ia mas pa'i gang zag. 773 Collected Songs of gTsang smyon Heruka: 9b: theg dman gyi ri dags phra mo mams skrag cing zit gyis gnon par byed pa bdag med seng ge 'i ngar skad nges pa don gyi mgur chen 'di 9sungs so I.

Composing the Life and Songs of Milarepa dNgos grub dpal 'bar explains how the king of Gung thang did not want gTsang smyon to leave the Mang yul gung thang area. gTsang smyon there-fore had to sneak away without anyone noticing. He then went to his favorite places La phyi and Tsari again. After having meditated for a year in La phyi, at the age ofthirt)r-five (1486)776 he reached Tsari.777 There he meditated for three years, and while he was there he also composed some texts that were later incorporated in his Aural Transmission compilation. At the age of thirty-eight (1489)m he decided to return to La phyi. There he began what was to become one of his most important deeds, the compila-tion and printing of the life story and song collection of his great role model, Milarepa. All three rnam thars about gTsang smyon describe-in a rather detailed way-why and how the life story and the collection of songs of Milarepa were made.779 According to these accounts, gTsang smyon's inten-tion was to popularize and spread Milarepa's life story and thereby benefit all beings.780 It should be noted that Milarepa's life story was completed in 1488 according to the colophon of the text itself.181 This information contra-dicts Lha btsun's account, which states that gTsang smyon started the work in 1489 and completed it after two years.782 This would mean that Milarepa's life story was completed in 1491. Having successfully completed the print-ing of the Milarepa texts, gTsang smyon dispersed many copies of the texts 775 This has also been noted by Steams [Kalnins]l985: 33. 776 L: 90. 777N: 14b. 778 L: 93. 779G: 130; 137-153;L:97-98;N: 16a-16b. 780 Andrew Quintman recently made a thorough examination of these sections of the rnam thars of gTsang smyon (Quint man 2006: 195-209).

There he met the so-called \"middle ruler\" of gLo bo, A Seng rdo rje brtan pa (died c. 1496 ), who had succeeded bKra shis mgon on the throne.785 In gLo bo, gTsang smyon impressed the ruler and his followers by defeating the local dge bshes in debate while drinking copi-ous quantities ofbeer.786 gTsang smyon then went back to La phyi where he went into a retreat for three years. During this time he wrote many texts that later became part of his Aural Transmission compilation.787 Continuing his itinerant life-style, at age forty-three ( 1494) he went to nearby Chu bar where he meditated for yet another year.788 In Chu bar he gave complete instructions and empowerments of the Aural Transmission, and the next summer he went to Crystal Cave (She! phug) where he gave blessings, teachings and empowerments to many people.789 gTsang smyon had assembled a great number of disciples and patrons at this point and he decided that he should go to whitewash the Svayambhii Stiipa in Nepal.790 Before he departed for Nepal he went to mKhar kha to perform ceremonies for his mother who had passed away.791 In mKhar kha he also started to amass the requisites needed for whitewashing the Stiipa.

The father siddha asked them where they were going. They replied, \"We are going to sell these [women).\" Although the great siddha had thoroughly understood the equality of sam-sara and nirvana, compassion captured him. From the lotuses of his eyes a ro-sary of tears flowed, without interruption, individual pearls, similar to the continuous flow of a mighty river. His maQc;lala-face became wet.

Finally gTsang smyon was requested to give a lecture and he replied: \"Naturally!

The entire assembly was amazed, not only by gTsang smyon's exceptional learning, but also by the fact that he managed to finish off the beer he was served.

They expressed their worries and concerns for his life and limbs if he attempted to do it. gTsang smyon comforted them with the fol-lowing words: This advice of yours shows that you haven't abandoned your affection to-wards me, but there is no need to have this kind of worry. The activity of mine, the Madman of gTsang, will be accomplished by the Qakinis, Dharma Protectors and the Eight Kinds of Oath Bound Ones (dam can sde brgyad). It is not necessary for me to collect the offerings; there will spontaneously be enough materials for the reparation.824 gTsang smyon then started to gather the necessary materials and funding for the renovation. He used his large network of patrons and disciples to accom-plish the task. Having collected the necessary things, gTsang smyon, a large group of disciples, and other voluntary participants in the renovation project, went to Nepal. On the way, he met the Seventh Karmapa, Chos grags rgya mtsho ( 1451-1502), one of the most important and influential Buddhist masters of the time.

Af-ter having performed the necessary rituals and ceremonies, the rotten wood of the dharma wheels (chos skor)828 and the parasol (gdug, chattra) were dismantled. At that point many of the Tibetans that were there to help with the restoration became afraid that an epidemic would come. They also feared that they might die from the heat if they stayed. Even some of gTsang smyon's own disciples started to lose their courage. Many people therefore returned to Tibet again and only the most faithful disciples of gTsang smyon remained.829 The loss of the Tibetan volunteers did not discourage gTsang smyon, and he found many other people who wanted to participate in the work.K30 Towards the end of the project several obstacles arose. A swarm of bees attacked the workers and heavy rains made the work difficult. gTsang smyon managed to dispel the obstacles and the wor_k continued. When they had renovated the whole stilpa and also the surrounding chapels and pathways, and only had to whitewash the stiipa and perform a consecration ceremony, a wind arose and swept away all dirt and unwanted materials. The area around the stiipa became clean and beautiful as if an expert cleaner had made every-thing very clean. On the actual day of the consecration, offerings from gods and non-humans filled the area.

He sent for master calligraphers, and bDag chen chos rje and his family offered a great deal of paper. Unfortu-nately, a strong wind came and scattered the paper. gTsang smyon had to postpone his plans, and he made a few ordinary copies of his compilation instead.842 gTsang smyon then told his disciples to proofread his compilation and come to him to clear up any doubts or uncertainties that they might have. Otherwise, they would have much regret when he was gone, he said.843 Having completed the Aural Transmission compilation, gTsang smyon's largest literary effort, and one of his main missions in life, gTsang smyon said: I have dedicated myself fully to the sNyan brgyud and the Reverend Lord Mi Ia's Life.

There was a small veranda to stay on during the days [outside of his medita-tion cave] and there they made a resting place. Besides [gTsang smyon] the offerings and gtor mas were arranged and extensive dedication-rituals were performed.

In the Heart of the Sun it is mentioned that, while gTsang smyon was staying in sMan khab, a certain mDzad kram pa remarked that: \"Many true yogins of India had the hand symbols, the heruka implements, and the long hair and so forth, of the Secret Mantra vehicle, but in Tibet, be-sides a few with long and matted hair, no one before the Lord [gTsang smyon) had the completely perfect heruka implements. At present there are many who dress like this [with heruka outfit) outwardly, but are without qualities or realization. As for us disciples, if we have no perm;ssion, we are not allowed to have the manner and garments of a heruka. Concerning this, what inner experience, realization and qualities are needed for someone to be allowed to use the heruka garments?\"882 This is an interesting question since it implies that mDzad khram pa consid-ered gTsang smyon to be the first person in Tibet who acted and dressed like the Indian siddhas used to do, namely with the full heruka garments (heru ka'i chas): six bone ornaments: (1) crown ornament (dbu rgyan), (2) ear rings (rna rgyan), (3) necklace (mgul rgyan), (4) bracelets (lag gdub), (5) Brahmin cord (mchod phyir thogs) and (6) anklets (rkang gdub), and also other things such as a tiger-skin skirt (stag sham). According to the Heart of the Sun, gTsang smyon was thus historically important since he was the first Tibetan heruka. In this chapter, sMan khab's question will be addressed in a somewhat de-tailed fashion. What do Indian and Tibetan 'tantric Buddhist texts and mas-ters actually say about these matters?

At the end of the chapter we will have a look at gTsang smyon's own an-swer to sMarr khab's question, but first both the Indian and Tibetan explana-tions of these practices will be presented. Precursors and Parallels to Tantric Buddhism Many of the unusual and seemingly crazy practices that are described in the hagiographies of gTsang smyon originate in India. In the block-print pictures and statues that have been preserved, gTsang smyon looks similar to an In-dian Buddhist siddha.883 Like these siddhas, he resembles a Saiva yogin, es-pecially the now extinct Kapalika yogins who are described in a somewhat similar fashion.884 gTsang smyon is portrayed with long hair tied up in a topknot, and his ears are decorated with large round earrings. He is usually depicted with a mustache and a small beard. His eyes are open and he is looking straight forward. In his right hand he holds a vajra, and in his left hand a skull-cup. His tantric staff is usually standing upright behind him, and he is often de-picted with a meditation belt. His body is adorned with various kinds of bone ornaments, and he is naked, or dressed only in a small loin-cloth. Sometimes he sits in vajra-posture, but more often his right leg is slightly extended. His outer appearance is thus very different from that of a Buddhist monk, and as we have seen, so was his behavior. Above, we saw many examples of how gTsang smyon practised asceti-cism, going around naked, living in caves and charnel grounds and wander-ing around with no fixed abode. These types of ascetic practices had existed in India long before Buddhism, and they also constitute an important ele-883 Block-print pictures of gTsang smyon are found in many of the works related to the so-called \"gTsang smyon school.\" See, for example, G: 3, L: 2; N: I b; Bya bra! pa Tshul khrims dpal !dan 1544: 1 a; Byams pa phun tshogs 1976: 452; Collected Songs of gTsang smyon Heruka: I b; Lha btsun gyi rnam mgur 1976: 27 5; Lha btsun Rin chen rnam rgyal 1543: 1 a; Lha btsun rin chen mam rgyal, rGyud kyi dgongs pa gtsor ston pa phyag rgya chen po yig ge bzhi pa'i 'brei bshad gnyug ma'i gter mdzod ces bya ba 1561: I b; rNa!

Even nowadays some Indian Saiva yo gins such as the Aghoris look and behave in ways that resemble gTsang smyon, at least in some respects.

What appears to be extreme or even crazy conduct is thus better understood as a form of ascetic discipline, a discipline with deep roots in Indian traditions.885 A hymn in the ~g Veda describes a long haired ascetic (Kesin) as being \"Crazy with asceticism.\"886 The hymn also associates this ascetic with the god Rudra, which indicates that the Kesin was on the margin of Vedic soci-ety. It should further be noted that the god Rudra was eventually transform-ed into, and identified as, the god Siva. The Indian Buddhist siddhas resembled the Sa iva yo gins, and both groups of practitioners followed a path with simi-lar methods and practices.887 According to Ronald Davidson, the three Saiva sects that most influenced the Buddhist siddha practice were the Kapalika, Kaula and Pasupata denominations.888 One of the most notable features of the Pasupata practice is an ascetic ob-servance (vrata) which consists of four successive stages of discipline.889 During the second, so-called \"un-marked\" (avyakta) stage, the Pasupata yogin was supposed to act like a madman. He was to leave the temple and abandon the identifying marks of his sect. Without anyone knowing his true identity (as a Pasupata yogin), he was to go to places where people could see him and deliberately and publicly act in ways that resembled a mad person's behavior. 890 The Kapalikas, so called because they carried a kapii/a (a human skull), lived in the cremation grounds where they practised a form of asceticism that was even more outrageous and antinomian than that of the Pasupatas. The Kapalikas worshiped the ferocious forms of Siva, such as Bhairava and his consort Bhairavl, whom they emulated in a quite literal way, which made them rather controversial and also feared. The Kapalikas practised an obser-vance (vrata) called kiipii/avrata (skull-observance) or mahiivrata (great observance)891 and they had a number of visible attributes that made them 885 Mad behavior is also common in Indian devotionalism (bhakti). See, for example, Kinsley 1974; McDaniel 1989; Yocum 1983. In my opinion, bhakti-madness is of another type than the madness of the Tibetan mad yogins, and it will therefore not be examined here. 886 ~g Veda !0.136,3a: unmadita mauneyena.

See, for example, Sanderson 1990; Sanderson 1994; Sanderson 2001. 888 Davidson 2002: 177. 889 This vrata is sometimes called paiupatavrata. There are different ways of enumerating the stages. According to some they followed three stages (for example, Flood 1996: 156-157), and according to others, five stages (for example, Davidson 2002: 183). The differences con· cern the last stages that either could be counted as one, two or three. Since it is the first two stages that concern us here these different ways of counting are irrelevant 890 See, for example, Lorenzen 1991: 185.

The importance of the skull is indicated by their name, but it is important to be aware of the fact that both the skull and the staff were equally important to the Lakulisa Pasupatas and to many of the Buddhist siddhas; they too were skull bearers-Kapalikas-but of a different kind. For the Saiva Kapalikas it was not enough to invoke and worship Siva. They instead wanted to become Siva and thus emulated the god in their own behavior and outlook. Gavin Flood points out that \"the goal of the Kapalika was power (siddhi) which he thought he could achieve through breaking social ta-boos.\"893 Alexis Sanderson notes that the Kapalika culture ofthe cremation ground also permeates the Kaula or Kula tradition.894 This tradition contained many transgressive practices and those who followed the tradition were known to use impurities as a means to gain magical power.895 The Kuliirr:zava Tantra, for example, encourages the participants in a certain ritual to behave like mad persons, and \"this behavior carried into the public domain is intended to indicate the supremacy of the kula path.\"896 The female goddesses/spirits around which their cult was centered are known as yoginis. The term Kau-la/Kula refers to families of yoginis who are retinues of tantric deities and their consorts.897 l)akini is a general term that could be used as an equivalent of both yogini and devi, and like these terms it could refer to both humans and non-humans (i.e. goddesses). Adelheid Herrmann-Pfandt states that the word Qakini' is explained in tantric Buddhist texts as \"female skygoer\" (iikiiSagiiminf).898 This explains why the Tibetans translated the term as \"mkha' 'gro\" or \"mkha' 'gro ma\", which means \"skygoer\" and \"female sky-goer\", respectively. The term c.lakini was used by both Hindus and Bud-dhists, and early examples of the use of the tenn are found in texts dating back to the 3'ct to S'h century.899 It should be observed that Qakini is a term of great importance for gTsang smyon; one of the most central transmission lineages that he practised and disseminated was sometimes called the Aural Transmission of the !)akin is (mKa' 'gro snyan brgyud)-a lineage originat-ing in oral teachings of a non-human c.lakini'. 892 Riimanuja lists six primary signs of kiipiilika worship: a necklace, a neck ornament, large earrings, a jewel in their hair, ashes and a sacred thread (Riimanuja cited in Lorenzen 1972: 2). 8<[1 Flood 1996: 165. 8'!4 Sanderson 1990: 13R-139. \"\"5 Flood 1996: I 90. \"\"' Braveman 2003: 222. xn Flood 1996: 166. x•>x llcmnann-Pfandt 1992 a: 46.

Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah has pointed out that there is a well-entrenched duality within the Sangha between those monks who are labeled village or town dwellers (Pali: giimaviisilnagaraviisl) and those who are labeled forest dwellers (Pali: iiraiiiiaviisilvanaviisi).900 The latter emulated the meditative and itinerant life-style of the Buddha and his early followers, while the for-mer settled down and often devoted their time to study and rituals. The individual practices of the forest monks are called dhutagUI:za (Pali: dhutanga).901 These practices are described in both Theravada and Mahayana texts and two formulations became standard: a thirteen-item list in the for-mer tradition, and a twelve-item list in the latter.902 Several of the practices enumerated concern one's place of residence. Monks who abide by one of these dhutagw:za practices should live in a forest, under a tree, in the open air or in charnel grounds. The monks who adhere to these ascetic practices are thus homeless wanderers, and in early Buddhism this kind of life-style seems to have been preferred. Although the monks were encouraged to travel and live the life of a homeless renunciate, since there was no rule against settling down, some monks abandoned the itinerant life-style of their founder and started to live permanently in what were to become the first monasteries.903 This was the starting point of the monasticization that was to become of pivotal importance for the development of Buddhism. The monasteries be-came increasingly larger, and considerable changes took place regarding the life-style of the monks. Gombrich has stated that \"most of these changes can be seen as a move away from asceticism\" and that \"the general tendency of early developments was towards an easier life for monks.'>904 900 Tambiah 1984: 53. For a detailed study of the meditative and non-monastic side of Bud-dhism, see Ray 1994. 901 These practices are described in Visuddhimagga, see Buddhaghosa I 999: 58-8 I. 902 The two lists are almost identical and since i 1 is the Mahayana list that became used in Tibetan Buddhism i 1 is sufficient I o enumerate this list: (I) wear rags taken fi·om a refuse heap (piif!riukiilika, gos phyag dar khrod pa), (2) wear the three (monastic) robes (traicivarika, c/ws gos gsum pa), (3) wear garments of felt (niimatiko, phying ba pa), (4) live on alms food (pair.u,lapiitika, bsod snyoms pa), (5) follow one-eating (aikasanika, stan gcig pa), (6) not eat after (the time when one should cease) (khalupascadbhaktika, zas phyis mi len pa), (7) dwell in the forest (iira~yaka, dgon pa ba), (8) live at the foot of a tree (vr/cyamii/ika, siring dnmg pa), (9) live in the open air (iibhyavakiisika, bla gab med pa), (10) live in charnel grounds (smiisiinika, dur khrod pa), (II) remain in a sitting posture, not lying down (nai~adika, tsog fc\" ba), (12) accept any seat that may be offered (yiithiisaf!ISiarika,gzhiji bzhinpa). 03 According to Gregory Schopen permanent dwellings for the monks are not attested in the archaelogical records until around the beginning of the Common Era (Schopen 2007: 61). 904 Gombrich 1984: 80-81. 178"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"As referred to above, the forest-monks had primarily been devoted to the vocation of meditation and practice, while the vocation of those monks who settled down in towns and villages was that of books and learning.905 Every monk, regardless of type (i.e. forest or village) should ideally combine these two different pursuits, but in reality there was a tendency to separate study and meditation. There were even some monks who argued that it was possi-ble to obtain enlightenment without meditation.906 The tendency of separat-ing study and meditation is still visible in many Buddhist countries.907 It thus seems that the ascetic, homeless and wandering life-style of the monks often gave way to the more comfortable life of settled, institutional-ized monasticism. From time to time however revivalist movements appear, and charismatic forest-type monks become popular and new proselytes join their way of life. Paradoxically, the forest monks who strive for a secluded and solitary life thus sometimes obtain large followings and many donations. This is another potential danger for their secluded and ascetic life-style. The tension between the ascetic monks of the forests and mountains with their focus on meditation and the monks of the monasteries with their focus upon studies seems to be ever present in the history ofBuddhism.908 However, it is important to note that both life-styles and their respective vocations were and are considered important in Buddhism.909 The two sides were/are mutually interdependent, since it is impossible to practise and meditate without a tra-dition which maintains the Buddhist teachings. There are several interesting similarities between the monks who carried out the dhutagufJD practices and the mad yo gins of Tibet. Both groups lived the life of homeless wanderers and devoted much of their time to secluded meditation practice. Both, moreover, sometimes lived in charnel grounds and even dressed in clothes or shrouds taken from corpses. \"Given Indian fas-tidiousness about death pollution\" this practice must have been considered 905 See, for example, Tambiah 1984:53. 906 Gombrich has described this as an ancient debate attested in the canonical Pali scriptures ~Gombrich 1996). 7 Jane Bunnag has, for example, shown that many monks in present-day Thailand prefer studies over meditation. Studies are more provable and concrete, and they are also more easily assessed in terms of academic degrees and certificates. Meditation on the other hand is looked upon with skepticism by many monks and regarded as the domain of nuns, magicians and ~ilgrims (Bunnag 1984: 165). 8 There is a historical and pragmatic explanation of the monks' tendency to focus on studies and learning. When the Buddha had passed away it was important to remember, preserve and maintain his teachings. The monks could no longer rely upon an enlightened master but had to take refi1ge in his teachings, so the teachings had to be memorized and written down. This process required specialized learned monks who devoted all their time and energy to this difficult task. 9\"'' Geoffrey Samuel has made a somewhat similar division between what he calls \"clerical\" and \"shamanic\" Buddhism (Samuel 1993: 3-23, 56~-573). Samuel's categories, though d~signed for Tibetan Buddhism, resemble the division between forest and village monks in several ways. 179"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"very offensive and definitely transgressive.910 We here thus find an old con-nection between the practices of the mad Tibetan yogins and the early Indian Buddhists. Mahayana Buddhism One of the important developments of Mahayana Buddhism was to shift the ideal from the figure of the arhanl to the bodhisattva. Another important doctrinal development, which had a profound effect upon Buddhist practice, was to stress the empty (sunya) nature of all phenomena. Both these charac-teristic elements of Mahayana Buddhism are important to be aware of when studying the mad yogins of Tibet, and can help us to come to terms with their odd behavior. Let us start with the bodhisattva ideal; the bodhisattva was a \"buddha to-be, and a bodhisattva had to perform what appear to be rather extreme acts of selflessness. For example, a bodhisattva had to be able to give away eve-rything, even his own body if necessary. Many of the stories ofbodhisattvas show how they act completely without self interest. The famous story of prince Visvantara (Pali: Vessantara) shows how the Buddha, in this particu-lar previous life, did not hesitate to give away everything he had, even his wife and children, if someone asked for them. In another previous life, the Buddha offered his own body to a starving tigress and her cubs out of com-passion, thereby saving the lives of the tigers by sacrificing his body. These kinds of actions do indeed differ radically from the way in which ordinary persons with attachment to their bodies and belongings act. Such \"extreme, altruistic acts, whether performed in actuality, or contemplated about as an ideal, could very well appear mad in the eyes of people who do not share the bodhisattva's notion of egolessness. A bodhisattva should also be prepared to ignore Buddhist rules and regu-lations if necessary. There are several examples of how the priitimok~a vows (so sor thar pa 'i sdom pa, \"individual liberation vows,) could sometimes be a hindrance for a bodhisattva in his or her attempts to help other beings. Thus we are told that a bodhisattva once killed a murderer-to-be before he had committed his crime. This he did to save the life of five hundred people who were about to be killed, and at the same time to save the murderer-to-be from having to be reborn in hell as a consequence of the negative act of kill-ing. The bodhisattva did not care if the negative act of killing a human being would cause him future suffering. Instead he was solely concerned about the well-being of others. Since he had no egoistic motivation when he performed the negative act, he earned a huge amount of merit, we are told in the sto-ry.91l 910 Schopen 2007: 64. 911 The story is cited in, for example, Patrul Rinpoche 1994: 125. 180"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The other notion which became of particular importance in the Mahayana tradition was \"emptiness\"-sunyata. This idea is connected with the com-passionate and selfless nature of the bodhisattva. According to the Mahayana teachings it is, in fact, this realization of the empty nature of the self and all phenomena that enables the bodhisattva to give away everything and act without any self-concern. The bodhisattva has realized that no self exists, and s/he therefore has no attachment and perceives things in a completely non-dualistic way. This enables the bodhisattva to act in a truly altruistic manner, which is very different from the way in which ordinary beings acts. The doctrine of emptiness holds that all phenomena, seen fi-om an abso-lute perspective, are neither pure nor impure, but empty. This idea gives rise to what, seen fi-om the perspective of the older Buddhist schools, appears to be rather radical, even shocking, innovations. The doctrine of emptiness is clearly formulated in the Heart Sutra: ( ... ] Form is empty; emptiness is form. Emptiness is not other than form; form is not other than emptiness. In the same way, feeling, discrimination, conditioning factors, and consciousnesses are empty. ( ... ] [A]ll phenomena are empty, without characteristic, unproduced, unceased, stainless, not stain-less, undiminished, unfilled. [ ... ] Therefore ( ... ] in emptiness there is no form, no feeling[ ... ] no ignorance, no extinction of ignorance, no aging and death[ ... ]. In the same way, no suffering, origin, cessation, path, no wisdom, no attainment, no nonattainment.912 The Indian master Nagarjuna, who is considered to be the founder of the madhyamaka philosophical system of Mahayana Buddhism, was perhaps the most important propagator of these ideas, and his influence upon Tibetan Buddhism was huge. According to Nagarjuna and his madhyamaka philoso-phical system, samsara and nirvana are not different entities, but share the same fundamental characteristic, namely emptiness. This entails that in the eyes of a realized master, samsara is nirvana. John Ardussi asserts that the philosophical position of the madhyamika, developed by Nagarjuna in India underlies the behavior of the mad yogins ofTibet.913 This does not mean that the mad yogins necessarily were expert madhyamikas, however, but merely that the madhyamaka philosophy facilitates a non-dual and transgressive behavior. The Tibetan mad yogins could thus claim that their realization of the empty nature of all phenomena was demonstrated by their acting in mad ways. Another important Mahayana term which is used when adopting uncon-ventional or new ways of practice is \"method\" (upaya).914 A bodhisattva could, and should, apply various methods to help others. If necessary, he (or '112 Lopez 1996: vii.

T antric Practice Contrary to the way in which the early Buddhists and also the bodhisattvas are generally presented, gTsang smyon sometimes acted in a very outrageous and seemingly crazy way. This type of extreme or radical asceticism is not common among early Buddhists, but it is found among some of the tantric Buddhist masters. gTsang smyon and his disciples referred to the Buddhist siddhas and to tantric Buddhist practices when his unusual way of behaving was questioned. The most important and relevant place to look when analyz-ing and contextualizing gTsang smyon and his way of practising Buddhism is therefore Tantric Buddhism to which we now will tum. Tantric Buddhism is also sometimes called Vajrayana (Adamantine Vehi-cle) or Mantrayana (Mantra Vehicle) and although it had the same basic doctrinal foundation as the Mahayana tradition, it differed rather raqically in terms of its methodology. Especially the higher or later forms of tantric prac-tices (i.e. Mahayogatantra and Yoginftantra) prescribed methods of a trans-gressive, antinomian and sometimes seemingly mad character.915 According to tantric exegesis the tantric practices are much more efficient than the \"siitric\" ones and at a rather early date a differentiation between the gradual and long \"Way of the Perfections\" (ptiramittinaya) and the direct and short \"Way of Mantras\" (mantranaya) was made within the Mahayana tradition. The latter path is considered more advanced and potentially dangerous, and as the term shows, the use of mantras is especially important in it. By fol-lowing the path of mantra (i.e. !antra) it is possible to reach the goal-enlightenment-within a single lifetime according to tantric exegetes. De-spite methodological differences, Tantric Buddhism is thus considered to be a part of the Mahayana tradition. The central practice in Tantric Buddhism is the stidhana (or stidhanti) practice.916 This is a ritual practice centered on a tantric deity (i~[adevatti, yi 915 There are different ways of classifying the tantras and I am using a fivefold system in this section: Kriyiitantra, Caryiitantra, Yogatantra, Mahiiyogatantra and Yoginitantra. This clas-sification is broadly chronological, and it was developed within the Indian tantric tradition itself. According to the tantric exegetes, the five-fold system represents a gradual develop-ment, from lower or more basic tantras to higher or more advanced ones. The newer schools of Tibetan Buddhism (gsar rna) usually use a four-fold classification system: Kriyiitantra (bya rgyud), Cmyiitantra (spyod rgyud), Yogatantra (rna/'byor rgyud), and Anuttarayogatantra (mal 'byor bla na rned pa rgyud). Anuttarayogatantra is in tum sub-divided into \"mother tantras\" (rna rgyud) and \"father tantras\" (pha rgyud), the former term refers to Yoginitantra while the latter refers to Mahiiyogatantra. 916 \"Means of accomplishment\" (gnth thabs). 182"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"dam)911 which the yogin evokes by means of visualizations and mantra reci-tations. While this technique is also found in Hinduism, the setting in which it is employed is not. The ritual starts with taking refuge to the Triple Gem (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) and generating an altruistic mind (bodhi-citta). Moreover, both before and after the visualizations and mantra recita-tions are performed, the practitioner should ritually evoke the state of empti-ness (siinyatti). The setting thus situates the ritual within a basic Buddhist and Mahayanist ethical and doctrinal context.918 The siidhana practice is divided into two phases, the \"generation phase\" (utpattikrama, bskyed rim) and the \"completion phase\" (ni§panna-krama/saf!1pannakrama, rdzogs rim).919 During the first phase (the generation phase), the practitioner visualizes the yidam and his ma~9,ala. The sadhanas could be more or less elaborate, from short texts which take only a couple of minutes to read, to elaborate texts which take several hours to read. The vi-sualizations follow a similar pattern in different sadhanas, but depending on the length of the texts and the type of tantra (i.e. Kriytitantra, Caryiltantra, Yogatantra, Mahtiyogatantra, Yoginftantra) variations occur. Generally, the generation phase consists of the following scenario: Out of emptiness a seed syllable emerges and from it the deity is created. The deity is thereafter de-scribed in some detail: its color, number of arms, ornaments, bodily position, surroundings, entourage (its mai_lqala), and so forth. Then, worship and of-ferings (piijil) are performed towards the visualized deity. Depending on the text, one either visualizes the deity in front of oneself (mdun bskyed), or in the vase at the altar (bum bskyed) or one visualizes oneself as the deity (bdag bskyed). These various ways of visualizing the deity are sometimes per-formed in succession in more elaborate rituals, but in shorter sadhanas the focus is upon one of them The deity that is being visualized (or created if you will) in the mind of the practitioner is called \"conventional being\" (sa-mayasattva, dam tshig sems pa/dpa). This mentally created deity is then 917 Contrary to prior practice, I will render Sanskrit before Tibetan in the parentheses and footnotes in these sections, since they are mainly indological. Although these sections deal with lndic material, I will include Tibetan words in parentheses rather frequently, sometimes without giving Sanskrit equivalents. The reason for this is that these indological sections are necessary background material for a subsequent discussion about how these practices were used by gTsang smyon and the other mad yo gins of Tibet. 918 Compare with Williams (with Anthony Tribe) 2003: 229. 919 What follows is a very abbreviated and simplified description of the sadhana practice within Tantric Buddhism. For a detailed study ofsadhana rituals, see Beyer 1973. Some other accounts are found in: Bokar 1991 and 1999; Cozart 1996; Kongtrul 2002; Lopez 2002: 224-· 227; Williams (with Anthony Tribe) 2003: 223-231. It should be kept in mind that practical information about how Buddhist sadhana practice is performed generally stems from the Tibetan tradition where this type of practice is still considered very important Many Tibetan lamas, both of earlier and more recent times, have commented upon these practices. Although some Indian commentaries are extant, Tibetan translations and commentaries written by Tibetan lamas have informed and dominated the way in which tantric Buddhist practice is conceived in the West and elsewhere. 183"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"ritually transformed into the actual deity, the \"wisdom being\" (jiianasattva, ye shes sems paldpa '). When this occurs the deity is actually present, or as Anthony Tribe describes it, \"at that point the sadhaka becomes the deity\" (if it is a self-visualization), or the deity \"really appears\" (if it is a visualization in front of oneself).920 An important and often dominating part of the ritual, at least when it is performed as a meditation practice, is mantra recitation.921 Each deity has its own mantra and the same deity often has several different mantras associated with its different aspects. These mantras fulfil specific functions when re-cited, and they are believed to possess certain powers. To recite the mantra in combination with the accompanying visualization is to activate this innate power, which in tum is associated with the meditation deity (yidam). Hence, compassion is believed to be generated and spread by the recitation of the mantra of A valokitesvara (the Bodhisattva of Compassion)-OI?z mar:zi-padme hiil?z-for example. Having visualized the deity and recited its mantra, the next of the two phases occurs-the \"completion phase\". During the \"completion phase\" the notion of being separated from the deity disappears, and the deity-as an expression of enlightenment-and the practitioner's own mind are no longer perceived as separate entities. Also this phase of the siidhana practice can be sub-divided into several parts, the two main ones being: the \"completion phase with signs\"922 and the \"completion phase without signs\".923 The \"completion phase with signs\" consists of several yogic practices that involve manipulating the subtle energies (priiiJ.a) or winds (vayu, rlung) that are believed to circulate in channels (na(il, rtsa) in the subtle body, thought to underlie the gross physical body of the practitioner. There are three main channels and several minor ones in which these winds circulate, and the channels are wrapped around the central channel (avadhiiti, dbu rna) at sev-eral points of constriction called wheels (cakra, 'khor lo). There are also subtle essences called drops (hindu, thig /e) which are yogically manipu-lated. These types of yogic practices are termed \"with signs\" because the practitioner continues to visualize him or herself as a deity while doing them. According to the yogic teachings, the winds serve as a vehicle for the mind, 920 Williams (with Anthony Tribe) 2003: 230. . . . 921 Sadhanas are often carried out as regular, communal ntuals, and when th1s IS the case mantra recitation ofien constitutes a rather small part of the overall ritual (i.e. only a sn:'all numbers of mantras are performed, perhaps one hundred eight}. When performed as a medita-tion practice (in retreat or during a practitioner's daily personal practice) the mantras are counted, and a large number of mantras are recited during each meditation sess1on. Sever~! such sessions could be carried out everyday, and it can take months, even years, until a certam practice is completed (i.e. the required number of mantras for the particular practice, perhaps a hundred thousand or a million mantras, have been rec1ted). 922 mTshan bcas rdzogs rim. . . . . 923 mTshan med rdzogs rim.

This gives rise to falsely distinguishing between subject and object, which in tum leads to defiled mental states (klesa) and negative actions (karma). Through yogic practices, the winds can be brought into the central channel and transformed into wisdom.924 The most famous system involving these kinds of advanced yogic prac-tices is the Six Dharmas of Naropa: \"fierce goddess\" (caf}rj.iill, gtum mo), \"illusory body\" (mayakaya, sgyu Ius), \"dream\" (svapna, rmi lam), \"clear light\" (prabhiisvara, 'od gsa!), transference (satrzkranti, :pho ba) and \"in-termediate state\" (antarabhava, bar do), which, according to tradition, Naropa received from Tilopa.925 During the completion phase without signs no more visualizations or reci-tations take place. Instead the yogin \"remains in a blissfully radiant and awakened but formless state. '\"~26 The completion phase without signs refers to non-dual practices aimed at directly realizing or perceiving the nature of the mind. There are different practices of this type; the newer schools of Tibetan Buddhism (gsar rna) often refer to them as the \"Great Seal\" (Mahiimudra, phyag rgya chen po) while the earlier school of Tibetan Bud-dhism (rNying rna) refers to them as Atiyoga or \"Great Completion\" (rdzogs pa chen po).927 While the latter term is unique to the rNying rna and Bon schools,92K Mahamudra is a very common and important tetm widely used in later Indian tantrism. Mahamudra became especially important in the bKa' brgyud tradition to which gTsang smyon belonged. To be allowed and able to practise a tantric sadhana and the advanced yo-gic practices associated with the completion phase, the practitioner has to receive \"empowerment\" or \"consecration\" (abhi~eka, dbang) and instruc-tions from a guru. The empowerment ceremony was originally modeled upon the coronation ritual of kingship and consisted of a number of consec-ratory moments.929 Eventually a fourfold series of empowerments was devel-oped in which the earlier types of empowennents were combined into a sin-gle empowerment known as \"vase empowerment\" (kalasabhi~eka, bum dbang). In addition to this, three other types of empowerments were added: 924 Nalandii Translation Committee 1986: 235, Lopez 2002: 215, Williams (with Anthony Tribe) 2003: 200, 230. 925 To describe these advanced yogic practices in detail is beyond the scope of the present study. Guenther has described the Six Dharmas of N iiropa at some length (Guenther 1986: 131-249). 926 Williams (with Anthony Tribe) 2003: 2 31. 927 It should be noted that these two terms have a very broad meaning and may be used to describe many different things. However, among the bKa' brgyud par Mahiimudrii is often used for the completion stage practice without signs. Concerning the term atiyoga or mahclsandhi, as it is also sometimes called, it seem to be a later translation of Tibetan rdzogs ~: chen po, and as far as 1 know is not attested in Indian texts. 28 See, for example, Dalton 2003: 730. 92'1 Davidson 2002: 123-127. 185"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"\"secret empowerment\" (guhyabhi~eka, gsang dbang), \"wisdom empower-ment\" (prajflajnantibhi~eka, shes rab ye shes kyi dbang) and \"fourth em-powerment\" (caturthtibhi~eka, dbang bzhi pa).930 These empowerments had the function of introducing the tantric practitioner to the meditation-deity which he would visualize and ritually evoke in his sadhana practice. The last three empowerments were taken from the Yoginitantras and both the secret empowerment and wisdom empowerment have an explicitly sexual content according to the tantric exegetical literature.931 Another common and important tantric practice is the tantric feast (ga'!acakra, tshogs kyi 'khor lo/tshogs 'khor), which is performed on a regu-lar basis by tantric practitioners. Its purpose is to purify transgressions of tantric commitments (samaya, dam tshig) and celebrate the phenomenal world. During a ga~zacakra, desire and sense perceptions are made part of the path.932 Music, food and drink are offered and the food and drink are then consumed by the participants. Tribe mentions that these ritual gatherings \"can be seen to particularly focus on the impure and forbidden.'>933 The un-derlying idea of the ga~wcakra gatherings was that the ritual consumption of what was considered impure and forbidden could help the participant to ap-proach a non-dual state of mind.934 The Yoginltantras became an accepted part of Indian Buddhist monastic institutions in the ninth century and the transgressive and antinomian ele-ments contained in them were interpreted in a symbolic way. Sexual prac-tices and the ritual consumption of impure substances were not carried out, but only visualized. This made it possible for monks and nuns to practice the tantric sadhanas, receive and bestow abhi~ekas (empowerments) and partici-pate in gal)acakras (tantric feasts) without violating their monastic vows. A large commentarial literature developed which helped to integrate the con-troversial elements found in the Mahayogatantras and Yoginitantras into a Mahayana Buddhistic context. However, despite the attempts to domesticate Tantric Buddhism, the mere existence of antinomian and transgressive ele-ments within it posed a problem. If taken literally, Tantric Buddhism made it possible to justify transgressive and antinomian behavior, sometimes of a violent and sexual nature. As seen in the life stories of gTsang smyon, it 93° For a short description of these empowerments, see Williams (with Anthony Tribe) 2003: 231-235. 931 For a description of them, see, for example, Snellgrove 2002: 243-277. 932 Nalanda Translation Committee 1986: 224. 933 Williams (with Anthony Tribe) 2003: 236. 934 Williams (with Anthony Tribe) 2003: 236. See also David Snellgrove's description of the gal}acakra, Snellgrove 2002: 160-1 70. It should be noted that the transgressive elements of the gal)acakra are more or less absent from the ritual nowadays (i.e. non-alcoholic beverages are used instead of alcohol) and this mere symbolic transgression was probably the normal way of performing gat:zacakras in former times also, at least among the so-called domesti· cated tantric practitioners. 186"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"seems that he practised Tantric Buddhism more literally than others. What the monks only visualized, gTsang smyon sometimes acted out. The Heruka Among the different tantric deities belonging to the Yoginitantras, the most important ones are probably Cakrasaqwara (Saqwara) and Hevajra.935 These two deities were central to both the late tantric Buddhists of India and also their Tibetan heirs. There are many tantric texts, commentaries, sadhanas, empowerment rituals and so forth associated with these two deities, and they both have several manifestations. Cakrasaqwara and Hevajra belong to a specific category of tantric deities called herukas. A heruka is a wrathful manifestation of enlightenment who is generally depicted standing erect, surrounded by fire, and adorned with bone ornaments and various other artifacts taken from a charnel ground, such as human heads, blood and intestines. The heruka is often depicted sexually embracing a wild tantric goddess (i.e. t/.tikinl or yogini), and also surrounded by a group of such goddesses. The overall picture of the heruka is thus far removed from that of a buddha or bodhisattva, and even from that of a tan-tric deity of the older or basic classes of tantras (i.e. Kriyiitantra, Caryti-tantra, Yogatantra). Instead, the heruka resembles Siva in his more destruc-tive manifestation, such as Bhairava and Rudra.936 The relationship between Siva and the heruka is complex. There are several origination myths of the Heruka which explain how he appeared in the world and why. These myths of origination also explain the relationship between the Heruka and Siva. According to these Buddhist myths, a heruka is a manifestation of a buddha disguised as a fierce charnel-ground deity as a means to benefit the world in times of great difficulty.937 As pa11 of this mission, in the words of David B. Gray, the Heruka takes \"on the appearance of Bhairava and his host as a compassionate strategy (upiiya) for the conversion of their followers.\"938 The origin myth of the Heruka thus \"represents the adoption of non-Buddhist elements while at the same time representing the subordination of these ele-ments within a Buddhist cosmic hierarchy.\"939 This is illustrated graphically by the placement of the Saiva deities under the feet of their Buddhist van-quisher (i.e. the Heruka). 935 Several studies and translations of Cakrasa,.vara Tantra and Hevajra Tanlra have been carried out, see for example Gray 2007, Tsuda 1973 (Cakrasa,.vara Tantra); Farrow and Menon 1992, Snellgrove 1959 (Hevajra Tantra). · 936 Gray 2007: 43. 937 Gray 2007: 40.

As a manifestation of enlightenment the he-ruka was ultimately seen as representing the inner potential of the practitio-ner and, as mentioned above, the goal of the tantric practices was to realize one's own mind as being identical with the meditation deity. The Siddha The Yoginitantras not only presented new and radically different methods of Buddhist practice, but also a new type of Buddhist saint: the siddha (accom-plished one, gntb thob). The siddhas of Vajrayana Buddhism were active in India from the eight to the twelfth centuries, and they taught a form of Bud-dhism that, in spirit, doctrine, and practice, defied and challenged the tradi-tional, monastically oriented Buddhist institutions.940 As the name shows, a siddha was believed to possess two types of siddhi (accomplishment, dngos gn1b), namely \"supramundane accomplishment\" (lokottarasiddhi, mchog gi dngos grub) and \"mundane accomplishments\" (laukikasiddhi, thun mong gi dngos grub).941 While the former term refers to awakening, the latter refers to miraculous powers such as the ability to fly, the ability to become invisible, the ability to travel under ground, and so forth. It is the supramundane ac-complishment which is the real aim of Buddhist practice, but since it is in-visible it is difficult to display to others. The mundane accomplishments, on the other hand, are seen as external signs of having accomplished the com-pletion phase practices942 and could be demonstrated if necessary. The siddhas often traveled freely across social, geographical and religious borders. Gray describes them as a liminal group of renunciant yogins and yoginis who constituted what might be called the \"siddha movement.'\"143 The siddha movement, both Hindu and Buddhist, appears to have originated in a distinct subculture which could be termed \"the cult of the charnel ground\".944 The siddhas seem to have been a motley and colorful crowd, and it is very hard to define a siddha in terms of his (or occasionally her) social class, oc-cupation and religious affiliation. In Abhayadatta's famous account of eigh-ty-four short siddha life stories we find the most variegated types of peo-ple.945 Among the masters depicted in the text there are a hunter, a liar, a 940 Wallis 2003: 3. 941 It should be noted that the Tibetan terms mean \"supreme accomplishment\" and \"ordinary accomplishment\", respectively. It is noteworthy that this division between worldy and other-worldy attainments is an old one in Buddhism. 942 Rigzin I 997: I 21. 943 Gray 2007: 7. 944 Gray 2007: 7. 945 Translated into English in Dowman 1985 and Robinson I 979. 188"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"senile weaver, a thief, a gambler, a king, a monk, an alchemist, a bird catch-er, a pearl diver, a musician, a housewife and a potter, to just mention a few examples.946 Many of these people thus lived their lives in ways which were difficult or impossible to combine with traditional Buddhist values. One of the characteristic features of Tantric Buddhism was that it offered people whom traditional Buddhism could not help a path to salvation. Since the tantric methods could be practised without necessarily having to give up one's life-style/occupation, however unsuitable it might seem, even prosti-tutes, thieves, and hunters could practice Buddhism and become siddhas. As mentioned earlier, the siddhas often communicated their inner experiences by means of tantric songs. A noteworthy aspect of their message, which is sometimes reflected in the siddha songs, was a sharp critique of the estab-lished religions. Shashibhusan Dasgupta has stated that salient features of their teachings are \"a spirit of protest and criticism\", \"an aversion to recon-dite scholarship\", and \"a scathing criticism of the formalities of life andre-ligion\".947 Since the siddhas were so different from one another it is difficult to de-scribe their general characteristics. It is, however, striking that many of the siddhas behaved unusually and sometimes resembled madmen. Anthony Tribe remarks that many of the siddhas were non-monastics and non-celibates who lived on the margins of society, frequenting charnel grounds and generally behaving in an unconventional manner.948 Similarly, James B. Robinson states that \"siddhas at times exhibited very unconventional behav-ior.\"949 So if there is any specific characteristic feature of the siddhas it would probably be their unconventionality. Abhayadatta's collection of life stories is a good example of how the siddhas are often depicted as highly unconventional individuals. The siddha Kalapa, for example, started acting according to \"spontaneous behavior\" (/hug pa'i spyod pa) after he had \"dissolved the dualistic idea of self and other\" (bdag gzhan gnyis su dmigs pa stor).95° Kalapa's unusual way of act-ing caused the people who saw him to call him a crazy man (smyon pa 946 For more examples, see the table of contents in Dowman's English translation of Abha-~adatta's text (Dowman 1985). 7 Dasgupta 1962: 51--QI. It should be noticed that Dasgupta designates the siddhas saha-jiyas.

Suffering, they are pitiful in their torment, which from the beginning, has no reality. Appearances are inseparable from emptiness; the pure light is continually present. And though you act like a crazy man, you will enter into the pure city. 952 The female siddha, Lak~minkara, pretended to be insane (smyo 'rdzun byed) when she discovered that she had been given in marriage to a non-Buddhist prince of Lanka. Utterly disgusted and shocked when seeing the cruel behav-ior of the entourage of her new husband, she fainted. After she recovered from her faint, she gave her wealth to the citizens of the city and her ornaments to her retinue. [ ... ] She cut her hair and stripped her-self naked; then she smeared ashes and coal on her body. Although she acted demented, she unwaveringly set about her heart's aim. [ ... t53 Thinking that the princess had become truly (i.e. pathologically) mad, every-one at the court became worried and sad. Doctors were sent for, and medi-cines prepared, but Lak~minkara refused to accept any treatment. Eventually, she managed to escape; full of revulsion for samsara she acted like a \"de-mented ascetic\" (smyon ma 'i brtul zhugs). From that point on she stayed at charnel grounds, and after seven years she attained accomplishments (siddhi) and became a siddha. 954 The mad yogins of Tibet were often classified as siddhas (grub thob) and they often looked and acted very similarly to the way in which the Indian siddhas acted. The mad yogins of Tibet and the Indian siddhas practised the same tantric rituals, had the same yidams, and recited the same mantras. Some of these practices prescribe a particular behavior as part of the prac-tice, and it is to this behavior and to other practices and notions related to madness and unconventionality in Tantric Buddhism, that we now will tum. 951 Robinson 1979: Ill.

These terms are mainly found in texts belonging to the Mahayoga and the Yogin! class oftantras, such as Guhyasamaja, Hevajra and Cakrasmf1vara Tantra. An important term which is related to the unconventional and sometimes seemingly crazy behavior of the siddhas is samarasa (\"equal taste\", ro mnyam). In the Hevajra Tantra it is said that there is no sense of duality in the ultimate state of sahaja.955 In such a state everything-whether the low-est, or the middle or the best-should be realized as being the same.956 The practical implication of this is the realization that there is no ultimate differ-ence between what is usually regarded as desirable and what is usually re-garded as undesirable. A siddha should therefore ideally be able to drink alcohol without developing a craving for it, as well as urine without feeling any disgust. Since he or she has gotten rid of conceptual thinking and abides in non-dual cognition, everything has the same taste (samarasa). The Heva-jra Tantra explains how a tantric practitioner should act: \"Enjoying food and drink he should take it as it comes, making no distinction between that which is liked or disliked, eatable or uneatable, drinkable or undrinkable. Nor should he ever wonder whether a thing is suitable or unsuitable.\"957 Yet another notion which is related to unconventional practices is the pa-radoxical practice of reversal (viparftabhiivanii, z/og pa 'i sgom pa). Accord-ing to tantric practice it is possible to be liberated by the very same thing that usually entangles beings in samsara. This \"homeopathic\" practice is de-scribed in the Hevajra Tantra as follows: With the very poison, a little of which would kill any other being, a man who understands poison would dispel another poison. Just as a man who suffers with flatulence is given beans to eat, so that wind may overcome wind in the way of a homeopathic cure, so existence is purified by existence in the coun-tering of discursive thought by its own kind.[ ... ] Those things by which men of evil conduct are bound, others tum into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by the heretical buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.958 It is quite reasonable to assume that a person who deliberately acted in a manner contradictory to normative Buddhism and experienced, or at least tried to experience, everything as equal, could be regarded as mad. 955 For a more detailed description and analysis of sahaja (\"innate\", /han cig 111 skyespa) see fs~a~me 1975 and 1977; Dasgupta 1962.

Thus he wanders around like a demon, through contemplation on his personal divinity.\"960 The yogin is thus encouraged to act like a madman and in the twenty-fourth verse of the sixth chapter of Guhyasiddhi another important term is given, namely \"the observance of madness\" (unmattavrata, smyon pa 'i brtul zhugs).961 This particular observance is also mentioned in other tantric texts and the Sal!zvarodaya Tantra (dPa/ bde mchog sdom pa 'byung ba), which is an explanatory tantra of the Cakrasarpvara, similarly describes how the yogin at an advanced stage of his practice should practise the \"observance of madness\" (unmattavrata).962 The observance of madness is also described in Maitripa's (=Advaya-vajra, ca. 1007-1085) Tattvadasaka (Ten Verses on Reality). Glenn Wallis translates the passage as follows: \"deviating from worldly norms, he depends on this vow of the madman [unmattavrata]. He does everything free from supports, adorned with his own basis of power.\"963 That the observance of madness was regarded as important by some of the later Indian tantric exe-getes is proven by the fact that Maittipa-who happens to be a key figure in the Mahamudra lineage of the bKa' brgyud tradition to which gTsang smyon belonged---discusses it in his Kudr~{inirghiitana (Uprooting of False Views). In this text, Maitripa attempts to integrate the controversial siddha-oriented elements, which are epitomized in the mad observance, with main-stream Buddhism. Maitripa's strategy for doing this is to say that also those who abide by the observance of madness should follow the basic or prelimi-nary Buddhist practices (iidikarma).964 ~ Secret Accomplishment, gSang ba grub pa.

Similarly, the above-quoted section about unmattavrata from Sarrzvarodaya Tantra is taken from the chapter which explains the conduct (carya). The Sanskrit word carya is one of the most important and commonly used terms in connection with madness as a tantric practice.965 Cmya, or spyod pa as the Tibetans translated the term, is sometimes presented as a part of the triad: \"view\" (dr.Hi, Ita ba), \"meditation\" (bhavana, sgom pa) and \"conduct\" (carya, spyod pa). The latter term could be translated in different ways, and it is often translated as \"practice\", \"action\", \"conduct\" and \"behavior\". Carya thus deals with how a practitioner should behave, and generally refers to a disciplined way of acting and behaving. What is regarded as disciplined or proper conduct in the tantras is not necessarily regarded as such in the satras, however, and the prescribed conduct also differs within the different classes of tantra. The Tibetans sometimes use the expression \"enter into the conduct\" (spyod pa Ia 'jug palgshegs pa) to denote a stage in tantric practice when the practitioner starts to behave in a certain way and interacts more directly with the world According to Toni Huber, carya is a form of wan-dering asceticism that takes place during the completion phase of tantric practice.966 In many tantras a specific chapter is devoted to conduct. As seen above, it was often to the catya chapter of Hevajra Tantra that gTsang smyon himself referred when his strange and bizarre ways were ques-tioned.967 In this particular chapter it is stated that when the yogin gains final-ity of his perfection in Hevajra he must: \"wear the sacred ear-rings, and the circlet on his head; on his wrists the bracelets, and the girdle round his waist, rings around his ankles, bangles round his arms; he wears the bone-necklace and for his dress a tiger-skin, and his food must be the five ambrosias.\"96& In addition to wearing these rather spectacular garments, the yogin should arrange his piled-up hair as a crest and secure shards of skulls to the crest. He should besmear his body with ashes, wear a sacred thread of hair, and 965 It is important not to confuse the tantric class called Cmyiitantra with the more general use of carya. Carya is a very common Sanskrit term and its use depends on the context. In Mahayana is is often used together with bod hi, thus we have bodhicaryii \"enlightened con-duct\" Cmya is important in all the tantric classes and the discussions that follow mainly concern how the term is understood in the Mahayogatantra and Yoginftantra classes. 966 Huber 2000: 9. 967 This chapter is translated in Snellgrove 1959: 63-72. gTsang smyon ref erred to this chap-ter on several occasions, see for example G: 32-33. 96\" Snellgrove 1959: 63. The five ambrosias (pa~lcilm!{a) are: feces, urine, blood, human flesh, and white and red regenerative substances. There are several variations of this list, and the five substances it contains are generally regarded as having a symbolic rather than literal meaning. 193"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"carry a tantric staff (kha{viiitga), a small hand-drum (~/amant) and a skull-cup (kapiila}.969 Moreover it is stated that \"Meditation is good if performed at night be-neath a lonely tree or in a cemetary, or in the mother's house,970 or in some unfrequented spot.\"971 When it comes to behavior the tantra encoura~es the yogin to find himself a consort, sing and dance and to \"abandon desue and d f h \"972 folly, fear and anger, an any sense o s arne. Vratacarya Another key term that we have already encountered, which is used in the Buddhist tantras in connection with unconventional ways of practice, is vra-ta (observance, vow}.973 Vrata is a common and general term which is often used in Indian religions and, like cmyii, it is only in specific instances that it denotes a mad or unconventional way of acting. The Tibetans translated vrata with the term brtul zlntgs, and this Tibetan term is often encountered in reference to the seemingly crazy practices of the Tibetan mad yogins. The compound brtul zlmgs spyod pa which translates the Sanskrit vrataCGlJ•ii is particularly common. The literal meaning of this term is \"conduct\" (spyod pa) of \"taming\" (brtul) and \"entering\" (zhugs}.974 According to sDe gzhung Rin po che ( 1906-1987) the meaning of this technical term is \"overcoming worldly conduct and entering into the conduct of the 8 uddhas. Or else, tam-ing bad behavior and entering into perfect conduct.\"975 Like vrata, vrata-cmyii is difficult to translate into English, and I have translated the com-pound as \"disciplined conduct\".976 Cyrus Stearns mentions that \"the original range of meaning for this expression is extremely wide, sometimes denoting any type of religious behavior in general and at other times indicating a spe-cific disciplined style.\"977 Since most of the descriptions concerning how and 969 Snellgrove (trans.) 1959: 65.

It is, however important to be aware of the fact that the Tibetans based their exegesis upon Sanskrit texts, and a brief account of what is said about vratacaryii in one of these texts will therefore first be provided. The vratacaryii practice is explained in Aryadeva's Caryiimeliipaka-pradipa,918 which is one of the most systematic treatments of the advanced yogic techniques of the tantras of the Mahayoga class. According to Caryii-meliipakapradi'pa, vratacaryii is a very advanced practice which should only be carried out by a yogin who is indifferent to his own body and life and also has reached a determination that he now needs to perfect the result of his practice in this very life.979 Vratacaryii, is referred to as a non-dual practice, and Aryadeva explains that it is impossible to get rid of the vestiges of be-ginningless defilements without this practice.980 A practitioner who practices vrataca~yii must also disregard the \"eight worldly concerns\" (a~[aloka­dharma), namely: gain (liibha), loss (aliibha), fame (yasas), obscurity (ayasas), slander (nindii), praise (prasaf!1sii), pleasure (sukha) and pain (dul}kha).981 In relation to vratacaryii, Aryadeva distinguishes between practices with elaboration,982 without elaboration,983 and completely without elaboration.984 The latter category contains practices such as the observance of madness and the bhusuku-conduct (bhusukuca~yii). The bhusuku-conduct refers to the fact that a yogin at this stage of practice, apart from eating (bhu), sleeping (su) and defecating (ku), only meditates on emptiness.985 Tibetan Explanations of \"Disciplined Conduct\" The Tibetan masters and scholars who wrote about conduct and disciplined conduce86 based their expositions upon Indian tantric texts such as Hevajra Tantra,981 Cakrasaf{lvara Tantra,988 Guhyasiddhi, Guhyasamiija,989 Sam-978 The Lamp that Integrates the Practices. 979 Wedemeyer (trans.) 2007: 277-278. 980 Wedemeyer (trans.) 2007: 279-280. 981 Wedemeyer (trans.) 2007: 281. 982 Prapancacaryii, spros bcas. 983 Ni~prapaiicacatyli, spros med. 984 Atyantani~prapaiicacaryii, shin tu spros med.

Although the Tibetan commentators belonged to different Buddhist traditions and lived in different time periods their presentations are remarkably similar, and they often use the same technical terms. There are some minor variations in their respective explanations, however, and it is therefore useful to compare them with one another. Like the Indian texts upon which they based their explanations, the Tibet-ans attempt to situate the transgressive, and at times, seemingly mad forms of conduct described in the Indian tantric texts within a \"normative\" Bud-dhist context. They point out that these types of conduct should only be car-ried out by tantric practitioners who have reached a stable meditative con-centration by means of much prior practice in the generation and completion phases oftantric sadhana meditation, and they all emphasize that much prior training in non-tantric (siitric) Buddhism is a necessary foundation for tantric practice. One of several key terms they use is \"disciplined conduct with a consort\" (vidytivrata, rig pa 'i brtul zhugs),994 which ICe sgom Shes rab rdo rje (ICe sgom, ca. 1140/50-1220) describes as a type of post-meditation practice (rjes thob) that should be carried out only by practitioners who have attained inner experience.995 According to ICe sgom \"disciplined conduct with a con-sort\" is done for the sake of enhancing a meditative experience and there are three ways of performing this post-meditation practice.996 Like Aryadeva, he distinguishes between practices with, without, and completely without elabo-ration, and it is the characteristics of the practitioner that determine how this practice should be carried out.997 As a result of the practice, the practitioner 99° For a Study of the first chapter, see Skorupski 1996. 991 Equalizing Buddhahood, Sangs rgyas mnyam sbyor. 992 For an English translation, see Wedemeyer 2007. 993 'Jam mgon kong sprul blo gros mtha · yas makes an interesting enumeration of the Indian sources for vratacmyii and other similar practices (2002: 936). 994 This term is also hard to translate. For example, Bentor translates it as \"taming the en-gagement of awareness\" (Bentor 200 I: 335) and Davidson translates it as \"discipline with a consort\" (Davidson 2002: 326). How one chooses to translate the term has to do with whether one understands vidyti (rig pa) as meaning \"awareness\" or \"consort\". The explanatory texts of this practice make the latter option plausible. It should, however, be kept in mind that the practice referred to encompasses a wider series of activities besides sexual activity with a consort. So it is probably intentional that an ambiguous term is used for the practice. 995 This information is taken from the chapter about the practice of the mantra path from ICe sgom 's Man ngag rin chen spungs pa 'i dkar chag (The Outline of the Jewel Mound of In-structions, ICe sgom rdzong pa pa I 97 I) which is translated in Ben tor 200 I: 33 7-346.

Kong sprul uses many different terms for disciplined conduct, some more general such as \"conduct\" (spyod pa), \"dis-ciplined conduct\" (brtul zhugs spyod pa) and \"mantric conduct\" (sngags f...yi spyod pa); and some more specific such as \"conduct that makes everyone tremble\" (kun 'dar gyi spyod pa ), \"totally good conduct\" (kun tu bzang po 'i spyod pa) and \"completely victorious conduct\" (phyogs las rnam rgyal gyi spyod pa).

The term used to describe the experience that entitles the practitioner to \"enter into the conduct\" is \"warmth\" (drod).1004 Steams explains that this term refers to \"a foretaste of attainments, in the sense that warmth is the initial sign that appears before fire.\"1005 \"Warmth\" is the first of four levels of the so-called \"path of connection\" (sbyor lam),1006 which is the second of the five paths (pmicamarga, lam lnga) in Mahayana Buddhism.1007 It is furthermore necessary that a person who practises disciplined conduct have no selfish motivation, but be solely moti-vated by compassion towards all sentient beings. The first stage of \"disciplined conduct\" is called either \"conduct that makes everyone tremble\" (kun 'dar kyi spyod pa), which translates Sanskrit avadhiitacmya.1008 This type of disciplined conduct is also sometimes called \"sinful conduct\" (sdig pa spyod pa), or \"non-dual [conduct]\" (gnyis spang).1009 According to Grags pa rgyal mtshan (1374-1432), other synony-mous terms for this practice are \"practising the observance of madness\" (smyon pa 'i brtul zhugs kyi spyod pa), the \"conduct of a young prince\" (rgyal bu gzhon nu 'i spyod pa) and \"secret conduct\" (gsang spyod).1010 Also sDe gzhung rin po che uses the term \"secret conduct\" (gsang ba'i spyod pa) for the first stage of disciplined conduct, and according to him the purpose of the practices is to go beyond the eight worldly concems.1 011 The first phase of this practice should be done in secret (i.e. at night) while the latter phase of the practice should be done in disguise (i.e. while pretending to be crazy). 1003 For an English summary of this practice, see Kong sprul 2005: 490, n. 39; Steams 2007: 60--61. 1004 See, for example, Kong sprul 2002: 939; bKra shis mam rgyal 1974: 620; Grags pa rgyal mtshan 1968: 48.1. 1005 Steams 2007: 60. 1006 The four levels of the path of connection are: (I) \"warmth\" (drod), (2) \"peak\" (rtse mo), (3). \"forbearance\" (bzod pa), and (4) \"supreme dharma\" (chos mchog). 10 7 The five paths are a standard technical description of the path to enlightenment: (I) \"the path of accumulation\" (tshogs lam, sambhilramiirga), (2) \"the path of connection\" (sbyor lam, prayogamiirga), (3) \"the path of seeing\" (mthong lam, darsanamiirga), (4) \"the path of medi-tation (sgom lam, bhiivaniimiirga), and (5) \"the path of no more leaming\" (mi slob pa'i lam, asaik~amiirga). 1008 The Tibetans often writes the Sanskrit word in a corrupt form, as avadhuticaryii or avadhiiticaryii. It should be avadhatacmya. Avadhiita means \"shaken off\", \"rejected\" etc. The term is sometimes used for an ascetic who has renounced all all worldly attachments and connections. Avadhiilacmyii is thus the name for the conduct of such an ascetic. 1009 These different terms sometimes seem to indicate various phases and/or aspects of the p,ractices performed during the first stage of disciplined conduct. 010 Grags pa rgyal mtshan 1968: 48.4. 1011 sDe gzhung, cited in Steams [Kalnins] 1985: 18, n. 42.

At that point the \"con-duct that makes everyone tremble\" should be performed in public, and when the \"great warmth\" (drod chen po) is obtained the practitioner should start to practise the next stage of disciplined conduct, to which we will return be-low.1012 The purpose of the first stage of disciplined conduct is to purify neg-ative karma, destroy dualistic grasping, and expel conceptual notions and clinging to things as truly existent. If the initial practice indicates that the practitioner's meditative realization is unstable, he or she should concentrate upon his or her meditation and not continue until stability in meditation is obtained. If the practitioner's meditative realization is stable, on the other hand, the practitioner continues practising for a month and then starts to perform the avadhrua conduct in public.1013 At this point the practitioner should publicly pretend to be a crazy person, a fool or another type of despised indi-vidual. Together with a consort or ~akin is, the practitioner does various kinds of unpredictable acts, such as singing, dancing, babbling, scolding, playing, laughing, running and leaping about in public, and engaging in prohibited sexual activities.1014 While engaging in all these outrageous and seemingly crazy activities the practitioner must keep his mind focused in meditation at all times, since the sole purpose of the conduct is to further meditative concentration.

According to the Ninth Karmapa (Karma pa, dbang phyug rdo tje, 1556-1603), practitioners with the highest capacity adopt the costume of a heruka when they have reached this stage and delib-erately enter into fearsome circumstances with no thoughts whatsoever of what is to be eaten or not, what is clean or dirty, or what is faulty or correct. By means of this practice the yogin gains victory over demonic impulses of mara, delusions and Hinayana motivations. Thus it is called the \"completely victorious conduct\". 1019 bKra shis mam rgyal (1512113-1587) makes a similar three-fold division of conduct in his work Mahamudrii-The Moonlight, but he also describes other ways of classifying these practices.1020 He moreover points out that monks are only allowed to carry out these practices as long as their vow of celibacy remains unaffected.1021 According to bKra shis mam rgyal there are five kinds of conduct that are to be performed by a practitioner who is carrying out these practices: \"the conduct that resembles a wounded deer\" (ri dwags smas ma Ita bu'i spyod pa), \"the conduct that resembles a lion\" (seng ge Ita bu'i spyod pa), \"the conduct that resembles wind blowing through space\" (bar snang gi rlung Ita bu 'i spyod pa), \"the conduct that resembles the sky\" (nam mkha' Ita bu'i spyod pa), and finally \"the conduct that resembles a madman\" (smyon pa Ita bu 'i spyod pa).1022 Although several of these five ways of conduct are rele-vant to the mad yo gins of Tibet, the last one is of particular·interest. bKra shis mam rgyal explains \"the conduct that resembles a madman\" as follows: \"A mad person lacks any objective direction. Thus a meditator should not have any attachment to anything, such as affirmation or rejection, acceptance or abandonment.\"1023 These practices are also mentioned by rTse le sna 1018 sDe gzhung, cited in Steams [Kalnins] 1985: 18, n. 42. 1019 Karmapa, Ninth 1989: 101. 1020 Phyag chen zla ba ·; 'ad zer. bKra shis mam rgyal 1974: 622.

Having the conduct of a madman would be good. Having the conduct of a leper would be good. Having the conduct of a wild animal would be good.1027 These examples from Tibetan masters who lived both before, during and after gTsang smyon clearly show that a great deal of authoritative scriptures and commentaries were available to support gTsang smyon's unconventional behavior. Tibetan and Indian texts sometimes advocated that these kinds of conduct could and should be carried out to progress more quickly on the path. For a practitioner who had reached the second of the five paths, the \"path of connection\", disciplined conduct and other related kinds of conduct made it possible to progress rapidly towards the next step on their path to-wards awakening, namely the \"path of seeing\". For example, bKra shis rnam rgyal maintains that progress can be achieved more rapidly during a single month of secret conduct under terrifying conditions, in rough terrain and in the abode of harmful forces, than by meditating for a period of three years in towns and monasteries. 102M Many of the key terms, texts and practices that are used for, or in associa-tion with a seemingly mad and transgressive behavior in Tantric Buddhism were also used by gTsang smyon's disciples when they wrote the rnam thars about their guru. The most central term encountered is \"disciplined conduct\" (brtul zhugs spyod pa), but the term \"equalisation of taste\" (ro snyoms) is also often encountered.

As we have seen, madness and other forms of unconventional behavior are an accepted and even prescribed part of advanced tantric practice. Since all the Tibetan Buddhist traditions accept the tantras, they all include these practices, at least in theory. However, according to the exegetical literature, these types of practices could be hazardous for the practitioner if s/he is not properly prepared for them. They could also be misused by charlatans who deceive people and practise with the wrong motivation. ICe sgom pa men-tions that it is important that these forms of practice only be carried out by practitioners who have attained the proper inner realization: If those Mantra practices are not performed in accordance with the timing of the practice, if the beginner performs the taming of engagement of awareness or the \"practice of the crazy yogin,\" that will later become a cause for a lower rebirth. Therefore it is very important to perform in accordance with the tim-ing of the practice. 1032 ICe sgom pa was not alone in warning practitioners not to engage in this type of practice without being properly prepared. The bKa' brgyud scholar bKra shis rnam rgyal similarly points out that a practitioner should not enter into the conduct (spyod pa Ia 'jug pa) at the wrong time, namely before s/he has experienced \"inner heat\" (drod) as a sign of realization.1033 He moreover states that there are some people who embark upon these practices and wan-der about at crossroads and charnel grounds just to become famous. 1034 They have thus totally misunderstood the purpose of these practices, namely to 1029 See for example, G: 25. 1030 See: for example, G: 24, T: 41. 1031 See, for example, L: 48. 1032 ICe sgom cited in Bentor 2001: 346.

This problem is built into Tantric Buddhism and the Tibetans have struggled with it ever since Bud-dhism was brought to the Tibetan plateau.1041 gTsang smyon's Opinion about \"Disciplined Conduct\" Let us now turn to the answer gTsang smyon gave to mDzad khram pa's question that was cited at the very beginning of this chapter. The question concerned what experiences and qualities a practitioner must have before being allowed to use the heruka garments. According to rGod tshang ras pa, gTsang smyon began his answer by emphasizing that a person who wanted 1035 b Kra shis mam rgyal 1974: 621: yid brtan pa dang g.yo ba thams cad chos nyid kyi ngo bor ro mnyam pa; For an alternative English translation, see Namgyal 2006: 337. 1036 Lam me hog rin po che 'i phreng ba. 1037 Gampopa 1995: 33; sGam po pa 2000: 65: 'khrulzhigdang bdudkhyer!a nor sayod. 1038 Gampopa 1995: 33; sGam po pa 2000: 65: grub thob dang zogpo Ia nor sayod. 1039 Patrul Rinpoche 1994: 140; dPal sprul Rin po che 2004: 215: grub pa 'i mdzad spyod /tar bt,ed pas kun spyod gnam du gshegs pa; lam log par 'khrid. 1 40 Patrul Rinpoche 1994: 146; dPal sprul Rin po che 2004: 226: 'phags pa'i yul gyi dbang phyug phal mo che II gdol pa g.yung po sdig spyod phal pa 'i tshu/11 nyams pa las kyang shin tu nyams par yod II. 1041 There are many examples of this; the most well-known example is probably the misuse of tantric practices that, according to Tibetan historical records, occurred after the first spread of the doctrine. During that period Buddhism degenerated and some tantric practitioners misused the tantric teachings and performed tantric rituals and practices in a literal manner (see, for example, Tucci 1980: 16-17). Atisa was then invited to Tibet arrl actively promoted a more graclual path, emphasizing that the tantras should only be practiced by practitioners who pos-sess th(! proper foundation, and it was also emphasized that the tantric teachings should not be performed in a literal way. 203"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"to dress and act as a heruka had to tum away from samsara and the suffer-ings of the lower realms.1042 Then the yogin must enter into the door of the Buddhist doctrine and completely give up the eight worldly concerns. With such a foundation the individual should have undergone training in both the individual liberation (so sor thar pa, priitimok~a) and the bodhisattva disci-plines. gTsang smyon specifically states that the vows of these two disci-plines must not have been transgressed. In other words, a practitioner who wants to embark on the \"heruka path\" must have undergone much prior training in the Hinayana and Mahayana vehicles. Having this foundation, the yogin must obtain tantric empowerments and instructions from an excellent guru/lama. The candidate must, moreover realize both the words and the meaning of the tantric teachings and practices. Not only that, the yogin must have attained experience and realization as a result of his or her practice. Only at this point may a practitioner, who thus has reached the time for con-duct (spyod la'i dus Ia bab pa cig), start to wear the heruka garments. If the time for conduct truly has arrived, the practitioner should start with the \"to-tally good conduct\" when residing on the \"path of accumulation\" and then continue with the \"secret conduct\" when arriving at the \"path of connec-tion\". Then at the \"path of seeing\" when the wind (rlung) and mind (sems) have entered the central channel (dbu ma) the practitioner will be able to display his/her higher perceptions (mngon shes, abhijiiii) and powers (nus pa) outwardly and thereby influence those who lack faith, and also be able to bring all circumstances onto the path (rkyen lam du slangs). The practitioner may now perform the activities associated with the ritual feast of the consort observance (rig pa brtul zhugs tshogs kyi spyod pa).1043 gTsang smyon finally states that practitioners who have not attained all these powers, but who have never transgressed the sacred commitments (dam tshig, samaya) and vows (sdom pa, saf!ivara) of the Secret Mantra tradition, and are able to control their afflictions (klesa, nyon mongs pa) by applying appropriate antidotes inwardly, and benefit the teachings out-wardly, are also allowed to wear the heruka implements.1044 It is noteworthy that gTsang smyon used many of the terms that were dis-cussed above, and also that he was very careful to situate the practices asso-ciated with the heruka outfit within a wider Buddhist context. Not least did he emphasize that a person who embarks upon such practices must have a thorough background in non-tantric Buddhism, and that he or she must have kept his or her vows undamaged. He furthermore situates the specific con-duct within the \"five paths\", and in a startlingly similar way to Kong sprul and other exegetes, he connects certain types of conduct with certain stages of the path. 1042 l will paraphrase gTsang smyon's answer; compare my rendering with G: 230-231. 1043 G: 230-231. 1044 G: 231. 204"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Chapter 9: The \"School of gTsang smyon\" The main sources of this study were all written by gTsang smyon's direct disciples.

These texts provide us with much additional information about gTsang smyon and his lineage. gTsang smyon also compiled and printed several texts himself. Moreover, there are texts about gTsang smyon 's disciples, about disciples of these dis-ciples, and also about gTsang smyon's main teacher.

The \"School\" or \"Workshop\" of gTsang smyon In his survey of the printing activities of gTsang smyon and his disciples, Kurtis Schaeffer notes that gTsang smyon initiated a tradition of printing that was to continue for almost a century after his death. 1045 According to one of the life stories of gTsang smyon, it was an exhortion from Naropa in a dream that inspired him to compile texts and make block-prints.1046 His disciples disliked the idea of engaging in this very difficult enterprise and tried to persuade gTsang smyon to postpone it, but to no avail.1047 At the time, many of these hagiographies and esoteric instructions only existed as manuscripts. gTsang smyon feared that the life stories and instructions might be lost and decided to compile and print them. The technology of wood-block printing that he used had only been in Tibet for about sixty years when gTsang smyon printed his first major works-the life story and song collection of Milarepa. He later wrote down and printed other texts, and his disciples fol-lowed in his track. gTsang smyon was thus a pivotal figure in Tibet's transi-1045 Schaeffer, forthcoming. 1046 L: 96-97.

Franz-Karl Ehrhard has suggested that on the basis of stylistic criteria of the Buddhist printed texts one may identify individual \"schools\" or \"workshops\", and that these could then be named after the leading figures or religious communities with which the Buddhist artists and craftsmen affiliated themselves.1048 One can thus speak of the \"school of gTsang smyon\" or the \"workshop of gTsang smyon\", which consisted of gTsang smyon, his disciples and other affiliated people. \"The school of gTsang smyon\" continued to produce texts long after gTsang smyon's death. Schaeffer has suggested that Sangs rgyas Dar po's work on the history of the bKa' brgyud tradition from 1568 may be a con-venient place to draw a close to these activities.1049 Gene Smith once stated that \"gTsang smyon fostered a whole school of bKa' brgyud pa biographical works\" and he supplied details for about twenty-two works published as wood-block-prints by gTsang smyon and his disciples.1050 Since that time, mainly due to the efforts of the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Pro-ject many more texts that were compiled and printed by gTsang smyon and his disciples have appeared. Schaeffer has identified approximately fifty-five prints from the same group of scholars and craftsmen, and since the NGMPP conducted further photographic expeditions for some two years after Schaeffer's investigation we may anticipate that new works belonging to \"the school of gTsang smyon\" will appear.1051 After the passing away of gTsang smyon, the activities of the \"school of gTsang smyon\" centered around rOod tshang ras pa and Lha btsun. These two masters resided in different parts of Tibet: Lha btsun in Brag dkar rta so, near sKyid grong; and rOod tshang ras pa in Ras chung phug, south of rTse thang. Both Brag dkar rta so and Ras chung phug became important centers of printing activities. That Lha btsun and rOod tshang ras pa were aware of each other's activities and cooperated is indicated by the fact that no dupli-cate works were published at both Brag dkar rta so and Ras chung phug.1052 Before looking at the life and works of these two central figures, let us turn to the literary works of their teacher, gTsang smyon. 1048 Ehrhard, forthcoming b. 1049 Schaeffer, forthcoming. 1050 Smith 200 I: 61. 1051 Schaeffer, forthcoming. 1052 Schaeffer, fonhcoming. 206"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"gTsang smyon's Own Works gTsang smyon was a prolific writer/compiler who authored some of Tibet's most famous and popular literary works.

Although a description and analysis of gTsang smyon's own works is somewhat beyond the aims of the present study, a tentative overview and discussion of his works will enable us to get closer to gTsang smyon and see him from another angle.

The life story was given the title the Life of the Great Powerful Lord of Yogins rJe btszm Mi-larepa, which Teaches the Path of Liberation and Omniscience1oss and the song collection was given the title the Collected Songs which Expand on the Life of rJe btszm Milarepa.10s6 Andrew Quintman notes that no copy of gTsang smyon's original block-print has yet appeared. But two manuscripts that are preserved in the archives of the Nepal-German Manuscript Preserva-tion Project in Kathmandu seem to have been copied from this first print-ing.10s7 The original printing blocks that had been made under gTsang smyon's supervision were eventually worn out, and new ones had to be made.

Its great status has made it comparable to the canonical scriptures of Tibet. Not only Tibetans have discovered the life story and song collection of Milarepa, however, but their popularity is almost universal. Many scholars have acknowledged that this particular version of Milarepa's life story and song collection stands apart hom other hagiographies and collection of songs. Giuseppe Tucci, who generally found rnam thars to be boring and tedious, remarked that the life story of Milarepa in contrast was one of few \"noble masterpieces breathing a fresh, serene and robust poetic spirit.\"1061 Also R. A. Stein remarked that the rnam thars of Milarepa and Marpa that gTsang smyon authored are \"distinguished from many other, quite boring and pedantic, works by their near, colloquial language, their lively style, and above all the interest they take in countless details of real life.\" Stein more-over states that \"it is just this communion of the 'mad' saints with popular sources of inspiration that made them the greatest creators of Tibetan litera-ture.\"1062 Gene Smith once remarked that gTsang smyon's \"biography (rnam thar) and collected poems (mgur 'bum) of Mi Ia ras pa are among the great masterpieces of Tibetan and world literature.\"1063 Stanley Tambiah, similarly, suggests that the biography of Milarepa and the biography of the Thai forest-monk Acham Mun could be considered the \"flowers of the Buddhist hagio-logical tradition.\"1064 These are only a few examples of the praise that the hagiography and song collection that gTsang smyon composed has received.

These visual narratives expanded his audience to incl11de non-literate communities and they helped to promote his version of the life story and make it the standard version of Milarepa's life story (G: 147, 158, 161; Quintman 2006: 207-208). 1061 Tucci 1949: 151. 1062 Stein 1972: 276. 1061 Smith 2001:61. 1064 Tambiah 1984: 128. 208"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"praise, however, but the many translations and editions that have been made of the texts.1065 Since how gTsang smyon composed the life of Milarepa has been de-scribed in great detail by both Steams [Kalnins] and Quintman,1066 I will not expand on it here, but instead tum to another question that could also be asked: Is it Milarepa or gTsang smyon who talks to us in the famous life story? If one compares older versions of Milarepa's life story with the ver-sion that gTsang smyon composed one discovers several differences.1067 These innovations contributed to the popularity of gTsang smyon's versions of both the hagiography and the song collection. They might also give us information about gTsang smyon himself and about the time period during which he lived. Quintman points out that \"the contemporary study of autobi-ography has become increasingly aware of an autobiographical presence within biographical literature.\"1068 He also notes that \"the writing of biogra-phy is to some degree a self-reflexive process through which the author de-fines the subject in terms of his own position.\"1069 One important innovation that gTsang smyon contributed was to trans-form the third-person narrative into a first person account. Quintman notes that \"as an ostensibly autobiographical narrative, the story of Mi Ia ras pa's life garnered an immediacy that masked nearly four centuries of repetition and revision.\"1070 It should be noticed that this innovation probably contrib-uted a great deal to the eventual success of gTsang smyon 's version. By let-ting Milarepa tell the story to Ras chung pa, gTsang smyon's biography be-came an autobiography. This rhetorical move gives more weight to the story, and it conveys the impression that the reader/listener is in direct contact with Milarepa's own words. The life story starts with the words, \"Thus did I hear, one time.\"1071 This is the traditional beginning of a Buddhist sutra, and as Donald Lopez explains, this beginning gives a clear signal to the reader/listener: \"By using these famous words to open his text, the author signals to the reader that they are about to hear the teaching of a buddha, and that the rapporteur of the teaching, in this case, Rechung (Ras chung], speaks with the authority of a witness.\"10n 1065 It is beyond the scope of this dissertation to mention all the translations and editions that have appeared of these texts over the years, all over the world.

This resulted in a much more accessible text that could be understood also by people without much prior knowledge of Bud-dhism. gTsang smyon also shifted Milarepa's status from a miraculous emana-tion to that of an ordinary human. Quintman notes that \"gTsang smyon was the first-and perhaps the only-author to categorically deny the yogin's status as a previously awakened buddha, contradicting numerous works in the biographical tradition including most of his principal sources. \"1073 This change was important in several ways. It made Milarepa more human and thereby easier for the reader to identify with. It also proved that an ordinary human being-even a sinner-could obtain complete liberation (rnam thar). Milarepa thus became a living example who proves the efficacy of the Secret Mantra methods. In gTsang smyon's life story of Milarepa there is a section that describes how rNgan rdzong asks Milarepa if he is the incarnation of a buddha or a bodhisattva. Milarepa replies that \"It is possible for every ordi-nary man to persevere as I have done. To consider a man of such persever-ance as the reincarnation of a Buddha or as a Bodhisattva is a sign of not believing in the short path.\"1074 To present Milarepa as an ordinary being might also be seen as an indirect critique of the system of reincarnation that had become increasingly impor-tant during gTsang smyon's lifetime. In some ways gTsang smyon's version of the life story thus mirrors the times in which it was written. This is of course logical, and there are further examples of it in the life story. Another theme that seems at least partly to reflect the time when gTsang smyon lived, rather than when Milarepa lived, is the constant criticism against monk-scholars that is found in gTsang smyon's version of the life story and song collection. This critique is also found in older versions, but gTsang smyon adapted it to his times and sometimes deliberately portrayed learned monks and dge bshes as the \"bad guys\" of the story. Although rudi-mentary versions of some of these stories and songs are also found in older versions, there are some examples showing that gTsang smyon sometimes changed older versions. The most poignant and pronounced example is probably the last chapter of the rnam thar in which the bon priest who in earlier versions poisons Milarepa becomes transformed into a jealous dge 1073 Quintman 2006: 221. Milarepa is described as an emanation in all the earlier sources according to Peter Alan Roberts (Roberts 2007: 78-80). 1074 Lhalungpa 1979: 144-145; gTsang smyon 1979: 143-144: snying rus nga'i 'di bas mi zhan paso skye snying rus can kunIa yang bar 'dug I byung !she sangs rgyas dang byang chub sems dpa 'i .1prul par rlom pa 'Jug ste I gsang sngags gyi nye lam Ia yid rna ches pa'i rtags yin pas I. 210"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"bshes.1~75 Ther~ are also _several song~ that por~ray monk-scholars and dge bshes m negattve ways m the collectiOn of Mtlarepa's songs that gTsang smyon compiled.1076 To fully understand the reasons behind the polemics against monk-scholars we should consider the religious climate at the time when gTsang smyon compiled the L~(e and Songs ofMilarepa. gTsang smyon and the oth-er mad yogins represented an extreme position in a debate concerning how Buddhism should be practised. According to the mad yogins, a person who wanted to progress on the path to awakening should become a yogin and vigorously practise Tantric Buddhism in remote areas, and it did not matter much whether one was a learned monk or an illiterate lay person. Faith and diligence enabled anyone to practise Tantric Buddhism and obtain results. Intellectual learning was not necessarily anything negative, but it could be a fault if it led to pride and egotism. gTsang smyon was thus involved in po-lemics with some learned monks (dge bshes) of the recently founded dGe lugs pa tradition, but also with monk-scholars of other traditions. The dispute concerned how Buddhism should be practised, and especially when and how the more advanced tantric practices should be undertaken. gTsang smyon skillfully used Milarepa as a tool in this debate. By letting Milarepa say things that gTsang smyon himself believed in, his arguments became hard to refute. Moreover it might be of interest to investigate if gTsang smyon purposely presented Milarepa as a mad yogin and thereby promoted the way of the mad yogins in Tibet. In his Ph.D. dissertation The Hermeneutics of Madness: A Literary and Hermeneutical Analysis of the \"Mi la'i rnam thar\" by gTsang smyon Heruka, Robert Everett Goss examines gTsang smyon's version of the life story of Milarepa and one of the main arguments of the dissertation is that \"gTsang smyon composed the ·rnam thar with a reformist intent.\"1077 Goss also asserts that gTsang smyon \"portrayed the poet-saint Mi Ia as a mad saint to justify the mad saint movement (smyon pa) in Tibet.\"1078 While I agree with Goss that gTsang smyon indeed seems to have had a specific intention when he composed the rnam thar,1079 I feel more uncertain about 1075 Quintman 2006: 202, n. 30. Quintman informed me that he has found a rare account of this incident by Zhi byed ri khrod pa, finished in 1373, that also describes the poisoner as a dge bshes. This shows that the anti-scholar theme existed in the biographical tradition even prior to gTsang smyon. Quintman is currently preparing an article about this account. (Quint-man, personal communication, November 30, 2008). 1076 See, for example, chapter 34, 42,43 and 44 in Milarepa's mgur 'bum. 1077 Goss 1993: abstract. IOJH Goss 1993: abstract. 107'! I fa II actions are preceded by intention, it is nevertheless difficult to determine such inten-tion, or even to ascribe a single intention to any given act. The stated intention that gTsang smyon provides is that he wrote down the rnam thar of Milarepa to benelit the teachings and the beings (see Chapter 7). We may also assume that he had some more or less hidden and perhaps unconscious motivation when he composed the famous life story. These hidden in ten-211"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"his second argument. Compared with the mam thars about gTsang smyon and other mad yogins, comparatively few really bizarre and mad actions are depicted in Milarepa's life story. Milarepa appears to have been a great as-cetic, a great meditator and a great yogin, but not a.mad yogin. Milarepa was indeed called mad in the song that began the dissertation. But that song merely uses madness as a metaphor for enlightenment.10110 Although there are parallels between gTsang smyon and Milarepa there are also many differ-ences. Milarepa seldom behaves in a mad way, and he is seldom called a mad yogin in the texts, including those composed by gTsang smyon. This is in sharp contrast to gTsang smyon and the other smyon pas. There is one episode, however, in the mam thar where Milarepa indeed acts in a quite bizarre way, and here gTsang smyon might have exaggerated his behavior so that Milarepa appeared to be a mad yogin rather than just a yogin. On one occasion Milarepa's sister Peta visited her brother in his isolated mountain retreat Milarepa's nakedness embarrassed Peta and upset her. She wept and said, \"From whatever point of view one looks at my elder brother, one cannot call him a man. You should ask for alms and little_by little eat the food that humans eat. I will give you what you need to make clothes.\"1081 Later Peta returned with cloth that she had woven for Milarepa. While searching for her brother she met a lama who was dressed in silk and sat upon a high throne beneath a canopy. A great crowd offered him tea and beer. When she found her brother in sKyid phug she told him: \"My elder brother's religion provides him with nothing to eat and nothing to wear. This is shameful and I will no longer stand for it. Make a loincloth from this ma-terial which I have woven.\"1082 [ ••• ] While speaking she wept. Milarepa an-swered, \"Do not speak like that. My nakedness and my unconventional be-havior embarrass you. But I am content with this body of mine which en-abled me to encounter religion. So I have nothing to be ashamed of. Since I was born naked, I have no cause for shame\"[ ... ].1083 tions do not necessarily contradict his \"official\" motivation to benefit the beings, however, since his \"reformist intent\" might be motivated by just that. IOHO It is also imprtant that the song was included in a song collection that was au-thored/compiled by gTsang smyon. His disciple, Lha btsun, also includes this song, but it is not yet known if the song of madness existed in older versions. The song of madness might thus be an example showing that gTsang smyon inserted the theme of madness into the tradi-tion of M ilarepa. 1081 Lhalungpa 1979: 125; gTsang smyon 1979: 124: da ajo Ia gang nas bltas rung mi 'i ming rang mi 'dug pas I bsod snyoms re mdzod Ia mi zas dum re gso/ I ngas na bza' zhig ci 'byor b~as Ia 'bul du yong zer I. 1 Hl Lhalungpa 1979: 135; gTsang smyon 1979: 134: ajo 'i chos kha Ia bza' rg;~1 yang med I Ius Ia gyon rgyu yang med pas khrel ngo tsha nas bud pa 'dis mi yong bar 'dug Ida snam bu 'di Ia smad g.yogs gcig mdzod Ia.

I will return soon.\" I promised to stay there a few days. When my sister had gone to Dingri, I made a hood to cover my head and sewed a sleeve for each of my fingers and for my feet. Then I sewed a sheath for my sexual organ. My sister returned at the end of a few days and asked, \"Brother have you sewn the cloth?\" \"I have.\" I put them on and I showed her the sheaths I had made for each of my ex-tremities. She exclaimed, \"Look at him! My brother has nothing human left in him! Not only is he completely without shame, but he has also ruined the cloth that I wove with such labor. Is it because he has no time to do anything but medi-tate, or is it because he has too much time?\"1084 Although Milarepa tries to explain why he made the sheaths, and tells his sister that he made them since he considered each part of the body to be of equal worth, it is a bit hard to understand why a yogin who had no time to do anything other than meditate devotes time and energy to making sheaths for his limbs. This could perhaps be explained as some kind of teaching for his sister but in this particular scene Milarepa does indeed seem a bit mad, or at least he seems to have had a rather bizarre sense of humor. An older rnam thar does refer to this story in a general way, but M ilarepa does not sew the individual garments, he just allows the cloth to disintegrate and continues to be naked.1085 Here we thus see an example of how gTsang smyon perhaps gave a bizarre twist to the life story ofMilarepa and thereby made Milarepa appear a bit mad. It would seem logical if Milarepa just ignored the clothes and continued with his meditation, but in gTsang smyon's version he makes sheaths of it It is however important to note that Milarepa did not publicly act out in a seemingly crazy way as a kind of antinomian skilful means as gTsang smyon and the other mad yogins often did.

Finally, no one in the story considers Milarepa to be a mad yogin. Since his sister Peta later changes her mind about her brother and becomes a devoted cotton-clad yogin I (ras pa), th~ incident with the sheaths does afterall appear to be a teaching directed to his sister, and indeed to the reader of the story. The theme of madness also sometimes appears in gTsang smyon's ver-sion of Milarepa's song collection. The Song of Madness to Dam pa sangs rgyas has already been mentioned, and is the most obvious example, but there are some more. For instance, in the chapter about the attack by and subsequent conversion of the Five Sisters of Long Life,1086 Milarepa calls himself\"a mad ascetic who knows not disgrace and shame.\"1087 Milarepa, as portrayed by gTsang smyon, thus is occasionally presented as a mad yogin, but, these references are rather few and do not make him a mad yogin. Over-all, \"holy madness\" is not a striking feature of Milarepa 's hagiography a11d song collection, and Tibetans do not generally refer to Milarepa as a mad yogin. Milarepa is the perfect yogin and ascetic, but the perfect mad yogins and mad ascetics appeared later, and gTsang smyon was one of them. Despite his own status as a mad yogin, and despite a few episodes such as those narrated above, it seem clear to me that gTsang smyon refrained from making Milarepa into a mad yogin. On the contrary, the innovations in his version of the life story made Milarepa less controversial and less problem-atic than he was in earlier texts. This being said, it should be admitted that even the minor elements of \"madness\"-which gTsang smyon in some cases perhaps allowed to remain, and in other instances probably wrote into the story-contributed in making it possible for the mad saints to refer to Mi-larepa when justifying their own \"mad way\" of practice. There might there-fore be some point in Goss's assertion regarding the intention of gTsang smyon when composing the rnam thar. However, as noted, I do not believe that the general picture of Milarepa that gTsang smyon conveyed in the texts is that of a mad yogin. It is therefore, in my opinion, an overstatement to say with Goss that he \"portrayed the poet-saint Mi Ia as a mad saint to justify the mad saint movement (smyon pa) in Tibet\".1088 gTsang smyon did not portray Milarepa as a mad yogin, but he inserted some subtle elements of madness into the story, it seems, and by so doing he managed to pave the way for the \"real mad yogins\" and justify their way of practising Buddhism. gTsang smyon, thus applied very refined and subtle methods to achieve his goal.

In an unpublished article, Kristin Blancke has shown that older versions ofMilarepa's life story often mention that the monk-scholars that Milarepa criticized belonged to the bKa' gdams pa tradition. gTsang smyon kept the anti-scholastic agenda but omitted the references to bKa' gdams pa, according to Blancke.1089 Milarepa.---as pre-sented in his rnam thar-thus became less controversial. Since the founder of the four greater and eight lesser bKa' brgyud traditions, sGam po pa, was a bKa' gdams pa monk, the established bKa' brgyud traditions were a mix-ture of bKa' gdams pa's monasticism and Milarepa's esoteric yogic teach-ings. Atisa and the bKa' gdams pa tradition had also been integrated into other traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, and Milarepa's life story probably would not have been accepted as widely as it was if the critique of them had remained. gTsang smyon also made other changes in his version of the story. For example, he emphasized sGam po pa's primacy as Milarepa's foremost dis-ciple.1090 This was important because it enabled all the bKa' brgyud traditions that stemmed from sGam po pa to embrace gTsang smyon's version.1091 Ilze Maruta Stearns [Kalnins] notes that a major factor contributing to the popu-larity of gTsang smyon's version was the acceptance and praise it received from the Seventh Karmapa, Chos grags rgya mtsho, who was one of the most important religious figures at the time and the head of the Karma bKa' brgyud tradition. 1092 If gTsang smyon had not presented sGam po pa as Mi-larepa's foremost disciple it would likely have been difficult for the Kar-mapa, and other religious dignitaries in the bKa' brgyud tradition to accept it. gTsang smyon thus downplayed the role of Ras chung pa to whom Mi-larepa told his life story according to his version of the text. He did this in spite of the fact that he had strong personal bonds to transmissions that stemmed from Ras chung pa.1093 Ras chung pais one of the key characters in both gTsang smyon's life story of Milarepa and of his song collection of Milarepa. But despite giving him so much room in his texts, gTsang smyon presented him as a rather controversial and problematic disciple who often disobeyed Milarepa.1094 Furthermore, gTsang smyon removed some sections of older Milarepa hagiographies that contained polemics against the gradual approach to en-lightenment. This gradual approach had been accepted by the majority of Buddhists by the time of gTsang smyon, and the bKa' gdams pas were in-1089 Blancke, unpublished: I I. 1090 Roberts 2007: 3.

For example, both were lay tantric yogins and both emphasized the impor-tance of the tantric practices. 11\"'1 See, for example, Roberts 2007: 149. 215"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"strumental in spreading this approach. The tantric path and the Mahamudra teachings that gTsang smyon's own lineage were focused upon often advo-cated a more direct path to enlightenment and thus were sometimes in oppo-sition to the gradual path. Blancke has shown that_gTsang smyon's version of Milarepa's Life and Songs contains passages where Milarepa advocates a gradual approach that corresponds better with the Mahayana siitric approach of the bKa' gdams pa than with tantric practices that Milarepa taught accord-ing to older versions of his life story and songs.1095 This is a further example of how gTsang smyon made subtle changes in the life story, thereby making it less controversial. gTsang smyon belonged to a non-monastic lineage that lacked an institu-tional foundation. He followed closely in the foot steps of Milarepa and the bKa' brgyud forefathers, and actively promoted and emulated them. But at the same time he seemed aware of the fact that his works must be accepted by the monks and their institutions if he wanted to get his message across. Peter Alan Roberts has described how gTsang smyon has altered the text slightly in his version of the songs of Milarepa and thereby created interest-ing shifts in meaning. At one particular section of the texts gTsang smyon has made some small changes to an older version and the end result is that Milarepa says: \"I am a yogin but afterwards there will also be many monks.\"1096 Roberts comments upon these prophetic words and states that the fact that this declaration is made by Milarepa to his own non-monastic community intensifies its import. He moreover points out that \"the passage is often quoted to demonstrate the legitimacy of the monastic Dakpo Kagyu [Dwags po bka' brgyud] lineage in spite of its yogin origins.\"1097 These examples show that gTsang smyon made many innovations in his texts. While some of the innovations concerned narrative technique, others concerned the content of the life story and songs. These innovations brought life to Milarepa 's life story and to his songs and also contributed to gaining them acceptance. Despite denying Milarepa's position as an emanation in his life story, gTsang smyon paradoxically became so intimately connected with Milarepa that he was regarded as Milarepa's emanation. gTsang smyon was generally evasive about his previous lives, but he sometimes made allusions and said enigmatic things that showed that he saw himself as Milarepa incarnate.1098 Quintman notes that gTsang smyon 's rnam thar of Milarepa \"can be read, in part, as his own autobiography, an autobiographical biography, a life within 1095 Blancke, unpublished: 20.

The statements and allusions of this kind that gTsang smyon made have been translated and analyzed at length by both Steams [Kalnins) 1985: 75-83 and Quintman 2006: 253-261. 216"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"a life.\"1099 This was also part of the reason for the great success of his work. Because gTsang smyon so thoroughly identified himself with Milarepa that he \"became Milarepa\" his version became different from other versions and full of life. gTsang smyon believed that he was Milarepa, he meditated in the same caves as Milarepa, ate the same food, walked the same paths, smelled the same smells, and so forth. So when he transformed Milarepa's life story into an autobiography by making it a first person account it was more than a narrative technique; he expressed his heartfelt closeness with Milarepa and often \"spoke\" from his own experience. The Life of Marpa Around 1505, just two years before his death, gTsang smyon stayed in \"Chu bar, the nirmiil)akaya palace, the supreme place where Lord Milarepa at-tained perfect, complete buddhahood\"1100 and there he printed a rnam thar and collection of songs (mgur 'bum) of Marpa, Milarepa's teacher, that he had composed.1101 The rnam thar was given the name the Life of Marpa the Translator which is Meaning/it! to Behold and it was 75 folios long.1102 Gene Smith's list of the different editions of this text shows that the rnam thar of Marpa also became popular and widely disseminated in Tibet.1103 Vostrikov notes that this rnam thar \"is extremely popular in Tibet and abroad.\"1104 The song collection has remained obscure and no translation of it has ap-peared. The Nepal German Manuscript Preservation Project has a microfilm copy of it and the title is the Collected Songs of Marpa the Translator.1105 The song collection is 40 folios long in the later edition that was printed by Lha btsun 1552 (?) at Brag dkar rta so.1106 Given the importance of Marpa's rnam thar it is peculiar that neither Lha btsun nor dNgos grub dpal 'bar cares to mention it in their rnam thars about gTsang smyon.

The life story of Marpa became an important text that-although not as popular and disseminated as Milarepa's-was widely read and accepted as authoritative far beyond the bKa' brgyud traditions. The Aural Transmission Compilation The popularity of the life stories and song collections ofMarpa and Milarepa might overshadow gTsang smyon's largest literary production-an extensive collection of the Aural Transmissions (snyan brgyud) of the bKa' brgyud tradition. gTsang smyon worked on this project for the greater part of his life and completed it just before he died. The compilation contains many original works by gTsang smyon, and also works by other masters of the tradition. As seen above, gTsang smyon was a lineage holder of several different bKa' brgyud Aural Transmissions and he devoted his whole life to practis-ing, and transmitting them.1108 Marta Semesi, calls him \"one of the great systematisers of the tradition.\"1109 gTsang smyon's disciple rGod tshang ras pa became his principal successor as the lineage holder of the Aural Trans-mission but his other disciples also continued to disseminate these teachings after their master's death.1110 According to Lha btsun, gTsang smyon wrote a text called An Outline of the Adamantine Verses that Dispels the Darkness of Ignorance associated with the Aural Transmission during his first stay in Tsari}111 dNgos grub dpal 'bar also mentions that gTsang smyon composed an Aural Transmission 1107 G: 235. 1108 For a description ofthe Aural Transmission and how gTsang smyon received it, see Chap-ter4. 1109 Semesi, forthcoming.

Since the many profound [instructions] about practice were hidden in-side the Aural Transmission, [gTsang smyon] was afi·aid [that these impor-tant instructions] would disappear in these degenerate times [and he] com-posed many rituals about the visualization of ma!)Qalas [etc. ].1113 rOod tshang ras pa also describes how gTsang smyon composed many Aural Transmission texts during his three-year retreat in La phyi.1114 dNgos grub dpal 'bar mentions the name of some of the texts gTsang smyon composed in La phyi, and among the titles we find: The Siidhana of the Revered Innate Goddess, 1115 The Root-verses of Ora/Instructions, 1116 The Oral Instntctions of the Body-mar.ujala,1111 The Universal Panacea of the Vira,1118 The Si,; Or-naments,1119 and also a fire-ritual,1120 and a consecration ritual.1121 The compi-lation that gTsang smyon made \"became similar to a guide (lam mkhan) or eyes (mig) of the oral precepts for those in the degenerate time [who aspire for] the accomplishment of enlightenment in one life. And it also made the 1112 N: 15b. It should be noted that the three disciples (G, Land N) have different opinions regarding when gTsang smyon composed certain texts. Some names of texts will therefore occur several times in the following description. rGod tshang ras pa describes that it was a visionary encouter with Vajrayoginl that occurred before he went to Tsari that compelled ~Tsang smyon to propagate the Aural Transmission lineage (G: 116; Semesi 2007 a: 103). 113 N: 17a: gong du smos pa'i gdams pa mkha' 'gro snyan rgyud kyi chu ba'i rgyud Ia I sngon pod du rje btsun mi Ia Ia sags pa 'i mkhas grub mang pas yig cha mdzad pa yod kyang I phal cher nyams len gyi tho /sam re las rna bkud cing I mngon rlogs dkyil cho ga mang po mdzad nasI nyams I en gyi zab rgu rnams snyan rgyud du sbas pas 1/nga brgyar gyur pa na nub kyis dogs leI. 11140: 158-159.

According to rGod tshang ras pa he composed the following titles at that time: Body Mat;cja/a,1126 The Venerable innate Mother,1127 An Empowerment of the Pro-tector Amitayus,1128 A Few Words Summarizing the Oral Jnstructions,1129 The Six Ornaments,lllo The Universal Panacea of the Vira1131 and, at the request ofKun tu bzang mo, An Abbreviated Protector Siidhana.1132 When returning from the restoration of the Svayambhu Stupa in Nepal around 1504, he wrote texts for the appendix to the Aural Transmission ma-nual.11n Finally, while residing in Chu bar, gTsang smyon made the neces-sary corrections in a twelve-volume version of his Aural Transmission com-pilation, and he also added some information to the biographies of Tilopa 1122 N: J7a: fnga brgya 'i dus su tshe gcig gis sangs rgyas sgrub pa 'i gdams ngag rnams kyi mig gam I lam mkhan Ita bur gyur pa 'dis kyang I bka' rgyud kyi bstan pa nyin mor mdzad pa lafj,s so I.

This means that many of the cen-tral Aural Transmission texts which gTsang smyon composed are still extant, some in the two collections of manuscripts, and some in the archives of the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project. It is noteworthy that no block-print version of gTsang smyon's compila-tion has appeared.

Miscellaneous Works Most of the ritual texts and liturgies that gTsang smyon wrote were included in his great Aural Transmission compilation, but some did not fit in there.1157 It is for instance mentioned that he composed a Hevajra text in Chu bar titled A Daily Practice Text of Hevajra when he was about twenty-six.1158 rGod attributed to Tilopa and Lus med mkha · 'gro 'i gdams pa snyan rgyud rdo rje tshig d!!U were revealed to Tilopa by the c;lakinis. 11'!ii rDorje tshig rkang gi sa bead marig mun set. 1151 gTsang smyon 1971, vol. 2: 17-27.

The names of the latter texts are The Great Praise of Hevajra and A Discourse of Hevajra.1159 Given the fact that Hevajra was gTsang smyon 's yidam it is perhaps pecu-liar that gTsang smyon mainly composed texts related to Cakrasarpvara, the reason for this was probably his strong affiliation with the bKa' brgyud tra-dition and its Aural Transmission. Although Hevajra is important in the bKa' brgyud traditions, it is CakrasaqiVara and Vajrayogini: that are the main yi-dams. It is likely that gTsang smyon himself regarded Hevajra and Cak-rasarpvara as being essentially the same, and that he therefore could use his experience in Hevajra meditation when he wrote about other yidams. gTsang smyon moreover composed a prayer for blessing directed to Mi-larepa. This prayer is called The Treasury of Blessings: A Prayer to the Ven-erable Laughing Vajra11«J and it is included in a compilation of prayers called Accompanying Prayers of the Lineage [of the} Three Doha cycles.1161 The supplication to Milarepa was printed at Ras chung phug under the direc-tion of rGod tshang ras pa.

'byor pa rus pa'i rgyan can in a recent Tibetan edition ofthe text.1167 Since rNa! 'byor pa rus pa'i rgyan can is one of gTsang smyon's epithets, the famous drama came to be attributed to gTsang smyon.1168 Another example is a history of the Cakrasa1pvara tan-tric transmission, entitled An Ancient History of Sal!'vara.1169 According to Dan Martin, gTsang smyon authored this work, but it actually was gTsang smyon's disciple, rGod tshang ras pa, who wrote this text.1170 A further ex-ample of a text that has been attributed to gTsang smyon is a rnam thar about rGod tshang mgon po rdo rje (1189-1258), named The Liberation Account of rGyal ba rGod tshang mGon po rdo rje: A Rosmy of Jewels which is Meaningful to Behold.1111 But this is a mistake.

In this section, an over-view of some of these texts and their contents will be given. The most inter-esting texts to look at for this study are perhaps those written about and by rGod tshang ras pa and Lha btsun, who composed two of the main sources upon which this study is based. They were both key figures in upholding and propagating \"the school of gTsang smyon\" and they were instrumental in compiling and printing texts. Although both rGod tshang ras pa and Lha btsun merit a specialized study in their own right, a short overview of their life and works will give us a wider context about gTsang smyon and his tra-dition. When surveying their life stories the focus will be devoted to sections that relate to their relation with gTsang smyon. Then we will take a brief look at some other relevant figures and texts. The Life and Works of rGod tshang ras pa rGod tshang ras pa (1482-1559)1175 was, together with Lha btsun Rin chen mam rgyal, one of gTsang smyon's most well-known and important disci-ples. In the few drawings of him that have been preserved he looks similar to gTsang smyon. According to the drawings, both of them kept their long hair in a topknot, and had large earrings and bone ornaments. There is a small block-print illustration of rGod tshang ras pa at the end of the Heart of the Sun. In this picture rGod tshang ras pa is depicted with a bow and a set of arrows.1176 \"rGod tshang\" means \"vulture's nest\", and \"ras pa\" means \"a cotton clad one\". rGod tshang ras pa is thus a sobriquet, and its meaning is the \"Cotton-Clad One from the Vulture's nest\" Apart from this name he is 1175 There has been some con!iJsion regarding the identity and dates of rGod tshang ras pa, and he has sometimes been contl ated with other masters with similar names who lived in the same period. This has been discussed by Ehrhard, forthcoming c; Roberts 2007: 44; Semesi 2007 b: 8. Franz-Karl Ehrhard has recently more or less resolved these problems, and he proposes that the dates were 1482-1559, Ehrhard, forthcoming c. 176 See Figure 25 (p. 226) and G: 287. The bow and arrow are symbols that are found among several Indian siddhas that served as role models for rGod tshang ras pa and gTsang smyon. Saraha is often depicted with an arrow, and according to his life stories he worked as a fletch-er. Another siddha, Savaripa, was a hunter, and the hunting theme is also sometimes found among Tibetan masters. For example, Ra Nam mkha' dpal bzang (Ra smyon, 1398-1425) was a hunter, and 'Brug pa kun legs is often depicted with a bow, arrows, and a hunting dog (Stein 1972: 9). A small painting of rGod tshang ras pa is included among the twenty-nine figures that surround a 16'h century thanka of Amitayus. In this picture he appears almost identical to gTsang smyon who is also depicted on the thanka. Both have long hair, a kharvanga, a skullcup and a vajra And they are both sitting semi cross-legged with meditation belts.

The latter seem to be his proper name and it is often used together with rGod tshang ras pa, thus we have rGod tshang ras pa sNa tshogs rang grol. rGod tshang ras pa wrote a short (8 folio) undated autobiography (rang rnam) in verse entitled the Life Story in Verse of the Lord of Yogins rGod tshang ras chen which is an Ocean of Accomplishments .1178 According to the autobiography, rGod tshang ras pa was born in the village of Lha ruin Yar lung.1179 It is also stated in the text that he belonged to a noble caste and that his clan was mGos. rGod tshang ras pa was the eldest of seven children, and he was born when his father, bSam rdor, was twenty-five and his mother, rDo rje bu khrid, was nineteen. The birth occurred on the tenth day of a Ti-ger year, and although the rnam thar does not mention which Tiger year, it has now been more or less resolved that rGod tshang ras pa was born in 1482.1180 rGod tshang ras pa was an exceptional child and he was born with a yogic gaze while uttering the sacred syllables A and HUM. As a child he always thought about the sad fact that everyone has to die, and he had no interest in engaging in worldly activities. According to his autobiography, rGod tshang ras pa never had a non-religious thought, and as a child he amused himself by performing monastic dances, bestowing empowerrnents and teaching dharma. He learned to read and write without being taught, and could re-member all the teachings and stories that he heard. rGod tshang ras pa's childhood thus resembled the childhoods of many other great masters, and his unusual behavior proved that he had practised Buddhism in many previ-ous lives. He stayed with his mother until he was five and then they moved to a place not far from his birthplace called Vulture's Nest (rGod tshang) in rKyam yul.1181 When he was eight years old (1489) he heard about gTsang smyon for the first time: \"A tea-merchant who had been to Lhasa said, 'There was a yogin, 1177 Duma 'i minglmtshan can. 11781 will call it An Ocean ofAccomplishments.ln the Bibliography it is listed as rGod tshang ras pa sNa tshogs rang grol, rNa/ 'b yor gyi dbang phyug rgod tshang ras chen pa 'i rnam thar tshigs bead ma dngos grub kyi rgya mtsho.

In the following years rGod tshang ras pa received many teachings and empowerments ·from various teachers, some of whom were his own rela-tives.1183 When rGod tshang ras pa was fourteen some mendicants arrived, and he ran away from home disguised as a mentally disabled person}184 While traveling he met a learned master called Shel dkar who gave him or-dination, and he was given the name Byams pa Shakya dpal bzang. ••as rGod tshang ras pa continued his studies and received more teachings. He also did retreats and gained first-hand experience of what he had studied. On one occasion a yogin named rTog ldan rin (-chen) arrived where he was studying, and spoke of gTsang smyon. rGod tshang ras pa once again was profoundly affected when hearing about gTsang smyon. Because [rTog ldan rin] made an excellent proclamation of the life story [and] deeds of the actual Vajradhara, the Dharma Lord, the Jina of the three realms-gTsang smyon Heruka-l became settled in an unconscious state similar to madness. The appearances of this life fell apart completely and i thought that I had to end my studies and leave the very next day.1186 rGod tshang ras pa then asked the teacher with whom he was studying, dGe 'phel chos phel, for permission to leave and search for gTsang smyon. His teacher told him that the experience he had had was an obstacle that should be ignored. rGod tshang ras pa therefore stayed, but he felt deep regret and sadness for having obeyed his teacher, or to use his own words, he felt \"like one lacking a ferry at the river bank\". 1187 rGod tshang ras pa then went for a pilgrimage to the holy Tsliri and while traveling he met another famous smyon pa, dBus smyon Kun dga' bzang po, at bKra shis sgang.

While engaged in intense practice, he once again was overcome by an unbearably strong longing for the Dharma Lord, gTsang smyon.1189 He asked for permission to search for him, and this time his request was granted.1190 Very happy, on the full-moon day the year 1500, he left his teacher and relatives who came to bid him farewell. After a long j oumey, in the spring 15 01, he reached Chu bar where gTsang smyon was on a three-year retreat for the benefit of others before restoring the Svayambhu Stupa.1191 It was during this period that rGod tshang ras pa met gTsang smyon for the first time.

He dwelled at many famous places frequented by yogins for meditation practice, such as La phyi, rDzong drug (The Six Forts), Chu bar, Tsiiri, Kong po, Yo! roo and Zab lung.1194 rGod tshang ras pa lived a long and active life. After gTsang smyon's passing, he devoted much time and energy to disseminating and upholding the teachings he had received from him. In Treasury of Oral Instructions he is mentioned as the lineage holder of two of the main teaching transmissions of gTsang smyon, namely the Aural Transmission of Saqwara and the Qiikinis and the Four Letter Mahiimudrii.1195 A few of his many teachers are enumerated at the end of An Ocean of Accomplishments, and in addition to gTsang smyon and his female partner Kun tu bzang roo, the famous Sa skya pa scholar Siikya mchog !dan and the Seventh Karma pa Chos grags rgya mtsho are listed.1196 The texts that rGod tshang ras pa composed show that he, like his master, was interested in hagiographies of former bKa' brgyud masters, and also that he had an interest in the Aural Transmissions (snyan brgyud) of the bKa' brgyud tradition. Pictures of him show that he was a yogin, and his name indicates that he was a \"cotton-clad one\"-a ras pa. rGod tshang ras pa's main residence was Ras chung phug, but he also founded a monastery called Island of Vulture's Nese197 in Yol roo, present day Nepal.11911 Moreover, it is recorded in the pilgrimage guide to the old and famous Thundering Falcon temple,1199 which is situated not far from Ras chung phug, that he erected a chapel of the Eleven-Headed Avalokitt:Svara in the Falcon temple.1200 Ras chung phug is situated on the side of a mountain called Lo rna lo ri that separates the Yarlung and the 'Phyongs rgyas valleys, about ten kilome-ters south of rTse thang.1201 Before its destruction, it was a large monastery 1193 G: 208: rje btsun rus pa 'i rgyan cangyi tlmgs sras rnams gyi nang nas tha chung tu gyur fa. 194 An Ocean of Accomplishments: 8a. 1195 bDe mchog mkha' 'gro snyan brgyud and Phyag rgya chen po yi ge bzhi pa.

Many of the practices which they devoted time and energy to practising and disseminating stemmed from Ras chung pa, and the tradition they followed is sometimes even called Ras chung bKa' brgyud. gTsang smyon also passed away at Ras chung phug (the Cave of Ras chung) and Ras chung phug was the main seat of the Aural Transmission ofRas chung pa-Ras clnmg snyan brgyud. Thanks to an autobiography of one of his disciples, Byams pa phun tshogs ( 1503-1581), we know that rOod tshang ras pa passed away in 1559.1205 Ac-1202 Hugh Richardson photographed it when he visited in 1949 and an interesting old photo is contained in Richardson 1998: plate 69. 1203 Batchelor 1987: 255. rGod tshang ras pa appears to have been a very important person in the history of Ras chung phug and his activities contributed to transforming what originally were some small buildings around a cave into an important religious center with a large num-ber of monks. Many texts were printed here, and pilgrims visited from afar to receive teach-ings and empowerments. In his pilgrimage guide to the holy places of central Tibet, mKhyen brtse dbang po (1820-1892) mentions that gTsang smyon had stayed at Ras chung phug, and he also states that many sacred objects were housed there, Ferrari (trans.) 1958: 51. Situ chos kyi rgya mtso (1880-1924) describes Ras chung phug more thoroughly in his guidebook (Situ chos kyi rgya mtsho 1980: 250-251). He mentions that one of the most important statues in Ras chung phug was a life-size statue of gTsang smyon which was adorned with silver skulls, and made by rGod tshang ras pa. He also states that rGod tshang ras pa had erected statues of each lineage holder of the Aural Transmission of Ras chung tradition, and that the temple housed a golden statue of rGod tshang ras pa. Finally he mentions that rGod tshang ras pa's remains were kept in one of the halls of the monastery (Situ chos kyi rgya mtsho 1980: 250-251). 1204 Ras chung phug is described in several Tibet guidebooks, see for example: Batchelor 1987: 255-258; Chang 1994: 347-348; Gyurme Dotje 2004: 203. Unfortunately the guide-books contain some misinformation. gTsang smyon is confuted with gTsang pa rgya ras (1161-1211) both by Chang (1994: 348) and by Batchelor (1987: 258), and Gyurme Dotje, whose guidebook generally is reliable, wrongly asserts tha,t gTsang smyon wrote Mi Ia's life story here (2004: 203). A short description of the place is also found in Richardson 1998: 319-320. Much concise information and many references are also found in Serensen, P.K., Hazed, in Cooperation with Gyalbo, T. 2005: 108, n. 277. Ras chung phug is one of the few places in Tibet where gTsang smyon ~still remembered, and a recently made statue of him is regarded as the most important object of worship in the small cave temple that remains today. The statue was consecrated while Stephen Batchelor visited Ras chung phug in the eighties, and he mentions that it had been brought from Lhasa (Bachelor 1987: 255). Photos of this gTsang smyon statue are reproduced in the section with illustrations, see Figures 2 (p. 258) and 16 (p. 265).

In addition to the rnam thar about Ras chung and the one about his own root lama (gTsang smyon), he also wrote a rnam thar of Lo ras pa dbang phyug brtson 'grus {1187-1250).1209 Together with Kun tu bzang mo and some oth-er disciples he also compiled the above-mentioned collection of gTsang smyon's songs.1210 rGod tshang ras pa also authored texts that are connected with the history, lineage and practices of the Aural Transmission of Cak-rasarnvara that he received from gTsang smyon and other lamas.

Smith states that he \"for a number of reasons, can be regarded as the most significant student of gTsang smyon.\"1216 His importance is at least partly derived hom the fact that he belonged to the royal family ofGung thang.1217 The kings of the Gung thang family were believed to be descendants of the old Tibetan Royal Dy-nasty, and the title \"lha btsun\" means \"Divine Venerable One\". According to Tibetan mythology, the ancient rulers of Tibet were all descended from the gods, and Lha btsun was therefore regarded as a divine person already at birth. Smith moreover mentions that Lha btsun was considered to be the rebirth of a disciple ofBo dong phyogs las mam rgyal (1376--1451), named Kun dga' rgyal mtshan of sGang dkar ba who was the abbot of mTho !ding in Gu ge.121M Lha btsun was thus exalted in both a worldly and spiritual sense, and his high position is also reflected by the many important and famous teachers that he had.1219 gTsang smyon became his most important teacher, however, and Lha btsun in tum contributed to gTsang smyon's fame by ac-tively promoting him and his lineage. Lha btsun's fame and importance led to the composition of at least two biographies about him, and several artisans made statues of him. 1220 He is thus the disciple of gTsang smyon about whom we know the most, and he is also the subject of a forthcoming doctoral dissertation.1221 1215 dPal 'khor Ia sdom pa sngon gyur Ia rgyus. The work is mentioned in Schaeffer, forth-coming. As mentioned above this text has sometimes been wrongly attributed to gTsang sm1on. 121 Smith 2001: 75. 1217 According to Smith (2001: 75), Lha btsun was the son of the ruler of Gung thang, Khri rNam rgyallde (1422-1502). Everding states that Lha btsun seem to have been confused with the son of the elder son of this ruler, Nor bu Ide (1450-1484). This son's name is Lha btsun kun dga' mam rgyal, and Everding holds it to be very likely that Lha btsun rin chen mam rgyal and Lha btsun kun dga' mam rgyal have been conflated due to the likeness of their names and due to the fact that they had the same title (Everding 2000: 548-549, n. 1412). Exactly how Lha btsun is related to the royal family thus remains to be resolved. The only information about Lha btsun's parents in the life stories is that his mother was the daughter of the elder brother of Kun dga' rgyal mtshan (Life and Songs of Lha btsun 1976: 284). 1m Smith 2001: 75. 1219 Smith lists some of his teachers (Smith 200 I: 75). 1220 A statue of Lha btsun from Brag dkar rta so is reproduced in Steams 2000: 15.

The latter text could be the second part of this text. However, Smith is inclined to believe that the text is the second part (smad cha) of a rnam thar in two parts, and that the first part (stod cha) exists but has not yet come to light.1228 Although both these texts provide much information about Lha btsun, it is the Life and Songs of Lha btsun that contains the most information about gTsang smyon.

The following day Lha btsun went to gTsang smyon who asked him if he could see the mind and Lha btsun answered: \"One cannot see the mind by looking with one's own [mind].\" \"Why not?\" [gTsang smyon] asked. \"Like it is said in sPyod 'jug:1236 'A sharp knife cannot cut itself.'

He also told Lha btsun to study with other teachers for nine or ten years, and then return to him.1239 While Lha btsun was studying with other teachers, gTsang smyon's mother passed away and he traveled to his homeland to conduct ceremonies for her.1240 Lha btsun heard that gTsang smyon and sixty followers stayed 1231 L· 98· G· 139 1232 A~co~di~g to ~he colophon of Milarepa's rnam rhar it was completed in a year called phur bu.

Although Lha btsun had already received the teachings that gTsang smyon gave, gTsang smyon told him that he should listen one more time, since repetition is helpful. After about a month Lha btsun engaged in a religious debate and defeated everyone who debated with him. When Don yod rdo rje heard about Lha btsun's great debating skill and the depth of his learning he became very happy and said: \"A son is born from a good father\"}242 When it was time to leave, gTsang smyon asked Lha btsun if he wanted to follow him, but Lha btsun felt that he needed to continue the studies that he had interrupted. gTsang smyon said: \"Study whatever mantra teaching you can without partiality to any particular tenets (grub mtha '). At some point you will feel disgust towards the appearances of this life; at that time, don't give in to the influence of circumstances but come to my place, [your] fa-ther.\"1243 After having said this he gave [Lha btsun] two packets of tea and left.

To sixty especially fortunate disciples he gave direct instruc-tions on the Six Dharmas of Naropa based on his own experience. He also taught them yogic exercises. When spring came he granted the assembled disciples the complete reading transmission (lung) ofthe Aural Transmission of the Qakinis.1249 After this, in the autumn, Lha btsun returned to his birthplace, Thang po che, to gather offerings. When the winter came, Lha btsun went to gTsang smyon again and offered him various offerings. For a period of seven months he stayed with gTsang smyon, who took care of him with love and gave him complete instructions (bka' hmg).1250 When staying with his guru he was without any fatigue and was unaffected by heat, cold, hunger or thirst, according to the text. Lha btsun held the instructions that he received as dearer to him than his own eyes and practised them earnestly. One time gTsang smyon held a roll of paper covered in brocade in his folded hands. Inside the roll were oral instructions and Lha btsun said that he needed to obtain them. \"By all means I will give you all of them,\" gTsang smyon an-swered.1251 Then Lha btsun received \"pointing out instructions\" (ngo sprod) and after that he was given all the instructions of the uncommon Aural Transmission. Then gTsang smyon said: 1246 Life and Songs of Lha btsun 1976: 302. 1247 Life and songs of Lha btsun 1976: 303. rGod tshang ras pa mentions that the son of a king, Lha btsun rin chen mam rgyal had completed his studies of the Ri bo dga' !dan pa tradi-tion in bKra shis !hun po and came at this time. After having received profound instructions from gTsang smyon he became his heart-son (thugs sras) (G: 198). This has sometimes been interpreted as if Lha btsun became gTsang smyon's disciple at this point (see, for example, Smith 2001: 66; Steams [Kalnins]I985: 37). But, as seen above, this assumption is not con-firmed by the Life and Songs of Lha btsun. There is, however, no contradiction between rGod tshang ras pa's account and the account given in Life and Songs of Lha btsun, but what is stated in the texts is simply that it was at this point Lha btsun's status as an ordinary disciple changed, and he became gTsang smyon's heart-son, in other words he became one of his closest disciples. 12'1\" Ufe and songs ofLha btsun 1976: 303.

Like his guru (gTsang smyon) and his dharma brother (rOod tshang ras pa), Lha btsun was a very prolific author, and he published no less than twenty-eight works, totaling over fifteen hundred folios.1253 As has been mentioned, Lha btsun's main seat was Brag dkar rta so, a holy place where Milarepa had meditated, and rOod tshang ras pa's main seat was Ras chung phug. It was at these two places that most of their printing activities took place. While Lha btsun focused on songs, life stories and teachings derived from Milarepa, rOod tshang ras pa mainly devoted his time and energy to biographies, songs and teachings that came from Ras chung pa. Ras chung phug became the main center of the lineage of Ras chung. There rOod tshang ras pa compiled and printed exten-sive rnam thars of Ras chung and focused his writing on the Aural Trans-mission lineages (sNyan brgyud). Lha btsun on the other hand mainly com-piled and printed rnam thars of Milarepa and wrote extensively on Mahamudra. 1254 Lha btsun made new prints of the rnam thar and mgur 'bum of Milarepa that gTsang smyon had compiled in Brag dkar rta so.1255 He also compiled two texts on Milarepa himself. 1256 These two texts are comprised of materials that were not included in gTsang smyon 's famous compilations and bear the titles, Six Vajra Songs and Other Miscellaneous Writings of the Oral Tradi-tions of the Venerable Milarepa1257 and The Uncommon Vajra Songs.ms The 1152 Life and songs ofLha btsun 1976: 306: khyod Ia pha nga'i gdarn ngag gang yod /hag ma rna Ius par byin pa yin pas I nga narn 'das kyi bar du su Ia 'ang rna zer I de nas kyang khyod rang Ia 'chi ras pa 'i na tsha gsurn rna byung gi bar du rni gzhan Ia bgros rna gtong I de nas {qf3 can gyi slob rna Ia s!J!!I gang thub gyis gsung ba 'i bka' rgyas btab bo I.

Schaeffer mentions that no place or date are mentioned in the rnarn thar, but he is almost certain that it is a Brag dkar rta so print. 1156 It is beyond the scope of this dissertation to make a conclusive list of all Lha btsun's works, and a few examples will have to be enough. For more about Lha btsun's literary pro-duction, see the essays by Gene Smith and Kurtis Schaeffer.

Guenther translated it into English.1262 Another work of Lha btsun that has also been translated is the songs ofKo rag pa bsod nams rgyal mtshan ( 1170-1249).1263 Besides hagiographies and song collections, Lha btsun wrote texts on Mahamudra. Three works of this kind are known.1264 The longest is a fifty-folio commentary on the Four Letter Mahamudra titled: A Commentary of the Four Letter Mahlimudrti which shows the Main Intention ofTantra.1265 Following in the footsteps of gTsang smyon, Lha btsun also undertook a renovation of the Svayambhu StOpa in Nepal. The stlipa had been damaged by invading Turks and needed to be repaired. Therefore, gTsang smyon ap-peared in a vision and requested Lha btsun to repair the StOpa. Lha btsun complied with his guru's request and started the renovation in 1530. Proba-bly due to meager funds he did not complete the renovation until almost ten years later.1266 The Life of bSod nams blo gros There is also a life story about a lesser-known disciple of gTsang smyon named bSod nams blo gros (ca. 1460-1541).

Sha ra ba belonged to the khyung po clan and he had five siblings. Like other great masters-to-be, his religious inclination amazed those who saw him, and when he was only three years old, he gave teachings.1278 When he was older, a need to renounce samsara arose, and at thirteen Sha ra ba entered a monastic community. As a young monk, he studied the Buddhist teachings in a systematic and gradual way. Starting with the Tripi~aka, Yi-naya, Abhidharma and Siitra, he soon mastered Pramal).a and Madhyamaka, as well.

Other Sources In addition to the persons that had a direct relationship with gTsang smyon it is also possible to find information about persons who were disciples or as-sociates not of gTsang smyon, but of gTsang smyon 's disciples and teachers. An interesting text of this kind is a rnam thar of the above-mentioned Byams pa phun tshogs.

This shows us that gTsang smyon was respected cen-turies after his death.1293 In a guide to the sKu 'bum inthong ba rang grol sto.pa in Sikkim written by Lha btsun Nam mkha' 'jigs med ( 1597-1653) it is mentioned that the loincloths (ang ra) of gTsang smyon and dBus smyon were among the many consecrated substances (dam rdzas) and blessing bestowing objects of wor-ship (rten byin brlabs can) inside the stilpa.1294 gTsang smyon is sometimes mentioned in Tibetan guidebooks that were written for pilgrims, and some of these books have been studied and/or translated.

It would be interesting to read more critical accounts, which disagree with, or at least moderates the panegyric voices of his devotees. It is possible that critical, or more neutral, accounts of gTsang smyon exist.

Nowadays, his legacy mainly continues through his own and his disciples' literary efforts which, contrary to his persona and transmission lineage, have continued to receive much attention.1301 The texts that were produced and printed by \"the School of gTsang smyon\" have con-tinued to spread his message in the world. gTsang smyon's agenda seems to have been to promote a more ascetic and meditative way for Buddhist practi-tioners. instead of the monk-scholar, it was the yogin, and particularly the accomplished one-the siddha-that was his ideal. By means of compiling, printing and distributing life stories, gTsang smyon and his disciples pro-moted sides of Buddhism that sometimes tend to be forgotten, namely re-nunciation and meditation practice. Moreover they emphasized that it was possible to obtain enlightenment by means of advanced tantric practice. There is often a critique of scholar-monks (dge bshes) in both the life sto-ries that gTsang smyon wrote/compiled and in the rnam thars about him. This critique should not be misunderstood, however. It is important to re-member that gTsang smyon is presented as a scholar with a monastic back-ground. Also his teacher, Sha ra rab 'byams pa, is portrayed as having been a monk-scholar before embarking upon the path of a tantric yogin, and we have seen that gTsang smyon encouraged his disciple, Lha btsun, to study in famous non-bKa' brgyud institutions. The critique is thus not aimed at stud-ies and monasticism as such, but at the tendency among some monks to ne-not gTsang smyon's lineage and person have not disappeared completely, however. When 1 visited Tibet in 2006 I heard about a master named Ngag dbang don grub who had passed away in 2003 (not far from gTsang smyon's birthplace in mKhar kha). According to some monks of dPal 'khor chos sde, this master was considered to be an emanation (sprul pa) of gTsang smyon. Moreover, a seventy-three year old monk whom I met in a village below Ras chung phug told me that the ninth incarnation (sprnl sku) of gTsang smyon, 'Jam dpal kun bzang nam sprul rgya mtsho, recently passed away in Gro mo, a county situated close to the Sikkimese and Bhutanese border. I also recently found out that a lama named Byang glmg Rinpoche who lives in Nepal belongs to an incarnation line which is linked to gTsang smyon. The first Byang gling incarnation was a student of rGod tshang ras pa named rGod phrug pa Sangs rgyas rdo tje, and he was believed to be an incarnation of gTsang smyon (http://lotusspeach.org.au/teacher0. gTsang smyon's lineage was also upheld by the great ris med master mKhyen rtse dbang po (I 82()... I 892) and another ris med master, 'Jam mgon kong sprul, included some texts from gTsang smyon's lineage in his Treasury of Oral Instructions collection (gDams ngag mdzod). 246"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"glect practice and engage in worldly pursuits. gTsang smyon, as he is pre-sented by his disciples, does in fact seem to claim that monasticism and stud-ies are necessary foundations for tantric practice. According to the rnam thars, the scholar-monks with whom gTsang smyon sometimes debated mis-used Buddhism and failed to see gTsang smyon's qualities. What appears to have been debated between gTsang smyon and the dge bshes concerned how and when certain tantric practices should be carried out. The rnam thars about gTsang smyon include several episodes where learned scholars, often dge bshes, questioned his behavior and way of dressing. They said that his way of practising did not correspond with the Buddhist teachings. gTsang smyon surprised his antagonists by giving precise and accurate explanations, and he often quoted appropriate texts at length. According to the life stories, the dge bshes were thus not as learned as gTsang smyon, and while the scho-lars who questioned him ended up speechless and embarrassed, those who witnessed the encounters were impressed and filled with faith in gTsang smyon. Besides showing that gTsang smyon's learning exceeded that of everyone else the authors of the rnam thars also depict him as the yogin par excellance. The texts describe how gTsang smyon meditated for years in remote caves just like Milarepa, and indeed, he so thoroughly identified him-selfwith the cotton-clad yogin, that he eventually came to be regarded as his emanation. This leads us to another important facet of gTsang smyon, namely his promotion of ancient bKa' brgyud doctrines, practices and ideals. gTsang smyon appears to have been a bKa' brgyud purist who avoided mixing the bKa' brgyud lineage that he practised and disseminated with other lineages. His faithfulness to the tradition of Milarepa, which he had received from his root-lama Sha ra rab 'byams pa, is exemplified by his overt interest in the life stories and the Aural Transmissions of the early bKa' brgyud masters. Milarepa's disciple Ras chung pa had an important place in the Aural Transmissions of the bKa' brgyud tradition, and he differs from Milarepa's today more famous disciple sGam po pa in several ways. While sGam po pa is portrayed as a learned and well-disciplined bKa' gdams pa monk, Ras chung pa is presented as a lay tantric yogin, and his rebelliousness is often stressed. Although it is sGam po pa's version of the bKa' brgyud that be-came successful and was spread through Tibet and elsewhere, Ras chung pa and other lay tantric yogins could arguably be seen as being closer to the founders of the tradition. sGam po pa blended the monastic bKa' gdams tradition with its emphasis on mind training and siltric Mahayana Buddhism with the tantric yogic teachings of Milarepa. Ras chung pa, on the other hand, appears to have continued to practise the tantric and yogic teachings of Milarepa without mixing them with teachings taken from other lineages, and like Milarepa, he is portrayed as being uninterested in monasticism and insti-tutions. While the four \"greater\" and eight \"lesser\" bKa' brgyud schools that derived from sGam po pa's disciples became institutionalized and widely 247"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"disseminated, Ras chung's transmission lineage remained obscure and un-institutionalized. It seems that gTsang smyon wanted to revive this alterna-tive, and arguably more original, bKa' brgyud lineage with its focus on yo-gic practice and wilderness retreats. At the same time gTsang smyon seems to have been aware of the importance of receiving acceptance and support from the institutionalized bKa' brgyud branches. He therefore appears to have downplayed the polemic and problematic sides of the early bKa' brgyud masters. This was perhaps a part of the secret behind the success of the life stories that gTsang smyon and his disciples composed. Their life stories were close to the life of ordinary people and at the same time possible for the monastic orders to accept. gTsang smyon's ability to balance between the provocative and the normative is mirrored both in his religious and his worldly activities. It is to the latter that we will now tum. The general situation in Tibet, both during and directly after gTsang smyon's life-time (when the rnam thars about him were composed), is an important factor that should be taken into consideration when studying his life. Although this study has focused on how religious/Buddhist practices and doctrines can explain gTsang smyon's mad way of conduct, the socio-political situation should also be considered when trying to understand his \"madness\". Tibet was fragmented during the 15th and 161h centuries, and many conflicts and wars were going on. At the same time this was a dynamic and creative period when many different forms of Buddhism co-existed and influenced one another. Religion, art, architecture and literature flourished, and gTsang smyon was involved in many cultural enterprises. He skillfully utilized his position as a mad yogin, and he seems to have been able tore-main outside of both religious and political factions. This in turn enabled him to act independently and avoid becoming involved in religious and po-litical conflicts. gTsang smyon's position seems to have implied a freedom of movement and expression that he put to good use. The hagiographies describe how he, by means of outrageous behavior and a display of miracu-lous powers, obtained patronage from many different leaders and support from various Buddhist traditions. It is an interesting paradox that an outsider who promoted asceticism, renunciation and meditation had so many patro~s and supporters. According to the life stories, he was supported by bKra shts dar rgyas of By a yul; Don yod rdo xje of Rin spungs (and indeed of large parts of Tibet); dPal 'byor rgyal po of sNe'u rdzong; Nam mkha' stob rgyal of Tsha mda'; Nam mkha' rdo rje of Lha stod byang; the king of Kath-mandu, Ratnamalla; the ruler of gLo bo smon thang, bKra shis mgon; the king ofGung thang, Khri roam rgyallde; his two sons, prince Norbu Ide and prince bSam grub Ide; and others. gTsang smyon 's position as a mad yogin seems to have made it possible for him both to express criticism and to remain neutral without getting into trouble. According to the life stories, he sometimes acted as a mediator in conflicts and thereby managed to reconcile rival disputing parties and also 248"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"avoid wars. At other times he boldly criticized leaders who he thought had acted wrongly. Apparently it was both accepted and expected that a mad yogin was outspoken and honest. It appears to have been an integral part of his role to transgress social, political and religious boundaries, and this en-abled him to do and say things that others could not do and say. The life of a mad yogin thus involved certain advantages in 15th -16111 cen-tury Tibet. While the scholar-monks were geographically and historically linked with particular places and rulers, the wandering mad yogins were more flexible. According to the hagiographies gTsang smyon obtained sup-port and patronage from several different leaders, although many of these leaders were in conflict with one another. The wandering life-style of the mad yogins made it possible for them to move to other places if wars and conflicts afflicted a certain area, and having several patrons meant that if one patron lost his power and influence they could go to another. Moreover, since monasteries and property could be coveted, confiscated, or perhaps destroyed by hostile or envious competitors, the possession of monasteries and property could lead to problems and dangers.u02 A mad yogin also fol-lowed a different discipline and was therefore not bound by the monastic rules of conduct. He or she could therefore talk and act in ways that were not allowed for the monks. At times, this difference could perhaps also be an advantage. The life stories of gTsang smyon show how his provocative and mad be-havior was performed in a deliberate and strategic way. gTsang smyon dis-played \"madness\" to reasons similar to why he displayed miraculous powers, namely to impress and convert others. It is interesting that this rather unusual conversion strategy often worked. gTsang smyon constantly gained new followers and patrons as a result of his mad behavior. It is evident that gTsang smyon's provocative and crazy behavior was performed when many people had gathered. He repeatedly acted as a madman in front of important kings and leaders when they had gathered together with many followers and spectators. \"Disciplined conduct\" was a social event and his spectacular behavior made him famous. It is noteworthy that mad practices sometimes are performed in the rNying rna tradition under quite different circum-stances. Instead of acting like a madman in public, the rNying rna pa yogin who practises the extraordinary preliminary practices that lead to \"direct transcendence\" (thad rgaf), behaves as if mad within a communal retreat 1302 An example of this is found in the life story of the mad yogin 'Brug pa kun legs. Accord-ing to his life story, 'Bnrg pa kun legs had seen how possessions and position caused prob-lems and disasters around him. His father, who was a governor (nang so), had been killed in a conllict, and then when he served the leader of the Rin spungs estate, Kun tu bzang po, he again witnessed war and conflicts. 'Brug pa kun legs became depressed and when he was rcqm:stcd to stay at Ra lung he declined and said that dealing with possessions in these degen-erate times leads to disaster in the short run and to hdl in the long run. Instead, he became a wandering mad yogin ('Brug pa kun legs 2005: 5; Stein J<J72: 43-44). 249"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"setting, and under the close guidance of a spiritual guide.1303 gTsang smyon on the other hand, acted mad in public, and people who had witnessed his outrageous behavior and his bizarre way of dressing did not forget him. For example, rGod tshang ras pa heard about gTsang smyon from a tea-merchant who had encountered a yogin named gTsang smyon who wore a human skin when he was in Lhasa. This report made the eight-year-old rGod tshang ras pa curious. Due to his karmic link with gTsang smyon he became filled with faith, and a wish to meet with the mad yogin in person arose. Not unlike some present-day artists who become famous by dressing and acting in un-usual and shocking ways, gTsang smyon became famous and obtained pa-tronage and supporters as a result of his mad and transgressive actions. It is interesting that gTsang smyon's \"madness\" often gave rise to faith and devo-tion among the people who witnessed it. This indicates that Tibetans in the 15th and 161h centuries were aware of, and prepared for, mad behavior by Buddhist masters. The fact that gTsang smyon's disciples wrote about these crazy activities in the hagiographies, and the fact that the epithet \"mad\" is used for him and other masters almost like an honorific title, show that the Tibetans believed that a great master may act as if mad. Another factor that also seems to be at work is the hope and fear that peo-ple felt when they encountered a mad yogin. According to the life stories, people became rewarded with riches and fortune as a result of showing re-spect and having faith in gTsang smyon, while the consequences of not re-specting him could be fatal. People who encountered a mad yogin thus had much to win if they showed him respect, and they had much to lose if they did not. Despite the importance of social and political aspects, this dissertation has focused upon how the transgressive, provocative, and outright crazy ways of the mad yogins could be explained by means of Buddhist doctrines and/or practices. There are several examples in the life stories that show how gTsang smyon referred to tantric Buddhist doctrines and practices when his unusual behavior was questioned. In these tantric texts it is explained how, by whom, when, and why, a transgressive and seemingly mad practice should be carried out. What at first glance seems to be a spontaneous, hap-hazard, and uncontrolled conduct is thus actually a particular Buddhist prac-tice-a practice, which should only be undertaken by the right person, at the right time, in the right way and for the right reasons. Otherwise, the result will be disastrous, both for the practitioner and for others, according to the tantric exegetes. The practices that the mad yogins performed are explained in great detail in the Mahayoga and Yoginitantras (which the Tibetans refer to as Anuttarayogatantras) and their commentaries. These types of tantras were incorporated into the newer Tibetan schools (gsar ma) to which the bKa' brgyud tradition belongs. 1303 For a description of these practices, see Germano 1997: 311-334. 250"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"The most commonly used terms for practices that involve transgressive and sometimes crazy behavior are vrata (brtul zhugs) and caryii (spyod pa), often combined as vratacaryii (brtul zhugs spyod pa). There is a precise de-scription of what inner realizations a yogin must have attained before under-taking these practices, and it is prescribed how such a person should dress and act. A practitioner \"enters into the conduct\" (spyod pa fa 'jug pa) when he has reached the second of the five paths-\"the path of connection\" (sbyor lam). The inner sign that indicates that he has obtained this level of realiza-tion is that he experiences \"warmth\" (drod) and another sign of having reached this attainment is that the yogin no longer cares about the eight worldly dharmas. According to the hagiographies about gTsang smyon, his first display of unconventional and \"mad\" conduct already occurred while he was studying with Sha ra rab 'byams pa, and it was preceded by an experi-ence of\"warmth\". It is also often stressed that he did not care about the eight worldly concerns. Tantric exegetes, moreover, often stress that a practitioner who aspires to perform these practices must have compassion, a firm back-ground in basic Buddhism, and have kept the priitimok~a vows, the Bodhi-sattva vows and especially the tantric commitments (samaya). Tantric exe-getes thus emphasize that the mad conduct is a part of \"normative\" Bud-dhism. The mad yogins of Tibet are often called grub thob (siddha), and given their close resemblance to the Indian siddhas, the designation is indeed suit-able. Many of the Indian siddhas behaved in unconventional ways, and like the mad yo gins of Tibet, they practised and disseminated the Anuttarayoga-tantras. These tantras are generally centered on a particular type of wrathful deities called herukas. gTsang smyon's practice was focused on two such wrathful deities, namely Hevajra and Cakrasarnvara. Hevajra was his main yidam (i~[adevatii), and he devoted much of his time and energy to compil-ing and disseminating the Aural Transmission of Cakrasarp.vara. Buddhist Tantric practice involves the visualization of tantric deities and recitation of mantras. There are two phases of tantric sadhana meditation, the generation and the completion phases. During the first phase the practitioner visualizes, and gradually attempts to identifY himself with the tantric deity (yidam), which in gTsang smyon's case was Hevajra. When the completion stage practices occur, the yogin is no longer supposed to have any notion of being separated from his yidam. In fact, tantric exegetes claim that the yidam and the practitioner have always been inseparably united, but due to his igno-rance the practitioner has been unaware of this. The practice is thus a means to realize that the practitioner has lived in a deluded state of mind and then to transform this deluded state into a non-deluded, or awakened state. The yi-dam is an expression of awakened mind, and there are peaceful, as well as wrathful yidams. The heruka is a wrathful yidam, but ultimately every ex-pression of awakening is the same, regardless of how different they may appear. gTsang smyon's yidam was Hevajra, and Hcvajra is a hcruka, so 251"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"when gTsang smyon became enlightened he realized or discovered his own mind as Hevajra/heruka. It is somewhat paradoxical that the seemingly undisciplined and uncon-trolled behavior of the mad yogin is actually prescribed in the tantras and thus is a type of \"disciplined conduct\" (vratacaryii). A yogin who practises \"disciplined conduct\" is supposed to act without restraint and say and do whatever appears in his mind.1304 Such a practitioner should not show any preferences concerning what is suitable or unsuitable, pure or impure, good or bad, and so forth, but completely let go of all dualistic and self-centered ideas. In this way, he displays his realization of the empty nature of all phe-nomena. Experiencing everything as \"one taste\", the yogin realizes that sam-sara is nirvana. This realization enables the practitioner to do things that would be disastrous for an ordinary person. When gTsang smyon was about twenty years old he had a transformative visionary encounter with his yidam Hevajra which inspired him to behave in unconventional and provocative ways. Since his \"crazy\" ways were unsuitable for a monk, he left his monas-tery. It is stressed in the rnam thars that he had mastered basic Buddhism, Mahayana and Mantrayana completely at this point, and it is also stated that he was extremely learned. Later he went to Tsari where he received the four empowerments in their entirety from Hevajra in another visionary encounter. On that occasion He-vajra gave him his secret name Khrag thung rgyal po-\"king of the blood drinkers\"-a Tibetan translation of heruka. gTsang smyon was now an \"en-lightened\" siddha and a heruka. His status as a heruka had been confirmed by the visions, and his new status was displayed outwardly by the way he dressed and acted. He adorned himself with the \"six heruka bone orna-ments\"; carried a tantric staff (kha{Vtiilga), and a skull-cup (kapiila); and practised \"disciplined conduct\" (brtul zhugs spyod pa). According to the rnam thars, he did this for the sake of benefiting the doctrine and the living beings. Following these transformative experiences, during a period of about ten years, gTsang smyon repeatedly acted in very provocative and \"crazy\" ways. He stayed at cemeteries, draped himself in intestines, ate from leprous corpses, destroyed religious ceremonies, took the beverages of kings and leaders from their hands and drank it, insulted people, threw around urine and feces, drank his own urine, and sexually assaulted people, and so forth. As seen above, it is possible to explain even such antinomian and transgres-sive acts by means of Buddhist doctrines and practices. Unconventional and apparently mad ways of conduct could be associated both with the path to-wards accomplishment and also with the goal, namely accomplishment it-self. \"Disciplined conduct\" could be applied by the advanced tantric practi-1304 Whether the tantras are to be interpreted symbolically or not is, of course, a debated and problematic issue. 252"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"tioner to enhance his progress upon the path towards awakening, and when the goal has been attained, the practitioner resembles a mad person insofar that his perception of the world is completely different from that of an ordi-nary person. An enlightened master no longer perceives things in a dualistic and self-centered manner, and might therefore appear to be mad in the eyes the world. It is also noteworthy that the antinomian and transgressive actions that gTsang smyon performed are possible to explain with the help of Mahayana doctrines. The disciples of gTsang smyon repeatedly emphasize that he nev-er harmed others, but that all his actions, however bizarre and shocking they may appear, always benefited sentient beings and the Buddhist teachings. gTsang smyon's mad ways are described as a method (thabs) that enabled him to help beings of a rough nature who would never have listened to tradi-tional Buddhist teachings. When attacked by angry people he shed tears, not because of personal pain, but out of compassion for the people who assaulted him. When he met traders who had captured a woman and her daughters whom they were about to sell, he felt intense compassion, bought them free, and escorted them· back to their homes. Thu'u bkwan bLo bzang Chos kyi nyi rna states that although gTsang smyon abided in \"disciplined conduct\" and was a siddha who controlled all outer appearances his wisdom-mind was filled only with love and compassion whenever he encountered an unfortu-nate being who suffered, or someone who had accumulated negative karma. gTsang smyon made the suffering beings the principal focus of his practice, and although gTsang smyon had attained an exalted level of accomplish-ment, he strongly emphasized the importance of karma and its result. Thu'u' bkwan moreover states, that gTsang smyon considered even the smallest virtuous or harmful action to be of the utmost importance, and that this was what he always taught his disciples.1305 Sometimes it appears to have been a conscious strategy of gTsang smyon to shock people in order to \"wake them up\" from their ignorance. Although Buddhist masters are sometimes seen as cozy figures who do whatever is needed to make people comfortable and happy, it is important to remember that Buddhism aims at \"waking\" people up, and if people are \"sleeping\" deeply it might be impossible to wake them up without employing unusual and perhaps even uncomfortable methods. These kinds of unexpected and shocking actions are found in several Buddhist traditions; the Chan (Zen) and siddha traditions in particular abound in them. Chan masters sometimes employed eccentric and even antinomian pedagogical techniques in their attempts to liberate their disciples from false dualistic perceptions of reality. The Chan master M azu (707-786), for example, grabbed the nose of his disciple Baizhang (749-814) and twisted it until the latter reached enlight-1111'T: 44. 253"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"enment.1306 Another famous mad Chan monk, Daoji alias Jidian (Crazy Ji) or Jigong (1150--1209) became famous for constantly eating meat and drinking large quantities of alcohol. Daoji liked to somersault and when so doing he sometimes revealed his private parts. Shahar cites the following episode of his life which displays his unconventional behavior. [The abbot] said: \"Is there anyone in this assembly who remembers what happens at the moment [of enlightenment]?\" Daoji happened to be washing in the bathhouse next door and he overheard the question. \"I understand this,\" he said to himself. Hurriedly he fastened his bathrobe, threw on his cassock, and rushed into the Assembly Hall. Pressing his palms together in salute to the master, he said: \"I remember what happens at that moment.\" The abbot said: \"Since you know; why not reveal it in front of the whole assembly.\" Then and there Daoji somersaulted in front of the dharma seat, revealing that thing that he had in front. The monks covered their mouths and burst out laughing.1307 The Indian siddha Naropa had to undergo a series of seemingly meaningless trials for twelve years while following his guru Tilopa. Then, suddenly, Ti-lopa hit Naropa on his forehead with his shoe and Naropa fainted. \"When he came to, all the qualities of his teacher's wisdom mind had arisen within him. Teacher and disciple had become one in realization.\"13tll! Naropa passed on his tradition to the Tibetan translator Marpa who transmitted it to Milarepa. Milarepa similarly had to undergo several seem-ingly meaningless and demanding trials before Marpa would instruct him. Since this is the very tradition that gTsang smyon inherited from Sha ra rab 'byams pa, it is perhaps logical that he acted as he did. In many ways he resembles the early bKa' brgyud masters much more than do sGam po pa and other bKa' brgyud dignitaries. It is, however, important to remember that it was gTsang smyon and his disciples who wrote down and printed many of the well-known hagiographies about the Indian siddhas and their Tibetan heirs. This makes it difficult to separate gTsang smyon and his dis-ciples (who compiled the stories) from Milarepa, Marpa, Naropa, and the other masters (who are depicted in them). This study has tried to show that the mad behavior of the Tibetan yogin gTsang smyon Hemka can be explained with the help of Buddhist doctrines and practices. Seen from the most ancient Indian perspective, he was a great ascetic and homeless wanderer, akin to Indian ascetics and proto §aiva fig-ures that have been attested in India long before Buddhism arose. Seen from an ancient Buddhist perspective, he could be likened to the ascetic monks 1306 Shahar 1998: 32. 1307 Shahar 1998: 61-62. uos Patru1 Rinpoche 1994: 159, dPal sprul rin po che 2004: 251: brgyal songs pa dang bla ma 'i thugs rgyud kyi yon tan thorns cad nii ro pa 'i rgyud Ia skyes nos dpon slob gnyis dgongs pa dbyer med du gyur nos 'dug. 254"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"who adhered to the dhutagui)Q practices, and in some ways he even resem-bles Buddha Sakyamuni. Both gTsang smyon and the Buddha were home-less wanderers and meditators. Another similarity between them is that they were supported by powerful rulers; the Buddha was supported by the rulers who gave the Sangha land, and gTsang smyon by Don yod rdo 1je, bKra shis dar rgyas and others. Their position was thus paradoxical; at the same time as they were ascetic outsiders, they were influential and well-connected reli-gious leaders. Seen from a Mahayana perspective, gTsang smyon was abo-dhisattva who acted in a completely selfless manner. Having realized the emptiness of self and phenomena, he was able to work solely for the sake of the Buddhist doctrine and sentient beings. In particular, from a Vajrayana perspective, he could be seen as a tantric siddha who practised the advanced Buddhist tantras. Finally it should be emphasized that trickster-like mad masters are noth-ing unique to Tibetan Buddhism. Similar figures are not only found in other forms of Buddhism, but can be observed in many different religions. Even in the Bible we find how'the apostle Paul in his letter to the Corinthians says that: We are fools for Christ's sake, while you are such sensible Christians. We are weak; you are so powerful. We are in disgrace; you are honored. To this day we go hungry and thirsty and in rags; we are roughly handled; we wander from place to place (! Cor. 4: 10-11 ).1309 These words by Paul could be used to justify a mad conduct among Chris-tians, and the most poignant example are probably \"the holy fools\" or \"fools for the sake of Christ\" in Russian Orthodox Christianity. Ewa M. Thompson writes that before the October Revolution, the population of practically every sizable Russian town included a strange-looking person called iurodivyi (holy fool). These holy fools were the wards of the town, and people gave them food and shelter. \"In exchange for their kindness, the holy fool often abused his benefactors, or at best treated them with indifference,\" Thompson continues.1310 The holy fools were naked or dressed in strange garments. They were dirty and often covered their bodies with bells, strings, and other things that made them look peculiar. Thompson also mentions that their proper element was not hermitages and solitude, but a neighborhood gather-ing or a marketplace; \"In such surroundings they shouted, cried, abused the passers-by and prophesied. \"1311 Neither the mad Buddhist yogins nor the holy madmen of other religions fit into the conventional picture of a religious and holy figure. They act in-appropriately, they mock others, and they puzzle and surprise us with their 1309 The New English Bible: New Testament 1964· 273 13\\0 . . Thompson 1987: I. Ill!

At first glance, the mad masters do not seem to fit in with the religions to which they nevertheless are affiliated. But could it perhaps be the other way around? Do they represent something fundamental, rather than peripheral in religion? These figures are interesting since they challenge our preconceptions about Buddhism and about religion. Instead of giving us simple answers and a nice coherent picture, they chal-lange us to broaden our minds and change our narrow perspectives and pre-conceived ideas about religion in general and Buddhism in particular. Per-haps Buddhism is not what we have thought it to be? Perhaps religion is not what we have thought it to be? Maybe samsara is nirvana? A figure like gTsang smyon not only challenges our picture of Buddhism and of religion, he also raises a more general question about who is mad and who is not. From the perspective of the mad yogin, it is other people who are mad. In our madness we mistake the mad yogins for being insane, when they are actually quite sane. gTsang smyon once received the following question from a Buddhist master he met: \"I heard that there is a mad vagabond (bya bra/ smyon pa) around. Are you he?\" \"There are different ways of looking at it; the way I look at it you are the one who is mad. [ ... ) For achieving buddhahood in this life [I) am called crazy.\" [gTsang smyon] said. [Hearing gTsang smyon's answer], everyone burst into laughter and went away.lll2 • llll For the citation in full, and the Tibetan text, see above, p 145. 256"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Illustrations Figure I.

Abstract gTsang smyon Heruka ( 1452-1507) is one of Tibet's most famous mad yo gins. The mad yo gins represent a relatively unknown aspect of Tibetan Buddhism that flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries. The mad yogins (and their disciples) claimed that they were following in the footsteps of the Indian Buddhist siddhas, and carrying out advanced Buddhist tantric practices by acting in unconventional and transgressive ways. Like some of the Indian siddhas, gTsang smyon started his religious career as a monk. When he was about twenty years old, inspired by a vision of his meditation deity, he suddenly started to act in a seemingly crazy manner. He left his monastery and spent the rest of his life wandering around as a homeless vagabond, practising a form of radical asceticism called \"disciplined conduct\". Soon after he left his monastery, his antinomian and mad behavior led people to begin to call him gTsang smyon-\"The Madman of gTsang\" Paradoxically, gTsang smyon's crazy way of acting and dressing seems to have contributed to making him popular and successful. According to his hagiographies, gTsang smyon was supported by several powerful political leaders. This made it possible for him to accomplish the deeds for which he later became famous: compiling and printing the hagiography and song collection of the bKa' brgyud master Milarepa ( 1052-11 35); and also compiling an extensive collection of the Aural Transmissions of the bKa' brgyud tradition. The most important aims of the present study are to describe how gTsang smyon was transformed into a mad yogin - a heruka - and to look at his subsequent activities as a mad yogin. The main sources on which the dissertation is based are three Tibetan hagiographies written by his disciples.

Because of his provocative and apparently mad way of acting, people started to call h im the \"Madman of gTsang\" (gTsang smyon). In the late 15'h and early H)'h centuries several mad yogins roamed the Tibetan plateau. Their strange and outrageous behavior modi-fies the picture of Buddhism in general, and of Tibetan Buddhism in particular. Since similar figures can also he found in other religions, gTsang smyon and the mad yogins of Tibet shed light upon a rela-tively common, hut sometimes neglected religious phenomenon. The main sources of the study are three Tibetan hagiographies writ-ten by gTsang smyon's disciples in the 16'h century. These texts are only available in Tibetan, and a central part of the study is devoted to presenting, contextualizing and analysing their contents, focusing upon the first thirty years of gTsang smyon's life.
