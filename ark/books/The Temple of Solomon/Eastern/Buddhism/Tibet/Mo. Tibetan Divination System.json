A few of these pub­lications have dealt with our life and culture in a bal­anced way, discussing them in their proper context. However, the majority of books have looked at one aspect of Tibet in isolation from the whole. This may leave the reader with a disjointed view of Tibet. The work presented here-MO: Tibetan Divination System -should be seen against the entire backdrop of Tibetan culture. The Mo should not be seen as a spuri­ous religious practice, unconnected with the profound teachings of the Buddha which underlie the life of the Tibetan people. In Buddhism, especially in the Mahayana tradition, it has been taught that the highest good is to benefit other living beings. This is exemplified by the bodhisattva, a being who strives to gain the stage of pure and perfect enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings. Numerous scriptures tell us that a bodhisattva should not hesitate to use any method that would bring relative and ultimate happiness to others. The bodhi­sattva has been enjoined to assist others by giving them"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 Mo: Tibetan Divination System spiritual teachings, material objects such as medicine and food, fearlessness, loving kindness and advice on how to deal with the travails of worldly existence. Since the Buddhas are endowed with knowledge of the cause and effect of all conditions as well as in­sight into their ultimate reality, the use of Mo could prove beneficial if combined with unwavering faith in and one-pointed concentration upon the Buddhas. Mo is thus one of the ways in which unenlightened beings may rely upon the Buddhas to help overcome predica­ments in their everyday lives. There are two primary functions of the Mo. First of all, it is a system that allows us to help ourselves to see a situation or event clearly. Secondly, if we use it for others with the proper motivation of performing a self­less act of giving -as has been extensively done by many of the great teachers of Tibet -it is a system that enhances our practice of the Bodhisattva's path. There is also a secondary function of the Mo. The central, most profound teaching of the Buddha is Pratitya Samutpada, which may be translated as interdependent origination or co-dependent arising. This teaching si­multaneously explains the essence of the interplay of causes and conditions on the relative, worldly level of reality and the essence of emptiness, or selflessness, on the ultimate level of reality. Although diligent ef­forts are needed in concentration and insight to attain a realization of interdependent origination, a system such as Mo reveals a glimpse of the interdependence and causal play of the world in which we live and may hopefully induce one to investigate it on a deeper level."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Foreword 9 Many methodologies of Mo have been utilized in Tibet. The system here, compiled by the great master Jamgon Mipham from the sacred Tantras expounded by the Buddha, obtains its authority from the spiritual power and wisdom of Manjushri -the Bodhisattva who embodies the transcendental knowledge of all the Buddhas. It is Manjushri's speech as epitomized in his holy mantra, OM AH RA PA TSA NA DHI, and the sanctity of his all-pervasive wisdom that empower one to obtain an accurate answer that reflects the interplay of conditions concerning the situation and its outcome. In the Manjushri Nama Samgiti (Chanting the Names of Manjushri), the Buddha himself extolled the great qualities of Manjushri and stated that the mantra of Manjushri, OM AH RA PA TSA NA DHI, is an expres­sion of the wisdom experienced by all enlightened beings. Therefore, by relying upon the compassionate blessings of Manjushri and the power of his mantra, you should have no doubt that the wisdom of all en­lightened beings is manifesting itself in the throw of the dice. The two translators of MO: Tibetan Divination Sys­tem, Lobsang Dagpa and Jay Goldberg, have explored the Dharma at many levels and their understanding of the scriptures is clearly seen in the fine work they have produced here. This translation presents to the English-speaking world another addition to the accu­rate and growing body of literature concerning our land of Tibet. -H.H. Sakya Trizin"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION In Tibet, the use of the Mo, or predictive technique, has been heavily relied upon throughout the centu­ries, as it has been the general practice of Tibetans to consult some method of prognostication when ques­tions arise concerning various occurrences in their lives -bad dreams, the arising of an illness, the un­dertaking of some work or travel, or even the wish to engage in spiritual disciplines or practices. A great variety of methods have been used to ex­tract omens for the future. The use of dice, as presented in this book, is only one of those methods, one coming down to us from ancient times. The various predictive techniques which employ the use of dice are related to different deities within the tantric tradition -generally, the Protectors of the pharma are the type of deity most relied upon. In this specific case, however, it is the great Bodhisattva of Wisdom, Manjushri, whose blessings and advice are sought in order to ascertain an answer for one's problems or inquiry. Since Manjushri is rec­ognized as the embodiment of the wisdom of all the Buddhas of the past, present and future, people have been confident over the centuries that he would prop­erly guide them through the vicissitudes of worldly"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 Mo: Tibetan Divination System existence and lead them through his transcendent wis­dom to accept what was most beneficial and to aban­don all that would be of harm. Furthermore, they trusted that his guidance would eventually lead them to the state of ultimate peace and enlightenment. Based primarily upon the Kalachakra Tantra and with supplementary explanations from The Ocean of Dakin is and other texts, this prediction manual of the mantra AH RA PA TSA NA DHI was composed by Jamgon Mipham (Jamyang Namgyal Gyatso), 1846-1912, a great saint and scholar of the Nyingmapa tradition. Jamgon Mipham is considered one of the great lumi­naries of Tibet during this past century, due primarily to his scholarship and continual practice of the Buddha's teaching. Born in eastern Tibet, his principal teachers were Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Patrul Rinpoche. With them and others, he studied the doc­trines of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism as well as the five major and five minor subjects of scholarship, such as poetry, astrology, medicine, gram­mar, logic and philosophy. He was renowned for his lucid explanations of the Sutras and Tantras found within the teachings of the Buddha, though within the more than thirty-two volumes of his writings are found works concerning the architectural methods for con­structing temples and houses, astrology, methods of casting predictions (with an entire volume dedicated to the explanation of a Bonpo method for revealing future events through the tying of various knots), po­etry, and a vast array of other subjects. In brief, he was a consummate scholar as well as a great practitioner of the path of Dharma."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Method for Using This Divination Manual Introduction 13 Before making a divination, it is recommended that you perform a few preliminary meditations. First of all, imagine that the great Bodhisattva of Wisdom, Manjushri, is in the sky in front of you. His body is yellow, with one face and two hands. His right hand holds aloft the flaming sword of wisdom, while his left hand holds at his heart the stem of a blue lotus flower. The flower blossoms beside his left ear, and upon it rests a copy of The Book of the Perfection ofWis­dom (Prajnaparamita). His two feet are crossed in the vajra posture and he appears in the form of a sixteen­year-old boy. Thinking that he is blessing the dice with which you are going to make the prediction, recite the following verse: Om, the magnificent Manjushri who possesses the eye of transcendental wisdom which unobstructedly sees all three times, please take heed of me. Through the power of the truth of the non-deceivingi interde­pendently arising Three Jewels and Three Roots please make clear what should be accepted and what discarded. Next, you should recite the mantra of Manjushri: OM AH RA PA TSA NA DHI This mantra, which is pronounced OM AH RA PA CHA NA DEE, is one of the principal mantras of Manjushri. Though having no specific translation, the five middle syllables -AH RA PA TSA NA -are said to represent the five families of the Buddhas, while the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 Mo: Tibetan Divination System final syllable, DHI, represents the wisdom of all the Buddhas. You should also recite the mantra of Interdependent Origination: OM YEDHARMA HETU PRA-BHAWA HETUNTE KHEN TA THAGATO HAYA WATET TE KHEN TSAYO NIRODHA EWAM WADI MAHA SHRAMANA SOHA. . , This mantra, which is pronounced OMjYEA DAR MAjHEH TOOjPRA BAH WAHjHEH TUN TAYj KENjTA T'AGATOEjHAYAjWA TETjTAYjKENj CHA YOjNEERODAj EHVAMjWADEEjMA HAj SHRA MA NAjSO HA, may be roughly translated as: The Tathagata (Buddha) has explained the ori­gin of those things which a�se from a cause; their cessation too he has explained; this is the doctrine of the great sage. This mantra is actually a pith instruction of the Bud­dha's profound insight into interdependent origination. The first mantra should be recited three or seven times (or more, if you wish), and the second mantra should be recited one, three or seven times. In conclusion, blow upon the dice to endow it with the power of the mantras. Then, keeping in mind your question and also the name of the person for whom you are casting the prediction (if it is not being thrown on your own behalf), cast the dice two times and.then examine the answer. For example, if at the first throw of the dice the letter RA appears, and at the second the letter DHI appears, then you should search for the answer RA DHI, which is number 12."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Answers Introduction 15 Each answer of this prediction system is divided into several parts. First, the name of the answer is given; the lead paragraph explains the name using metaphors and symbols, while the next paragraph characterizes the answer, often by quoting some source in order to show the general trend of the answer. Following this, eleven categories are listed with specific predictions for each, and finally a supplementary name is given. The eleven main categories cover all the possible questions that you put forth to the book. They are listed below, with a brief description of the realm of experi­ence that each covers. Family, property and life: foundations of your life, in­cluding anything dealing with your physical life or vitality, your family and property. Intentions and aims: the goals and aims you may seek within your business, as well as other aspects of your life. Friends and wealth: the people you associate with as well as your financial affairs and business affairs. Enemies: description of any enemies you may have. Guests: this category was necessary in Tibet where it might take a guest several months to arrive, so there was always a concern for visitors en route. Illness: the state of your health. Evil spirits: possibility of your troubles arising from some negative forces, such as spirits or unwholesome environmental conditions."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 Mo: Tibetan Divination System Spiritual practice: obstacles and outlook for spiritual practices. Lost article: whether a lost article can be found and where. Will they come, and will the task be accomplished: the meet­ing with another and the possibility of accomplishing some work. All remaining matters: covers any other question which may not fall under any of the above categories. Not only are answers given, but also advice is prof­fered regarding how to overcome particular problems. Generally, a specific spiritual practice, a ritual or the reliance upon a certain deity is proposed. The com­mon Tibetan did not have the ability to perform these rituals or meditations, so it was (and continues to be) the practice for the inquirer to approach the local mon­astery or those who were learned in the performance of rituals to do whatever was needed on his or her be­half. Therefore, although you may be unfamiliar with some of the names of deities, rituals and texts, the au­thors left them in the translation with the thought that you may have the opportunity to approach someone with that knowledge. Once these remedies are under­stood they can be used by the inquirer to help over­come the problem or to accomplish one's aims and wishes. To ascertain whether an answer is very firm or weak, it is advisable to throw the dice two more times. If the same two syllables are repeated, then this means that your ansWer is very firm. If the two syllables reverse"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 17 themselves, then the answer is a weak one. If the two syllables of the subsequent toss are different, then your answer is good as it stands. You can also look into the answer from other per­spectives. For example, whether the prediction is fa­vorable or unfavorable for the present time, it is good to perform another throw of the dice in regards to the future. In this way you can make predictions for dif­ferent times. If the question you ask is a very serious one, such as one concerning a major illness, then it is good to make several predictions about it. If it is only a small matter, then one prediction is enough. Supplementary Interpretive Material The six syllables of the dice allow for a range of inter­pretation. Several levels of meaning are listed below. In a sense, there is an outer and inner meaning to the syllables and their relationship to each other. It is said that if the two syllables appear the same, such as DHI DHI, PA PA, etc., then the outer and inner mean­ings are the same. In regards to your relations with others, you can. throw two predictions. The first concerns yourself, while the second concerns the other person. Otherwise, even within one prediction you can regard the first syllable to represent yourself while the second syllable represents the other person. Then examine the rela­tionship between the two syllables."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 Mo: Tibetan Divination System When the syllable OHI appears first, we can see the following meanings: if OHI OHI appears, this indicates increasing; if OHI AH appears, this indicates equanimity; if OHI RA appears, this indicates unimpeded continuity; -if OHI TSA appears, this indicates favorable­ness and the likelihood of the quick accomplishment of the question; if OHI PA appears, this indicates that activities such as marriage, engagements, and the like will be good. If the syllable OHI appears as the second part of the answer, then this is not bad and the propitiation of deities will find success. The appearance of the syl­lable OHI portents increasing for those who had noth­ing previously. If the syllable AH appears first in the combination, then the answer is only mediocre. If it appears as the second part of the answer, then you will have no ob­stacles in regards to your inquiry. In regards to curing a disease, the appearance of the syllable AH is good. The syllable RA is concerned with the desires of your mind; the syllable TSA is concerned with mes­sages; PA with the joy of your property; while NA is connected with your area or country. The syllables AH, OHI, RAand TSAhave insight wis­dom, violence and the waning moon in common, while NA and PAhave concentration, gentleness and the wax­ing moon in common.
