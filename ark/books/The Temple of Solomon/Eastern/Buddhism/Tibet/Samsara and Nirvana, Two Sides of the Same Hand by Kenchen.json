I bow down to the lamas of unequaled kindness Whose compassionate hands pluck the migrators From their wanderings throughout limitless samsara and Set them down in the land of enlightened bliss. All the varied happiness and suffering of samsara and nirvana Arise from the appearance-emptiness non-dual nature; To refresh my recollection of the Dharma, and that of others as well, I have written these words, relying on the Conqueror’s teachings. Even though all these phenomena (dharmas) are naturally pure Free of arising, free of abiding, free of ceasing The Teacher, skilled in means, taught all the Dharma So that we may realize authentically this reality nature. The glorious Chandrakirti spoke of this with these words: “The Teacher taught that all dharmas are Pacified from beginningless time, are free of arising, and are Naturally and wholly transcendent of suffering; Therefore, they have always been unborn.” Samsara and nirvana are actually Of the same mode of abiding; and as such There is not the smallest distinction between them in the ‘Samsara-nirvana equal-ness’. Samsara is mind with its conceptions; Nirvana, nonconceptual freedom from action and actor – So samsara and nirvana of two sides of the same hand, Mind-as-it-is: self-arisen, unchanging, and spontaneous.

Confusion is samsara’s aspect; its Characteristic, unceasing suffering; Nirvana is confusion purified and awakened – Our suffering has no established basis. What is samsaric confusion? (1) innate dharmadhatu, the basis of confusion All dharmas have the characteristic of space, Beyond any limiting existence / non-existence elaboration; At the same time, as various dharma-instances, Clouds of holder-and-held obscure (confuse) the expanse. (2) wavering of fundamental non-knowing (ma-rigpa), the cause of confusion Failing to recognize (ma-rigpa) the innate wisdom among the Disarray of habitual conceptual thought, our Tangled mess of afflictive emotions Continues to wander in samsara. Buddha, Nagarjuna, and Jigten Sumgön all taught “It is the body that cycles through samsara”; Our propensities of karmas, afflictions, and sufferings Cycle through samsara in dependence upon a body. The countless types of mental afflictions, Desire-attachment, aversion-hatred, and ignorance, Pride, jealousy, and all the rest, are the Creators of our samsaric existence. Some of their negative work is Suffering and unhappiness, Restlessness and muddled thought – Making untoward both this life and the next. The afflictions create the sufferings of becoming, birth, and the rest1, Corrupt our happiness and virtue, obstruct our liberation,   1 The twelve links of this wheel of becoming are listed in the endnotes."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"7-Jun-09 Samsara and Nirvana, Two Sides of the Same Hand 3 Discourage and exhaust us, cause us to squander our Leisure and endowment, and lead us to the lower realms. The afflictions wake up and stabilize the Dormant propensity for grasping-as-real ignorance, Pervert our observations, and reinforce each other, And so continue without interruption. The afflictions cause prosperity’s decline in both Existence and peace, and are objects of criticism for sublime beings – For all these reasons, it is clear that there is Immeasurable fault in this collection of mental afflictions. Because the afflictions have no sickness and death Samsara will be without beginning or end Until concurrent shamata-vipashana Cuts them off at the root. (3) no beginning, the timeframe of confusion Self-expressivity arises unceasingly from the All-basis equal-ness dharmadhatu; this is Patterned by the confusion of fundamental non-knowing and Ingrained as pernicious grasping-as-real. Until the clouds of conceptual thought, profused since beginningless time In the free-of-arising-and-ceasing sky of mind-as-it-is, are Scattered by the wind of wisdom, we will continue to Experience our own self-made suffering. (4) self-fixation, the entity of confusion Self-awareness, unrecognized, grasping at ‘self’; Self-appearance, misunderstood, grasped as ‘objects’ – Oh, how emotionally afflicted are we sentient beings, Trapped in the wheel of samsara by this dualism! Holding unclean to be clean, impermanent to be permanent, Suffering to be happiness, and the selfless to possess self-ness – These four perverted mindsets are the anchor keeping us in the Artificial and temporary cyclic existence that is samsara. (5) in what way is it confused? When mind-as-it-is is not realized to be free of elaboration, the Resulting object-design is outer and inner, container and contained –"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"7-Jun-09 Samsara and Nirvana, Two Sides of the Same Hand 4 All confusion of attachment and aversion, holder and held Arises from fixation on this ‘self and other’. (6) the result of being thus confused The afflictions are both cause and condition For the arising of all karma; from that karma Manifests the six realms of samsara, Oppressed by the three sufferings. Thus, this variegated wheel of becoming Does not come from nothing, without cause and condition, but Arises from the confusion-wheel of one’s own mind, and so is the Object to be realized by the wheel of wisdom. Some of the time from beginningless time through today We have enjoyed the glory of the gods; some of the time, We have experienced the blazing fires of hell – but these experiences of Happiness and suffering are no more than a dream to us now. All manner of attractive things are possible with Modern science and technology, but Trying to obtain happiness from them is like Trying to quench our thirst with mirage-water. While wanting happiness, we experience only suffering, and We will not find release from this abysmal suffering Until we have abandoned our karma and afflictions – We each must do our own investigation into this. When we attain unsurpassable enlightenment, We will find the nature of confusion to be none other than Wisdom, and all that will remain of suffering will be its name – This is the way to annihilate confusion. (7) examples of this confusion During sleep and dream, we are Burned by fire, carried away by floods, and the like; We either experience the happiness and suffering, or Wrap ourselves in a protective cocoon. Nothing appearing to our senses has ever been real, They are all experiences of a dream-state; likewise it is the Hope and fear involved with ignorance, grasping-as-real, and Attachment-aversion that produces our state of samsaric confusion."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"7-Jun-09 Samsara and Nirvana, Two Sides of the Same Hand 5 All these dharma-instances are in fact reflections of our Habitual tendencies, and are illusory, like a bubble or a dew-drop; the Moon reflected on water has no nature of moon, but Dependent as it is on causes and conditions, appears as if by magic. How is this confusion purified? (1) the method with which to eliminate confusion Any fortunate one there may be who desires release from the Great inescapable prison of cyclic existence needs to Use the following method – the liberation-path that cuts off confusion in Dependence upon the scripture and realization of the sublime Dharma: impermanence For all appearances, these composite interdependencies of causes and conditions, All birth is followed by death, all meeting by parting, All accumulation by exhaustion, and all youth by dissipation; Do not be attached to this life – contemplate its impermanence! Appearances of the past are like a dream, not here now; Those of the future are like the horn of a rabbit, not here now; The momentary ‘now’ is like a ripple on a lake – Hold in your heart the quintessential, sublime Dharma! suffering In the three miserable migrations of hell-being, hungry ghost, and animal, Beings are powerless to prevent their enslavement and killing; Their suffering is like waves of fire, never-ending – O my! Wise one, generate compassion for them! Tossed violently by the waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death In the ocean of samsara with no bottom or shore, Desiring happiness but craving the causes of suffering – O, how weary are the sentient beings who have no protector! causality None of us can prevent the results of preceding causes and conditions, They are infallible for us all; furthermore, there is Moment-cycle causality, the arising of variegated Samsara-nirvana as the self-expression of virtue and non-virtue.

With a natural manner of brave heart-mind, I take into my mind-stream every one of the Qualities of abandonment and realization of all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the three times. In samsara, from beginningless time through today, the Sole cause bringing the suffering is always my own Self-fixation / fundamental non-knowing – I give this away, right now, without a second thought.

Our heads are left spinning at this confusion within confusion; but All the various outer phenomena are just the same – Other than merely appearing, they are not actually there. The Samadhi-Raja Sutra states it in this way: “A young woman in a dream gives birth to a son Only to watch him die; she is happy when he is Born and unhappy when he dies – Know that every single phenomena is just like this.” All this current world of appearance Appears real to a confused mind, but when Fundamental awareness rests in the sphere of dharmata, There is not even a speck of anything, real or fake. Because everyone – oneself and others – die, we are not real, and Death itself is not real, but like an illusion; Because the material world is destroyed by fire and water, it is also unreal, And the four elements themselves are unreal, interdependently. (3) the cause-and-condition dependency of the method to eliminate confusion Confusion is dispelled when the cause that abides in the Basic character, buddha nature, meets the condition of a Qualified lama’s instruction, taken into a disciple’s heart – Similar to what happens when ice is exposed to heat. Make every effort to put into practice the instructions of a Benevolent spiritual teacher, skilled in means. Dharma Lord Rin-chen-päl has taught: “ ‘Phantom men ford mirage-rivers’, ‘Sky-lotuses are sipped from by dream-bees’, ‘Barren women’s sons sing the gandharva’s songs’; ‘The Ultimate may be realized in the midst of busy activity’ – These are the words of childish ones devoid of experience and realization.” “When our minds, stainless and virtuous,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"7-Jun-09 Samsara and Nirvana, Two Sides of the Same Hand 11 Melt into the sublime Dharma, the Forest of great bliss flourishes On the non-dual mountain; Undistracted, mindful deer graze here, consuming the Grass and water of bliss, clarity, and non-conceptuality – Seeking solitude? This is the place. I, the yogin, will keep to this mountain retreat.” (4) when confusion may be reversed We of the six realms with a good body-support of leisure and endowment, Who are also possessed of faith, will renounce the samsaric state; We will then have an opportunity to wear the armor of perseverance in the Sublime Dharma and free ourselves from the ocean of suffering. Leisure and endowment are difficult to find – recognizing the Importance of this precious life, be smart and strive for the ease of freedom With supreme bodhicitta, relative and absolute, and Without distraction to matters of this life alone. (5) what remains after confusion has been eliminated Our mind’s stainless mode of abiding manifests With the unification of awareness and emptiness – This innate, ordinary awareness is what is called ‘Confusion dawning as wisdom’. Unstoppable mere-dawning self-lustre is the basis of interdependence; Non-establishment of any existence or non-existence is emptiness; Unified, they do not abide as one or separate – Self-disposition, free of directionality, the all-pervasive basis. (6) the opposite of confusion The omniscient wisdom that realizes the mode of abiding Comprehends in the dharmata-sphere dharma-instances in all their complexity; Integrated body-mind has no fixation on either – no Clinging-attachment to the body nor to awareness-emptiness mind-as-it-is. The omniscient wisdom that unifies the two truths Has no attachment to retinue or relatives and No aversion to any enemy or victimizer; All are equal in the dharma expanse – how wonderful!

Firm and deep are the wish-granting tree’s roots of three trainings; Its branches and leaves of two-fold bodhicitta flourish infinitely; Blooming beautifully are its flowers of unified generation-completion; and Its fine fruits are three kayas of benefit for the migrators. All-pervasive, un-rivaled, luminous mahamudra, the Mode of abiding of our own non-arising mind, that called ‘Confusion dawning as wisdom’, and the enlightened qualities of Separation and maturation – all parts, wholly completed. In a single atom are all atoms of the universe; All atoms of the universe are pervaded by a single atom – Know one object of knowledge and be expert in them all; Know them all and understand the one. Dharmakaya: the two obscurations are purified to sky-like, so it is pure; all Elaborations of self and non-self are pacified, so it has entity; its Dharmadhatu has no fluctuation, so it is permanent; and its mental-body is Purified of gross and subtle latent tendencies, so it is at ease.

Until every drop of the ocean of existence is dried up Limitless activities of enlightened body, speech, and mind will Reach to every sentient being non-conceptually and spontaneously, Like the sun, the clouds, the earth, and the water. And so, regarding the mind’s mode of abiding: Whoever has not realized it cycles endlessly in samsara; Whoever has realized it is liberated to nirvana; therefore, In the practice of the nature of mind, be diligent!

Perceiving the stainless and precious, unsurpassable and sublime Dharma of the Teacher to be the source of all relative and ultimate benefit and happiness, I have spent many long years, with pure altruistic intention, obtaining whatever of it I have been able in the far-flung countries of this world. Unfortunately, these days both my body and mind are sometimes overpowered by a strong exhaustion that does not respond much to medicine or treatment, and so I recently took some time to rest and recover in the American city of Madison. While there, in early spring of 2009, with an altruistic mind hoping to benefit those who seek the meaning of the Dharma, and contemplating how the demarcation between samsara and nirvana is delineated by virtue and non-virtue, I, Khenchen Konchog Gyaltshen, composed this text, entitled Samsara and Nirvana, Two Sides of the Same Hand (literally: “The Wheel of Wisdom: Samsara and Nirvana, Front and Back of the Hand”), in dependence upon Kyobpa Jigten Sumgön’s profound Dharma and skilled teachings – may it bring about infinite benefit for the Teaching and for all the migrators!

Many thanks to Lama Gyaltshen for his kind assistance with typesetting of the Tibetan.
